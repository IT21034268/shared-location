1,"NOT FUNNY, CAMPY, OR CLEVER . . .","This Movie has to Win Top Prize for Most Annoying Characters in one Movie. The lead guy ""Caesar"" has to be the worst character ever caught on film. I Don't know how this is getting 5 star reviews, it is painfully awful to sit through... I was just waiting for them all to DIE! I hate this movie, and everyone in it. If you want to see a GOOD Horror Comedy, with Lots of Laughs and Plenty of Gore, go watch ""TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL"" Instead!"
5,tasty goodness for your earhole.,"Take some at the drive-in, a tablespoon of ima robot, a dash of les savy fav, and something else that I can't quite put my finger on, but im damn glad its there... and you got The Kinison. Every track on this CD is amazing. Buy it, listen to it really really loud in your car, and don't worry about changing CD's for the next 4 or 5 days. Sorry to sound like a comercial for The Kinison, but its that good."
5,I GAINED MY LIFE BACK!!!,"My life was lost, due to fibromyalgia, until a good friend gave me Dr. Dryland's book. His diagnosis made sense. The best part is there is a ""cause"" and a ""solution"". My own doctor, after some research, let me start taking mirapex. And!! Whala!! After starting at a very low dose, and moving up to an optimal dose, I am pain free. It is a miracle. It has been 3 months and I still feel no pain. I have never met Dr. Dryland, but because of him I GAINED MY LIFE BACK!! YOU CAN TOO! READ HIS BOOK AND WORK WITH YOUR DOCTOR. You will thrive again. Cynthia Wagner, California"
4,rock and rap confidential tell us,"Veteran Canadian rapper Moka Only's themes are sensual, with singing folding back over the raps, horns sneak in, beats mutate into 6/8 time."
1,Total dissapointment,"This is definitely the only awful cd that I have ever heard from Battle Axe records. The lyrics are ok but everything else needs extreme work. The beats are slow, boring, and uninteresting. The production on this cd is not very good which leads to very poor quality of sound for the cd in general. Moka shines on everything else he does but this one takes the taco for him and Battle Axe as being terrible. For underground rap not getting too much recognition in general this one is definitely deceiving."
5,Fascinating Historical Novel,"The story starts in Ireland. I know very little about Ireland,so I continued reading.The story is told with avery ""Light Touch"", and the writer ""pulls"" the readerinto the story.I was wondering if the writer herselfwas Irish.Where else would she get this ability to Spin aYarn ? The main characters are very appealing,and I reallyCARED to find out what happens to them.Next the story moves to South America, and then to NorthAmerica.Now, how does the writer know enough about Ireland,South America, and New York, in the Mid- 1800's ?She can not be THAT old ! Or can she ??Apparently she did quite a lot of research.I give heran A+ for this effort .This book is VERY PLEASANT to read.The people are fascinating. The locations are interesting.The plot twistsaround; but,is totally BELIEVEABLE.It is a NICE STORY.Well- written. I recommend it."
3,Dell cord,"This is the second cord I have had to buy for this computer. This one does not seem to charge the computer . It may be my computer battery but it didn't do that with the last cord I purchased from Amazon. However, I do like the way the base of the cord is made so it will not break again there."
2,AC Adapter for Dell Laptop,"At the time I ordered I thought this was a great and fair deal on the price. However, the connecting wire to the adapter is split and the wires are showing. Just noticed it today. This has not been mishandled at all and can think of no reason why this could or should have happened. I just received it the end of September of this year. It's only been about 45 days I can't return it. Need to purchase another one."
2,Fair,"""Will You Be Staying After Sunday"" was a great hit, but that is about it! This album falls into the trap too many 1960s vocal singles band did.The title track is great, but--and this is reletive--is the most edgey song on the album. There is no experimentation with folk, like the Mama's and the Papas, or the jazz streching Spanky and Our Gang moved into later in their run,Pepperment Rainbow stick to safe soft pop that never excites or provokes. Strictly filler sleep.Too bad. If they chose to make a Free Design move to FM, they had the goods."
2,Not his best....,"Fatboy's latest release, ""Fatboy Slims Greatest remixes"" is nothing new to most fans of the great Mr. Cook, and as a fan I was really dissapointed with this release. The content is simply a hash of the remixes he has done for oother poeple. However, I am waiting with heated anticipation for ""The Fatboy Slim/Norman Cook Collection"" on Mar. 27 and hope that this album will be better. I do not reccomend this album unless you are a hardcore fan."
5,great music,"great fun music, Definitly keeps your interest. Came in good timing and good condition for such a little price"
2,Two things that were good in this movie....,"The only good thing that came out of this movie was the plot, and a joke my cousin made while watching it. ""Werewolf with a flame-thrower"". No, there actually isn't one in this movie, but he just randomly said it, and it's awesome.I normally love a Scottish accent, but I couldn't understand a cotton-pickin' word they were saying half the time. And I agree with one of the other reviewers: you can barely see the action. The werewolf makeup/costumes aren't terribly great. And I can't figure out if I like the end of the movie or not (BTW, it's so broadcasted early on in the movie.) Mostly, when my cousins and I talk about this movie, it's titled as ""the movie we never speak of"".Mind, I have high standards for werewolf movies. This DEFINITELY did not meet my standards. I was really looking forward to renting it from my Movie Gallery, and I'd been putting it off and putting it off. Too bad I didn't decide to NEVER rent it."
4,A nice babydoll,This babydoll is in a nice sheer material and looks good on. I agree with other reviews that it is quite flimsey and as it's not padded I found it was not as uplifting as on the model. It's a good length so I felt comfortable in it. The panty to match is a baggy and ill fitting but the baby doll is worth it.
3,SO-SO,This product was just ok for me. But it is really as pictured on the model and it would look better if your tummy is flat. Unfortunately after 3 kids mine isn't.
2,It lookes nice,"Only problem is the bra section being a 38 G/H cup its not good support on the girls but its soft and sexy, just with the under wire and more breast support was handy, bought this for my honeymoon so hopefully it wont stay on long enough for him to notice i have no support on the girls"
5,How pretty this costume!,"Since I had to present for my daughter at her trip with her boy friend, I just found this item. They gave a lot of survenior."
1,"Yes indeed, it's junk","A family member bought one of these emachines a few years back, and it's already gone bust.The machine takes forever to boot, and is a total lemon. No, excuse me, that's an insult to lemons, which have some nutritional value and are great as an extra in all kinds of recipes.The emachine, on the other hand, is a complete waste of good, hard-earned money. Based on the internal family experience, don't even THINK about it."
4,Good Product,The bushings are exactly as advertised. They work great in my truck. The only thing negative is there wasn't any instructions. Instructions were easy to find on line though. A hydralic press is needed to remove old bushings. I got mine removed by a local garage for a small fee.
5,Great Bushings,"I've had these bushing installed on my F250 for over a year now with no problems. Perfect fitment, far better than stock bushings!"
4,Cat who dropped a bombshell,According to the information I saw on LJB she was born in 1916 which would make her only 90.I agree her books are not as good as they used to be but like many others I enjoy a new once a year visit with Qwill and friends. It is more of a fluff book that a mystery but a nice light read. I think she should have made more out of the deaths of Homer Tibbits and Liz Hart. I'm not sure why she would kill off Liz and there is no mention of how Derek took the loss of his special friend.I hope that I can still be breathing at age 90 much less able to write a novel. I think this one is actually better than the last couple. I own every one she has written and love to reread them when I have a chance.
1,"Same old, same old","The first few books of this long series were rather charming mysteries, if a bit too cozy, perhaps, but they have dribbled down to pointless treacle. This book is virtually plotless, with flat characters, silly diialogue, and a vague but over-sweet atmosphere. Abundant use of exclamation points does not make a flat story seem to be dramatic.I'd rather remember the cat who books of the earlier entries in the series. It's time to stop them--now. I, for one, will read no more of them."
1,Worst Cat Who... book ever!!!!!,"I've read the majority of The Cat Who... books over the years. This one was by far the worst. The dialog was corny. If I had a dollar for every exclamation point in the book, I would be a millionaire!!!!!"
4,Not what it used to be...,"I gave this book four stars because I like hearing about Qwill, the cats (especially!) and the characters around Pickax. So, these books are fun fluff that are the equivalent of checking in on old friends.But if you are looking for the mystery, you will be very disappointed. It lasts about 15 (?) very short pages. This series (for whatever reason) has morphed into a story about quaint people in a quaint town. But the mystery gets less and less print with each book.If you want mystery, get the earlier books in the series. If you don't mind hearing about small town antics, this should be fluffy fun."
1,The book that bombed again!,"I am a very loyal reader of The Cat Who Series (I have been reading them for over 10 years) and I have been consistently disappointed with her last 3 books. The plot of this book was anemic and the characters were unimpressive. Koko didn't even seem to solve the 'mystery' and I use that term loosely. Qwill seems to have changed into another person (especially when the deaths of 2 important characters go virtually unremarked upon). Death #2 (I won't give it away) was shocking for me, especially when Qwill didn't seem to care! And this was a character who figured into several books. I feel that this series has gone on too long, is Ms. Braun under contract? Is that why her books have taken a downward turn? Or are her ghostwriters not even bothering to read her previous well written books? Whenever a new title comes out, I only want to re-read her older books and wonder ""what went wrong?"""
1,The cat who waited for paperback,"Something is happening, and the title Bombshell sounds good. The writing does not fit Lilian's style with her prior works at times. The mystery to unfold in the book, that Koko is to clue at doesn't seem to apply to the title. Many of us have found to look for that clue. There were a few mentions of the key word to try and throw us off. The ""expectations"" in her works, usual events seemed to be missing.The suprising events in the book did not seem to be in typical Lilian fashion. Needless to say the later one put me in a flatspin. It's possible time is catching up with her; but my gut told me there was a ghost with a pen (or is Koko III now writing?)For those of you wanting the book; wait for paperback."
2,The Cat Who Wrote a Bomb,"Huh? Where was the mystery in the latest Cat Who series? This book had the same ramblings about the cats, Polly, dining out etc. and no story! I've enjoyed many books by this author but maybe it's time to hang up the qwill....pen......"
3,Good Read,"If you like the ""Cat Who..."" series, then you will enjoy this book. I found that since it is the next to the last book in the series, it is not the best example of this mystery series, but still a nice read. Some of the story line and writing style seems inconsistent with earlier titles. I thought there were too many unanswered questions at the end. But if you gotta have the book to complete your collection (like me!), then read it. And then go back and read some of the books in the middle of the series to remind yourself why you like them so much...."
1,Where's the rest of it?,"Was this just a hiccup in the Cat Who.... series? This book is so thin, just like the plot and everything else going on in the book. The paperback version will probably be 50 pages long. There have been over a dozen books in the series, dedicated readers don't need to be reminded of back story ad nauseum at this point. I always look forward to a night of reading new adventures of Koko, Yum-Yum, and Qwill, but when my book arrived in the mail, I was disappointed that it would be more or less an hour of reading. It's as though it's an afterthought to the last book, as though the author forgot stuff to mention."
4,The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell,I have read all of Lillian Braun's Cat Books and love them. I share them with all my cat loving friends.
3,Something has changed,"I am wondering if Ms. Braun really wrote this book. It just doesn't ""feel"" the same as the others in the series (and I have read them all). Also, why is the name of ""The Old Stone Mill"" restaurant changed to ""The Old Grist Mill"" with no explanation? It's almost as if it were an oversight by the proofreading and/or editing staff."
5,"Wow, so smooth",This is the best indie-folk album I think I've ever heard. Smooth and mellow with some melancholy thrown in there. I have n idea why Correa isn't a huge artist by now. This album is magical
3,Interesting storyline,"This is an unusual story with average acting.I enjoyed the movie but wouldn't say it's a ""have to watch"" movie."
3,"difficult, albeit interesting character","aleister crowley's ""autobiography"" is interesting, compelling... rubbish. crowley's eccentricism can be quite magnetic when it isnt obscured by the fact that he was an absolute loon. fun to read occasionally, no revelations held within."
1,"Unreadable gibberish, but he was a good mountaineer","Outside of his mountaineering exploits, this book is a long, boring confusing account of an eccentric egotists life. Entire chapters of gibberish that I'm sure groveling followers have spent years trying to decipher. Like Anton Lavey, Crowley was a master trickster in his time. They were both brilliant philosophers and were too smart to believe in silly occult dabblings. They did it to make a buck and gain a following. This was the second and last Crowley book I'll ever read."
5,BRAVO MAESTRO!!!!!!!!!,"Excepcional!!!!!!!!!En esta grabación el maestro Luis Orlandini revela una extraordinaria musicalidad y espiritu guitarristico a través de una interpretación llena de virtuosismo, energía y sensibilidad. Realmente le da vida y un sentido muy especial a cada una de las seis Rossinianas. Creo que el maestro además tiene una concepción muy particular de la obra en su contexto global, y nos muestra las Rossinianas en su conjunto como una obra maestra. Los que hemos tendio el privilegio de escucharlo en vivo podemos dar fe de ello.Definitivamente Luis Orlandini es el mejor interprete de esta obra, y posiblemente sea el mejor interprete de Giuliani y de Fernando Sor (los invito a escuchar el CD ""Fernando Sor: Fantaisies"" que sin duda es la mejor grabaci?n que existe de la obra de Sor)."
2,Some good information but a bit of a disappointment,This book has some great information but when I read it I felt it was geared towards Protestants. Most of the materials and books recommended in here are secular or Protestant. I don't recommend this book at all. It will truly confuse you about teaching in a Catholic home and make you feel as though it's okay to teach with Protestant materials. Read Mary Kay Clarks book before buying this one. You won't be disappointed.
4,Excellent Female Action Movie,"If anyone has been tired of only seeing guys being the action buddies in movie and ladies only being the dramatic leads and/or buddies well here is a female action movie that works mainly due to fine performances by Bette Midler and Shelly Long. There are admittedly some weird elements to this film such as the inclusion of some Russian bad guys who I to this day do not know much about. Bette and Shelly play two ladies who find out they go with the same man who was thought dead but only to find out he isn't. They go on a search for him to show whether he loves one or the other. Only to find out he doesn't want anything to do with either of them and would rather get rid of them. Bette easily and naturally plays the tough, brassy, loud, streettalking New Yorker and Shelly the soft-spoken, proper, very ladylike character. The movie does work even with some of its uneven moments!! It will leave you laughing and wanting more."
4,Ill-named,"I love this one, Shelley and Bette are so good together. I just think it's ill-named is all. But be that as it may... When two women, which already dislike each other, discover that they've both been seeing the same man, once believed dead, they set out on a quest. To learn what really happened to the teacher Michael may take more than there training as actresses to pull off. Of course, the KGB and FBI involvement only stirs up the brew more! George Carlin makes a magnificent appearance in this one as well. Over all a hilarious and fun film for all!"
1,Don't bother,"Comedy-caper clunk OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE wastes the considerable talents of Bette Midler and Shelley Long. Both have been in much better films, but even the other bombs in which I've seen them didn't disappoint me as much as OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE. Was the story changed around once Midler and Long signed their contracts, or was the actresses' judgement simply that poor, playing people so stupid that you would think Jessica Hahn and Pia Zadora had first turned down the roles? And what is a title like OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE even supposed to mean? Don't bother trying to figure it out, and don't let OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE pollute your VCR."
2,could have been great,"The limitations of the save game feature really suck. There are only so many times I'll start a game over from the beginning, or put up with losing lots of progress because of the save points. I really like the look and feel of the game and it really could have been a great game. I with the maker would release a patch for the save game or at least a PC style cheat mode (god mode) that would let me get some use out of this purchase. I'll never see my way through this title simply because of the frustration factor. I'd rather cheat and get to go through it all and explore. Too bad. I read that the save feature in DR2 was slightly improved but not enough to make me buy it. I'm a big zombie fan and love the Left 4 Dead games, it is really too bad about DR.. Don't buy unless you have a lot of patience, skill, and a walkthrough because if you screw up you start all over..."
2,not recommend,"the story line is... sloppy. some scene just makes no sense and you don't understand why you doing this or that occasionally.the gameplay is... boring and repetitive. yes it's quite cool to kill and swim in the zombie sea, but after one hour or two, you got hell tired of this.as many ppl mentioned, the game's saving system sucks. if you missed something important, you just can't go back. if you happened to save when you low on HP, you may waste hours to just get to somewhere that you can heal. in a word, the gameplay is just horrible.the graphic is just OK, the zombie models are abundant, meaning you don't see a lot of them in the same shape (let's say games like resident evil 2, there are only about 5 kinds of zombies, hehe) However, our lovely photographer just seems abnormal... when he runs, you can see how weird his motions are. the sounds are poor, the voice acting are poor.i'd not recommend this game to others."
5,This game ROCKED and was OUTSTANDING!,"amazon is the best website to buy games, toys, etc because they are very true to their word that your product will arrive on that specific day... i love shopping at amazon.com so much that i highly recommand it to all of parents, kids, and grandparents because this site is true to its word...when i got the game, i was very very very pleased with the arrival and the condition... they said that i was going to get it 23 days and then it came.... i am HIGHLY IMPRESSED! with amazon....."
1,Seriously broken.,"""The reviewers who give it 5 stars are probably working for the developers and trying to sell more games. Don't fall for it, this ones a 65 dollar turd! 99 things wrong with it""I totally agree.Yea I read many positive reviews here. I'm sure they were PAID!I have an enhanced Def TV and you can't read the text.Or maybe you just need a $3000 TV to read the directions.Will the XBOX be able to download a fix for this please? ITs UNPLAYABLE at the moment.Terrible save system can bump you right back to the beginning after playing for HOURS!Another thing I noticed is that reviews that state the truth are rated bad, so I know the PAID pushers are at work here."
1,"Dead Rising should have never ""rose"" to the market","Well, I thought this game was going to be fun killing zombies and all. Guess what, the game is absolutely horrible. There's not enough action. Yes, if you just want to be killing zombies wasting your time, it's ok. But if you try to follow the game.. well, first of all... you can't, because the font is SO SMALL that you can't read anything. I have a 48"" HDTV and I can't read anything. So following the game is EXTREMELY hard because you don't know what's going on, you miss important details. Second of all, the game play lacks a lot of action... and you're playing as a biggest whimp in the world who can't hold a gun straight at first.The only thing I liked about a game is ""Jessie"" the blonde girl... and that is very pathetic. Horrible game... get GEARS OF WAR instead, truely the best shooting game ever made."
5,Difficult but fantastic,"The graphics for this game are absolutely gorgeous, but the main selling point of this title is the atmosphere.I love the Resident Evil games, but Dead Rising really tops them with its bizarre and scary atmosphere. From killer clowns to scary families who like to shoot at people for fun, the game trumps all others in the survival horror stakes.Strange and very addictive."
2,Outstanding concept hampered by technical flaws.,"This is a great game, make no mistake about it. A GTA-style ""sandbox"" game, only set in a mall during a zombie outbreak. Anyone who's a fan of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD owes it to themselves to get this game.That said, there is a serious technical issue with this game on standard definition TVs. The mission text you are given throughout the game is tiny and blurry, making it all but unreadable. That means you'll go through most of the game with no clear idea of where to go or what to do. this is a real shame, because just about everything else in this game is executed flawlessly. Buyer beware."
3,FUN! But...,"I'll keep the review short, the game IS a lot of fun. What isn't fun is the the horrible saving interface. You have to go to specific areas of the game to save, so my advice is, find those areas and go there often. Its not as easy as it sounds. I didn;t realize that going into it, and of course, I played for almost 2 hours and died only to realize that I had to start from the begining Doop! =)"
3,Huge dissapointment,"When i first got this game, i was filled with excitment and couldn't wait to play. When i first encountered the god awful save system, it was officially ruined for me. You can save at the very beginning, but then all the so called save points are no where to be found. You are forced to repeat everything you do several times in hopes of finally saving your progress, but those hopes go down the toilet. Worth a rental, but defenitly not 60 bucks."
1,Unplayable on most TVs and sucks anyway.,"First off, as many other reviews have noted, the game text is unreadable due to its small size unless you have an HDTV. Perhaps Capcom will offer a patch via Live, but until then the game is largely unplayable.And, even though it's a lot of fun to kill zombies with random stuff, the game sucks anyway. The save system is worse than Resident Evil, the time constraints pretty much kill off your ability to explore what would otherwise be an interesting environment and the gameplay is lousy.I'd advise most people to just rent the game, have fun killing zombies until that gets old, and save about $50. If you really must buy it, you can probably just wait a few weeks and it'll be $25 for a used copy at EB/Gamestop since so many people bought it and can't play it.UPDATE: Capcom will not be patching this game (9/13/2006)."
2,Disappointed,"This game has the worst gun controls ever. It takes forever to get to save points which are few and far between. It did have a few good moments. Some of the weapons are pretty sweet but they get repetitive pretty quickly. Also most of the dialogue you have to read, and it's in very small text which is difficult to read. This game might have been good when it came out but it does not hold up to todays standards in the slightest."
4,Excellent game,"This is a great game that's a lot of fun. There are a few things to consider: 1) there are many side plots that distract you from your real mission, 2) there are a lot of things to do in this game.The graphics and sound are great, giving the feeling that you're in a mall. Without all the distracting side missions, it's very fun."
3,Great fun but annoying,"Ok, first off good game. Great killing zombies. The over used zombie-mall idea is great. Finally, it is used in a game. The decapitations and shooting heads never gets old. BUT the saving system does get old! You will get so far and die and have t go all the way back. Very fustratng. i usually beat games quickly but this one took a while. Hopefuly dead rising 2 will be an improvment"
2,All the negative hype is correct! PLEASE READ!,"The text is terrible. I turned the game off after only about an hour of playing it. The idea behind the game is fun and exciting, but the way Capcom carried it out is pure garbage.I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this game USED. Even paying 25 bucks, I feel I've been ripped off and will be dumping this pos back on ebay.The graphics are status-quo, the text is horrid. I haven't even played far enough to really get into the save issues simply because I was disappointed with the lack of freedom involved in this game. It would have been a lot more fun if this were a game like GTA where you can pick and choose which missions to complete. An even better spin would be to be bitten and to walk the path of a zombie!I must be fair and give this game a 2, I got to one part where I was able to use a lawn mower to ""mow down"" like 30 zombies. That was funny but the game is still a pile of fat fertilizer."
5,My favorite Drill,"This is my 3rd Panasonic Drill. The batteries wear out long before the drill motor and it is cheaper to buy a whole new one. They are my favorite of the cordless drills I own. I have a 28V Milwaukee, and a Makita too."
4,Dealing with the past and forging toward the future,"For anyone who has found themselves a part of the human condition. Leon Uris does an excellent job depicting the life of Gideon, a young author struggling to come to terms with himself, his career, and the haunting past of the Holocaust."
3,My husband LOVES it!,"This was a gift for my husband and he just loves the bag. Great quality and easy to hang. I purchased the accessory set for hanging, but did not need it. My husband just went to Home Depot and brought a bolt/screw for a few bucks, which works perfectly for hanging."
5,"""vibration analysis using Matlab..."" help my life.",This book is a rule of thumb to people who want to have quick and easy access of programing in the vibration analysis field and is a very step-by-step way to develop your skills in this subject. I recomend it to everybody!
3,Impossible to Place,"This single celebrates the one-hundredth release on independent dance label Soma Records with this unlikely collaboration. The trip-hop production group UNKLE, without DJ Shadow, and techno veterans Slam team up for this genre spanning single. The main mix could be described as tech-house, it has a short guitar sample and a stomping beat which lasts around seven minutes. Each group then brings its own remix to the table. Slam turn out a techno remix which is faster than the original, while UNKLE slow things down on their mix, adding a film sample and dark ambience. This single is not equal to the sums of the talents of each production group, but it doesn't sound like anything else on the radio right now. You might like it."
1,so what does it... do?,"I'm not sure what I was expecting this to do, really. It doesn't do what it suggests, I can't tell that does anything. It doesn't pick up any hairs off my long-coated dog, wet or dry. It doesn't get through the dog's coat. It doesn't help distribute shampoo lather. The most useful it's been to me was to try catching the loose hairs floating in the bathwater that came off when I washed with my hands and a regular plastic hair comb. I'd offer it as a toy to the dog, but she'd just eat it."
3,No difference in cat's look,"Coat doesn't look better after using this brush like I was hoping. That was the reason why I got it because I felt that the furminator was damaging the hair, well the zoom doesn't seem to make a difference. The bristles are liked by the cat more but they are big and they leave a raking pattern on the fur. It doesn't pick up hair like a magnet either, it's just like any other brush in that regard."
1,Groomer? NO!,"This would probably work for shampooing your dog, but not as a groomer. I bought it on the advice of a column dedicated to Labs, and they recommended it? Don't know why they did because it picked up 20-30 hairs. More came off petting the dog. I could see it as a massager for the dog or a toy, but not a groomer."
4,Great little scrubber,I really like this doggy scrubber. It's got a great grip even when wet. I have a boxer that doesn't need too much washing but this get to her skin so I can get any dirt or dandruff.
5,Great CD- You gotta buy it,this is one of the best CDs i've ever heard they have a great sound and great songs with excellent melodies
2,Not that good,"I tried to give Rooney a try with both of their CDs and I just didn't like them. The lyrics were lame, out of order, and the transitions were off. They tried to give it a pop-emo feel but they missed. This CD will likely find play time with OC-fans, but other than that, don't waste your time. There's better stuff out there and I would expect better from fellow Californians."
3,Rather than go on and on and on and....,"I will give a rather short summation.I picked up this CD for several reasons (some valid, some not, and others questionable).1. Heard decent buzz, enjoyed the single Blueside and figured I would check the rest out2. Price was 10 bucks so here I am3. Caught a glimpse of the whole BritPop-meets-B. Wilson-meets California pop thing and figured it was an ""interesting"" hybrid to at least give a chance4. I needed a new music pickme up_____Summation:It's Geffen so it's alternative-lite without being lo-fi or too ""indie"". It's polished and accessible, yet showcases some interesting guitar runs, various vocal dynamics, fair amount of melody and some studio trickery to keep it from being totally top 40 ZZZzzzZZZ.Hey at least it's not full-on emo.I recommend it for those who like relatively safe pop music. It's not terribly original yet not terribly familiar.Future will tell I suppose..."
3,Great Start For this Band,"Like eveyone else, Blueside is what drew me into this band. Definite California ""Surfin"" sound to it- no big surprise based on the album cover being the state flag for CA.Actually, after listening to this album a few times, you realize that it is a great album to drive to. You'll have most of the hooks memorized after your first listen....you won't be blown away...but you certainly will not be disappointed.....probably more curious to see what they come out with next.""Popstars"" and ""Stay Away"" are worthy of any mix that you are throwing together."
4,I like it,"This album is very good. Because here is a very good guitarist. He plays many guitar solos. And I like the drummer. The way he's drumming. The best songs are : Blueside, Stay Away, If I were up to me, I'm a terrible person, I'm Shakin, Sorry Sorry. If here would be more keyboards, I would give it 5 stars. I really recommend this album."
3,Not a Bad debut,"I'll give this band some props, they are definately making a nice name for themselves. This cd has a unique, california sound that really makes you want to start swimming or something. There first single Blueside is what the album is all about in a nut shell. Its a good song and it got me to grab the cd, only though I only heard the last 30 seconds of it on MTV. Don't get to excited though, they are still very raw. While I definately see some serious talent, I don't think this album will become quite as big as others might want it to be. There just seems to be something lacking in the way of movement and flow. Don't get me wrong, this band has definately gotten off on the right foot. I think they could have a nice future ahead of them."
4,A decent debut...,"I picked up this CD on a whim after seeing Rooney perform live (they're *excellent* live) and Im a bit dissapointed. While the CD is good, it makes them sound just like any other pop/rock act, and they have this great, raw energy live that's just not shown on here. Another thing is that it makes them sound identical to another favorite band of mine, Weezer. Live, they dont sound anything like Weezer. Their talent is incredibly raw, it needs some working around the edges, but all in all these boys are pretty talented."
5,hot guys equals hot tracks,"I thought this album was wicked. The songs were catchy but in a good way. The songs stayed in your head but not in the ""why is this song stuck in my head?!!"" kind of way. Each one had meaning to them which makes them become solid songs. This album was great I enjoyed the beats, especially on Popstar and Sorry Sorry and the lyrics were quite interesting. It's worth the money."
5,Amazing Album: Even Better In Concert,"This album is great, not only for emo fans, but for everyone. It combines the best of many generes. They sound something like a cross between the beatles, the oasis and the beach boys. I was excited when i saw their first video, ""Blueside"" on mtv. I was taken right there and went and bought the album later that day. Recently, i saw them in concert with damone. Although damone was terrible, they made Rooney look even better and they sounded out of this world. Their songs like ""Stay Away"" and ""Im a terrible Person"" make this album a must buy for all music lovers. Definately check out these guys because theyre goin' big real soon!"
2,no thank you...,"This CD almost put me to sleep... their music seems devoid of any true emotion or feel. It sounds more like a band which with help from the record company calculates its every move in order to sell more records (To the 16-year old teenage girl audience it seems). There are a couple moments where its OK, but besides that as a whole it's not worth your time or money. For a fix of melodic garagey-pop stuff go listen to the New Pornographers or the Shins instead of this drivel."
2,HORRIBLE cont. part 2,"I previously wrote a review for the Firefly. Just to clean things up a bit I'm going to correct it. Yes, I still think this phone is ridiculas- especially for 100 dollars. But after talking with my unfortunate 13 year old friend who had (his parents have now gotten him a normal cell phone)the Firefly, I've decided that this phone is alright for kids aged 7-11. Now parents, PLEASE, save your preteens and teens some angst- buy them a normal cell phone! I still think that younger kids could use a normal easy to use (such as the the Virgin Mobile K9 (25 bucks)) cell phone. But what ever- do what you want. But teens will not want this phone!"
1,a utter waste of time,"After all the wonderful reviews of this book, I could not wait to start reading. After reading the book, the only conclusion that can be made, is that the Aluets would rather stayed on their islands, and been killed by the Japanese. Yes, the conditions were not horrid, they were given substandard treatment in every regard. But, even bad conditions are better than being in the middle of a war, or from what this book, says, no."
4,Aes,"Skepticism plays ""funeral doom metal"" - slow, heavy, brooding. This is one 27-minute song, which I didn't realize when I bought it. However, it's a multi-part song and almost feels like a complete, but short, album. Skepticism seems to enjoy seeing just how slow they can play and still keep a beat, which they manage to do throughout. If you like to be able to understand lyrics, this probably isn't for you. The lyrics are a kind of low growling mumble, but they serve to set the mood, which is depressing, cold and bleak - like a Finnish winter night."
3,Panasonic Drill,Good general use drill. I do not use a drill often but this is better than most I have used. It does not come with drill 'accessories' and it really needs to be included. If it did I would rate this buy higher
2,Panasonic ABC'S,"First of all I use a cordless drill more than the average person, offen 5 days a week. A drill will usually last me 2-3 years. When I first bought this drill from my local wholesaler I was happy with my purchase, everything seemed to work well. After only 5 months this drill burned up on me, then I brought it back to the wholesale house, and they gladly shipped it to get it repaired. I got the drill back 6 weeks later (which I expected) put the battery into it only hummed, swapped batteries same reaction. so as of today may 8th 2006, I'm using my back up drill and will go out to buy a new drill. Thanks hope this review helps"
2,nice feel but...,"I'm a carpenter(almost 30 yrs) and I felt the need to add to my arsenal of drills(I have 3 Makitas, 1 Dewalt, 1 Bosch and 1 cheapo Sears). It got a good review in one of my trade mags and I liked the feel of it so I gave it a try. It was fine for small stuff, but I finally needed it for a big job--a 4"" dryer vent. It went through the soft wood shingles easily, and some of the plywood sheathing, then it started to smoke, sputter and finally die. I ended up finishing the hard part of the job(2 2x8 joists and part of the 4x6 sill with my ""lower-powered"" Dewalt which I didn't really like.I brought the drill back to Woodworkers Warehouse and found that it was 1 week past the replacement period, so it had to go out to warranty repair never-never land. Well, 6 weeks later it is still ""waiting for a motor from Panasonic"". Who knows?????So, the lesson to be learned here,If you decide to get this drill, is don't work it very hard and pray that it never breaks 'cuz you may never see it again."
5,Super Drill Driver,"Just ordered my second 15.6V cordless from Panasonic, My first I bought 5 years ago, and used it every day since doing cabinetry, kitchen installations. My original has lost a little of its sparkle the batteries really need replacing, so at this point its better to replace the drill! Looking forward to using the 3.5 amp/hour battery. I would agree the chuck on my drill is its weakest point, but this takes just a little patience to get used to, in all the best reasonably sized cordless on the market."
5,Well worth the money!,"I purchased this drill back in December 2004 and I am very pleased. I use it for various tasks associated with my work as well as home projects. The drill is relatively lightweight, yet still has excellent power and torque. It is very well balanced and feels good in your hand.The ratcheting chuck holds bits very secure. The NiMH batteries put NiCAD batteries to shame.I've used several other cordless drills over the years (Makita, Bosch, DeWalt) and this one beats them all. (Maybe some of the newer drills are better but I have no experience with them.)I have no complaints regarding this drill. It was money well spent."
4,Lightweight Powerhouse,"After reading the favorable review in Fine Homebuilding Magazine, I decided to give this tool a try. I am very impressed by its great ergonomic balance, its power, and the long run time from the batteries. I now use this drill exclusively for everyday drilling/driving tasks. When things get a little bit tougher (like somewhere between normal use and what one would expect from a Hole Hawg), I reach for my Makita 18 Volt drill (I guess I still can't shake my love of Makita). The only drawbacks are a ratcheting sound when loading the chuck and the ""Made in Mexico"" stamp (that is ONLY because I am a ""Made in USA"" snob!) For the average do-it-yourself-er or professional tradesman with medium to light heavy duty needs, this is a tool you may want to check out."
3,Warranty issues,"I bought this drill in June 08 and gave it limited use. I was boring through a 2x6 to run some electrical wire and the clutch broke. The spade bit was new and the wood soft, so I was surprised. I sent it out to be repaired and it has been over a month and the facility still doesn't have the replacement parts. Disappointing."
4,Slowly Breaking,"I will probably buy another one of these but my current one first lost its electric brake, then the chuck got broken bits of itself inside and now its smelling of burning electronics and works intermittently when I pull the trigger. I use this tool almost daily and it's given me about four years of service. The batteries are still strong. When I bought it I was hoping that I'd finally found a cordless that wasn't ""disposable."" Apparently, I was wrong. I love the relatively small size and the great feel and balance. Since I've got the two 15.6v batteries and a light I'm sort of stuck with this class of too. I plan on getting a cordless impact driver and I might get the 15.6v Panasonic even though I like the lightness of the 12v drivers."
2,Great tool in its time,"Have owned the Pany 15.6 1/2 DD for many years. Bought it shortly after it came on the market and it served well for several years. However, on visiting this site and reading some reviews giving it high praise, I found myself disagreeing. Not that it was not a great tool in its day, but in my tool box it has been replaced by an impact driver. A 14.4 impact driver, in my case a Makita, is just the tool of choice for high torque applications. It is far easier to use and 1.5 lbs lighter. For light duty jobs, the weight and bulk of the Pany works against it. This Pany only sees use on rare occassions now.For these reasons one needs to consider it in relation today's alternatives."
1,.,"started out great until the 3 men died then it got strange. It did revil the weak charachter of the singer from ""Texas"" and no woman in NY would have waited years for hime to ""come back to his sences""."
3,A breath of fresh dubby air,"A definite departure from Naked's standard fare (think of a grittier ""Bare Essentials""), the latest release is a breath of fresh dubby air. Many of the label's favorites such as Chicken Lips and Trentemoller appear a few times, but hey, who's complaining? With enough dirty disco and dub house to get you moving, ""Lost On Arrival"" certainly doesn't disappoint, yet it's far from forging any new territory as some other releases from NM have in the past. Regular fans won't be disappointed. As always, quality music from a quality label, albeit for the later night set."
1,Be aware!,"Unlike what's being illustrated on the photo, which is also on the label for the product package, the tabs for both the yellow folders and the green holders are on the RIGHT hand side instead of LEFT hand side as illustrated and as what they should be. This makes the product with only center tabs (purple and red) and tabs on the right hand side (the rest colors). We ordered three packages and they are all the same, which is really disappointing. We were looking forward to getting them so we can start reorganizing our files but now have to repack and take them back to the post office. Suggest Amazon discontinue carrying this product until the problem is corrected."
1,Don't fit squat,The length of zipper and the spacing of eyelets don't fit any of the boots I own. I doubt they'll fit yours either. Wish I'd not spent the money.
3,Does what I payed for,"I purchase the GI Military Jungle Boot Zipper Laces and when they came I was not excited about he fact that they are very shiney and a patent leather, but they have nice big easy to use zippers and most important to me they do not unzip throughout the day.The new GI do what they are supposed to do and quite nicely. I have owned several other brands and they all have small zippers that fail after a while and are hard to zip and unzip when the are warn in rough envirnonments, but unlike the GI the other brands are quite capable of unzipping themselves throughout the day. Hard to understand.SO, bottom line the GI's work."
2,DIDN'T WORK LIKE THE ONES I USED TO HAVE,"NOT THE SAME ITEM I WAS USED TO , HAD SOME IN VIETNAM AND LOVED THEM, THESE WERE NO WAY THE SAME QUALITY NOR THE SAME RESULTS IN THE BOOTS. WOULD NOT RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE.."
2,"So bad, yet I was entertained","The Spirit is full of bad acting and writing, but I have to admit that I was never bored. I just couldn't wait to see how this mess could get any worse. Believe it or not I didn't hate this movie nearly as much as I thought I would. The eye candy from all the beautiful ladies sure helped, but at least this flick didn't take itself too seriously (whoa Sam Jackson), like the even larger pile of garbage called Max Payne. On the plus side, the visuals while nothing new after Sin City, are quite good. Just sit back and prepare to have a ton of unintentional laughs. Good times."
4,Alison's review,"The price was good, excellent deliver service and the product arrived in great condition and is an hilariously funny DVD."
1,Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites,I gave this movie one star because i didn't like it. It did not have a lot of hauntings and it only talked about dead cleberties. and where you can see there grave site. it was a disappointment.
5,Perfect Bible,I absolutely love this Bible. The only I desire is that the print be a little larger and that it would have a Concordance. Other than that I think this is the perfect Bible
5,most overlooked band ever,"The band mind over four toured in a van throughout the u.s.a. for many years. I was priveleged enough to see them about 4 times. When I saw them they performed the material from this release. They were incredible live, the release is incredible as well, there were never more than 25 people at a show but the band played like they were on fire. They had a style all their own, the closest thing I have ever heard to them is at the drive in but that is only because of the ferocity of the two acts live show. This release showcases the diversity of styles the band was capable of, I am sure that it was recorded on a shoestring budget in a day or two, that's how they did it, they were very independent in approach and attitude. They never sold out. If you think a band would sound great if at the drive in merged with rage against the machine with king crimson with soundgarden, this might be a band for you."
1,NO CD included.,"I ordered this book, which clearly shows ""includes music CD/interactive CD-Rom"" in the description. When I received the order from wmboothsbookssf at Amazon Marketplace, there was no CD. I notified the seller immediately after opening the package writing them that there was no included CD. They said to send it back at my own expense (I had paid $3.99 for shipping) and they would refund the book minus a 15% restocking fee. So, I would have to go to the post office, pay to return it, then be refunded $3.86. I paid $$8.53 including shipping for a defective product, which I must return to even be refunded that amount. Now, I'm stuck with an unusable book. Thanks, Amazon."
4,"Great gloves, fit great - work great","So, I bought these gloves along with the rest of the SMX gear last year, and I've been down on them twice. both times the gloves protected my knuckles with the carbon fiber outer layer, and the leather as well. The gloves are comfortable, they move well, but here's my only two gripes.1. They're cold. Norcal has cold mornings, and cold evenings. My hands get very cold then. During they day they feel great.2. They only go to the wrist, so my new replacement pair on order come up over the wrist to protect them should I lay down again."
3,"Big Smoke, No Fire","Book after book, Richard Laymon's work rarely disappoints, even if each plot features a sadistic killer, a group of cannibals, and sex--LOTS of sex. However, Into the Fire falls short and rings absurd. The main characters adjust way too quickly to outrageous events, and the interior monologues, which Laymon usually utilizes to great effect, sound stilted and very unlike real thoughts. Also, Laymon introduces a minor female character that he quickly abandons; her presence in no way advances the plot.While the bus full of mannequins is a charming oddity and a creepy scene, and while the Mojave setting provides a stunning backdrop, Into the Fire smolders compared to Laymon's other efforts, producing big smoke but no fire."
1,Suck,These things suck and won't hold anything I used them to hold up a plastic Airsoft gun and the broke they don't hold any weight
2,"Decent, but don't trust it.",I use this carabiner when I hike to hang my bear bags. But 10-20 pounds is the extent to which I would trust it to hold.
3,Works,"But threads are coarse, and the hub freely rotates with any excessive movement, exposing the carabiner for easy opening and thus a safety issue, I'll reserve this one for my car keys."
3,Carabiner,"You get what you pay for. This works great for hanging bags while camping, or securing cargo. I definitely wouldn't trust it with my life. The locking collar appears to be more for looks than for actual safety. Not bad for the price as long as you know what your getting and what you're going to use it for."
4,works as intended,"After going to the beach one day and seeing a guy diving in the shallows looking for his lost car key, I knew I needed a locking carabiner for mine. So far it has done it's job and my key has stayed secure. It does feel a bit cheap and the locking part feels like it won't have a long life, but it is smaller than your average climbing biner which is a big plus when swimming with this thing clipped to your shorts.Update - It's been just over six months since writing this review and I am happily surprised this carabiner is still working like a charm. The spring mechanism on the latch has lost most of it's spring, but after countless hours in the ocean attached to a pair of shorts this is the only noticeable loss in quality. A good buy."
3,"Reasonable, I expected a little more heft ...","I am not sure what I was really expecting from this carabiner. I am using it to hold keys on my pants or bag during work. For that purpose, it should work well. I picked this particular option because it had the throat screw that allowed me to lock it.It's a very light aluminum (I'm guessing) and I am not sure how this will hold up to use. Hopefully a few years at least.The picture makes the carabiner look better than it feels. Not a lot of heft to it, it's very light. I'll report back with how it wears. I may be pleased about it's weight. I hope weight does not translate into ""cheap""."
2,This thing is a toy,"I knew it wasn't going to be ""The Real Thing,"" but for $5, I expected it to at least look like the real thing. This thing is small. A little smaller than those $1 carabiners you get at Walmart. Also, the ""lock"" jammed up every time I tried to use it. Granted, for what I wanted, it would have worked, (just for clipping stuff to my water bottle) but I want it to look like a real carabiner."
2,"Broken after two months, can't get open again","At first I was very happy with this. I had the problem of my keys sliding off my carabiner before, and thought this would be the solution. After two months, the screw piece that secures the carabiner is permanently shut. I can't seem to get it off. If I ever need to add more keys, or remove keys, I'll have to by all new rings cause I can't get mine off. I'm a little frustrated, and will look for a different product next time."
2,Quality does not justify cost,"At a bit over $4, I expected a much better build quality. You won't get that. This is the same quality as the ones they sell at the hardware store for 99 cents. It works to keep my keys together and yet provide a way to detach parts when necessary. At $1, I would give it a 5* rating. At $2, I would give it a 4* rating. At $4+, I give it 2*."
1,Elijah's misguided arrogance is disturbing,"Elijah Muhammed is both arrogant and gravely misinterpretting God's word. Muhammed was the final messanger of God, and Elijah is calling himself a messanger of God, so I would not hesitate to classify him as outside the Islamic Faith. God's servants must return to the pure teachings of the Qur'an."
2,Where's the collet nut?,"I am frustrated toc find, upon opening this rotary tool, that the collet nut does not fit the accessories, and therefore I had to go buy a new collet nut kit. Dremel, you just lost a customer."
1,"Dubbed, grainy version of film.",Should not be for sale. Embarrassing. Would not have bought it if I had known the quality of the item.
1,Love them instead,"The cover photo on this book says it all. How to take a tender baby and turn them into a sullen, angry, and non-communicating teenager. The Bible says to share the love of Jesus with the people around you, and I think it should include your children. What this book calls ""love"" is Pavlovian classical conditioning, or maybe simple child abuse. Look elsewhere if you want to raise a child who knows how to love. If all you want is for your child to follow your commands instantly when you are watching (but not when you are looking elsewhere), then this book may be for you."
5,great book,"I think this is a great book!! not only does it teach the gender roles that have we as a society placed on ourselfs many years ago, making this great to learn the way it was back then. It also really shows how we have not moved to far from it, people have the choice to do anything they want but the majority of the population is still following into the the same gender roles. i find it a great read very enjoyable, with a great laugh at the whole thing."
4,"Looks Beautiful, Though Instruction Manual is Terrible","The chest looks as in the picture and that is what I liked, though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this. My husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time, although it took him 5 hours to put together, he got through it fine. Instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room."
2,Condition,"I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true."
2,Not Satisfied,"I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend. However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces. I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue. The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks. With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for."
4,Okay..,"I like this product but it is not the best. The vegetables tend to be dry and it can be gritty if you do not stir it around. I am on a gluten free diet, so I guess I can't be too picky. I prefer the pad thai flavor (also, more filling) but I still order this for variety."
1,Yuck!,This soup tastes terrible and looks like hamster food mixed with water. I would never recommend this to anybody. I'm very disappointed.
2,Better in a format other than board book.,"This book is excellent--my 2.5 year old loves it. However, we chose to return the board book version and purchase the full-sized version because there is too much tiny text on each page for it to work well as a board book. It's not like other super-simple Eric Carle books that are our favorite board books (like Brown Bear, Brown Bear, for example). A great book, but not for babies. Buy the full-sized picture book version!"
4,Two Year Old Is Making Me Buy It,"We borrowed this book from the library and I have had to read it so many times to my 2 year old daughter that now I have to buy it! I don't know what it is about this book, but she carefully listens to each and every page. She was drawn in by the smiley faced pancake on the cover and asks to read it daily."
4,Great Book for the Beginning Sorcerer,"Although this was written for a young audience, this is a great book and an excellent resource for anyone. Mark Wilson makes magic fun to learn and perform. Yes, the book does offer some tricks that may be found on the backs of cereal boxes, but his cups and balls, Sympathetic Coins, Multiplying Billiard Balls and much more are classic effects that are carefully taught and very entertaining. Mr. Wilson simplifies some of the moves, but to a lay audience, the effects are still amazing. This book should be in every young magician's bookshelf."
3,they're all the same,"I feel the same way about all my magic books.Not particularly easy to read. All magic books are usually pretty obscure, for a reason: Magic doesn't really exist, and tricks are nothing more than obsuring the audiences perception. A good magician never learns from a book, they learn from another good magician. I don't know why I thought this would be different. It'll teach you concepts, but to truly pull these things off requires lots of practice."
1,In SERIOUS need of some FLAVOR,My oh my! What happened??? I expected so much better from Grandaddy. They've let me down this time! The best way I can describe the songs on their latest effort is LUKEWARM and BLAND.Boooorrrrriiiiiinnnngggg. . .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzWake me up when it's over. . .
3,Not so convenient on a Kindle,"I have a hardback copy of Rick Bayless's ""Mexico one plate at a time"". I enjoy reading about the recipies and I enjoy using the recipies. The Kindle version just seems klunky and I haven't used it to try and reproduce any of the recipies as yet. I like that the kindle version is a whole lot more portable. I usually transfer recipies to scrap paper for use in the kitchen so that I don't get my book all gunked up so it shouldn't be that big of a deal but the Kindle version is harder to search for what I am looking for."
4,Very Authentic,Great variety of recipes which seem quite authentic. Excellent christmas present which went down a treat. Thanks very much! Cheers.
4,Surprisingly good,"the characters and story line while being difficult were always deep and provocative. thought provoking, complex and shows the depth of love between brothers."
4,Underrated and that's a shame,"A steamy ""Southern Gothic"" film set in rural Florida in 1969, it passed through Chicago briefly in November (to rather mediocre reviews) reprized recently at the Gene Siskel Film Center here in Chicago, IMHO it definitely deserves the new attention as it has some of the best performances of 2012 (including those by Matthew McConaughey, Zach Efron, Nicole Kidman and John Cusack)."
4,It's a love story - albeit a disturbing one,"This movie is not for the faint of heart. There are some disturbing scenes, but the movie is well done and the character's love for his brother and the older woman are evident."
2,Boring,I can not really say anything good about this movie. It just drags on to a fairly obvious conclusion. Would not recommend wasting the time.
3,Tried Too Much,"I cannot recommend this movie as much as I would like to. The excellent performances could not make up for the script and the director's shortcomings.The Paperboy's failing was that it tried to be too many things. It reached for drama, noir, pulp, and exploitation and did none of them effectively.If you want to see great acting, period clothing, and little else, then this is your movie."
3,Kidman soars again,This movie is not for Disney fans.... That said... Kidman scores again for her portrayal and ability to become her character in a most convincing way!
1,Just plain BAD,"Disjointed, going nowhere, weak premise, bad acting, gratuitous sex, need I say more? I must say a decent job by Nicole Kidman. Haven't seen her like that in a long time but not worth the bucks to see it. And John Cusack creaped me out. In the end, what was the purpose of this movie? It certainly wasn't to entertain."
3,Interesting movie,"I expected more with the cast, but definitely worth a watch. Not for the prudish or faint of heart. I can't stress that point enough! Very good acting."
5,Awesome,The movie was greatit was fast and easy to do on my iPadthe cost was not bad really enjoyed it
2,Dire movie!,"It's saving grace was Nicole Kidman. That is her acting, the way she portrayed the dirt bag character. The movie never got going."
3,"Okay, held my interest","It was kind of a formula movie, but it was interesting with good characters and action scenes. Overall I liked it."
2,Great Acting - Sick Story,The acting in this story was so superb that you felt the essence of each character. The story itself is sickening.
1,Wish I had that 2 hours of my life back,"This movie was awful. You would think with an all star cast it would be good. The acting was all good, i will say that much but the movie was dark and hard to watch in parts. I can handle a lot but i'm sure to most people it would offensive. I can handle that usually. the plot jumped around, things were not explained. There was supposed symbolism that made no sense. And just when you wanted to see how it worked out at the end, the narrator just says this and that happened and it ends. Ridiculous. A total waste of time."
2,All Star Cast ...... But,"yes this has the all star cast. i bought this blu ray the day it first came out and it was only 14.95 for a new blu ray movie. most of the time they are 24.95 to 19.99. i know now why they took the 5.00 off. the movie just was bad. it is the kind of movie you get done with and never think of it again. cast was good, i wish i could tell you why it was bad but it was just dumb."
1,I'm being kind at one star,"So you figure Nicole Kidman and what-his-name Matthew McC would be the catalyst for a have-decent movie. So much for that line of thinking. This movie was a waste of time and money. It was so bad, the dog was bugging me to take her outside and I WAS GLAD! I am angry at myself for pissing away $4.99."
3,The Paperboy,"The film is not very well written, but seeing Nicole Kidman and the other actors playing such trashy characters is fun."
3,The Paperboy,"The the casting decisions in this movie were great and the actors were phenomenal in their roles. However, the movie was a bit more graphic that I anticipated even with the R rating. The movie had non-stop action and had some surprising twists. I would recommend it to others."
2,Did not like story at all,"A good cast, but terrible story. I could not sleep after watching it. It was disturbing in so many ways."
2,thank you,"I did not expect, I will install it myselfAnd I did not like the product at allProbably wrong of me because I have not read completely illustration"
5,Another Coen Brothers Triumph,"The only thing wrong with this movie was that the preview set one up to think it would be light comedy when, actually, it was dark comedy. I was prepared, from reviews, not to like this movie at all, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was as good as The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Okay, this is my opinion, but, what the heck, it's my review!!!"
3,Good silly movie,"Movie was fun to watch, if you like Cohen brothers, then you'll like this; it's not a ""smart"" movie -- IOW -- just sit back and watch it; don't expect much -- it's entertaining...."
3,Burn After Reading,"`Burn after Reading' is a quirky comedy/tragedy film from the Coen brothers that delivers plenty of laughs and comments at the absurdity of life. Following one woman's desire for cosmetic surgery and the twisted paths of Washington DC espionage that she becomes embroiled in as a result, this film offers plenty of plot twists. You get strong performances from all of the cast, with Clooney and Pitt being especially funny, Tilda Swinton as an ice cold bitch and Malkovic at his enraged and disgruntled best. The plot is a little convoluted and wonderfully absurd, but we've come to expect that from the Coen brothers and the direction is a flawless as ever. This is quite short at just over 90 minutes and you are kept engaged the whole way through. This isn't the most conventional or most hilarious comedy, but it is a unique piece of film making and worth a look if you've enjoyed past Coen films.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Burn After Watching,"I was rather distressed after watching this movie. The Cohen brothers usually make movies about pathological people where a lack of direct and open communication shines for its absence, something to be expected considering the soulless interaction of the characters. In this movie we see a Babylonian nightmare which includes the CIA, where intelligence also shines for its absence!So even though it was a truthful portrait of egotistical behavior and pathological behavior in our society, I don't think I'll be watching that movie again. But my compliments go to the Cohen brothers for pinning down the insanity that engulfs our society so well!"
3,"Great movie, but bad copy",The DVD froze and then skipped ahead toward the end of the movie. Paid a cent so I guess I can't complain too much.
2,Disappointing,"The cast is brilliant. Some of the humor works. However, the plot is depressing and nonsensical. It is hard to believe the stupidity of the characters at times. The direction seems crisp and well done. The violence is unexpected.All the characters seem to be in their own little hell of the own making and they are not bright enough to get out. The movie just seemed pointless to me and not that funny. Brad Pitt's character is very funny. Clooney, Swinton, and Malkovich all do a great job. I just didn't care after the first five minutes what happens to any of the characters. I kept thinking the movie would get better, but it never does. The movie seems well done, but the plot is pointless and pretty much humorless. The CIA briefings help draw out the humor, but it doesn't help enough."
3,Good Fun,"This is a fluffy piece from the Coen brothers, but it's still good fun. The cast is just great all around. McDormand and Pitt are riotous and sad idiots here. Clooney is off-the-map, Malkovich is Malkovich (gotta love him), Jenkins, Swinton, Simmons - all good. Light,and silly and of course bloody and deadly ultimately - but then again it's those fabulous brothers. Worth a spin or two."
1,Just Awful,"Don't waste your time or money. At the beginning I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. It was painful and tedious to watch. Brad and George should never have agreed to do this film, they both acted overly incompetent and ignorant. Just a lot of disjointed scenes with a few funny moments. ""Burn before watching!"""
1,Burn Before Seeing,"For a fan of the Cohen brothers, this movie was horribly disappointing. The best parts of the movie, sans one, were featured in the trailer. The characters, while interesting were two dimensional and began to grind on my nerves within ten minutes of their introduction. Towards the end of the movie, I ceased caring about the fates of any of the characters. Others likely will disagree, but the magic of Raising Arizona, Fargo or O Brother was missing from this film."
1,Dissapointing,"Sounded like a funny movie with dark comedy, but turned into a pointless plot with added violence. Mainly pretty depressing, pointless story. Most of the ""funny"" parts were more of ""hmm.. thats almost funny"", but even that is only about 3 spots in the movie.Sum of the story- guy gets laid off from CIA, everyone is sleeping with everyone behind everyone's back, and everyone gets killed except the lady who started everything.Sounded good with an ex CIA agent, everyone sleeping around, and famous actors, but nothing could make that plot into a good dark comedy"
2,More like BURN AFTER WATCHING!!,"I am a big fan of both George Clooney and Brad Pitt, but this movie definately does not show you what makes these actors great. The movie is honestly about NOTHING! It is a Spoof about the CIA, but that's about it. The only reason why I watched the whole movie is because I was curious and hoping that it would somehow get better (which it never did). If you like watching movies about nothing then this is the movie for you. But as for me I think I will BURN AFTER WATCHING."
1,Worst Movie I've Watchec in my LIFE,This was the worst movie I've ever watched in my life. A total waste of 2 hours of my time.
1,Burn after watching,I hate to say I bought this movie because of the actors in the movie. But the plot was terrible and It does show how women are so shallow about their looks. And I would say dont even waste your time or money on this DVD. And it is hard to disapoint me in a DVD but if I could I would ask for a refund on this movie it is the worst movie I have ever watched and it ended terrible.
2,Thoroughly shocked at lack of entertainment quality.,"I just totally expected more from this cast. My boyfriend and I usually love completely different kinds of movies (i.e. we basically never agree) and we both looked at each other about 20 minutes in, and we watched Zach and Miri Make a Porno instead. By the way, that was a great movie. My reasons for disliking: moved super slow, it's super stupid, it wasn't actually funny. Maybe I'm just not ""artsy"" enough for the independent film feel. But it just didn't cut it."
2,BURN B4 WaTcHiNg....ugh,"there is no way the Coen brothers had much of anything to do with this film...they must have been paid plenty to put their trademark ingenious plot rubber stamp because I KNOW they are much more intelligent than this film...Frances as always delivered the consumate performance and Brad was prolly the only interesting character as I spent my time determining his sexual inclination...wow, there's a thriller...duh...hate whoever was responsible for the gratuitous head shot tho, geez, he coulda had an extended hangover fer cryin out loud...sooo, in summary, HUGE COEN BROS FAN, what happened here??"
2,"I get it, I just didn't laugh","I get the subtleties, the cliches presented, it just wasn't funny. I find it unfortunate that this is the type of movie we're supposed to laugh at. Reminded me of Sideways, lots of critical acclaim, but a sad, mundane movie."
3,"Mildly Entertaining, Frustrating and Diffuse Rediculum","This movie depicts stupid people in stupid situations woven from their own misunderstood and terrible nature. I found this movie to be mildly entertaining as it follows multiple character plots that are strange enough to grab your attention, yet in the end squander it on dragged out scenes and lack of full development. The stupidity of some of the characters makes you hate them and others are made lovable. Bits and pieces of it were social commentary on every day pieces of life, yet when the pieces were put together, the picture wasn't quite on. It was a fair attempt at making a bizarre comedy with hints of social commentary in it, but lacked in momentum and delivery to fully win it.BOTTOM LINE: I don't recommend buying this movie, but perhaps maybe a RedBox.NOTE: If strong language bothers you, reconsider watching this one."
2,Disappointing,"Nope. It looks like they ran out of money before finishing this film, or just couldn't come up with a good ending. The thrust of the plot is a ripoff of CHU CHU AND THE PHILLY FLASH which starred Alan Arkin and Carol Burnett as a couple of bums who try to get a reward for returning some secret documents they found. Here it's a couple of gym employees trying to get a reward for some secrets on a computer disk they found. There are some parallel subplots about the owner of the disk, his wife's boyfriend, and some coincidental path-crossing, and some of it is funny; but not as funny as the old Alan Arkin film. However, I would have like it well enough until they failed to show the end of each of the parallel stories, instead having framing characters tell what happened."
2,Worst film in the Joel and Ethan Canon,"Appears to have been a filler film in between something great-previously (No Country) and something great-to-come. Tired, retreaded intersecting lives plot line guised as a black comedy. If you find yourself having to see it, get it on Netflix, otherwise pass on this dud. I am a Coen bros fan... don't flame me for sharing my opinion."
2,Whooo says?,Head doesn't turn as described in the wind- even fairly strong winds. And yes I did put the tab on it correctly.
5,"best baby ""manual"" on the market","...not that I am the ultimate expert, but I am a first-time mom of a six-week old son and have relied on this book. This is the best baby ""manual"" on the market. It is much more readable, realistic, accessible, and comprehensive than the traditional ""manual,"" What to Expect the First Year. Robin Barker does not have an agenda, nor does she preach.Barker writes in a clear and accessible way, and Baby Love is organized in a clear, usable way. Barker also has a good sense of humor (Chapters titles ""more about poo""), which makes reading Baby Love not only informative but engaging."
3,Somewhat Misses the Marx,"I have been a great fan of Groucho for almost forty years. I own every movie of his and with his brothers and numerous radio show recordings. There is no bad Groucho just as there is no bad Karloff. Their mere presence lifts even a ""C"" movie. Having stated that I was disappointed this video was simply outtakes from ""You Bet Your Life"". They are amusing and some even funny but I was expecting excerpts from various stages of his career. This was my assumption based on no info about the video at all. For the price it is okay and good if one doesn't know Groucho and the quality is very good for being lifted from 1950's tv."
5,Excellent Garden guide,"The first time I came across ""Perennials for Ohio"" was at the local branch of the Columbus Ohio library system shortly after relocating to the area. Finding this garden guide easy to use and extremely helpful, I decided to purchase two copies of the book, one for myself and one for a friend."
3,For Light-Duty Workouts or Kids,"I bought the Everlast 4852 Martial Arts Fitness Set (40 lb.) just to release some frustrations. I had taken Karate in the past and I figured that it could serve a future purpose if I wanted to go back into training. However, I have a really good punch (for a girl) and when I hit the bag, while it is tethered down, I smack it all over the place. We tightened the tether and have the bag hanging on the very first rung (where the 3 chains meet) and it's still too bouncy. I have got to get an 80 or 100 lb. bag.Bottomline, for light-duty workouts, kids or beginners, this is a good set, but not if you are really looking to punch something hard."
2,It was a little frustrating and boring.,I was looking forward to this movie so much and it was a good story but somewhere along the way something just did not work. It could have been so much better. ;-( I like to collect this type of movies but it would be painful to buy this one.
2,Still trying to figure this one out,"I read the comics back when they first came out. This is one of those cases when the original, in this case comic book is actually better than the screen adaptation."
1,Eye Candy was excellent,Seeing Eva in dishabille was great. Scarlett is always worth seeing.As for the movie... I have to say I did not enjoy it. Rent it if you must but I would say wait for cable if you have to see it.
1,Comic Book Graphics,"If you're a 12 to 14 yr. old male (well, maybe up to 15 if you have some social issues) then this parody of comic book action/graphics is going to satisfy all your cravings. For anyone else this self-indulgent cutesy artsy attempt to translate the static two-dimensional medium of comic book action/graphics into the living world of film is a waste. Couple that with senseless plot, robotic acting and boring monologues and you've created a wasteland."
2,Ed Wood came back to life or what?,This is one of the worst movie I saw in my all life! Frank Miller is the new Ed Wood. The only good thing in this movie is the special effect. The same visual style that we saw in Sin City.
1,A movie watch while drunk with friends,"This movie exemplifies the reasons why comic book movies had such a bad reputation for so long. I like Frank Miller. I think the Dark Knight was a seminal work in comic history, and the Sin City movie, while amazingly violent, was intense and well done.This movie was neither. It is not true to the source material, the characters do not make sense, and it is a horrible mishmash of the fifties and current culture. The actors should be ashamed they participated in this mess.However, if you want something to mock and deride with friends, this is the movie to see in a group. I would suggest while drunk, since I saw it sober which means I remember way to much detail, but the with friends part so have others to help you rip the plot, characters, and scenes to shreds is essential if you still have some insanely masochistic desire to watch this film."
4,what did i miss,"i don't get it, this movie was good, why did it not do beter? it was fun, plenty of action, humor, and lots of really beautiful women. if you like serious movies don't see it, if you like fun action movies, check it out."
1,"Wow!....Unbelievably bad!,","I really enjoyed ""Sin City"", so when I saw that this movie was also written and directed by Frank Miller, I was really looking forward to it.FORTUNATELY.......... I only rented it.I don't know whether they intentionally set out to produce a camp movie, but if that was their goal, they even failed at THAT. This thing's so bad it makes the 60s Batman TV show look like the apex of artistic achievement.The script was absolutely absurd. I kept thinking of ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""... a movie so bad it actually developed a cult following. This wreck was right in there: AWFUL dialogue; overblown and overwrought; so bad words fail me. They haven't invented adjectives to suit this disaster of a movie.And the ""acting""?........ Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! If you could call it that! A bunch of performers striking poses and mouthing words in absolutely the WORST kind of expository manneristic exhibitionism!Oh. My. God.Avoid this train wreck at all costs."
4,one of the more interesting superheroes,"and now for something different... interesting characters skillfully adapted. eternal struggle between good and evil... sometimes you root for one, sometimes the other!"
3,"Not exactly ""new""","Though this was advertised as ""New,"" the cartridge seems clearly remanufactured given the telltale hole in the plastic casing - hence the cheap price. Initial print quality seems ok, though I've had bad luck with reman's in the past. I'm hoping it will hold out, but not overly optimistic. On the bright side, this was only 1/3 the cost of an HP branded cartridge. May regret the decision, but Amazon should be more careful about misleading statements in product descriptions! Also, no easy recycling option."
4,Great Recipes,this is a great book! I have not tried all of the recipes yet but a lot of them and they are delicious! Can only recommend it!
5,This book made me a muffin baking addict!,"I had received another muffin cookbook as a gift several years ago and then decided to try this one. It has been a hit. Every recipe I've tried has been great (particularly the carrot muffins and the lemon muffins). I still have many recipes left to try, but they all sound good. I am rapidly becoming the ""Muffin Queen"" and am buying two more copies as Christmas gifts.I also recommend ""Muffins: Sixty Sweet and Savory Recipes"" by Elizabeth Alston."
4,Short read!,Not much to this book... maybe 20-25 recipes. It has a few that look tasty. I like the A to Z Bars book much better.
1,Poor quality,"We gave up buying cheap puzzles long ago. The extra cost of a quality puzzle is (usually) worth the extra cost. We will usually only purchase Springbok or Ravensburger. Well, our list just shrunk to Ravensburger only. This Springbok puzzle is a piece of junk. It is not cut through the entire bottom piece of card stock, so about every third piece had to be torn apart. This is aggravation enough, but the consequence is that the pieces don't fit together well. In fact, you wonder if every piece you fit together is actually the correct piece or not. It appears that the manufacturer has changed a process that has resulted in an inferior product. I will avoid all Springbok puzzles in the future."
3,Annick Goutal Eau d'Hadrien for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray,"I bought the same thing a year ago from Sak's Fifth Ave. Store in a 1.7 fl. oz, this is the one I love very much and somehow the one I bought from here has a slight different scent.The difference the Saks Fifth one smells more citrucy and very new, while the one from your provider smells a lot less citrucy and more soapy and powdery. I use both, but not the same time. The one from Sak's I use when I go to any special places, and the one from you, I use to go to church and other regular places. The coloring of the logo are different,too, the one from Sak's is of darker shadings and the one from your provider is the lighter coloring.Thanks,Thomas' Wife"
2,Not what I expected.,"I have a love/hate relationship with this perfume.I bought Eau D'Hadrien because off all the great reviews it has and because I love lemon.The inital application transports you to lemon heaven,ohh soo nice! But in about twenty minutes you're past the top and middle notes and the drydown begins.It turns into a musty musky cypresy mess that I very much dislike,with almost no hint of lemon:(Definitely try before you buy."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I can't tell you what a hard time I've had with Phonic. I purchased this model and it stopped working after 3 weeks. I had to send it back to phonic (at my cost) for a factory replacement which took FOREVER. Once I did receive it, it had serious problems interfacing to CuBase via Firefire... very flaky and it would blue screen the computer.I moved my DAW to Windows 7 as I use it for a number of music tasks and phonic doesn't support Windows 7. They kept telling me to check back to the website which I did for the last two months. They finally released the a large update of Windows 7 drivers but did not include one for this model. So if you get this you're stuck on XP forever.PHONIC is a joke of a company. You can count on cheap quality and a terrible customer service experience."
3,worth the money at 80 bucks,"yes they are heavy, well made, and are worth the 80 dollars, but they do need to be ironed after being washed and give an they have a heavy 'industrial' feeling to them, like sheets i remember long ago when in the hospital, they certainly are not smooth and luxurious as i had expected. we found no difference in the 'sleep feel' between these sheets and the 500 count ones at half the price. actually several sets of our older, less than 20 dollars, sheets we got from a deep discount store give more of that smooth lux-feel we had hoped for.the 3star rating is not due to quality of the product, but from dashed expectations; due to the disappoitment in not getting from these sheets that 'lux-sleep'feel' others have mentioned."
2,poor quality workmanship,This is the second set I have ordered the first was outstanding. The second set was received with one of the pillowcases not sewn for about 3 inches on one seam. I thought the workmanship and/or quality control left alot to be desired for such expensive linens.
4,Heavy Weight,I bought this sheet set based on reviews about a month ago. I am pleased so far. The depth of the bottom sheet even after three washings is more than adequate for our deep mattress. The Top sheet however seems a little short and certainly cannot be comfortably tucked in all the way around.The sheets are definitely heavy weights. The top sheet more than satisfies as a light blanket. I look forward to the set getting softer with age and washing.
3,Great quality although coarse texture,"These sheets are very good quality and fit well. They are much heavier than regular sheets. I was disappointed in the texture, which seems almost coarse. Not what I was expecting but still good sheets."
3,1000 tc sheets,"I have not bought the above sheets (my three is simply because amazon was follish enough to force a pick) but it is the nature of them to be ""hard"" at first.They are not at there best until 10 washings or so.They always will wrinkel but put them on my bed right out the wash."
3,"Very nice, but major shrinkage!",I received these sheets and immediately placed them on my bed. They fit very nicely with room to spare at first but after the initial wash they shrunk. They barely fit my mattresses now.
1,Fabulous until 3rd wash,"These were SO wonderful at first....soft & thick, very cozy ~ but after the 3rd washing, pill balls EVERYWHERE! Our sheets felt like fine-grained sandpaper! We have a HE washer that doesn't twist the sheets (which supposedly causes pillballs) but we ended up having them anyways. If I can find the packing label I'm sending them back for a refund. Pity, it was such a great deal. :o("
1,NOT THE CORRECT COLOR!!,"The blue cross is not correct at all. It looks like a baby blue or a sky blue. Not a Finnish Flag. Please choose a different company to order a Finnish flag. This was severely disappointing. I now must give it to a thrift store or store it in my closet, lest I want to shamefully represent Finland :["
3,"Functional, but bulky and a bit tempermental","I purchased this heart monitor for myself - figuring I could get a more accurate feedback during workouts. It works as described, but I find the watch itself to be extremely bulky for my wrist. I do have a tiny wrist, but I find this to be excessively large. Looks aren't everything, but I am very aware of it on my arm. The heart monitor band seems sturdy, but once you get it all sweaty it tends to slide around. It also does not adjust much - and although it fits me just fine, I think if I were someone of a larger size it might be very uncomfortable.It seems to keep reasonably accurate data, although I think the calorie count might be slightly inflated. However, it sometimes just stops picking up my heartbeat - this happens at least once every time I use it. It eventually picks it back up, but I find this annoying.Overall a good product but I had to deduct for bulkiness and its occasional spotty reception from the wireless band."
3,Good for moderate use,"I bought this monitor a year ago. It is a good monitor and does a good job reading my heart rate. The extra features on the watch are nice as well. The only complaint I have is that the plastic latch that hold the elastic piece to the monitor strap you see here cracked and broke early on. I used it nearly every day for a month before it happened. I've made do with a little velcro loop, but expected the original product's system to last longer."
3,Perhaps showing its age?,"This book is ten years old. At the time of its publication, it may have seemed more relevant than it struck me as I read it for the first time. Literally, the book is about the unintended consequences of technology. Invent a mass producible automobile and, as one result, thousands die every year in traffic accidents.Likewise the now ubiquitous mouse that made the computer so accessible has also become a public health hazard owing to carpal tunnel syndrome.In short, no matter how clever the technology, no matter how beneficial, you can make there's a ""gotcha"" somewhere down the road.The truth of the tale is easily seen and Tenner writes well.It's just that ten years after publication, it all seems so obvious.Jerry"
3,Action and Reaction Again and Again,"This book is slightly mistitled; it probably should have been called ""HOW Things Bite Back"", since there's not a lot of ""why"" until the last few pages of the book. Tenner provides many discrete examples of how various technological solutions to problems of the past have resulted in unforseen consequences, but never really gets at the heart of the philosophical question of why there must always be such unintended consequences. Despite this, it's a fairly interesting little look at various disasters, big and small. Surprisingly, for someone who's not a sports fanatic, the foray into how technology has changed sports in unexpected ways turned out to be the most interesting section."
5,Why did Air France Flight 358 crash ?,"The ultimate root cause of the crash was the pilots choosing to land in the middle of an intense thunderstorm due to their fancy A340. This book includes a nice collection of case histories on this ""Generalized Utterly Dismal Theorem"" - that technical safety-margins must disappear because folks eventually push any limits.More recently, the Google query (( coral destruction tires )) demonstrates what once seemed like a brilliant concept just did not work out that way. The book is filled with a surprising abundance of examples of these ""looks fine on paper"" disasters."
5,Great Reference,"I've just started experimenting with drawing and I find myself turning to this book every time I get my pencils out. This book has twelve personalities and characteristics for female manga characters. I find it a very useful resource and didn't expect to see step-by-step instructions as that was not mentioned anywhere and I have other books for learning the basics of drawing. If I have trouble duplicating something I just grab some tracing paper and play around with it until I figure it out.There are a couple of shots with breasts but they aren't offensive or anything, just outline sketches so you know where everything is and can dress them appropriately. I figure if you don't want to see them you should probably stick with drawing male characters since they're inevitable with females. All-in-all, as a newbie, I found it to be a terrific help with creating my characters."
1,a little cliche,"I'm a college student. We hear this stuff all the time. There is really very little in the way of ""new"" messages that you will take away from this."
4,great for a history buff,I learned much just by reading this book. The author did great research to get these quotes. It really shows the reader the true side of Stonewall.
3,Get the supplements!,"For the love of gawd, get the supplements!!!There is a workbook...get it.There are CDs...get them.You will need (and probably be required) to get both.Make sure they are both 7th edition.On the + side, you will likely use this book for French 1, French 2, French 3, and French 4. (take good care of the book and materials is my suggestion).Another note: For my French class, the CDs are loaded in the language lab's system. I did not ""have"" to buy them, but I find the additional practice at home helps."
2,Not the best,"Movements are gentle, but this is not the best quality DVD. Instructor is loud and abrasive which, for me anyway, doesn't lead to an effective tai chi workout. Tai chi is supposed to be slow and deliberate, she moves to fast and is kind of sloppy in her technique. Absolute beginners will probably find this ok but anyone who's done tai chi before probably won't like it."
1,Gail Tsukiyama's Dreaming Water,"Having read and loved all of her other books, I was very disappointed in this one. Having no beginning and no end, it just plods along from chapter to chapter, each one in the voice of a different character. The story doesn't progress and at times I found myself vacillating between pity and contempt for some of the characters. At the end there is more movement and I finally became involved with the characters only to be left hanging in the air. I turned the page and the book was finished.I really hate to say this, but maybe Ms Tsukiyama should stick to writing about Asians. One of my favorite authors, Pearl Buck, wrote so beautifully about China, but I never thought she wrote well about Occidental people at all."
2,Dreaming Water,"Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure. I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be. I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story. I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden! So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end. I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing."
1,Dreaming Water - More Like A Nightmare,"Having read all of Gail Tsukiyama's other books, and loving them, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Dreaming Water. It was a huge disappointment, a simply depressing story, with no imagination. To keep to her beautiful story telling, I think Ms. Tsukiyama should stick to the asian background of her previous novels."
3,Introducing Edwin Luke,"THE JADE MASK is a fairly good Chan film with a plot about a diabolical genius who is trying to interrupt the Amarican war effort through a series of murders, including that of a key scientist.Chan is played by Sidney Toler and he is joined by Edwin Luke as Eddie Chan, the number three son.The cast also includes the talented comic Manton Moreland as well as Janet Warren and Edith Evanson.The movie was produced by James S. Burkett and directed by Phil Rosen. George Callahan wrote the screenplay."
1,serious misrepresentation ~ ripoff extraordinaire,"I bought this book at the same time as I bought the first three ""Sir Sidney Smith"" books in the series.After finishing the third book in the series, I picked up this novel.I was, and still am, furious that I spent over $20 (including s&h;) for a book that is word for word (excepting the first three or four pages) the same book as the first book in the series of books about Sir Sidney Smith.It is disingenuous at best, to offer these two books on the same site at the same time, without a notice spelling out that they are the same story with a different title.If there is a way to get my money back I would like to get it back without delay."
3,Needed editing,A good story but needed some editing...has long dry passages that don't seem to add much to the story. Overall a very gothic feeling to the book...Peake does a great job portraying a very melancholy world filled with dark obsessive characters. Entertaining and thought provoking but certainly not a book that has an epic story or very driven plot.
4,Great story. Great pictures.,This is such a cute story. The illustrations are beautiful. It's a Christmas classic in our family! Must buy Christmas book!!
2,This is an abridged board book,"We love the book ""The Mitten"" that we checked out from the library. Beware that this version of the book is abridged and in board book format. The full text book and illustrations are much better."
2,Good but short lived,"My wife and I bought two Oster 2609 hand blenders for making shakes as part of a diet program. Initially they worked great. The bottom can be removed and rinsed but deep cleaning is difficult. The blender has the tendancy to go into hydraulic oscillation and make a mess. The tabs on one motor broke after ~6 months so the blender base will not stay on, meaning blending is a two handed job. The bearings in the base are getting tight and I don't think will last much longer. I am disappointed."
2,Dissertation not publication for public,It seems to be an English version of translation from foreign language without fully understanding original contents. Not recommended. a
5,Amazing Book......Amazing Physician,"I was a patient of Dr. Karl's back in April 2002. I was in my mid 30's and of course scared to death of surgery. Dr. Karl was the 4th surgeon that I had consulted. Once I met him, I knew he was the surgeon for me. His understanding of what I was going through, his grace, his medical experience. I could go on and on.When I heard he had written a book, I had to read it. As a patient of Dr. Karl's, when I was reading his book, I felt he was writing from his heart. There was no fluff in this book. Dr. Karl is a wonderful man, surgeon, person and spirit. I am sure Dr. Karl has touch so many people's lives. This book is a must read for patients and surgeons!Tammy (Brock) Cartiglia"
5,Book was very entertaining and informative,"This trivia book is a must for all lovers of Soul/R&B music. My friends and I have had a ball trying to answer the questions in all the various decades. It is a must for a party, great way to get everyone invovled in a fun journey through the music."
3,A little too hard -- scratches the scalp,"I remember using something like these back in the 1970's (I even had one on the end of a hose that would squirt water. You would use that one after a shampoo and not during) and I remember liking them, so when I came across it on Amazon, I had to order one. Problem is, this one is made of hard plastic and using it feels like scraping my head with a comb. The little spikes could stand to be a bit more pliable and a little less abrasive on the scalp. I'm still enjoying it, and I use it every time I wash my hair--albeit very lightly. It really massages the scalp, but when I rinse afterwards I get a bit of a burn where the water hits all the little scratches in my scalp."
3,Don't Be Fooled,"It may be 99 cents, but the only option for shipping for me was like 7-8 bucks. There's not really anything wrong with the product, though."
5,Initial entry,"There are a huge number of books on trout fishing, Dave Hughes' three: Tactics, Handbook of Hatches, and Reading Water form a comprehensive core that give a solid background on all the basics. Read all three, do what he recommends for development, and you will be well down the road to competence.When I teach newbies, I give them copies of all three, make them read them before I put tackle in their hands or take them to water, and everyone does FAR better than the traditional approach that puts a rod in their hand but no clue in their brain."
2,elementary and too wordy,"This book contains some decent information, but is generally very elementary. It frequently states the obvious. If you've never seen a river, it might be useful. The valuable information really should and could be condensed into a booklet of one quarter this size."
3,Not What I Remember..,"A bit heavy, good for keeping in the car if you are in and out. That's it. Nothing to write home about."
2,"Good basic text, but dated material","I've used Simpson to teach PLC basic at a community college in Vancouver, WA. It is a good solid text that covers much of the basics of PLCs and PLC applications. The book does not focus on one PLC brand, but uses programming examples from Modicon, Allen-Bradley and Texas Instruments controllers. Simpson has some good programming examples, but could use more.There are two issues I have with the text. The most important is that the information is dated. For example the Allen-Bradey information is all relevant to the PLC-2, a product that was obsoleted not long after the publication date, if not before. (Very confusing for my students who are trying to learn AB SLC-500 addressing which is completely different.) Second, there is very little about I/O types (AC, DC, triac, FET, etc.) and some of the important characteristics of each. If this book were revised with an eye to current industry practices, I would give it a much stronger recomendation."
2,Why does she bother?,"I loved Bertrice Small's books. And I keep on buying them hoping that she will get back to writing. This book, and others that she has written lately, is more like copy what she has done before, paraphrase, and ship it out.I think many buyers are like me. They want the old Bertrice back and keep on buying her books hoping that this one is it! Unfortunately, this book is boring. I didn't even finish it."
1,This was awful!!!,"I was so disappointed -- I know I have read other things by Bertrice Small that I liked. By the end of the first novella I was feeling like I was reading someone's first attempt at writing a romance. No character development, extremely stiff dialogue, and some odd forays into vulgar references here and there that seemed completely out of place. At times I felt like I was reading bad porn. Very immature writing."
2,What could have been,"As I've said before, I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan.I own both books these movies are from, annnnnd. I really wanted to like this, I really did. Buuut alas, I couldn't. i felt like I was being lectured on shipwreck diving, and how to preserve shipwrecks. Instead of exploring the wrecks, I give it two stars. The books are much more exciting"
1,Another disappointment from Amazon's Reviews,"Yet again I have fallen prey to the brilliant rating given a book only to read it and be utterly disappointed! Jonathan Stone would do well to do more research and less cutsy, quasi mystery writing. In the Heat of Lies, the mistakes of The Cold Truth are only magnified with little character development beyond the paper thin characters of the first book in this hopefully two book series! Palmer continues as a completely unprepared detective, completely out of her depth attempting to solve what is really a tissue thin mystery. It's all down hill from there. Forget this book!"
3,GAME DOES NOT SAVE,"Our sons loved the game; however, it does not save. We have had this same issue with a couple other PSP games (spiderman 3, MX vs ATV)."
2,"Good pictures, Terrible text!","If you're a good Democrat and despise the Republican Party, then this book will re-enforce most of your prejudies. Through-out his book, Evens makes snide remarks about Nixion and Regean. If your looking for an objective book on the 20th Century, maybe you should look someplace else."
4,Compelling...but disturbing,"Nature versus nurture--the age-old debate. This book takes a look at how both determine the way children grow up, and whether they are predestined to grow up violent. Each stage of development--pre- and post-natal--is explored. A fascinating study.Another recent title I've read: Miss America By Day by Marilyn VanDerber. Also highly recommended."
5,Should be required reading for all child-bearing age adults.,This book makes a compelling case for nurturance and protection of pregnant mothers and their young children. It's wonderful to imagine a society that offered its finest resources to them.
4,"Good Picture, Bad Sound","I'd thought other reviewers were just being a little picky with the sound issues, but I've got to admit they were right. I do recall the first time I turned it on and thought it sounded like a transistor radio. The quality is okay if you turn the bass all the way up. For us, it's just a bedroom TV so sound quality isn't a must-have. But for a bedroom TV, it is a shame the volume doesn't go any lower. Even when my wife and I are both awake and watching TV, the volume needs be no louder then its lowest volume level. And even at that volume I can understand every word from down the hall with both doors closed. It's really strange to me that this was the lowest volume they could engineer. As for picture quality, it's perfectly acceptable from across the room using NTSC input from my DirecTV receiver. Haven't tried it yet with HDTV, but I gather from all the reviews that the HDTV quality would be excellent."
5,Gene Roddenberry's Earth Final Conflict - Season 1,"It was nice to finally have season 1 of Earth Final Conflict available on DVD. In my oppinion it is the best non Star Trek Gene Roddenberry created series. I have had season 3 and 4 for years but unless you have season 1 and 2 you're at a lost. It has a story ark that begins in season 1 and plays into season 2,3,4,5. So hopefully season 2 will be available on DVD soon so I can watch it as it is, a five year story."
5,Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict - Season 1,"I Am so over joyed that after years, Season one Of E:FC Has Come out.the cool thing was is that After pre-ordering it for free via A gift card waiting another 2 month I finally received it on the Same Day as the New Star Trek Movie came out. Now how is that for timing. As you can see, Season 3,4, and 5 have been out for a whole and Is getting harder come by,So here is your chance to get clout up with this Awesome! Series. Season One was every thing I remembered it. This is because of the licensing in that Season 1 and 2 are owned by universal and 3,4, and 5 are owned by ADV films.Looking at the later seasons I sometimes wander why they killed of the original main actor ""BOONE"". All there is lift now is For Season 2 to come out. I will be just a eager to fill that big gape. This Series was A head if its time filled with great story are, lots of action and over flowing plots. A great show as all Gene's creations are.Gustav"
3,I bought this for my husband,"I'm not the biggest science fiction fan anyway, but if it's done well, then I enjoy it like anything else. I found this series to be a bit contrived but really pretty to watch. Perhaps I'm not the best person to ask to review science fiction."
5,earth final sereies 1,taelonns attackingand kKinkaid there to save the world.. this Cosmo-Sexual romp in the save earth genre is hotand fun KINKAID the protector is a multi specied hunk. The COSMOS.
5,Definitely an investment!!!,"i'm a workout fanatic. i'm at the gym 4-5 times a week. i do everything from runnning a 5k outdoors, spinning, bodypump, circuit training...so i guess you could say i have endurance and strength. HOWEVER! this workout totally has me falling over in pain---oh it burns!! sylvia does so many reps with little breather between moves that i'm literally cringing in agony while drenched in sweat. better believe she makes you work your tush off! her moves are straight to the point and very effective. i was looking for a workout to do at home that concentrates on inner thighs (my trouble spot) and i'm glad i bought this because sylvia totally hits the spot! i just started working out with this dvd but i have no doubt that i will have a more firm lower body in no time at all! definitely a great purchase!!!"
2,"After a slow start, this 2nd Monogram has action ending.","For some reason, the second Monogram Chan movie is a bit slow moving during the first half of the film. Mantan Moreland's comedy material is not very good this time, but would improve in The Scarlet Clue and The Shanghai Cobra. Chan and Number 3 son Tommy get captured and roughed up this time, unusual in a Chan film. I would call this a middling effort from Monogram. Classic Chan line is ""Expert is merely man who make quick decision--and is sometimes right."""
3,The Monogram Chan's are Fun TOO!,"I realize that the budget for the Charlie Chan Films was considerably streamed down when they were produced through the poverty row studio, Monogram. None the less, they are still fun to watch. And if you are a completest of the Chan movies like I am; a must have on your shelf."
3,It was ok...... just ok,"Let me first say that I have watched the Southern Cross series on the old Harmony Gold VHS tapes, and liked it better. The only real improvement over the old VHS tapes is the picture and sound quality. The only new footage in the set is Dana in the shower - three times, and an up the dress shot when she is climbing. In the old VHS series, they did not have the episodes cut with introduction credit and comercial insert clips. I could live with these if I thought it improved the enjoyablity of the film experience,it dosen't. My advice is go with the old VHS tapes, the film is not cut and it does not have all the ""extras"" that are totally worthless in terms of story line."
5,"Learnig by music, a great method.","I've had two years of college Spanish and additional courses on Advanced Spanish. For me, reading, writing, and speaking came much easier than audibly understanding the language. Stacey's combination of books and CD's shows that music is a very effective way of learning the vocabulary, grammar, and audibly recognizing words all at the same time. I wish I had her program a long time ago.Excellent job Stacey."
4,Great for on the road,"Provides a great way to learn spanish on the road. The traditional songs are made more up beat encouraging you to sing a long, helping you to learn the language. The kids also like the part where it teaches the spanish alphabets. I still feel the needs to supplement with a flash card review and/or workbook."
3,interesting bag,"I like the bag but there are several things that annoy me for this laptop. First, it is a bit wide. Second, I have no use for the metallic foil section that it used ""I think"" to keep food warm. I did have some problem with airport security because of this foil compartment. It is reasonably priced and quite tough."
5,Mixed Train Daily purchased from Amazon,"I first came across the book ""Mixed Train Daily"" in my high school library in 1947. The book was written by railfan and bon vivant Lucius Beebe, with photos by Charles Clegg. I purchased and still have a second edition. A historical society has been formed locally to preserve the history of a relatively small and unpretentious local railroad, the Unadilla Valley RR. Knowing that this was one of the rail lines written about and photographed in the book, and discovering that the book was unfamiliar to the society, I thought it would be a nice gesture to obtain and donate a copy in good condition to the group. That was my motivation in ordering a copy from Amazon. I was pleased to find a copy listed in fine shape, and to receive the book very quickly and in like new condition. I am sure the historical society will be equally pleased when I deliver it to them."
1,Nothing like the picture,"I was so excited to receive this, but after it came in, I was very disappointed. It came in a clear plastic bag and the dog was all mangled. I opened it up and the hair was not soft. It was somewhat curly and there is no way it looked like the picture shown. It looked used and old and like a dog you find on the streets. I'm not sure what happened, but I am returning it."
1,Ear tint is blue!!!,We received this dog as a gift and the ear tint came in blue instead of grey as picture indicates!
1,More like a mutt,"Sorry, but this puppy isn't really as cute as shown in the photo. It's more like a mutt with curly hair. I didn't find it adorable at all. Returning it."
5,Captivated,"I finished reading your poignant book on a plane. I was captivated reading your wonderful pictures. I was able to walk with you and feel the lusciousness of the garden experience while you so brilliantly wove common sense life skills and motivations throughout. I've had fun sharing the book with a good number of people so far, from friends to plane seat-mates."
5,Riley Goes Hard,"I don't wanna be d*ck-riding or nothin, but this is one of the best episodes I've seen. It's got a lot of great pop culture references. They reenacted the Wu-Tang ""Skinny-looking, big-head"" skit, a lot of Scarface, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite. It's narrated by Riley in a Goodfellas/Casino style. The climax of the show is hilarious! Riley goes EXTRA hard and recites the funniest monologue he's ever said. The plot is well thought out. The rise and fall of Riley's candy empire is a great storyline. If you only buy one episode of this show, make it this one."
3,Kinda girlie looking...,"My cat needed a waterer, especially cause she kept tipping over/playing in her water bowl. She never spills water/plays with her water with this waterer. I like this unit, cause all I need to do is drain water out of it every 5 days or so. She'll drop her food in her water, leave it there, and her water will get all 'yucky'.In addition, since I filled the item when I got it several weeks ago, I haven't had to re-fill it. So convenient!"
2,Tips over way too easily,"My cats are still young and playful, but I wanted to get them a waterer that they couldn't tip over. And preferably one that wasn't really loud and 50 bucks. But I guess I'll spend that money now. The top part hardly connects to the bottom at all. There's no clicking mechanism; it just balances there. And because of its top-heavy shape, you barely have to nudge it for the whole upper half to flip over.So I'm throwing this out after wiping up water all over the kitchen floor for the zillionth time. grr."
4,Great Product,"This item arrived quicker than expected, which is always good. Very bouncy at first but it gets better like normal play."
1,A Problem with the Truth?,"The author tells the story of how he ordered the Charles Atlas Weightlifting program and started lifting homemade weights. This story cannot be true. Charles Atlas did not have a weightlifting program. The Atlas course is totally devoted to bodyweight exercises called Dynamic Tension and Atlas was very clear that in his methods you did not need any apparatus whatsoever. Anyone who ever really took the Charles Atlas program would know this. I didn't read beyond this section, because I knew he was lying and so I didn't trust anything else he had to say."
3,Super Dome Squirrel Baffle,"After years of battling squirrels and after trying numerous other baffles I findly decided to break down and by this item. I live in northern WI and I am only guessing that the squirrels could be larger here than other areas of the country. The first day I hung it outside my window I watched a squirrel scurry down a tree branch down the short length of wire and on to the dome which he promptly slid off of. This was a thrill to watch and I thought the problem was resolved, this lasted until the next attempt where he was able to keep a toe hold on the wire above and reach around to grab the wire holding the feeder on the bottom. I do feel with some feeder support position adjustments this maybe prevented in the future but it is not the turnkey solution which you might expect at the price they are asking. It is a heavier gauge clear plastic and looks better than a garbage can lid hanging from your tree but does require some tweaking."
3,Good book after Schneier's Non-Mathematical Treatment,"If you are an engineer trying to learn crypto, maybe get a book on number theory to go with this book. It'd be nice if there were fewer errors and more worked out problems, as well.Overall a good effort but written by a mathematican so you need a book like Schenier's that explains how to use the tools. Maybe Scheier is the one I'd read first. Then read Stinson's to understand how the tools work because Scheier's book is mathematically barren."
4,Hawksong,"Danica was one of my favorite characters. She has to give up something to be able to have peace, but I'm not going to tell you what. This is a very good book with some adventure and a war. I can't wait for the second book Snakecharm. I hope that this author will write many more books than just these two."
3,Enjoyable light reading,"Every once in a while you I need something short and sweet. Not too much thinking, just sitting down and enjoying an interesting story with a happy ending. That was Hawksong for me. It was really written, the world was fully realized, and the characters were believable. There is sadness and betrayal, but there is a happy ending. Zane was very interesting as a character, and more likable than our Hawk main character. I can't give this any higher of a rating than 3 though because it could have been much more. Everything happened quickly and predictably. In the YA genre I don't mind that at all, but it's nothing extraordinary. I would suggest this book to YA fantasy fans, or for anyone looking for a light and fun read."
5,Perfect!,Ernest and his author are favorites at out house! He and his friends are great story tellers and bring up good things to share with my grandkids. Our thanks to Laura Barnes for her super stories and pictures!
4,Efficient,The product arrived to destination quickly and the product sufficiently met the needs that were expected.
4,Not for all uses...,"I originally purchased this mouse for use with AutoCAD. I found that trying to navigate through a drawing with a conventional mouse was too constricting (cord's either too short or pad not big enough!). Unfortunately, this mouse lacks the precision that a conventional one has (trying to manipulate a cursor with the thumb in such a case is very frustrating). However, if used for all other computer applications (such as navigating this site), Logitech's trackball shines wonderfully!PS: The scroll wheel is overly ""ratchety"" and the right button is too often accidentally clicked."
5,Excellent Trackball (trackballs rock in general),"I have the version of this mouse without the wheel (Trackman Marble) and am planning on ordering the wheel version. If you've never used a trackball, give it a shot.. it's amazing how much of a differance it really does make, once you get used to it.I had a non-optical trackball before this and loved it as well, although it took a good week to get used to it in the beginning.This perticular model requires little cleaning and what cleaning it does require has nothing to do with accuracy - the points the ball is suspended on get a little dirty, so you just pop the ball out once a week and run a fingertip across the points to get the dust and dirt off, works great and takes about 20 seconds total, no tools required.Hope this helps someone decide on it.. me, I'm off to buy the wheel version :)"
4,NOT for gamers,"I just purchased this today and it is the smoothest mouse i've ever had. The thumb marble takes some getting used to but i think it is better than a traditional marble mouse.However let me point out this, you will get fragged over and over in games like Unreal Tournament and Q3. You can move around the hallways better but forget about aiming even at slow speeds. Even with the sensitivity turned down on the mouse and the game i still couldn't lock on to a target very well.Overall great for everything but games!"
5,Alzheimer's Caregivers Get This.,The shipper was great. Package arrived in perfect condition and very prompt delivery. If you care for a person with Alzheimer's .... this is a must. It can really help you get through some rough times.
1,Didnt work,This product did not work. I have 2 I would like to return but don't know where to send them and how the return process works. One of them I didn't even take out of the box and the other is wrapped back up in its original packaging. Please let me know where they need to be sent back to and how I get a refund. Thank you.
5,Finally it worked!,This 2GB card does not work for Motorola V3m V3i. The company was willing to work with me to meet my need. They agreed to exchange this card to a 1 GB card which works very well and refunded me the difference. I am very happy with their flexibility.
2,Palm TREO 755p Unable to Format,"First I recieved 2 micro SD Cards and a standard SD adapter. I had purchased the retail kit that should have had the mini adapter which was sent several weeks later after I had notified them of the error. The memory will not work in my Palm Treo 755p even though it is the recommended type standard SD Mini. I don't know if it is the memory or the phone. It does see the card and asks to format it, then I get an error that this media can not be formatted. OH well."
1,Superficial,"I attended the Kalachakra Spiti 2000. This CD room just shows the very superficial part of the ritual, without giving real importance to the key parts of it. It shows the Kalachakra ritual from the perspective of a foreign touristy eye with no deep understanding of the Tibetan culture, religion etc. Even the way the photos were shown is too busy and we can hardly see the quality of the professional photos. For those interested in adventure and exotic rituals this is a good stereotype. As a final comment the ritual finished when the monks poured the sand of the Kalachakra at the lake nearby, SO even the coverage of the event was not done until the end. I know the theme is complex and that is why there is so much misunderstanding about it specially in the west, but this CD ROM DOES NOT MAKE JUSTICE OF THE BEAUTY OF THE KALACHAKRA INITIATION, TEACHING AND MANDALA."
2,A REAL LET-DOWN,"In my opinion,this is one of the worst books written about Marilyn Monroe.Perhaps it was a novelty back in 1987 when it was first published,but certainly it has not stood the test of time.Author Shevey,a feminist,does not disclose anything new about the actress and does not really seem committed.Besides,the book contains blatant mistakes,both factual and chronological."
4,Dieter & Herzog Will Capture & Keep Your Attention,"Very compelling story and moving re-enactment of a grueling, death-defying prisoner of war escape by an amazing human being, Dieter Dengler. While I had not heard of Dengler before watching this film, I've read several first-hand prisoner-of-war accounts from the Vietnam War and found Herzog's documentary not only intriguing but revealing of the man who went through those horrible experiences. That was a unique dimension that heightened my interest in the film and my appreciation of Herzog as a director.This is the first of Herzog's films/documentaries that I had seen, and it whetted my appetite for more of his work. I think it's much better than Rescue Dawn, starring Christian Bale although I enjoyed that one too.LITTLE DIETER is fascinating from start to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone who's a Herzog fan but hasn't seen this film yet AND to those who are interested in military affairs, especially those during the Vietnam War."
4,Good documentary,"Interesting man, interesting life, well told story. Although, I'm sure dramatic flair was added to spice up the story. Worth watching more than once."
3,Did anyone notice?,Is it just coincidence that his book jacket is the same color scheme of Coke????? There's clever marketing
1,Coke Overdose,"Lame, empty, boring book. The author is smug, full of himself and the kind of client an advertiser (or anyone else for that matter) hates. New Coke a coup? Hardly."
3,Wanting More,"THE END OF MARKETING AS WE KNOW IT is filled with great stories of how Sergio Zyman was able to lead the marketing of Coca-Cola to remarkable heights. I would have been pleased to get more information on the ""mechanics"" of how to measure the success of marketing. Mr.Zyman tells me to continually measure and quantify and be prepared to make changes. This is what I already knew. What I need help with - knowing how to measure and quantify, I didn't find. What I did find was several engaging ""war stories"" of how great Sergio Zyman is. Albeit interesting to hear these stories, I was disappointed to find no answers to the questions most of us in marketing have. I recommend the audio version. The book lacks the zeal found in hearing the author's passion for the hunt of customers and his great accent. By no means a waste."
3,Wake up call to marketers!,"One very clear message that make you wake up from your dream as a marketer : Marketing campaign is a failure without increasing the sales volume. It's not about image building, it's about sales! This message alone worth the money for this book.But too much Cola spoilt this book. Sometimes it seem like ""MY Biography in Cola!"
1,A Thrill-free Ride!,"I regret having to be a party-pooper, but the list of glowing Amazon reviews for this paltry sum of a book is unbelievable. Of the many rollercoaster titles out there, this has to be the most lackluster, primarily because the underambitious author set out ONLY to make a superficial guidebook that -- due to the ever-mutating coaster technology -- is already dated. Worse, the uninspiring black and white photographs fail to do these rides any justice. Most of them seem to have been culled from the same theme park publicity departments to whom the author (judging by the text) apparently ingratiated himself. As a history, it offers nothing but the same litany of facts stated again and again in such other -- much more engaging -- rollercoaster tomes as Robert Cartmell's groundbreaking THE INCREDIBLE SCREAM MACHINE. Be wise and look elsewhere on this site for other recommendations on books of this nature."
3,ok dvd,"I LOVE and respect Zen Master Seung Sahn. ALL of his books are MUST reads for anyone interested in Buddhism, Zen/Seon in particular. The plus about this DVD is to get to put a moving face and voice with this great teacher. The only down side is that the video is pretty brief and you don't get much in the way of Dharma talks/teachings, more of a ""home video"" style production of Zen Master Seung Sahn walking through the streets of Europe and some small out takes of his talks."
3,Hebrew,"I found this book had a lot of grammar, I had rather just learn to read biblical Hebrew. I found EKS course easier.I also got the CD's they really help with the pronuncication."
5,Excellent!,Without going into a bunch of detail - this is a great DVD and has much interesting detail. I love it!
4,Great Album,I first discovered this album in 2001. Simply an amazing start for a young christian dj. His subsequent albums have only gotten better.
5,strung out live,"i just bought this cd yesterday at a local music shop. After hearing it i was left with a huge abundance of enegery brouht forth by this cd. Strung Out is the only band that i know of that can record a cd live and have it sound as clear and crisp as a studio album. This so far has to be my favorite cd that the band has put out. This cd includes music all the way from, ""Too Close to See"" down to a Ozzy cover, ""Bark at the Moon"". in all i highly recomend this cd for your Strung Out music collection."
1,Lies vs anti-semitism,"The Holocaust should be presented honestly. In 1941 about 300 of Jewish inhabitants of Jedwabne, small town in eastern Poland, was burned alive in a small barn. J.T. Gross wrote they were 1600. The investigation has shown that this murder was organized by a group German occupants (some in uniforms, some in civilian clothes) who recuited help from about 40 local collaborants and criminals. J.T. Gross wrote Polish neighbors had murdered Jews from their own initiative.Result? J.T.Gross gained publicity (and money), millions of Poles feel offended by Jews..."
1,A small book for such a big controversy!,"My first reaction was what a short book it is to cause so much controversy. I had read Revolution From Abroad by this same author, and I was expecting something more substantial. Somehow, the broader perspective of the complicity of Jews in Eastern Poland who sided with the Soviets in the war is missing from this work. Not that this would excuse Poles who had collaborated with the Nazis, but Gross is trying to rewrite history here. As other historians have noted, the Soviet, Nazi, and Polish documents and witnesses are clear that this was a Nazi act. The collaboration does explain why there were bad relations between the neighbors, and why Poles in this area did not help the Jews the way the Poles in Warsaw aided the Jews there.However, it does appear the Gross has overstated the number of Jews killed to forward an agenda that Poles were collaborating with the Nazis, that Poles should pay compensation to Jews for Nazi crimes, etc.Give this book a pass."
3,Anti-Polish Trash Teaches a Valuable Lesson,"Gross,the author,falsely accuses the Poles of herding the Jews of Jedwabne into a barn and setting them on fire. Never mind the fact that actual witnesses, conveniently ignored by Gross, indicate that it was the Germans who committed this atrocity. But I give this book three stars because it nevertheless is valuable: All of the uncritical adulation this mendacious book has gotten in academia and the media serves as a valuable indicator of the depth of anti-Polish bias that exists in these pseudo-intellectual circles. Well done, Herr Jan Thomas Gross. Goebbels would have been proud."
2,"A Partial History of Actual Events, if That","As a non-historian, I cannot say that this book is true or not. Having read it, I am in no position to weigh contrary evidence. But let's suppose that it is factual. After all, Poles are not angels, and it is certainly possible that, among them, as in all other nationalities, there are those who would murder members of other religions or nationalities. Even then, this book fails to tell the whole story. Gross does his best to downplay the large number of Jews who helped the Soviet invaders of Poland round up Poles and send them to horrible deaths in the Siberian wilderness. He also fails to discuss the murders of Polish civilians (including children), by Jewish bands, during wholesale massacres of villages such as Naliboki and Koniuchy. Unlike this book, until books about past events tell the whole story, they will only be the source of further antagonism and conflict, which is the exact opposite of what the world needs."
4,"Honest, to-the-point","A very honest retelling; quite succint. Had great moments, and very vivid stories. Not recomemnded for people either sensitive to bluntness or insane jealousies."
1,Sweet Life,"I enjoyed reading every page of Barry's Sweet Life book and all the pictures inside the book, are very good.Until I started reading Barry's book for the very first time, I never knew about his pot smoking days(Bad Barry!). :-OOtherwise, it's a very interesting book to read!"
3,Her way of being a witch...,"She teaches how to be a witch in 13 moon which is a good idea and she has some great excersizes and ideas but she teaches her way of being a witch. There is nothing wrong with that but the reader has to realize that there are many other ways to practice witchcraft and her way is not THE way to do it. Sometime I get the feeling that she feels like her way is the only way. I enjoyed the book because it had some new ideas in it and some of the excersizes helped me along my way but I would not reccommend this book to a begginer. At least read 5 or 6 other books from good authors (not Silver Ravenwolf, please because she will mislead a begginer more than any other author I can think of) before tackeling this one. I would recommend it to anyone that has been studying for a year or so because it helps understand just how different the practice of magic can be."
2,Overly General,"I bought this book because I liked the idea of a moon based cycle. Though coven life is structured around the moon, most of the literature out there today is based on the Sabbats and the sun cycle. As a high priestess, I was looking forward to reading a more lunar perspective. But Witch Alone is not really based on a lunar cycle. It is simply thirteen lessons. They don't really connect to the cycles of the moon, or the wheel of the year for that matter. And there are much more basic than I realized reading the description. Basicly, it is a 13 lesson wicca 101 book, and not a great one at that. The exercises are quite basic. It is of course good to ponder what your conception of what the goddess is, or what the sun cycle means to you. But these are things that most wiccans do anyway. There weren't any ideas presented that I hadn't done before."
4,An Unfair Review,"I'll be honest, I was ready to give this book 3 stars, but the reason I wanted to was unfair to the author. The book has much information useful to the Solitary practioner, whether a beginner or not. It is not the standard ""Wicca 101"" books that many are use to reading. This book will not touch on many different topics, it will instead delve into the heart of basic knowledge that all Witches should have.The reason I wanted to give it three stars was this, it was written by a British author, which is not a bad thing. I just found it difficult to read it. The language did not lend itself well to me as an American reader. The book took me awhile to read through, but it was worth it. Buy this book."
1,broken,I ordered 2 of these lights one came broken. Returned the broken light and received another broken light as a replacement. Cut my losses on the second and returned for a refund...not worth the trouble of returns for one good light.
1,Very Bad Media,"I am getting between 250 and 500 soft errors, and a few hard errors, on every single tape. Other media works just fine, both before and after this stuff. Never expected TDK media to be so bad. Will never buy again."
3,Good D&D adventures with excellent artwork ...,"Trying to compare 'Ruin Explorers' with 'Slayers' is like comparing apples and oranges: both fruit, but both different. 'Ruin Explorers' may be just another fantasy anime series, but its artwork and animation staff made it stand far above other series of it's kind. The designs remind me a little of the American comic book Battle Chasers, the colors are lively and the sequences are funny and adeptly executed. Typically, the hodge podge of characters held together tenuously over money and treasure are at each other's throats constantly, but believably and with entertainment value. Personally, I enjoyed this 2 tape series quite a bit even though the story is fairly typical. If you want a good couple tapes to keep you entertained, these are just fine. This series would have gotten 5 stars if the story was more crafty."
3,"no good graphics, but ok",the railroad games are crap but mall tycoon is good.airport tycoon will not work on my computer for some reason.but it was only like $15
2,Poor presentation,"What a waste of time! The line-up of comedians is the B-listers yet they betray their high ranking with some lousy acts. Ray Romano does a decent job in trying to save the show but he cannot do it on his own. Sinbad simply isn't funny. Bill Bellamy is below par owing to his restricted repertoire. Overall, you would do well to give this one a miss."
3,Elementary P.E. Teacher,"This book was required for one of my graduate level classes. This book is easy reading, and it provides the reader with helpful information. Not only does this book describe the process of developing and implementing an interdisciplinary thematic unit, but it also gives great examples of thematic units. This book is a great reference for developing interdisciplinary thematic units."
4,Thematic Units,The Thematic Unit Guide is a very useful book forsomeone who need to organize their information. Thestep by step processes help to build a thematic unit.
4,Easy to follow guide book!,"As a clearly worded, easy-to-follow guide, this text is a must-read for teachers interested in writing ITUs. Teachers will appreciate its step-by-step procedures, and evaluative lists to ensure a quality, finished thematic unit. It is an valuable aid for all educators!"
4,Interdisciplinary Thematic Units,I took a course online and this was one of the required books. This book was a great reference. It provides very helpful and useful information. It was of great assistance to me when creating my thematic unit. I would recommend this book to anyone needing guidance on organizing a thematic unit.
4,A Students Revies,"A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Thematic Units by Richard D. Kellough and Patricia L. Roberts provides an outstanding road map for creating lesson plans of this nature. It takes you from concept to completion, and is an easy guide to follow. As an added bonus, this text presents exercises at the end of each chapter so one can practice what they have learned. I found this useful for the chapters that I read, and didn't feel I had a good grasp on what was being presented. After completing the exercises, any confusion or misconception was cleared up, at least in my mind anyway."
5,Review of A Guide for Developing Interdisciplinary Units,I was very impressed with this book! The authors did a great job explaing the components of a thematic unit and the sample lessons were a great resource. This book is wonderful for someone who is beginning to crete thematic units.
4,Maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary instruction,"As a foreign language teacher, I have been accustomed to presenting materials in thematic units. The text provided practical lesson plan examples, illustrations and guidelines for evaluating cross-curricular units in an easy to read/reference format. This book has helped me to modify several of my existing practical units and maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary instructional strategies."
5,ear cleaner,"I already reviewed this, but it is the best ear cleaner for dogs and cats, and have also used it on myself. It's for cleaning and itching, and smells good..."
1,Poor Quality,"After less than 15 hours of occasional use, the CD player stopped working. When it did work, sound quality was poor to fair, at best, although portable shower radio/CD players are certainly not designed to provide high-end sound anyway. The radio tuner was weak and picked up only the strongest local signals. Overall, a very low-end product with obvious design and functional deficiencies. The price is low but not low enough to reflect the poor quality."
1,Junk,don't waste your money. Its poor quality and not worth the hassle of taking it out of the wrapper.
3,More helpful books are out there.,"I agree with the other reviewers, especially in that it does not spend a lot of time providing ""answers""; the title is definitely misleading. A far better and more sensitive book is by Alexander Levy, ""The Orphaned Adult"". Please read it even if if you have a surviving parent."
4,The Thief,"A first-rate crime thriller where Ray Milland and Rita Gam strut their stuff. Following in the footsteps of the gritty realism that 40's crime thrillers were about, this is an exceptionally well-acted (Ray Milland and Rita Gam are terrific), absorbing and entertaining movie with a classic espionage story.Although the movie has a simple, but solid Film-Noir story, it is clear that the success of the film rests with the performance of Ray Milland.If you want a smart, gritty Film-Noir with brains, you can't do much better than The Thief (1952)."
3,sweetly innocent and charming illuminations,"The illustrations are sweetly innocent and charming, but somehow neither holy nor inspiring (the best one is the cover).The descriptions of the different saints are quite interesting, and although they include the details of how the different saints died, it would be a matter of how you raise your children that decides you on this book.Example on Saint Catherine:""Catherine was tied between great spiked wheels, but it is said that lightning struck the wheel and saved her from this torture. Catherine was then beheaded, and milk, not blood, flowed from her body. ""I suppose that one of the cornerstones of Saints & martyrs being declared is the manner of their death, therefore it is relevant.Recommended reading group 8+"
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"I have to agree with B. Morris. He (or she?) is not exaggerating and neither am I - this is one of the greatest albums ever made. I would put it into my top 20 or even top 10. No matter how many times I listen to it, I never seem to get sick of it. This is timeless, simple, honest roots music. ""Mercenary Song"" is an absolute gem. It's such an uplifting song...it's like a breath of fresh air...as if an exclamation mark is at the end of every line. Just when the world thought Mr. Earle was finished, he gives us this. Talk about a come back..."
3,Average,"These are nice sizes. The bristles do fall out while using and washing. They work just fine otherwise, except if you use melted butter when making your pastries. These bristles are too delicate to handle the heat."
2,Upset,"I was upset when the 1.5"" brush came apart from the handle after one use while washing it. I thought for the price I had paid that these would last a little longer. Now I am trying to figure out if I can re-glue or find another way to repair the middle sized brush. Disappointed."
5,Fantastic Rock and Soul fusion!,"Unlike anything you are likely to hear nowadays, Labelle's ""Something Silver"" captures the best from their early 70's recordings when they liberally fused Rhythm & Blues, Rock , Funk and Politics. Patti Labelle has never sounded better than when Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash were at her side. CD features a funky cover of Cat Stevens' ""Moonshadow"" and a tender version of the Rolling Stones'""Wild Horses"". The best tracks are those penned by group member Nona Hendryx: the rousing ""Sunday's News"",the bluesy ""If I Can't Have You"", and the highlight of the whole affair is the gospel-inflected ""I Believe That I've Finally Made It Home"" (one of my all-time favorite songs). A classic!!!!"
1,Chopping Writing,For me this book was very disappointing. It was very negative. The thing that really bothered me was the writing. The writing was very choppy. I enjoy reading books were the writing flows well and is easy to read. I don't know if this is a particular writing style or the author is just a bad writer.
3,I'm just not sure,"Let me first of all say that I LOVED Hawksong! It was amaizingly good, and brightened my summer. So imagine my delight when I found out there was going to be a sequel.I thought Snakecharm was good, but not quite as good as Hawksong. I liked Zane's narrative style, but felt that all of a sudden, he and Danica seemed like they were fifty years old. It just didn't have the same charm, and it didn't seem like they had the same passion for their lives as they had in the first. Maybe it was because this volume focused more politics than the two themseleves, but it just wasn't as good."
2,A disappointment,"This is one of Atwater's worst books yet, the plot bounces aimlessly in every direction, without a clear goal. Zane, the serpiente who is marrying his counterpart Danica, spends most of his time whining like an eleven year old child, his character lost all of his charm from the previous book, and spiraled downwards. Danica's character, who was once well rounded, became static as she feel into the weak damsel in distress role, which was the complete opposite in the previous book. The theme of the story is alright, but the characters lost every ounce of personality that made them so addicting.... after reading this book i would strong reconsider purchasing another of her books."
2,Annie's Review,"I liked the book. But it was very slow, and it felt almost as if everyone were TOO much at ease with each other in the begining. When the falcon comes, it was almost I was bored by how scared of the b#%*$ everyone was. And it felt like nothing had been accomplished when they got their people back. Not her best, but if you wan a conclusion for Hawksong, go ahead."
4,Good but...,"i agree that it isnt amelia's best book but i still liked it. for me, it was easy to remember that the story is from zane's point of view. what surprises though! a few were obvious but some hit you like a punch in the gut from your best friend! you should read haksong first to fully understand this one and why the surprises really matter! definitely worth checking out from the library at the very least."
3,Cute potty book for girly girls,"My two year old liked this book quite a bit, particularly if I read it with funny English accents for all the characters (except the maker of the pink potty who became Australian for some reason). But I'm not sure it motivated her to use the potty. It did, for us at least, reinforce what we told our daughter, namely that she, like the princess, would use the potty when she was ready. She trained very easily at 30 months because she wanted to, not because of any the books we read her. But potty books are still a great idea because they familiarize kids with the concepts associated with the potty and reassure them the the journey from diapers to potty is one that everyone goes through. If you have a toddler who likes princesses and pretty things, she will probably at the very least get a kick out of this book."
2,Cute but not very effective,"This is a cute story, but unfortunately it didn't have the effect I was hoping for. My 3 year got stuck on the fact that the potty didn't please the princess rather than the fact she eventually used it."
2,4 Panel Large Bill Flap Hat - Olive,"It was returned. It was too big, dark and floppy. Prefer something smaller, collapsible and easy to pack. Something light"
4,"Not bad, but rear flap needs more siding","Pretty good, not great. The brim is a decent size to block the sun, but I have to wonder why many of these rear-flapped hats don't go a bit more around the sides to block side-glancing sun? There's a long string with a clip at the end to beckle the hat to you, but the clip is metal and heavy, and shoud be a liter plastic because, unless you clip the string to the brim or hat, it will swing and slap the heavy metal lip around on your back. It's a keeper but not a repeat buy."
4,Wonderfully Twisted,"How many pictures can you see the male writer ably playing the role of a female investigating cop?The whole movie plays like the initial lawn scene in Blue Velvet - on the surface everything is placid and innocent, underneath, the hidden critters are fighting savagely to the death. Psycho Beach Party's exterior is a satiric nod to the brainless beach party movies in the `60s era of the young Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. What's under the surfin' is a tangled wilderness of murder, madness, and general kinky behavior. And it's all handled with manic, even camp, enthusiasm. Directed by Robert Lee King and written by Charles Busch from his stage play."
4,Good Cloud Identification,Excellent book. Using this along with a couple others to get back into weather forcasting Thank you for an excellent book
2,TRUE DIVA W/O A CLUE,"Sandra St. Victor's voice is that of a true DIVA. However, I can only give this cd two stars because of the sexual content. Why do exceptional voices get wasted on terrible songs?"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this table for my first baby and it's a decent product but it definitely could use some work on the manufacturing side. When putting the table together the middle screws on the table legs don't fit in properly. It looks like when drilling the holes for them they were made too shallow so the screw isn't long enough to fit in securely. Also when trying to put the screws in the right side of the drawers, the screws couldn't get a bite into the wood and never went in. Also, I had problems with Storkcraft customer service trying to get replacement parts sent to me. First it took over three weeks to ship them and what they sent was the wrong parts then no one would call me back after I left three messages to fix the problem. I ordered the new part on 30 Sep and now it's 12 Nov and I still don't have the replacement part, Overall though, even without the drawer and the middle screws it is still a pretty sturdy table that works well as a changing table."
3,"Just OK, in my opinion","I bought this on Amazon because my supermarket doesn't keep the falafel stocked, and most of the time it is sold out. The Casbah 10-pack is a good value and now I have enough falafel to last awhile, and the 10-ounce bag means you can easily cook a up a big batch without having to open multiple packets. But I have to say that the flavor is just OK, not as great as the other review would indicate in my opinion. Actually less spicy than the brand from my local store. Still, it is good. I may buy Casbah again, but probably I will try one of the other brands first."
2,Disappointing,"They say 101 Recipes, but too many of them were just a variation of the same recipe. For example, the recipes would be identical except one might have called for strawberries, another one blueberries and the next one raspberries. They called it three recipes whereas I would say one recipe and list the variations. Didn't feel like I was getting 101 recipes. Very disappointed."
3,"Excellent classic, but not for the adrenaline addict","The Charlie Chan Chanthology is a compilation of some of the more famous movies spun off from the series. Full of quirkly lines and filled with interesting and memorable stereotypes from the period, it is a good set to have if you are planning to break into the series. However, like other films from the period, the pacing is slow and action scenes are almost non-existent--so if you are looking to get a typical hollywood suspense/mystery/thriller, then you will likely be sorely disappointed."
2,Not the Best of Charlie Chan by a longshot...,"As others have commented, these are the Monogram movies that came out post-WWII and not very good when compared to the earlier movies from Fox (featuring Sydney Toler with #2 son Victor Sen Young and before that Warner Oland with #1 son Keye Luke). While I don't want to discourage anyone from these, know that these are not the movies that Chan enthusiasts such as myself know and love and that there is much better that has not (yet) made it to DVD. I do hope someone at Fox or whoever owns the rights to these movies gets the message and releases *those* movies on DVD. This is like releasing a James Bond series but excluding the Sean Connery films. I really wished they would have released those earlier movies first and issued these later."
5,best waffle mix available,"Having tried most of the commercially available waffle mixes, and several 'from scratch' recipes. the Classique Faire mix has the best flavor of all. It is very simple to use, and produces light, crisp, flavorful waffles. The optional pancake recipe is wonderful for crepes. My family insists that I only use this mix."
3,Dated but fascinating,"When I first heard this recording of Purcell's ""Come Ye Sons of Art"" over the radio some 25 years ago, I was struck dumb with amazement. A man could sing like this? Since then, the skills of countertenors have improved markedly, and revisiting this performance was a bit of a let down. That said, it is a fascinating bit of musical history, a decent performance that gives us a look at the dawn of the modern countertenor phenomenon. Sir Michael Tippett conducts the Ode on St. Cecelia's day, and for circa 1960 these are good recordings, well conducted. Alfred Deller's place in musical history is secure."
1,The Delta ... Aka The Snooze,"I would rather have a root canal than have to watch this ""dog"" again. I have ALL ""gay"" movies and this is the worst! Sorry!"
1,The Delta,Take all the negative reviews left by everyone and believe them. This movie is so bad...it's worst than bad. I would not even give it the star I gave it...but had to rate it somehow...which is why it got the one star. The actors are boring...the plot ( what plot ??? ) is nonexistent...everything about this movie sucks! Don't waste your money on this one...I got rid of my copy...would never watch this kind of inept film again. It does not depict being gay in a positive way...rather it shows the ugly side of it...very ugly side.
2,This movie needs English subtitles,"The best thing about this movie is Shayne Gray who should have a successful career ahead of him.The worst thing about this movie is that it is almost impossible to understand what Thang Chan is saying. Chan plays John or Minh Nguyen, a half Vietnamese half African American.This movie really needs English subtitles so that the viewer can know what Chan is saying as well as some of the other actors whose voices are drowned out.One synopsis said that Shayne Gray who plays Lincoln Bloom is a handsome student ""from a wealthy Jewish family."" I saw nothing in the movie that indicated that Lincoln was Jewish or from a wealthy family. He drove a run down older car. His father's house is small and apparently from the 1960s.I found the ending quite disturbing. It came from nowhere.Except for watching Shayne Gray, I really do not recommend this movie."
3,I'd rate it about 3 & 1/2 stars,"Although I didn't like this one as well as Taming the Heiress, I am always impressed with King's meticulous research. This novel provided an interesting dilemma, but it was almost too involved, too convoluted. The ending was well done, but something about the romance seemed lacking. The characters, especially Aedan, were not as strong as in the previous novel."
5,Well written piece full of excitement,"Excellent and well written novel with a creative scope. I've read novels written by other African-American authors and I have to say that this is one of the best. It is a book filled with excitement about love, relationships, and self-identity. It is truly a page turner, once you pick it up you WILL NOT want to put it down until you reach the ""alternate"" ending. Kaira Denee is well on her way!!!!!!!"
5,Hours of Fun,"My dogs play with these balls all day. Try as they might, they cannot chew through the balls. They are not like tennis balls, which my dogs destroy within minutes. These balls are strong and great. The colors make them easy to find in the yard. My dogs LOVE them!"
2,Be careful!!,"I purchased 2 packs of these balls recently for my Chocolate Lab. He loved them, became his favorite toy to play fetch with immediately. But, be VERY CAREFUL... we've had them about a week, and last night, playing fetch outside, my dog almost choked to death when he caught this ball out of the air, and it went right down into his throat. My labrador is average-sized for his breed (about 75 lbs). After rushing to the vet in a panic, and paying a $163 vet bill, I will be getting rid of these immediately, and trying out the larger size ""Chuckit! Ultra Ball Large 3-inch, 1 pack"" instead... Thankfully, he's OK! Just wanted to warn anyone considering these for a mid to large size dog!"
1,payment issue,"this company declined by bonus points on my credit card, which no other company has done, Don't need them. bye"
2,Doggy happy & Daddy happy .. but the price!??!,"The price is exorbitant! As a kid I played with rubber balls costing $0.10. And this is not much different. I purchased them as a Christmas gift for my GSD pup, since he loves to play fetch. Around $12 with shipping costs.However I am afraid of losing them, given their high cost, so they are in storage and we end up playing with full rubber (to the core) balls - much superior to this - I purchased for $0.50 each at the local grocery store.No difference, its just a rubber ball. And don't believe that its made of some ""super tough"" material. Its just another ball. NOTHING special to deserve this kind of price.The price is EXCESSIVE."
5,Great for chewers,Awesome! Dogs cannot tear it apart at all. Hours of fun and no cleanup afterwards. Already bought another pack for when these get lost.
4,My lab LOVES her new ball!,"So far, so good!! Each time she gets a new ball, it's torn up in minutes. Two days and not a mark on it....and she hasn't let it out of her sight! Would get 5 stars if the price was a bit lower, but well worth what I paid if they continue to hold up!"
3,Okay,They are great to use with the launcher but you can just use any other tennis ball which will probably be cheaper.
2,Only lasted two months,"Apparently, my pug has shark teeth because she just got through the ""indestructible"" ball after one month. Now it has a big hole, and soon enough there will be no ball."
5,superb,Really tough ball. Used everyday and still not destroyed. Well worth the money.can't believe how tough these balls are. Still no teeth marks in them. Highly recommended ....
5,BEST dog toy ever,"Our dog is a powerful chewer and literally destroys toys (and other things) in minutes that are marked as durable. Even the Kong Extreme toys that lasts other dogs months, she will destroy within 2 hours into hundreds of pieces. The ChuckIt! Ultra balls on the other hand are phenomal. We have had two of them for over 6 months, and there is hardly a scratch or mark on them, and it's her favorite toy. She loves chasing them around, playing fetch with them, and sleeping with them. She seems lost when she can't see one of these balls within viewing distance. Even though they may seem expensive initially, trust me they are worth every penny compared to all the poor quality dog toys out there on the market today. Your dog will love it, and it WILL last."
2,Dont like the banners,"I bought this for projection shows for the visuals only and though it has some cool visuals, it also has on screen titles & banners that ruin the visuals."
2,Exotic Robotcs,Ok Ok Ok I'll talk but please turn this dvd off! I've seen worse.One has to wonder if they made their money back on this.
5,A way out for common health problems,"The book gives me a new perspective towards ""health"" from the traditional ""nutrition"" way. This pH perspective takes a ""total approach"" towards health. You will know the real causes of some common illness like asthma, heart diseases, gall stones, mental illness, blood problems......which are actually caused by bad eating habits/choices. Then you will know how to find a way out from those diseases. The book is written in very simple language, an average people can understand it very easily. Having understood the reasons why we choose out food in a 8:2 ratio (8=vege, 2=protein/carbohydrate), it is so easy to apply the priciple in my daily life to stay healthy. It is recommended to read the other books from the author - Dynamic Health, An apple a day and Exercise or Diet."
4,gotcha,"This was interesting, and very readable. I enjoyed it, although I still say the author uses foreshadowing way too much. But in this story, the author plays some really good tricks on the reader - Charlie Moon keeps repeating there is a reasonable explanation for everything, but we get sidetracked by the metaphysical - the visions, shamans, symbolism, dreams and so on. I usually can figure out just about any mystery, but the author had me on this one. I was surprised at the resolution of the mystery, and had a good laugh, too."
4,"An excellent mix of humor, history and ST culture","Brilliantly edited documentary of the Star Trek phenomenon. Being a Star Trek fan helps the viewer understand some of the more discrete ""inside"" jokes, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. The editor(s) has done a superb job of mixing the stories and interviews so the viewer transistions between laughing, slapping their foreheads in disbelief, and the occasional stark realization of just how influential Start Trek is in our culture."
3,Honest look at the phenomenon,"A straight forward no, nonsense peek into the phenomenon of Star Trek fanaticism. Denise Crosby, presents a fairly unbiased look at the world of the Star Trek fan. Viewers can make up his or her own mind as to whether it's all in good fun, or that some of these people aren't ""working with all thrusters"".Essentially it is a collection interviews with fans at conventions as well as interviews with all the major cast members.As a documentary it is somewhat loosely put together. Let's just say it won't win any academy awards for best documentary.This DVD--licensed by Paramount-- and therefore, as usual overpriced is a low budget documentary which the studio clearly aimed at the die-hard fan willing to pay anything."
3,"It's OK, but gets boring toward the end","I wasn't expecting too much and was neither overly surprised nor overly disappointed with it. It's on the one had a ""thank you"" to the fans of the show, supplanted with tidbits and insights from the various stars; but there's also something ""mean spirited"" about parts of it that I found somewhat offensive; i.e., lingering too long at some points on the ""fanatic"" aspects of some fans, rather than on the good-spirited fun most fans have with the show and its characters. It's also far too long... I found myself fast-forwarding through the last 15 minutes or so because I was getting bored with seeing the same bad-quality, bouncing video footage over and over again. Fans of the original series will be happy to see their favorites, but Next Generation fans get sort of ""ripped off"" by being able to see only a select few of their favorites. (Brent Spiner is delightful, but seen far too seldom to have much of an mpact on this piece.) Bottom line: Rent it. Don't buy it."
4,Good looking kling on,"I think the best way to describe all of our youthful activities for the most part as akward..it is true of these folks.. They include some of the funniest moments ever caught on tape. I told you not to call here, we are busy! Good stuff. Great doc. Buy it!"
5,Great!,"Was a little worried when I saw that this item wouldn't arrive at my house until mid August-mid September! But it ended up taking maybe a week! Exactly what I wanted, and at a great price too!"
3,Not great for people with large feet,As other people have stated they are a bit flimsy so they won't help pull up on the pedals. From my experience the sole purpose of these clips is to keep your feet in the correct location on the pedals. They work well for this but the issue I ran into is that the clips don't have enough side to side adjustment to let my foot be centered on the pedal. I should add that I have a size 13 shoe and I'm using these clips on XLC Alloy pedals. I have the side adjustment maxed out but my foot is still pointed slightly inwards (toward the bike). I could probably drill some additional holes in the pedals but I think I'm going to try a set of power grips or full cage pedals instead.
5,just what i needed,"These mountain bike half toe clips are easy to install, lightweight yet tough, priced right. And they came quickly, that was appreciated."
4,Nice sturdy toe-clip,"A very well made toe-clip, except, it fits only to the regular straight edge type pedal, the other bigger platform type with in-set slots will not fit in at all, so be aware which type of pedal you have before you order, I have 2 bikes came with larger platform pedals will not fit, so I changed my original pedal to a bit smaller ones, with this added it actually gives you more pedal-grabbing control on my mountain bikes, I'm a recreational mtb rider so don't want to invest those clip-less type of pedal yet, am happy with these for now.Straight > http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013G6PLS/ref=s9_qpp_gw_p200_d31_g200_ir01?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_r=0TJK88BH61YQEF2AYQX2&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=470938631&pf;_rd_i=507846Platform > http://www.amazon.com/Diamondback-Sound-Pedal-Black-Alloy/dp/B001C3AU22/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1339792562&sr;=8-2&keywords;=platform+pedal"
1,Do not buy,These clips are useless. The plastic is not nearly strong enough to handle the upward pull on them- and the clips deform easily. Get clips with a strap instead.
1,Waste Of Money - don't buy !,"This thick gel did not dissipate well into my dog's skin like more expensive products do. I bought this in addition to the Bio Spot flea collar. Did not cure flea problem at all. A week after application, he has chewed hair from the base of his tail, constantly scratches himself. Looks terrible. Poor dog had to suffer because I tried to save money. I just ordered Frontline from Amazon. Negative zero stars is what it deserves, but Amazon doesn't offer that rating as an option."
1,You get what you pay for,"I have been using this product for 2 months now on my dog. Recently he acquired a flea infestation, which this product should have prevented. Not only did he get fleas, which he shouldn't have in the first place, but this product didn't kill the fleas once he had them which it claims to do. I followed the directions exactly, so there is no reason this product shouldn't have worked. I have used Advantage in the past and been very pleased with it, however I was not pleased with the price, so I decided to give this brand a try. We live in Florida, which is naturally buggy, therefore I highly recommend against this product to anyone living in warm climates where fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes are abundant."
1,SUCKS BIG TIME!!,"I had originally bought 2 of these bikes, one for me and one for my older brother. When I received them I found the boxes in complete disarray. Which is probably why I had missing parts. The bikes themselves looked so weak and unstable and actually felt really uncomfortable. From missing parts and the overall appearance and feel of the bikes, I obviously returned them. Fogdog was the shipper and their rep was a complete jerk to me over the phone. I eventually bought two more bikes form shwinn that are top notch."
2,"Doesn't fit our 16"" tires","This looks like a great product--if only it fit our 16"" travel trailer tires.....even though it advertises that it fits 16"" tires......sorry but had to return it. Thank you."
3,Restricts air flow,"It doesn't leak and works as a quick disconnect, but it does restrict air flow. It is tricky to make a good connection."
3,Good for hard-core Hugh Laurie fans,"I bought this because I'm a fan of both Hugh Laurie and Anna Chancellor and thought it might be fun to see them in something together. The series wasn't *bad*, exactly, but it was at best average, and I'm not surprised it wasn't renewed. The cast did a good job trying to make the characters three-dimensional, but, unfortunately, most of the show's running themes were somewhat juvenile and cliched. All in all a mixed bag."
3,"Disappointing comedy from the star of ""Jeeves and Wooster"" and ""House""","I found it hard to like Paul Slippery (played by Hugh Laurie). He's a neurotic man going through a mid-life crisis with all the frantic jabbering and funny voices he developed in the Jeeves and Wooster series. It's hard to generate any sympathy or even interest in the travails of his character let alone those of his three randy sons. Anna Chancellor, on the other hand, is appealing and sympathetic as his wife. Hugh Laurie is the director and lead actor so he deserves much of the blame for this show's failings. Granted, the writers gave him very little to work with other than overworked sight gags, stale clichés, and highly predictable comic set pieces. The good news is that the second episode is nowhere near as bad as the first episode."
5,Perfect balance of soul and skill,"This is by far my favorite Joshua Redman recording, along with his playing on Chick Corea's Tribute to Bud Powell (1997). Some of his older recordings were too flashy for me, and the Times Changing session too ""academic."" On this session, however, Redman finds the perfect blend of unity and variety. The grooves are inspiring, and the melodies are bluesy yet very unique. Harmonically adventurous, yet soulful and spirited. I would even venture so far as to call this session the Blue Trane of the 90's."
2,Poorly done,Skip this series.The narration is poor propoganda narration from WW2 and the film selection is not very impressive.The coverage of the second world war is much better addressed in many other productions making this series barely watchable to history buffs.
2,Madonna's Vocal range too narrow for the part,"Know this is a review of the sound track; however I must back track. The movie would have probably not been made if Madonna were not part of it. There were many great additions to the movie that paralleled the real events surrounding the life of Evita, especially the portrayal of the Navel Cadets' uprising. The new lyrics fit in well also. I can understand some license taken when converting from stage to the big screen. I can even tolerate that Madonna usurped the ""An Other Suitcase"" song which deviated from the story so she could be the object of attention. However she does not have the range or stamina to sing such major songs as ""Don't Cry for Me"". Being the major reason for purchasing this CD. I would have to say save your money.Evita (1978 Original Broadway Cast)"
1,none,I am shocked that she is making a profit off the crimes of her children. It isn't necessary to gather extra pity almost thirty years after the deaths of her five children.
3,Somewhat palatable,I started treating some urinary discomfort issues for my cat with a cranberry powder...very effective and the cats like it. The cats licked at this product but did not actually eat it all and I don't like stuffing things down my cats throat...too uncomfortable for both of us.
1,Boys Town,Terrible bathroom humor and violent to boot. Wouldn't watch the whole season unless I was being tortured. It has a fun premise for about 4 minutes into the film.
2,I hope it gets better after the first episode,The pilot was good enough to get me to see the first episode. The first episode was bad enough to keep me from seeing the second episode. The humor is for school kids. I would have liked it if I was still in school. The DVD was a gift so I'll push through to the second episode. I hope it gets more intelligent.If I was terminal I would let my wife know and I wouldn't start a carrier destroying other people lives before I died.
5,Start Here for One Helluva Show,"I've heard from a few different friends on how great this show is, but I've never seen it before a few weeks ago. I burned through the first season in about 2 days (There are only 7 or 8 episodes). Yep, I was hooked. Purchased seasons 2, 3, and 4 soon after. Then I bought the first half of Season 5 on Amazon Video on Demand. I'm all caught up now and can't wait until the conclusion to the series next summer. Very highly recommended show and worth every penny. I haven't seen the special features so that will give me something to watch while I wait."
4,First Blu-ray purchase,This was my first Blu-ray purchase and I have wanted to see this show for a long time. The picture and sound were perfect and the show was as good as I hoped!
2,brain dead tv,"brain dead tv for the brain dead masses, brain dead tv for the brain dead massses, not much to say i guess"
3,Problem with the concept,"Like my review of the pilot... Great acting, excellent dialogue... Very disturbing plot line about a high school science teacher who runs a meth lab. Doesn't improve my self image or personal happiness to watch this story."
3,BluRay for Season one isn't worth the money!,"Everything has been thoroughly covered in all of the above reviews about this great drama series. I saw Breaking Bad on standard DVD and AMC, so I bought the BluRay. I was totally disapointed in the picture resolution. The grain is a constant distraction, especially of blue skies and dark scenes. To call this ""high def"" is just totally wrong and a unnecessary ripoff, since I'm sure they have the technical ability to produce a perfect picture such as Boardwalk Empire. Shame on you for taking my money under false pretenses.Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season"
4,Breaking Good,"This program examines the path that can lead a respectable man to begin, and continue, to raltionzlise behavior that he would generally see as reprehensible. It also hoist the self righteous on the horns of their own weakness. I recommend it.An exciting examination of good vs. evil vs. good. The story line stays together very well, the characters are believable....overall a good tale told well."
4,Very good fit,A very good but initially not a perfect fit. I have a couple of the Manfrotto tripods that take this quick release mount and a few video and DSLR cameras that share them. The original metal quick release plates are a bit smaller - just a bit - and fit the tripod's fitting a bit better. These plastic ones are a good match but have taken a bit of time to wear in to fit perfectly as if they were one or two one thousands of an inch too big. Find fit now and much less expensive than the metal ones I found elsewhere. The plastic ones are plenty strong enough for a video camera or DSLR with a larger lens.
5,An exciting new book,"Riders of the Wind is an exciting new book by Robert F. DeBurgh that portrays the lifestyles, fashions and attitudes of the prohibition and depression era. The story moves at a rapid pace and carries the reader through adventure and romance set against the background of the pioneering years of aviation. This book is a must for the aviation history buff, the retro enthusiast or the reader simply interested in life in the USA during the 1920s and 1930s. I absolutely loved it."
1,Do Not Buy,I purchased this item for a birthday present. It broke within 5 minutes of being opened. Do NOT recommend purchasing.
1,An awful lot of spanking,"This book is definately geared toward the S&M scene. I was expecting a reworking of the Dracula story with a more modern, open minded sexuality. Instead it was one paddling after another, and then some whipping. The book was pretty much one long string of S&M 'sex' scenes with little else inbetween.Jonathan goes to castle Dracula -spanking- ,he leaves -more bondage. Dracula goes to England -a lot of spanking and more hard core S&M. They all go to Transylvania -even more discipline.The end is awful. Doesn't even really finish the story, just finishes.What was the point?"
4,It was great.,"I had never read any of Mark Leyner before this, but I saw ""Et Tu Babe"" in the store, and out of curiousity, I picked it up. From the first paragraph, Leyner had me engrossed. There was never a dull moment; every sentence seemed to ""shock"" or at least somewhat amuse me. It took me only 2 days to read the book. I would have to say that the book's weakness was that it really didn't have a plot, but still it was great and I look forward to reading another of Leyner's I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who likes bizarre-type stuff."
3,Af ew hours Invested....,You'll need to invest a few hours to make this program function as it is designed. A thick manual included but trial and error will get you to where you want to be. Not for the computer newbies (if there are people out there like that).
4,Interesting...but please get the details right,"I enjoy Mr. Simmons' character. He is vaguely sympathetic and the plot seems to work out very cleverly, without resorting to the deuz ex machina. But...PLEASE get a technical consultant to get the guns and cars right. You can't ""thumb back the hammer"" on a ""Glock 9"", however dramatic it might seem."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN......,"An Independent Consultant for The Pampered Chef! Only Independent Consultants can offer the guarantee/warranty on Pampered Chef Products! If this person had purchased from an Independent Consultant, his stone would have been replaced, NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!PROTECT YOURSELF!!"
1,This stone cannot handle high temperatures,"This stone spontaneously split into several pieces when cooking pizzas on my outdoor grill, the first time this stone was used. The (indirect) cooking temperatures were in the range of 600 - 650 deg F. Choose another stone if you plan to cook as I did."
3,A little more meat,"This is a well written, engaging book. If you have ever heard Mark Driscoll preach, you will recognize his style...he writes the same way.He gives some ""confessions"". He certainly stirs up the reader to think about how to make the church they attend grow, preferably by winning souls. It has some good information in it. I just wish it had more. Then again, this was not meant to be a ""how-to"" as much as a ""how-was"".All in all I have to recommend this book pretty highly. It will build your desire to get out and reach the unchurched/lost in your area. His sermon series on the book of Nehemiah is also worth listening to."
5,Simple profound truths!,"Without going into much detail I can only say that this is a profoundly grounded book on Zen and how practice can inform and help you find your center in the craziness of everyday life. The stories and anecdotes are poignant and personally relevant, even those from two thousand years ago. As a Zen ""sitter"" and psychotherapist I can attest that this man has experienced something that I would like to partake in. His ordinary truths and practical examples are most helpful for those of us who are also practicing ""in the busy marketplace"" of life. But I have errored by writing too much already, as the title explains, ""Open Mouth, Already a Mistake"". Try reading this one. I am not an authority, but it really spoke to something truly profound which is my understanding of the Buddha's central message, ""Vow to save all beings from suffering"" (including yourself). Yours in the dharma, Just an ordinary guy:)."
3,Good to hear Aaron Neville and Taj Mahal on this soundtrack,"I purchased this CD because of Eric Clapton's, song, ""Change the World."" But it was a nice surprise to hear Aaron Neville do the Van Morrison song, ""Crazy Love"". I listen to that song as much as ""Change the World"". I was also very happy to hear ""The Taj"" on this CD. I saw him a number of times in concert singing Corinna, and although I remember him singing this song more ""bluesy"" it is still great to hear him. The rest of the CD is OK, but I find myself jumping to these three songs and overlooking the rest. This CD is worth owning just to hear the songs I mentioned."
3,Easy to make but...,This mix is very easy to make but I prefer a mix that allows me to control the amount of seasoning. Brands like Near East have a separate seasoning packet so that I can adjust the flavor strength. The Casbah mix is a bit to strong for me. But that's just personal preference.
2,Taught Me to Stay in the Romance Isle,"I loved the first two books in this series. They were historically rich and had passionate characters. This third book was just tripe. The pacing was too fast and the ending made me throw the book across the room. I didn't even finish it. I got 3/4's of the way through the book and saw that the author was actually going to abandon a relationship nurtured through 2 1/2 books. I skimmed the rest and saw I was right.I feel like I wasted my time getting to know these characters. I read books for ""happy endings"" which is not what Mrs. Graeme-Evans provided."
4,In The Crack On The Floor,"Offcell is a pretty amalgamation of Pinback's best elements- beautiful harmonizing, intelligent vocals, and well-utilized instruments, all wrapped up in warped melancholia that leaves a hazy feel on the mind. The four tracks leading up to Gray Machine are all interesting little gems, but the highlight of the album, my favorite, is most certainly the aforementioned Gray Machine. The longest Pinback song I've ever heard, it's an intricate ballad efflorescing with blissful, distended harmonies and heart torn vocals. This ep is well worth the price for that song alone. For nonfans and fans alike, I recommend this."
2,nice stand after a trip to the hardware store,"The are good, but grossly over priced stands. The screws that mount the base to the stand were about half the length needed. I bought 1 inch screws (1/2 inch supplied with stands) which solved the problem. Don't waste a day like I did trying to make the screws work. Get the to a hardware store, take one of the base screws with you, and buy 7 in case you lose one. Make sure the threads are the same. This will solve the problem, and keep your blood pressure down, too."
3,Partially works,"While this product works well with lamps and fans that have knobs that you turn, it only half works with fans or other products that turn on with buttons. For example, I have a fan that you press the button three times to go from low to high to off. The remote will turn it off, but won't turn it back on. Same thing with a button-only air conditioner. However, it does turn my twist-dial fan both on and off."
5,It just keeps getting better all the time...,"This is the most refreshing music I have heard since the original Kansas way back when. Kerry Livgren just keeps on getting better and better! The band is fantastic! It just goes to show that above all, not matter how good the vocals are, or how great the instrumentation is, songwriting is ultimately what really matters and Livgren really has the handle on it! Please buy this and anything else with Kerry's name. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Magi'I of Cyador,"This novel started out very strong, however the entire center consisted of a series of events that were just repeated over and over again. When things finally start to happen, and you get excited the book simply ends. The reader is left hanging with no explanation. For a 444 page book, it has relatively very little in it. If this is the beginning of a series, then it seems that it was forced into two books when it should have been one. All in all it was very disapointing."
3,Choppy but a good book to get from the library,"I have rather enjoyed all of Modesitt's books, but this was one of the hardest to get into. The plot was extremely choppy. Just when the story started to get engrossing, the setting would change, and that plot line would be over with. It very much seemed as if the author was a little bored with the story as well, causing this disjointed thought process. It was a good book, but wait for the paperback."
3,Modesitt-ly Misleading,"L.E. is one of the few authors I actually still read. I am a large fan of the Recluce Saga and wait patiently for the next book which details more and more history of the land. I am not completely sure, but it seems to me that his writing style has changed a little (I noticed this more-so in Gravity Dreams than Magi'i, but anyway) over time. I suppose you could say it has grown, but it took me a few chapters to get used to it. The book was slow at times, and as stated in some other reviews, just as it starts to really pick up, he ends the novel. BAM! Story over, with not even a ""To be Continued in <next novel>"" which really just hurt my opinion of L.E. Anyway, it's worth the read, but probably not in hardcover."
4,"Good, nothing special.","This book would best be considered filler. As always it is well written and hints of things to come. I would recommend reading this only to those who enjoy the writing style of L.E. Modesitt Jr., or specifically the Recluce novels. I find no indication that this is anything other than a stand alone novel. Maybe I would be more excited if this was the first novel in a new trilogy but there is indication that it is."
1,A Snooze,"Set in Cape Cod, Rose Connors's series features attorney Marty Nickerson and her lover Harry Madigan. In the third outing of the series, Harry asks Marty to take on the murder defense of his law school lover of twenty -five years ago.One of Rose Connors strengths is characterization. They are real in a fascinating larger than life kind of way. It is fun to read about them. The weakness in this book was the plot. It was not suspenseful at all and really made the book drag through three-quarters of the book. I really wanted to like it, but in the end it just seemed boring."
5,Lots to Learn,"This is my first digital camera. The basics are easy to learn and simple to master. However, the Coolpix has so many capabilities, it may be months before I get to most of them. I did try to get it to download wirelessly initially, but was unable to master that, but with the included wire, it was a very easy download. Perhaps after using it for awhile, and re-reading the manual, I'll figure it out.I bought an extra battery to have when shooting many pictures at an event, but I have as yet to need it. The battery lasts a long time, even when shooting all pix with a flash. It does take a couple seconds to recover from the flash, but it seems good/acceptable to me. I have never yet needed a second battery even when taking 50+ pictues. One suggestion, though would be a way to see the level of battery charge.You definitely need a memory card. The camera is only good for about a dozen pictures or so without one.Overall, I'm very satisfied and look forward to learning much from my new Coolpix"
3,hidden costs,"Where I am happy with the camera itself....The actual cost, once I received the final total, I am not happy with. The purchase cost was $257., after shipping, exchange rate, AND customs fees(which were not disclosed at the time of purchase, and delayed the shipping) the actual total was $359.48. I could have purchased the camera locally for $325. What was the point of buying from Amazon??????"
5,Bacteria versus Fungus,"I use this in my seed starting soil mix, to prevent harmful soil fungus in damp conditions of seed starting. I like the idea of bacteria and fungus having an epic battle in the soil. Targeted to destroy only ""bad"" fungus, not the beneficial kind. Seems to work fine.One more thing: This stuff may be organic, but it is seriously smelly and gross. I'm also checking out Actinovate, which isn't so smelly and gross, and a product called Rootshield."
3,Not Much Wonder Here.,"This rather simple Christmas drama revolves around a family of four on the night of the birth of Jesus. The father, Eliab, is a devout student of the scriptures, but fails to see them fulfilled before his eyes. His wife understands what he can not. Their son, Abner, is thinking of revolting against the Romans and his sister, Miriam, appears too much like an American teenager.The play tries to illuminate some of the wonder of Jesus' birth, but is written in such an ordinary way, that it captures very little excitement at all, let alone any wonder. Nevertheless, for a small cast to perform around Christmas, with not too much work, it works okay."
3,Choose carefully,"I loved the socks. I loved the technique. However, I would like more sizing information. Almost all the of instructions in the book are for one size of socks - with a couple of other sizes. Since it was a sock book, it would have been helpful to have a variety of sizes in the instructions - or, at least, a conversion chart in the back of the book correlated to shoe size. If you are not that size, you must re-size the pattern. Also, the back cover showed a pair of miniature socks. But the instructions for them were not in included in the book. :-("
2,Not for the visual learner,"I love this technique of making socks, but my advice is to go to a local yarn shop and ask about lessons rather than buy this book. This books is NOT for the visual learner. The photos (just two pages) do not illustrate the process and are poor quality.One page is helpful and that is how to adapt any traditional sock pattern into this technique. Save your money and purchase yarn."
1,"Not worth it, but here's the one that so is...","Working socks on two circular needles is great for socks. But this book does nothing to help the person who wants to be able to create socks for multiple sizes and then experiment with design and needle size or yarn or just want to do more than the few patterns in the book.So I suggestSensational Knitted SocksThis book is incredible. You can use the same pattern to knit on 4 DP needles, 5 DP needles, and 2 Circular needles. All the instructions are clear and concise. Plus the book allows you to make 1000's of different types of styles of socks. Combine different patterns to get great socks and challenging projects."
2,Not for the beginner - maybe intermediate knitter,"This book is for advanced knitters only.I found that Antje Gillingham book,Knitting Circles Around Socks: Knit Two at a Time on Circular Needleswas much friendlier for the novice knitter, as she doesn't expect you to go and buy several other books to explain and illustrate some concepts that only took a couple of pages. Gillingham's book was well worth the extra $1.50 to me.BTW, Cat Borhdi's book is only 44 pages - they must be counting the covers as 4 pages to bring the total to 48."
1,Totally Overated,"I just started knitting socks and love being able to start and finish a project within a short period of time. I also love knitting in the round, so when I so this book, I thought it was the perfect solution. The positive reviews also helped. I was disappointed by the sock patterns offered and and while the pictures were clearly photographed, I was expecting a bit more. I tend to collect books, but I returned this one the same day I received it. I found the sock patterns offered just a little too ""Bohemian"" and would have welcomed more information on adapting patterns to fit different size feet."
2,"Not enough info, and too basic!","This book provided information about how to increase your self esteem as a woman, thus increasing your desirability in the bedroom. It did not, unfortunately, give the down and dirty facts about seduction. The author entices us with hints about her many sexual romps with men, but then never really delivers the goods regarding the real details that I was looking for. This book was published in 1998 and quite frankly much of the information is also out of date."
5,I can't wait for more!,I've already given a review for the first book which is on this page for some reason... so I wholeheartedly agree that the book on Asia and the Pacific is just as spectacular as the book on the Americas... It was out of print and I was amazed when Amazon.Com came through with a used copy that was in beautiful condition! I was very pleased and impressed and am delighted to have this book in my collection... I was very intrigued by the families in Asia and the exotic Pacific! Very much worth the wait!
2,Had potential,"To make a long review short. A guy inherits his Uncles house, but doensnt inherit the money as he spent it all on a stripper/club So Reno has no money to pay for the house, that is when they take in roomies. Some flirting going on between Holly and the male roomate...or so thats how it appears to us.Toward the end Holly has a 3some with both rommies while Reno is gone, however it didnt make sense, because throughout the film she didnt like nor spent much time with the female Roomie. She arrived to a house party and was furious, she walks into her room and there they both are and as the screen goes black she is heard yelling at them to get out of her room, seconds later shes in bed with them. How does that make sense? I just felt that Reno was too serious throughout the film and seems boring. The film overall was not that entertaining."
2,The Wraith,"The car in the movie was cool, but that was about it. The script was immensely lacking. The acting wasn't that good either."
4,"detailed descriptions of corruption, not written polemically","This book detailes the corruption of not only the Clintons but Arkansas and Washington D.C. as well. The book paints a picture of the idealistic and somewhat tortured personal lives of two people who get caught up in the corruption of not only Arkansas, but Washington D.C. The book does get kind of bogged down in discussing tangents to the main theme of the book, the Clintons, but its meant to show what kind of Arkansas and Washington D.C. they came into politically. The book, although defintely not pro-Clintons, avoids purely polemical and emotional language and writing. It is a sad commentary on politics in general and our country when corrupt people can get into high places."
3,"Better than a PC, but not great.","As a computer novice and recent Mac convert I was dissapointed in the fact that this product is not as user friendly as it would appear in their advertisements. It can be almost as frustrating as trying to figure things out on a PC. What I do like about this product: looks great, it's compact (the CPU is built into the display), and it's fast. If you are thinking about making the switch from a PC you may want to go to one of the Apple stores and do a test drive first. One last thing, if you are comfortable using a PC mouse, then get ready for some frustration, as this one takes some getting used to."
4,A Cult Classic for Good Reason,This sadly short-lived animated series is as much fun as the Sam and Max comics and video games. A must for all fans of the freelance police.
4,One of the best soft rock albums ever,"In a time when tons of women were making similar style songs, Paula Cole put herself in the position of the best of a very good group (Jewel, Sarah MacLahan, etc.)"
2,Not so hot,"High hopes based on the reviews; disappointed but thought it might get better with repeated listening. Nope. While Cole has a great voice and talent, there is too much contrived emoting translated into screaming. Donated to the local library with hope that someone else will find in it what I did not."
2,where have all the good songs gone?,"""Carmen"" is great. ""Where have all the cowboys gone"" is great. ""Hush hush hush"" is great, too. The rest: Don't bother ... And if you're looking for ""Mississippi"", buy the Lilith Fair CD instead."
2,This CD pretty much STINKS!,"I baught this Cd hoping that her other songs would be just as great as, ""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?"" ""I Don't Wanna Wait,"" and ""ME."" Well guess what I was wrong! Out of the 11 songs, there were two others that were pretty good, including ""hush, hush, hush"" with Peter Gabriel, and ""Feelin' love."" Her songs are loud, angry and very annoying. I wasted my money on this stupid CD! I would have given it one star, but I liked the two other songs. You can buy this CD if you are a Meridith Brooks and Alanis Morissette fan, otherwise don't say I didn't worn ya!"
3,"A little bit dissapointing, but she is still on time.","People who was charmed by ""Harbinger"", and saw Paula Cole as the only right folower of Joni Mitchel, Sinead O'Connor or Tori Amos, may be going to be a little bit dissapointing with this record, which seems to be more commercial. Neverthless not all is lost; Paula still keeps her particular style in songs like ""Tiger"", ""Throwing Stones"", ""Mississippi"", ""Nietche's Eyes"" ant the Peter-Gabriel-with duo ""Hush Hush Hush"". She also deserves a chance, because it is her first self-produced record and she plays all her instruments. I think the better could come, but it's Paula herself who has the last word to say."
2,"Self-absorbed, over-produced, underwhelming.","The hits on this album are catchy, but overall the album doesn't deliver enough musical or lyrical depth to inspire repeated listening."
1,Pitiful,"Paula Cole tries to sing like a songbird but she comes across as a whiny, snively woman who has nothing better to do. She is a good, quality songwriter and musician, but singing lessons are a must."
1,Who signed this crap ?,"Paula Cole is just another so-called ""artist"" in the long assembly line of those ""Lilith Fair"" types where by simply being female gives her some sort of artisitc ""credibility"". But really this music is for coffee-shop dwelling, urbane, veggie-burger eating feminists. I have to admit though that the cut ""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone"" is mildly clever, but I like it in a novelty sense. It is the quinetssential '90's PC, man-bashing song. Music like this makes me wish the '90s would just simply end !"
4,This writer is funny!,"A friend of mine told me about Cara Colter's writing, and recommended I take a break from the more ""adult"" romantic fare I generally choose, ie Superromance, Harlequin American. Well, I'm very glad I took my friend's advice and gave Ms. Colter a chance. First off, she can really write! She's funny and warm and very articulate. The hero's a (sensitive)hunk, the heroine's cute, lively and independent, and the writer's insight into and deft handling of small children in this book is nothing short of wonderful. I wouldn't want a steady diet of these so-called sweet romances, but will definitely be looking for this writer in the future, as well as searching the used bookstores for copies of the numerous books she wrote for Harlequin under the name Quinn Wilder."
5,cage cover,This cover helps my bird sleep at night he use to cry all night no matter what I covered his cage with he would not go to sleep but now he sleeps all night longand he is happy in the morring.This cover works. Everyone who has a bird should get this cage cover they will love it like I do
4,it is a cheap very thin walled plastic fish bowl,"In my case i was looking for a very cheap, thin walled, plastic, fish bowl. So this was exactly what I wanted. The seller never claimed that this was some high end product. The price does not support this being a high end product. There is a seam that runs around the middle of the bowl from the manufacturing process, but sits flat. This is a small tank, it is only about 5.5"" tall 3.5"" across its narrow side, and about 5.5"" wide."
4,It works and is cute,"I'm not sure what a booster like this is supposed to accomplish. It raises my child up a few inches and that's about it. There is no security strap or harnessing apparatus to attach the chair to the seat in the car. There is a little black strap that attaches to the seat belt behind the child's shoulder...not sure what that's for. The instruction manual showed how to install the strap, but didn't say what it's for. I assume it's to keep the seat belt off the child's neck, but it's quite a feeble attempt and not really worth the hassle of using it. The fabric is cute and I haven't tried to clean it yet."
5,Graphic SF Reader,"An excellent atmospheric Hellboy romp, as usual. For a concept or even character design when you first see it, somehow it works. It looks ridiculous, sounds like it would be silly, but it is not. Hellboy is exactly the kind of guy you would love to buy a beer for (hopefully out of range of any monsters). Mignola's style just fits."
5,Rock Spectacle,Rock Spectacle (Rock Spe-TAK) is one of the best samples that BNL has to offer because it's a live CD and Live Shows are their strength. The added features are awesome and fun to watch. Go! Buy! If you're a real fan you will love this CD.
5,This CD will Rock Your face OFF,"Where have these guys been?...Living in a basement on the other side of Egypt? I think not but these Guys completely have their act together, They Rock,Rock ,Rock. They blend a wide array of influences together and end up with some of the best music I have experienced in the last couple years. They go against the grain and prove they are here to stay."
4,Very good...,"Though not all the songs are memorable, there are enough winners (""Brian Wilson"", ""Straw Hat..."", ""Jane"", ""Hello City"", ""The Old Apartment"") to justify the purchase. The live recording of ""If I Had $1000000"" is alone worth the price of admission. Check it out!"
5,Unbelievably Good!,"This is one of BNL's best. First, it is great quality. You can hear all of the instruments and vocals nice and clearly. Also, the band sounds great! Steve and Ed's vocals are fanominal, as well as all the instruments. Another thing is the great song selection. Love it!"
4,Better live,"Good album, but they are amazing live. I saw them in North Carolina last year. It may be one of my favorite concerts. It helped that emmet swimming opened up. Anyone who likes BNL should check out emmet swimming too. I think that they have played alot of show together."
4,Excellent Lyrics! Very moving!,His unique style and abandonment from the mainstream makes John Cox one of my favorite Christian artists.
4,"Easy, pretty,but just short of 5 stars.","Mandrake Linux has always been one of the best companies making a Linux-for-the-desktop solution. Their previous 8.2 edition is a living legend among linux desktop users. In this new installment, they have gone over 8.2, redefined a lot of stuff, made Linux configuration even easier, and created a beautiful unifying interface: Galaxy. The package selection is _very_ broad, and it offers you to update the system upon install, so you keep ahead of bugs. The problem (which you might not notice, depending on the upgrades) is the release was just a bit hurried. An extra week/month of detail/polishing would have done miracles.All in all, Mandrake leaves XP standing with its superior interfase, choice of software, stability and ease/depth of configuration. An excellent choice, possibly only surpassed by the upcoming 9.2 edition."
2,"Amazing, except for the food dye","This is a terrific product, I actually notice a difference in appearance when I use it unlike so many other pricey beauty products. I am disappointed though that it contains Yellow 6 a petroleum based dye that has a number of potential health concerns. I would be happier to trade off the bright, cheery color for the peace of mind of knowing I was not slathering a possible carcinogen on my face. Yuk."
5,Stedman PS101 Lighter Test,Length:: 0:50 MinsA test of the Stedman PS101 using a lighter and my lungs. The PS101 works better than you'd imagine a pop filter could!
1,Wireless Mic Clip,"Musician's Friend is a top notch company, but do not, I repeat, do not buy this mic clip. If you have the type of mic with the battery in the handle, it will be too big for this clip. Further, it is not very flexible, and the plastic, although very tough and unyeilding, may damage the finish on the mic. I could not use it, and it is not worth the hassle to return it."
5,A New Love for Kate--Maybe,"Johnny Morgan, her dead lover's son has adopted Kate. He refuses to live either with his mother or his grandparents in Arizona. Kate knows there will be legal fees before she is granted custody of the 14 year-old and she will not touch the college fund Jack left in her control.She takes a job as a security guard for a promising senatorial candidate and must solve not only current murders, but one from the early days of Alaskan history. Trooper Jim Chopin and an old love awake an interest in Kate, which she thought died with Jack Morgan.The past does not died, but lives to haunt the present for family and friends who create the future of Alaska.A fine addition is THE SINGING OF THE DEAD to the outstanding series by Dana Stabenow.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
4,Another good read,Another good weekend spent in Alaska with long-time friends. I just hope that Stabenow never stops writing this wonderful series.
1,bad item,This unit did not work . It seems to take pictures but there are none on it when hooked to computer . It will take picture when hooked to computer but thats it. I would not recomend it to anyone. And the items description is not for this unit.
5,Amazing Compilation,"Got this because i knew a few of the artists and thought i would give it a shot. It has been over a year now and this CD is still number one in my playlist. And there is not a bad track in the bunch. It is one amazing gem after another - from Warren's Soulshine, through Dar Williams to Martin Sexton's Hallelujah - ""does Satan wear a suit and tie, does he work at the Dairy Queen, does he listen to rock and roll, does he feed the mean."" I have referred this CD to more people than any other CD I've ever owned."
4,directons POOR,"THE ONLY REASON THIS IS NOT RATED 5 is THE DIRECTIONS STINK NO MENTION IS MADE OF THE SPICE PACK, THE FIRST TIME I USED IT I MISSED THE PACKET. I LET SOMEONE ELSE USE MY KITCHEN AND THEY ALSO MISSED IT. The product is great"
2,Avoid if you intend to travel by car,"This book assumes from the beginning that you'll be traveling by train. Unfortunately, it doesn't bother to mention that fact anywhere on the cover or in the intro. You obviously realize it when you start reading it, but in my case it was already too late. It is one of the bigger guides on Sweden available though, and if you'll be traveling by rail, and don't mind complete lack of pictures, this guide's for you."
5,"Challenging, but worth the effort!","Hi; This is a book with a few simple bill-folds, but most are very complex. It's for advanced folders, and even then sometimes it takes a few tries to figure out how the fold developes by looking at the picture. (There is very little text) I have found that the best way to learn this kind of fold is to find some large money, perhaps at a novelty store, or else cut some plain white paper in the proportions of a dollar bill. Follow the directions using the larger paper makes some of the more difficult folds that Montroll uses easier to do. I often fold a bill into the starfish (one of the easier folds in this book) and leave it for a tip in a resturant.Jim"
5,Slingbox AV,This is an awesome product. Now I never miss a game when I travel. Works great w/ Palm Treo 700wx.
4,Great little device,"I bought the Slingbox AV after seeing a colleague using one...and it is really a handy thing to have around. It does exactly what it says it does, is easy to set up (once you figure out any firewall/port issues), and easy to connect to."
5,Slingbox AV is awesome,"Slingbox AV works great on a home WIFI network the quality of the image and sound is excellent. Implementation was very easy.I've accessed the slingbox AV hosted in Ohio, from Argentina and Netherlands and it's worked great over the internet as long as you have a decent internet connection.I highly recommend the device if you want to placeshift your TV signal."
4,This is the best Buy!,"Slingbox AV is the best buy with considering its price, function, body size and easy setting, but you must have some knowledge at least about router setting if you are using a router for your home network."
1,A Disappointment,"I was looking forward to using this device. First I had to spend a day with my ISP provider to switch my IP address from a dynamic IP to a static IP address which was a lot of fun. After doing this I spent two hours with one of the Slingbox technicians trying to get it to work, we got close but were never able to do the last step of installation. Finally we had to give up as we were both tired from spending two more hours on the phone.I wanted to get it set-up before I went to South America so I could watch football, unfortunately this was not possible."
5,"got mine mid 2008, and its still running like a champ","seems customer satisfaction has gone down with newer slingbox models--perhaps because they break down in under 2 years? i dont know. i still have the original av model i bought in 2008 and have it turned on 24/7. no problems so far. using s-video over composite is a must! no hd inputs, but the video quality is good enough for me, even when displaying hd video. i highly recommend manually adjusting the video bit rate (as opposed to having it done automatically). i was able to more than double my bit rate--the automatic setting was not even close to taking full advantage of my upload speeds. if your isp estimates speeds in mb/megabits, just multiple by 1024 to get the kbps you will want to set it to."
3,Sling Media Slingbox AV ( SB240-100 ),"I have owned this for several weeks now but still can't use it outside the house. Works fine on LAN but WAN, I can't seem to get it to work. Very frustrating. I have even hired a guru to come in but didn't solve the problem."
3,My grandson likes to play on it,It is to small to really play on it. It needs to be about a foot bigger each direction. I would have been willing to pay a little more for a better experience.
5,interesting and informative,"I am Catholic and love my faith. Many people have been trying to ""save my soul"" by getting me to leave my faith. Wanting to arm myself against their attacks and criticism, I bought this book. It explains why Catholics believe what we believe and do what we do. It doesn't criticize evangelicals or fundamentalists, but it explains what they believe about Catholics. It is interesting, quick to read, and gave me even greater commitment to my faith as well as the ability to defend it. My sincere thanks to the author."
1,poor and poorer!,"currie is selling an autobiography and that's ok i just wish this book was listed under autos and not catholicism as this is more of a journey of a person trying to fit in in life in general vs. a spiritual journey and then finding catholicism currie says his ""born again catholicism"" is not an act of rebellion but he does't say what it is an act of (finding truth, realizing past errors etc.) ok as bio not as conversion bio as answers no quesions readers may have the biggest WHY?"
5,Well done,The book started off a little slow and I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters. It picked up quickly after that and each chapter had me on the edge of my seat. I only wish that it was a series.
2,Kindle version,"Had high hopes for this one...The writing was maybe a bit stilted in places, but the ideas and characters were at least interesting. I gave up a couple of chapters in, though. It seems like the Kindle version might have been OCR scanned, because there were a pretty fair number of typos and formatting issues. The typos were sometimes bad enough that you actually had to stop and step out of the story while you figured out what the sentence was supposed to say.Overall, the Kindle version was bad enough that I couldnt enjoy the book, and I ended up putting it down and starting another book. I'd say, if the book seems interesting to you, consider it in paperback instead."
5,Buy this book.Its good,"I just finsished this book a few days ago, and i loved it. especially the ending.So if you want to know what this great ending is, go out and get your own copy.Now.This is an awsome novel and i think anyone who can read will like it."
4,You must assemble this item,Before purchasing this item I read all of the product description and did not read that some assembly was required. My only problem was that I had to have someone come in to put it together for me.It was delivered in a timely manner and the box placed in my home.It is beautiful and everything fits nicely.The free shipping was a big plus.I would purchase from this vender again.
5,Nice -n- sturdy Credenza,"Got it yesterday and put it together - the product description is lacking in that the credenza is a mix of MDF, Wood and Wood veneer. The solid wood components are the door frames, legs and horizontal braces. Sides and top are a handsome walnut veneer and the bottom, inside dividers and shelf's are MDF. In any case, it took me about 2 hours to put it together and all parts fit together exceptionally well. Although the directions don't say it - I added a touch of glue to the dowels to ensure stability. I shopped around a bunch to include local furniture and department stores along with internet merchants and for the price - this is a great deal and stands up well to the competition that is priced at $600 to $700 for similar units. The Techcraft Credenza is well designed, suprisingly heavy with good looking wood veneer and looks like it will hold up for the long run. I would recommend this unit to all! RMJII"
3,wow...,i can't get past a stage... and every time i try i die and then i have 2 start all over again... i know i should plan ahead...
5,Great Game,"This is one of my favorite games, especially to come out in the past few years. The gameplay is very similar to the old beat-em-up games, but with a lot of strategy needed to actually be any good. The art work is unique and very well done, with each character and background having large amounts of detail. The story is also unique and very well done, with a lot of Norse mythology thrown in for good measure.If you've ever played and enjoyed Legend Of Mana for the PS1, you'll like this. Similar fighting system, several interwoven smaller plots, and an emphasis on hand drawn artwork. The only flaw with this game is the slowdown during one particular fight, it's irritating but easily overlooked."
4,great game,"this game is great for all RPG fan, the only downside is that it sometimes lag during boss fight."
4,Beautiful game with one huge flaw...,"To start off, I'd like to say that I loved Odin Sphere. I searched all over my town for a copy of the game and I was elated when I finally got my hands on one. When I first started up my game, I instantly fell in love with it, and enjoyed every moment...until Cornelius' storyline. In his storyline, the boss fights are great and there are enemies everywhere which happens to be the reason this game can't get five stars. The slowdown is AGONIZING. There was one particular boss fight that involves a dragon that spits out trash and sucks it back up. This fight was the reason that I gave up on the game and traded it back in, it is THAT BAD. I recommend that if you plan to buy this game, either get a PS3 or a boatload of patience, because you will need it. Otherwise, the game is great. The story is very intriguing, the characters are deep, and the music is wonderful. If you can deal with the excrutiating slowdown, I recommend giving this game a chance."
1,dissappointed,bad kerosene odor very dissappointed thats all i have to say.they ask me to rate this item it gets no stars but it will not submit my review unless i give it something so i will give it one star but it does not deserve it
1,Smells Bad,"I have had several kerosene heaters over many years. I had looked for the same brand I had always used, but couldn't find it. That company no longer sells in the U.S. due to excessive lawsuits.I figured this newer brand would work well, and was disappointed to find that it gave off a very strong and bothersome odor when on. I have had enough experience to know how to deal with that problem generally, but nothing worked, including having followed the several procedures shown in the manual.I may have just gotten a ""bad"" heater, one in which the combustion wasn't taking place right or was otherwise off, but my experience was bad enough that I returned the heater.Craig"
2,NOT A GREAT PRICE,Found a much better price with higher quality sweatshirts at ecrater.com. It was the BIGBOYZTOYS store at eCrater. There sweatshirts were made by Steve & Barry's Outfitters and are Officially Licensed.Very happy with their Sweatshirts and delivery was fast.[...]
4,Audiovox XM XMFM1 FM Direct Adapter -worth it,"Bought this for wife's 2006 H3 because the XM direct RF car transmitter that comes with the Onyx didn't work well at all. After getting the Audiovox XM XMFM1 FM Direct Adapter I also purchased a GM antena adapter to go with it. I did have to take the radio out which wasn't to hard(I looked it up online to make it easier)I then hooked in all the connections, 1 to back of Radio other to the antena,and 1 to the XM dock.Put some electical tape around the antena adaptor and radio connections to make sure they don't come loose. Once all is back together I tried it out and it worked great.Basically it puts a hard wired signal from your XM radio directly into the car antena instead of relying on the XM's RF transmitter which does it through the air. I didn't use the hardwired 12v plug that came with it."
5,Wish I'd know about this 3 years ago,"Two problems solved in one afternoon !No more searching for clean FM channels as I approach a big city, stations can no longer override the XM reception.Better reception, I can put the XM antenna on top of roof instead of on hood near the truck's FM antenna.Installation is easy IF you can get to your FM radio's wiring. Otherwise yes, you may need to pay a pro to do it. For under $5 you can get incredibly detailed model-specific instructions on getting at the radio ... [...].Toyota pickups use standard antenna jacks so didn't require any extra adapters."
3,"Party Cloudy, Chance of Showers.......","This disk falls just a bit short of it's legacy. Still maintaining their style, 'Moonbathing...' evokes emotion (and a need for pot) with its mystical and haunting sound as it swoons, dives, and cries (still)like nothing else on the music shelf. Though, not nearly as powerful as 'This Timeless Turning', 'Moonbathing...' can still produce the perfect ambience when the clouds come to town and you need a little something to go well with those new mood candles from Cost Plus. I think more of the angelic howls of Anisa would have pulled this album higher to the heavens. Enjoy it, and hang in there until the next album. For those of you just trying to get a feel for SCM, take some Jefferson Airplane and give a couple shakes of classic Floyd. If you're looking for something mature in this contemporary world of mundane distortion and really bad fashion, you still can't go wrong with Skies Cries Mary. New Music for a new kind of human. GZi"
1,This book was terrible,"This book got one star because they do not allow any less. My daughter received this book as a gift. It must be the only one that has sold; I would never have purchased it. The illustration is awful and there is nothing that draws you to want to read on in this book. The section on getting a puppy ought to make some parents really happy when they cannot afford one or live an apartment and cannot keep one. Setting the child into the mode that they should have one. Let's hope that this new era of singers and actresses writing books comes to an end. I recently saw that Jamie Lee Curtis also wrote a book the illustrations in that book were terrible too, hope the story is better, as I did not have the heart or maybe stomach to read it."
5,wonderful,"This is the clearest, most comfortable bluetooth headset that I have used. It is clearer than my cell phone by itself. I highly recommend it."
2,not impressed,"The support isnt realy what I had expected, and it makes my chest look flat. I'm actually kind of disappointed.It also seems I shouldve went a size smaller. Im really just not happy with this product I have regular tank tops that have more support than this."
2,Just OK.,"I purchased this camisole to wear under a strapless dress, and it didn't work out quite as well as I'd hoped. First of all, it doesn't have any sort of grip that would keep it from slipping down your body... I worried about that the entire evening I wore it. Secondly, the ""suck-you-in"" factor is low... don't expect to look any more shapely with this garment... smoother yes, more shapely, no.Also, the fabric is kind of slick and my strapless dress ended up sort of slipping down (it was a jersey knit dress)! I was lucky my dress and the camisole were both black, because otherwise it could have been very embarrassing! Last, I also want to mention that this camisole is somewhat like a sports bra in that you get sort of a squashed uniboob look... not too attractive!"
4,Great book,"For those interested in the great illustrators/artists Diane and Leo Dillon, this book is a great find. I looked for what felt like ages to find a copy that wasn't $100 + and finally found it on Amazon. There is a good bit of detail of their lives for which I was glad to discover but I was hoping for some prints of their work on the Wise Child series-Silly of me since that series was published after this work."
3,Let's super relax with sugar water,"this is a maxi-single of the song ""Sugar Water"" (one of the stronger tracks from their ""Viva! La Woman"" album. there are some cover songs on here as well as a live track and some remixes. some good moments here and there but nothing too fantastic. i like the ""Aguas de Marco"" cover."
1,Not Pleased,"The video is not coherent. First, the sound quality is horrible with street noise or other noise making it almost impossible to hear. Second, the Irish accent adopted by the narrator is not understandable in many parts. Also, it starts in Paris and not Dublin as the title suggests.More importantly, there is no logic to the material presented."
2,"Educational, and you know what THAT means","I knew that this wasn't going to be an 'edge of your seat' type of video, but even I was surprised at the slow pace and dubious production values. You REALLY have to love Ireland to appreciate this video and for most, the glimpses of the lovely Irish countryside and the soft Irish accents won't be enough to counter the 'watching paint dry' affect. If you're interested in agricultural machinery/rural existence this video MAY be for you.It might give you some ideas, even! But it is plodding, and is not a sophisticated production by any means. I don't feel cheated, and it is educational in its way. But I probably would not have purchased if I had had a preview. Recommended to farmers and wool-spinners."
5,Virtua Tennis 3,"This is a pretty fun game. I beat it in about 3 days after playing the first day and then getting instantly hooked. There is one gripe about the game though, you constantly play the same opponents. Ranked 300 in the world you play Andy Roddick and you play him again ranked 15 or so. Of course he is much harder when you're ranked 15 or so but that aspect makes it unreal. Other then that its a very good buy."
5,Fantastic! Rod Stewart still has it after all these years!,I started listening to Rod Stewart about 25 years ago and I am thrilled that he has released this CD with this great new material.
1,Haven't gotten it yet,"As of today I haven't gotten the CD, they are sending out a replacement. I have had to ask if they could give me a time when to expect it and they will not give me a tracking number or anytime when to see it come. I have worked in the shipping business and know that you can have a time once something has been shipped to know pretty close to when you should get it. This is the second time that I haven't gotten what I have ordered through Amazon, it will be hard for me to try ordering anything thing through your company again.Joan"
3,"Good, but could use some work","Rod Stewart has alway been a heckuva singer and his huskey-voiced melodies always seem to penetrate the heart and soul. While Rod does a pretty good job with the compilation,it does not live up to its potential. Rod covers at least two previously recorded songs such as ""So Far Away"" and ""Sometines When We Touch"" and unfortunately gives an awkward rendition of the latter (sorry Rod but Dan Hill is the man when it comes to that song). There are some classic Stewart tunes like ""Downtown Train"" and ""I Don't Want to Talk About It"" that more then make up for the lowpoints on the CD, but I for one was looking forward to ""Forver Young"" only to be treated to the new-updated version instead. A good song for sure, but best left in the 80's. Overall, good job Rod"
5,rod stewart ballads,I'm not a major fan of Rod Stewart. I mostly enjoy his ballads from the 80s and 90s. This cd is a mix of those hit ballads and some cover songs.Tag: greatest hits
2,ok for the money,"We needed some xtra chess pieces and this fit the bill, however pieces are very lightweight and they were somewhat disappointing in regards to weight and quality. Still, if you just need a few pieces, the price was right."
2,Too light...,"I was disppointed when I got the set. They are lighter than I thought. My son constantly knocked pieces over when he tries to move a piece. Later I bought a set from Walmart for a cheaper price, which also include a foldable board and set of checkers. The pieces from Walmart is even heavier than this set. I don't recommend this product."
1,Flimsy and don't hold much,"These report covers are very flimsy and they don't hold much. The product description says they are supposed to hold 1/2 inch of paper. I don't think they hold that much. At least they didn't for me. So they won't work for the purpose that I bought them for.I've used the ACCO Pressboard Report Covers in the past and have been very happy as they hold 3 inches of paper securely. I bought the Avery Report Covers because I couldn't find the ACCO in a package of 10. So, I'm going to keep looking for the ACCO covers."
4,good little companion,"i like this yoga book, its cute, easy to follow, but I have to admit I dont use it on a daily basis, I just like it as a go to for different positions when I feel like pulling out my mat, stretching, being a little active instead of just sitting on the couch. good for beginners/amateur yogis like me."
5,Costello Masterpiece,"Elvis once again knocks it out of the park with his ""Costello & Nieve"" 5 box set. OMG - I have always been a huge fam so I am somewhat biased but, this awesome set is good for any listener. Elvis has great chops and his live performaces are the ""proof of pudding"" (if you know what I mean) This box set is a great value at any price."
5,We love these pops,They are yummy and healthy. I have a daughter who does not eat unhealthy treats and she eats these and loves them. As do the other children.
5,Best tasting lollipop ever,"I just bought them because they were on sale. Definately worth the money. Better then your everyday tootsie pop or dum dum. Plus they were organic, which I don't care too much about, but a definitve plus!"
3,Beware,"The flavors are good, however, the pops come off the sticks. Fortunately I know the Heimlich maneuver because my 5 year old was choking on one that came off almost whole."
5,Refreshing treat,These lollipops are a healthy tasty treat. I enjoy them around the office and at home.
2,Does not come with the amount specified!,"These suckers are yummy BUT it only came with 120 suckers, not 150 as is was supposed to."
3,"""Assorted Flavors"" A Misnomer","I ordered this for my nieces & nephews as a healthier alternative to the high-fructose-corn-syrup--read ""poison-""--laden candy that was on offer for the Halloween season. I was very disappointed, however to discover that the variety was only nominal. Of all the flavors, Watermelon was the most plentiful, overwhelming the rest of the others by a ridiculous margin, actual orders of magnitude! I counted--yes, LITERALLY counted--only 5 pomegranate; 6 sour apple w/ the remaining flavors: grape; lemon; orange; berry; mango; etc, coming in at around plus or minus 2 of those numbers. The candy was a hit w/ my munchkins, it's true, but I felt cheated (and so did they) that there wasn't a better balance of flavors. They got sick of the watermelon fairly quickly and were unhappy to learn that they couldn't all get each flavor. Instead of solving a problem, it created a larger headache for their parents and me. Caviat emptor."
2,Flavors don't appeal to my kids,"I got a batch of these for my children, who love lollipops of all kinds. They disliked every single flavor in the batch. I didn't much care for the flavors either and we ended up throwing them out. Maybe older kids would like these or determined foodies but I'd recommend trying a small batch before investing in a large amount."
1,Beware!,"I've returned two of these bags. Both came in boxes that were previously opened (the original Everlast tape was cut open and retaped with clear packing tape.) The bags were not packed consistantly. Most importantly, what feels like sandbags were placed randomly just under the Nevatear cover. Great cover! However, a few hard punches into packed rags and then a sudden hard shot into sand is unsafe. I'm sure they make a good product, but I'm having a hard time getting one. Gotta move on."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"When I bought this bag it was 50 dollars, and I've gotten about six months worth of use from it - don't know how much longer it's going to last though. About three months into use the bottom seem started tearing, and the side seems near the bottom soon followed. Now the bottom half of the bag is held together with duct tape. The seems holding the straps to the top are also starting to break, and the metal clip that holds the bag to the ceiling is made of low quality steel that has worn down to about 1/2 its original thickness.The filling is uneven and settles to the bottom at an alarming rate - even if taken down, set on its side, and rotated periodically, so striking at high or medium height is like punching marshmallows, while hitting low is like punching a brick wall.For $50 it's been fine, but consider spending more on a higher quality bag. When they say ""Everlast"", they don't really mean it."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I paid $50 with free shipping for the bag.(I wish everyone would make a point to say how much they paid on all their purchases since this makes a world of a difference when reading other user's reviews.)With this said, it does its job.Just like what I expected after some of the review, the top gets soft and bottom gets hard.You get what you paid for."
3,"Arrived late, but looks okay","Received bag about 4 days past expected delivery date, but box showed up in good condition. Packaged inside a box and placed in a box, so i'm confident the contents are good to go. Still waiting for my charges to my account to go through."
3,music and pictures,"This is fine, if it's what you're looking for, but it's not a normal educational program. There is no voice-over at all, just pretty pictures. I love Costa Rica, and I'm no pro with a camera, but it seems to me the locations aren't the best. I haven't compared others of these types of discs (I've been to C.R. many times), so maybe this is as good as it gets, but I've only watched it once, and doubt if I'll watch it again."
2,Other wise good game suffers from bad controls,"I want to like this game, but where it fails however is the controls which are very unresponsive, often I'll move the controller to do some move or another, and absolutely nothing happens. This is a problem for example when trying to do a jump dash over a large gap.The problem of unresponsive controls has cropped up in several Wii games that I've played, so it's not just this game that suffers, but several, and I know it's not just my controller because I've tried others. There are games out there that make a good use of the controller, and work for the most part properly, but I suspect that it's just really hard to make games work right with motion controls."
2,"Poor music, poor story.","The first thing that annoys me of the game is it's music. The game is about the one thousand and one nights arabian stories, and the soundtrack of the game is only one song of rock n' roll (for all the game!!), that has nothing to do with the game and ambientation. It doesn't has any options for changing or turning off the music. I like sonic games, but this one i didn't like."
1,The worst sonic game I've ever played,"Sonic And The Secret Ringsis the worst sonic game in Sonic The Hedgehog history. The game requires you to holdWii Remote Controllersideways, which only complicates things. There is a voice and subtitles informing you where to go and what to do. It says for Sonic to do this or that and when I do, it doesn't work. The controls are horrible and more difficult to deal with than being 20 grand in debt. I can't get past the fourth paragraph/level/stage. I've spent over 2 weeks trying to figure it out. It's the controls. They suck on the game. Maybe if the game was compatible with theWii Classic Controller, it might have been easier to play. I rightfully deserve my 30 bucks plus tax back for this wrongfully made Sonic Game. Whoever composed this game had no clue what they were doing."
3,It's alright!,"This game sounds like it is alright to me. The game is about Sonic and this other girl genie trying to get all of these world rings or something like that and beat this evil genie. A lot of the worlds have like the same level and that is kind of weird because it sounds you are doing the same exact thing like every mission. The music in the game sounds like it is some kind of rock music and stuff. Also, the mini games are hard to understand because it seems like a lot of them are confusing. Some of them it will tell you like how to play and it really doesn't explain it very well sometimes. I would rent this game first before actually thinking about buying it. But, anyway this game sounds ok to me. 3 out of 5 stars"
1,Should not have an E rating,We didn't even get past the opening part. My son is a HUGE fan of sonic. (We have an old genesis system) It was too dark and grim to have an E rating. He loves the Sonic leapster game he received for Christmas but we are very disappointed with the Wii Secret Rings game.
4,Good Not Great,I don't agree with almost all fans that the Shogun vs Henderson main event was the greatest fight ever.It was a really good fight but not the greatest in my opinon. I also feel that Shogun got robbed again and deserved to win the decision on my scorecards. Overall it was a good card from top to bottom; but not a great card.
3,finger curve is too narrow (for me).,"Loved the bottom curve and weight of this slide, but the finger divot was too small/narrow for me (and I'm a girl with thin fingers!). Ordered a lap dawg instead, and it feels MUCH more natural in my hands..."
4,All Natural.... :),"This is my second bottle of Dr. Murray's... I go back and forth between the full dose of 3 tablets twice per day (if my diet has been junky), to mostly just 3 in the evening. Honestly, it's pretty much impossible to tell how effective they are, except that if I forget for a few days, I notice a difference in my nail strength and color...."
4,- collector's purposes only -,"I bought this EP (I wouldn't call it a SINGLE) at Best Buy back in 1995 for $8.99 It is kinda crazy to see that it's fetching $30 on Amazon now. However, if you buy this you will see it is stamped ""collectors edition"". You can tell by the song titles that these are not unreleased tracks or anything. The songs are all duplicated on Slayer's other major releases and there's only 4 of them here. It's just the point of having this EP for keepsake since it's limited edition. Thrash on... - Jay in Texas"
3,...what you pay for,"For $8, this set of cuffs is decent. I could probably break the link with minor effort, but my girlfriend seems to stay pretty well restrained. Not bad..."
2,Beware,The handcuffs that actually came are completely different from the picture. They are those ones with those little levers that double lock the cuffs. I am disappointed because these are not the ones from the picture. They are basically good quality black toycuffs without the little lever that unlocks them. Stick to Smith & Wesson or Peerless.
5,Deduction Maximizer Beta tester review,I was a beta tester for the Mac version of TT Deduction Maxmizer 2006 and I was very impressed even with the beta version. I have since used a released version and can state that specifically my feedback was fixed in the shipping version to my satisfaction. The program is easy to use and pointed out deductions that I wasn't even aware of. Downloading a States Tax version was very easy as well as updating the program with the latest fixes and updated tax information (I used a broadband connection). I highly reccommend this program for the do-it-yourselfer tax prep on a Mac.
1,it wont work,downloaded the program properly without any problems indicated but when I try to start the program I get the error window asking if I want to send the error to microsoft with no further guidance on which way to correct the problem. It has taken longer trying to get it to work than it would have taken to actually complete my taxes.Frustrated! I want a refund.
4,Too Many Updates & Print Issue,Turbo Tax Deluxe installed cleanly on Windows XP Pro with no problems but every time I went to use Turbo Tax there were updates.I was never sure when I should submit my Tax return because maybe in a few days or weeks there would be more updates perhaps affecting what I would owe.An update should be a rare occurrence but with this product it is routine. They need to get it right at time of release.Another irritant is that the Turbo Tax cover letter throws off the print out of the return for those with 2 sided printers. Page 1 of 1040 ends up on on the back of one of Intuit's cover letter pages. The IRS doesn't want to see Intuit's words of wisdom with my return I am sure.In order to avoid this problem it is necessary to save the return as a PDF file then select the proper 1040 Page 1 as the start of printing.
2,Defeatured Product Compared to Previous Years,I've been a loyal user of TurboTax for the last 8 years. This year's version is the worst because Intuit is no longer in the business of making a good product that is simple & complete for an average user.Intuit is indirectly forcing its customers to upgrade to the premier version (for another $30) to get features such as ISO/ESPP which were available as standard before.I think this is the last time I'll be using TT.
2,Easier to prepare myself,"For the past two tax seasons in a row, I have attempted to use Turbo Tax, but ultimately ended up preparing on my own forms. I have finally decided that it just isn't worth the hassle of trying to answer all of the program's questions, which are completely irrelevant to my situation, just to end up being confused by pages and pages and pages of unnecessary addenda. I am an extremely intelligent individual, but this program is too frustrating for me."
3,"Federal stuff is pretty thorough, but the state returns?","The federal return and deduction portion of the program is pretty good, you can access help along every step of the way, and a lot of the jargon is explained. However, the state returns aren't worthwhile. The only help you are provided is the information you can get from the state booklet, for the most part. I'd consider getting the stripped down version."
4,Still gets the job done after all these years.,After probably 10+ years of using this product it still gets the job done. I e-filed my federal and state returns and actually got my state refund direct deposited to my bank account 3 days after it was accepted. I'm still waiting on the federal refund (its been less than 2 weeks). The only complaint I have is I had to use a forum db on the Turbo Tax site to get an answer to a state tax credit I couldn't locate. No emails were answered by Turbo Tax. This is nothing new as this is the way its always been.
5,turbo tax,"I have never done my own taxes before and I was a little apprehensive but this program was very easy. It walked me through everything and it also gave explanations along the way in case you didn't understand what they were asking. There was one thing that I didn't like. I thought it was going to cost me only the $40 for the program and my taxes would be done and that the e-filing was free. I was wrong, it cost me an additional $30 to e-file."
5,Turbo Tax 2007,The product was great. It arrived on time and worked like a charm. I will recommend this software to all my friends. I will also recommend that they buy Turbo Tax from Amazon[..]
4,FAST and SIMPLE,"I have used Turbo for the past 5 years... it is always simple, even to itemize... don't have the form in the background like before, but you can still get to everything. I did my taxes in less than 20 mins."
1,The worst tax preparation software ever!,"I'm an accountant. For once, I thought that I would try a tax software product to do my personal taxes instead of doing them manually. TurboTax had way too many updates to wait for to complete my taxes with their program. I have dail-up internet access, so I had to wait for a updated disk to be mailed to me. In the mean time, I completed my taxes manually, as ususally, in a fraction of the time that I spent on TurboTax!! Also, I came up with $500 more for my refund than TurboTax!!!I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYBODY!!!!! If you are not knowledgable about taxes, than please go to a C.P.A.!"
2,TURBO TAX,"I THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. iT WAS OVER PRICED. bJ'S CLUB SELLLS FOR 29.50, I OVER PAID AT 43.00. Don't over charge.I'll use another source next time"
5,"TURBO TAX - easy to use, safe too","Each year Turbo Tax changes with the times, makes it easier to complete the Income Tax Documents, both Federal & State. I love diving in to see all the nifty new stuff!!! I was an accountant, but its easy enough for anyone to use, INTERVIEW is SUPER helpful. I use it, because it prompts me to look for items I've forgotten to gather with my tax information, deductions that I've missed, or would have without INTERVIEW. TURBO TAX IS A GREAT PROGRAM!!"
5,Talk about changing plot lines...,"This book took me longer to read that any other recently, mostly because every chapter or so everything seem to change - new characters etc..). Lots to digest - thoroughly enjoyable... J"
5,Great for giving to the kids but better to keep for yourself!,"These suckers are yumalicious! We bought 10 pounds of them to pass out on Halloween. We already knew we liked them, sweet and sour fuit yum yum, so we were pleased to pass them out on Halloween. Only we liked them too much......A couple pounds made it out the door and the rest...muahh ahhh ahh, too good to give away!LOVE these suckers, especially the sour apple...and strawberry smash..ohhhh and the wet face watermelon........Can't type...gots to go get me another sucker!"
2,Not interesting to my kids,I love the idea of these but can't sell them to my kids. I know others who like them but I will give them a pass.
3,Not as sweet as they could be,"I bought these after seeing some reviews. I wish I had bought a smaller bag to try first. I tried to give them out at Halloween to get rid of them. They not bad. But after trying the College Farm brand, there's no comparison. The College Fram brand has a much better taste than these do."
1,Organic but NOT allergy-free!!,"I ordered these lollipops because I have numerous food allergies. As with most Amazon food items, it was virtually impossible to figure out what actual ingredients were. I was very excited at the thought of being able to be able to enjoy ""candy"" again though so I went ahead and ordered them. After getting them, I ate a couple the first night and woke up the next morning congested and with a sore throat. I thought nothing of it other than that it was spring-related allergies. I ate a few in the next few days or so though and had the same reaction. I then read the ingredient list and discovered brown rice syrup on it. I am really tired of companies that market themselves as ""organic"" and ""all-natural"" sticking GRAINS into everything! Rice is not good for you - and if you have an intolerance to grains like I do - DO NOT buy these lollipops. I have Celiac disease and my body does better without grains and these lollipops!"
1,concerned,Wanted to know what the ingrients was for the natural flavors because it can be 1500 different toxic things including MSG. Yummy earth refused to answer the question on many attempts. Just another company making us think it is ok for our children when it really is not. If you are concerned email the company and ask them for an exact ingredient list for just one item and see what happens. Just a concerned mom who truely wants to eat organic and not have the wool pulled over my eyes.
4,CD and DVD opener tool,"Great timesaver and inexpensive! Sold in pack of 5 to share with entire family! Color choices too!One quick swipe along an edge and that pesky plastic wrapper is ready to pull off your new CD or DVD.After almost 3 years, tool is still in prime shape and used regularly! Senior citizens especially appreciate it. Also, this tool seems to have NO possibility of causing a cut."
4,I like it,"I bought this for my kids. I remember this cartoon from when I was a kid, and I loved it. I still like it, but my kids are not into it. No accounting for taste, eh?"
1,please weres the real fun what happen to u easy riders?,ok sorry to say this but we dont need no slut puppies in this magazine who dont know nothen about harley bikes... i think easy riders need to look back on there magazines back in the 1980's how they done there work thats what us magazine people want. we do not care for this young punks and young woneebee women on there neither... we want the real stuff. real harley people in here in the mags.... if this keeps on i will stop my mags. from eazy riders and so WILL my friends im speaking alot for people its not me its other folks saying the same thing... come on easy riders ya'll can do better. look at ur 1980's mags. there were hot!!!!!!! come on with the real stuff!!!! FORGET THE YOUNG (women) AND YOUNG PUNKS... WERE WAITING ON U HOPEFULLY YA'LL WILL CHANGE VERY SOON!!!!!
1,PissPoor Service,I purchased a gift subscription 12/2 it is now 2/3 and my gift recipient has yet to receive the first issue. I have written Amazon twice and nothing has happened. Probably the first and last magazine subscription I will ever get from Amazon. If the first issue ever shows up I'll review the magazines content.
5,Immerse yourself in Gwynhwyfar's Camelot,Different perspective of Camelot as told by of Gwynhwyfar. It still is the same basic story of the love triangle and the scheming and treacherous plots of Arthur's son and of some of the other rulers who wanted to seize power and become Emperor.Author paints a vivid picture of sixth century Britain's peoples and country sides. Thebattle scenes put you into the fighting and its' aftermaths. The included map helped the reader visualized the journey that the characters took in order to go to Less Britain.An exceptional read for those who love everything about Camelot and for those who want to enjoy an excellent book that takes one into fantasy and past history. I especially liked how she interrelated the end of Camlann (Camelot) with all the surviving characters.
2,Not Like Description,"I purchased this book to find more activities to do with my toddler. It is mostly cooking receipes. I was very disappointed. Most of the activities mentioned were things you could go to Target and get like water coloring. If you love to cook with your child, this would be a great book for you. If you actually want activities instead of cooking, keep shopping."
4,A good investment if you take the time to read it beforehand.,"The most important part of this book is the introduction, which includes a short list of minimal-prep activities and ready-to-go boxes, all very helpful in quickly getting something, anything, to keep a child busy. I borrowed this book from my local library and found that it was worthy of owning my own copy. This book has many ideas for activities. Some are quick and easy, some require some advance prep, some use items you may already have laying around, some need supplies that you have to purchase from a store, some can be done independently by the child, and some need active parental supervision/help. I appreciate the organization of activities by situation (rainy day, outdoor activity, kitchen), but would also have loved to be able to cross reference them by the above categories... looks like I'll have to sit down with this one for a while, and do my own cross-reference on the page of contents..."
4,Good one,"as a grandma, I've purchased this author's book for toddlers and found it somewhat useful. Enough, that I decided to buy this one for the now pre-schooler. Some good ideas, and it also gives you food for thought how you might enlarge on the idea or change it. Sometimes my old brain just can't think of things to do with the little one, since I have her several afternoons a week, so I'm happy I have the book, tho I wish it were a bit less expensive."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with other reviews who have suggested that the author treats deployment like business trips. Several of the ideas to keep close during separations would work only if the separation were short term, like two months or shorter. I've never been through a two month deployment, and I'm willing to bet that when compared to six month and year long deployments, military families have little problems dealing with such a short separation period.In addition, I found this book to be extremely geared towards children. I do not have children and I doubt that my husband would want to recieve silly art projects from me while overseas. So if you do have children, I would imagine this would be a great resource for creative art projects to show Mom or Dad how much they are missed.In all I found this book to be incredibly disappointing and I would not recommend it to families who are looking for suggestions on how to stay close during normal military deployments or separations."
2,Let me sum it up for you,"Obviously you don't expect much when you pick up a movie like this. This one will live right down to your expectations. This is a really predictable made-for-tv movie. Let me sum up all the kills for you:1. Footage of cgi sharks swimming ridiculously fast.2. A shot of someone swimming in the water.3. A shot of a cgi shark swimming up really close to the camera.4. A brief shot of some red colored water.5. Cut away.That's it. I don't think there's a single shot of a person and a shark together at all in this movie. Just really, really boring."
5,Read the book and hear the drums,"I finished reading this book today, enjoying it right down to the last page. The story deals with the relationship between an old woman of mostly Indian heritage and a young man who stumbles upon her out in the woods, where she has lived alone in a cave for decades, subsisting on what the forest provides and what corn she grows (an important plot element later in the book!) and on her knowledge of native plants and animals. I was so enchanted, both by the plot and by the author's use of Keechie's dialect throughout the book, that I finished the whole book in about four hours. My only complaint is that it ended far too soon. Hey Phil, how about a sequel telling how Brian and his family survive, what they learn and how they manage? I even have a proposed name for book two: ""Yoholo."""
5,The Art of a Continent,"Very informmative text, very easy to read, and understand. With pictures, and text that visually and verbably discribe in detail each object listed. Great number of art objects not available to view without the photographs in this book I am 100% satisfied with this book and will use it as a reference, on an ongoing basis. A must for the collector of African Art."
5,Authentic Immigrant Story,"This is one of the most capturing stories I have read of an immigrant coming to the U.S. It was like hearing the stories told time and time again by my parents and grandparents. I have read it twice, once in high school and again in college. Both times Ernesto Galarza was able to draw me into his journey and allowed me to travel along side him, while experiencing a tremendous journey made by thousands."
3,A Baby Einstein knock off,"I have many Baby Einstein videos which my grandson loved. This is along the same line . My grandkids watch it, but they dont seem to like it as much. It has nice music and scenery though which keeps them entertained. It also teaches. All in all a good product for the money."
3,Big,I got this for my newborn because I like the self-clean feature but even the small opening is way too big to fit in her nose. We're just using the free one from the hospital for now until we can fit this one in her nose.
5,A Must Read for ALL of Us Wanting a Balanced View,"Two Hundred-eighteen women were interviewed over a 3 year period from southern Afghanistan and the refugee villages of Pakistan. While this is a scholarly work, clearly laying out the research methodology, I found it a compelling read for the content as expressed by the women who were interviewed, and the details of their daily lives. We learn how they experience their own situations and lives, their hopes and aspirations, their sources of information, health care, how they view dress codes, how they generate income, what it's like to be a woman alone in their society, and views on so many more topics on interest to us all."
5,Stands up to thousands of listenings,"Doug Martch writes songs within songs, movements of music that bring the listener into a vast soundscape of swirling, chiming guitars, syncopated rythems, and imaginitive lyrics. The core of Built to Spill, a revolving lineup of sorts, has really solidified on PFNO, adding a substantive underpinning that makes them more cohesive than ever. Although Martch's lyrics gets occassionally a bit angsty, it is balanced with his pondorous moments, such as on Randy Described Eternity, where he hypothesizes on forever.With just 8 tracks on the disc, you'd think there was no depth to PFNO, but after each listening, I hear new things. So several years and thousands of listenings later, this album still rules, and easily makes my top 10 of the 90s, and probably top 10 all time."
4,what big studio budgets get you...,"judging their last work as a template to this album is like taking a raw block of marble and setting it next to any of Michellangelo's fantastic sculptures.that's not saying that 'There's nothing wrong with love' (their last album for those not too knowledgeable about the band) is any less beautiful than this album is - they're just different beasts.TNWWL is an indie pop lover's delight - insanely catchy hooks with enough low-fi aesthetics to keep a never-ending smile on your face. PFNO is the viscal opposite - harsher, darker, more abrasive and, here's the kicker - ambient.imagine taking their best 2 minute pop songs and adding about 4 minutes of subdued guitar theatrics on it and you've got 'Perfect From Now On'. it's their answer to the ego-driven prog-rock movement - albeit with a more psychedelic twist.your milage might vary with this record. the genius behind it is undeniable - it's up to you whether to accept it though."
3,It can't help being entertaining. Check the cast and crew,Sorority girl murderer ...makes a deal with the devil thatallows him to escape his physical form during lights out and killothers. A friend with a psychic link is terrorized by the maniac and teams up with a leather bound bad boy to stop him. Pretty good most of the time but the make up effects are something crude and the ending is disappointing. Who would of thought? Look for the average appearences from cast members of Sorority House Massacre sequels and backgrounds for in-jokes. END
5,One Happy Camper,My husband was soooo happy that I found a set to complete the set I bought him for Christmas. He is one happy camper !!!
4,Ear Candy,The boys from the OC are at it again. They are a great band and this DVD is made well.O&A; Party Rock!!
4,"A ""must read"" for those interested","If you're into learning about Therapeutic Touch, this is of course a must read. You'll need to attend a training to really get it though. This is experiential by nature and can only be described in a book, but not taught."
3,A little disapointed,"They work like the desription said they would, but it's too bad they slowly fall down. Wish they'd stay in place while moving around. A bit awkward when you need to use the restroom."
3,One Hit Wonder,"One listen to the cd reminds you why. Limited repertoire but great technique. And, ah, those flashbacks to the early 60's."
5,THE COOKBOOK OF THE DECADE,"THE SUSANNA FOO COOKBOOK IS ONE TRUE MASTERPIECE - A MUST FOR EVERY SERIOUS COOK (BOTH NEW AND EXPERIENCED). I HAVE BEEN COOKING FROM THE BOOK NONSTOP SINCE I BOUGHT IT LAST WINTER. THE RECIPE FOR STIR-FRIED RICE WITH TOMATOES AND BASIL IS WORTH EVERY PENNY OF THE BOOK'S COST. THE RECIPES ARE UNQUESTIONABLY CLEAR AND SIMPLE. THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY EASY TO FIND AT LOCAL SUPERMARKETS AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BOOK SOOOOO WONDERFUL, UNLIKE MOST INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOKS. NEXT TIME WHEN YOU NEED TO ADD A REFRESHING COOKBOOK FOR YOUR KITCHEN OR TO GIVE AWAY AS A GIFT, THIS IS THE ONE! TRUST ME BECAUSE I OWN AN ENORMOUS COLLECTION OF COOKBOOKS (OVER 1000 TITLES). YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED"
4,17 brides and 3 returns,"The west was made by mail order brides.Sarah Plain & Tall Collection [Gold Crown Collector's Edition] is about one such lady.This is the second Kevin Sorbo western I've seen, and I think this is betterthan the first. It is well filmed and very well acted.Dealing with the frontier is not easy even for those brought up on hardship.If you subtract love and friendship. it can break people.Here we have a good and bad outcome and more than one redeemed soul."
5,THE QUIET ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE ERUPTS WITH VIOLENCE,"Ali McGraw (The Winds of War, Love Story) and Billie Whitelaw (Frenzy) star as feuding siblings in a rivalry driven by greed and destined for destruction. A series of bizarre murders by a mysterious killer plunges a remote farming community into terror. Diane Baker (McGraw) is a women possessed with the desire to return to the glamour of the city. Her sister Margaret (Whitelaw) runs the family horsefarm. Diane despises farm life, but can't afford to leave...until she discovers that the farm can be sold for a large sum. When Margaret refuses to comply, Diane begins to fantasize about her death at the hands of the mysterious murderer. She realized the fantasy can easily become reality and carefully plots her sister's demise. But not everything comes out as planned once darkness falls in the woods."
1,This book is based on author's prejudice and racism.,"This book is based on author's prejudice and racism. The ""Tenn-nou"", usually transltaed in English as ""Emperor"", is not a kind of the emperor of ancient China or ancient Roman. Japan was constitutional monarchy country until the end of world war II and ""Tenn-nou"" does not have a right to take part in politics directly. This book is full of prejudice and racism. If you want to read this book, I recommend you to ask a historian about this book is a book of HISTORY or cheap fiction."
2,Math or economics?,"Part of the problem with the book is that it's a first edition. But the other problem is that it's too terse for the average reader. It's a book written for mathematicians, not economists.As I implyed before, simple concepts like WARP are made a mystery by the near endless amount of notation and proofs. I wish someone would explain to me (after thoroughly trying to work problems and understand the book) what any of it has to do with economics.Maybe a joke would illustrate my point better: a simple man told an economist about a current economic phenomenon, immediately after which the economist said, ""That can't possibly be true!"" ""Why not?"" the simple man asked. The mathematician (er, economist) replied, ""Because my model didn't predict that!"""
4,Very complete treatment of the core of microeconomics.,This is an excellent book written at a level which should be understandable to the average first year graduate student in economics. Nearly all important introductory topics in microeconomics are covered (to some degree).
3,"Complete, but not the best one","This book seems to be a very complete review of microeconomics, but there are somewhat not very good with the notation used for some problems and a lack of physical interpretation of the models and problems presented. I also have another book, Varian (link below), that I believe is much better.Microeconomic Analysis, Third Edition"
4,"Big book, but much bigger in its contents","In its coverage and depth, this book needs help from only several other books such as Fudenberg and Tirole's(Game), Freixas and Rochet's(Banking), Tirole's(IO) and Salanie's(Contract) in the standard topics of microeconomic theory.In the meantime, this big book provides relatively unified and consistent core in ""mathematical analysis""-like terms and tones. This may make the students frustrated and bored. Simply, this problem can be fixed in only one way. ""Stand and Be accustomed!""One thing is that we'd better get accustomed to Real Analysis, Functional Analysis, Vector Analysis and the like."
4,Simply Funny!!!!!,"Furinkan high gets a new principal which turns out to be Kunos father who came back from Hawaii. priciple Kuno implements a new dress code that the students are made to follow. The Students and Ranma set out to Get rid of Principle Kuno, But it seems Ranma creates himself a problem when principle Kuno notices his ponytail and goes after Ranma with a razor. If you want to know more you have to purchase the Video. ^_^"
4,Good,"I am a great Ranma 1/2 fan and I think that this is just another great video. It is a lot like all other videos, a new character comes and makes lots of trouble. This is one of the funniest videos I have seen"
5,Excellent documentary about WWII,I have found this DVD set to be an excellent documentary depicting all the events that occured during WWII in the pacific arena. Very thorough and educational while at the same time keeping me interested throughout and wanting more and more.
3,Mediocre,"I side completely with the three-star reviewer who preceded me in December 2008. This is another of those sprawling late Romantic symphonies that are sometimes full of half-formed ideas that never go anywhere. The music is not bad as such, just very underdeveloped or developed in unsatisfying ways. Wetz's other two symphonies are better, but they still come off somewhat as inferior Bruckner wannabes in my estimation, with the No. 3 being a shade superior to the other. None of the three are really anything to write home about."
2,Don't get the paperback edition,"The book is very solid, well organized and quantitative at level that can be used by graduate students or senior undergrad. It explains in detail many important subjects that are scattered in other boos. It is worth the price, however the paperback edition is very poor."
2,infantalizing,The exercises in here are a bit too child-like in my opinion. I think this might be helpful for someone doing art therapy or recreational type groups but its hard to take anything meaningful out of this for use in psychotherapy.
3,"Better than average, High Kicking Kung Fu!","Not bad, both Hwang Jang Lee and John Liu were excellent, especially Liu's kicking style. The fighting is fast paced and more fluid than many kung fu films from the seventies. Some illogical scenes however, which are clearly present just as an excuse for a fight."
1,OK novel ruined by a really bad ending,"i would have given this book three stars but it's hard to believe the author or editors would allow the book to end the way it does. It's especially annoying becuase the author spends the last 75 pages getting the reader ready for a climactic ending but instead, he apparently couldn't come up with anything even remotely interesting and chooses an easy and stupid way out. anyone with any appreciation of gender issues will be annoyed or worse at the stupid end of this book. additionally, the tone of the whole novel is somewhat slow and detached, like the main character."
5,Rated #1 in San Francisco!,"I can not believe this album has gone unnoticed for so long. Superb vocals, great studio mix, fun/hilarious lyrics...the party may begin elsewhere but it's remembered here.damn it, Laurie...please, please...when's the next album?"
2,Art Lover: A Biography of Peggy Guggenheim,I disliked this book . Peggy was not interesting enough to fill such a large book; the author should have edited it to half the length. He included so much trivia about people that only casually touched Peggy's life that it made the book intolerably long. I finally skimmed the book and was generally bored by it. Peggy Guggenheim was not a nice person or an interesting one. Her life did not deserve writing about.
2,too short and has issues,I started playing this game for my 4 year old son. You have to start at the first level and beat all of them before you can go to them whenever you want. I save the game after beating the first few levels and when i went to play again the data was gone. I tried saving numerous times and the data was always lost when the power was shut off. I beat the whole game in about an hour and a half. I gave it to my little boy and he could go to any level he wanted but later on he brought it to me with the power off and the data of course was gone again starting the game over. I went online and many others have experienced the same problem with this game. It was also very short and not really any challenge. This game was a waste of my time and money would not recommend this game at all. I heard the first one was better anyway.
1,Bad Experience Also,"After getting this receiver hooked up and using it for about five hours, it suddenly caught a case of the dreaded 'automatic shutoff' disease. When your receiver does this--shuts off for no apparent reason everytime you turn it on, you're pretty much screwed. It is, apparently, a labor and tech intensive fix. In the process of discovering this I experienced the same customer service hell the other two customers below did. The most you might get out of this outfit is the address of a certified repairshop. Other than that, they are rude and completely useless. Onkyo receivers are great sounding, but on the downside--their north american customer service is non-existant. It's customer dis-service. The sound quality/price difference between Yamaha, Pioneer, and Onkyo isn't large enough to justify Onkyo's existance in the US market given their poor customer service. Buy a Pioner VSX 516 or 816 (or a Yamaha HTR 5930/5940) rather than this, or any other model of Onkyo."
4,For all those who love B type Thrillers !,"This was a nice and suspensful B type Thriller movie that I really enjoyed. If you are into Thrillers in general, and don't mind low budget ones, you'll really like this one.The plot is certainly nothing new; we've seen it all before with such thrillers as ""The Hand that rocks the Cradle"", and the like. But yet the story manages to get exciting every now and then. The acting was really convincing, and I always like to see new faces, which also made this movie likeable.All other things, like picture & sound quality were good to excellent with this DVD. Go and see it if you're into thrillers, because you won't regret it."
5,looks great!,im very happy with my purchase. they are heavy nicely made pieces. they are half the price of the same kind and style i was looking at in stores. i have a small bathroom so they were a def must for me.
2,Mignola and Byrne tell weak stories.....,"The Hellboy stories are an example of post internet era comics which are weak in story and try to sell the concept more on the artwork.But the artwork is awful to look at, I don't know what looks more unstyled, Mignola's concept or Byrne's drawing. Maybe both. Don't let Dark Horse Comics hype fool you, this comic has a smaller audience then you think, and the recent movie was only a moderate success, Very Moderate. I think the weak story is to blame. Then again, I don't think anyone at Dark Horse Comics really knows how to write or read."
4,"Catchy from the get go, pass another Coopers Pale Ale.","Having just returned from a 3 week holiday downunder, I was driven to bring back some You Am I. A quick sound bite from an episode of MTVs Road Rules/Australia made me seek out the music of this band. I made my way to a local record store in Sydney and held up 3 different You Am I cds and asked the clerks ""which one do I want?"" They all pointed to Hourly,Daily. They were not wrong. Check this out and you will find yourself turning your friends on to it as well."
2,broke it with the drumming stick,My 5 yr old used the drumming stick that this came with and in less than 3 hits it was broken through. And he wasn't wacking it super hard either. I ordered another one and threw away the stick. Not he can only use his hand and it's held up fine.
3,Really fun!,This is a really fun game. It is great to play multiplayer and graphics are awsome. A sure rental. Not sure if its worth buying though.
5,Good study bible,"I had been looking for a spanish study bible that had study notes that were strong from an evangelical/dispensational perspective and finally i found it. The leather is of very good quality and the notes give quick simple explanations that are not too difficult to follow and understand, A marriage between the niv study notes and the macarthur study bible notes. Una biblia con notas excelentes de una perspectiva evangelica."
4,roots for kids,Very good. I wish there were more genealogy introductory material for young people. The study of our ancesters and our roots has become more popular in recent years.
2,"Good patterns, but writing is annoying","This book has interesting patterns, but it has been a long while since I've read such an annoying book. The author seems to think she is the best thing to ever happen to the knitting world, and if you removed her extraneous rambling, this would be a rather thin pattern booklet. The photos for the actual moebius cast-on are miniscule, and the instructions are ????--I found better instructions online.So yes, buy it, but maybe split the cost with a friend, or buy and donate to your library."
4,A fun exercise,"I bought this book because I got hooked on the free Moebius' patterns on Cat's website. The book offers many more patterns that promise to be fun to knit. It's fascinating enough that I'll buy the second book as soon as my budget allows. A good book, but you need to be able to learn from reading. This won't teach you visually. Fun."
3,It's okay,I would only recommend these rubber duckies for kids as party gifts and not for adults at a baby shower.
2,She doesn't SING!,"With such a beautiful voice, I just assumed Marina would be singing on this CD. Clearly I didn't pay attention while shopping!!! It's all instrumental music - very nice, but not what I was looking for. Just so you know :)"
5,Imagination Is Thrilling; It Makes Your Knees Go Willie Willie,"The Chilekings by Jessamyn West:When the tables are turned, dear adult folk, and children rule the world, what astonishing behavior results. Is that behavior really all that different from what results of today's Western ""tolerant"" dictators? Teach your children well.In this wonderfully imaginative but chilling science fiction story, you are left to feel what it's like when the world is no longer under your control. As if it ever were! What sights you will see in this novel, what thoughts your heart will hear!I read this novel when I was a beginning college student. I recommend it for the college student -- and the soon-to-be parent!"
2,Does not seem accurate.,"I don't think the reading on this is accurate at all because it doesn't give the correct orientation of my house. I verified this another compass as well. Besides it looks really cheap. Of course for the price I cannot expect anything sophisticated, but it should at least point correctly to North. I would not trust this one to find directions if you need to do so on a hike, camp etc."
4,Great Price,For the features and the durability you can not beat the price. I use this item often in my Geocaching experiences.
2,Not the best compass.,The dial tends to tilt and not level out correctly causing it to stick and take a while to get a correct reading. I wish I just spent the extra money on a military surplus compass.
2,This book is not for your average Joe,I was hoping to find some good information on this condition but the book is just a resource for finding various studies. If you are a student in Medicine this may be great but I would hardly call it a Patient's Sourcebook.
2,"Love the set, but always rusting","We received this set as a wedding shower gift and loved it. Unfortunately after using it for only a month or so it was so badly rusted that I was embarassed to let anyone use them! Took it back to the store to exchange it because we love the look and feel of the set so much and after about a week, it's already rusting again. We are really dissapointed and will have to switch to a different brand. Stainless steel should not have to be scrubbed after every use to remove rust stains."
4,Used for 8 years,"We purchased this set about 8 years ago and have ordered several serving pieces through Amazon. The look is really clean and simple and the weight is substantial. The set has held up nicely though the years. Because it is not the highest grade stainless steel flatware, the user should know that you should not use dishwashing detergent that contains LEMON. Also to keep the knives from getting ""rusty"" marks, keep them separate from items of different metallic makeup in the dishwasher. (We just put cutting knives and such in a separate compartment of the cutlery basket of the dishwasher.) Because of this, we'll only rate it with 4 stars. This set is one that goes well with our light contemporary style and one we have not tired of. Recommend it for everyday use."
5,Great product - just adding to the set we've ha for years.,We're very happy with the set; we've had one set of 8 settings for several years and we needed more so we added another 8. Great choice.
4,"It works, but I need a different format","First, this is a lovely piece, although not my usual genre. Speaking from a troubled sleeper point of view, this works every time. I don't take meds (OTC or otherwise)to sleep...but this works for me consistently. I bought the DVD years ago...my problem is that I only have DVD format in the living room. Make it available to my Kindle, and I can figure out the speaker sitiuation (don't want to sleep with earphones).Sincerely,Sleepless in Olympiahttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065EL7W/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Wiring harness,Super fast service with exact match. Ordered on Friday and was in my mailbox on Monday. Easy instructions for a easy install
3,Eloquent,"The title pretty much says its all. If you cannot guess, Chris Hedges, a divinity student and an accomplished war correspondent, does not think much of war, and thinks a lot about love. Hedges is an eloquent writer, but what he says is entirely predictable, and I often wonder if war is really as simply and clearly destructive as he says it is. Anthony Beevor's books ""Stalingrad"" and ""The Fall of Berlin"" seem to suggest that somehow human beings find normalcy in the most abnormal of situations. I think the book would have been a much better read if it were a personal memoir, rather than just a polemic against war."
3,"War, Peace, and Arms","Author of War is a Force the gives us Meaning, Chris Hedges, is a war correspondent for the New York Times and a graduate of Colgate College and Harvard Divinity School. Hedges' authority and astute perspective on the process of war are fueled by his personal witness of insurgency and warfare in locations such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Gaza, Sudan, Yemen, Bosnia, Turkey, and Iraq. He mixes this experience with references to classic literature to convey a story of war as a culture-distorting force. Hedges' describes this force as the myth of war. All things considered, War is a Force that gives us Meaning presents an interesting look into the effects of war. On its own it is an enjoyable read, but when paired with a piece, like the Man, the State and War by Kenneth Waltz, its value increases. I would recommend this book and its presentation of the effects of war as a valuable supplement to the study of the causes of war."
1,Waste of money!,I too have been to war but this book attempts to indoctrinate the reader is his steeped socialist views is interspersed with anti- isreali reteric that discounts the real facts behind the conflict. I cant believe I continued to read this drivel. What a waste of money!
2,"EDITED VERSION OF ""IN CONCERT"" (AND ""LIVE & IMPROVISED"")","This CD is nothing but a cheaper-priced, edited down version of the 2-discIn Concertset, which in itself is a reissue of the 1991Live & ImprovisedOOP set.The same 2CD set is also available in more pricier imports, but the mastering on all is the same.If you want to enjoy the entire show, you definitely want to obtain the complete version."
1,Meh....,"This game altough it looks great, its gets boring very fast, i got bored of the so called arcades, and versus and everthing, its just not my type of game, you fight and fight and just get enough $ for sunglasses, no story at all.Good: GraphicsBad: Boring, no story, no online, gets very repetitive."
4,"Good, but not great.",This game is good for 19.99. But my biggest complaint is the no joystick support! I don't like using a dpad to play fighters. The graphics are great and gameplay is fun. Fans of series will love this one. If you don't want to spend the 60 for Street Fighter 4 or Soulcalibur 4 this is a top notch choice.
3,"Nice Views, but not much much fun..","The views and some scense are great..The game it self is nice, but its like an upgrade of the old school games..The player control is a bit different than the training but you will get use to it...Enjoy..."
2,"Good 3D fighting game, but not the best","If you want a good fighting game, this game would be you're first choice right? Wrong, Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is the best fighting game on PS3, get that from the PSN for $20, it downloads directly to your ps3 and can then be accessed at any time without any need of a disc."
3,is not a bad game BUT......,"what i didnt like for this game, is that is not Online.. so thats kind of S***T for me..."
2,The way Jesse Mowat is played,This movie has a lot of violence and the profanity is quite bad for kids and teens. This movie is about a little boy who becomes a dengerous killer because he was abused when he was young. I dont say that the story is not bad but the director of this movie should've taken all the audince in consideration because of the scenes and the language.
1,Its Ineptitude is matched only by its incomprehensibility...,"... and this is easily the WORST movie I have seen in the last few years. Marvel at Dennis Hopper CHEWING UP THE SCENERY in the hammiest performance he's given in ages and why, we ask ourselves, is Lance Hendrickson even in this turkey? Did he need to pay the rent? And the guy who plays the (supposedly) charismatic killer has all the charisma of a toilet roll (he also wrote this, which explains a great deal... Kevin Costner doesn't have a patch on this guy as far as pointless vanity projects go). Stuff happens! Why? Who knows? And who cares!Do yourself a favor and run like hell if you even so much as glimpse the DVD cover of this mess."
5,A Jewel Of A Book,"If this book had met only 1/2 of my expectations, I would have been pleased. It exceeded them. Every page is a series of surprises and delights. Whether you're interested in Architecture, or just love classy gadgets, this is your book. I cannot imagine anyone who, getting this book as a gift, would not be delighted. Read the product description, and add 50%. The only down sides are the long delivery time, and the book's delicacy. One is torn between wanting to look at its contents repeatedly, and the fear that the book might be damaged by too much handling. Order two!!"
4,great beginner bag,"This is my first bag, I love it. It would have been nice, if it had some better gloves. But for the price and with free shipping I can't complain."
3,Hurts my Ears,"My grandmother gave these to me, beacause she sold her computer. They really hurt your ears."
1,Disappointing writing,"This was one of the worst books on dance I have ever read! Maybe it was just a bad translation but the language was clumsy and most of all, the subject matter was just not compelling or informative. Ms. Wulff seemed to focus on details of little interest and the constant references/footnotes make the reading anything but smooth. Unless someone is completely unfamiliar with the dance world, I would not recommend this book at all."
4,Long but fascinating gem from teenage Handel.,"'Almira Königen von Castilien' was a 19 year old Handel's first attempt at Opera performed with encouragement from Mattheson and Keiser at the Hamburg Gänsemarkt in 1705. Typically of Hamburg operas the text is German with a few arias in Italian.Considering Handel's youth this is a very fine opera and Andrew Lawrence-King does it more than justice.Includes German/Italian text and English translation. Playing time is nearly four hours: 77'48"" 69'44"" 76'52"" ..and at this price a must for even those selective with Handel."
2,Amazon refuses to help we who are hearing impaired.,"This is an excellent movie I had seen before with captions. I thought I would enjoy seeing it again but i forgot about Amazon not helping the handicapped by offering sub-titles, so I gave up after about 1/4th of the movie."
4,Great book,I am just about done with this book and I have to highly recommend. It did grab my attention in the first chapter and so far I've found it hard to put it down and get to work! The perspective of the girl puts a different slant on the story of Macbeth. I find it fascinating. I plan on purchasing for a friend for the holidays.
3,"If it weren't for Gary Sinise, I wouldn't of wasted my time","I am a huge Gary Sinise fan which is the only reason I bought this movie. His part was not the best I've seen him play, but was by far the best of the movie."
1,Blech!,"I like several of Dr. McDougall's items, but not this one. Don't waste your money. Try one of his other soups instead, like the split pea or minestrone."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,This toy was a huge let down.It just doesn't work as is it advertised.It does not tip.
5,Rating for video purchase,I very much enjoyed this video. I was in Vietnam in 1968 and it just brought back a lot of memories.
1,Horrible,This software is more complicated to use than just doing it the old fashioned way. I get error messages constantly and documents disappear. DO NOT BUY THIS!
2,APA Help wasn't much help,"Not only is the software not very user friendly, including a help system that was not designed to answer the users questions, but the software crashed my computer."
1,Better have a back up plan!,"It's always nice to have someone to ""Help you"", I.e, APA Helper. The problem is, that there are certainly things (many) that you can't do with this software. And God forbid you are in the middle of a paper, and need references done. The stress I have felt (and uncertainity of it not working) using this program can only be compared to my first day of Army Basic Training, 30 years ago! I'd try another ""user friendly"" program."
1,Helper? Give me a break!,"I am in a doctorial program and thought this would be a great tool. After spending several hours entering data, everything looked great until it came time to stop working for the night. I received an error message and my data was lost.Over the next few days the ITT guys at the college where I work were unable to make the program work. I emailed the publisher (using their help desk) that was no help. I called and a support tech sent me to a web site to download a patch - didn't work! I called back and the tech help said, ""sorry, I don't know what to tell you.""I just learned how to do citations the old fashion way; just didn't feel like wasting more work time accomplishing nothing.That being said, I would give the printed manual (APA Style) four stars. It is very helpful. However, to receive five stars they need to simplify it some."
3,excellent service,I ordered the drum sticks and the service was excellent. I recieved them very quickly. The only issue that I had was that several of the drum sticks were warped. They were otherwise very usable.
4,Fascinating,"I bought this book as a gift for a new mom but ended up reading it myself. What an amazing group of twins! I feel like I've been let into a secret world.I always wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and now I feel like I know."
1,Completely Inapropraite for Intro. Discrete Structures Course,"This book made my Discrete Structures class the bane of my existence. The book gives horrible examples with explanations that are often incomplete, irrelevant, or require knowledge that has yet to be introduced. Hopefully you have a great professor who explains the material well in class, because using this book to try to learn something is a waste of time."
1,Very poor video...don't waste your money,"If you're interested in trees, trees and more trees then you might like this. If you're hoping to see (or revisit) some of the most iconic places on Bali you'll be extremely disappointed. They don't even go to Tanah Lot! And the music...you'd think the soundtrack would be indiginous Balinese gamalong music but it's not. It's some made-up soundtrack that does not even remotely sound like you're on Bali. Do not waste your money on this dvd."
2,"Gore gore gore and oh, did i mention gore?","This movie is one that I will never forget. It was originally made in New Zealand under the name of ""Brain Dead."" It is full of bad acting, cheezy gore, and dead zombie babies. Rent it first to see if it is your ""type,"" then buy it here."
2,Goriest movie ever!,"Thi movie was ridiculous. I love horror movies of all types, but this was crazy! I only gave it 2 stars for plot, but if you like lots of gore, this movie is for you. I've never seen so much blood in one movie! The acting could have been much better, but again, it had all the qualities of a good slice and dice. If you don't mind bad acting and a bit of ""cheez"", rent or buy the movie. However, if you're looking for a good quality horror movie with a suspensful plot, pass this one by."
5,Taking Risks with Watercolor,Loved this book and everything about it - it has changed my perspective on the way I am going to tackle my next painting. She is so good at describing in detail and the colours used. I also got the Video and really enjoy watching it over and over again.
1,Not a good buy,Product has suction cups on the bottom of the matt that do not work well. And forget returning the item because you will end up paying more for that then for the actual product. Also not as soft as I had hoped it would be. I don't recommend this product.
1,Tried all the options,Tried all the iterations. Can see the red light quite brightly.Hooking up Cable Box and TV to the stereo amplifier.No joy on any of the possibilities. Will try for a duplex cable.
1,Dilutes the signal too much,"I used this splitter to connect a PS3 and an XBox optical audio to my only port on my receiver. When the signals were sent through the splitter, the outgoing signal was too weak to send a signal through to the receiver. Each of the wires worked correctly independently, but when put through this splitter, it appears that the red light was too weak to send the proper signal to output any sound."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,just as many others on this site have posted...this item does not work. when the signal goes through the splitter it significantly lowers the signal. i tested it all ways i could think of and it never worked. i am an opened minded buyer and gave it a chance despite the bad reviews...but they were right. if you buy this item be sure that odds are you will be returning it.
4,Works Great if you get the cables all in the same way.,"The coupler doesn't have the round side/square side key for the toslink cables, so you have to make sure they are all put in the same way or it won't work. But once you do, it works great."
1,"Didn't work, different than picture.","This item didn't work, it's not even the same one as in the picture. I think that it's a cheap imitation. Don't waste your time with it."
4,I use this as a combiner - not a splitter,I have one optical input on my receiver and two sources - a PS3 and a DVD player. I've run short toslink cables from both devices to the splitter and connected the splitter to my receiver. As long as only one of those two devices is turned on I am able to get a signal lock. There is a fair amount of loss going through the splitter; I was only able to make it work with short (3 ft) cables without any sharp bends.
1,DON'T BUY!!,"I wished I would have read all reviews posted before!! this device didn't work from the first try, and I thought the quality of the audio cables I was using was not good enough, so I ordered a new one, but surprise, it didn't work! so please DON'T BUY IT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This product went over and above my expectations. I have digital audio in both my computer and my DVD player. I plugged each input into this splitter and the output to my stereo. The splitter was able to use the audio from my computer, then when the DVD player was on, switch to the DVD. This has the effect of having one side as a MAIN, where if digital audio is detected on the MAIN, it will pass that through, no matter whether or not anything is plugged into the secondary. So, if you connect this side to something you only have on when you want to hear audio through, it works wonderfully."
3,Lot 1000 Bicone Swarovski Crystals,"Would like to see more popular crystals in the mix, along with more of the larger sizes."
4,Mystery Unveiled,"Father Schmemann's book was required reading in my Lutheran seminary days. It illustrated the theology and the emotional depth of the Eastern Orthodox understanding of the sacraments, especially of the Lord's Supper. Although some theological differences still remain between Constantinople and Wittenberg, For the Life of the World helps bridge the gap and shows many areas of agreement."
5,True Orthodox Christianity,A Must read for anyone willing to find the true Christianity. Reveals and explains the Orthodox Church the true and holy one settled by Christ and continued by the apostles and having no modern changes of faith or trends. The same true and holy faith as in the first centuries worshiped by the apostles.
2,It's What You Pay For...,"For $5, I didn't expect hand-stitched, but it would've been nice to get one without the dark-colored runs in the polyester. Never good when it's torn in the package. Also, fabric is so thin you can see the color of the wall underneath; if you're using this as a wall hanging, keep it to a white wall only unless you're into a sienna-and-tan Polish flag. In short, price is right, product is all kinds of wrong."
3,For die-hard Milton fans,"This isn't Milton Nascimento at his best. The rhythms are a bittired at points or too melodramatic at others. Still, there is noescaping his soul-wrenchingly beautiful voice - so if you haven'tenjoyed his earlier work, put this album down right now and listento a few of his classics, like ""Anima"" or ""Vidro e corte""."
1,Ho Hum,"Safe chord sequences with bland octave melodies(x a few evennumbered bars) 1x soloist,repeat melody next soloist, etc. etc.Good sound,production & performance,zero innovation.A small notch above elevator muzak."
2,Musicians professional. Techs amateurish,Audio is poorly miked at times. Lighting frequently faults to blue red etc...Next time get a tech teams as straight ahead as this great jazz group.
3,3 speeches delivered by H.H. Dalai Lama,"This is fine quality videotaping of 3 public speeches delivered by H.H. Dalai Lama. I was disappointed that it was not teaching for the individual on inner peace. This has more to do with world peace. It is still a worthwhile product, nicely done. H.H. Dalai Lama always has a worthwhile message to share;this is just not what I had been hoping for."
3,"Excellent printing, but not a restoration","The book is available for free online as a pdf file, but it may be convenient to have a readable hard copy at a reasonable price; not so in my opinion.The copying and printing of the original text and photos are remarkable and very well done, but not to be confused with restoration of the original text and photos. The letters in the text, for example, range from just partially formed to fully formed, and the photos have not been restored beyond a considerable improvement in contrast. Many photos appear somewhat stark.As good as the copying and printing is, I think a transcription, and a more careful restoration of the photos would be more useful since the original is online."
4,More heat from Ro and Mike Dean,"This new LP from Z-Ro is heat. If you like ""Life of Joseph P. .."" you will be impressed. The production value sounds better and the vibe is more upbeat than the last one which was real heavy and emotional. Some songs, like the song with Ashanti, are not good, but when Z-Ro works with Mike Dean the result is always dope. These two have a good chemsitry because Mike Deans sound is real melodic and Z-Ro has a good singing voice for the hooks. He sings a bit like Isaac Hayes. Overall I don't think the material is as solid end to end musically as the last album, but it has a better sounding lower end; I think they paid more attention to the mastering this time. He has a rap style similar to a mix of Bun B and Tupac, he can spit. Z-Ro went to jail shortly after the last album came out and he didn't get a chance to promote it right. This album has songs that will probably appeal to a wider audience and it will be good to see Z-Ro get the respect he deserves"
3,Doesn't Quite Live up to Its Potential,"Brilliant beginning. Sulu gets zombified. Kirk, Spock, and two crewmen beam down to the planet to try and set things right and are just in time for a mandatory orgy, which they manage to avoid. They get involved in a secret plot to set things right but the story slows down. An ""Enterprise is losing its orbit"" subplot is added, but seems phoned in.Kirk's moralizing speech to Landru is very interesting, but rather hypocritical if you think about it very hard. (Kirk frequently chastises computers for failing their prime directive. Wouldn't that be great if one of them told him to examine his own behavior?) The ""Changeling"", The ""Ultimate Computer"", and ""I, Mudd"" all involve Kirk vs. a computer, and they are all superior to this particular story.This is still a worthy episode, and should be owned by any serious Star Trek fan. With a little work, though, it could have been so much better."
3,Fans of Romance Will Probably Enjoy This Story,"This is a bit formulaic, the story wasn't unpleasant, if there had been more character development I would have enjoyed it more. As it was it was okay, not great, not awful."
3,It Works and Is Unique,"This is a cool pull, I am a space nut so perfect for me. It does tend to swing and make noise when it hits things because it is substantial. I do wish it was a little less expensive overall."
5,Sky high six thousand miles away,"This is one of the most underated albums of the 90's, it was a real comeback following the Scream's flirtation with Stones styled rock. This is a dense batch of Dark yet uplifting songs, covering but not copying all genres. The most essential Primal Scream album."
1,Ever wondered what the sound of a slow death was?,"Primal Scream always had taalent although always seemed to be just another ""white rock band"" desperately trying to fit into another catagory which they ultimately could never do. On ""Vanishing Point"", they give an example of a band, at one time doing what they liked, into a band doing what they must think is expected of them. For some reason, many people out there, including the Scream, think that adding a few pathetic beats and the odd keyboard to an album makes it something inventive. ""Vanishing point"" is a cd which does exactly that. What they seemed to forget when adding these new features was the inclusion of good tunes. Most songs sound like accompanyments to some film soundtrack (one track actually was included on the trainspotting cd) and the lyrics are some ridiculous attempt to associate it with the cult film Vanishing Point. All in all, a wasted effort and one that truely deserves its place in the bargain bin where i found it."
2,"If you can't read it somehow, you haven't missed a thing....","The title up above is because the book comes basicly down to this: Say you love yourself every day, than you'll start believing it and showing it to the outside. If you really want to get to know your so called authentic self, than you may want to look into Phil McGraw his books or Wayne Dyer. The first one can be frequently very direct and harsh, so for a more gentle approach read things of the second. But still changes come all down to hard work, which only you can do, cause no one else can do it for you!"
2,You can grill a steak on it.......................heats on ! ! !,"This is so sad, beacause when I got it, I was so excited that I finally had a sleek envy-worthy computer. I paid a lot of money, and as a student Im making do because I cant afford another one.""Turning On the Grill""The laptop worked perfectly for 1 year, then it started heating up, then the heat became uncomfortable to the touch, then it just heated up and 30 minutes later it would turn itself off. So now when I use it, I run it on low power and low screen light. Right off the bat, my headphone jack got busted and now two of the USBs don't work. Im down to one USB, when it breaks Im screwd."
1,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered this Sony Vaio VGN-FS660 on-line. I received a different model, instead I received a VGN-FS875P. I was trying to replace a laptop. I am just glad that all of my accessories still fit this model, but it is heavier, with different memory, speed, weight, etc. I was disappointed that I was not notified if the company was out of stock, or if this was just shody company policy. They must have assumed that this was an upgrade. I want the choice, not to have the choice made for me. Poor, very poor."
2,"Good to use, but very poor poor quality","My experience with that laptop has been very positive when it was working. The mainboard burned after 1,5 years - that NEVER happened to me with any of the IBMs and DELLs.My recommendation - stay away if you like to lose money."
3,Angels Watch,What a doll! She isn't as funny here as she has been in the past but give her a break. Read what the poor girl has gone through.
5,The Sound of the Rococo Era,"For years I had Rosetti's Quartet no. 1, enjoying it as a gem-like example of early Classical, or the term I like, Rococo. Though Rosetti is little known, he was one of those marvelous composers whose works seem to come from the soul of an era and its sensibility. The quartets op. 6 typify the courtly, witty, refined, balanced and tasteful spirit of the fine arts in the final third of the eighteenth century. Moreover, this well-crafted music is freshly entertaining, a pleasure to listen to. The no. 1 was the only quartet obtainable, as far as I could determine, until this CD appeared. The Arioso Quartet's performance makes the most of Rosetti's talent as a composer, and cpo's recording is superb, as usual. Unfortunately, there seem to be scarcely any other recordings by the Arioso Quartet. They should unearth other neglected quartets from the same era."
5,The Best Tip book out there.,I've learned so much from this book. It is well written with great photos & the troubleshooting pages are a great help.Iwould recommend the book .
3,great but key problem,"this is a great set, not so easy to install though. Once you pass that, the whole set is great. amazing feel, responsiveness, connectivity, everything. THe only and huge problem I had is that the left side control key got kinda stuck. stopped working then. and so far no support from logitech, no email reply, no nothing. its bad for such an amount of money. if this is solved, without a doubt this is the best keyboard around. neat. but..."
2,Beauty and the Beast,"This is one beautiful keyboard! But underneath the pretty skin, a beast lies within. Many times over I had to restart my computer (windows xp pro) after coming out of suspense because Bluetooth failed to reconnect. I got the latest Bluetooth software from Logitech but still having issues. And after a while, the left Ctrl key started to give me problems. I had to press the key hard enough, otherwise I would just type v's or c's when I try to copy or paste. That got annoying real quick since with my work, I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts. I am not using the keyboard or the mouse anymore. I replaced the keyboard with an old Dell and the mouse with MX1000 which is working fantastically. 2 stars that I am giving is for the design and the effort Logitech put into it."
4,Still working 6 years later,"It's rare that a piece of computer hardware these days will last longer than a few years. Keyboards have always been somewhat an exception, but I feel this product warrants special mention as a long-lasting item.We use this mouse and keyboard with a computer hooked up to the TV. It works from 30 feet away, anywhere in our living room/kitchen/dining room, anywhere we might be able to see the TV from.A couple years ago, the contacts on the charging base station stopped working, but we just started charging the batteries in a battery charger. The batteries in the mouse last between 3-5 days, so we have two sets that we trade off with.I take off one star because there are some software issues that can require (after a week or so of uptime, and multiple suspend/resume cycles) to renew the bluetooth connection with mouse and keyboard."
4,You won't be able to put it down,"I wasn't a Nirvana fan when I read this book. I just thought it sounded like a good read. Not knowing much about the suicide/murder, whichever you prefer, really helped me to remain non-objective about all the evidence. I'm still not entirely convinced one way or the other, but I do know that this was a great book. It was extremely interesting and hard to put down. The author goes into legal detail, but without losing the audience. The goes into the details of the death without being too gruesome. It's truly a great, fast-paced read that I would reccomend to anyone, Nirvana fan or not."
4,Awesome book.,"This book Love & Death was most definatley a page turner. Max Wallace and Ian Halperin did a great job investigating this case of the death of Kurt Cobain in great detail. The book starts off with a backround check of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. By the time you reach the fifth chapter of the book, you're pretty much convinced that Kurt did not kill himself. There are lots of facts in this book, as well as many not so good opinions about Courtney Love. I kept turning the pages of this book, and could not put the book down. The only bad thing about it was that there were so many characters that you kind of loose track of them and forget them, which leaves you confused. Another thing was that the book got very repative, and did not flow very well. Other than those two negatives, this book is great, and will make you a true believer that Kurt CObain did not commit suicide."
1,A waste of time and money,"I have never read anything so poorly written before.This ""book"" is a waste of time and of paper."
3,"Mostly a re-hash of the last book, but worth the read","This book is largely a repeat of the 1999 ""Who Killed Kurt Cobain,"" minus the long Cobain biography. In this edition, you'll still find some biographic information, but not so much that it takes up half the book - here it is only a chapter or two. This book tends to focus more on the theory that Kurt did not commit suicide, which makes the book more interesting and saves it from being too redundant. It seeks to prove, by rehashing the evidence from the last book in greater detail as well as by explicating new evidence, that Cobain's ""suicide"" was staged and even goes so far as to specifically imply who may have killed Cobain and why. There are only a few new revelations in this book, but it is worth the read to hear them. Because it is largely redundant, I give it the 3 star rating. However, if you are even slightly interested in the Cobain mystery, I strongly recommend this and the 1999 book."
5,Every Cobain fan must read this!,"Spread the word now - the hero of our generation, Kurt Cobain was murdered. If you don't believe, just read this brilliant tome. I have never read a better book. And I do believe Kurt was the victim of a murder conspiracy."
3,Pleasant but misleading packaging,"This music is attributed exclusively to the original artists in the packaging of this product, but is actually performed by unnamed parties that are presumably much less well known. It's professionally done, but mainly a dishonest, bait and switch product."
1,Feeding The Masses,"A poor rip off of Romeo's zombie flicks. I love horror movies but this one was not a favorite. Low budget and special effect were lacking. Story plot unoriginal, you have seen it before and it was done much better in other movies. Stick to George Romeo's ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of The Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"" if you want to see how zombie flicks should be done.This one was a big disappointment and I would save your money, rent it or better yet borrow it from someone who owns it, if you have to check it out for yourself."
1,Don't bother,"This movie was about as awful as it gets. I have seen countless and I mean countless zombie flicks but this one was absolutely horrible. There was not one redeeming aspect of this film. No budget, awful acting, even worse quality, bad writing, non-existant plot, I could go on forever. As a matter of fact they probably speant their whole budget on the cover art. Do yourself a favor, if you see this movie on the shelves, knock it on the floor, shut your eyes, reach out your arm and just pick one at random. It is bound to be better, I promise."
1,Upgrade problems for Macintosh users.,"This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out. That is the nature of the product.However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process. If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process. Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call. They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms. I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users? At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible."
5,Handel: Water Music; Music for the Royal Fireworks,"Whilst Handel is not as talented as that of Bach, he still is very much an amazing composer. Water Music is nothing short of sheer brilliance. Paillard is a very accomplished conductor and one could say that Handel himself would have been pleased by his fine work conducting this excellent piece of work. The book-let is a bit sparse but adequate. Without a doubt I give this recording 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended indeed."
3,quality issues,"I returned the first lens because it was back-focusing with my Pentax K100D. The second lens was ok, but strangely, softer than the first one in tests with a focusing chart (albeit no backfocusing).Both lenses appear softer than the Pentax kit 18-55mm, which is disappointing.I decided to keep the lens as it is the only 17-70mm that works with K100D body, is not absolutely terrible, and is not very expensive.If you buy this lens, check for backfocusing problems. Search the web for numerous posts about this."
3,Sibelius too rough,"As a violinist I was looking forward to this recording. I've heard his Lalo, which is spectacular. The Tchaikovsky on this recording is gorgeous; lush, rich, full, just the right tempo. However, the Sibelius, my favorite violin concerto, is played too roughly. It's a sensuous, flowing work with constant energy, but Vergerov is so rough and scratchy in the last movement I had to turn it off. Definitely buy it for the Tchaikovsky, but not the Sibelius."
3,An OK CD,I really loved their debut. This one falls short as I do hear the formula. The songs are all safe and bland. A real shame. I also get sick of all bands singing about religion and people having souls. Sing about reality and drop the pretension. One to avoid.
5,bte,"I've found, and was somewhat surprised to learn, that a lot of songs that I've heard on the radio and loved are by BTE. Bought this album and love it."
2,This is the second time this model has broken!,"Unfortunately, I have had problems with this design. When removing the cork, it can be hard to get the screw ""centered"" on the cork, which can make it go in cockeyed. The cork comes out okay but it will not disengage from the screw. Luckily I bought it at a store that guarantees satisfaction for life. Just wish it had lasted more than two years!"
3,Not an exact fit...,"My original fish tank was bought as a kit and it was difficult to find the exact replacement lamp sold separately. After purchasing this one, which is meant for a 10 gallon tank, I was a little disappointed that it didn't sit in its 'footing' properly on the hood-- it is a bit long. However, it does work and is functional and doesn't look too out of place, so overall I am pleased."
1,Save your money!,"I Did not like this book. Hard to follow,boring. Did not teach me anything. Don't waste your time or money!"
3,"Not really about Pan Am, but delightful","Charming, fun travelogues done by Pan Am for various ports of call around the world. I was expecting more of this to center around Pan Am and aviation, but it's all really about the destinations. Still, it's very entertaining and I've had a lot of fun going back in time to see world travel from the pre-jet age.Bottom line: This isn't about Pan Am - if you're looking for a Pan Am- or aviation-centric documentary, this doesn't fit the bill. Still worth it, though! Great footage."
3,PanAm video,"Nice post-war travelogues done by Panam for destinations they fly to. Note, however, that despite cover, it is not about flying boats."
2,"Starts Strong, then Pew!","This novel has interesting characters, an amazing pit of dead hogs, and a wonderful witch story. It dissolves about two-thirds of the way through, with vomitous violence."
5,A Wonderful Reference,"This book is full of little gems. I reccommend it to anyone who is interested in expanding on their knowledge of common courtesy. I consider myself to be a gentleman, but I learned many new things upon reading this book. I read it every few months just to refresh myself.This book is a must have for every man who aspires to be a gentleman."
2,More for a very young gentleman,"This book is certainly not for a man over 25 in my opinion. Most of the tidbits are common knowledge, at least I and many friends find them that way. There are always small bits here and there that are interesting, but this book is put together more like one you keep for light reading in the bathroom. I don't believe that not wearing and undershirt makes you less of a gentlemen--simply because an undershirt is just not required under all dress shirts, it is a matter of taste I think. Carrying a handkerchief is certainly a good idea, but I would rather see advice on what to do when a lady refuses one! In modern society many women have refused one from me because they don't want to ""Mess it up!"" We need a book for modern gentlemen that reflects the way the world responds to gentlemen today and written more in depth."
3,Silly and ripe for parody,"Despite the handful of useful or interesting tidbits in this book, I suggest you read it solely for entertainment purposes.However, if you're going to do that, I suggest reading ""The Semi-Complete Guide to Sort of Being a Gentleman"" by Sir Gentleman Brock LaBorde, Esq., a hilarious parody if ever there was such a thing. It takes all of John Bridges' stuffy, ridiculous rules, turns them on their heads, mixes in more absurdity, and absolutely demolishes them.Bridges belongs in the 19th century, as does his book."
2,Not good,"This book didn't have any pictures, which is nice to have when you are trying to envision the 'characters' in each book. Also, either the author didn't do it, or he was not able to get useful interviews, but there is no real depiction of the female victim in this book. It is almost as if she as a person didn't really matter - it focused so much on the husband. I just couldn't get a handle on whether or not the author purposely didn't go into that kind of detail to help the reader personalize with the victim; or, if the victim's relationships with other people were really as bizarre as they seem in this book."
3,Not the best true crime but not the worst either,"Jonathan Nyce was no ladykiller, at least not yet. When the plain Mr. Nyce set out to get married he did it the mail order way. His wife came from poverty and was more then happy to come to America where she lived in a big house, spent money and found herself a boyfriend. This was the first time I have read a true crime book and actually felt sorry for the killer. I don't condone what Mr. Nyce did but I couldn't help but feel some pity for him. The book is not a page turner but it is an easy read. So if you are in between finding that one really good book and want something to read in the meantime, then this book is for you."
2,Too repetitive,I was very disappointed in the writing style I was not able to finish the book got stuck all the time with author talking about what the company was achieving he gave very little time about the wife. In one part of the book it states she is 22 having her first child and in the photos she is getting married and 23 and had not had children before the wedding.Conflicting!!The book did not flow I felt if he spoke one more time about the company the Dr created I was going to scream.I won't be buying John Glatts books again I want to be entertained not bored with details that is not necessary.
1,How Greatest Hits Albums Do These Guys Have,Enough already with the positive reviews. How many times can a greatest hits album be re released and there be stupid people around to buy it. This might be fine for the super casual fan but for a real true Chicago fan this collection isnt much. There are two new songs on this compilation Here In My Heart and The Only One. I dont own a Chicago greatest hits album because some of the best material will not be found on a greatest hits. The madness doesent stop with this cd the following year in 1998 they would release by they i mean the record company would release the heart of chicago volume-2 with two new songs that are worse than the two on this cd. All i can say is avoid this
2,"Meandering ""Best Of""","In the old days, when a band would record 2 new songs, they'd put out a 45. These days, it's an excuse to rope people into buying yet another ""Greatest hits"" collection. I guess it's cheaper than buying TWO CD-singles for the new tunes! I'll admit: ""The Only One"" is a gorgeous tune whose lyrics cut right to my soul! And ""Here In My Heart"" isn't bad either! But the rest-- I think it's the track order that bugs me. No real ""beginning"" or ""finale"". But then it hits me-- especially in light of HEART OF CHICAGO VOLUME 2--together these 2 albums actually comprise what amounts (more or less) to their current LIVE set! I guess that's the problem-- when I saw them recently, they saved all the ""exciting"" numbers for the SECOND half."
2,Save Your Money Folks!,"Save your money unless YOU TRULY ARE A FAN OF CHICAGO! The only tracks I listen to are HARD HABIT TO BREAK and IF YOU'RE LEAVING NOW. The other tracks really didn't do anything for me. I would say that a more complete volume of ""best of"" would probably be a better choice."
5,I beg to differ with Yawn III...,"I believe this is an awesome album which deserves some American attention... there are several edited tracks on this album that were once only available if you bought the single when they were hits. I think that this is a good release, and it's too bad that Americans can't go out and buy it in stores as the Japanese can."
4,"Good Collection of the Commercial Chicago, but...","This is a good collection, mostly of their big ballads. It gives the listener a good idea of what the band was able to sell and play on the radio. There are four #1 singles.It does not, however, give us the whole story of the real band. ""Make Me Smile"", ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"", ""Beginnings"" and the coda of ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away"" are only apetizers. The rest of the album is good for slow-dancing and the ""Delilah"" show."
2,Disappointing,"The lunchbox was scratched and dented and one of the rivets on the handle was broken off so the handle was hanging loose. It was a gift for my boyfriend and I didn't look closely at it before I wrapped it. I was so disappointed that I gave a scratched, dented,and broken gift. Now I need to find the paperwork and go through the hassle of returning it."
5,A powerful tool!,This corkscrew is well designed and powerful! It will remove the tightest corks with little or no effort. I have used at least five different styles including the rabbit-type. This is the easiest by far.
3,Works fine but not that exciting,"It works fine, I don't understand how it's so much better than a regular corkscrew? We had a rabbit knock-off and loved it for 6 years until it broke. I think I'd rather have a real rabbit--this isn't much different than a regular corkscrew."
3,Good for beginner writers,"I got this book in a local library. It has the basic ideas for beginner writers, who have absolutely no idea of how to do it. It talks about strategies of writing and what you should do before and while writing your book. The explanations are very long, and sometimes it seems that Ronald Tobias was just trying to write more pages. Although the book is divided into many parts, I rarely saw any difference between any of them. They seem to say few ideas over and over in different words with different examples. In other words, if you want some light reading, 100% guarantee that you'll get what he's saying, you're a beginner, and you have enough free time, read this book. Otherwise, don't. I'm sure I can write everything he wrote in 20 pages."
5,A Great Collection of Leadership Essays,If you want a synopis of what is or has been said about leadership this is the book. I regularly use it as a reference text for my leadership classes.
1,a bad rip off of When Harry Met Sally,this is a sorry attempt of When Harry met Sally.very Predictable.the only film that i have enjoyed Tisha Campbell in was House Party 1 and parts of 2.Joe Torry is a funny Dude but he is always in 3rd tier films.
4,OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There's nothing out there like ""SPRUNG"".It's got romance and comedy all roll into one package.It's definitely a movie to watch any day of the week.The first time I saw this movie,it was on CABLE.I had no idea it was going 2 be this good.Just plain hilarious.I love that Brandy and Montell stayed 2gether despite the fact that their so called friends wanted 2 ruin their relationship when they(Adina and Clyde)found out that the whole thing was 4 real.And I also love the way Montell talks about how love feels like.Hit me pretty hard.I think that both men and women would appreciate such an art of a movie."
5,came right on time,It came right on time and was in perfect condition. Just like it was brand new. I give it 5 stars.
1,juck,"juck, dont waist or money... Gerber did not know what they were doing when they made this one... Gerber makes alot nicer ones for less money then this one"
1,Buyer Beware,"While ""Barkitecture"" is a wonderful and amusing compendium of interesting and even historic canine abodes (including a rare design by architect Frank Lloyd Wright), this ""paperback"" version is not that book. This publication is a collection of bound together postcards featuring photographs from the hardcover book. If you enjoyed the original book and want a to share some of the designs with others, this might be a great purchase. If you're looking for the paperback version of the original book, this is not it!"
1,Jimmy Smith Live in 69,NO GOOD! the Disc doesn't play on any DVD player. Its a dud. Would like to get my money back.
3,There are other's that are better for younger kids,"I bought this sticker book based on another ""My Giant Sticker Book"" we already had. The book itself is great -- lots of stickers and lots of pages, but this one doesn't contain the corresponding numbers on the stickers and pages. My current one numbers every sticker so it is easier for older kids and for the grown-ups helping the younger ones to know which page to put the sticker."
1,Bob Marley Spliff Poster,"Over-sized poster was distorted and discolored. I do not recommend this product. I search high and low for this poster, and was so excited when I found it only to be disappointed when I opened it. Well, I guess it's true what they say. ""You get what you pay for."""
1,Don't like this at all!,"This hat is not suitable for a small child. It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back."
5,cowgirl hat,Was very please in talking to someone at the store and received her advice in changing the size but when my granddaughter received it there wasn't any change in size so I guess it was already sent out or package for shipping and hadn't caught up with the computer information. But in all she love it and I thank you for making her day. I didn't have the heart to take from her and send it back the women was right I should of order a 1/2 size bigger then it would of fit perfect. As it is its a little small and she won't give it up for anyone. Thanks For being so helpful
5,Mercy,"I love this show, was a pity it didnt get a second season, great cast and got better as the season went on.its a good buy especially if u wanna see a hospital show from the nurses point of view, rather than the doctorsdeals with real issues"
5,Haven't seen DVD but LOVED the show,"I loved this show. Law & Order's demise is the fault of NBC execs & Leno vs Conan, NOT Mercy.Screw NBC for pulling a show with such an intense cliff-hanger of a season-not-series finale.If I were to get the next episode (the never to be aired episode of the non-existent season two), I would snap this up in a New Jersey heartbeat.Michelle Trachtenberg was terrific in this show, her best work ever. Taylor Schilling, the beautiful Jamie Lee Kirchner, James van der Beek, KELLY BISHOP -- great job playing a rich lady with ALS...Mary Stuart Masterson...the casting was superb all around."
2,Crazy liberal with an Evangelical twist,"If you enjoy TV shows with typical liberal ideology, you'll love this. It follows the thinking and daily life of a trite mindset portrayed as the only game in town. Small mind and shallow storyline for the uneducated. Sorry, just can't say anything good here. Time better spent in front of the tube any night of the week, take your pick."
3,A good start to a promising series.,"Margaret Maron is a witty and humorous writer and has done a great job with this first book in the Deborah Knott series. In this the first book we find out that Deborah is the youngest child, and only girl, in a very large family. Many mentions are made of her numerous brothers (but it isn't until the fourth book in the series that we actually find out how many brothers she has). Deborah currently resides with her Aunt Zel and Uncle Ash. She is asked to solve an 18-year-old murder by the murdered woman's daughter (who was just an infant at the time of the murder). Digging into this leads to two more murders in an attempt to cover up the original. The only downside can be trying to keep track of family members and whose kids are whose, etc. (if those types of details matter to you). Definitely a book worth reading."
5,Well worth reading,"This script is really very funny. It has made me laugh out load on many occasions. Many of the scenes are funny just to think about. Whilst it is not to be taken seriously, it does give a broad, and very funny, overview of American History. However this is a script, not a novel, and i would highly recommend that if you buy the script, in order to make the most out of it and understand it completely, that you also see the play performed, if you can, because it brings the script alive. It is a measure of just how good this book is, when you think its funny even without having seen it performed."
2,Look to other inspiration.,"At a request from a friend, I read the entire book and was disappointed. It does reflect the modern ""free verse"" movement which consists of poetry aspirants who completely avoid the beauty of meter and rhyme and write mediocre prose peppered with profanity, arranged in unmetered block form, and called poetry. Inspiring it is not."
3,"Very interesting idea, but not enough for an entire book","I read about this book in a review and related exercise plan in Fitness magazine, so I bought the book. Turns out all I needed to know was in that magazine article. The ideas in this book are great - it's a very easy to follow program for someone who is sedentary or hasn't worked out in ages. However, for someone who is used to working out for 20-60 minutes per session, it's hard for me to believe that only 10 minutes two to three times per day will do the trick. And I found it more difficult to find three ten-minute chunks of time than a single 60 minute time block during the day (you're supposed to space of the 10-minute sparks by a few hours), so this book wasn't good for my schedule. I like the diet advice - the changes the author suggests are to made VERY gradually w/o altering your present diet too much."
4,"So Far, So Good",I'm about 4 weeks into a program that I have largely based on this book. I am definitely making progress and feel a great deal better physically and mentally.The book's nutritional insights were of particular value to me. I love to eat (who doesn't?!) and the book has taught me how to eat better without feeling like I am in sacrifice mode.
4,"Quirky, funny, but still informative documentary","This is a very good movie. ONe that will keep you informed about where corn goes through the food markets. It turns out that corn pretty much goes everywhere, and as a result, is being consumed by humans at too high a level. It also turns out that this level is far too high to be healthy for any person. The sources of these problems rest with the food companies who have identified many means through which corn could be used to make food production less costly. Still, it is based for each individual. What can be done about this, well the movie is short on answers and this is its one weakness. Watch it and enjoy!!!!!"
5,excellent,"Wish they'd do a second film about soy... If people knew the impact the soy industry was having on our food, they'd be astonished. This film was a good basic overview of corn's impact."
5,Must see film as much about health as it is food,"This film is a must see for anyone interested not only in foodproduction and food policy in the United States, but also what ailes(sp?) us as a nation. The US government, and the agricultural industryhas unfortunately created a system that is out of whack. While we spendless than at any time on food, we are spending more and more onhealth-care (the one point I wish the film had made more directly).This film should be seen by all Americans. I saw another comment thatquiblbed with the particulars in the film. The film is not a doctoralthesis, it is a piece of art trying to raise awareness. I also thoughtthe device of the two filmmakers staking out an acre of corn andfollowing it through the year as a spine to the story was quitewonderful, as well as the animations that they did with a still camera.As far as I know you can also get the film to screen in your communityfrom the film's website. I highly recommend it - would be great foodfor thought."
3,Comfort equal to price!,"I bought this bike for riding around the neighborhood & trails with my kids. One ride & I knew it was not for me. The bike was cheap & so was the ride! This Huffy would be great for a growing teen, but not for women. Just NOT comfortable enough. I sold it immediately so I wouldn't have to pay for shipping it back."
1,Huffy Comfort BIke,"First, I must say that my daughter loves the bike. Her older sister has one and she wanted one just like it. Soft ride, suspension seat, easy shifting of gears...all to the good. My impression differs...then again, my opinion doesn't count nearly as much as my daughter's. The bike is not particularly well made, the components seem cheap, no matter how much tinkering with the shifting and gear mechanisms, I could only make it operate smoothly, yet less than as precise as one would expect. My opinion is skewed as I ride an expensive road bike with Campy Record components so my expectations may be too high..."
3,great product and fast shipper,the game is a little to technical for a quick play and will take time to get the hang of .
4,Very Impressive,"While the ever-changing garage interface continues, which is kind of annoying, the game play and graphics are amazing (as expected). The controls have been much improved and are very smooth. The auto-targeting and auto-boost features are very useful and the ""shields"" do help you maintain a few extra battle minutes. Overall very good, I hope it's long enough though (haven't beaten it yet)"
3,Drummer saves this band,"If it were'nt for drummer Roy McDonald, this band would be another bad punk/pop band. They are a bad punk/pop band, but the drummer is soooo much fun to watch."
5,Works great even in cloudy weather.,"Yes, I own this Battery Minder product too! My wife thinks I am a battery freak! Maybe I am!! So far, so good, with this unit as I would expect from this company. It is quite durable. Own this unit more than 2 years. I use it for a service truck AGM (non-leaking/sealed) battery hooked to a power inverter 12 to 120 volt. I bolted the solar panel to the top of my camper shell. Then installed control unit next to my inverter inside of camper shell. Unit works well and no problems to date. Wish I could hook another panel to it though. Manufacturer says you should not connect more solar panels. But I could always use another charge controller to add on another solar panel addition. As always, monitor your battery voltage after sundown and battery has ""rested"" for proper state of charge. Unit came with a quick reference unit for state of voltage/charge.Daniel"
5,Yummy coconut lotion!,Found the lotion at some surf shop in Santa Monica but they ran out! Went to the maker's website but it was twice as expensive. Thanks amazon! I love smelling like summer year long!
3,A Remarkable Life,"This book's major flaw is it was a bit too long and covered the same material too many times, but it was also a great backstage pass to thirty years of the Tonight Show, and an education in how talented and impressive a resume Ed McMahon has. Filled with anecdotes and stories from the early days of television, up through the close of the 1990's, For Laughing Out Loud tells the life and times of an entertainment icon, and does it in a good old fashioned way, without bad language, lurid anecdotes, or off color remarks. Ed McMahon is quite a guy!"
4,works good,works good for the aplication and with only one battery need it to work correctly. Sold item so must still be working.
5,Awesome and accurate! A must!,"If you're considering attending ISU, you should DEFINITELY check out this book. It's chock full of helpful, honest information that comes from actual students! It really is an accurate portrayl of life on campus here. A must-have for those who are considering Iowa State University!"
5,How to inspire your child to love maps,"My daughter chose this book for her book project at school. The book contains descriptions of different types of maps--everything from early maps charting the world to maps of the universe to semantic maps. It also contains interviews with mapmakers and other professionals that make and use maps from many different fields. What sets this book apart and makes it unforgettable is the author's engaging storytelling style. She makes maps relevant. For example, there is a great description of a map created by a woman who wanted to go running, but hated barking dogs. The map of her neighborhood that she created shows all the streets of her running route and where all the dogs live. The book vividly shows the intersection of cartography with science, history, even philosophy. After reading the book, my daughter started making maps. ""I had no idea you could make maps for everything,"" was her comment."
4,Interesting Indulgence,"My initial response to the disc was sadness...poor Shaun does indeed sound too f***ed up to sing on a few tracks. Given the trails he's blazed, not too surprising. But what sits with me after another listen is the beauty of hearing a man and a band at least attempt something different. Yes, this is an extension of the Mondays sound, but it is definately updated and, ultimately, quite strong creatively. Shaun's lyrics skip from quasi-profound to limply sophomoric, again indicating he is at least willing to streatch but not ever take himself, his band or his fans too seriously. For me, the Mondays were always more about the groove and the beats than the lyrical or literal translation of their songs. The album stands well against the Happy Mondays/Black Grape catalogue. Nothing revolutionary, but continuing their own experimental odyssey with a big f-you to whoever might care. Good show, boys."
4,It's been over a year....,"I got mine through amazon.com and it was a refurbished notebook. I adore the white keyboard and the sleek look. One thing I'm not too happy about is the sound quality. In order for me to hear songs, the volume has to be cranked up to the maximum and it's still not loud enough.Now, some of the letters on the keyboard is not working for me!!!It is rather bulky and heavy."

4,"For the price, how can you go wrong","I think this movie is pretty damn good for what it is. Its a pulp crime story about a guy who gets out of jail and starts talking care of old business. Things aren't ever that easy, and with a sub plot in tow, violence breaks out around every turn. If you liked Leary in suicide kings then you should like this. I'm waiting for the DVD, but for the low price how can you go wrong."
4,A philosophical version to modern music,"at first this song is slow and calm but then it changes to the sound of a different drum. in order to understand this song on a philosophical level, a reader must be willing to go against society and what is considered decorum. this, to me, is the first song that is meant to be noted on a spiritual level by the aurthor, KELLY CLARCKSON. it describes a journey - a person's journey- through life attempting to discover his/her true self, away from society and what is expected of them. althogh some are capable of finding this song as outspoken and contravercial and capabale of destroying old customs and traditions of society, it's not meant to prescribe chaos; it's intended to help one find halcyon. this song is meant to help and inspire people; just like great artists and writers have done before. her song reminds one of Emmerson when he profoundly states in his writings, ""Trust Thyself: every heart beats to that iron string."""
2,......You know......,.....There's no point in buying this anymore now that Kelly's released her sophomore album. Just go get that.
2,Kelly is the highlight just my thoughts...,"Hey all! Sorry, but i bought this soundtrack knowing that most of it would suck as I wasn't a huge PD fan. I bought it however just for breakaway by Clarkson because i heard the song and loved it and love all Kelly's other music. Whoever said that this c.d. was worth it just cause of Clarkson's song is so right and also the person that said that this was arguably her best song I so aggree. There are a few other hits. This is my time, and dance, dance, dance, and that one about more stars shine in the sky it might be because you live not sure. anyway just wanted to say my thoughts and give props to Kelly for the best song on here so worth the one song!!! God bless everyone!"
4,"Five good songs, others were worthless","Your Crowning Glory-Would buy the album just for this and 'Breakaway'. This is an absolute triumph for Julie Andrews. I cannot stress that enough; it is bloody fantastic to hear from her again!!!Breakaway-Other best song on here. My new favorite song!! Kelly has a simply lovely voice and the song itself is fantastic. Love the song, love the artist!!!!I Decide-Good song, good voice, catchy tune. End of story.This Is My Time-Third best song, next to 'Glory' and 'Breakaway'. Love the song, Raven's adorable, catchy tune. What more do you want?Because You Live-Fun song. Cute guy with a good voice. Again, end of story.I can't believe I was able to hear Julie Andrews sing again!!! I bloody cried when I heard her sing!!!!"
4,Great cd but somethings not right...,"This cd is very good, but i cant help to wonder its really hard to listen through all of it. I listened to it on my discman today on the way to the beach and i got an EXTREME headache.If your planning to get this and listen to it on a cd player maybe you should get it, but if you listen to music 99% of the time on your discman like me, dont waste your money because your just gonna get a migrain."
4,Very Good Headphones for The Price Range,"This headphones give you very good high notes. If you like strong bass, then this headphones may not be for you. But of you want clear voice, clear high, and reverberating sound, then I found this headphones is among the best. The headphones are also well made (which is especially rare for this price range), and its open back makes it very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. But one should note that the open-back feature may make this headphones unfit for noisy environments or for studios (where noise leak is unacceptable). Other owners also complained about the way the headphones (mis)fits over the ears. So you may want to try on a pair on before buying. Personally, I have absolutely no problem about the way the headphones fit over my ears. In summary, I don't think that you can get a better headphone for this price range."
4,Good.,I use these as my everyday headphones. The cord is really long. Too long for going outside with. More for inside/bedroom listening.
4,Hard Curves,"This book showcases Julie's wonderful art, especially her famous reflective metal technique. The artwork is to her usual high standard and is breathtaking. Her mastery of this art form is unsurpassed in my opinion. This is an excellent book, enough said!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Ivy,"THis was a much better Cd than i thought it would be.I only knew the song, edge of the ocean and I am really happy with nearly all the songs.sometimes it is a gamble buying a CD from a new artist, but I don't regret spending the money on this one."
5,"New Sound, Same Ivy Mood","I am a huge fan of all of Ivy's albums, but Long Distance remains a personal favorite. Ivy uses more synthetic, electronic sounds in this album, but retains the mature, thoughtful mood that characterizes their music. Dominique Durand's vocals sound as smooth and sultry as ever, effortlessly blending with the music. Songs like Undertow and Edge of the Ocean literally feel like being adrift in water, each beat and melody is like a new wave or layer of music. The album also has other songs like ""Lucy Doesn't Love You"" that are much more upbeat featuring great horn sections. If you've listened to Apartment Life, this album is an evolution in the Ivy sound, a more mature mood. If you're listening to them for the first time, sit back and appreciate one of the most underrated bands in America."
4,One of the most promising bands!,"First off, i discovered this band on the UPN show Roswell, and ever since then, I've fallen in love with them and their music. This band has got it all, HOT music, and amazing vocals by Dominique Durrand. I bought Apartment Life and Long Distance, and I'd have to say I love Long Distance a bit more. Dont get me wrong, Apartment Life is just ""classic"", but it was more guitar driven, which didn't set it apart from most bands out there. Long Distance however samples so many other musical aspects, from electronica, to trip/hop, breezy guitar pop, and keyboards>>I love it! They are definately in a class by themselves. Plus due to much recent exposure from Roswell, and the film Shallow Hall (which they did the score), and Edge of The Ocean, a track featured on the hit ABC's Alias, they are soooo on their way to making it main stream.Strong tracks include: Undertow, Edge of the Ocean, Blame It On Yourself, Dissapointed.....GO GET THIS ONE...ITS WAY WORTH IT!!!!"
1,not as good as I'd hoped,"I got this album because I heard IVY's song Worry About You as the theme for Kingdom Hospital. I figured the album would be filled with more haunting vocals... but I was fairly disapointed. Worry About You is a good song of course, and so is Midnight Sun, Lucy Dosen't Love You, and Digging Your Scene. But for me, the majority of the album is just filled with bad lyrics, cheaply sounding Dido immitating vocals, and songs that drag along."
4,Cover speaks for itself.,"I tried to read the commentary in the book - but look, who needs commentary with a book like this unless it's some interesting facts or trivia about said ""vixen""? Great coffee table book, and fun to cut out some of the pages and put into small frames for the house too."
2,Good CD that you'll probably listen to once or twice.,Catchy and cutting edge. Unfortunately you'll get sick of it fast
3,Interesting but far from revolutionary...,"The first two tracks are wonderfully upbeat and fun, combining pop/hip-hop beats with world (Eastern) sprinkles added in for flare. ""Asha"" is particularly catchy with one of the great lines in recent pop ""everybody needs a bosom for a pillow...mine's on the 45."" But the rest of the album falls short for me. The songs merely are boring hip-hop beats with what sounds like just some sitars and other ""world music"" textures added on as an afterthought. After repeated listens, the songs that were boring the first time don't reveal any new depth and are still boring. I just don't see, or rather hear, what all the hoopla is about. All that said, the album is better than most of the stuff that came out that year and would make a sound purchase if you're looking for some fun dorm-room music or background tunes for hanging out."
2,Overrated,"This album is totally over rated. Asha is good, Left Side is ok, but the rest is weird, one song is just record scrathing for three minutes. Maybe this music is appreciated in India, but not here!"
5,A Necessity!,"This book is a necessity to possess due to the fact that the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad lays out the history and destiny of America that is unfolding right before our eyes. This book was/is a wakeup call to America, a saving grace if you will, to correct its ills and atone for her sins. Otherwise, she will experience a most terrible fall and destruction. Subjects include the decline of the dollar, degeneracy of the American culture, educational system etc. The basis of the Messenger's teachings is Biblical and Quranic scripture. He ends the book by describing how America will be destroyed. This book is a must have by a prophetic voice, The Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad."
2,The Q'uran according to Eliah Muhammed,"A dark tome that pretends to prophesy an end to the United States, presenting that country as the focus of all evil; the domain of satan and sin, the modern Babylon. The argument is given an appropriate support from the writings of the Islamic Q'uran holy book, in view of the history of Muhammad, its founder, as a raider of caravans and killer of assorted Jews and infidels. The entire book is studded with exaggerations, baseless assumptions and misperceptions of reality, not to mention numerous actual falsehoods.I have given this book two stars, one because I believe that persons of education should read it and recognize the potential problems this type of writers and their followers can cause, and a second to call attention to its siren song of hatred and fear.The sorry aspect of the book is that this black god-shouter will (and does) have a following and an audience for his ignorant rant, much as an earlier white man, Jim Jones did."
1,Awful,"I am an AFI fan, but this record is just an atrocity to the eardrums. It is remiscent of really bad Offspring if you took away all the things that the Offspring did good. You would be better off buying ""Smash"" and ""Sing the Sorrow"" thatn this exercise in pain."
1,Horrible!!!,I waited an insanely long time for my order to come in. It came in after the the estimated delivery date and when it did finally come in the case was cracked. I wrote a couple of times to inquire about the whereabouts of my purchase and no one ever got back to me. This in my opinion is horrible service and I would never order from this individual ever again!
4,under rated and under appreciated,Good cd with all the songs she's known for. My favorites are 'Thats what love is' and 'Baby be mine'.
4,Miki...,"I've grew listening to Miki Howard since I was a kid, so I'm pleased to listen to all my favorite songs by her on this album."
5,Dude...They Rock!,OMG...I love Maroon 5...actually I'm more of obsessed...but wenI heard they used 2 b Karas Flowers I immidiately wanted 2 get the Karas Flowers CD...i love it! Soap Disco is da bestsong ever!
5,Book review,I found this book to be very helpful and applicable to the problems many people face today. Elyse is a very insightful writer and she has a way of feeling the readers pain in the way she writes.
5,Met and Exceeded Expectations,"This roof nailer arrived in 2 days and, I swear, was a new gun. The instructions were with it and I was able to use it immediately and make the necessary compression changes. The value of this tool definitely exceeds its cost, and I would purchase these ""reconditioned"" tools again and every day of the week.I am a contractor and was roofing a house with the nailer, which performed each time and every time. Reloading is easy and the weight is distributed and easy to manage."
4,A Rethinking,"I used to decry this album as simply an album that Sample made to fulfill some quota with Warner Bros. Yet, I now constantly look back at this album and realize that although there is very little new material on it, the album is still good. These are classics that he has done before, whether they be ten or twenty years before this album's release, but he still did them the same justice with the conventions of the mid 1990s. He has rethought his prior works, and has done so well. And thusly, I have rethought this album and whether or not real art has taken place. It has."
5,Great jazz CD,"I first heard of Joe Sample when I listened to Soul Shadows, and I instantly loved it! There's lots of piano, my favorite instrument, and I'm a growing fan of jazz music. The tracks on this CD are light, classy and enjoyable. I'm Coming Back Again, Soul Shadows and Street Life are my favorites. Most of the CD contains instrumental tracks, and some, including the ones listed above, are sung by either Joe Sample or guest artists. Get this CD!!! It's great."
5,Captivating Sucinct Prose,"This book is well worth the read and re-read that the amazingly layered poetry/prose inspires. Dark Optimism also has short shorts - ""flash fiction"", which the author is a master of. You will enjoy this book even more the second time through. The small bits it is composed of hang like jewels of dew on a spider web and intice you to laugh and cry and awake in recognition of the spiritual in the mundane. The only similiar book I have read in the past 20 years that reaches this level of excellence is translated from the Japanese and called Palm of the Hand Stories. Dark Optimism is equally compelling."
4,Great for the price,"I was not looking to break the bank on an entertainment center. I just wanted a reliable one with wireless rear speakers. This one has 2 speakers in one large wireless rear. One power plug no other wires for the speaker. The wireless is RF (RF- does not need a direct line of sight infa-red does). It was purchaced through Amazon from Discount Jungle refurb so it was only $185 (-$30 for getting Amazon card: $155). This is $400 new and most name brands with wireless rear are minimum $400. Works fine, sounds great. Great buy if your not looking for top of the line."
5,great covers,"i would have to say as far as cover albums are this one is the bomb! true some of these bands are indes,but they did good to metallica's rockin songs. i love metallica and i love the album. i really love this album the riffs are almost exact to the ones james,kirk,cliff and jason play. Unfourtnely,i didn't have any songs from ""load"". i would have loved to hear a cover of ""king nothing"" and ""until it sleeps"".great album otherwise."
2,Prerequisites required as well,"First, read the other reviews. Next consider that from the start this book was written with the expectation that you have read ""...Robotic Experiments for the Evil Genius"". This was never a beginners book. Also, all examples reference Micros PIKkit2. If you are struggling with another interface you won't find this much help."
4,Was a very good book for me,"I used this book two years ago to learn about microcontrollers, both programming and interfacing them to I/O devices. I already had previous knowledge of general computer programming and basic electronics, but knew nothing about microcontrollers. I did not go through the whole book, but stopped after the assembly language information in Sections Eight and Nine.I found the book filled with very useful information and examples, and since it was based on the inexpensive PICKit 1 it was very cost effective. It made it possible for me to build several small but useful projects using 8 and 14 pin PICs."
2,Lost in Translation,"This book begins with a very good introduction, lost its pace and all sense of orientation at the middle of the book. Although is a good introduction for C and Assembly Languages used with PIC. Do not buy this book if you are newbie or want to learn PIC programming."
4,Inexpensive method of learning PICs and Beginner Robotics,"I just purchased this book plus 123 Robotics Experiments for the Evil Genius by the same author. As noted by other reviewers the book has typoes and errors, but the included C and ASM programs have the corrected code without errors or typoes. Briefly the Robotics book is a prerequisite for this book, if you are a beginner in Electronics. The experiments are similar with one using the Basic Stamp and the other using PICKIT1. The parts list for Robotics can be ordered online as a kit and these parts can be used by this book."
3,The Idiot's Guide to Statistics,Book was very informative and easy to understand. However it did not discuss many of the concepts needed for my statistics class.
5,Must Buy for All Film Fans!,"This set is priceless. Kubrick is the greatest film maker of all-time, and here's the proof. The best part of all this is that the documentary of his unique life is included. This alone is worth the price of admission!"
5,movies for people who like movies,"Well, to be honest, i've only seen ""the shining"" & ""full metal jacket"". So spending $150 may seem like a bad move, but there's a reason these movies have been brought together. Stanley Kubrick was a _god_ (not THE god, but a god, mind you).His movies have been scrutinized so much, parodied to no end, and it's time for me to see what i might have been missing.It's the same reason i've read Stoker's ""dracula"" & Orwell's ""1984"".I'm no fool, I know this set is worth every penny. (@ it's current price, you're paying $16 & change for each disc, which is incredible since some are unavailable otherwise, and separately they cost about $20, or more.I'm not sure how to end, but i'll say that passing on these movies, and this great deal, would be a bad decision to make."
4,No need for dolby 5.1,"As an owner of the previous collection I do not think that the dolby 5.1 remix will add anything to the movies (2001 was already in dolby 5.1). I've enjoyed those movies time and time again and was never annoyed by the sound. The first collection was far from perfect, laking on the extras side, but the movies speak for themselves. And Eyes Wide Shut being still rated R, I guess the american public will still be considered as a second zone citizen (I'm really glad to be back in Europe). Frankly, the European version just shows how the american's censure system is flawed. I guess that what make South Park so funny! So even if the remix is a welcome addition for a lot of people, it's not enough to trash the old collection for the new one. I just need to find a way to get this 9th disc somehow..."
3,I expect more from Omar Tyree,"This book was okay, I feel like he's trying to compete in the wrong genre. It was worth the money but it was not a great story. It was too simplistic, better luck next time."
2,no point,The book had no point and just ended. I am glad I borrowed it instead of buying it. NOT THE TYPICAL OMAR TYREE READ! Try again...
3,Threequil??? (Trilogy),"Very interesting in the beginning, but towards the middle it got boring, extremely boring. There were a few good moments but the characters were in conversation and inactive. The beginning of the book was, like I said, VERY INTERESTING and hard to put down. I really think Omar Tyree should just let the flyy girl rest unless he plans on making a movie with it or something, which is the whole concept of this book. Please, please, please...leave Flyy Girl alone. You're ruining it for all of us!!! I know it's harsh, but it's the truth. I was disappointed, it gets 3 stars for the beginning of the book, but halfway through, you might as well just put it down. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoyed 'For The Love of Money'---Pryncez"
2,Why buy the book?,"I bought this book on-line hoping to see photos of beautiful rooms and get ideas for my own house. The book does have lovely color photos of beautiful rooms, but I knew I had seen them before... This book uses photos from the magazines I subscribe to, like Metropolitan Home. It might be a good choice for someone who doesn't spend much time looking through decorating magazines, but for me, it was a disappointment."
5,Great flavor,"We always keep a supply of Las Palmas red chile sauce in our pantry. It is the basis for much of our Mexican dishes, especially pozole and red chile stew. It's unavailable in the stores here in Kansas. When we can't get back to Texas to buy some, we order from Amazon.com and receive delivery in just a few days."
3,This DVD is what you would expect of a general review of 3 National Parks,"We are blessed with having visited the 3 featured National Parks and wanted this DVD as a pleasant reminder of those memorable occasions to supplement our personal photos. The programs are good, brief, being about 35 to 40 minutes for each feature, and the photography is of high quality. The narrative is enjoyable and we are satisfied with the purchase. The package contains a blu-ray disc and a another disc which contains a standard DVD version as well as a digital copy for a computer and/or mobile downlaod."
2,"NOT the fastest, and boring.","Michael Angelo is NOT the fastest shredder. That bore goes to Herman Li (LEE) from a power metal band called Dragonforce. He is so fast that you will check your disc to see if it is running at the correct speed. It all sounds speeded up and so boring. It's all power for the cause and saying very little musically.If you would like shred with tasteful musical lines, then listen to Scotty Anderson, Danny Gatton, Jimmy Bruno, Eric Johnson and jazz guitarists like Joe Pass and of course John McLaughlin with the original Mahavishnu Orchestra. Now that's impressive!"
3,I wish I could share everyone's enthusiasm.....,"Having dearly loved James Herriot's veterinary series many years ago, I was very enthusiastic about discovering Robert Sharp's book. Although it was a decent read, I didn't find that it to be anywhere near as heart-warming or charming as the Herriot series. Of course I enjoyed some of the stories because I am a huge animal lover, but it is not something I would recommend to my friends as a ""must read""."
3,just ok,"im a big sixers fan so i was excited to get this for my grandson, but as soon as i unsnapped it one of the snaps broke. I had to put it in the cleaners so now its ok..."
5,A good book,This was a very good Cassie book. It describes how being alone in the middle of a big mission is. It has a clever plot and solution to the many problems that challenged Cassie. It was not the most realistic kind of book with everybody except for Cassie getting sick but hey where can you find a book that is. All in all this was a very clever book and I recommend to people who don't just like books with no real interesting solution or plot but to peoplr who like clever and interesting ones.
5,Best HDMI Cable You Can buy,"This is the best ever Hdmi I ever used well this is my first time ever buying one I tryed it out on my HDTV and I could'nt beleive the amazing sharpness,quality,and crisp beautifulness from regular cables this gave the most amazing quality.I have never saw any quality that good in my Hdtv. Buy buy and buy I would buy this for everythinng in my house that needs an hdmi!!!!!! I even hooked it up to my computer i noticed the beautiful sharpness and lighting I have ever seen.PROS:Amazing quality, durable, Nice connectorsCons: I have only one problem and that its kind of really long 6 ft to be exact so technically it's no con because my tv is really high in the air so i used the length but its great beautiful."
3,Slave revolts lead to victory and tragedy.,"I wish this had some sort of write up in AMAZON because the movie was interesting. It stars Djimon Hinjoushou (forgive my spelling) the charismatic lead from AMISTAD. It has action, tragedy and powerful scenery. I just wish it was a little longer but it was an enjoyable bit of historic adventure."
5,STILL # ONE IN MY EYES!!,"NOT EVERYONE NEEDS THE TOP PROGRAM,TURBO TAX BASIC AND DELUXE. ARE ALSO WONDERFULFOR 7 YRS I'VE USED THESE PRODUCTS. ...STILL THE BEST OUT THERE COMPARED TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS.JUST ABOUT ANYONE CAN USE THESE ."
2,Forget it if you have dial-up,"I am a very long-time user of TurboTax and Quicken and am an IT professional. I have dial-up at home (where I use the software), and have previously had no problems downloading the upgrades or the state products. However this year, despite contacting customer support several times, getting a CD from them to upgrade the Federal (which was supposed to correct the problem downloading the state) and calling a toll-free number given by me by a customer service rep to get the state tax CD (which said when I called it that they had too many callers and so had blocked the line!!), I am still without the state. Am not sure what I am going to do."
4,Do Yourself A Favor - Use TurboTax!,"I absolutely HATE doing taxes, but I also hate paying someone big bucks to do them for me. This program keeps me from tearing my hair out during the agonizing process of doing my taxes. I highly recommend it!"
4,Deborah Knott books in general,"While not a great mystery in general all of the Deborah Knott books are a good read. The books lead you through the daily life of a rural county judge, her huge family of brothers, in-laws, nieces & nephews; love life and a local mystery.The books are interesting, colorful, descriptive and very readable. These are good books to curl up with when you do not want to tax your brain with a Clancy, Patterson or Berry. Probably best read from first book forward but not absolutely necessary."
1,Just Plain Bad,"I'm a huge supporter and reader of animal books, especially those with veterinarian authors. When I first saw this book at the library, I thought, ""Wow, a new twist on and old idea... a WILDLIFE veterinarian."" However, it wasn't far into the book I got sick of hearing about irrelevant, uninteresting happenings. The author is cocky and self-absorbed. His attempts at humor and general likeability are pathetic and easy to see through. I'm a hardy reader and will usually force myself to finish off even the most boring of books, but it was about halfway through I had to shut it for the last time. I actually got angry while reading it because it was THAT bad!"
2,more luaghs than horror,"Ever hear ""don't judge a book by it's cover""=this is a dvd like that...This movie is supposed to be based on some folktale in TX..with a family that has a witch mom, a retard for a son, and,of course, a sexy chick in the mix...The movie is funny to watch for the ""Retard"" Son=it's laughable and is funny seeing his witch mother hit him in the head with pots & pans...The acting is mediocre...Heard the movie's budget was about $2500-$5000--and it shows...basicly (according to the documentary extra on the dvd), it was just a guy who wrote a film and him and a few friends filmed this in six weekends...Blair Witch Project it's not, but it's ok...again, the best thing about this is the Retard"" (ironicly portrayed by the movie's writers).."
5,Even a beginner would notice...,"I've only recently started longboarding so I didn't think bearings would really make a difference to me. I saw these on sale and thought I'd give 'em a shot since they were so cheap. Wow. They make SO much difference! Riding is so much smoother, and i go on forever. I get about 5 times the distance i used to in one pump! I only wish i had ordered more during the sale!"
5,You CANT go wrong with these!,"I bought my 11 year old son a World Industries board for Christmas, no matter what I did I couldnt get the wheels to spin very free. I bought some ""Reds"" and WOW!!These are freaking amazing, put them in and he hauled a*$! He wiped out right off the bat! I am going to buy another set for when we clean the ones that are on now, so he wont have any down time. Like I said, you cant go wrong. I would recommend buying the Bones Speed Cream also. You cant beat these bearings, they are dirt cheap. I cant wait to take him back to the Mat Hoffman skatepark now!!"
5,Impressive,"I decided to get new wheels for my kids boards, and saw these listed at this great price and with shining reviews, so I figured, go all the way and get them. I did, and they are a nice improvement over what we had, which wasn't cheap stuff in the first place. Skateboard stores will sell you expensive stuff that isn't as good as these, so just buy them yourself and put them in, it is easy, if I could figure it out and do it, so can you."
5,Used for Razor A5 Lux Scooter,"I purchased these Reds to replace to stock bearings from the Razor scooter and there is a tremendous difference in speed and distance covered. However, you'll still struggle going uphill and in the wind. These aren't motorized you know. You'll need to get used to the speed with these especially for little kids.Installation for the Razor is easy. Remove the wheels from the scooter and simply punch out the stock bearings with a hammer and screwdriver and push these babies in."
5,Bones bearings are and have always been the best,Great bearings for any rider. Nicely priced and I love the longevity of these bearings. A couple cleanings every couple months and they give you plenty of use. Buy from Central Coast Surf and you will not be disappointed. Quick shipping and great packaging.
4,Great price.,"These are exactly what my skater son requested, and I could not beat this price! Delivery was as promised. Highly recommended by this skater Mom. :D"
2,Did the trick,seemed like a good deal compared to local shops and went on with no problems....good choice for upgrade to son's skateboard
2,Dreadful! Avoid!,"channel one & two both went out! BAH! Useless, + the sound sinks in the middle of the crossfader....it's a real pain for someone as precise as me. Basically you cant drift into one record after the other, it just kind of pops up(you cant adjust it either)."
2,DX626 Mixer,I HAD THINK THING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND I GOT TO REPLACE THE HOLE THING I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS THING I AM A MOBIL DJ AND MY WHOLE CHANNEL 2 WENT OUT NO GOOD @ A LIVE PARTY THE BPM SUCK ASLO I WOULDN'T RECCOMEND USING THAT IF U R A PRO.TOO LOOSE ALSO THE FADERS STRAIGHT WACK YALL BETTA STEP IT UP I USED TO PROMOTE YUO GUYS...........
5,"Best in a long, long time","The Paul songs on this are really amazing, some of his best songwriting since the Replacements. It's really fun, and the production hits all the right places. I'd see the movie just to hear these songs on a really big loud system. I can live with the non-Paul stuff, like the previous reviewer. And it's good to hear Talking Heads, actually. Wonderful. I never like soundtracks, but this really is best viewed as a Westerberg CD. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great little book with a BIG message,"Read this book with my 10 year old son. He and I really enjoyed it. I describe this book as a Magic Tree House type story for older kids. It has broad appeal, it an interesting and engaging read. Each chapter ends making you want to read more. Loved the lessons it teaches. Invaluable to young and old alike."
4,best yardbirds compliation so far,"All the hits plus, but since you eliminated only a few in the catalog why not add another disc and call it The Complete Yardbirds and be done with it, along with the original versions of Your a Better Man Than I, add Hang On Sloopy, Putty in Your Hands, Sweet Music, Farewell, Ever Since the World Began, Glimpses, Stealin, Stealin, Little Soldier Boy, and a true best of Smile On Me. Add a few From the BBC and ya got it. Why do a half ass job. MAYBE SO LATER THEY CAN MAKE IT COMPLETE AND MAKE MORE MONEY???????????????????"
1,Don't waste your money,"The kids played with it for less than an hour and it broke, we even didn't inflate it completey because we were concerned about it popping...don't waste your money."
5,Absolutely the Best,"My wife and I love this product. Soft, pliable and retains cold longer than any other we've ever tried. My wife uses it primarily for migraine headaches (the small size is particularly good for this) and I use it for innumerable muscle aches & injuries. Buy it -- you won't regret it."
3,"Interesting writing, good escapism.",I was disappointed by the lack of technical details but entertained by the off-the-grid daily living details and his daily activity reports.
5,Outfall! A great &#65533;*ckin' cd.,"This is a great punk cd if you like good fast tunes with rough punk vocals. Not unlike Jughead's Revenge, but with their own flavour. I have only had the cd for a month or so, but i can't see getting tired of it! It is the kind of music you can't help but get into. Another great band under the nitro record label. Also check out Jughead's Revenge, AFI, Guttermouth, and the Vandals"
3,Ordered two; one is defective.,I ordered two of these stuts for my 1991 Jeep Cherokee Laredo. One stut of the two was defective! It compressedwhen the rear lift was closed but would not re-extend when I tried to open the hatch again. The piston rod isfrozen in position. The other unit works just fine. This is a disappointment for sure. I've replaced several ofthese type of stuts over the years and this is the first one that ever gave a problem. I returned the defectiveunit to Amazon and they are sending a replacement. If it is OK (probably will be) then I'd give these units afive star--but only three for now even though one works perfectly.
3,This one is not vintage Eitzel,"While the thought of a collaboration between Mark Eitzel and Peter Buck initially sounds alluring the results of this one are often disappointing. Absent is the heartfelt longing and passion that so often shows up in Eitzel's earlier work and in it's place is Buck's signature REM guitar sound and song stylings. By no means should this CD be written off, as it contains some great music. However those familiar with Eitzel's work should not expect vintage Eitzel, but a departure that is not unwelcome, just different. On many songs Eitzel actually sounds like he's having a great time. All in all this is a nice collection of songs however I am more partial to ""60 Watt Silver Lining"" and ""Caught In A Trap...""."
3,Not really a lot of shows for the price. Average video quality.,"The first thing I noticed when we received these was you do get 5 disks but there are only 4 shows per disk. So be prepared not to receive a lot of shows. Price seems high for only 20 shows. The quality of the video ranged from poor to good. Some where obvisouly just a film of a TV monitor shot when the show was aired live, which was quite common in the 1950's. Later shows were on film and were good quality. Shows ranged from 1954 to 1960.The material is of course classic Jack Benny and still makes you laugh, particulary the Lucky Strike commericals which are included in some episodes (you can show your kids what TV was like in primitive times).There are no special features, not even chapter breaks. I wish they would do for Jack Benny what they did for I Love Lucy, those disks are packed with features, chapters, restored, etc. More than you ever expected. Oh Well."
4,Good pogo for 5 year old,"My five year old kept trying to use her big sister's pogo, and this is all she asked for for Christmas. She loves it and it appears well made."
4,Good start,"We got this for our 5 yo. She loves the idea of the pogo stick but even with the extra plastic base it's still hard to do.I was really happy that it came already put together. So she was able to try it out immediately.It is winter here and the ground is too soft to pogo outside so she's been trying it inside. It's a little noisy and you have to remind the child not to get their foot under the extended base. Otherwise, I think this will be a long and often used toy."
4,MiMi,I bought this for a Christmas present for my 6 year old granddaughter. She really likes it. It is well made and she is able to keep her balance better than if it didn't have the round base. Good choice!
4,Holy Spirit Encounter Bible,"The Holy Spirit Encounter Bible was a breath of fresh air. I love the details that is in the the encounter Bible, and I received the item on time and without tear is still enjoying the Bible."
5,Never tire of listening to this CD,"I am the kind of person who does not like to listen to the same music over and over. I get bored with it rather quickly, but not with this CD. I absolutely love the music, and the message. It makes me feel good to listen to it."
2,Not a good sequel,"I really liked Vol 1 (4 - 4 1/2 *'s), but would have passed on this were it not for the inexplicable (to me) rave reviews here. The samples were downright annoying and most of the music was just plain forgetable. Definitely not up to the standards of other Orb must-haves. I listened to it two or three times after purchase and it's sat on the rack since then. A disappointment, really."
4,nice product,"worked fine in my 2006 Tacoma single disc radio. Simple plug and play. Good audio quality for the time I used it. Only problem was when I cut the car off sometimes it wouldn't play as loud. All you had to do was turn it off and back to ACC. It stopped worked one time, and I had to restart the car. other then that it's a pretty solid buy for what you're getting."
5,Does the Job,"After getting the stereo removed (I left cords attached and just slid the radio out enough to plug this in), the device plugged right into the back and worked immediately. I used the Mediabridge RCA to 3.5mm cable to connect it to my media place (iPhone 4). I chose that cord because it fits into the audio port without me needing to take off my Apple Bumper case. The sound quality is great. You need to push the Disc button twice to activate it. The display is static and shows CD1 trk 1 1:01. I found that this was much easier then having to solder and modify the hardware of my radio."
1,B,Did not work for my 2007 corolla single cd player. Everything installed correctly. 90% of the time it does not recognize the aux input no matter how many times I press disc...
1,Terrible product,"This is without question the worst 'toy' we have bought for our toddler. I have just opened this product for our daughter and have already thown it into the garbage after the first use.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the picture on the product is totally misleading. Essentially this is colored, concentrated soap. The top of the 'crayon' is very fiddly and when you try to write with it the top shuts again so that nothing comes out. When you do manage to squeeze out some of the coloring it immediately starts to drip down the bathtub wall. After a few minutes it really looks like someone (with the red color) spit on the wall with a bloody mouth - it's that bad. Finally it has also stained the white between the tiles, so beware."
1,This must be a joke,"I bought these for my girls to play with in the bath. As it turns out, it's essentially colored liquid soap, so it runs down the walls of the bath when they try to write with it. The cap that you have to open to get the colored liquid out pops out, but as soon as you press on the wall, it closes, so the girls are constantly frustrated that no color is coming out. These could be the worst toy I've ever seen. Don't waste your money."
1,No Searching or Indexed pages = Nearly useless,"While the eBook has some great information, you can not search it using keywords. Even worse, while the index provides a detailed list of the topics, there are no corresponding ""page number"" that can be used to locate the indexed item in the eBook. I think this is a general limitation of Kindle Books. So to find a city in the eBook, you have to know the city's approximate location in France and then flip though the eBook until you come across it. Same for any tourist site. Which makes the eBook of use only if you want to read it from cover to cover, and along the way, bookmark the places you want to visit (bookmarks can be returned to). I'll be trying to return the eBook and buy the paper version."
2,A good start but...,"I have been to France 4 times now, and decided to use a new book on this trip. Lonely planet had many areas where it was ok - but equally disappointing in other areas. For Paris, jumping around from food to hotels to entertainment was annoying at best, and the maps...ugh the maps. Metro was best, but many times we were left on a street, not showing up on even the blown up maps. While there, we ran into someone that had been there for a full year, and she mention some basic places that quite frankly weren't even covered in the book. We also went to the Loire valley, and I must say it is mandatory to get another guide there.Definitely needs a major rework... we just got back from a week in France, and I cannot recommend this book.Just wanted to give others a heads up."
3,Not Great...,"I'm a major Rachel Stevens fan, but I have to admit, I was dissapointed with this one. More More More is a great song, but I already had the other More More More single, so I was in it for Shoulda Thought of That. I thought since the unreleased track ""Spin That Bottle"" on the Some Girls single was so great, this one might be equally good, but I was wrong. There are no strong vocals, and you're always waiting for that one point when the track gets suddenly better and you love it, but it never comes. The whole song is very generic. I felt like I'd already heard it by several different artists. I have to say, I shoulda thought of that before I purchased it."
2,Only One Good Point,"The text portion of the book is very informative about flax & I enjoyed reading it. The general ideas on how to incorporate flax into your diet are good. The actual recipes, however, are lame & most don't look healthy at all. I just tried one recipe this morning & it turned out terrible. I don't think I'll be wasting ingredients on another one of these recipes."
2,The Flax Cookbook,I was disappointed in this book. I may use it for one or two recipes butdefinitely not worth it to me.
3,Reminds Me of a Spam Sandwich,"Like Raban's A PASSAGE TO JUNEAU, this book reminds me of a spam sandwich made on delicious home-made bread. The obvious question....""Why louse up the bread with the spam?"" Both authors have some interesting observations on life on the sea. But both seem compelled to keep jumping out of their boats and into the remembrances of failed personal relationships. While I would recommend both books, I would also encourage both authors to find editors with enough courage to make some serious cuts. Who really cares to listen to them recount their all too common and banal problems?"
2,The (many) pages in between,"I kept waiting for Patterson to wow me with accounts of fish, sharks, exotic birds and strange discoveries he encountered on his Pacific voyage. Instead, he bored me silly with love affairs gone bad and his dreary days in the Canadian Army. If I want to hear about love gone bad, I'll tune my radio to a country music station."
3,More internal voyage than sea voyage.,"This book is as much a memoir of a particularly confusing time in the author's life as well as a meditation on travel writing, particularly his bete noire, Bruce Chatwin, as it is a sea adventure. Truth be told, the author is more intelligent than likeable but it is because of the intelligence that he manages to bring all the disparate elements and themes of the book into a satisfying whole. If it is primarily a good sea yarn you are looking for, this is probably not where you want to go, but if the more philosophical side of travel writing appeals to you I would recommend this book highly. His musings on Chatwin are especially intriguing. As a bonus the ending is harrowing and cathartic, leading to his concluding theme (that will amuse all us armchair travel readers): Stay Home--the water is only in between where you really live your life."
2,NO DVD IN THE CASE,"I ordered 2 Curious George DVDs on Dec 26, 2012. Just tried to play it for my kids. It's nothing in the case when we opened it???!!!"
5,Absolutely Seductive,Sultry vocal through deceptively simply melodies to standard ballads to love songs of loss and absurdity - a wonderful voice wooing the listeners through great production and selection of songs - a real keeper.
1,$45 for an Arthur C. Clarke interview + a rough draft,"This one escaped the editing stage. It gives Franklin and Graesser's references for definitions of intelligent agents and never even gives the name of Franklin's book, much less the others! None of the other material got me pumped, either."
3,Razor MX350,"I bought this for my 8 year old boys. It was fairly easy to assemble. We charged it over night and brought it to a local field to ride it. the grass was a little longer than a lawn. It wouldn't budge. We then brought it to a paved area and it ran fine (around 8 to 10 mph.) the boys like it but I was hoping to have them ride it in a field where there is no risk of cars etc.If you have a very short lawn or a large paved area it will be fun. also, it is smaller than I expected. Look at the specs. On the other hand where can you get a functional motorcycle for under $200!!!"
5,Too much fun!,"We bought this bike for our 6 yr old for Christmas. While it is small in size, it makes up for it in speed. I don't think I'd want my 6yr old on anything bigger going the speed it gets (faster than me on a regular bike going uphill). He has LOVED this bike so far and so does everyone in our neighborhood. The older children (8-12) can also ride it and have said how much they like it. It's perfect for his age/height. Would definately recommend! Esp. if you have a good yard/neighborhood to ride it in."
4,Razor MX350 dirt bike,We purschased two of these MX350 dirt bikes for my twin 6yr old boys and these MX350s are a great product. Just the right size for my boys. After spending several hundred dollars on other battery operated ride ons these bikes are a welcome addition. You can actually ride them in the dirt and they preform well. The only thing I am not happy about is the battery run time they could last longer although they do last the advertised time. My boys can ride for about 50 minutes then it takes hours to recharge. A very good starter motorcycle. You wont be disappointed with these. Parts a little hard to aquire but are available. Amazon is the cheapest I could find on the net for the MX350 and were delivered sooner than expected. A GREAT PRODUCT for an import.
3,My Son liked it but..,My Son loved the bike but the tire blew within 2 days. I had to order an Inner Tube one off the Razor website for 14$ Other than that it ran well for 2 days.I am waiting now for the tube to arrive.
5,razor dirt bike,got this item for our grandson for christmas. im sure he will love it. very good deal for the money.
5,Great for my 4 yr Old Grandson,"This was the best present I could give to my 4 yr old grandson who has been begging for a dirt bike. It is is a perfect fit for him though a little tough to use the hand brake. This is the second day of riding and he is just so excited he can't do anything else. Waiting for recharging is a bummer since it says it takes up to 8 hrs so we will get a second set of batteries. It seems to go for 45 minutes of straight out riding between charges. Box says for 12 year olds up but that is nuts. Our grandson is a big guy and this is just perfect for him. He was riding a bike without training wheels at 3 so at 4 1/2 he has no problem with this motorized bike. We got him elbow pads, riding pants, and helmet of course. he has dumped it a couple times but it is just easy and light for him to pick it up and keep on going. Highly recommend this toy. Maybe next christmas we get a gas model but this is perfect for a starter."
5,fun fun fun,my 6 year old son was a perfect fit for this. he learn to ride it very quickly. Goes way fast enough for his age. 8 months later it is still going strong!
4,Great buy,"Great looking electric motorcycle. Perfect for 5-8 years old. Seems very durable since my son crashed twice so far without breaking it. Long charge time and simple to use. I only wish the throttle had a little more play in it like the gas versions. When he started off riding at 5, I had to explain how to feather the throttle to start off slower."
3,Battery bad,"It is a nice bike, but we are having problems with the battery not holding the charge. We have to go back to Razor to get this matter settled."
1,Very DISAPPOINTED! DON'T BOTHER!!!,"I ordered this dirt bike for my son, and it only took 20 min to assemble and get it ready to ride. The instructions were easy and ALL the tools included.We charged it for 24 hours and my 8 year old son starting riding it. In no time he mastered the steering and was having a blast. He rode it for about 30 minutes non-stop. Then the motor STALLED, we thought it was the battery, so we put it to charge. The next day, it had the same problem. We called RAZOR and they suggested I take it to a repair dealer, the dealership owner was TERRIBLE kept insisting that I had to pay for the repairs, and that it was not under warrantee (although we bought it YESTERDAY). Called RAZOR again and they said I would have to travel 40 miles to next dealer or pack it up and send it to them-but we have to pay shipping.Not worth the hassle, so we returned it. My son was very disappointed. Looked like a lot of FUN! Good luck if you buy it."
4,Dirt Rocket,"We bought this bike for our son's 9th Birthday, because he saw it and thought it was cool. Well, if we waited until he was 13 like the recommendations say, the bike would be way too small.He really likes the bike! It goes at a good speed, faster than we thought, but good. Can't complain, it's a good bike and would recommend it. We worried about the fact that it is electric... but I didn't want to buy a gas powered dirt bike for my 9 year old, that kind of scares me.Hope this helps, thanks!"
4,Good fun; a formidable team!,"This ensemble has always had a very special rapport to show you. The jewels of the crown are 101 Eastbound and Bali run but there are interesting pieces such as Amoroso, Max-O-Man, Play, lady playIt is remarkable to underscore this is not essentially, the absolutely best of Fourplay. There are many others works that deserved to be included and for one or other reason are absent.Anyway, this is a worthy selection that works out adequately for any pleasant meeting with your closest friends. It is a rewarding choice that it will never let you down."
5,The best!,"I'll recommend this product to any music lover out there, My advise to those buying expensive CDs is ""Stop showing off"" an grow up. No one cares what you use and how much you spent on it...the bottom line is that it sound pretty good!"
4,Not thrilled,"Dimensions: greatUse: greatPrice: greatQuality: not greatI really don't like the wooden handle on this thing. It wears out very quickly and ends up being splinter-like. I can't see it holding up for very long. But, if you want a smaller flipper, what other choice do you really have, for the price? (hence why I gave it 4 stars)"
5,Perfect in everyway,This was just what I was looking for. I used this the other evening to serve small pieces of cake. The size was just right.
5,Referral Getter,I am a general remodeling contractor and people hire me and my tools. I charge top dollar for my work and my customers expect the best in return. Customers love the Dewalt compound miter saw and DEWALT DW723 Miter Saw Stand. It sets up fast and helps me get the job done quickly and accurately. I have gotten several referrals just because of this tool.
5,The BEST Miter stand period!!,"I looked at a lot of stands at differant prices and although the DeWalt is more expensive then most, it is worth every penny. The quality of this stand is superior to all others that I have seen or used. It also has a much longer total extension then most others. The saw when mounted can move from side to side on the stand allowing up to 12 feet of material to be supported on either side. The saw removes quickly from the stand and can be put back on in seconds. I had to drill two holes slighty larger on my miter saw (ProTech 12"" contractor) to fit the the stand bracket bolts, but this was no big deal.This is a fantastic stand in every respect. The price for it is well justified."
2,There are other miter saw stands that don't cost as much.,"I compared the Dewalt stand with the StableMate Plus100 stand at a local hardware store. The StableMate was a $100 dollars less, and supports 100 pounds more than the Dewalt stand. I bought the StableMate Plus100 and attached my new Dewalt miter saw to it. It is very stable with no movement in the stand. The extension bars adjust and slide out quickly, and the legs fold up smoothly for transporting. I am very happy with the choice I made. The StableMate Plus100 is a universal miter saw stand, so you shouldn't have to worry about your miter saw you attach to it. If you want to save some money, the StableMate is an attractive alternative."
5,Woah...nice legs!,"The DW723 is an essential accessory for anyone who owns the DW708 Compound Mitre Saw. The DW723 allows you to maintain an organized work area at a safe, convenient, and comfortable level. The stand is duarble, relatively lightweight, and suprisingly compact when collapsed for transport. This stand is flexible enough to handle production cuts in short and long lengths of stock or trim at almost any angle.Pros: Stability, Durability, Strength, Safety, LooksCons: 1 carriage bolt for mounting the saw to the quick release attachment interferes with the maximum mitre angle.Otherwise, very well built and a must have accessory for those in the finish carpentry business or for when you want to impress the do-it-yourself neighbor when you open the garage door.Beware open bed pick-up truck owners...secure this unit with a cable through the carry handle or it will walk off on its own."
5,Excellent Product,"DeWalt really had their thinking caps on when they designed this stand. The stand is compact,sturdy and very well made. $[money] may seem like a lot of money for a stand. After using it the first time, I consider it money well spent and would without a doubt, buy it again."
4,Dewalt Miter saw Stand,Easy to step up and transport. It is very sturdy and has the features needed to handle the long boards. I wish I had bought it many jobs ago. It will probably pay for itself on one deck job.
4,happpy with dewalt miter stand,"i recently purchased a dewalt dw723 after looking at some other brands. So far i'm impressed with this stands quick and stable set up.I thought i would want one on wheeels to move around the jobsite,but this stand has changed my mind.I can honestly recomend this tool to anyone, if there is a better stand out there please let us know!!"
3,Definitely the OTHER side of electronica.,"Definitely the OTHER side of electronica. A good all around album, but hardcore techno and d&b will probably feel sick while listening. Why do the vocals remind me of listening to an old Queensryche album? Is most like Portishead gone pop with a pinch of Kraftwerk. Best tracks: Believe, Purple, Gun."
3,Mixed Bag,"This is Cd that will you definitely listen to more than one time just to see if you missed anything the first time. Once past that point you will realize the only tracks that really grab you are ""Purple"" and ""Gun"". I had the opportunity of seeing Gus Gus but since it was before my purchase of the Cd I really couldn't appreciate their performance. The other tracks are the Cd are good, nothing to compel me to say this a must buy. If you buy this Cd prepare to hear varying degrees of trip-pop"
4,Captivating,"At times mellow, at times chilling, I was unsure how much I'd like this album. I'm glad I took the chance. This album creates a moderately hypnotic mood. I recommend it to those who prefer turning the lights out and raising the volume to semi-mellow trance music."
4,"cool, chilly - scandinavian","ask me why i like it? it is like asking smb why you like a red colour (i don't!). de gustibus non disputandum .. aw well. it is a nice and cold music with some warm beams coming from vocal part. there are 3 songs (no. 3, 7, 10) i could listen endlessly... if you want to stay within this mood buy also a record of biosphere. it is even more experimental. anyways, it is not poly-distorision (no digestion's disturbances!) - maybe polyester-ic somehow - and i enjoy it on and on, my feet even more. :o)"
2,AFI's worst...don't bother,"I don't know why people seem to think that this is AFI's 'hardest' or 'heaviest' album...it's not. There is considerable throat-damaging vocals by Davey Havok....but it really lacks the menace and emotion of latter work. In fact, most of the songs are little more than teenage tantrums. The production is shoddy, the vocals are whiny and it's not even as fast as the punkier tracks on Art of Drowning or Black Sails."
2,"Oops, my mistake!","I've been listening to this album for the last week, thinking it was their latest album. I was pretty severely disappointed that they had reverted from their more recent well crafted songs to something execatly like their older stuff (which I never thought had anything unique about it compared to other punk of the era).Okay, so it's their '97 album - that explains it... That said, it's probably more bland even that AT&SF.; On the plus note I can still be confident in AFI's growing improvement in songwriting ability of their last 3 albums (up to STS).Now I guess I have to see if they've swung too far the other way with their new one..."
4,Enjoyed it a lot,"This is more of a character study than a real mystery, but I for one didn't fully anticipate all the twists and turns. It kept me up most of the night because I found the characters and their development compelling and credible. What really made this story was the complexity of the characters and relationships, especially Amy's slow realization of exactly who her grandparents really were. The way various characters changed and grew was believable. I have read all of Maron's novels and this is a worthy addition."
2,Family Tree Fails,"I was a fan of Margaret Maron before the Deborah Knott series and found the New York characters much more complex. LAST LESSONS OF SUMMER marked the beginning of a decline of interest in her writings.Troubled young woman returns home to clean out her family home, her grandmother was murdered and her mother committed suicide. Charters from the D. Knott series make cameo appearances but everyone else is stock from hundreds of southern novels like card board cutouts at the fair.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
1,Remote control Land/Air,"Well, I'm not very happy about this product. I spent 100 dollars on it, to then find out that I had to spend another 40 on the battery and charger. After getting it charged, we tried it outside. The plane came down and hit the side walk chipping the very soft styrofoam that it is make out of. We then took it to the school field and lost total control and it just kept going and going. Well after 2 days of looking for it, I guess its gone! What a waste of money and the dissappointment that my 10 year old had to go through!!! No more of MGA's for us! Might have to put a stop to my daughters collection of Bratz becauase of this. My advice , DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!! I would not have even giving it a 1 rating, but I had to in order to make this post , I would have givin it a 0"
2,To good to be true !!!!,"Bought this for my 7 year old kid... Big dissapointment, it is techically impossible to fly the airplane. Tried every which way."
1,Time for Lonely Planet to really work on their guide book,"We love the Lonely Planet series and have traveled the world with them. Unfortunately, this one really missed the mark. I realize that it is difficult to put the whole of Japan in one guide book, but it felt like LP did not even try. Several restaurants were out of business. I can understand that change happens, but that much? The truly awful thing is the maps. They are virtually unusable. Come on, LP, there are many guide books with usable maps. You could at least make an attempt! The maps are so difficult to read, lack detail and put points on interest in the wrong place, that you better have some other way to find your way. Next time better I hope. I do not know what book would be better, but this one is definitely not the one."
5,Excellent sourcebook,"This profusely illustrated book, which is as comfortable on a coffee table as it is on a shelf with other sourcebooks, did not disappoint me. It has photographs of pieces of jewelry that fit in with the text, and has, as well, illustrations from tombs and other sources showing how the goldsmiths worked to make the pieces."
3,Carter tune up kit,The products are very good. The instructions could be better. Someone who is just getting these products needs more detailed help. I was able to figure it out mostly by using other sources.
3,So so,I was hoping the hole was large enough to slide over an olympic bar collar but it doesn't. It also only sticks to the full metal dumbbells not the ones with any vinyl covering. It you only need them to adhere to the metal dumbbells with a large flat surface they will serve your purpose fine.
1,Does not work!,"I purchased these covers hoping to avoid scratching my dvd's,but unfounately they simply dont work.If you place these skins on the dvd the machine wont recognize it ,so this is simply a waste of money."
5,"Great top, solid mounting","I have been very happy with this top, which is solid and flat. I built the router table in the book, ""Building Woodshop Workstations by Danny Proulx "", and modified the plan the fit this top. The top mounted in a solid manner, and the resulting router table has been great to work with. I am using the Bench Dog aluminium pro plate with my Bosch 1617 router. All of the leveling screws and mounting hardware allowed to align everything flush with the top. I have been very happy with all of the Bench Dog products, including their perfect feather boards, and Pro Fence that I am using with this table,"
2,Poor...,"Maggie's third diary wasn't worth the anticipated waiting for its release in bookstores. Much too short, the book revolved around guys: Justin, Maggie's old boyfriend, and a new spark of interest, Tyler Kendall. Tyler just *happens* to be a movie star, and he's fallen for Maggie. She falls right back for him, after much confusion with her mixed feelings and emotions. Even though CD is a hundred times more realistic than BSC, this book surely didn't show it. If you read the ending, you'll see how ""uh-uh-not-gonna-happen-in-this-lifetime"" it seems. But since it is a CD, and I love the series, it was worth a shot reading. If your interest is teenage romance, this is the book for you."
5,"if you want your brain to rot, this is the ticket.","my dad took this cd away after walking into my room during lucky the donkey. i wouldnt want to listen to this cd more than once a month, but listening to it for the first time is hillarious. if you are fifteen, or have a fifteen year old sense of humor, get this..."
2,music for posers by posers,"this cd is horrible. its not funny, it sounds so generic, they are homophobic. i think they are trying to be funny like the vandals, but doing a very bad job. i laughed one time the whole cd and the sound pretty much bored me. i like the first song but other than that its no good. two stars is being very very generous. if you are an inmature, unintelligant poser than buy this, but if you are not all three of those things dont buy this. it is a waste of money. if you want a funny cd buy The Vandals - Peace through Vandalism, because it sounds good too."
1,Get the land-sea 2 rc instead.....please,"The remote control plane, which one would assume is the most important feature of this product, is worthless. It is constructed of styrofoam. I almost mistook the plane for the styrofoam packaging that it was secured in. The other problem is simply that the plane did no fly. The only controls on the plane are the speeds of the two propellors. It flies no better than a balsa wood hobby shop plane.The car unit has no tolarance for moisture. We accidently steered it into a puddle and it is now useless. This is an awful amount of money to waste.The Land/Sea2 RC is well built and (of course) tolerates water. It also has four wheel drive and is a lot of fun."
1,Evolution gone bad,This truly mean-spirited book illustrates the evolution of Darwin's theory into Darwin's dogma.
3,A Cast Iron Loyalist,"I'd been looking for a cast iron loaf pan for a while and was very pleased to find this pan at such a great price. The size was smaller than my regular pans but that was not a problem. Although I typically prefer cast iron, if it is an option, in this case it didn't seem to make a big difference. I make our bread, I only used this pan one time and I'll continue to test it out but so far I haven't seen or tasted a big difference/advantage."
1,Motor stopped before ice cream was finished,"I too had an issue with the motor stopping before the ice cream was finished. Prior to this one, I had an old electric maker that my Mom had when I was growing up. When the motor finally stopped working, I received this one as a present. I like the stainless steel can, but the motor stopped after 10 minutes. We had to add water and poke at the ice to get it moving again. For the price, I am very disappointed in its performance. Who wants to hand crank it untily it is finished? I am going to buy the White Mountain ice cream maker."
2,Would NOT recommend!,"I have owned a set of these poles for a year. I do not like them because the cork grips are hard, small in diameter (and I have small hands) and they are slippery. The second time I used them one of the baskets came off. I had to stop skiing and put it back on but it continued to come off until it was lost. There are much better poles out there for the price."
5,Jinnah Creator of Pakistan,"It is absolutely true that no one but Hector Bolitho has beautifully written the biography of one of the greatest leader of the twentieth century. Infact, Mr. Bolitho painted the pictures for the readers with his amazing words. I could never learn more about Quid-i-Azam without his book...Thank you Mr. Bolitho for your great work."
3,"Good item, needs tweeking","Received item promply and in good condition. ***You have to bore your own holes to attach it to the table!! *** Invest in a cobalt drill bit. The adaptor plate was the wrong size for my router, called BenchDog and they sent the ""correct one"" immediatly. He warned me that they were having problems fitting my router to the plate [Bousch 1619 EVS]. Sure enough, none of the holes lined up. I had to mark and bore the plate myself and countersink. Everything else looks good. Preparing to build drawers after I finish this."
5,NONE BETTER,"I own this saw. I frame houses and use this saw everyday. It is the best saw I have used. I have tried every saw on the market. It is lighter, more powerfull and feels better in the hand than any other wormdrive saw. This saw comes with a hook that is soooo nice. There are less table parts to replace if you do just happen to drop it. The table and miter gauge are one piece. This means better angles and virtuly impossible to get out of alignment."
2,Not so great,"A reviewer before me said it perfectly: A gummy, uneven mess. When trying to apply to skin, you run into numerous clumps of gel that won't smooth out. The color is great, though the Perfectly Pink is really more of a plum and not at all what I'd call pink. I love the color, but don't want to risk walking out of the house with a hyper-pigmented unidentifiable bit of goo on my face."
2,Never again,"Color goes on and stays on, but it gets too goopey when it gets somewhat older and won't come out of the pump without squirting all over the place. Never again."
1,Best Selling Fiction,"Richard Clarke should keep better notes on what he has said previously in public. Either he has a poor memory or a total disdain for the truth. Either way, save your money and time by not being suckered into buying his ""book""!"
1,Truth? What truth?,"I find it amusing that so many reviews use the word Truth in their headlines to describe this book. Didn't O.J. Simpson write a book about his version of the truth? Perhaps O.J. Simpson can be included in that CBS Mini Series as well. And Robert Blake and Michael Jackson too. Perhaps pro wrestler Ric Flair can portray Howard Dean and do that wooooooo or yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah.This book is an obvious attempt to take away from the heroic and patriotic efforts of our leader Pres. George W. Bush.Democrats must be really scared. Perhaps it's time to recall a few more of their incompetent governors, senators or just flat out leeches.If they ever make a movie on John Kerry, Jim Nabors would be the ideal person to play that role. All Jim has to do is resurrect that ole Gomer Pyle character and he could play Kerry to a T.Skip this book. Buy a good dinner instead."
1,They begin to Wag the Dog....,"Before you open this book, you need the primer: ""Wag the Dog."" Then, perhaps you have a chance of seeing the revenge vented here. I see many so- called liberals review conservative books with deliberate misleading information and vitriolic statements. Let's not go there. It's not well written, nor well documented - mostly defensive posturing - that you can SEE as you read.It doesn't take long to get thru this - it's also repetitive.Then, there is the timing: as campaigns for this year's election begin. Now is when you're knowledge of the 'Wag the Dog' routine come into play. This is just one step in the process. This book will have a short life.If you truly read current events, you can even remember some of the discrepencies here."
1,Disappointing Partisan Hack Job,"I did not find this book credible. Clarke had many years to do something about terrorism, and he didn't. Obviously Clinton didn't do much either. The proof is in the pudding. Clarke has damaged the national security here. The book just is not convincing. I think Clarke's just a disgruntled man."
5,finding out why Bush is a disgrace for all Americans,"This was a fabulous book on finding the truth about how far your government will go to do a cover up. I have to admit I'm not high on the Bush administration, but I read this book with open eyes. The insight and truth this book unveils on how the Bush administration not only lied about what they knew of Osama Bin Laden, but how the USA could have stopped the attacks on 9/11 and simply did not want to.(...)"
2,It all depends on your point of view,"It's hard to believe that Bush could be due so much more blame for 911 in the 7 1/2 months that he was putting together an administration, than Clinton received for his eight years in office. It's also hard to fault Bush for paying attention to Iraq when he first got into office...they were shooting at our airplanes, they gassed and invaded assorted neighbors, and they tried to assassinate a sitting president, didn't they?Clarkes's prior e-mails and statements contradict this book often. If you hate Bush, you'll love this book. However, if you want to learn something about 9/11, go elsewhere."
5,Bush is scared,"I find it very interesting how this administration is trying to destroy Richard Clarke. Just this afternoon, the head of the ""intelligence"" committee has said that the justice department is now going to go after him for ""perjury.""The United States of America is becoming a joke. Freedom of speech? Only if you can afford a good lawyer. My entire family are now becoming former Republicans. I am an Independent. And I am NOT voting for Bush!Let the truth come out!"
4,A Lucid View of The War on Terror,"This administration has officially started to smear the author of this volume. However, the more they show over-zealous behavior, the more I'm convinced they are hiding some thing from us, the American people.This book is almost as taking a blindfold we were wearing for years. The tone is serious and apolitical. The author shows how the last three administrations ignored the threat of al-Qaeda posed to this country. This book also talks about implicit coercion this administration applied on him so that ""evidence"" of Saddam's links to al-Qaeda was found.The right wing is now saying the author is lying, but then again...that makes TWO White House desrters with similar stories. Coincidence? Read this daring piece and you be the judge, if you pardon the cliche."
3,Interesting book,"I consider myself open minded and read everything before I place an opinion. Some people here have obviously made comments without even reading the book.Fans of G.W.Bush will not like this book. Those of us who lost friends and family due to 911 will get teary eyed reading this book. All told, this is an important read if only because it tells another side of the story.If there are untruths herein, then let the Bush administration vigorously debate them and proove otherwise. Untill then, I encourage all Americans to at least give this book a read and form your own conclusions. But, read the book first.Even John Kerry said he would not form an opinion untill he read it. Why do so many people debate something without even taking the time to see what it is that they are debating? Doesn't make any sense to me."
1,A Creditably Problem,"Interveiwed by the Washington Post, Jan 23 1999, this same Richard Clarke stated that there was intelligence information showing that the aspirin factory in the Sudan had Iraqi scientist assisting in the production of nerve gas. It is a small wonder that the American people believe that there is a connection between Al Quida and Iraqi. He contributed to this belief. How can you believe he can give you any thing credible when he specifically stated that he will present what ever is politically expendient. He either lied to the reporter 2002 or he lied to commission. He is selling a book and it would not sell if it was not controversial."
1,John Kerry & Democrats thank you Clarke!,"any attacks on GWBII and his administration, even if they are not truthful are greatly appreciated. Perhaps you can be Kerry's running mate. You both are flim-flam-ish and don't seem to have any respect for facts or reality. You have already earned Kerry's respect. Sounds like you two would make a great team. Kinda of like Abbott & Costello, except, at least they were funny."
1,Pack of Lies,I've started reading this book and can't believe all the inconsistencies with what he's said in the past. He has no credibility
1,Impluasible Attack from a Has-Been,"An outrageous attack on his President when his country is engaged in a war on terrorism from a man who was formerly an insider and a trusted member of the Administration. A sad example of a failed bureaucrat treacherously telling tales, many of them ""tale tales"", apparently for revenge. Interestingly the tales told in this book are but one of several different versions told to reporters and to the private sessions of the 9/11 investigation committee. A caution to all readers: This is NOT a reliable source!"
2,"45 Tips and Tricks, but no method","I recommend Del Still's High Impact Hiring. It presents a method for behavior-based interviewing and candidate assessment. Dr. Mornell's book emphasizes a series of techniques and situations where you basically infer a candidate's suitability by your own interpretation. Certainly not based on fact. Behavior-based interviewing is based on asking and querying a candidate's past performance and description of how she did her job, and drilling down to gather facts and data, rather than infering qualities about the candidate based on responses to tests. In any case, every author of these books starts by describing the high cost of a hiring mistake. But that doesn't mean that what necessarily follows will prevent you from making a mistake. A book like this is entertaining and full of anecdotes, but does not provide a well-thought of method for avoiding mistakes."
4,for anyone who does a lot of hiring,"if you do a lot of interviewing and hiring then you know that the customary questioning about past performance just isn't enough. candidates are well versed and ready to ""snow"" you in that process. if you believe that not all candidates are seeking an honest and good fit with your organization but will do almost anything to get a job, then you need to have tools & techniques to improve your odds of a successful match. I am sure that the information in this book will enhance my ability to avoid mistakes."
5,Love it!,My daughter is a 1st grader. Her class project requires to show and tell an item. I think this is a great educational and straight forward puzzle. I loved to play it when I was a kid. The package came with 30 sets in good quality. The whole class kids love it!
2,"Tangrams are great, unfortunately only got four colors","I teach middle school math. Tangrams are great for many, many objectives. I specifically ordered the six colors because there were purple tangrams in the set and 12 year-olds love purple. Unfortunately, all three sets were the four color sets. No purple. They still work, and I still love tangrams, but I'm really disappointed about the lack of purple. If the robot had pulled the correct bucket off the shelf, this would be a five-star review."
5,A Must-Have Album For Any Lifehouse Fan,"As we know Lifehouse from thier first two albums, they've blended incredible acoustic sounds with edgy electric riffs and licks that has made them truly unlike any other band.I was definitely looking forward to more of that from this album, but after hearing it for the first time, I was a bit disappointed, because this album is much more mellow than thier previous releases. But, it seems to get better each time I listen to it. This cd seems to showcase the softer side of Lifehouse. It's a definite must-have for all Lifehouse fan's, and for those of you who might not like Lifehouse, it's something a little different that you might enjoy as well."
4,power pop that is full of pop,"These guys are a little too manufactured and preened for shopping mall teens to get much credibility. What is lost is that they are actually writing great music.Many of these songs, particularly 'side 2', are straightforward and catchy, with interesting melancholic guitar lines. One thing is there is too much 4/4 writing, making the songs sound alike, as if they were also recorded and produced similarly. I guess this makes it marketable, but washes out some of the unique songs here.The exuberance of lines like 'we're not gonna live for ever, so tell me is it now or never' and the peppy song going with it, remind me of early U2, who also seemed like they couldnt wait to take over the world. We'll see if these guys can."
5,Worth the wait!,This CD has a great flow with each track having its own identity. Lifehouse has been a favorite band for quite awhile and they live up to their reputation. Expectations were high and they met the challenge with their third CD. Purchase this and you won't be disappointed!!
4,I like it but,"The table was somewhat difficult to put together, especially leveling the plate that holds the router. It is also difficult to get the fence aligned so the work does not hold up as it is pushed through. On the other hand it is very stable, has a nice sized work surface and comes with accessories you pay extra for in other tables. Over all I am quite pleased with it."
1,Disapointment Again & Again,"Once again this router table has come up with a ""0"". In the manual it states their new Bosch 1617EVS router bolts right up to the mounting plate on this table. That is not true. There is no bolt pattern on the plate that will fit this (Bosch)router or any other brand on the market. Very expensive to acquire another plate from Bosch. Their distributor (Schlosser Tool) says ""go buy a piece of plastic and make your own plate. That's brilliant. Don't make the mistake of buying this one. Notice no one else has either."
1,No grease fitting: Design no better than OEM,"I bought these to replace the original tie rod ends on my 97 Corolla.My previous purchases of Moog tie rod ends always had grease fitting.These parts do no have any means to install a grease fitting. Also, pressing on the boot, there appears to be little grease that was installed in these.Major fail. Don't buy these, find another brand that has grease fittings on the tie rod ends."
1,Didn't work for me,Surface has to be completely flat for suction to hold. Couldn't get it to hold for the small dent on my car.
2,Bad quality case,"Tools seem to be okay, but the wire stripper is horrible. Needle nose doesn't fit where it's supposed to go, tools constantly fall out, and the case ""hinge"" on one side was broken when it arrived. A day later the other one cracked so now it's two separate halves."
5,Right on Time,"Throuth the years, good music has evolved... This is what you get! The ignorant is not allowed."
3,not as funky as i expected,seems to rigid and structed. the organicness and flavor of instrumental guitar funk isn't quite there.check out the first 5ive style disc for a taste of great contemporary funkiness.
3,not as good as their older stuff...,"First of all, let me say I've been a longtime Erasure fan. I have all their CD's (with the exception of ""Pop! The First 20 Hits""). I was just listening to ""Cowboy"" the other day after having it shelved for almost two years. When I first bought it, after listening to it a few times, I felt that it was not up to par compared to their previous material (I would've given it only 2-1/2 stars). Now after listening to it the other day, I noticed it had grown on me a little which is why it now deserves 3 stars. Although not as catchy or infectious (like say ""The Circus"" or ""Chorus""), it's still worth a listen. Who knows, the more I listen to it, the more stars it'll get! The best tracks are ""Rain"" and ""Reach Out"". By the way, get ""The Circus"". That is Erasure's best CD to date!"
5,Best Of Any Erasure Album,This is by far the best of any of the Erasure albums. Every song is excellent!
1,Not what you expect.. at all.,"I bought this DVD expecting to get some moves and tips on dancing, but all you get is a few interviews with Jax Steele (a stripper). The interviews are really just information on how to get started in the business, which you could always just Google. There are two dances in it, one he does for his girlfriend and the other is like a bachelorette party or something. The only somewhat decent advice he gives is to respond to your clients, which is a given. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you have extra money to spend and want a 10 second shot of him flapping his penis around."
4,"Short,poor animation but suprizingly good storyline.",This tape covers the history of some of the fighters and there experinces. It also tells about goro's childhood and other charecters.
1,"Not for you if your are under 5'6""","The Nojo sling is fine if you are over 5'6"" but if you are any shorter I'd recommend going to a maternity/nursing store and trying the Over the Shoulder Baby Holder. I rec'd the Nojo sling as a baby shower gift but hardly ever used it b/c my son sat too low on me even w/ the Nojo tightened as small as I could get it (the size of the Nojo is equivalent to a large OTSBH). I recently bought the OTSBH at the recommendation of another mom and I have worn my son every day since. The OTSBH comes in 3 standard sizes (special order XL) and dozens of different patterns (stars and moons, animals, flowers, solids, etc.). Although it costs $10 to $15 more, the OTSBH is well worth having so many choices and being able to wear my son!"
5,Love this sling!,"I have used the NoJo babyslings for 10 years and love them. From brand new infant to toddler sized children, they are easy to use and easy to clean. I highly recomend them!"
4,it grows with your baby,"What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs. My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take ""piggy"" out for a walk. With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me. The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one."
1,Piece of Junk,"I originally received the Sungli Front and Back carrier as one of my baby shower gifts. My husband had read reviews that it is better to use a sling to support baby's back. So, I returned the Sungli for this Nojo Sling. Boy was that a huge mistake. The Nojo is only good for babies 0-2 months. After that, you might as well chuck this for a front and back carrier. At 3 months, I attempted to use this sling as a face forward position and my baby hung so low that I was very worried that he might fall out of it. I always had to support his bottom with BOTH of my hands when he was in it, leaving me unable to do anything else. I think it is wise to get a Sungli Front and Back carrier than to waste your money on something that only lasts for just a couple months."
4,Loved It!,"I personally found this sling to be a lifesaver. My son was very cranky in the evenings and this sling is the only thing that saved me. I put him in it and he was instantly soothed. Of course I had to practice putting him in while he was happy, but he soon got used to it. The only downside to it is that it is difficult to put a baby into it while you are wearing it. I have to put my son in and then climb into the sling. I couldn't watch the free video to see the ""right"" way to do this since I only have a DVD player."
4,Easy to use,"I found this sling to be quite easy to use and comfortable for my newborn, who falls asleep every time I put him in it. It makes doing work around the house easier by freeing up both hands. It can be slightly restrictive to the shoulder it rests on, depending on how you wear it. However, I would imagine any sling would be similar in that regard. All in all, I highly recommend this product."
2,Just okay....,"I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him. I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work, so i thought this would help. It did, as long as I was sitting down. It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age. This sling is okay, but i really didn't use it much because it hurt my back. I ended up using my front carrier more, it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure. I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back."
2,Not very comfortable,"My daughter liked this sling (we have the blue version), but I found it uncomfortable. I have one shoulder that is messed up so I thought I could put her on the other shoulder. The problem was that it was very bulky and hard to adjust. I am small and my daughter is thin, for a baby anyway - no rolls, so I had to tighten it all the way and it still didn't feel right. I have found another kind with only fabric and a loop, meaning I could tighten it to fit a barbie in there! It's called something like a maya wrap and there are usually distributors in your area."
2,not great,"My experience with this carrier was nothing like the pictures of happy moms and babies! My son hated it, and it was awkward carrying him in it. I felt like he might roll out, and so always walked around with one hand supporting him, which completely defeats the purpose of hands-free! Despite this, I am a fan of the Dr. Sears books and baby-wearing philosophy -- I wish he hadn't endorsed this product! The Moby wrap and Bjorn are much better for wearing baby and for hands-free convenience."
5,Superb Value - Superb Quality,"I highly recommend this combo kit, it's well worth the additional price over the fixed base Bosch for such a value-added kit.The similar Porter-Cable kit is good quality also, but it is disappointing in ergonomics, with the hard edges of its handles causing some discomfort after continued use. It's only benefit is the number of standard jigs that accept P-C base plates as is.This soft-start Bosch is so smooth and comfortable it's a joy to use. The rounded wood handles and pistol-grip plunge router handles give firm control with an easy grip. The adjustment options are likewise exceptionally well-executed by Bosch.No disappointments."
5,Best tool in my shop,"This is the best tool I own. The second best is my bosch sliding compound miter saw. Coupled with my bench dog router table this router will do anything, raised panels or whatever. It is very smooth and quiet for a router."
3,Steve B,"Received my Bosch 1617EVSPK 2 1/4 HP router earlier than expected and in a well packaged box.However, the box, router, and manual on the tool list the unit as a TWO HORSE POWER router, not a 2 1/4 HP unit. I wrote to Bosch and apparently the UL (underwriter's laboratory) decided to upgrade the unit an extra 1/4 HP AFTER the tool, packaging, and written documentation were produced. A little confusing especially when Bosch offers an almost identical unit (1617PK) with a power rating of 2 HP. So to recap.........EVEN THOUGH everything about the router states its a 2 HP unit, in 'reality' its a 2 1/4 HP unit.Maybe if I leave some of my other tools around the shop long enough they too will grow into more powerful units!!!!!"
2,Nice router with a problem,"I have been very pleased with this router for about 6 mo. It is smooth, powerful and I love the soft start. Well, honeymoon is over. The typical switch failure has bit me. I thought I could keep it clean and I wouldn't have the reported problems. No joy. Folks if you use this router in a table you WILL have a problem. Probably sooner rather than later. Now just replacing a switch may not be a problem for most, but for me it has caused me lost production, down time and shipping cost to repair facility. And now I wonder how soon it will fail again.I am going to replace this router with another brand and relegate this one to handheld use only and at that as a back-up. I just don't trust it. I hope my issues help someone else make a decision."
3,Bad switch design,"This is a great router, BUT there is a design flaw with the switch. I have had mine for 13 months (one month out of warranty). I used it to make a cut, turned it off and then went to make another cut and it wouldn't turn on. There are many complaints in Amazon's reviews about this switch. Bosch needs to pay attention to these reviews and should redesign this switch! It ruined my woodworking weekend!"
4,"Great Value, Some Problems","The router itself is a thing of beauty and , when used with quality router bits (I prefer Frueds) is a wonderfully versatile machine. The soft start is a great feature, the plunge base is well designed and comfortable to use. Like a great many reviewers before me, my power switch died with no warning. I'll be taking it in for repair tomorrow; there may be an epilogue to this review in the future. No matter what, I believe that the electronics might be cause for concern. I bought my 1617EVSPK in Feb of 2004; maybe Bosch has corrected this problem on newer models, but you might want to look into that before taking the plunge. I was in the middle of a rather extensive project and am left feeling a little steamed by the breakdown.Also, my edge guide was shipped without the thumbscrews that affix it to the base of the router. I called Bosch and was treated less than courteously -they told me rather curtly to vall Amazon. Instead I found some machine screws that fit the bill."
5,Best Router Purchase,"This was an excellent Amazon promotional item that made it the best priced router in its class. Comes complete with the plunge attachment, 1/4"" collet & 1/2"" collet. The router, plunge attachment, all wrenches, hardware for mounting to a router table and collets are packaged in a strong carrying case. This router has the soft start feature and adjustment screw from the top for use in a router table. It has easy collet locking, fast macro depth setting and easy micro adjustment to set accurate depth of cuts. I have used it for a number of slots, edges and rabbit joints. I highly recommend this router to a anyone wanting a router that will provide all your routing needs."
5,solid starter kit,"sweet router kit. I am an amateur woodworker and it has been excellent. I love the case, it helps keep all the parts and accessories organized. Although it is my first Bosch product and first router, I love it. I just purchased the Bosch router table attachment, the one made of MDF and I love it as well. I want to get a barrel handle jigsaw, Bosch make.I'm not sure what all these people have been complaining about, for my use its excellent."
2,Yet another switch- my 3rd,I just had to install my third switch in this router. And I'm just an after work hobbyist.
4,An Uncommonly Good Mystery,"This was an enjoyable mystery set in rural North Carolina. The main story line in the book revolves around the Norden family and thier pottery. Judge Deborah Knott is sent to Seagrove, North Carolina, to preside over the final property division to finalize the divorce between local potters James Lucas Norden and his soon-to-be-exwife Sandra Kay Norden. But when James Lucas is found gruesomely murdered at the Norden family pottery, Judge Knott finds herself embroiled in the Norden family's drama. This interesting story is full of surprising plot twists.In addition to the well-told mystery, the author weaves in a lot of information about the craft of making pottery.This is the eighth book featuring Judge Deborah Knott. It's the first one that I have read and I definitely plan on going back to the beginning of this series and enjoying them all!"
3,Good Ending,"The most important feature of Margaret Maron's UNCOMMON CLAY is the ending, which points this series in a new direction without getting stale. I missed her family, who are a major feature of the stories.It isn't fair, but I knew this plot from the beginning: two sisters battle over the family possessions and the love of one man. It reads almost like the story of the sisters who inherited Walnut Hall Farms, which after their deaths became the Kentucky Horse Park. Fiction mimics life, but Maron had a good series going with some individual characters who add much to her work.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,"It's ok, but I felt cheated","This book was ok. That's all that can really be said about it. If you have been reading the series and you are really into it, you may have a different feeling. This is the first book of the series that I have read. I do not think it was bad, but I felt cheated. The print is pretty big -- this book should be half its size. I get the feeling that the author ran out of ideas for the series and based a book on research without taking the plot twists as seriously. I really felt cheated by the ending. (I leave you with that to not ruin it.)"
5,WOW! What an asset! Now I feel prepared.,"I am a teacher looking for my first job. I bought this book to help me answer interview questions and to help me get an idea about how to order my room. This book is excellent! I feel more than prepared to go into a new school and room and get ready to go. If interviewers ask me what i would do for a situation, i have answers. This book should have been required reading for my education courses. I'm hooked."
3,A word of warning,"This book only discusses teaching of grades K-6 (something not mentioned by any of the other reviewers). So, if you're planning to teach high school, you'd be best served by a different book."
2,Old school vs. New school,"These toys are quite obviously NOT what fans of the Teen Titans cartoon (Cartoon Network) expect. Beleive it or not, these characters existed LONG ago in DC comics as a sort of 'Junior-Justice League' (see cartoon network cartoon by same name) The monkey is probably supposed to be beast boy AS a beast, the old cyborg's color was really inconsistant, so gold isn't too far off, Raven in white? Starfire with hair too long? While you're here on Amazon, do a search in 'books' for Teen Titans, you will find collections of their old comics with images very similar to the toys you see above.I do agree at least, that these toys are aimed totally incorrectly in terms of audience. They should release figures from the TV show soon."
5,"If you like gut-wrenching rock and roll, this band kicks ass","The fact that this band unfortunatly broke up make this CD a must for any hard-core headbanger!!! If you like John Garcia's vocals you can catch him with his new band Slo Burn. Although not quite as good as Kyuss, it is still a worthy alternative for any true Kyuss fan."
5,How did I miss these guys?,"I just purchased Blues for the Red Sun after a friend introduced me to Kyuss. Over a decade after the album was actually recorded, I took it to be a fresh production. How did I miss them? I have been a fan of the producer, Chris Goss since the first Masters of Reality Album, so how did I not hear of Kyuss when they were active? (I blame the radio and mass media for their delivering the mediocre and wishy washy redundant trash after Cobaine died)Well, who cares? What is really important is that now in late 2010, I am listening to well orchestrated, performed and conducted metal which seems as fresh to me as when I first heard Sabbath or Zepplin in the 70's."
4,A deadset classic marred only by dull production,"Listen to this album through headphones and see what I mean. It just sounds totally flat with no dynamics whatsoever. Seriously, this album could and should be one the world's greatest instrumental sonic delights/assaults.I've just bought Flower Travellin' Band's amazing album ""Satori"", who you could say were a Japanese Black Sabbath. Right after listening to that I put this on and what a difference! I mean that album is over 35 years old and just sounds incredible! ""Blues for the Red Sun"" deserves to sound just as good.The frustrating thing is that all the ingredients are in there already, it's just waiting for a remix. Everytime I hear it, especially the song Freedom Run, I can't help but think of the missed potential."
4,Bosch Router Edge Guide,"This is a very nice edge guide. Bosch tools are easy to setup and use. The quality is beyond what one would expect these days, especially with all the cheap knock-offs from the Orient. Go ahead and spend a few extra dollars and get the good stuff."
5,"Great advice if you have IBS, but are you really sure you have IBS?","For 19 years I suffered from what I thought was IBS. This book helped, but still I did not feel normal.Finally after following a gluten free diet I feel normal again. So if you have IBS, then this book is a must read, but if you have not been tested for Celiac disease or have not tried a gluten free diet, you might want to try it. It could save you many years of trying to figure out what is wrong with your digestive system."
3,A New IBS Solution,"A New IBS Solution. Was given as a gift, so not sure how helpful it will be. Have not gotten feedback from the receiver."
5,Heavy Duty Grinder for the Metal shop,"I own two other 4 1/2 inch grinders besides this one. My Made in China $24 grinder that I was using with a cupped wire brush finally bit the dust. I went looking for Quality this time around and wanted to purchase Made in USA. But this Bosch won out, over a Dewalt, because it was the only one that was a ""true"" all ball / needle bearing construction. It has lots of power and the paddle switch saved my bacon when on a trial run using a metal cutting disk, the disk caught and shattered (I AWAYS wear safety glasses and gloves when grinding). On my other grinders with a thumb switch... that 1/2 second to find the switch & flip it off... would have been too long. Draw backs, the grinder seems to have more vibration and noise than my 8 year old, Made in Japan Ryobi, not to be confused with the new Ryobi, Made in China! Bill G."
5,Good Little Grinder,"Kinda hard to get worked up about an angle grinder--their loud, dirty and smelly. Based on my success with other Bosch tools I purchased this one. It works very well. Appears durable, has a quality metal shield, simple wheel changes, easy on/off and lock switch. I like it. Probably couldn't go wrong with Yellow, Gray, Red or Green versions, however."
5,Super Cute.,"This backpack was very cute. The zipper compartment wasn't very big inside though. You couldn't fit a book inside, only a few small toys. My nephew loved it though."
5,"embracing, practicing, and understanding the courage within us",This book is an excellent journey that allows women to recognize and embrace courage within. I was deeply inspired by Sandra's interviews with women who shared their viewpoints on what it means to be courageous. This book allows women to realistically look at ourselves and begin the journey of recognizing the strengths (courage) that we utilize internally and externally daily.
5,The book that changed my life,"Dear Mr. Thourlby,Thank you for your wonderful no-nonsense guide, You Are What You Wear. I bought a copy of it in a used book store and it has paid off immensely in increased self-esteem, increased respect, and increased income.Like many others I never gave a thought to what clothing ""says"" about a person.Color, style, cut, materials, now all seem to ""talk"" since you have given them a voice.Thank you for making the unspoken words of clothing visible. I now ask, ""What does this tie, shirt, coat, hat, etc. say? Before I will put it on.I just bought your book, ""Passport To Power"", (full price I might add) and hope I enjoy it as much as the other book.Are you still teaching your course at Emory? I would love to attend it."
1,Confirm same playback issues. Do not buy!,"I can confirm same playback issues with menu not working, unable to switch languages (German is default). Can only watch by selecting scene selection. I too will try and return as defective."
1,Should not release this dvd,"You simply can't play this DVD. Click Play 3D menu, nothing happens, click settings, nothing happens. It is so stupid, how can you release a DVD even you can't play it. If you managed to try every button, you may find that chapter button is OK, the only way to play a chapter. The subject is OK, not great. I'll try to return this DVD."
1,does not play,i preordered this in august and eagerly waited 3 months for it to come. was excited when it was shipped. got it and tried to play it. didn't work. i took it out and putit back in quite a few times and still no luck. do not buy this.
3,A Description,"There was no information about this book, it was six bucks, I identify with the phrase ""listening heart"", and so I bought it. Well, it might not have been the most clever purchase of my life. But I thought I'd describe the thing for future curious people.""The Listening Heart Journal"" is a medium-sized, blank, hardcover journal. The cover is pink and purple, with flowers. Inside there is an unattributed paragraph: ""My journal pages, sometimes stained with tears and often penned in early-morning hours, hold treasured fragments from my spiritual journey--the lessons that He taught me, the joy that stirred in my soul, the secret things I told Him, knowing He wouldn't turn away.""As I look back, I see traces of the barren stretches when I could ot speak, and I feel the thrill of new beginnings. I marvel at His leading, find assurance of His love, and am reminded that I am happiest when I am by His side."" The rest of the journal is blank, with lined pink pages.So now you know."
5,Animals in Winter,My students enjoyed this book immensely. We used it as part of our unit studying winter habitats. The illustrations are fabulous. The concept helped my students become nature detectives.
5,It just keeps getting better with each listening,"Others have written far more eloqently than I could on what an incredible set of 8 pieces of music this is. It continues to grow on me with each listening, almost 9 years later, and is easily my favorite of all her CD's, all of which I have. ""The Highwayman"" is so mesmerizing I could listen to it endlessly and not get tired of it.Looking forward to ""An Ancient Muse"" next month with great anticipation."
4,Enticing Music,"Turning poems into a new experiences with her haunting vocals and dream like melodies. An enjoyable album for those who are already aquainted with Loreena mcKennitt or even if you have never heard her music. For lovers of enya, the secret of eden, and David Lanz."
5,A beautiful work from Loreena McKennitt,"She has done it again folks, this album was one of her best I think, her voice is among the angels, I loved her songs Mummers Dance and The Highwayman. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys celtic music"
4,music,Loreena's music is haunting and melodic. Her voice has a soothing quality that is instantly relaxing.Some of the song content is too dark for my taste but the voice and music are wonderful.
5,Lorenas in a class by herself...angelic voice,"When I first heard Mummers dance I didnt know who the artist was. After some investigative work I found Loreena and fell in LOVE with her work, especially the Celtic material. Her voice transported me back to a mediaeval time, haunting and exhilarating at the same time. If you havent experienced Loreenas music, treat yourself. You wont regret it!!!"
1,Songs from the Past,Celtic music in its classic form ...no doubt touches me like a spirit from the past..Loreena's songs fill my heart with a sense of belonging to that past.so long..long ago.. A romantic storyteller...she paints with her words in a classic style.. like the old masters of long ago..
5,the purest sound,magic...as are all her works. This album will leave you haunted and yearning....with a strong desire to read (or reread) the Inferno
3,Loreena is wonderful!,"The only disappointment I had was that the CD contains a different version of ""The Mummer's Dance"" than is heard on the radio. I much prefer that version but otherwise her music is beautiful! Her lovely voice and the lush instrumentation make for a very enjoyable listening experience."
5,"Stunning, sad...","I only came across Loreena McKennitt recently and have been deeply moved by this one album.I don't quite have the ability to explain in wordshow wonderful it is.The best track, I think is Skellig, altho I'm not religious,few songs can bring a tear to one's eye as this one did.As a whole, just an amazing work."
5,The Book of Secrets - The CD of Treasures!,"I feel that Loreena McKennitt is one of the most important composers of our time. She writes musical pieces that I believe the world will treasure forever.She uses her well-ranged, but generally soprano voice in a semi-operatic fashion. Sometimes, she borrows poems from other places and times, and sets them to music. Other times, she writes her own words. But the rich, multi-layered, almost orchestraic music she composes in the background is what really makes her albums brilliant. Not that her voice by itself isn't lovely.This is classy music for rich-hearted music lovers. If you only buy one Loreena McKennitt album, I think The Book of Secrets is the one. But you'd be crazy to buy only one. Buy the rest of them too! And keep them in fancy jeweled cases, showcased prominently in your living room. Because you will soon consider each of them to be a treasure."
1,the worst tea kettle I've ever owned,It drips all over when you pour. the whistle sounds like a dying cat. I can't believe we paid for this. I can't wait to replace it!
1,Too Hot to Handle,"This pot is beautiful. It was a gift. However, you really need a potholder to pick it up after it whistles. My daughter ended up with boiling water all over the shelf as she tried to pour from it and the water came out the hole in the spout. Then we learned you had to flip the spout open before pouring and burned our fingers on the steam.Le Creuset Whistling Teakettle - 1.8 Quart - Red Q3101-67"
3,More miss than hit,"Hearing familiar songs strained through the stylings of a favorite artist can be a thrilling experience. At its best it can provide you with both a reinterpretation of the song and of the artist who's created the cover. Unfortunately, at worst it can show the artist to be bereft of interesting ideas, and add nothing to your understanding or appreciation of the song.Yoakam's all covers album is, unfortunately, more of the latter than the former. Covers of The Kinks ""Tired of Waiting"" and the Beatles ""Things We Said Today"" simply go nowhere. The production strives towards the mixture that would blossom so profoundly on Yoakam's next LP, ""A Long Way Home."" Here, it just sounds disjointed and forced.Not that the album isn't without its charms. The recasting of the Clash's ""Train in Vain"" nearly obliterates the original, and covers of ""Claudette"" and ""Playboy"" stand up nicely.This isn't so much disappointing for its failures as it is for its lack of successes."
3,Meh...,"Good selection. Better than I thought it would be, however, the arrangments are not the arrangements are not those that bobby darin did. These are the original versions of the songs and not the ""vamped up"" Bobby darin versions we've all know and love. Mack the knife plays like it's German minor keyed style..."
2,Not sure how real this was...,"I watched this movie, and was not sure if it was acurate or if it was another attempt to dissolve famous persons from the past. I was not pleased with the presentation and would not recommend this to my family or friends."
2,Good story but damaged dvd,"The dvd had scratches on it. Unfortunately, I did not watch the movie until months after purchasing it. I assume it is too late to return it. A Couple of the scenes did not play. I watched the rest of the video. It was a good story about the search for David Livingston."
4,hmm...,"Well, I will admit that I was a bit skeptical about Anne Perry's (former name: Juliet Hulme). I was turned off by the fact that this woman was convicted of murder as a teenager and felt it might taint my opinion of her writing. But, I went into the novel with an open mind and found that Ms. Perry is a talented writer and I look forward to reading more of her work. I recommend her books."
5,amazing jazz music,this is my first purchase on amazon and im glad to see its a a great store. this disc its a amazing. i love jazz and i have many disc of this great music.sweet sweet music.a pesar de que vivo en mexico mi compra llego en buen estado y puntualmente. viva mexico!!!
3,Not bad but not great,i have used one of these for a few years and it has been a real time saver. beats seting up a compressor even on midsize jobs.pros.-power to sink nails in to hardwood. (i work with alot of oak)-lots of shots to battery and gas-belt clip is handy (clips on most step ladder stays)Cons.-loud-not angled-very tempermental-must be cleaned atleast once daily maybe more if you are shoting alot.-gas is not cheap AND HAS A SHELF LIFE. if you cant use a box in less then a year or it had been sitting on the shelf at the store for awhile it will go bad cusing misfires. CHECK THE DATE ON THE PACKAGE(or canister)-aside from gas and nails you need to buy paslode brand cleaner spray and oil
2,Suction Not Strong,It has no adjustments and the suction lasted 2 hours before the shower head came crashing down. I should have listened to other reviewers.
4,suction is strong,"Suction holds up well! You can screw this permanently into your shower or use the suction cup to adhere it without making holes; I tried the suction cup and have had no problems whatsoever. I wasn't sure it would stick, but I mounted it anyway and nested my shower attachment on it. The holder on this is the right size for a standard attachment and only goes one side up since it's tapered. I have a shower attachment on a long stainless hose, pretty standard but fairly heavy. The suction cup has held firm after several uses of the attachment; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product or purchase it again, should I have a need. With this and a few other products sold on Amazon, you can turn a dull shower into a luxurious, deluxe experience by adding an additional shower head or a wand attachment for 'deep cleaning.'"
3,Beware of shipping problems,"That's the deal, amazon often lack a good packaging for its glasses, really it is a matter of luck....These glasses are beautiful and fragile, do not hesitate to buy, especially from macy's. They have an amazing packaging protocol and I never received anything broken from them....Good luck"
2,not worth it,"This album has a few funny moments, but for the most part it is boring and depressing. The only descent tracks are corduroy blues, dancin' and pantsin', and the goat song. I reccomend Adam's first two albums because of the skits and the original comedy."
5,Door handle,"Part was exact match for my 2000 GMC Sierra, works perfectly, good feel. Product was shipped for free and received quickly, very cool."
4,Pop Pop Pop,Great motor skills motivator. Also an assist with the concept of colors.Easy to grip and manipulate. A big hit with my toddler.
4,Good Study Aid,"I have been reading through the Story of Civilization by Will Durant and though these volumes do have maps, they are not always easy to read and are somewhat limited in scope.I can say that my understanding of history and geography has been greatly helped and enriched by these atlas' AND the scholarship present in the summations of geography, people, culture and chronologically specific movements in medieval times. An excellent resource for the price.Note: These atlas' are much more rewarding when read along side a history book like Will Durant, Toynbee, Herodotus etc. as opposed to all on their own."
1,Bad Idea,This is NOT an authorized Britax car seat cover. Real Britax covers are cuter AND cheaper! Get the real thing!
3,Has a few drawbacks,"Works fantastic in some soils, Plenty of horsepower and mixes the earth to a fine soft texture. Normally it would be a great machine except when trying to till clay soils or soils with vegatation. The reverse turning tines pulls the vegatation to the front and builds up under the deck requiring frequent clean outs. The clay soil builds up under the depth guage and raises the tines out of the ground requiring clean out also.But if you have a clean sandy soil I have found this to be a real good tiller."
5,Perfect fit,"This is the genuine WeatherTech floor liner. It's sold here lower than their own website, and no shipping nor tax for CA. The liner fits perfectly in my 08 Expedition 2nd row. The mat shipped in a box folded in thirds, and it's much lighter than I thought (lighter than the heavy duty rubber mats you find in retail stores). Although I'd prefer the heavy duty kind, the fact that it fits perfectly across the whole floor sold me on this."
4,Where's the TclX reference? No mention of Keyed Lists.,"This book is pretty much the Tcl/Tk bible. If you use Tcl on a regular basis, this book has to be somewhere nearby. However, one BIG disappointment is that this book does not cover TclX what-so-ever. Very useful Tcl eXtensions such as Keyed lists and the associated commands are nowhere to be found! This may not be a big deal to most people using Tcl, however, a large part of the software that I support is written using Keyed Lists and TclX commands. So, I had to go buy the O'Reilly bookTcl/Tk in A Nutshelljust for the TclX reference (Chapter 10). Great job as always on R4 with getting all the new stuff in the world related to Tcl into the book. A request for the next Revision - INCLUDE TclX please!!"
4,Keeping it updated,"Brent seems to keep his book up to date with this 3rd edition. John Ousterhout should have done the same with his, since he ""invented"" Tcl/Tk. But Brent is trying to fill that gap."
4,I paddled this boat 3 miles in rough water,"I went camping recently up in Priest Lake Idaho. I was looking for something to do so I bought this boat, not really realizing that it was a children's toy. I'm 6'3"" so it looks pretty funny when I get in this thing. Everyone thought it was hilarious, it was worth the price just to see my mother laugh so hard. Anyway, I ended up paddling this toy roughly 3 miles through rough water and against the wind and this little boat hung in there. I thought the rubber oar loops were going to rip out from the intense rowing but they never did. I went on to beat it up the next day rowing from one ilsand to the shore and it still held up. I got pulled over by the water sheriff too, he thought it was funny as well.Bottom line, this is a strong little rubber raft. I rowed this thing around until I couldn't life my arms."
5,The best ride at the lake!!!,"I bought 2 of these boats for my kids (3 and 6) to take to the lake. They were a hit!!! The pump was a little slow for impatient young ones, but other than that they were fantastic. They fit 2 people - 10 and under, or 1 adult. I know this because I spent the morning laying in one and had a great time! I loved the fact that the oars couldn't slip out and get lost. The rope at the front made it super easy to pull onto the beach, or tie to the back of the boat. One piece of advice: DON'T pull these behind a motorized boat... the eye for the rope pulled right out, leaving a huge hole, a flat boat and a completely devastated child :( I will be buying 4 or 5 more since all the kids, and adults at the lake LOVED them!!!"
2,"Not a 2-person boat, unless the people are 12-13 years old","The weight limit for this boat is 210lbs. That's ridiculous for a boat that says it's a 2-person vehicle - I even looked up the average height-weight tables to see if I was crazy. The maximum age for two individuals of average weight to fit into this boat, according to its specifications, is 13 years.It seems like it's an ok product within those limitations - the pump worked fine, and all the paddle pieces were there, but I'm rating it low because I would never have bought this model if they had given the proper specs."
1,Slow leak,"I bought two boats for my grandsons birthday, we were going to the mountains, we can not see where it leakes the boys are so sad."
5,GOODBYE TRIAL AND ERROR! HELLO SOLUTIONS1,"Look no further. Goodbye confusion. This book offers step by step instructions on just about everything ranging from money mannagement to home maintenance to personal care to gardening. It's refreshing to find 1001 different tasks and skills explained in such basic fashion. I like the 1-5 scale of difficulty ""hammers"" which highlight for a reader how hard it might be to complete a project. For example; carving a turkey = 3 hammers; caring for silver = one hammer and hitting a home run= five hammers. So stop procrastinating, get the book, roll up your sleeves and tackle that long overdue ""list"" of unfinished projects."
4,Dr. JAC,"I've attended conferences that featured Dr. JAC. I always enjoyed her high-energy creative ideas. She is not afraid to experiment with student writing, helping her students break out of the old paradigm of the 5-paragraph essay. Good book."
4,4 1/2 stars for an excellent French prison oriented film.,"This French film was up for an Oscar but missed out. I also saw ""The White Ribbon"" (which won for best foreign language film) earlier and this is much better. I was a bit uneasy because I don't much care for these prison dramas no matter how good they are. This film certainly begins like I was expecting, but evolves into something else. Kind of a French ""Goodfellas"". That is, plenty of violence, murder and mayhem and yet, our lead character is smart and learns quickly how to survive in prison, and even profit when the time comes. Young actor Tahar Rahim is terrific in the role, transitioning from a scared 19 year old to a brilliant plotter using Arab and Castilian gangsters against each other. My only complaint is the movie is over 2.5 hours, about 30 minutes too long."
3,Arthur Lyman was about 35 years ahead of his time.,"Today this music would fall into the category of ""world music"" or ""New Age"" music. These are, I believe, the first musical recordings to incorporate animal/bird sounds into the music, and you'll enjoy the unabashedly lush quality of its orchestration. It is perhaps best understood as a blend of what came before and after-1940's Hollywood movie music of ""paradise,"" and early '60's jazz. Arthur Lyman is a true original and sadly forgotten, though he still plays his unique style of music in Hawaii. Hawaiian, ethnic, New Age, jazz-it's impossible to pin just one label on him. I suppose, above all, he simply provides a unique listening experience. Try him; I think you'll be hooked."
1,Overpriced for regular socks - nothing special,Just like plain old normal socks. Way too overpriced for not doing anything special. Save your money or just buy some nice wool socks.
2,Truly not like other Smartwool socks,"I've been pinching and scraping to buy Smartwool socks for years. These are the only socks that are comfortable for me in all seasons and they are terrific at keeping my feet warm. However, the socks that I received (womens, cable, black, size 10+ with a thin sole) are horrible. They must be seconds because with the first time through the wash, I found holes in them. Now more and more holes and I'm guessing that it won't be long before they're unwearable. You may find you have a better experience with a different retailer.The padded sole socks have been fine but they aren't for year-round use.Somebody, please sell me decent Smartwool socks!"
4,warm socks,These socks are warm and comfy yet not too thick so they fit easily into most shoes unlike many other wool socks..
3,Meh?,These socks are a good bit thinner than the ones that I have purchased locally. and not as soft. and at the same price?
4,My son LOVES this!,My 3 year old son got one of these a few months ago since he absolutely loves Ben 10. I only paid $15 for it a Toys R Us then another $15 at Walmart after he dropped the first one in a creek. I wouldnt pay anymore than that. Certainly not the $40 + that it is going for right now. Anyway he never took it off and even slept with it on. It makes the exact sound effects as the cartoon so he thinks he is Ben 10. It great for any kid who is a Ben 10 fan!
1,this gun is a mistake,No multiple shoot. Doesnt stop on the end of clip. And whorse one berly shoot 2 inch nails. Head stick out or pin missing head of nail making two holes .
2,Jet 454355 JMJ-1500 1500-Pound Motorcycle/ATV Jack,Very difficult to use on a 750 Shadow ACE. It's lowest height should be an inch shorter and the supports an inch longer. It will BARELY fit the frame.
1,celluloid diaorrhea,"can one find absolutely any redeeming quality in the title's subject matter? I wouldn't think so. And nor could any quality be found with this pesudo avante garde pretend/artsy piece of dog manure. Like a 'street person' I once saw in Westwood Village who was TRYING to be a street person. It just don't work and it stinks, to boot."
