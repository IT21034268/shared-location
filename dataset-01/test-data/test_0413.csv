1,Bad policy.,Who can rate a product that is unavailable? Don't list products you don't have. Good grief!!!!
3,book review,This book is by Bob Clouser. In it he shows you a fly that has his name and how to tie it. The book contains other flies that are versions of the minnow pattern. He just changes material on the fly and calls it something else. The photos are superb the instruction on fly tying are also good. That is way I gave it 3 stars.The book itself is to pricy for what you get. You can get the same info on this fly at youtube for free.
5,Kids video.,Lambchop always captures the imagination of young children and adults. My grandchildren can watch the one-minute stories over and over. The VHS came in great physical condition.
4,Groovalicously Airto,"Airto's vocal phrasing and percussion work both lend themselves well to looping and other remix tricks. IMO, this genre of music tends to make good background audio wallpaper, and much of this work remains true to that notion. While much of Airto's raw solo material tends to draw me in by stimulating my desire to get to the core of his artistic psyche, this remixed product seems to create a distance from any such desires. All in all, this makes for some great background beats."
4,Funky chick - whish I knew what she was saying....,"This woman is incredible. You put her on in the morning as you're readying yourself for the day and you can't help but have a good one. She sounds like a mix of Edie Brickell and Bjork (if you have to put her in a category). The only downfall is that you can't understand what she's on about. You can just tell that the lyrics are just as good as they sound. But, if you're into mystique, this is for you!"
3,Fairly tedious for anyone over 9 years,"Well I took my 6 year old to the cinemas and wasn't expecting much from Grommit look-alikes. Sad to report, there's a lot of non-stop action, hiding a lack of much else going on in the film. The story is tired. Three or four self-conscious laughs, and those all from accompanying adults. Given that my previous excursion to the cinemas was for another brace of scatalogical humour, the hugely entertaining gag from Melbourne, 'Kenny', the letdown was severe, the flushout, complete. There's no problem with cleverness; part of Shrek's hugely populist appeal are the asides and references to other films. But this one just doesn't cut it, and the references present as mere cliches. And you are on risky ground when you adopt a lookalike Grommit cartoon style. Inevitably it will recall the original, and the creative art has to be impeccable to warrant such an echo. Here, we recall Grommit and measure everything this lacks, intimacy, patience, and crucially, loving detail."
5,If you had to own a DVD,This one is a good addition to any collection of fine animation combined with a good story line. This movie is not for little children though because I have shown it to kids under 5 and they all seem to be frightened by some parts. Adults can enjoy this as well.
5,Flushed Away,Very cute movie that the entire family will enjoy. The little worm things are cute with the noises they make. Had a lot of laughs throughout the entire movie. I would highly recommend.
3,I can't review it because........,"Polstein's failed to ship it since it was out of stock and they never bothered to notify me. They said it was shipped but it wasn't until 2 weeks later that I leanred it was out of stock - and I HAD TO MAKE THE CALL TO THEM! After 15 minutes of arguing with a girl who claimed it was shipped, she left me on hold for 12 minutes to tell me it was NOT shipped and it was out of stock and discontinued. Never again would i buy from POLSTEIN'S!"
2,cute but...,"I enjoyed the developing relationship betwen Sinclaire and Quincy. But I have to agree that the masquerade went on too long. After all, just about everyone figured it out after chapter 4 so the story line bcome boring. Also, I wish the author had been more descriptive of what they both looked like. Early on I was clueless as to what they looked like. An epilogue would not have been out of place for this story. Did Sinclairs Mom get married or Mel? How did Sin and Quincy do a few years down the road? Did she continue her unreal ability to pick stocks and make them as rich as the Fricks?"
3,Ran out of gas,"I started off liking this book, but as I read, I started to get impatient for Quincy to shed her disguise. The girl masquerading as a man never really appealed to me and I think it went on too long. I liked Sinclair, but I think he could have been a tad more alpha. I never got a real good picture of him, either. I don't think the author described him physically very well. I always want to get a good picture of the characters in my head and I didn't with him. So, I just pictured Gerard Butler from Phantom! One of the themes was that Jo had ruined herself from ever being married, but once it was decided that she would marry Sinclair, she went right along and didn't seem to have any problems. This book was okay, but the premise didn't really appeal to me, so I was probably a little pickier that usual. I hope the author writes a straight-forward romance the next time, where the woman is a woman from the get go."
5,Great assortment,This product comes with a great number of flat faucet washers. I actually bought it to get one washer to fix my Keureg My KCup adapter. Have had no issues and have plenty left over for extras.
4,Nice but shrinks!!!,"These homespun tablecloths are absolutely beautiful. They are a lovely weight and drape beautifully. However they REALLY shrink. I washed mine in cold water and did NOT put if anywhere NEAR the dryer. But it shrank up to the point where it doesn't fit my table. More than 5%. WHY oh WHY can they not pre-shrink the cotton? Or, alternatively, why can they not make the tablecloths larger so that you can allow for shrinkage and still have them fit your tablecloth? Oh well. I tried. I now have about a 1 inch drop (not enough) on my tablecloth and I had to do a lot of wet stretching... followed by ironing with a steam iron afterwards (not because of wrinkles... there were none... but to try to stretch it some more). So, I have mixed feelings about this tablecloth. If it had shrunk only an inch or so on each side I could have lived with that."
3,Good Deal,"It works as expected, and was not overpriced like some others. Only wish the 1/8' plug had less plastic on it, not good for multiple connections on a pc, seems to be pushing each other. Still works fine though."
5,Samsung Pro815 - Blows Competition Away!!!,"First of all, this camera has every feature any beginner - intermediate - professional photographer could ask for. The macro / zoom capabilities are outstanding, with a little practice and use of tripod or a patient steady hand. The use of the top lcd (waist level) is the best way to shoot low level shots, otherwise the rear lcd is fine for everything else. Too many features to list, (read the manual for all the features) but the main one is the shots this camera produces are excellent. I do suggest using photoshop for editing, as any good photographer will attest to. Want to see many more photos taken with this camera? see: [NekoPhoto . com] Big Bang for the Buck is what this camera is all about!"
5,GREAT BUY,"I'm no professional camera user myself, but this camera has such a crisp quality of taking picture, and it really teaches you how to focus and time your shots when using the manual zoom. It takes brilliant pictures, has great camera life, and I always have room on the memory card it came with for more picture.The only thing that's a little bit of a nitch is that the top screen is hard to use when your doing manual focus becuase its soo small, and that the eye finder is digital so its not like an SLR but other than that it absolutely rocks and is a GREAT buy!"
5,A great new perspective,"Though I am not a very religious person, I really enjoyed this bok for its fresh new perspective I would recommend this book to religious, non religios and people of non christian religions for a refreshing new look at GOD a.k.a. the boss"
4,Recommended for religious and Non-religious alike,"Those who consider religion/spirituality an important part of their lives would be well advised to read this book. It's short, but it says a lot, and is quite thought-provoking."
5,Music theory book review,I found this book to be very comprehensive. A great resource for teaching music theory. I have been teaching music for over 10 years and have found this to be the most complete and user friendly theory resource so far.
1,Transparency Needed,"Music Lovers,This book is not a stand alone book it say complete version but in reality it is not. You need to buy another book to find the answer, then.you need to buy again, their CD's to listen to ear training. Beware of this kind of business strategy that will end up, you buying their 3 products to learn little. You can buy one book with CD for half the price of these three books.They should give WARNING telling the buyer that they need to buy another sets to complete their music education.If there is zero star I will give this book zero rating"
3,Doesn't live up to the Neil Gaiman Hype,"The intro by Neil Gaiman about just how great this book is left me disappointed, when, by the end of the book I was still waiting to be swept away like I expected based on the glowing review by Gaiman. Enjoyable but in like a B-/C range."
2,Band impossible to clean up,"I like how this watch looks and feels on the hand. However, the wrist band gets dirty during normal daily use and is impossible to clean it up. I tried various soaps, alcohol, and lighter fluid. I tried almost anything that came across my mind, just name it. It was so annoying that I stopped wearing it after 2 weeks. Now I have nice looking watch with horrible wrist band sitting in my drawer. 2 stars for huge disappointment. If you are fussy about your wrist band (as I am), stay away from bright coloured ones."
5,My fiance loves it!,To see the look of joy on his face is well worth it. He is so proud! He can't wait to go diving again
1,Nautica Men's NST Chronograph Watch #14538G i just received the package with my order and the watch was not in the box!!!,"Nautica Men's NST Chronograph Watch #14538G i just received the package with my order and the watch was not in the box!!! how can i stand this? i took me days waiting and finally got nothing!, what can i do now??????"
5,This is just what our program was looking for,"This is a clearly presented overview of grieving in adults with developmental disabilities that we have made the centerpiece of our curriculum on grieving. Our program serves adults with developmental disabilities with residential, work, and developmental day programs. This book is used to orient staff to the grieving process, help them to know how to respond, and to plan activities for the people served by our program. I think that the large section on particular activities to help people work through grieving is unusual in this type of book and very practically useful."
2,Hard to use part,You can only use this chain if you disassemble the engine. Chain is not taken apart so you can attach it to old chain and run it through engine.
3,"Not their best work, but definitely cool.","Let's face it kids: Miller and McFarlane are two of the most talented (or at least popular) people to ever work in the comic medium. And this is, hands down, the BEST Spawn/Batman crossover there is. Is it a bit short on plot? YES. Is the artwork a bit too flashy in places? OH, YES. But, as a crossover book, this is definitely top draw for my dollar. Nobody writes either Spawn or Batman as well as Frank Miller, and he manages to pull through in most cases here. McFarlane's artwork is, well, McFarlane's, so if you don't like it, don't pick this one up. But if you're a fan of either Miller or McFarlane, and if you have a real interest in how these two characters would interact (which is really what this is about, not the villian), then this book is definitely worth your money."
1,Batman adapted for Spawn's world.,"Spawn comics are typically thin emotionally. Since hischaracter is pretty awfully constructed, Batman has to dumb himselfdown to fit into his comic book. The colors are garish, the dialogueis awful, and the layouts stink. As others have said, the pinups(i.e. every panel) are cute. The inside back cover is a dedication toJack Kirby, which, when you think about it, is absolutelyhilarious. Frank Miller is an enigma; it seems that he has a severecase of multiple personality disorder... hopefully, his forthcomingsequel to ""The Dark Knight Returns"" will be written on agood day."
4,Can we combine this with Batman/Spawn: War Devil?,"This story had all the hallmarks of a great Batman tale. The dialogue was fresh, gritty, and totally Batman--Frank Miller style. Plus, with McFarlane's art, how can you go wrong? When you try to include the plot. While the dialogue and interaction between Spawn and Batman make this a must-read for diehard fans, the plot is severely uninteresting. Ironically enough, in the other crossover, War Devil, the plot is the only good point in an art-poor, dialogue-poor story. So if we could just find a way to combine the two, we'd have a seriously good Batman story. Anyway, the comic's worth the money, just to see Batman go toe-to-toe with a demon from hell and hold his own. Not to mention all the great one-liners and Batman quotes. Oh yeah, and Mr. Arrogant's art isn't too bad, either."
1,The Luftwaffe War Diaries,THIS BOOKS TITLE IS A GROSS MISLEADING OF ITS ACTUAL CONTENTS.There is no where in this book were you will find Pilots or ground crews writings or thoughts on daily life in the Luftwaffe.Its contents are a very good history of the Luftwaffe's rebirth in the 30's through the wars conclusion in 1945.VERY INFOMATIVE BOOK BUT BY NO MEANS A DIARIE.
5,Oustanding product,"This guide was invaluable as we searched for areas where we wished to live. A must have for anyone relocating to San Diego, CA."
1,This book never told the truth,"This book was slanted to create confusion. The truth behind this incident was never fully disclosed to the public. Yes, Mr. Tarkanian is a great coach, but the picture that prompted the entire deal was never about him. The reason why the picture appeared in the public is a greater story than you could ever imagine, and no one thought of asking the right questions. Mr.Yaeger missed many of the facts with his own interpretation of reality, but that's what a scandel is all about? Some day the true story will be told!"
2,Get the stick blam,"Sorry, I bought this and didn't like at all. The consistency of the balm is too solid to easily use from a jar without poking your finger into the balm, flaking it and causing a hole, and once on lips I find I have to smooth out flakes. Actually I've also tried 2 varieties of their lip balm in sticks, and liked those. The consistency is just better in stick form."
2,Not compatable with other apps.,"The biggest let down is that you can't access the dictionary from any other programs or the web. The company claims it integrates with ms word, but I just receive errors when it tries to work with ms word. Also, you can't paste a word you want to look up into the search box you have to type it in instead -which takes more time. The definitions are shorter than I was expecting. I do not recommend this product."
3,"Could be better, but it does work with MS Word","Definitions not as subtantive as I was expecting. However, the program intergrates well with my MS on 2000 O/S and XP Platform. I believe some are having problems because they may not be following the wizard closely and downing loading those specified files into the ""START"" file of the Word program."
2,There are better guides available,"Jonathan Feldman has done a good job at putting together a reasonably entertaining and fairly easy read here. The problem with it is that there are far too many errors, and the information that IS correct is not explained very well. My learning and experience as a CCNA gave me a solid understanding of most of this material, fortunately. I bought this book for a quick review of the major exam objectives, which it provided well enough. My previous knowledge, however, made apparent the very large gaps, lack of explanation or background, and relatively poor concept treatment contained in this book. Bottom line: If you have a firm knowledge of networking already, this book may be a humorous and quick review of the salient points. However, if you already are that prepared, there's nothing you will gain from this book anyway. For the less experienced, I'm afraid the information contained in Mr. Feldman's guide will ony serve to confuse. There are better guides available."
4,good,"Good research into the lives of the famous couple. it gives them more depth, especiall Anne Morrow and her story."
1,Where to find Vitalogy 1900 version?,"Does anyone know where one could attain the Vitalogy 1900 version? If you do please inquire about it. I have tried online and libraries, which have lead me to a dead end."
5,Excellent,"Done when it was far from sure we were going to win WW II. This is an extraordinary dramatic portrayal of the ""last stand"" US and Filipino forces made on Bataan. Of course it is not a docudrama straining for accurarcy, that could come after we won. This was a depiction of a varied group of Americans and Filipinos coming together in a hopeless situation to do as much as they could (remind anyone of Flight 93?). Of course there actually were rear guard actions and delaying actions as the Japanese advanced on Bataan so in a way you could say it does stand for unknown heroic acts by the defenders. Interestingly when units are mentioned in the film they are the real units that fought in the Philippines in '41-'42. I would also recommend ""Eve of Saint Mark"" which addresses the same issues and has a great performance by Vincent Price but I have never seen a copy offered for sale and am afraid it is a lost gem."
5,took my breath away!,"I have had real diamonds and everything in between. These moissanite earrings have more fire and sparkle than my real diamonds - literally took my breath away when I opened the box! In the past, the CZ studs I have had, got scuffed & scratched and lost that initial sparkle after a few weeks. These moissanite studs, have kept every bit of brilliance as they did when I first opened them. The 1.5 carat size I was concerned might be too big and look fake because of the size, but they are actually the perfect size. Don't hesitate to buy them - they are a great deal. With moissanite, who needs real diamonds?"
3,Track list...,"Here's a list of the tracks on this album:The Message, Brothers on the Slide, Dove, Bra, Fug, For Baby Woh, Rickshaw, Equitorial Forest, Listen, Getting It Back, Anthracite, Willy's Headache, Genevieve, Pon de Dungle, Rastafarian Folk Song, One More, Zion I"
1,Didn't work like typical Mach 3 blades,"My husband loves Mach 3 so when these went on sale, we didn't hesitate to purchase. These were horrible. He didn't not get a good shave and he tore his skin to pieces. He thought maybe he just got a bad blade so he tried a second one in the pack....same thing. He ended up buying something else at the store because these were unusable. I would not buy again."
4,gillette blades,"been using for years and they get close shave never cut you, and are great for sensitive skin. Never had a reason to change always good results."
3,Average blades,I have been using these blades for a month now. One blade can give you 5-7 shaves. After 3 or 4 (depending on your hairs etc) it starts to wear down. Overall I will rate it at average quality.
1,unacceptable Gillette Mach3 razor blades,"I found this product of inferior quality, blades are dull before I started shaving. I wrote an e-mail describing my complaint and ask for satisfaction guarantee policy. I was gratified to receive an immediate answer indicating that my charge account was being refunded the full amount of the cost of the order. I am expecting my June MC statement to reflect that credit. Thank you."
2,Not as good as they used to be.,"The other reviewers are onto something... These razor cartridges are not the same quality as they used to be. Some people are saying they're counterfeit; I doubt that's the case but I think they may be just another case of corporate cost-cutting. I used to get a couple of weeks or more out of a cartridge. Now I get a few days before they're shot and my skin starts getting irritated and cut. I'm searching for a new razor but they're all so darned expensive, I'm not really sure if there's anything better or cheaper out there."
1,"Poor quality, not like store-bought blades","The other low reviews are right, these blades are cheap but terrible. I just went back to blades from the store, and what a difference! Now I can get 7 great shaves instead of 3-4 bad to awful shaves. Amazon needs to change their supplier, these blades are either fakes or manufactured to specs different from those meant for the US market, and we (the customers) are being ripped off."
5,Underrated,"Very underrated Doors' album. Although it does not contain any ""hit"" songs, true Doors' fans will be pleased with this album. The song ""The Soft Parade"" is reason enough to own it."
1,a real stinker of a Doors album...-the one to avoid..,"Okay, I'm usually very liberal when it comes to rating cd's I just purchased.Fortunatley, i didnt buy this.it's so embarrasingly bad. Whatever you do...NEVER PLAY THIS AT A PARTY..ALL YOUR FRIENDS WILL THINK YOURE A DORK, AND NEVER RETURN YOUR CALLS! It really sucks that bad. There's classic DoorsFIRST ALBUM, STRANGE DAYS, WAITING FOR THE SUN, MORRISON HOTEL AND LA WOMAN.you cannot go wrong with any of those cd's. They ALL ROCK! but unfortunately the doors recorded and released this piece of audio dirrahea. I'd say Touch Me is the nly memorable track..and thats being nice. The rest sucks bad!!Stay away from this one at all costs."
5,"As always, the ""underrated album""","Always considered a ""rushed album,"" and not up to the Doors' ""real potential,"" I totally disagree with the critics. This CD is full of great songs. From the radio friendly hit, Touch Me, to the poetic masterpiece, The Soft Parade, this album does not disappoint. I guess people dislike this album because ""it wasn't like the others,"" but the fact of the matter is that no two Doors' albums were alike. And that's the beauty of The Doors. Their music never sounded like a broken record because every song was unlike the other. Just buy the CD, you won't be disappointed..."
1,What were they thinking?,"There are only two tracks on this cd that I like: ""Wild Child"" and ""Wishful, Sinful."" The rest is, as one reviewer put it, schizophrenic. Judging from the cover, even The Doors themselves seem to be shying away from this album."
3,I have to disagree...,"Running the risk of getting flamed here, I am afraid to say I disagree with most of the comments made.I consider this album to be their worst work, out of their studio albums.I would say only 'Touch Me' saves it..."
3,Excellent Story - Rip Off Printing,"This is one of Edgar Rice Burroughs' best stories. However, this is just the first half of the story! Wildside Press has gone back to the magazine version, and printed just the first half of the story of Billy Byrne. The book commonly known as THE MUCKER also contains the second half which was published in magazine form as ""The Return of the Mucker"". $32 for half the story? What a rip off!"
3,Expected More of a Difference,"I received this shampoo (along with the conditioner) a week ago. Thus far, I have used them my last three hair washes.While I do notice a positive change in the texture of my hair (it is also shinier and easier to manage) there is minimal difference in my scalp condition.I have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes. So far, I have noticed little improvement in this.While I do feel some relief while I am washing my hair, since the product leaves a ""cool"" feeling on your scalp, afterwards, the itching is still there.I was hoping that by now, I would start to notice a change in this aspect. Maybe I should give it a while longer."
3,Mildly Satisfied,"The product smells great, and you can tell it's different from other shampoos. However, it didn't work as well as some more chemically inclined products such as T-Gel. If you don't want those chemicals, this is for you."
1,Oh my,"I am sorry, but this was so awful that after one bite we had to throw it out. It tasted like lard mixed with some strange polymer flavor, like Tupperware or something. What a waste of 15 bucks! I wish I could give it a negative stat."
1,A Word from the Author,"Hello, I'm the author of God and Coffee: in that order and I wanted to let you know about my new gift product line, Thank God for Friends. If you would love to send a gift that is sure to touch someone's heart, please check out, thankgodforfriends.com. You will find, Thank God for Friends coffee mugs (Some days are bad hair days... Thank God for Friends - and more) coffee, cards, and of course, more copies of God and Coffee: in that order. I look forward to hearing from you.Kristina Seymour"
1,Not What I Expected,Disappointed in the lack of detail and very small scales of foreign country maps.
3,Good Recipe Book,The book illustrates how to use the Access 97 Software. But the cookbook approach may leave you completely in the dark about what you did or why you did it.You'll need other books to deal with the intricacies of relational databases or visual basic objects.
2,It would be better with a functional CD,"As with an earlier reviewer, my CD was no good. More specifically, it would mount but not install. The book is so geared to the CD that it is not worth much without a functioning CD. Too bad! The book looks very good in other ways."
1,Ho-Hum,"This book tells the story of one of the other main survivors of Flight 815. It has very little to do with LOST other than a few chance encounters with the main characters we've come to know and love. The plot was weak and repetitive. The flashback part seems to end in mid-story. Although I rated this book One Star, I would not recommend this book (there was no rating less than One Star!)."
3,An ok companion,"If you are looking for a book to read and aren't obsessed with LOST like I am, this isn't the book for you. I liked it because its something short to read and its interesting how mixed in parts of the show you can't see on tv. i.e. like how Locke found out Sayid and Kate were going on an excursion to set up the transcievers. The actual storyline of the book was quite predictable, though. Yet, it does give a Lost freak (Like me) a fix, until the next show."
3,Good for one time read,This book was not as interesting as poisoned pins. I hope the author finds a better boy friend for Claire Malloy than The CID Inspector Peter Rosen as he seem to have no depth of character. I eagerly await to read the next mystery.
5,Granddaughter's Delight,"This purchase was a Christmas present for our 13 year old granddaughter who is very keen on graphics and art and who already had the 6 inch product. But she is truly delighted with the 12 inch version especially praising its sensitivity to touch on the stylus. On the other hand, she finds that the third party software accessories that work with the product do not measure up to the same standard."
5,all serious psychotherapists should read this book,"This is basically a ""how-to"" manual detailing one of the few ""empirically validated treatments"" for major depression - i.e., a treatment that really, truly helps. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is as effective as either Beck's cognitive therapy or antidepressant medications. Since every therapist encounters depression on a regular basis, how can you justify ignorance of this (short-term!) approach? The book is readable and well organized; someone already trained in psychodynamic psychotherapy could probably improve clinical practice based on the book along, though specialized training would surely be helpful as well. The approach makes sense to patients, too!"
3,Too Big for many,"This is a big watch.. Really big. Looks fine, but you need a big wrist for it to look right. If not, it will look like a make believe watch on a child.Works fine, but its just too darn big for many people."
4,Half-and-Half,"Judy Collins / Whales & Nightingales: Half of this album is remarkable (""Sons of"", ""Farewell to Tarwathie"", ""Amazing Grace"", and others) while the other half is simply uninspired (""Song for David"", ""The Patriot Game"", ""Prothalamium"", and others). At least the uninspired songs are good enough to sit through until you get to the excellent cuts. Just enough good music to give it four stars."
4,The best of UK R&B,"While UK hip-hop still has not set the world on fire, British R&B artists are building an impressive track record - just check for Mica Paris, Desree and Omar. If you liked Donnell Jones ""Where I wanna be"" then chances are you'll love this joint by Lynden David Hall. The grooves have the same mellow flavour, with silky smooth vocals and nice guitar licks. I understand that Lynden received a lot of support in this project from legendary UK R&B dj Trevor Nelson. Nice one Trevor! Check out Trevor's compilation album: INCredible Sound of Trevor Nelson on Sony Music."
5,A heart warming ethnographic work from the Southwest USA,Ronnie's work on this book has given many of us a glimpse into the infrastructure of the cultural dimensions of the peoples that have lived and are still very much alive in the areas of Northern Mexico and The American Southwest.
3,"You get what you pay for, and it is a bargain...","You can spend much more than this on a better foot support, so keeping the budget price in mind, I will only report that this unit is not very durable. The toe lever control is very touchy and place in such a way that is easily tripped, thus unlocking the setting that you've set it to. That's a reasonable annoyance, given that this is an inexpensive product, but within a few months of having it, both toggles holding the toe lever snapped off (they're made of cheap, molded plastic), rendering the lever useless. Now, in order to adjust the support, I have to pick it up, and manually set the locking mechanism from underneath the unit -- and even then then, it pops out of the locked position, periodically. I'm a fairly large person (size 12 feet, 240 lbs), so that's probably a factor, too, but just keep in mind that you'll get what you pay for on this item, and nothing more. Thus, my ""okay, but..."" rating."
2,Works well but smells really bad,"I have short legs so them sometimes ache if I dont use a foot stool. The foot rest works very well. But the rubber odor is gross. I have tried everything, I've left it outdoors - in the sunshine. I washed it with water, bleach, perfume, talcum powder. That's one stubborn odor, but it is still unbearable."
1,Don't buy this footrest,"I've had 2 of these break within a short period of use. It has a foot pedal to lock the angle in place, but the foot pedal is not very sturdy, the plastic breaks and footrest no longer locks, just slides constantly."
3,"It's good, but not great.","I just bought this, and I must say, for the money, it's an okay product. It's definitely not the same quality foot rest I have in my office (which is probably much more expensive), but it's not terrible either. When it is at its lowest setting, it's very sturdy, but when it's raised to its full height, it feels rather flimsy, like the plastic might break if you put much pressure on it. One other thing, and maybe it's just me, but I find the really strong smell of rubber from the tread to be rather gross. I haven't had a product with this problem before. It smells like bicycle tires. I hope that fades with time."
2,"Cheaply constructed, broke down after 3 months of use.","Looked nice and sturdy from the outside, but the inside mechanism is very cheaply designed. The lock to hold the footrest in place broke down after just 3 months. I've had to ""ghetto-style"" it just to make it semi-functional.Steer clear, piece of garbage."
3,"Smells Bad, But Everything A Foot Rest Could Be","This has all the adjustable features you would want for a footrest. The quality of the platic is great.However, the rubber that your rest your feet on smell so bad that I'm sure whoever makes this footrest will have cancer. I had to leave it in the garage for days before I could use it and I'm sure to not put my bare feet on it. Lawyers, have at it."
3,Serviceable,"This product is basically what I was looking for, so overall I'm glad I purchased it. I only have one complaint -- it's a little too easy to 'unlock' it so that the tilt position can be moved. I wish it was more difficult to tap that button."
2,Cheaply made - broke after a week,"I used this product for a week until it broke. All I did was roll my chair up toward my desk when one of the chair's rollers bumped against the adjustable foot pedal in the front and broke the plastic surrounding the pin that kept it in place. Now I cannot use it at all as the angle adjustment will not lock, so I'll be returning this item. All other parts seem to be fairly well made but unfortunately, the weakest part of the construction is also one of the most critical."
1,Order this if you want a disgusting smelly piece of used rubber,"I was so extremely disappointed by this, what I thought was a simple purchase of a footrest for my desk at work. Inside the UPS box, I received an already opened box from which I pulled out a smelly disgusting used footrest with dirt and scuff marks all over the top. After I read another one-star review for this item I was shocked to see that I was not the first person this had happened to. I will always take the time to read one-star reviews now on items even if it seems like a simple and cheap purchase."
4,Great footrest,"I bought one for work and really liked it. No smell as others had. Since it's on carpet, it doesn't move. The adjusting pedal locks decently so I didn't have a problem with it adjusting itself. I adjusted it to a comfortable angle and it really takes pressure off my feet (I have a nerve issue).So I bought one for home. That one had an odor issue (either the glue or the material puts off a chemical smell). It's mostly (but not completely) dissipated - it seems to be the luck of the draw whether yours smells. The one here is on a plastic chair mat and moves a little across the floor if you put forward pressure on it. I found a good spot on the mat and it doesn't move anymore. The second one's pedal also locks well and the rest itself doesn't self adjust while my feet are on it.Overall, good foot rest, it does its job. 4.5 stars."
1,worse than useless,For a start you get error messages in GermanThis is possibly the worst piece of software I have ever bought ! give you a clue you set in the size of your apartment then add a room which is then larger than the whole floorplan don't be fooled by the headlines it's 100% useless oh sorry it has one use ....... raising your blood pressurergdsseasoned software user
3,Carly gets into the race,"I never really got into this Album. I bought it after ""Boy's in the Tree's"" came out,along with all the other Carly Simon Albums I didn't buy over the years.The only song that I could still play to this day is the hit,""That's the way I've always heard it should be,"" It's so mysterious. And after reading about Carly's family,and her Mother having a younger lover living in there house,while there Father was Ill,I thought she wrote the words,but it was Jacob Brackman,Carly wrote the Music.I was working in the Summer while I was in high school when this record came out,and I couldn't stand it. Now its one of my favorites."
3,Buy Happy Secret Instead!!!!,"Of course this is not a bad CD, it's quite reasonable; but it's completely unrepresentative of how gorgeous the music of the Lucksmiths really is.The songs just lack that something extra, the magical quality.Buy the Happy Secret CD instead, you'll be glad you did."
3,Worth a listen for fans only,"This is not as good as ""All live and all of the night"" in terms of sound quality and post production, but the very strong set list makes it worth a listen nonetheless"
1,Bad tape,"this is the first used dvd item i bought from amazon that was terrible, i played it for a few minutes then it just stop playing. we was on a road trip and my kids was so mad. My husband said you should call that person and tell them them that he knew that dvd wasnt any good. After this i dont think i will buy anymore dvd's."
3,Mediocre,"Madagascar is a mediocre movie. Not the best when it comes to family entertainment.The CGI is great (especially with the details in it) The casting is ok. A lot of good names. The problem is the plot. It's boring and has no bunch. The jokes are lame (maybe because I'm not 10) While other movies have jokes for parents and kids, this movie doesnt seem to have them. Madagascar needs to be a funnier movie."
1,Missed by a mile!,"What a joke this film is, and I don't mean in the funny sense! I don't recall the last time I was this disapionted with a film.Having waited for what seemed like a year for the release of this movie I rushed the the cinema and bought my ticket.I nearly left half way through and demanded my money back!The jokes are unfunny and the actors doing the voices (Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer) are just hopeless.With the quality animated films being released these days (Shrek 1 and 2, the Incredibles etc...) DreamWorks should hang their heads in shame!Aviod this film at all cost it's terrible!No Really it's TERRIBLE!"
5,So cute!,"It's rare a movie comes along that is good for both kids and adults. This one does it beautifully! I wish they made stuff like this when I was a kid! The animation is amazing, the celebrity voices are funny, the plot simply HILARIOUS! Sheltered zoo animals suddenly find themselves on an island...The rest is just pure joy! A fun movie I would watch again and great for all ages."
4,Great Buy,"A nice movie, even if it is more children oriented, it turned out to be something the entire family could enjoy."
4,Good Movie. No Pixar.,It's hard to compare any animated film to any of the Pixar films but this is still a great movie for kids and adulst to enjoy together.
5,great kids movie,The movie was delivered as expected and in pristine condition. It is a very good movie for our grandchildren. It contains humor targeting adults as well.
3,More could have happened,"Madagascar is a very funny movie. Seeing animals like a zebra, a giraffe and a lion behave like people is always funny, especially when voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer (who was funnier then I would expect). On Madagascar it's Sasha Baron Cohen (Ali G) who steals the show.The animation is perfect, never have seen animals move in such a way.Another very funny thing are references to other movies like Planet of the Apes, American Beauty and the Matrix.The only thing is... the story is flimsy, there is really not that much happening. If you read other reviews you will have a very good understanding of the story, it's really sad that such great animation has been made for such a flimsy storyline."
1,Shrek?,"I thought we had a winner,With all the great actors,How could we not?Yet I was dreadfully disapointed,It was a load of garbage,A Shrek wanna-be, would be the term.Perhaps it was the trailers,The oh so promising trailersPerhaps it was the publicty,That made people say "" Go and buy it!""Or last but not least the penguins,Who were supposed to be dreadfully witty,But turned out to be ,Nothing be a Shrek wanna-be.The facts were all wrong,And the plot was screwy,I fell asleep at seven different parts,Not a good family movie,You could almost hear,"" See Me! We wanna make money!""Some parts, you could tell were supposed to be silly,But came off as a dud,It made no sense, none at all.Thought much more sense that this piece of rot.Even thought it has Stiller,You really shouldn't see it.Unless, you want an easy nap.Demotheseas"
1,Madagascar was made for adults watching with their kids rather than kids,"This was never designed for kids to watch alone. Much of the movie has adult oriented jokes and scene reproductions from older adult movies that kids simply just wouldn't get (For example; drug induced hallucinations). For kids it offers cartoons acting silly and has questionable entertainment value and certainly little real educational or learning value.I as an adult give it three stars as i rather enjoy lemurs calling other animals ""Pansies"" and the penguins are very funny but for kids it is one star."
4,I like to...,Everyone loves this film already...but once you see it in blu-ray...WOW! The colors just jump off the screen. I suggest anyone and everyone to buy blu-ray especially when it comes to any pixar film.MOVE IT!
4,Great for the family...,"Madagascar is a cute and funny movie. Parents and kids were laughing through most of the movie. (there was an little while where the story gets boring.) But, I love the penguins and the fact that they are always so sneaky; they really steal the show from the main characters. If you have kids this is a definite must see, we had kids laughing the whole time and most loved the bright colors, music and especially dancing. You saw a lot of little kids dancing in their chairs. People without kids or older kids will also enjoy the movie as it has a lot of jokes for adults to keep us entertained and laughing; the bright colors are also great for us as well as the dancing and music. I felt this cartoon lived up to its previews and the way it was perceived. My only hope is if they do a 2nd one that they include more of those sneaky penguins."
1,WHY DO ANIMATED FILMS SUCK NOWADAYS ?,"I have lost almost all respect for animated films these days, and this movie is the likely cause for this epidemic of bad animated movies. Seriously, this movie is pretty piss-poor by what I expect from an animated movies. This movie is hardly funny by any means and is just flatout stupid as hell. The animal characters are very annoying and why was R&B music included ? The story is a disaster, the plot just pisses me off, and the dialogue is a travesty. If you truly like movies avoid this pile of poisonous suckage."
2,Good for kids. Adults should bring something to read.,"My daughters (7 and 10) liked it, although many of the jokes went over their heads. We parents thought it was okay, but pretty unexciting. A few of the images are fairly macabre (e.g. skeletons in a crashed plane fuselage), and potentially disturbing to the young set. Overall, my advice is to stay home and watch the Incredibles on DVD."
3,A little dull around the middle,".......it isn't very often that the first 30 minutes of a movie are the best............nonetheless, a cute little movie."
2,Another Sub-Par Dreamworks Production,"It's a shame this movie was below average. The animation was very good. Like Shark Tale, it had it's moments, but it didn't work as a movie. Dreamworks seems to have the problem to accommodate the actors with the characters instead of the other way around. Did the zebra really have to look like Chris Rock? Please. Ben Stiller was uninspired as was Ross from FRIENDS. Again Like Shark Tale, the actors ruined the movie. The story had potential but ultimately fell flat. The only good Dreamworks production was Shrek Two.I know there is always the comparison between Dreamworks and Pixar but Pixar is by far the better company. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters, Inc. all have two things going for it: imagination & great story telling. They don't have to rely on second rate comedy to get laughs unlike Madagascar."
4,Madagascar is a great movie for the whole family.,We bought the movie for a trip to visit family and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even my mother watched it with us. I would have given five stars but the DVD version does not include a cartoon short feature with the penguins as we had hoped.
5,The Only Alarm Clock,My husband used to have six alarm clocks. I got on the net and found this alarm with a shaker. Then one day it gets knocked off in the floor and busted.The alarm clock was about five years old. So we had to take turns staying up to get him up for work.Then this alarm clock arrived.It works great.So those of you who have those husbands like mine.That could have the house knocked down around him and never wake up.You need this alarm clock.
1,Receiver did not work,"We bought this alarm clock to work with a baby monitor signaller made by the same company. When we plugged both of them and turned the receiver function on the clock went crazy: flashing lights, shaking bed, etc. It turns out that ""sometimes"" there is another signal in the houses electrical system that can interfere with the receiver. The Sonic Alert website said we could send it in and get them adjusted to another at a cost of $5 each plus $7 shipping. We did that, and now when we turn the receiver on it just vibrates and buzzes even if the signaller isn't plugged in.Otherwise, it's an ugly alarm clock. The vibrating puck doesn't wake my wife up and the light feature gets ""stuck"" sometimes.Don't buy it."
4,Good investment,"I sleep like a rock and Ive tried at least 5 other alarm clocks none of which seemed to do the trick. I even have the clocky alarm clock that rolls around but still I managed to snooze through everything. The reason this works for me is the bed shaker. Even though it doesn't actually ""shake"" the bed the vibrations are enough to jolt me awake in the morning. I think its a good product and it feels sturdy, the display is bright and easy to read but there's no brightness adjustment for it. Also the operation can be a little confusing so I have to double check each night to make sure both the sound and vibration are on. I don't use the lamp outlet but I can see how that would be helpful. It is very loud if turned up all the way, so loud it hurts my ears when jacked up, but that's easily adjustable. I still set clocky and my phone as backups but so far I haven't been late to work since getting this I would definitely recommend it."
5,BUG and STONE Deflector for FJ Cruiser,"This was very easy to install.But doesn't deflect any bugs or stones!!Because the windshield on FJ Cruiser are so straight up and down, they catch every bug for miles around!!SacredGroundz.com"
3,THE STAR WANDERER,"THIS CLASSIC IS STILL AS LIVELY AND ENJOYABLE AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED.-THIS SUPERLATIVE HIT FROM ""THE MUSIC MAN"" PROVIDES UTTER DELIGHT, IT IS CATCHY AND MEMORABLE.-(WHO CAN FORGET THAT DEEP VOICE!)-A SPLENDOUR."
4,Chess Problems,"This is a very large collection, with virtually no explanations or annotations. I was put off by it at first, but now I think it is of value. A large number of one, two, and more move mates are shown. I think there are 600 miniatures from master games and some of his famous daughters' games. Overall an unusual and large collection of material."
4,"Not focused, and error ridden","Yes, Polgar's book is huge, and it does look great on my coffee table. However, its size presents its greatest weakness, and the fact that Polgar had no good computer program in 1993 to double check his solutions is its second weakness.Regarding the size, you will never finish 5000+ problems, and will not learn as much as you would with a more focused approach. I suggest using the more focused software product CT-ART 3.0, which has 1200 problems that you can group by difficulty or by tactical theme, and costs about $25.00.Regarding the errors, well, let's just say I stopped after doing about 400 of the problems, and have marked about ten as having errors. For example, #994 (mate in two) has two viable solutions; the given Qxd4, but Qc3 will also work. #1071 (mate in two) gives Nxf6 as the solution, which indeed will lead to mate next move, but Nc7# is mate in one.Buy it for the looks, but practice tactics with software."
3,Humorous,"This book is one of seven in a series on the seven deadly sins. Originating in a series of lectures, Oxford University Press has published them. This volume consists of Wendy Wasserstein's musings on sloth. Written as a parody of a self-help book, Wasserstein tells us that sloth is the new route to health and happiness. This is a funny book. Wasserstein is a comic talent, and she shows it here. Wasserstein mocks the impulsive culture of diet and self-improvement, but there is a serious side to her critique as well. In her last chapter, Uber-Sloths, Wasserstein dishes out some directed criticism at people who do a whole lot of nothing. The people who race from gym to group to meeting to engagement, enjoying none of it, and all for the sake of being so important as to be busy. This book is a quick read that made me laugh, and also made me nod in agreement."
4,Catchy!,"'Forgive' is the 2nd single from her debut album 'This is Reina', which I highly recommend. Reina (Lori Goldstein) is a true talented singer, and can hit those high notes effortlessly.I enjoyed this maxi-single. The Valentin mixes are the best ones in my opinion, they add a little flavor to the original and make the song more club material. The Giuseppe D. mixes are okay, but the basslines seem to get boring real quick, so I wasn't very impressed. The DezroK mix I didn't care for either, at least vocally. The vocals must have been re-recorded for this track, but they are not nearly as good as the original, somewhat flat on the verses and poor coordination of vocals and production.Reina is just awesome- very strong and controlled voice, and probably the best in the dance music genre (other than Kristine W)...it's a tie between them for me. And outside the studio, she can rip through those hits on stage- saw her live in Orlando and she's got pipes. Support her music!"
1,"Informational, but is it really correct?","I am at a college taking a Geology course on the Age of the dinosaurs. For our assignments we are supposed to watch three movies. I chose this movie seeming like it should be a good informational one.Yet almost all the information they say is incorrect. The T.Rex in the media is a predator, but in reality is just a scavenger. Because of its bone sizes, the T.Rex could not run, at most is that it could walk long distances. The one thing this movie did get correct about the T.Rex is that it has bone-crushing teeth.I wonder if anyone told them."
5,Perfect,I got it in two days using free shipping.I hooked it up with my YAMAHA HTR-6030SL. It works great.I am not sure I should use Toslink or SPDIF miniToslink output for digital output ? (Currently using 3.5mm output.)Can anyone help me please ? Thanks.
5,Very good,"Hi I am from Costa Rica, I have a Power Edge Server. I need to install in it a sound card. The Creative Labs USB SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External Sound Card is the best option. I don't need to open the server.Only I needed to download the driver for XP64 for my Power Edge. It has installed Windows 2003 Server 64 bits. This driver held me to resolved the problem with my sound card. Very good, I am very happy."
2,Not up to its claims,"Not up to its claimsMy sole application for this product (Model S80490) is to convert all my old audio formats into MP3 files. In two locations, the ad copy for this unit claims to do just that but when the box is opened, behold, you must pay an additional license fee to receive that software. I have muddled about and can get there with third party programs but it is messy. The included software is also clunky and dis-coordinated.Hardware-wise, the unit is adequate although the gain available is too low and always maxed out during recordings.For the few who need multi-channel sound from a laptop, maybe it works OK, but for everyone else... get a real, internal sound card for your PC."
1,Very Disappointing!,"Unfortunately, I cannot agree with my fellow readers' rave reviews. ""Marriage in Haste"" started out wonderfully, but it fell apart towards the middle and became almost painful to read at the end. Unfortunately, while the initial plot is very promising (I loved Tess's dare to the other debs), the romance between the characters is sappy and only just this side of believable. Further, the supporting characters are weak. They are poorly developed, shallow copies of the kinds of characters that many romance authors use to enhance their stories. ""Marriage in Haste"" had a lot of promise in the beginning, but was terribly trite in the end. Given the glowing reviews her work generally receives, I may try another Maxwell book in the hope that this was just a poor sample of her work."
3,nice easel,folds almost completely flat very nice easel. Holds books if they are not thicker than an inch in the clip. adjustable angle.
2,Fine for a page or two but not a book holder,"If you want a book holder do not buy this item. It is far too flimsy to hold anything more than a page or two at at time. Even if you manage to get the clip open far enough to hold a book, it will not hold it for long before collapsing."
1,very poor,Colloquial Cambodian......A complete course if you happen to buy the book too. CD pack is usless by itself. Have to buy the book too. A great marketing ploy by Mr Smyth.CD wastes alot of time.... keeps saying... In this lesson 16 we will explore....blah blah.. Then In this next lesson number 17 we shall look at exercise 22 in the book.....( if you happen to have the book). You just hear alot of Khmer words with no English to explain what they are saying. CD has no order. Very poor to try to learn any words....even like Hello or thankyou. If you want to learn Khmer... dont buy this. To waste even more time it even has several interviews (all in Khmer) about how difficult it was to farm under the Lon Nol Goverment...blah blah blah.. More of a History lesson Than a Language program. To understand the interviews you have to be Khmer as there is no English translations. ( or perhaps thats written in a different book that you have to buy aswell.)
5,Useful for me,This book and CD set were my introduction to Khmer. I went through the first 7 chapters before my trip to Cambodia. I was able to say a few things to people with good results.
5,Awesome Combo,I haven't had any issues with my tablet(5 months so far). I am very pleased with the product.
3,It wasn't the right zippo,"The zippo I purchased was described as to have slashes which wasn't the one I received. It was a simple chrome polish all around, no slash design at all. This isn't a complaint to the product itself, the zippo works great, just that it didn't come the way it was described."
3,A close fascimilie,"""Star Struck"" is probably what Nancy Baker Jacobs was after reading a few Sue Grafton novels, because this book seems to be an echo of the Kinsey Millhone series by Grafton. The heroine's parents died when she was very young, as did Millhone's; both live near the California coast; she lives in the guest house of her elderly uncle, while Millhone lives in a converted garage owned by a dear friend, and both have had their homes trashed by the people on whom they were trying to pin a crime. They both have knack for putting their lives in danger while investigating a case....the only main differences between Jacobs' heroine and Grafton's is that one is a reporter and the other is a PI and one has never married, while the other is divorced.As a light mystery, it's ok, but I'd rather read the real deal....any one of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books is better than this one."
3,Mandel's Latest,"This is mostly back-to-the-roots blues but I really only enjoyed one song - ""Shotgun Man""; the guitar solos are truly amazing!"
5,Great book,One of the best books on leadership that I have ever read. Highly recommend to all who want to grow as leaders and learn more.
5,works great,This door stop alarm is very loud and worked on carpet and hard floors. It takes one 9 volt battery. It also stops the door from opening all the way which could buy a little additional time.
1,Battery not included,"be careful when you buy this product! Battery is not included, its useless until you buy the battery. Why can't they just sell a functional product out of the box"
5,Loud! Good quality and inexpensive security/peace of mind.,"This product works as advertised and does make a very loud and annoying high-pitched alarm when triggered. It sounds like a very high-pitched bird making a constant chirping sound with a wavering pitch. My only complaint is that the sound only triggers so long as the pedal is pressed down. So theoretically if someone was trying to sneak into your home or hotel etc., and set it off, they could immediately pull the door back a few inches and the alarm would have only gone off for half of a second or something. It is so loud that I'm sure that it would wake you up, and you would know what it is. But it would be nice if a triggered alarm would sound for at least 5 seconds or something so that neighbors would realize an alarm was going off etc. Overall, especially for the price, this is a great addition to home security."
1,Wouldn't fit five different ordinary average doors in my home,"Take a good, careful look under your doors before buying this product. I tried this door stop alarm on five ordinary, average doors in my house -- two exterior doors, three ordinary interior doors -- and it didn't fit under ANY of the five doors. Unless you have a BIG (>3/4"") gap under your door, this relatively high, thick product isn't going to be able to slide under the door enough to work properly. By the way, my two exterior door were new from Lowes, while the interior doors were old doors from 1949, so the door stops didn't fit a wide variety of doors/frames. No quibbles with product quality -- the door stops seem solid -- but the manufacturer needs to make them with a lot lower profile."
2,Will NOT work under many doors,This product is slightly larger than a normal doorstop. It will work ONLY if the space under the door is large enough for it to slide under. On our trip to India the toe was too thick to fit under the doors at 3 of the 4 hotels we visited. That made it useless 75% of the time. Not a good choice for a travel alarm.
1,Died in its first week and has no grip.,"The alarm on this door stop is great! At least it is for the 3 days that it works! I got up one morning only to notice that it had died in the night, and there was nothing I can do to fix it. I still decided to use it as a door stop in the off chance that someone might enter without warning, but it took my spouse only 2 seconds to push it out of the way with the door. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Didn't work for my home,"I didn't check my doors out before getting the door stop. The gap on the bottom is too thin for this device. It's better for a hotel room. Before you get this, make sure there is at least 1/2 inch gap between the bottom of the door and the floor to slip this device into."
5,Just what I wanted,"This is a wonderful alarm, and exactly what I needed. VERY loud, no problems hearing it, and I have a three level home. Unfortunately my exterior doors open outward so I wasn't able to get it for them, but I do have a door from the basement to the main level and I've placed it there in case I didn't hear someone break into the basement during the middle of the night. I didn't buy this to deter a thief, I bought it to give me the chance to wake up, get the 45 on the nightstand and dial 911. As loud as it is, it will 'definitely' do the job."
5,"Works well, scares the dogs","I bought this for my mom since we've been having lots of thefts around town this summer, but as another reviewer noted, this may not fit under your patio door. It didn't fit under hers, which is the kind that swings inward (doesn't slide). Noise is quite piercing, and I'm glad it has an on-off switch. The one thing I don't care for is the tiny screw that you have to unscrew to insert the battery. When did this become the trend in electronics, having to find the right screwdriver just to insert a battery? It's a pain. I'm keeping it and will probably find a use for it at some point. I'm not worried about thefts because I have 3 dogs, who also make noise that's quite piercing."
5,Works as promised,I was a bit skeptical at first but the Smart Home Door Atop Alarm worked without a hitch. I recommend this product for anyone who stays in hotel / motel rooms or lives alone.
3,A Glorified Door Stop,"Looks good with an accessorized alarm that is truly pointless. Good quality product but if someone is trying to breakdown your door than the door stop itself will do far more good for you, seconds to call 911 or load your gun/rifle than would the alarm sounding. Hearing a door come crashing in is sufficient to alarm you!! What we call in Texas, Kick robberies."
5,squeegees,I bought two so that I always have a spare and keep changing them so they won't wear out as quickly. they work great
1,Reduced Quality disappionting,"I have worn these briefs and Haines for many years. The last 2 Jocky brief purchases (4 3packs) fit and wore well initially.After about 2-3 launderings, the elastic gave out and they no longer stay in place but now slide down when moving.I will not buy these until I read or hear the quality has improved."
2,Yes - Keys to Ascension,"Let me start by saying, that I've been a Yes fan for over 25 years but I have to admit, that I was very disappointed with new Yes DVD. My first impression was - how could such a highly professional band as Yes hire amateurs to film their concert? And I'm not talking about sound and selections, but video! The video is absolutely horrible: angles the band members were shot, annoying and absolutely unnecessary MTV-ish nature clips, video editing. If you plan to own at least 1 Yes DVD it should be either 'House of Yes' or 'Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe. An Evening Of Yes Music Plus' and if you you still want 'Keys to Acsension' go buy double CD and enjoy live concert plus studio recordings not included on any other CDs."
2,Did YES even watch this before allowing the release?,"While this DVD boasts a stellar songlist, the abysmal failure to synchronize the audio and video totally wrecks what could have been a solid effort. What were they thinking when they released this DVD? Did anyone in either Production or the band itself bother to watch this? Why does Alan White hit a snare and then we hear it a second later? This is horrible. For a band that has more raw talent than nearly anything released today, this is a disgrace. I didn't even mind the visual effects. In fact, I liked what they did for Starship Trooper. But how in the world could they put this to market with such an obvious flaw. Anyone with a computer and music software understands how simple it is to fix a minor adjustment like time-sync. Wow. I hope they admit to this error and offer a replacement to any fan that invested in this product."
1,"It's shame, really...",....that someone can so completely screw up an opportunity to record a concert from this classic lineup playing this classic material. I've been a fan of Yes for 30 years and was really intrigued by this DVD when I saw it. I should have read the reviews. Tacky video sequences repeatedly dwarf one of the greatest performing bands in the world. Segments edited into some songs appear to be from completely different pieces. This video is a disaster for anyone actually hoping to see great live footage of the band. Watching it just made me angry.
3,"Good, but could have been better.","As my title suggests, this DVD is pretty good, though it could have been much better.The music as always is absolutely great, I mean it is yes, right? Though the sound mixing isn't all that spectacular, but I guess it does the job.But the hurting point of this DVD is, as everyone else as mentioned, its wacky and sometimes stupid animations."
1,what were they thinking???,"First of all I'm so mad at myself for not buying their House of Blues DVD instead of this crap of DVD. ...Did they get some old burned out light show guy from the Fillmore days to mix the video? I wanted to see the band play, not someone's idea of arty farty image of water,light,double exposure of the band, or any other annoying trite video tricks used back in the 60's.Everytime some exciting music is playing, all I see is Ian or some other band member who's not soloing (this is if they're not showing us some farout image). They should have fired the sound engineer too, I like to hear the drums when I'm listening to live rock concert, thank you very much!!!..."
1,Yes - Keys to Ascension DVD,"DVD is so poorly done the music is great, but the video is awful digital effects are terrible, terrible. Hey guys the one that add all digital effects to the this DVD if you need help to how to record a live concert watch the DVD ""John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and friends live DVD (70th Birthday Concert) ...that's the way you record live video."
2,Bitter--Buy another brand!,"Yes, the single-serve packets are nice. But the coffee does not have that yummy blueberry flavor that I have gotten from other brands. I would not serve this at a party and I would not recommend it to friends.Try another brand."
2,Stopped 3 months after purchase,"This is a gorgeous watch, I love it. I bought if through Amazon from MyTimePiece.com at a great price ($263), BUT around 3 months after I had received it, it just stopped. I called mytimepiece and they told me to go to a local jeweler to have the battery replaced. I did as told, but the jeweler confirmed that the problem was not the battery. I sent it back to mytimepiece and they told me that they would send a replacement. I called about a week later to find out what happened with the shipment and found out that they had ""made a mistake"", because they only cover 30 days after purchase, and had sent it to Bulova. So Bulova is rebuilding my watch (that's what they told me) and I'm still waiting on it... It makes me think if the price reflected somehow the fact that the watch had a problem... I prefer not to trouble myself with that, but it makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
2,Not the color of aquamarine,"I bought this ring in the citrine, for my daughter's birthstone, and in the aquamarine, for my son's birthstone.While the Citrine version was absolutely beautiful and sparkly and beyond my expectations, this aquamarine one was a total disappointment. It looks like blue topaz, a stone I do not like very much. Aquamarine is a lighter, more airy color of blue with bits of green. The stone had absolutely no sparkle at all, very very dull. The same holds true for the matching square stud earrings I ordered. Very dull and not the right color. I will be sending both the ring and the earrings back."
5,Mother's Favorite Poem Book,"My mother is 106 years old. English Literature was her favorate subject in college. She has had a copy of this book for years and gave a copy to each of her 36 grandchildren and great-grandchildren on her 100th birthday. Mother and I read from this book every day and she recites a few of the poems as I read to her. ""A Psalm of Life"" by Longfellow is one of her favorites. I love to give this book as a gift as it ""spreads"" her passion for classic poems."
1,This Album Is Rubbish,"Having heard The Doors' brilliant debut album I rushed out to buy this one eagerly.I was filled with disgust, however, when I put the album on. When The Music's Over is basically the tune to Soul Kitchen. The only feeling this album gave me was one of sorrow when I realized that I had shelled out good money for this piece of crap. The Doors have discarded their distant, icy sound which was featured throughout the Debut. Morrison's lyrics are mediocre and a distant memory from his brilliance on the first album. Jim Morrison did'nt die in 1971, he died when this album came out.For an album titled Strange Days it is surprisingly normal."
4,Anti-aging,"This quickly succeeded sophomore release is possibly the closest Morrison and crew ever came again to putting out a disc as solid as their legendary self-titled, and although it does have a few less then perfect entries and perhaps tries to mimic the original formula, most of the songwriting and effortless, innovative band interaction still astonishes with an assured vision never really captured quite the same again in rock."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"Okay, it was cheap, but I was disappointed with this reconditioned unit. The description didn't say anything about damage, and mine came with 2 deep scratches across the glass door and lots of smaller scratches on the sides. Not really suitable for display on the kitchen counter like it is intended.As far as operation, I had to put it in the basement because it couldn't keep white wines cool enough to drink in my kitchen. In my unfinished basement, it chills to about 50 degrees, which is about right for me. Not very convenient!I'm not sure if I am going to bother to keep using it."
5,Great album,Great album - this was a replacement for an old worn out one. Would recommend any Doors album to anyone - am a big fan.
5,"Excellent pharmacology book, but time commitment necessary","This book was extremely useful for me to study for the boards. It is detailed, yet very clear, with good explanations and tables. It emphasizes on drug use, interactions and adverse effects. Each chapter includes a series of 15-20 relevant questions, and you will find at the end a summary of all key drugs in a few words (very useful for a final review just before the exam). The book also includes 2 board-type examinations of 120 questions each.However, it requires a time commitment of several weeks to be really useful. Therefore, I will strongly recommend it to study during your school classes and then for review, or for international medical students or graduates who,like me, studied pharmacology years ago and need to review everything."
3,"comme ci, comme ca","I was disappointed with the set, as if they were trying to save money. The Halle of Song was supposed to be a bright, elegant rich affair but the setting was the same.Music was good, but I'll still be looking for another version."
1,I Feel As If I've Been Cheated.,"There's only one real issue in this performance for me, and that's Renee Kollo's disastrous attempt to be Tannhauser at the age of 57.Kollo IS too old, LOOKS too old, and his singing has an atrocious WOBBLE as he tries to hold the notes throughout. He does not star in this production, he ruins it. CAVEAT EMPTOR! Beware of this DVD at all costs. Although Waltraud Meier is wonderful, almost wonderful enough to buy this DVD for - almost - I can never watch this DVD again after the first time because Kollo is so bad and so ever-present. Hardly worth a single star.I feel like I've been cheated."
3,Not Bad,"Compared to that disastrous ""Tristan und Isolde"" this DVD is somewhat more acceptable, even though stage looks like designed by second-class graphic designer and acting is often silly.The best thing in this production is obviously Waltraud Meier's Venus.She is beautiful and so convincing as a goddess of carnal pleasure."
4,"Music- great, Production - odd","The music is wonderful. Singers range from exceptional, Meier and Weikl, to very good, Kollo and Secunde. That part of the opera is fine. The production suffers from an acute outbreak of obscure meaningful symbolism. There is a guy in a wolf suit, a woman dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, a [body part] here and there, lots of film noir camerawork with big shadows, and some things that look left over from Evita.The visual impact is powerful, but to what end? Meier's Venus is worth the purchase of the DVD."
5,A Bobblehead of Me by Mike Piazza,Hey I'm on a bobblehead as I am the great former New York Mets hero. And I am recently one of the more popular players on my team.But my teammate and coach William Vogt is going to throw away my music.Mike Piazza of Seattle Mariners
5,Secret Gardens of the Heart,"I've read some of the reviews on this album and the two songs most recognized and loved are Secret Gardens and Hollyann and I must concur. I have some of Judy's vinyls from yesteryear;), but I don't have this particular one. I bought the CD just for those two songs because they are so endearing and simply beautiful. The other songs are good, but don't hold that kind of wistful feeling I get when I hear Secret Gardens and Hollyann.A good album, but I'm pining for the not yet made CD of Judy's So Early in the Spring the First Fifteen years where all the songs are just amazing and the ones most fans would enjoy are on this album. Now that would be a definite keeper."
3,obscure book but a great read,"Ol' Fred really got around!His story covers his around-the-world-on-a-bike journey - in 1935!The real interest to me is a description of the pre-WWII world. He describes some of the situation in Germany as things get dark. He visits Palestine and Egypt with comments about his own experience and reactions. He heads across Iran and Afghanistan, down through India and a harrowing voyage through Burma. It is quite a ride!"
1,Poor packing,"I really wanted to try this. The first one I received had the black plastic collar broken where an exhaust connection would go. Returned it and got a second one with the same breakage. I wanted to order another one and try again, but Amazon.com, knowing what's best for me decided not to ship me another one, but instead give me a refund. Did I mention I really wanted to try this? Thanks Amazon for knowing what I want better than I."
1,False Doctrine!,"Do NOT buy this book! It is False Doctrine! It claims that people get cancer because they don't have enough faith in God. This is a lie from Satan. God come to give life and give it more abundantly. Satan as well as cancer, comes to steal, kill and destroy! Cancer is from Satan and it's not from a lack of faith!"
4,Eye spy.......MAGIC .,This is a very imaginitive book which makes it slightly confusing . I liked this book and it showed a different side to valarie . When one of Sabrinas spells does not get reversed after all-you-can-cast-day she has to try to hide the spell becouse a scientist is trying to find and prove that magic exists . This is not easy for Sabrina becouse this guy is hanging around her aunt Zelda!!!
4,I Spy...,"This Book is about Sabrina's first Castanalia which is an all-can-cast-day when she can cast any spell she wishes for that one day that does not actually exist. By midnight all the spells she casted will be undone, what she doesn't know is that one of her spells survived the night, but which one? And how is she going to reverse it without the letting the spying witch hunters knows her secret?"
5,A brilliant album from a great band,"The doors self titled debut is absolutely one of the best rock music albums in my collection.It contains classics like BREAK ON THROUGH,THE END and THE CRYSTAL SHIP.very highly recommended."
3,They did get much higher...,"This is a good album, but I disagree with reviewers who claim this is The Doors' best.It certainly doesn't compete with ""The Soft Parade"" and ""Waiting For The Sun""."
1,I'm angry I bought this,"I'm a huge Doors fan. I lost the original CD I bought. It was the original mix and sounded great. Now they remixed it!!! In the song Break on Through, Jim doesn't sing just ""She gets, she gets, she gets........high"". Now they inserted the ""high"" for each ""she gets"". This is artistically wrong. The current crew who remixed this did not see that. Are they crazy!!! Leave good enough alone, please!!!"
2,Jim Morrison's pretentions would bog down any album,"The Doors made a beautiful noise, but Jim Morrison was perhaps the most pretentious person ever to have lived, and his presence ruins the proceedings. He has been made into a god by the faceless rock followers who worship his preening and semi-mythological, pedestrian psychological constructs, but in fact he was an almost talentless lyricist and a very limited vocalist to say the least. Take this band right out of the so-called ""Rock n Roll Pantheon,"" and put them straight into the gutter where they belong. A sort of sixties Duran Duran."
1,Rotten,"I once knew a man who was the biggest Doors fan in the world. He knew more about Jim Morrison than his own dad. But one day, I played him The White Album(The Beatles). Immediately after, he said, ""Why was I wasting my time listening to the Doors"" He has been a Beatles fanatic for the last 15 years!!!"
2,For Tati fans only,Not a huge fan of Jacques Tati. His antics are annoyingly cute. This was one of his first efforts and he does get better over time.
1,Poor Product,"I'm surprised at the good reviews above... maybe I'm having a bad day but I found this ridiculous. It was missing screws (which I had around the house) but the brace holes did not exactly line up with the slider attached to the very plastic tray. It's an incredibly cheap drawer, of course, it doesn't cost much either. I would spend more money and get a better quality unit... and hopefully, with better quality control so they actually include all the necessary screws, etc. The single-page ""Instructions"" is of little help with no orientation of the pieces you have to attach.Also, getting tired of having to do 100% of the assembly anymore. Much of this could have been done at the factory and it would have fit into the same size box or ever so slightly larger box. Personally, I'm not ordering stuff like this anymore... too cheap, too poor quality control, too much assembly. Always made in China."
4,Very solid with some mods,This thing is fairly heavy and sturdy with zero play with the lock tightened. The bag comes packed hard as a rock and didn't have any give to it. First I emptied some out and tried it but I ended up tossing it all and filling it with crushed walnut shells. It came filled with ground plastic that didn't conform to the stock very well. Also- to keep the bag from moving on the base put some rubber shelf liner or double stick tape between them.
5,For grown-ups AND kids!,"This is a favorite when looking for an energy pop ... sort of caffeine on CD. And during a week-long painting project with a 13-year old, all hip hop and rap, this was the single CD he asked for again and again!"
5,Really good!,I toss this on most chicken items I make from whole chickens to wings.Just to spice up things I put a little in prior to grilling and still keep whatever sauce I want.
3,"Good, but read it first and plan around it.","We got this book before we went to D.C., but did not have time to complete the activities in it until we were on the road home. Turns out, we saw a bunch of stuff that wasn't in there and missed at least half of the sights in the book (not that we regret it). It was crowded and crazy in the Museum of Natural History, so we didn't have the time to linger and notice all the things that they asked about, so even that part kind of missed the mark. It would have been better if I'd had my 9 year old preview the questions before we went out every day. It's a good way to get upper elementary to junior high kids to go a little further into what they see, instead of just getting impatient about when's the next snack. Too bad we didn't use it that way..."
4,Marty's Review,This book is a very heart warming series. It was well written and held my interest throughout all three books. I am looking foward to reading about more characters in the next books in the series.
3,Good information....,Loaded with lots of helpful information. The biggest turnoff for me was her 'overuse' of the 'evolution' idea. That is hogwash! Golden Retrievers (as everything on this Earth) were CREATED by God! UGH! Other than her twisted beliefs and ignorance on creation...it's a helpful book!
4,Good CD,"The next line in the Fall out boy Cd's. This is a really good cd with great songs like Dance, Dance and this latest release A little less sixteen candles, a little more touch. With their Cd though they could have work on some songs but overall the I give it a 4 for a good preformance."
2,Ok but not mindblowing,"This CD is ok. I can't remember the last time I absolutely NEEDED to hear it. I didn't get hooked. A few tracks are cool, but I only really listen to it if I have nothing else to do."
4,a good album,"This isn't normally the kind of music that I listen to, and I only heard of Fall Out Boy recently but I really like this album. It's one of the few album where I like all of the songs, the songs are fun and you won't get tired of listening to them over and over again. My favorite songs on this album are: sophmore slump or comeback of the year, of all the gin joints in the world, and a little less sixteen candles, a little more touch me."
2,EHHHHH??,"EHHHHH. thats what it is. EHHHH. Sometimes i can stand them, most of the time i cant. Mostly because their only somewhat decent songs have the [...]overplayed out of them on the radio. If i hear Sugar We're Going Down or Dance Dance again i'm gonna throw my radio out the window. This album works better for elevator music than it does the main music of parties. Just once, just once would i like to see a band the likes of Glass Casket/Between The Buried and Me or the immortal Killswitch Engage played at a party. That'll be the day. Unearth would work well too.....or August Burns Red....You get the idea. Bottom Line: EHHHHHH, as i said above."
2,Not my type of music,"Ok first of all i like 70's and 80's metal. Thats not why i gave this album 2 stars. I just didnt like the music on it. I have to admit it has some catchy songs. I just think they are annoying after the first few times you have heard them. Plz dont get mad at me becuase im a metal fan, I do respec FOB. I don't think people should judge people becasue of the music they listen to. I mean come on there are other issues in the world besides someone liking music that is being shoved down our throats. GO MAIDEN, SABBATH, PRIEST, METALICA, and MEGADETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I hate you ""I Love Fall Out Boy""!","This chick named ""I Love Fall Out Boy"" is such an idiot! She bashes great bands like Megadeth, Slayer, and Alice in Chains and respects crap like Fall Out Boy and The Black Eyed Peas! You suck okay! You're a girlie who loves all this emo crap and is glued to MTV! This is not a good album! If I hear ""Sugar We're Going Done"" one more time I'll destroy my radio, punch my brain, and run outside screaming ""WHY GOD WHY?!"" Your boyfriend is so much smarter than you. Megadeth, Slayer, and Alice in Chains rock the tights off Fall Out Boy, The Black Eyed Peas, and Gwen Stefani. Go sulk with this album a while while me and my metal buddies listen to Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?"
1,in response to joel crawford,"I admit right off the bat that I am a novice in terms of Fall Out Boy, but the statement that they have some of the best lyrics off the past few years is 1. of no consequence in a musical era almost entirely lacking decent songwriters 2. Is incorrect, I have read sheets of their lyrics and they are mediocre (bull****, whiny) emo lyrics AT BESTSorry if this seems like a personal afront, it nothing of the sort, but I have taken on the role of righting wrongs wherever!!! I see them and feel my opinion is just as valid as yours (hence me expressing it)"
1,Titles are funny but,The titles are funny but the only thing good about Fall Out Boy. It sounds like any other band in Emo Pop Punk or whatever people call it. Not speical and really annoying after a few listens.
3,Okay for new music.,"I bought this album based on my liking of SWGD. It's okay, I like SWGD and Dance Dance, the rest, eh, okay."
1,from under the cock tree,I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think fall out boy is a wannabe. I think he needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to tie dildos to a tree. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough
4,Give FOB a listen :),"... Im not a big Punk/emo fan , but i do enjoy FOB music (their song titles alone are Interesting)This album isn't TTTYG but just as good imo . As a guy who listen's to just about all types of music I say Get the album .fob!"
2,gets annoying real quick,"well I got this a while ago, and at first, well it wasn't bad, it was catchy and a few songs stuck in my head, but I had been listening to it while I was out and busy, so when I actually sat down and listened to it and the lyrics, well I realized that it's quite awful! the lyrics don't mean anything! the music in the background is completely unoriginal...I mean they certainly didn't go out of their way to create this album.and also, what the hell is the difference between fall out boy and panic at the disco? this isn't real music. real music comes from the soul, it's like dna, no one has the same dna. well I guess there's cloning.."
4,....,"ok to start this off.... im not the biggest fan of fall out boy. But, you people who have the time to sit in front of the computer and flame about how much they hate FOB have a problem. When will this sink in with you guys? Punk, is NOT THE SAME AS CLASSIC ROCK!!!!!!!! Its almost retarted to compare Fall Out Boy to the Beatles! And just so you guys know, FOB isn't emo. Also, they aren't the same as Good Charlote and other crap punk bands! So get off your lazy butts, get out of your house, and accept this...... MUSIC CHANGES! Pretty soon im expecting to hear this from one of you. ""They played classical music in the 1700's.... WE SHOULD ALL LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC!! ALL ROCK BANDS SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"" etc. etc. etc. So overall, just open your ears just a little bit and stop wasting your time flaming about every little thing you whiny babys hate"
4,Great new band,hat can I say I love this band. I was really surprised. i usually don't like the rock kind of music. But this music kind of grasps u into their nerdy/geeky/yet lovable album.If you like rock or just something hip and new. Definitely buy this album. if u don't like it at first i guarantee it will grow on you!!
4,MTV takes another band down the drain,"OK if the first time you ever heard of this band was on MTV when ""Sugar we're going down"" was on TRL or when you heard Dance, Dance on Madden 06 then you suck. MTV ruins bands everyday when they show music to crappy teenagers who think they know what good music is. MTV should go off the air.Now on to the album....its a good album with some catchy tunes on it. I still don't like it quite as much as Take This To Your Grave but it is a decent album. The best song on the album is actually the bonus track from the Japan import, ""The music or the misery."" You teenie boppers ever heard that song? Of course not the only song you know the words to is ""sugar...."". I can't wait to knock some of you little 15 year olds around at the concert. You guys should stick to Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys."
5,my Fall Out Boy obsession is growing...,"This album is completely different from their mainstream debut, Take This To Your Grave, but when each album is taken as it is, they are both amazing. My initial reaction was that this album is much more poppy. However, it would be completely wrong to place it into the typical ""pop-punk"" genre... it is much more thought-provoking than that, and deserves a lot more credit. I think this album will open up FOB to a larger audience. If you consider yourself hardcore, this definitely isn't for you. But if you're a true FOB fan, you'll appreciate this as much as I do."
1,Extreamly Disappointed..........,"First off, Im not some MTV ""hardcore"" kid, so dont just blow me off because of the kid title, because Im not.I loved TTTYG, the lyrics were great, liked the music, blah, blah, blah. So naturally I picked up this album.I listened to it once or twice and have never had a desire to listen again. Believe me, its not a good sign when you cant tell one song from another. In my opinion, all the songs were alike and unoriginal. I expected much more after TTTYG. I wish I had never bought it, wasted twelve dollars."
4,"Fun music, good sense of humor, I'm thinking...next new wave?","Since these guys don't sound much at all like much else on the radio, with the exception of a couple of other bands, I'm happy to throw out the ""new wave"" moniker (while not hailing from any other shore). These guys have some great energy, their writing is amusing (think Barenaked Ladies early stuff), but they really should mix up the tempo/beat/tone a little. Most of their songs sound the same. Work on that, I'll hook em up with five stars next time."
4,Above and beyond!,"This was the first Fall Out Boy album I ever picked up, so perhaps I'm a bit biased. But it was very catchy, the lyrics were pure genius (got stuck in my head for days and even put out as away messages and headlines on MySpace, Facebook, AIM, and MSN). I was only in middle school when I discovered them, so I may be a bit biased.Four stars, because although the album is good, Pete's voice is quite nasaly and confusing in a good number of the songs. Also, very complicated song titles... some even rivaling Panic At the Disco.Anyway, it's very good for teenagers, but I don't recommend it to people out of that category. They just won't understand it."
2,it realy bad but some is okay,this cd is good in about 3 songs but then it justs dies and goes to hell.
1,This CD sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is horrible pop music for people with no musical taste. It is horrible. Do not buy it at all costs. This band is so annoying. It is overrated. It is music for tenny bopper thirteen year old girls.
1,Music that causes brain cancer,"Ahh yes, the band I hate more than Hitler himself. Hell, if I had to choose between sharing a room with Adolf or the members of Fall Out Boy, I would share a room with der Fuhrer. They claim to be influenced by Iron Maiden and Green Day, but the only influence I can hear is the lead singers sister and N Sync. While the 90s had boy bands like 98 Degrees and the Backstreet Boys, we now have such pathetic groups as Fall Out Boy and Hawthorne Heights.While emo music is the current norm, I'm only glad that, like all fads, this band will be forgotten, and all the members will go back to doing what they were born to do, being gay pornstars."
3,A Decent Album,"This is an okay album, it's got a few good songs. But this is better for downloading individual songs, instead of buying the whole album.Fav songs:""Sugar, We're Going Down""""A Little Less Sixteen Candles...""""Of All The Gin Joints..."""
2,Not My Bowl Of Soup,"Im just not that impressed with these guys.They have some good songs; ""Our Lawyer Made Us Change"" and ""Dance Dance"" are the best this disc has to offer.While ""All The Gin Joints In The World"" and ""Sophmore Slump Or Comeback"" are decent as well.However there just isnt much depth to this genre of music,so it is hard to stay interested for long.I do enjoy some Emo/Pop Rock such as Jimmy Eat World,Brand New(Deja Entendu only),and Ok Go,but these guys just dont really do it for me."
3,It's what you'd expect,"Ok, first of all, it's a catchy record. With that being said, Take this to your grave was much better and just stronger as a whole. I've been reading some of the reviews, and for the most part they're truthful, but when you kids start throwing out terms like ""lyrical genius"" in reference to fall out boy, something is wrong. If you're looking for well written lyrics in this genre, check out the TREOS album.In conclusion.Download some choice songs off this CD, save your money."
5,Great printer cartridge,"No surprises. Got exactly what I was looking for, only much less expensive than what I would have paid at a retail store."
4,Mingus and trains. Huh?,"If you are looking for a terrific example of Mingus' music, do not buy this. However, if you are interested in watching a good 'art' film set to good music, then check this out. I would recommend this video to music and film lovers, however you must have an open mind. The use of Mingus' music is very delicate, yet effective. It is slow to start, so do not discount it in the first 5 minutes. A worthy buy, but not essential for Mingus fans."
3,great product,great product love them. fits me and i am very plus size women. very easy to put on and take off. only bad thing is they can ripe or get runs in them very easily. very stretch material nice lacey top of leggins and belt is very comfortable almost like there not even there. get picture of them too.
2,Good if you're a size 2,"The quality of this product is good, the shipping was fast. My problem was they run small..... I'm or a big girl and the garder was tight"
5,Just Right!,This is a well designed product that accurately and steadily enables you to position your router. It's a big step up from having to work under the table or remove the router for every adjustment. The lower price point is appreciated by this cost conscious woodworker too.
4,Almost perfect,Works great. The only complaint I have is that the height adjustment will wander due to the vibration of the router. The only way to get a consistent height is to put some masking tape over the ring around the height adjusting mechanism to keep it from wandering. Then it works great.
4,another good nicholson film,"this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an 18-year old,for a petty theft,to prison.one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his 8-year sentence.the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the 2 show him what he's missed all within a 5-day period.jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance,while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances.other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days,in a brief apperance.this is a very good film but i wouldn't say it were great,for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again.it definitely is worth seeing though,at least for nicholson fans."
1,"Unauthorized, illegal release","Don't waste your money on this unauthorized, illegal release of this film. Gamera, Super Monster will be coming out soon from Shout! Factory with excellent presentation, fully authorized by Kadokawa Pictures. Don't buy this bootleg junk!"
2,not well made,"This is a mechanical (not optical) trackball, and they made a critical design error: the rollers are metal, not rubber. This means that if there's any stickiness to the rollers at all -- say, if dirt or hair or pet fur gets in them -- the ball slips over the rollers and it ceases to function. And the rollers aren't easily accessible so they're nearly impossible to clean.The trackball is nice and big, which makes for good control (great for gaming or detail graphic work) but after a month or so of use it simply stops functioning well. It just isn't worth the price."
5,The absolute best,"This is the best gospel cd, in my opinion, to date. Pure, raw singing. They don't make them like this anymore."
5,Great piece of equipment!,"My only complaint was that I had to search around online for drivers. It would have been nice if you had included the CD. Other than that, I am MORE than satisfied!"
4,"Relaxing, beach alike & confortable sounds","Excelent sounds of an excelent artist as is JJohnson. If you like JJ, definitive you will like this one."
2,"""Bait & switch""?","We saw previews of this on a DVD for another movie. It looked like it was going to be hilariously amusing. As is sometimes the case with previews/trailers for movies, it was one of those where the PREVIEWS pretty-much show you ALL THE BEST PARTS and the REST of it is ""FILLER"". The acting was good, but the plot----if there was one----was obscure, uninteresting, & sort of ""all-over-the-place"". We have really liked some of director Danny Boyle's flicks, like ""Millions"" for example, but this wasn't one of them. We were sorry we wasted our time & money. I would not recommend it."
4,Familiar to everyone,"I agree this is not as good as There and Then. But only because of the songs. This tour was in support of the 'standing on the shoulder of giants' album which is my least favourite in the entire Oasis catalogue. But as far as sound and visuals go, I reckon this is a lot better. You actually feel like you are a part of the event that took place on the night of the 21st of july 2000. Hard to believe it was that long ago. I have seen Oasis live a few times and they are excellent live, so if you have never seen them in concert and would like too I highly recommend this as a substitute for now.The special features are outstanding and the accompanying interviews Liam and Noel actually make sense for a change, instead of their incoherent rambling from the past.The versions of 'stand by me' and 'don't look back in anger' are my standout tracks here. I look forward to the next live DVD release from Oasis."
2,Disappointing arrangement,"I enjoy Oasis but I was disappointed by the arrangement of this DVD. The crowd noise drowns out many of the vocals. If you've always wanted to hear the crowd sing along with Oasis then buy this, if not then save you money for the CD's."
3,"Not bad, but we've seen better","Noel just kinda looks tired in this show, and all the stage antics don't add up to much. Guess I liked ""Then and There"" since they were really in their prime, and perhaps since it was shot at night instead of day, it kinda looks better... Plus, the playlist on the ""Familiar"" DVD is sorta short... But the extras are pretty cool, and when you switch between menus, you get to see a clip of Noel or Liam using profanity like they do so well!"
5,Songs of the cat,This is a slightly goofy compilation pairing Garrison Keillor's voice with opera star Flicka von Stade. Very funny.
4,Family Secret...,"THE UNSEEN has a lot going for it. Sydney Lassick (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, CARRIE) is perfectly maniacal as the main baddie. Barbara Bach does a serviceable job in her TV news reporter role. The story, while simple, is nonetheless adequate, and the suspense builds nicely. Obviously, the mystery of who (what?) THE UNSEEN is makes up most of this tale. Many have spilled the beans already, so I'll just add that Stephen Furst (ANIMAL HOUSE) is quite good as the title character. What this movie lacks in bloody mayhem, it more than makes up for in the insanity department! The motivations of the ""family"" are very dark indeed. This ain't THE WALTONS or THE CLEAVERS! Check out this wacky, 80s head-cheeeze today..."
1,like we need this,"swear when an artist dies the label pimps them to death if big would have spent extra time in the studio I swear we would have gotten more releases. anyway we heard these sonmgs to death you really like big download this nasty girl features nelly, and fagged edge puff and nelly could have did that by themselves did they have to put big on there but hey anything for money."
5,buy it,I'm not a devoted van morrison fan. This is Van Morrison being a country music star. I love it. It's pure country and pure van morrison. Sounds impossible but it really really works.
4,"Can we have a Gospel album next, please?","Beware of playing this album too much, as the tunes are incredibly catchy and you'll find yourself singing them repetitively for days. I wish there had been a few more slow, achey-breaky type songs, such as the last one, and slightly less of the upbeat ones, but it's a fun album, as it is.It's been said of Van that his voice is so extraordinary he could sing the phone book and it'd still sound like a classic. Really true, because some of these songs are kind of dumb, but when he does them, they're somehow redeemed.Now, if we could just have an album of straight gospel songs (including his incredible version of ""Just A Closer Walk With Thee"") I can die a happy Van fan."
2,Nature love portrayed in stilted language,"One of the first children's picture books to portray a child learning to love nature through encountering salmon, this 1973 effort features semi-stylized pen and ink illustrations that stop just this side of cuteness. The language uses formal speech patterns in what looks like an attempt to portray Native Americans with due respect. No source is given for the allegedly traditional tale of how the salmon started coming upstream in response to the tears of mothers crying for their starving children. Since its publication, many others have done a better job."
4,Should have been better!,"Her textbook Diagnostic Neuroradiology had made quite an impact when it came out. The only comparable book was that by Ruth Ramsey previously. Since that textbook had been the reference for everybody, a new edition was expected by everybody. This new format comes as a surprise. While it is certainly more exhaustive in scope than her previous book (taht was a bit skimpy on the spine IMHO), the format used does not do too well with me. I have personally never really liked these list-type textbooks. This is of course a good reference for anyone who wants to look up something during daily routine (even if each reference section is somewhat too short) but it cannot really be used to learn the basics of neuroradiology that one neeeds for training. The sometimes lengthy discussions in the book by Taveras are needed in order to approach Neuroradiology as an art. while you probably have to buy this for reference you must also get another textbook."
1,Poor customer service,"I found that Patriot customer service was the worst.They say ""call us we can help"" it's printed right on their packaging but I was never even able to get a response and the card didn't work in my electronic device.Thanks for nothing Patriot."
1,Don't like this style.,I got this to try out this style bellyring and I didn't like it at all. This looks very cheap.
5,Kensington 62195 Simply Portable One Notebook Carrying Case,"Kensington 62195 Simply Portable One Notebook Carrying CaseI really like this well padded case. Heavy duty, has storage compartments to get organized, lots of room for accessories, rugged, self-repairing, industrial-strength size eight zippers & wide shoulder straps. This item will last a lifetime!"
3,Elegant Look But....,"This notebook carrier designed to supply high protection for laptops during transport and presents many details for carrying related stuff. Elegant look but, weak handle. It is torn off after a week i used it to carry my 4 lbs laptop."
4,Very Good Debut,"This is a very good debut from my fellow Massachusetts-onian Jonathon Edwards. I particularly like the up-tempe numbers like ""Train to Glory"" and ""Everybody Knows Her"", although the ballads are just as good. ""Sunshine"" is probably the most popular track on the album, as it was his biggest hit I believe. It is a quick two-minute masterpiece with a beautiful melody. I recommend this album to anyone who is fans of artists such as Jackson Browne, Pure Prarie League, and Joni Mitchell."
5,wow,"It is rare that you run across a song as awesome as ""Sometimes"" --- This album is among my all-time favorites... YOU NEED TO BUY THIS... if you like James Taylor-esque type music...You will not be disappointed... If you are, I will personally refund your money... that is a promise.."
3,The reader from Idaho...,...is infuriating until it becomes clear that he/she is being ironic. It seems 18 people either realize that or agree with some deliberately outrageous beliefs.
4,BenisE:The Spanish Guitar,"I love the guitar music and Bernise performance is axcellent. We, mi and my wife will listerng the music again and again.Bb."
3,Not impressed,I picked up this magazine in the checkout line based on the article titles. I was really disappointed. The articles were not particularly insightful & some of them were just fluff. It was just an average blah magazine. I won't buy it again.
3,Okay quality,"I don't fully agree with the other two reviewers. They say how the lock turns and it hides the code line on the table. What about flipping the lock around before you lock it? However, despite the other's not-so-true design problems, I agree that it is a little weak. The cable is very strong, but the lock portion that connects to the computer isn't. I know the slot is small, but why so small that it makes it weak. The point of the lock is to be strong and prevent breakage. I wouldn't say any of the locks are that strong, and this one isn't an exception."
1,"bad, bad..","Somehow, the combo got changed on mine, making for an interesting afternoon with a wire-cutters and then a locksmith.. Thankfully, Kensington paid me back, after saying that this problem came up a decent amount with this model... no good.."
1,Poor design,"Very difficult to lock and unlock--I have to hold my MacBook Pro on edge to get a grip on the lock while I spin the wheels. Also the mechanism used to set new combinations is a lever that flips very easily. In locking or unlocking the lock, it is all too easy to inadvertently set a new combination.I have no gripes with the security the device provides, but it is basically unusable. Very frustrating."
4,Enchanting,"This book was very interesting, enjoyable and funny! If you're looking for a quickly moving, interesting and funny fantasy novel full of quirky characters, you should definitely read this book. I loved the character of Oliver, who is a cat turned into a human. I have never read a book with a such a fascinating character like him before. The only part I didn't like so much was the part when the elves or ""Fair folk"" come in. They're a little too...far out and weird. But other than that, a great read!"
4,One of the best Scoob DVDs out there,"I grew up watching Scooby and now my 5-year old is doing the same. What a trip it is to sit and watch these with him. Most are so much more ridiculous than I remember as a kid, but this collection is great! Some unusual episodes with subtle humor (especially the Toy one!). Lots of enjoyment here. However, we got ours at Target for $14.99."
3,"Give ""Live"" a Rest!!","In and of itself, this album obviously stands as one of 98's top releases. Still, it seems that the 'awwww... it's not as good as Live Through This' thing will daunt it until it (has it already?) dies. Give it a rest, folks. Agreed with an earlier review that all of the 'gone pop' accusations are ridiculous since Live Through This was little more than loud pop, too. Fans who dug the singles from that album but felt that the noisier moments were simply dumb and forced will appreciate the growth seen on this release. A bit forced and saccharine at moments, but gut-wrenching gems like 'Petals' and 'Use Once and Destroy' wash the sugar down with some delicious grit. Recommended."
3,Album does not live up to its promising beginning.,"""Live Through This"" was the most compelling album in years. On this follow-up, the band does a good job of polishing and commercializing their sound while still leaving enough frayed edges to avoid alienating their fans. The guitar sound is vanilla frosting -- thick and sweet. Courtney has improved her voice, and the songs sound like the Go-Gos with big guitar and attitude. Unfortunately, the material does not live up to the sound. The songwriting lacks the focus of ""Live Through This."" The exception is the title track, which, like the rest of the album, is an ambivalent love letter to L.A. The difference is that, on this song, Hole seems to have the courage of its convictions."
3,Somewhere between a ripped babydoll and a Versace gown,"As mentioned previously, this album is nowhere near the level of Live Through This. Kurt's music (ahem) and Courtney's lyrics and delivery made LTT an astonishing and unique creation. Celebrity Skin is an often catchy but sometimes bland pop record that, yes, sounds like the Bangles, Smashing Pumpkins (no surprise there) and the ""old"" Hole all rolled into one radio friendly, guitar riffed, tamborine shaking, ""LA girl"" pop confection. The biggest disappointment, in my mind, is Courtney's singing; she's flattened her voice out like a pancake. This is a worthy album, but it leaves one wondering if Hole's next effort will actually produce a Rick D's top 40 hit."
1,I would have given it -1000 stars if I was able to,"I'm surprised this junk even left the mixing and mastering rooms. Courtney Love was never a diva, but now she's trying to be - what possessed her to do that? I've heard the disc and almost all of it reminds me of Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. I was thinking it would have sounded more like the album's title track, but reality slapped me in the face...this music is strictly for the soft rock stations. This is the first Hole album I've purchased and it will also be the last...this is so horrible that I'm taking it right back to the record store for a refund. To make a long story short, unless you like Celine Dion I would strongly advise you not to waste your money on this CD."
5,Album of the Year,"By now, most punk is either a retread of 1976 (conservative and reactionary), or has become popped-up, while claiming to be ""Alternative"". The rock / pop on ""Celebrity Skin"" is accessible, commercial, and polished ... all those things that are supposed to be unforgivable sins in the ossified, dogmatic world of late '90's ""underground"". Hole doesn't sound punk anymore, and they aren't pretending to be. They are, however, clearly writing, playing, and singing from their hearts and having a good time at last. God bless 'em, they deserve it. And I, for one, will not begrudge them any success they find. Selling out never sounded so good!"
4,Solid from start to finish!!!,"I was impressed with this CD. It has been a long time since I actually listened to a CD all the way through in one sitting. Normally I've had enough after about 4 songs, but this was like a good book, I could not hit the stop button. I'll be waiting for the sequel to this. Get louder Hole!!!!"
5,Best CD of the year,"Although different from the harder edged ""Live Through This"", Celebrity Skin successfully combines rock and grunge. I cannot stop listening, this is the one tape that does not leave my person. Every song is memorable, with Celebrity Skin, Malibu and Reason to Be Beautiful leading the pack. Courtney, we love you!"
4,Great Album!,"I think this album is really great! It is a complete change from Pretty on the Inside, but it still rocks. Just my oppinion...anyway. I thought it has some great songs. (Northern Star is my favorite!)"
5,Hole Lotta Love!,"In my mind Live Through This and Radiohead's OK Computer are the best cds of the decade. Celebrity Skin gives both a run for the money. Cool, deep, fun, hard, reflective. The lyrics are far and away stronger than Live Through This; the music is a real detour like the GoGos on acid. AND THAT IS A COMPLIMENT... To my mind the best tracks are Celebrity Skin, Reasons To Be Beautiful, and Boys On The Radio. A definite buy."
5,Great,Courtney brings attitude and punk mixed with pop and rock all in one it's a great cd i bought it and my sister sratched it up with a pen but i'm gonna buy it again and this time i'll sratch up her.
3,It took a while,"I bought this album and then forgot about it for quite a long time. Then after loading everything I owned to my iPod I rediscovered Hole. I think that there are quite a few really good tracks on this album and some that really shouldn't have made it. On the good list are: Celebrity Skin, Dying, Playing Your Song and Petals. On the bad list are Awful and Hit So Hard. The rest of the tracks are listenable but not spectacular.It is worth owning, but it is not fantastic"
3,Lacks the punch of last album,"Hole's latest offering lacks the punch, edge, and sheer inspiration of Live Through This. The music is average at best, the lyrics shallow, and the guitar work is pedestrian."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"The title song caught my attention before I bought it. I was expecting more of the same but ended up with a bunch of corny songs with cheesy lyrics. I can't believe that this is the best they could come up with after the amazing ""Live Through This."" It just makes me wonder how much Kurt Cobain had to do with the last album."
2,dont waste your money.........,"ok listen here, ive had enough of this grungy kind of music, the only song even worth listening to is ""celebrity skin"". the rest are just a bunch of grungy scrap metal. if i didnt feel so sorry for this cd theni would put one star but just to be a little nice i put two."
2,Two words for you: The Bangles,"Well, OK. So the lyrics are a bit more profound than the Bangles, but compared to the sonic innovations of Portishead and Massive Attack, this music is really flat. And while only the most cynical moron would ever believe that Courtney had her late husband killed, the Nick Broomfield documentary leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oops, can't say that, though. If you do you might incur the vicious wrath of Love's legal team. At least she cares about the grand American tradition of suing people. Don't fall for the manipulation."
1,This album is a Turkey,"The raw energy this band once possessed has really gone. The music sounds hollow and contrived,almost plastic. Really sad."
1,There should be a 0 star or less for this...,"(to ""Celebrity Skin"") Oh buy this album... We quickly whipped it out... It kinda really sucks... Blah blah...This was the worst piece of tripe of 1998. No talent, no music, totally commercial..."
1,No Kurt....no Hole....,"It's obvious the Kurt Cobain was the true driving force behind the last Hole album. Courtney, although a talented performer, has never shown a true ability to write. Many music fans got the feeling the the last Hole album was Cobain throwaways or gifts to Courtney. Now she has proven herself to be the 'bogus' talent that we all suspected with this album. Finding a difficult middle ground between her new cleaned up self and the old herion whore look- she finds herself no where- with no guidence from her late husband she just flounders here with a sad tribute to nothing important."
4,"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot","Celebrity Skin is excellent album with riviting music and deep lyrics. Each song has a distinct flavor, keeping you at the edge of your seat as each song passes by. Courtney's voice is raspy and cuts deep into you with every word she sings while ripping cords on her guitar. The softest song on the album, ""Dying"", is a powerfully emotional song, creating a strong backbone for the rest album. All and all, Hole have really out done themselves with this album, creating something strong yet soft and emotional. Good job, Courtney."
5,A great album!,"This album is great! I bought it after hearing ""Malibu"". It's quite differnt from ""Live Through This"". All the songs on this album are great, so if you like any song you've heard on the radio, ""Celebrity Skin"", ""Malibu"", or ""Awful"", for example, you will love the album. One of my favourite songs are ""Northern Star"" (not to be mixed up with Mel C's song with the same title). This is one of favourite albums! Buy it!"
4,This CD is pretty cool.,"This is the first Hole CD, I've listened to. I think it's really awesome. Two of my friends like it too. So does one of my friend's mom."
4,This is a pretty good CD....,"When I first heard ""Celebrity Skin"" on the radio, I thought ""Wow, that's a cool song, but I bet the rest of the Cd is just grunge."" But I was wrong. I listened to the CD at a music store and on the computer and liked it a lot. I know some people are disappointed with Hole because they maybe aren't hard rock/grunge anymore, I feel like Courtney has grown-up since their groups last CD. Sure, they might not have the same edge as they used to, but this CD is still really good. It has some 'adult-type' songs, but you have to admit once you listen to it that it's good."
3,ummm....this thing is okay,"well, this cd isn't so bad. it's still loud i think...if you turn it up...i like malibu...but nothing else too much. kay? bye now"
3,Unfortunately average.,"I'm surprised at the lack of 3-star ratings for this. Having been a fan of M.S. since BEFORE their Christmas music, I was hoping for more; more depth, more agelessness, etc. What we're left with is mostly not much more than modern themed ""muzak"". On the plus side, there is a constant flow of tracks, some segues being quite a delight. Also: the track ""Harvest Dance"" is far above the mundane. So...worth the low price (for ""wallpaper music""), but a weak entry from the great M.S. All in all, it's unfortunately average. yeah"
1,Worst Halloween Music Collection of All-Tyme !,"This CD was hyped as an excellent ,'Halloween Treat'.Well,I was one of the many who were 'Tricked' into buying this crappy CD.Listener Beware!Recycle it! Avoid It ! Nuff said."
4,Barbra is Worth the 12 Bucks,"For those wondering whether to purchase the Streisand version or the original Broadway cast, I would say definitely get the Broadway cast. Barbra does not fail in the movie soundtrack in the slightest; however, the original has the better of male leads and also includes some of the songs cut from the movie (the same songs that have become my favorites!). Still, if you can manage, definitely get both...Barbra is always worth it!"
5,"""Rare and Wonderful""","Only going as far as #108 on the Billboard Pop Charts way back in 1970, ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever"" is really one of the few Barbra Streisand records to bomb sales wise. Most of her recordings, both in-studio and soundtrack recordings, have either gone Gold or Platinum, but unfortunately this album didn't sell. Perhaps it was the fact that the movie wasn't a big box office success at the time that led to the soundtrack selling poorly, but this CD does have its highlights and extraordinary moments.Ten tracks are included here and my favorites are ""On a Clear Day"", ""Go To Sleep"", ""He Isn't You"" and ""What Did I Have That I Don't Have"", all recorded by Barbra.The DVD to this film has now gone out-of-print and is now one of Miss Streisand's hardest-to-find movies."
5,Good if the pda falls as it absorbs the shock of the phone being dropped,It works and the price is right. The product is simple and easy to use. I would recommend it to others.Good if the pda falls as it absorbs the shock of the phone being dropped
5,I jut had to write a review about this excellent cd,"Jazz roots meets avant garde at its best! the band is top notch and the sound (as most Lacy recordings) is great...not lush, over produced stuff like you would find on a Marsalis recording , instead you will hear warm , delightful analog type of sound which to me is the best you can get from a recording. The playing from all is very good and the compositions seem to have one foot on the traditions of jazz while another foot is pointing at a posible future (which could have saved jazz from its iminent death)...a great cd from a true artist."
5,Papo Pteranodon Figure,"This is a wonderful Pteranodon. Papo figures are exquisitely hand painted and relatively lifelike. Although this is a small figure, I believe it to be the most realistic of all the versions I have seen. Contrary to a previous review I believe that there is value in this meticulously, hand painted figure ( I did however pay less than said reviewer). It is a personal favorite in my dino. collection."
2,20 minutes of plate spinning,"I assume this tape gets better after a while, but I didn't get past what seemed like 20 minutes of plate spinning. It's weird at the beginning, not what I expected!"
5,Powerful Food for Powerful Minds & Bodies,Fantastic book. It has tons of great information and is easy to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to feel better and have more energy!
4,Great for a beginner,"This software is addictive. Although it is Calcutta Bangla vs. Banglasdesh Bangla, it's fun to learn using this format."
4,Great boots,"Ok, so I know these are kind of 'fetish boots' but I think they're perfect for rainy days. They're rubber (waterproof) and high heels (feminine) Plus, they don't look exactly like rubber, so you can get away with wearing them out. They are comfy (if you like heels), but seem to run a half size small."
3,Its Just Not That Good,I grew up in the era when these tunes came out so I recognized most of the names of the bands and the songs; but this CD is just not that good. There are only about 1/3 of the songs on this CD that are worth hearing again; that leaves 18 that are not that good. If I had it to do over again I would not purchase this CD.
2,One-hit wonders for a reason.,"I wonder if we'll see a Nuggets in 2040 with ""Oops...I Did it Again"" or ""Wannabe,"" because that's basically what this box set amounts to. I saved the $$ and bought this based upon a tremendous number of positive reviews. The first listen was fantastic. Every listen since then got worse and worse and I sold the damn thing a few weeks ago. Like any other musical movement (grunge being the best example), the psychedelic genre appears to have been populated with a few true artists and otherwise crammed full of no-talent hacks. There are some great bands represented here and a few great tracks worth repeated listening (Nazz, 13th Floor Elevators), but there is not enough material to even fill two discs, let alone four. Discs three and four wear thin very quickly, especially with the dopey frat rock of ""Wooly Bully"" and ""Louie Louie."" Lavishly packaged with wonderful liner notes, it's a shame the material represented simply wasn't of a higher caliber."
3,The best tracks are classics. The rest? Ehhh....,"This is one heck of a mixed collection. This is to be expected from an assortment of (mostly) lesser-known '60s pop songs, I suppose. While the best tracks are truly incredible, priceless ""nuggets,"" there are quite a few songs that I don't care if I ever hear again. This is great stuff for rabid '60s archaeologists, but keep in mind that you probably WON'T like everything on this album. I just made a couple of custom cassette tapes of my faves from it."
5,"Great, great collection -- but just scratches the surface","Wow, 120 songs on 4 CDs, and they are almost all killer, no filler. You know the sixties was an absolutely incredible decade for music when even the *obscure* stuff was good! Never mind the Beatles, Hendrix, Dylan, Stones, Doors, and all the rest, a lot of this stuff ranks right up there as my favorite '60s tunes.For all its seeming breadth, however, this 4-CD collection barely scratches the surface. I am still waiting for cleaned up, remastered versions of tunes like ""Crackin' Up"" by the Wig, ""I'll Be Gone"" by the Opposite Six, ""You Better Look Now"" by the Rogues, ""I Can't Stand This Love"" by the Others, and on and on.If you want to dig a little deeper, check out the ""Essential Pebbles"" collections. The sound quality isn't as stellar as Nuggets, but the songs are."
2,A film about people,"This film got a fair amount of buzz in its time but I had never seen it. Having been interested by some of Nicholson's work (Head, Witches of Eastwick, Chinatown) I thought, in a weak moment, that it might be good to own a copy of this.It is a film about people I wouldn't want to know relating deeply with other people I wouldn't want to know and has few other qualities which stand out after a first viewing. I give it two stars rather than one because it was, I suppose, professionally done."
2,Mostly Boring -,"Jack Nicholson is a surly, unreliable oil rig worker who has left a childhood life of privilege and music to bounce around. Hearing that his father is dying, he returns home, reluctantly taking his pregnant airhead girlfriend. (Ironically, she's into singing country-western songs that grate on Nicholson.) Embarrassed by her lack of polish, Nicholson stashes her in a nearby motel while he visits his family. While there he seduces his brother's bride-to-be, but she refuses to go with him because he loves nobody and nothing. After leaving with his girlfriend, Nicholson decides to return to his home and pursue his new-found love.I have no idea why this movie is held in such high regard."
4,This is an different look for music,This Canadian band brings a different look to music that I personally thought was good. It is not crude and their voices are easy to listen to. I was very impressed by their music.
4,"entertaining throughout, exciting as well as plausable.","This is a very good read for a bargain book, well written and very descriptive. Not religious but quite realistic. It did seem to drag in places but not enough to deter one from reading and enjoying."
5,The very BEST of the BEST,"This is the BEST book on windows NT driver. I own 6 or 7 books on Windows NT driver, but this is the only one that I carry around with me at all time. This book really helped me with my project at work, especially, the chapter on PCI and memory mapping. I am in love with this book. Can't leave home without it."
2,Note: The Book does not cover many types of drivers!,"I just received the book and I immediately turned to the index to search for NETWORK DRIVERS. Nope. Well, the introduction chapter will tell you ""what we don't cover"" (this important omission should of been mentioned in the online book excerpts):The book does not cover: File Drivers, Network Drivers, Graphic Drivers and User Mode Drivers.One would think that in this day of age of Communications, High End Speed Games, etc, that a rather large book titled ""Developing Windows NT Device Drivers"" would cover these important device drivers. At a minimum, its should of covered NDIS Device Drivers. It does not."
2,The worst of Miossec's CD,"If you want to discover french rock of the end of 20 century, Miossec is certainly a good choice, but ""Prendre"" is defenitly the worst CD Miossec did. ""Boire"" and ""Baiser"" are far better."
5,Exceptional Yellowstone guide,"Yellowstone Treasures, by Janet Chapple, is the key to appreciating this beautiful park. Because the book is organized into Road Logs, wherever you are you read about what's coming up next: geological phenomena, animals, trees, flowers, trail heads, lakes and human history are all included. The maps are clear, plentiful, accurate and useful. Each section is amply expanded with information boxes about things such as how geysers work, how terraces are built, how the names of places were chosen, petrified trees, geological mysteries, etc. The chapters on geological phenomena, human history, flora and fauna are a gold mine of information. Take the book with you, but look at the website http://www.yellowstonetreasures.com/ well beforehand, because it is also a treasure. We were never without this book during our visit."
5,Fabulous guide to Yellowstone,"I just took this book to Yellowstone and found it indispensible! We quickly gave up using the official park guides to the various geyser basins and relied on this book to tell us all about the different geysers and their histories. The book is packed with information about the history of Yellowstone. It even has a flora and fauna guide! Included are lists of suggested sights to see, hikes to take, driving distances, road maps (but no topo maps), discussions about how geysers work, the Yellowstone caldera, the 1988 fires, where to stay, etc. The book is printed on nice paper and the photos are in full color. This is really an indispensible book to bring along on your next visit to Yellowstone!"
1,The plot is lazy and worn out!,"Hapka had me going and had an interesting plot in the working for the first Lost book, but had changed drastically in the second. I had the feeling that in Secret Identity Dexter was ultimately going to find first hand the punishments of his untruthfulness, but also see what was going to happen between Kate and the cop and relize he needed to enjoy his own life. This book was a major let down. Sounds more like a bedtime story or short stories, definately not a novel done by a esteemed writer. Pass on this, but read the first one if you are a die hard Lost fan."
2,Better than the first? I think not.,"I am not sure why everyone is stating that this book was an improvement over the first book. I thought of the 3 paperbacks, this was by far the worst! It was just a terrible storyline, the encounters with the characters from the show are cheesy and/or too coincidental, and it was too much in the way of flashing back. Every other chapter was a flashback. I was very dissappointed with this and I did not feel it supported the series. I am a big lost fan and I found this to be a poorly written story. If more of these books are going to be released, I would hope the ABC lost writers would have some input and perhaps review them thoroughly before releasing them."
3,Amazon-A+ Altec-C-,"I could not get the first one sent to work at all. Amazon immediately sent another and the second unit works, but only if you fiddle with it quite a bit to get the antenna conected. I had called Altecs customer service line but they said I had to return it to the retailer. Amazon was quick and responsive to my problem. I have bought things from Amazon before and will certainly continue to do so now."
1,Poor headphone sound,I bought this with high hopes of being able to listen to xm radio while at my desk. The problem with the poorly made unit is that the headphone jack is not properly shielded and you hear bad static while listening to music. Not a big deal while listening to music but a huge problem when listening to talk radio.The shipped fitting plates do not fit the new xpressr receivers but the new receiver will work with not plate attachment.I returned this unit and will get something of better quality.
2,i will live with it,"Radio came in very fast. Did not include antenna as shown in picture. Volume dial only worked the first time I turned it on, and I think it went to full volume. OK for jobs but not for at home use. Not really satisfied but I guess you get what you pay for. Wish it worked right"
4,I really liked this.,I got this to use my XM Radio with in the house. The volume was right for me. I never mounted the receiver though because I brought the base with me to my two jobs as well as home. It got good reception for the most part. I ended up selling this on eBay for the same price I bought the new one for so you can't beat the price on Amazon at all. Overall it's a good product with a good pricetag.
1,clip,the order was never really placed because they didnt have it in stock; but it would've been nice to have it for use.
1,Product description is NOT correct,"If you really need a RED light as the product description says, do not order this light. The output is White.I've just wasted the purchase and shipping price because it is way to much hassle to return it for credit."
1,College Prowler a Bust,"Hated it, returned it almost immediately.Not helpful whatsoever. We found it to be beyond useless when looking for info about colleges, frankly."
4,could've been better,"includes the first four eps of season 2:ep 201 growing pains -- season opener, first appearance of the younger class (jubilee, cannonball, etc.), avalanche exposes the mutants to the school, but the professor wipes their mindsep 202 badda bing badda boom -- boom boom's father forces her to steal moneyep 203 power surge -- jean grey's powers threaten to overwhelm herep 204 fun and games -- the x-men throw a party while the professor is away, but a student named arcade accidentally stumbles into the danger roomextras inc: language features, episode intros by the director frank paur, and a few other things that i haven't checked yet, prob. just bios on the characters. all in all sort of disappointing, since the rest of the episodes from season 1 haven't been put out and the first 4 eps of season 2 were def. not the best of the season. still, it's better than nothing."
4,I still like it.,"A pretty good start to the second season. Have to remember not to expect the story to match up with the older X-Men stories, but it is a fun series for any Marvel or just X-Men fan."
5,vicar is always awsome,we already had the boxed set of the vicar of dibley and saw the specials on pbs so when we saw they were out on dvd we just had to have them! As always the vicar is awsome.
3,"Mr.Crane, If You Please","nice little book, I AM INTERSETED IN READING MORE ABOUT THIS TOWN ARCADIA AND THE AREA AROUND IT."
5,The first pair of scissors you'll reach for,Have had these marvelous scissors for several years now and find they're the first I reach for in the kitchen. The blades are sharp but thin so they can get into odd places. I find them particularly useful for everything from mincing parsley to opening that horrible hard plastic packaging that all the manufacturers love. The red handles also make them easy to spot in a drawer. They're lightweight enough to use even for extended periods while their handles are comfortable enough to never produce blisters. Highly recommended
4,Fun,"If you're looking for serious drama then you're in the wrong place. I would describe AVENUE MONTAIGNE as a ""fun"" movie. In many ways it reminded me of THE SPANISH APARTMENT (or L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE): both consisted of a bunch of colorful characters, who are trying to find their way in this crazy world of ours. It should be no surprise that Cecile France was in both films. She has a way of connecting with other actors on screen. She was a delight. Other notable actors in AVENUE were the ""soap"" actress, the pianist and the auctioner's son. If you just want to see a movie for just strictly entertainment value, then I highly recommend AVENUE MONTAIGNE."
2,Looks nice but does not make a gourmet cup of coffee!,"I was so exicted to get this unit for Xmas from my wife in 2004...and from the first cup on, I have been dissappointed. It usely produces a cup of coffee with metallic flavor. I have tried various mixes and proportions, high quality beans and always use bottled water. It is keep clean (ALL components) and descaled, yet the coffee always tastes the same to me-sub-standard. I have had various Krupps heating pad brewers (which made good coffee) and decided it was time to get this all in one unit. I have the same compliants others have about the moisture and steam creeping up into the bean holder, lukewarm coffee after an hour and finding coffee spilling from God know's where onto the counter. After drinking coffee at our local cafe and occassionally Starbucks, I am spoiled and will continue my search for a better unit. Look for this unit at our next yardsale."
5,'Grind and Brew' Review,I have been using my new 'Grind and Brew' machine for about 2 weeks now and realy like its ease of use. It's features are nice and also quite simple to use and remember. Overall one of the main reasons for my purchase of this type and brand of coffee maker was the thermal insulated carafe. It really does what it says it will...it keeps the coffee hot! Not only does it keep the coffee hot for at least 6 hours...but it does so without compromising the taste of the coffee. It makes an excellent tasting coffee because the brew water temperture is hot and that is key in any good coffee.
1,Makes a Mess,"My Cuisinart Grind-and-Brew is more trouble than convenience. I've had the basket drawer open multiple times mid-brew or mid-grind, sending water, coffee, grounds etc all over my kitchen counter, dripping into drawers and cabinets. It has not been worth the cost."
2,Thermal Lid failure,"We've been using this product for a while now, and recently, the lid to the coffee pot has 'failed'. The water does not flow thru the lid fast enough, causing everything to backup and leave a big mess on the counter - nearly every single time.I recently ordered a new lid from Cuisinart - $8 plus shipping.I've cleaned the lid by soaking in vinigar and running vinigar thru the brewing process a couple times, but while some coffee particles came out, the thing still leaves a mess on the counter.If you have been using this product for a while, be forwarned!"
2,"Informative, but designed for high school","I have been interested in propaganda and persuasion for some time now, so when I learned about this book I was very excited. The text itself is a brief overview of 88 or so propaganda techniques. Each is described in about 3 lines, and include an example. The explanations are clear, but not in depth. The work is suitable for someone seeking an encyclopedia-style knowledge.The formatting appears to be a Word Document that has been put straight to press, untouched.All in all, if you're looking for a succinct crash course, this may work. If you're truly looking for information, look to Age of Propaganda."
5,Great renditions of your favorites. Really different.,Our son lives in Honolulu. This Christmas he brought home this CD. It was our favorite! We went to the islands this January and attended a Kopono concert! What a treat!
4,No Stevie Nicks?,"Let me be the FOURTH reviewer to say. Why is Stevie Nicks not part of this? Also, it would have been nice if Cass Elliot would have been included or a Mammas & Pappas song but it is not as glaring as the ommission of Stevie Nicks. And I like Patsy Cline just fine but she is a COUNTRY singer."
3,Just Average,"I wasn't as impressed with this collection as I thought I would be. A lot of the songs were ones I had either never heard or disliked because of the complete lack of talent the performer displayed, and some of the songs were rap or R&B instead of rock. I liked about half the songs on each CD."
3,Good but defeatable,"A good theft deterrent, but it would be better to put the cable through a hole drilled in the table; though not as pretty."
3,It was interesting,"I read this book for school, and even thought my time was pressed, I enjoyed it. Read it : )"
3,eh....,"After ""Us And Them"" by the London *Philharmonic* this sounds just... lukewarm. It doesn't give me wings, nore does it bring tears to my eyes, in awe of the sheer beauty of it all... it's ok I guess... but ""OK"" is not the word you want when describing a band like Pink Floyd."
5,Memory Upgarde,I went from 1 GB of memory to 2 GB with the Corsair Memory. It installed fine and doubled my speed. Great product!
2,What's in a number?,"This is a cute little book, full of interesting tid-bits, characters and anectodes, but none useful or worth remembering. One does not need to be a mathematician to enjoy reading it, but it would be hard to really enjoy this booklet without some background.At the end of it all, we still do not really understand the ""real"" mystery of this most famous number."
3,GOOD,I GOT THIS FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I WA TIRED OF THE ONE I HAD BUT THE BALLS ON THIS ONE KEPT FALLING OFF SO I WENT BACK TO THE ONE I HAD BEFORE I DIDNT WANT TO GLUE MYSELF ON TO IT BY ANY MEANS
2,MISLEADING COLOR DESCRIPTION,"My husband and I just unpacked the entertainment center for our vacation home and are very disappointed with the color. The description and the picture shown on Amazon site leads you to believe that the ET center to be off-white or creamy white. What you get is more of a lemon custard. It clashes with all white decor of my living room. If it's the soft yellow you want, this is a good bet. Putting it together was very simple, no instruction is provided since most of it is already put together for you. If this had truly been a white entertainment center, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Excellent Resource,This handbook was worth its weight in gold. I read and applied the principles to my own mediation session and was amazed at how things went smoothly. I highly encourage anyone that is thinking about going through the mediation process to check this book out.
5,Rage Rocks Mexico City,"When I watched this DVD for the first time I was impressed at how well it captured the feeling of being at the concert. I was at the Oakland concert on this tour and i remember what it was like wading through swarms of people to get close to Rage (to see how Tom was making the noises on the new album). In response to a previous review, which erroneously stated that the DVD was censored, there is more than one audio track on the disc, including a regular stereo and a 5.1 channel track. The stereo track plays bby default and is censored, but the 5.1 channel audio is NOT! All you have to do is change the audio track and you get to hear the concert without annoying silences every now and then."
2,"Rage rocks, but not this DVD","Argg!! Rage Against the Machine is an awesome band and can kick the crap out of you any time you spin one of their albums. But I scream out in frustration every time I watch this DVD. The reason? They couldn't just play their footage.For some reason, some stupid fool had to insert a large number of random little things of slow-motion and quick cuts to black and white. I was nearly screaming at the TV every time it happened. You'll be rockin' out feelin' the energy of the crowd and Rage and for some reason at some totally unclimactic and random moment it will cut to slow motion. Incredibly annoying. I would have give this 1 star, but I don't think I can do that with Rage Against the Machine on it."
5,this video rules,"if you liked rage's THE BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES or any song froma past record you will love this video!!!! this is one of Rages best performances caught on tape. the intense & funky sounds will make u want to stand up and jump all over the place like Zach de la Rocha, i myself couldn't wait for my friend to leave the room so i could put on my guitar and play all the rage songs i know along with Tom Morello and look like a fool by myself."
3,"get the other DVD, its better","I'm a huge rage fan, sadly, this DVD is just ""okay"".Good Things: * good set/song list. * good video/audio quality.Bad Things: * all footage is from one concert. * the venue was small and Rage seems to be lacking energy or dare I say, rage. * director resorts to ... MTV camera tricks to make up for the lack of energy. * Too much preaching in between songs with Zach overextending some analogous movements that don't really make sense. Its kind of embarrasing."
3,An ok DVD,"Rage Against The Machine are one of the BEST live bands ever.But there are many flaws to this DVD.The live concert is great,but why did they include the dreadful ""Zapata's Blood"" instead of ""Bullet In The Head""?Also,every song with cussing except ""Killing In The Name"" is edited.The worst thing is the slo-mo shots.Zach and Tom are known for their stage presences,why put in slo-mo?Also,the docunmentary footage is in between songs.Why couldn't they have had this has a bonus feature?Also,there is absolutely NO connection between the band and audience.Zach talks to the crowd a lot on the other 2 DVDS,why not this one?The intro sucks to.They should should have shown the scene they describe on the back of the box.This is an OK DVD,but the other 2 are much better.The 3 stars is for the live show alone.Star with the Grand Olypmpic show,then get the self-titled one,then this."
5,So cool!,"""So little time"" is my favourite soap opera and Mery-Kate and Ashley Olsen are two of my favourite actrices.Chloe and Rileyare SO COOl!"
2,Good Manrico but disappointing on the whole,"This one has the best sound of the three live Trovatore performances with Callas, 1950 Mexico, 1952 Naples and 1953 La Scala (this one). Callas is good but nothing more. She is dramatically uninteresting and almost boring sometimes. Ebe Stignani and Carlo Tagliabue are past their prime and wobbly. The only somewhat interesting main cast member is the Manrico of Gino Penno. He is not the league of Franco Corelli, Jussi Bjorling or Placido Domingo, whom I consider the best in the role, but he does a good job with the role.Antonio Votto is somewhat uninteresting also. We get none of the exciting dramatic reading like we get from Karajan or Serafin. It is much more sedated.So to conclude, this performance is not recommended to anyone except those of has to have every live recording of Callas' Leonora."
2,Too much garbage,"I have C++ How to Program, first 6 chapter I guess two books are very identical.For introduction to OOP, maybe author should write a new book, like OOP How to Program, but not for all How to Program book.Lot of example are very identical, i guess they just convert C++ or whatever to C# How to Program"
1,Confusing and just pages of unexplain code.,"The Deitel's write a lot of books, but it looks likethey copied a lot from their C++ book.The books starts off good, but quickly becomes confussing."
2,Poor Book,"I have been teaching both c++ and visual basic for the past several years. I attempted to use the Deitel book to grasp c# and found it very hard to follow. It seems they attmpted to write a book that pleases both newbies and seasoned programmers alike, in my opinion it does niether very well."
1,I felt like I wasted my money.,After the glowing review I decided to try this product out. After only 3 hours this disc was useless to me. There is very little information on here let alone useful information. In no time one can complete the entire program. There aren't any pronouns included which I expected would have minimally been there. The disc also can't be run off of the hard drive so one has to wait for the program to load every few seconds while listening to the life of ones cd drive wear away. A great idea that has fallen horribly short. A simple phrase book would have been more beneficial.
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this for my TV room. We have had it for 6 months. It has had only very light use but looks just awful. The fuzzy nap is completely pilled up. Little bits of stuff are caught up in the pilled nap. I do not know what I can even do with it. It can't be washed. It arrived looking ok but in less than 6 months it is ready for the trash.I would like to know who reviewed the the blanket. The reviews were so exceptional I almost bought more than one. I am glad I waited to see how it worked out.
1,1 botton to win,"It only takes one button to win a fight. I think it is the X button on the xbox game. To win the game it takes three button. Yes i won the game in 20 min. with X,A and B. My frinds came over with the game and I kick them out of my home.The more peple that hate on this ""thing"" the better."
4,Vintage Guitar magazine review:,"This album has everything going for it: The band's got a great moniker, their playing is tight, and the music is right. The Hot Club of Cowtown hails from Austin, Texas---which is about as far as you can get from Paris, France, in everything but hot music. This trio plays classic western swing with traces of its namesake, the Hot Club of France, thrown in. Consider this Bob Wills with a beret or Django Reinhardt in cowboy boots. It's hot stuff."
1,Danmaged Disc,"At least one of the discs is damaged - ""Deception on His Mind"". I have cleaned the lens on the player just to be sure, and the picture shill breaks up then freezes."
2,boring,"Weber writes well -- it's easy to see, in my mind's eye, what he's describing...I just never cared. I read about half the book and never made a connection with it. The characters were flat, the story was not interesting to me...if this book was a color, it would be beige. I didn't finish it, and it's headed to the used book store."
4,A fine series,"Weber' s tendency to insert pages of trivial minutae between ""Hello"" and ""captain"" is certainly annoying. These are fine reads though. I just needed to jump ahead to the next open parentheses mark once in a while."
1,Farsi,"If you are only interested in learning a few words, then this is for you. was hoping i could load it on to the computer but you need the disk to use this. While travling it hampers use because you use your disk drive which wears on the battery. You must carry aroud another Disk."
3,WORKS AS A WILL FIT.,"WORKMENSHIP POOR ,MADE IN CHINA BUT WITH A LITTLE WORK YOU CAN MAKE IT FIT , SHOULD OF SAID IT. MADE IN CHINA"
2,Clarification on the Companion or Accompanying CD,"The reviewers have referred to a companion CD or accompanying CD. Many computer books come with what is often called a companion CD or CD-ROM in the back of the book. Be advised that when you buy this book, you will not find the companion CD or accompanying CD in the back of the book. You will not find an internet address to download the sounds. You will find an order form in the back of the book to order the CD for $16.95 plus shipping costs. Try pronouncing the mantra ""Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayaat"" without an audio clip."
1,Who knows,"I never received the product. The shipping date was pushed back beyond the date of my trip and I really did not see a need for this after I returned from the Netherlands. I am not sure why I was asked to review an order I cancelled but, that's what happens when your customer service is run by robots with cute names like Tina L, Gerry M, Adolf H, etc."
3,You can tell when albums are made in a week,"Jesse Powell's self-titled debut album was very underrated. After he released ""I Wasn't With It"" off THIS album, people finally realized that Jesse had talent (even though that's not the best song he's ever done). But for fans looking for another stellar album like his debut in `Bout It, be ready for some disappointment.To be frank, this album is boring. The only song that really stands out is ""You"", and that was on his first album. Then there's the unnecessary remix of ""I Wasn't With It"", as well as the song that accompanies the album's played-out title, ""'Bout It, `Bout It"". That song doesn't really help or hurt the album. There's also ""She Wasn't Last Night"", which is something that men don't say.In the end, `Bout It really isn't all it's cracked up to be. It has ten tracks but only eight original songs. And I, like most people, didn't hear his third album JP, but I just hope it's more creative than this album is."
3,Worth the Money,"This is great addition to any collection. It's soothing and not hard to listen to. This is the type of CD that you can play when you just want to chill or when you have company. It's not over-powering, yet it adds to the mood of the evening. A must have. If all else fails, the song ""You"" is worth the price of the CD alone."
3,Does not work with Cakewalk Guitar Tracks Pro 4,"Beware. This is a nice little mixer, but check compatibility with your software before purchasing. I use Cakewalk Guitar Tracks Pro 4 on Windows 7 for my recording. The drivers for this unit do not work with my software. I ended up using my POD XT Live drivers, which work amazingly. So I am basically using this as a standard mixer now, going through my POD. . . which is not why I bought it."
5,Great Replacement Option,"I needed a new fan set because one of my fans stopped working. I asked a buddy who is huge into xbox gaming and he said they were pretty solid. I was going to buy an original OEM replacement set; however, I figured the extra air flowwas worth it since my xbox (elite, 2007 model) is getting older.I got the green to match xbox default colors. Honestly, I did not care about the led lighting and would have purchased a non-lit version. However, the green glow hitting the wall behind my xbox is not annoying. Its kind of cool; they are very bright.As for air flow, there is no way to test this; however, there is a good, warm breeze coming out of the back of my xbox as expected. I did compare the blades on this versus the original. These blades are slightly larger because the middle of the fan is ever so slightly smaller and the blades also are ever so slightly deeper.In all, I'm pretty satisfied with this."
1,Yuck!,My daughter hated these! But I wanted to give them a try because she won't eat vegetables. My neighbor recommended them because her daughters eat them and love them.
2,Not dependable,"The bulbs burn out frequently. The fixtures themselves tend to stop working altogether after a fairly short time. I have one set that's been in use for two or three years and it's fine, but another set has bit the dust. Not a very durable product."
1,You Will Replace These Often,"Be forewarned, these seem pretty sexy; They're small and flat with good light output and they use direct 110 - so no transformers, and with promising ""10,000 hour"" lifetime (right on the packaging) the Feit under cabinet fluorescent puck lights seem great. The problem is that they don't last 1/4th as long as promised! I have been using these intermittently for exactly 18 months and 3 of the four of them now have burnt out (curiously, all at the same time) and need replacing. They're about 10 bucks a piece btw. Doing this again, I would steer away from these buggers and get some LED lights (which will likely come much closer to the rated life of the Feits). What is surprising is that Feit would not make an LED version, since they distribute some other LED products. Similar reviews follow this product elsewhere on the web."
2,That was pretty bad.,"I am not sure why there are so many spinoff books of the show like this, or better yet why they get published. This book kept me fairly interested in the beginning, but it just fell very, very flat.The ending is extremely STUPID, and absolutely corny.Don't bother with this book, it wont fulfil your need for the show between episodes."
3,Books Ok,"I love the TV show Lost and watch it faithfully every week. I turned to these books as a filler when the reruns are on, and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. They're interesting, but the show is constructed in such a way that so much of what you see means something and hints at what is to come, and there just isn't a way to do that in the books without messing up the series. A similiar book I enjoyed, that reads kind of like the show, is An Actor's Nightmare. If you like the show, you should check it out. It's better than these books. Still, I'll probably keep reading the Lost books too. Fans are fans. :)"
3,Decent Enough,"This Book gives a good Bio of many of the Stars but Mr Hofstedemakes too many mistakes or leaves out details.Here are two:He says that the Giant got dropped on his head at Souled 97 butit actually occurred on January 24 at WCW/NWO Souled Out.He alsowhen mentioning the Owen Hart/Steve Austin Incident forgets topoint out it was a Tombstone Piledriver, not a Regular Piledriver.Before this Person ever writes another book onWrestling, I Suggest he Watch every WWF,WCW, and ECW Pay-Per-View to make damn sure he gets his dates and times right."
5,"Superb, Digital Stereo","Back in 1939, audio recording was tinny and horrible by today's standards. This movie's soundtrack was no exception.However, digital technology has come a long way, including the ability to simulate stereo. For the most part, the hissing and scratching are gone in this CD, and many passages are in what sounds like true stereo.It's a treat for those of us who hate mono.This is the best Wizard of Oz original soundtrack recording available. And as somebody else said, the popup in the cardboard keepcase is unexpected and very cool.Highly recommended."
2,Bland.,"This album is boring, it sounds disjointed and uncoordinated. The melodies beaumont hannant creates end up ruined by lida husiks bad vocals, they did a much much better job on Green Blue Fire released under the name Husikesque."
2,Very general,This book is supposed to be a begginners guide to discus but it is so general that for me it practically worthless
2,Poorly,Did not appreciate a book from a library. Will be contacting the library is see if book was stolen!!!!!
2,Code does not work,"The first example that is shown in this book does not work... I have tried everything and cannot get it to work... So that leaves me to believe I will be wasting my time if I continue. I actually decided to build my application with Cold Fusion MX and Flash MX instead of .Net and Flash. When I first got the book there was no supporting code on the website even available .. but when I checked again the code was there for the download.. but I am going to try Cold Fusion now since I was so frustrated with the example - line by line .. that did not work. He did not give very clear directions. He did not tell you ""in the first frame in the Action Layer insert the following.. he assumed you knew that I guess.. I tried it every possible way and still could not get it to work..."
2,For Aesthetic Purpose only.,"If you're looking for a ""narrow far reaching beam"", look elsewhere. These lights do not produce any real output. They are good if you only want to ""look cool"".As stated in another review, these are the same lights as sold in AutoZone or AdvanceAuto stores.The housing is made from pretty durable plastic, and the lens is glass.It comes with a wiring harness that can be used, but is of a low AWG wire.They are pretty shallow in depth, allowing you to mount them virtually anywhere."
2,Zzzzzzzzz,I didn't make it through the entire movie. It was very difficult to stay focused. Boring to say the least. I can't even say what the message was. I don't know what it is lacking and I hate being critical but it was a waste of my time.
4,"Fun to read, and learn to trade teh Forex","I own both books of Raghee. The book describes the way she scans the market and how she makes her entries and exits. Reading the book is fun as her passion for the markets is so clearly written, also her web seminars are in the same style. If you want to lear to trade FOREX, certanly have a look at this book. It is to the point no nonsense easy to understand written. And she trades her own money and wrote a book. Something that is seldom seen as most writers are writers but not traders. And traders are trading and not writing :-)Wessel"
1,David G.,"This is easily the worst book ever written about forex. It's simplistic in the worst possible way and assumes that the readers have a mind of 5 year old child. The trading strategies mentioned in the book are mostly worthless and are based on standard technical indicators, but oversimplified in such a way that they can never actually work in real world trading. Save yourself the money and get a book from more mature writers. Other reviews of this book recommend several very good alternatives so I am not going to repeat it. If you know absolutely nothing about forex, this book may even be more dangerous than no information, because of the mentioned over-simplification."
3,Pretty Good,"I'm an intermediate exerciser who likes to add Tae Bo in the mix of my other exercise routines (DVDs). Just finished doing this DVD for the first time. The feel is similar to his Cardio Inferno DVD but a little more intense. There are some classic exercises along with some new ones. You have to think a little bit on some of the moves that have multiple steps. I gave it 3 stars because I wish he would have given a bit more instruction on the more complex moves. Also, there were some moves that were a bit awkward in the video. I will say that my favorite Tae Bo DVD is Tae Bo Amped, Full Throttle. S.O.S. isn't as intense as that one but it's still decent. All in all, I did like it, I did sweat a good amount and I will keep the DVD in my rotation."
1,bad service,"The item never showed up. USPS delivered it over 3 weeks after the order was placed. The box was full of old make-up, no blackberry. I had to deal with T-Mobile, because they continued to bill me for the service. Amazon did not offer to replace the phone or to help with dealing with TMobile. They did refund the cost of the blackberry."
3,Changed their tune and missed the charts,"The fourth and last album from the Derry, Ireland band was released in 1983 to a very disinterested public after the pre-release singles saw how they'd abandoned their shuffling, postpunk, eager teen energy for blue-eyed soul. They'd hit the UK top 20 a few times before this with such classics as ""My Perfect Cousin,"" but ""The Love Parade"" missed the top 40 and the cover of the Isleys' ""Got to Have You Back"" failed completely. Feargal Sharkey's voice is very strong, and the whole album's quite good, but it remains an unfortunate example of how to alienate your audience. Ryko's out of print domestic reissue included six bonus tracks; these are available on a pricy import of this fine final effort."
2,Still mystified.....,"I have been out of school for 10 years and did a complete brain dump of all things algebra upon graduating high school. Enter Pre-cal suddenly in college with no math refresher courses and here I was rushing to the web to find a book to quickly jump start me. Let me just keep this short by saying it didnt work. If you have a pretty good idea of what to do but need some help, this book would be decent but it's not for those who are completely clueless. Sadly, I fell into the latter category and still remain there."
4,The Merger of VideoDiscs with Computers in the early 1980's,"This book provides extensive discussion of interactive VideoDisc technology relating to the use of VideoDiscs as course instruction tools. The competing disc technologies of this time are discussed, but the emphasis is on reflective LaserDisc, as interactive CED VideoDiscs didn't reach the market until 1983."
2,Great phone but....,"As you can see, this phone became available in August 2005. I purchased my phone in the Fall and love it. Howver, I dropped the second handset in the dog's water dish and understandably so, it's broken. I have since tried to purchase another handset. The model has been discountinued. So, I have a phone with only one handset. Thus, I need to buy a whole new system in order to have more then one handset. My suggestion to the next buyer...research, research, research!"
5,Makes Listening Easy!,My family and I absolutely love the Bible Alive Cd's. It made our recent vacation easy for us to spend time with the Word. We would pop in a CD and listen to about 20-30 minutes of scripture each morning. We loved it! The musical background and change in voices of the characters keeps your attention while engaging you as if you were actually there in the setting. You won't be dissappointed if you purchase this product.
2,Couldn't find the right one!,"Die hard 3 was the first movie i saw in that series,as a soundtrack fans ,the motive i want to buy it maybe only one or two part of music that i may hard to find in the store . when simon get into the fedral bank , there was an music grab my feeling for 3 mins and couldn't help to buy it right after i left the theater.It's terrible disppoint that i couldn't found on the album, did there have anyone who can tell me what that is ? p.s music is good on that soundtrack ,couldn't found the one i like woule be my reason for two stars. Chsue"
2,When Johnny Comes Marching Home,"I dont personally own this soundtrack, however, awhile ago I was able to actually find the ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" score from this movie and I believe it is the correct version. Sadly it is not listed on the soundtrack, which would have been the only reason I would have bought this."
4,Très bon disque relatant les meilleurs moments du film.,"Ce disque est je pense aussi bon que le film lui mème,il retrace parfaitement l'ambiance du film;ainsi que les deux premiers; dommage que le premier soit introuvable.Je trouve que les deux morceaux de rap sont tout à fait dans les propos du film lorsque Bruce WILLIS se trouve dans Harlem.Disque à acheter absolument pour les inconditionnels de la trilogie,en attendant un quatrieme épisode."
5,Good Socks,"These are just the right socks to wear with casual boots or sneakers. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect colors to wear with jeans."
5,Great Socks,"These are the best socks that I ever owned. I would recommend these. They are great quality and hold up nicely. I owned Gold Toes before, and I had a pair last for over 6 years. I will order more again :)"
5,Gold Toe - Weekend Quality,"I got these socks to wear to work, since I work in a ""business casual"" environment. And I made a BIG mistake when I bought them. I should have gotten several packages at the same time. They're very comfortable and are holding up a lot better than my department store brand socks ever did. (One pair of those had a hole after two or three wearings!) They are definitely thicker than a dress sock, and slightly thicker than some casual socks, so if your shoes fit very tightly, these are probably not the socks you want. They are not as thick as a heavy winter wool or hiking sock, however. They are great with my casual shoes, though, and work very well with my work shoes. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for socks. The colors were very nice, too. Nice to get some quality socks that aren't shocking white for a change."
3,"Gold Toe Weekend Sock, women's","I like the colors and the feel of the material. But I'm disappointed in the gold toe....the toe seam is too thick and rubs my toes. I've had to turn the socks inside-out to reduce blisters. My 'older' socks don't have such a fat seam, the seam is more woven into the 'gold' toe. I've use Gold Toe for years and they usually wear well. No sure how these will do."
3,different cotton content than listed in description,I was looking for socks with a high percentage (75% or more) of cotton. The online description indicated the socks contained 87% cotton. However when I received the socks the label indicated they contain only 63% cotton.
1,Why Bravo Why?,"Ok first of all it is BEYOND me why Bravo gave this woman a show. She is the most bitter, nasty piece of toxicity. This show is so boring."
3,3 1/2 stars,"This is a good series even if you are not in the know about bethenny frankel (RHNYC). My best friend watched a couple of the shows on bravo with me and she doesn't watch any of the houswives series and thought bethenny's one liners were great. I even felt some empathy for bethenny when she was asked by the officiant (sp?) who would be at her wedding for her from her family and seeing bethenny's heartfelt reaction. If you like reality tv, pick this one to watch."
1,Good grief!,"This had to be the most poorly written, too too politically correct piece that I've ever read. The characters were phony, dull, and seemed unable to ever decide what they want to do and with whom. Ugh! A real stinker"
1,Tedious,"I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but Amie & Jason are a big snore. The only mystery here is how I got thru 3 of the five discs. Disc one was okay, although I did find Amie a bit off putting. Disc two I skipped tru every other tract & disc three I skipped thru every tract. The reason I was skipping was the constant interruption of the story for their blossoming romance. Now, I'm all for romance, love & sex but everytime these two stop moving they're all over each other, in the kitchen, the car, a closet, etc & when they weren't fondling each other they were thinking about it. This became syrupy, cloying, tedious & distracting from the story. Even though I skipped thru tracts I was able to follow the mystery line but by disc 3, I didn't care who had kidnapped &/or killed the chicken, I stopped listening. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the CD had been abridged but, then there might not have been any mystery."
1,Annoying,"I already reviewed this CD but my review isn't listed. If I could I wouldn't have given this any stars. I found this below par for Evanovich, truly foul play. I liked disc 1 but skipped thru many tracts on disc 2 & 3. I could still follow the story, indicating this was a two disc story. Unfortunately by disc three I didn't care about any of the characters, they were silly, childish & annoying. I was rooting for the only good character--The Rooster. I'll never know how the story turned out because I couldn't bring myself to listen any more. Don't waste your money."
1,foul book-,hardly worth the time it took to listen to this audio booki can't believe i finished it--would not recommend to anyone at any age.
2,Definitely not her best,I love Janet Evanovich - especially her Stephanie Plum series (they are hilarious and well worth the read)...but this one is way below par for her. I actually found it rather silly. Not a true picture of the writing this author is best known for.
3,Not one my favorites of Janet Evanovich's,"Janet Evanovich is one of my favorite authors. This book was a very quick read and pretty funny, but it doesn't have the same feel as her later books. It seemed rushed at the end. If you are looking for something fun to read, try her Stephanie Plum books! They are laugh out loud funny!"
5,Nada Personal,"This is a new direction for him, but as always a delight! Marc's voice never fails and in every song you can feel the emotion. Whom ever is a true Marc Anthony fan should pick up this cd and enjoy every second. Marc is truly outstanding! Can't wait for the next album and tour!"
1,I want my money back!,"The first release was a Salsa version yet ""Ahora Quien"" on the CD is a slow song. The entire CD is full of ballads. Why market a CD as Salsa or pop and fill it with Romantic ballads.I was extremely disappointed! I want my money back!"
1,Callas should sing pop instead of opera,Callas is not meant to sing opera. She sounds like a pop singer to me. All I hear is screaming.
2,"Books title should have been ""how to select a buyer's agent""","This is the only good advice I gained from this book.Also, to much focus on existing homes rather than new construction."
5,Probably for collectors only...,"So, you got a whole bunch of U2 crap and you feel you need a little bit more? That was my case aswell. This little baby is from Japan, and boy is it cool. The CD is about 3 inches in diameter and all it has on it is Sweetest Thing and With or Without You. But it sure does look great in my CD book. Then again, I am a little biased toward Japanese packaging design."
2,Mainly for Julie Andrews fans.,"This production is okay, but it could have been better.A decent cast, but too much material is given to Julie Andrews, who is well past her prime. Attempts are made at a plot-thread, and these fall flat. Includes some material not readily available elsewhere.I am a great fan of Sondheim's music, but I really do not enjoy listening to this set at all. For an introduction to the music of this marvelous composer, try ""Side by Side by Sondheim"" instead; much better."
2,Yuck! Go buy the individual albums!,"Until the 2000 revival album comes out (cross your fingers...) just go out and buy the original cast albums. This was a big disappointment for me. As other reviewers have pointed out, Rachel York steals the show while the rest of the ensemble is mediocre or worse. Julie Andrews has got a great voice, but she should stick to Richard Rodgers songs. The orchestrations are horrific (the instrumental openings to 'Rich and Happy' and 'Merrily We Roll Along' are awful--and what's more, they occur more than once!). Also, I detest any revue that changes the lyrics of the original songs, and this revue does that a lot. Further, this review neglects arguably the two best songs in Merrily--Not a Day Goes By, and Good Thing Going. Until the superior 2000 cast recording comes out, steer clear of this revue. Even Rachel York can't save this album."
3,Pleasant Sondheim,"Lovely Sondheim revue, stitched together with a frothy (and illogical) plot, it doesn't matter, it gives a group of varied and capable performers (Christopher Durang excepted, slightly out of place, stick to writing Chris) an oppurtunity to deliver some great Sondheim. Julie Andrews return to the NY stage is delightful, no longer prim Mary Poppins, she even tosses out the ""F"" word.That aside, it's a sophisticated melange of SS music.Skip the revival that went to Broadway, despite an admirable cast, it doesn't come together. Carol Burnett and company give it their all, but the magic is missing. DON'T by the dvd."
4,Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection,"Very entertaining when you need to sit and not get involved in a deep drama or action film. It's perfect when you've had a challenging week, and you just want to sit back and laugh at really silly stuff."
3,Not as good as the Buffyverse academic books,"Not a terrible book. Just not as good as the Buffyverse readers -- I was looking for more ethics oriented material, but at least there IS an Angel reader. Still haven't read all of it, but it's worth if if you are an Angel fanatic and want something besides fanfic."
1,The original versions are much better,This album is terrible. The original songs are much better. The only song that even sounds any good remixed is Please Don't Go. But the original version of that is much better too. I would recommend The Best Of KC & The Sunshine Band instead. That is much better since it isn't all a bunch of cheap remixes.
4,Teaching the basics,This is good for teaching the basics. My daughter learned the first few songs very quickly.This is good for teaching without an instructor.
1,Difficult to understand,This book is not for beginners. I thought I could help teach my 6 year old to play a keyboard but I have no experience either and this book hasn't helped me.
5,Great little book for little children,"My kid's teacher used this booklet as a startup point for his piano lessons.It is very easy to read, progress gradually and with very cute cartoon decorations.Despite being technically simple, the pieces are very well arranged, so the young pianist can feel he is playing ""real"" pieces even at a very early stage.Overall a good complement to the weekly piano lessons. Worked fine for my 5 1/2 years old, and would probably be fine for most 4-7 years old."
4,Teaching Little Fingers to Play: A Book for the Earliest Beginner (John Thompsons),Pros:A very good lesson book for beginner's piano.Cons:None.
3,Okay for the first draft!,"I think it has the makings of a good handbook. However, I think the author should have had it reviewed by his RF colleagues. Being no RF expert, I was able to pick out several obvious mistakes. A few gems: Pg. 64, ""Velocity factor (v) of 0.80, which means that the wave propagates along the line at 8 - 10 the speed of light"". Pg 284, Hot S22 Methods, Lists all the S parameter formulas but leaves out S22.Several times in the book, Joseph Carr tries to point out the significance of the Third-order intercept point with variations of the same graph along with variations of the same description. I would rather have settled for one in depth explanation. By the way Joseph, just how do you come up with the straight-line equation for the 3rd Order Response?There were some good examples on plots using the Smith Charts. However, the graphs were barely legible."
4,"Good Handbook, Light Design Info,, solid reference material","Good GENERAL test guidance throughout, with handy formula to tie you back into the theory of what is actually happening. Although there are some of Joe Carr's books I don't like, this is one I definately do and highly recommend for anyone involved in the testing of RF devices, especially those which have to test and work with a diverse product set.For more in depth circuit analysis, see Chris Bowicks ""RF Circuit Design"" or for more basic info, check out Jon Hagen's ""RF Electronics"". If you need PCB guidance, head over to Tim Williams ""The Circuit Designers Companion"" and if you need more magnetic or HAM type info definately get Jerry Sevicks ""Transmission Line Transformers""."
1,Ripped off,This is a cheap overpriced imitation of a real nose hair trimmer. I would not give this to my mother-in-law. You could probably purchase this quality of item at a flea market for 5 or 10 bucks. The seller overstates the virtues (facts) of the product. Save your money and buy from a dealer that you know and trust.
5,great spoon/recipe holder,This gadget is great. I had to purchase a second one because my first one is hanging on my cupboard door nob with recipes clipped in it. Perfect eye level and I just flip to read the back of recipe card. Oh by the way it holds the spoons great on the side of the pan too. :-)I added a photo of it hanging with recipes.
3,no instep support,"These are my third pair of Minetonka moccasins. I had hoped/expected that with the double bottom hardsole described in the product title and the raised heal visible in the photo that this style would have more instep support that my previous Minetonkas, but that is not the case. Therefore, I can only wear them part time and cannot walk long distances in them. Well made from good materials, as one would expect."
1,Minnetonka quality control.,"These slippers are a small fit and need considerable breaking in. They are not warm and to top it off I had to return them as the sole came away from the shoe upper.Extremely dissapointing as I will be out of pocket due to the cost of return post from Australia.Amazon will pay ""UP TO"" $4.98...for the return freight, but it cost me $44 in freight to return them, plus the$22 plus to send them in the first place.Very expensive pair of slippers which fell to bits and I had to pay.Hardly seems fair, I thought Minnetonka was a quality product. I was mistaken."
3,El Tejedor De Sueños Musicales:,"Si tratamos de encontrar a un tejedor de sueños, podemos hablar de Gary Wright quien crea cada nuevo sueño mediante el uso de sus teclados, amigo de grandes como George Harrison, pero desconcido para muchos en el mundo. Nos encontramos frente al recopilatorio ideal de este artista, ya que, se incluyen por primera vez juntos temas como Dream Weaver, Love is Alive (los cuales llegaron al #2 de los rankings) y uno de los no encontrados en CD en la actulidad Really Wanna Know You (un bonita balada que mezcla la voz y los teclado de Gary, pero solo llego al #16). Si eres amante de la musica de los 70s y quieres conocer a un vanguardista de fines de esta decada te invito a que escuches este CD"
2,Not junk food,"Ok, I love mac&cheese in the blue box. This one is not at all like that. I'm thinking it is because it has less saltiness. Not cheesy enough for me but its handy for lunch."
4,After a long search...,"...I finally found this CD. As with most of Martin's music, it's drawn from personal experiences. I'm more impressed with his singing and lyrics than with his songwriting, but this CD is excellent nonetheless. Hard to pick out any weak tracks, although 'Glory Bound' is definitely the highlight."
4,As seen on Scrubs,The song Diner from the Black Sheep album is a great song. Makes you want to get up and bust some moves. The rest of the album is...kinda not so great.
5,A incrediable cd,"Martin Sexton is by far one of the best songwriters I have listened to in a long time. He mixes his real-life expereinces with incrediable melodies. My favorite tracks on the cd are ""Blacksheep"", ""Glorybound"", and ""Can't Stop Thinking 'Bout You"". I also highly recommend seeing him live in concert if he is coming to a town near you. You will not be disapointed!!"
3,A Lttile Too Slick For Me,"He is a talented singer/song writer, but it is not my cup of tea. I prefer a rougher edge or meaning to the lyrics."
5,folk anyone?,"hello! i bought this albumn and was blown away. acoustic guitar driven folk that makes me weep, laugh, and chill all at once. if you don't believe me, just find some of his music and give it a try.from the slow, emotive ""glory bound"" to the more jazzy ""can't stop thinkin bout you"" sexton takes the guitar in hand and picks, plucks, and strums his way through eleven tracks of sheer bliss. many of his topics are darker (such as the needy lover in ""candy"") but he still pulls out a light song now and then.if you are looking for neo-folk with an edge, give martin sexton a listen."
5,!,this cd is great if u would like to hear great guitar work and alot of good solos i suggest this cd to anyone.
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed that it quit working in the first week. I was replacing the same one that I'd had for years and only replaced it because the lid was damaged.
3,Fragile,I broke the first one just by using it...ashes collect around the batteries under the tray...keep it clean...not liquid cleaner. I bought a second because it works well.
3,Not Really Satisfied!,"I am not a smoker and I ordered this to help with the smoke of friends who were visiting. I have to say that it only cut down on the smoke slightly! Disappointed in that! I know people who smoke have an addiction, but if they have any intelligence, they should want to quit! They should also make something to make the smoke disappear completely!Thank You"
4,ashtray.,"It doing the job that I want it to do, But i think I will be looking for something else also. I really do not have any complaint about this product. But I will be looking at your other product."
2,Smokeless Ashtray,I did not like this product. The base is not DEEP enough. I burned a rug two times.
1,Doesn't last very long,"After using for a couple weeks, the motor went out. Now I have oversized ashtray in the house with no purpose."
2,Not an impressive start-Pink Floyd wannabe's.,"This is Tangerine Dream's first album. It is only 36 minutes long. Sound quality and mix are not very good.About half of this album is just noise, with the band members just clanking on stuff or making eerie sounds. Much of it sounds like one of those Halloween albums of spooky sounds.The other half is some interesting coherent music, with some interesting trade offs between organ, guitar and drums. The music is really harsh, churning and metallic. But, the whole thing sounds like a rip-off of earlier Pink Floyd music, specifcially Saucer Full of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma. (Atom Heart Mother and this album came out at about the same time, but Pink Floyd had been playing variations on Atom Heart Mother for about 2 years).This album is nothing like later Tangerine Dream album, where they would soften their sound and move towards more electonica and ambient."
4,Pillars of Destiny,"So nice to see a clear/concise book focusing on Pillars of Destiny school of Feng Shui. The market is flooded with Black ""Hat"" Sect books, if you are interested in discovering your own personal element this book is invaluable. The book consists largely of charts, though there are a few interesting case studies. My two largest complaints are: that the charts only go back 1936 (this is a large problem since there are plenty of 65-70+ year olds whom I am sure would like to find their own birthdate!!) and I would like to see more suggestions on how to incorporate this information in our daily lives as well as in combination with other Feng shui schools."
2,Doesn't smell right,The scent smells old or spoiled. This has always been the perfume my husband likes me to wear and he also said it doesn't smell right.
1,Rancid White Shoulders Cologne,"I have always trusted Amazon to send me the best products so I was shocked to find that the cologne I purchased is rancid - it smells like chemicals (and not good Ones). There should be expiration dates on these products as this one must have expired a long time ago. Now I find I am unable to send it back because it is potentially hazardous or flammable. It seemed to be fine when Amazon mailed it to me but now it's dangerous for me to send it back. Since I didn't open the package for a week, I am past the ""time limit"" to get a refund. I never thought that I would need to smell the cologne right away in case they sent one that was rancid. I guess I better check everything as soon as I get it. In the mean time I have thrown $21 down the drain and will do my shopping for cologne elsewhere."
2,No it isn't,"I'm a BIG Eddie Harris fan. This is by no means the best of Eddie Harris. There are a couple of good cuts (basically, the first 3 or 4) and the rest represent meanderings by misguded producers and squander Harris' immense talent.There are other compiations of Harris that are better. Any album claiming to be the best of Eddie Harris would have to have Exodus and SOMETHING from Swiss Movement.Buy Swiss Movement instead (the version with the bonus track) and then get the Artists's Choice CD, which is much more representative of Harris' skills."
2,Beyond Dreams,Don't bother with this one. David is not at his best. Lounge music at best. Does not have the excitement and rythm of his Beautiful Day works.
2,Not a very good deal,"I purchased this DVD a while ago, and regret doing so. While there are some helpful tips and tricks you can learn about each subject, there is not enough content to get your money's worth. It's only 90 minuets, which is not long at all for paying about $100. Before I bought it, I thought ""How could they teach you alot about shooting, lighting, and sound in an hour and a half?"". Turns out that my assumption was correct. To sum it up: You get no bang for your buck."
3,Cheaply made,I ordered 3 necklaces from this seller. One was too ugly to give to anyone. This one is not as pretty as it looks in the picture. It is obviously cheaply made - but I should have expected that because it is only $4.99. But this one does have prettier beads and I can give it as a gift. Just know when you are ordering that they are $4.99 for a reason. It was shipped very quickly. So no problems there.
4,Irene Zutell knows Hollywood,"This book was far better than most chick lit,funny,smart & you can tell Zutell understands Hollywood politics.Most books about LA are just so predictable this book kept me interested & there was more to it it than I expected. Definitly a step up from most books in this genre!!!!"
4,A brilliant collaboration,"Actually, I rate it 4.5 stars.I am an avid music lover of many genres. The entire CD is good, which is a rarity. All the tracks are beautifully orchestrated. The music is upbeat, melodic, rhythmic. No boring tracks. You won't be disappointed."
3,Small Budgeted Scary movie,"A scary movie (well, maybe not much scary for nowadays' standars) with more Horror-movie interesting elements (Sects, menaced woman-alone, etc) than results.If directed by someone more accomplished, it could have been a cult-classic. As it is, it's only a curiosity (Though It think than worse things are cult-classics!).Though a ""Cheapie"", it stars a once Oscar-nominated name, Jeanne Crain -in her probably latter-day, most protagonist role.To finish: What an intriguing title!"
4,Cute Little Salt n Pepper Shakers,"Although I love the size and design of these shakers, I was a bit disappointed that they aren't as ""scarlet"" as the other Fiesta scarlet pieces. I'm not sure if that's just a fluke or not. Also, it was very, very difficult to get the stoppers out of the bottom to fill them with salt and pepper. Though these stoppers do need to fit snugly, I nearly tore off the edge of it trying to dislodge it from the shaker and my fingers took a beating too. All in all, since I won't need to fill them very often, I am pleased with this purchase."
4,"Bright, cheery and nice touch to kitchen","I recently became a Fiesta fan. These salt and pepper shakers were one of my most recent additions. I love them! They are a bit cumbersome for small children to handle, otherwise I have no complaints. I own the scarlet set and love to look at them on top of my stove. They add a great punch of color to my kitchen!"
1,Clogging S&P,"I have the 2 1/4"" size. I had to grind the salt and pepper so it would shake out. Then if there is the least amount of moisture on the food, it will clog. I just purchased the large size, which is marked ""S"" and ""P"", unlike the small ones."
4,Traning Exotic,"The opening bars of ""Olé"" begin a slow, sometimes hypnotic journey through Iberia with Trane as conductor. On soprano sax, he weaves Moorish lines while Eric Dolphy adds an unusual wrinkle, a flute solo that avoids that instrument's usual hippy dippy tweeness. Freddie Hubbard adds to the Spanish feel with his trumpet, and then like two groaning sages, the bass players speak to one another in an obscure, mysterious language. ""Olé"" has all the yearning of Coltrane's best music. ""Aisha"", on the other hand, though written by pianist McCoy Tyner, speaks to his gentleness, his celebration of beauty. Inspired no doubt by a soulful woman, the ballad is reminiscent of Trane's ""Naima"". On the whole, it's a reflective and restrained album that only gives the slightest intimation of the volcanic intensity that would soon follow."
4,Where Is The Coltrane Legacy CD?,"For me, the highlight of this ""Ole Coltrane"" CD is the bonus track, ""To Her Ladyship"", composed by Billy Frazier.It's such a beautiful tune and John Coltrane's playing on it is so haunting, although Eric Dolphy's flute solo steals the show.I just wish the original album from which it came, ""The Coltrane Legacy"", were available on CD."
2,"Cute, but Poor Quality","The belly ring was very cute and looked great, but it was poorly made and broke within a few days."
3,"It's a good deal, but the specs are a bit exagerrated","It's a good deal, but the mfr claim is a little overstated: ""The DW990 is the industry's most powerful 14.4-volt drill, delivering 334 in./lbs. of torque"". Maybe true at one time, but not now. See the comparable Porter Cable 14.4-volt Model #9878, it's 360 in-lb, and for a few more bucks the Milwaukee #0516-22, at 390."
4,Enjoyable movie,"I've had this movie for about 10 yrs on VHS. It's a nice little movie and I have enjoyed watching it. Barbara Mandrell does a pretty good job for her first movie. Wasn't really impressed with Tom Wopat's performance, actually some of the supporting cast is more impressive than the lead actors.All in all, I enjoy watching it.I'm not sure that the picture on the front of the DVD case is actually Barbara, they should have used the artwork from the VHS version."
4,No problems,"I've had the Rio player for about a month, and I have no complaints as of yet. 256MB has more than enough room for what I need in the gym for a workout, and it's USB connections and software make adding/deleting songs really simple. The menu options could be improved upon, but a minor gripe really. Overall, a great piece of equipment for the price."
4,rio player,"Good player controls could be a little bigger and it could stay in the holder a little tighter. Other than that very pleased with quality of music, amount of time on one battery. Overall good, no problems."
3,Rio Forge 256 MB MP3 Player,"For $39 dollars this was an ok buy. I've had problems with the player cutting off quite quickly ( once it went dead for about 10 mins). I use rechargable batteries and am thinking that the indicator may not be all that accurate when using these. I've have changed the setting under power to NIMH, so i know that isnt the problem. Still I'm parnoid about having a spare battery with me at all times. When charged the player works very well, and to be honest I just like the way thing looks, so I'll kept it and leave my fingers crossed."
4,Good Mouse for Mac G5 Running Tiger,"This is a no frills workhorse that tracks accurately and has no issues with OS 10/Tiger. It would have received a 5, but the scroll wheel does not navigate left and right, like the Microsoft Intellipoint mouse it replaced.On a side note, Antonline's return policy is terrible. This is one of a few purchases that convinced me to only place an order when it's fulfilled by Amazon."
4,"Doesn't work on my ""optical"" mousepad.","I have to use it on my desk, (no mousepad). It can get noisy when playing video games with all the clunking on the desk.Other than that it is very smooth and precise. Love all the buttons."
5,Oh my God...,"This cd is the best!!! It helps me fall asleep and is soooo relaxing, I fell asleep at work! The vocals in the cd are so moving and calm and relaxing. I enjoyed this cd soooo much and I bet you will too."
5,Red In The Land Of Harold,"The small indie Collectables label has rescued another jazz gem from the vaults at Atlantic Records. ""Hear Ye!"" is the 1961 ""debut"" recording from the Red Mitchell-Harold Land Quintet, yet both the bassist and tenor saxophonist were seasoned veterans of the recording studio independently. The album also features pianist Frank Strazzeri, drummer Leon Petties and the brilliant, under-recognized trumpeter Carmell Jones, who made invaluable contributions to the classic albums ""The Blues Book"" by Booker Ervin and ""Song For My Father"" by Horace Silver. The disc's eight tracks consist of six originals -- two by Land (the disc's best in my opinion), two by Mitchell (including the spirited title track), and one each by Jones and Strazzeri -- and two standards. While ""Hear Ye!"" may not quite rank up there with Land'sThe FoxorWest Coast Blues!(see my reviews), it is a remarkable session and a joy to have available again."
4,Solid Indie Filmmaking,"My Pure Joy is a great film to watch if you dig indie horror. I dug the buildup in certain scenes, especially the dinner scene and the journal reading. The prosthetics were well done (one more graphic than the others =/, buyer beware haha) and overall a pretty sweet project. The flashbacks to the dad were a highlight as well."
2,"I had high hopes, but was let down","This movie was okay for something that should of went straight to a youtube channel or something, but it seemed so low budget that it was only worth, hearing the real classics listed by the character in the movie, just by saying classic slasher films does not make you a classic slasher film."
4,Awesomeness!,"While a lot of the other reviews mention this is a low-budget film, it does one thing a bunch of low-budget films lack, and that's use every penny to it's potential.If you're debating on watching this movie, I'd say go in watching it with an open mind. Special fx aren't grade A but with that, they aren't over done either.A lot of horror flicks are to be psychologically disturbing and if you watch this film as a true horror/gore fan, you'll get what you wanted :)."
3,Does Mr. Mayer have editors??,"So far I have very much enjoyed the Atlantis series. This book, however, is driving me nuts! So many inconsistencies from the previous books. Dane and RT Kansas went after a downed U2? Wow, an SR-71 morphed. Japanese samurai from the 4th century? Just the book before it was the 13th century. I read along and mentally strike out things and fill in the blanks. It is just sad.This is just the tip of the iceberg though when you start looking at all the wrong words used in all of the books so far. The words are not misspelled, they are simply the wrong word in a sentence and if taken literally, instead of as a typo, the sentence makes no sense.So I have to ask, does Mr. Mayer have a REAL editor? If he is acting as his own editor (a mistake for any writer I think) then he does a poor job and should be ashamed. If he is relying on others he should be ashamed that he is not double checking their work."
2,Proof read please!,"I've read many of Bob Mayer's books before and enjoyed them. I am half way through the Gate series and it's a good read BUT the proof reading is non-existent and it effects the readability of the text greatly in some places. I don't know if it's Mr. mayer's, fault or Amazon's bit it's not acceptable. It's so bad on occasions that it takes 3-4 read throughs to understand what's actually being written. I don't care that this is an ebook format, no-one paying for a book should have to accept that poor level of quality. You certainly wouldn't with a printed copy. Proof read before publishing please!"
2,A overly simplistic view of the Battle of Thermopylae,"Bradford is an amateur historian at best, and his work, although well written, lacks true historical merit. In last the few years, the narrative of the battle of Thermopylae has come under some scholarly scrutiny, especially concerning topographic issues. Nevertheless, Bradford's work is suitable for those who only have a passing interest and is not designed for students or historians of antiquity. A better study on Sparta would be by Jones, or Lazenby-- whose work focuses primarily on the Spartan Army. See also Pritchett for a more detailed analysis of the Greek state at War. Again, this book is not for specialists, that is those interested in actual historiography, but for the arm-chair historian.Jason Governale. University of Chicago. BA UCLA 98"
1,Manhattan Merry Go Round,"I have a VHS of this movies which I purchased years ago. The quality of the VHS is much better than this snowy DVD. I expected an improvement from my VHS of this movie. Instead, this DVD looks like a very poor copy of a snowy VHS recording. I'll thing twice before purchasing any recodings from this company."
3,"Nice looking, but lesser quality than expected.","These are nice looking utensils. They are 18/10 stainless steel and Henckels so presumably do not stain like lesser quality ones. However, I've noted that they do show staining sometimes. I'm theorizing that these might have say... 9 percent nickel so not 10/8 anymore, but called 18/10??* 18/0 would mean 18 percent chromium and 0 percent nickel* 18/8 indicates 18 percent chromium & 8 percent nickel* 18/10 indicates 18 percent chromium & 10 percent nickelThey are also much lighter (weight) and feel than I expected. My old set which were 18/10 and smaller in size were heftier per piece. Bought these to have a large and complete set and liked the style. Assumed that the 18/10 would mean a nice solid piece of metal.I still like these, but a little disappointed and next time will go to the store to get the touch and feel first before buying online."
4,"Good, but could be better","I like Gold Fibre because it has a wonderful writing surface (very smooth) and because it is thick. It writes fantastic if you have a fountain pen, and doesn't get wrinkled and crappy-looking. This paper manages that fine, but it has some garish colors to it - the yellow is a horrible kind of canary and the lines are thick blue and tri-lined bright pink, detracting from the otherwise high quality of the paper. I really liked some orangish-gold paper I found in Staples once, but there appears to be no mention of its existence anywhere online under the Gold Fibre name. I thought this was the one I wanted, but I was wrong. I'll have to put up with it until I can find my lovely stuff again."
3,Skabubbly,"I've been familiar with Roddy's recorded output for 30 years and loved his style and enthusiasm. This is just not true to Rockabilly, and before I'm condemned let me explain why. This appears throughout as an attempt to gain airplay. For someone with such knowledge of the genre and musical talent it's beyond me how this turned out to be a superficial and lightweight product. It has little to do with Ska and little more to do with Rockabilly. It's not bad, just disappointing."
1,Do not be fooled!,"The ingredient list they have here is not correct. This shampoo is by no means all natural or herbal: Sodium Laureth Sulfate and alcohol are listed as the main ingredients, with olive oil and coconut oil being at the bottom of the list (unlike their listing which puts the olive oil at the top). It is nothing but regular shampoo. The way it is listed gave me the impression that I was getting an oil based shampoo that would moisturize my hair. I wouldn't buy any of these products."
2,Only half of the soundtrack album,"I should have been more careful. This mp3 download of the album has only 20 of the 41 songs, and not my favorites."
1,Ummm,"Wow i'm so unimpressed with the new album. I loved the first one so I didnt really bother to listen to the songs on the new cd cause I knew I liked the band. But I don't know what happened. I know most bands ""grow up"" or whatever but why ruin a good thing *cough* Thrice *cough*? I haven't even opened the cd because I plan on returning it for something good. Like someone else said, you have lost a fan."
5,Nebraska's history in pictures,"An oversized, very handsomely illustrated history of Nebraska. There is some text, but the emphasis is on the photographs depicting various time periods in the state's development. There are 5 major sections: before statehood, the fledgling state, the emergence of modern Nebraska (1890-1930), drought and war (1930-1970), and the most recent technological era (1970-present). The photos are far-ranging and include famous people, forts, Native Americans, early town and city growth, natural formations, Dust Bowl scenes, cowboy and farm life, and the most recent developments. It's a fun book to look at and would grace anyone's coffeetable, Cornhusker or otherwise."
3,Lotsa nice pictures....,"...but if you're looking for a decent history of reggae and reggae artists, this is NOT the place to start. Best to start with the ROUGH GUIDE TO REGGAE or Lloyd Bradley's THIS IS REGGAE MUSIC."
5,excellent history of jamacian music,"I LOVED THE INFORMATIVE INFO ON JAMAICAN MUSIC. THE BOOK IS A EXCELLENT READ,ALSO THERE ARE SOME VERY BEATIFUL PICTURES. ANYONE WHO ENJOYS JAMAICA, WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK. IT IS A COFFEE TABLE BOOK, FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!ONE LOVE NYIAH"
5,Cotton Candy and Peanuts anyone?,"D'you ever wonder where all the stars of Burlesque went during the hot summer months before air conditioned theaters? Well, they went on the road in carnival shows, and this is the story of that world. This is a lovely, delightful, very informative book!I was enthralled by the stories of these plucky men and women who travelled across the country bumpin and grindin. This is a great book to read after watching ""The Greatest Show On Earth"". I especially enjoyed the sections on Burlesque performers, and the chapter on ""Hooch"" dancers was interesting too (kinda gives you some insight on why Vera Ellen was so horrified to be discovered as a hooch dancer by Gene Kelly in ""On the Town""!) This book is an absolute must buy/must read!!!"
5,Always a fan of Bertrice Small,"Great read, stayed on track and interesting as Bertrice Small always does. However, I am partial to all her books. I have waited a long time to read Love Wild and Fair and I was not disappointed. If you enjoy Ms. Small's books and haven't read this one, it is a lovely story with all you expect from this author."
5,Somewhere In Time,"I relive every minute of that beautiful love story of ""Somewhere In Time"" each time I listen to the CD. I go back in time with the character and fall in love with their love story. This music is passionate, compelling and reaches down to the listener's soul. Don't plan on doing anything else while this is playing...you won't be able to, this music captures your full attention. Buy it!!Lea Matthews"
2,Buyer beware...,"There are better versions of this music out there. Although the music is good, it is too choppy. The end of one song and the beginning of the next do not flow. It kind of remindes me of a poorly recorded 70s mixed tape."
2,Dragged Out,I am reading this story....and I find I forgot what I read....she drags out alot of situations in the book....and does not hold my interest....I thought when I read the back of the book...it would be great....but alas for me its not. I am going to continue to read this book since I spent 18.00 on it...I hope it gets better...or it was a waste of my time and money.
4,Fly Away to Great Read,"This is a great read. Timely now as it was in its historical 60s setting. Racism is now as it was then abundantly present in our political society. This book is a ""not-to-miss"" read. An important contribution to the literary dialogue between blacks and white AND women and men."
2,Boring ... sorry I wasted my time,I kept waiting for something to happen ... something to draw me in ... but it all came up short and oh so predictable. A waste of time and money.
4,"Warm , Engaging and Real","I enjoyed this book. It was one of those books that you look forward to reading; one where you miss the characters when you're not reading about them. It was moving, funny and lovely. Weiner has a talent for creating rich characters and believable story-lines.I would recommend sitting with this book and a hot cup of tea/coffee.Enjoy."
1,Didn't even care to finish it.,"Maybe I shouldn't review a book I haven't finished...but I did get about half way through. I kept waiting for something to happen. I kept waiting to like the characters. I was trudging through it when it dawned on me that I didn't have to finish it. There wasn't a single thing I cared to know about in the end. When I put the book down (for good!) I felt a wave of relief.I'll also add that I thoroughly enjoyed some of her other books: Little Earthquakes, In Her Shoes, and Good in Bed."
2,Not easy to connect with the characters,Pretty disappointed in this one. I found it very hard to connect with the characters. None of them are all that likeable. It's sort of a downer book & not very interesting. The 2 stars are generous.
3,Not my Favorite Jennifer Weiner Book,"I've been a fan of Jennifer Weiner's ever since Good in Bed and have read all of her books to date, and I have to say that while I thought the book was okay, it wasn't really one of my favorites. I think Best Friends Forever or In Her Shoes were much better books with more interesting characters and better stories."
3,Okay Movie,"This an okay running movie. There's nothing spectacular here. The only reason I bought is because I'm a runner and I wanted to add it to my collection of running movies. If you're not a runner, I would pass on it. If you're a runner then you might want to take a look at it."
5,Cool Book1,"Penny Marshall-is cool! I love her on Laverne & Shirley, which is my fave show & on Nick-@-Nite on Saturdays. I'm getting the book for Christmas. I like the other cast members of L&S: Cindy Williams, Michael McKean, David L. Lander, Betty Garrett, Phil Foster, & Eddie Mekka-along w/most of the guest stars."
2,Poor camera-work and shadows obscure view,"I was all set to love this video due to the excellent work I had seen in my previous purchase of the ""Mastering Chair Massage"" video but I ended up getting very frustrated with the Integrative Massage - Earth video.The video was set outdoors under the strong sunlight and many times I found that due to the camera-man's position the massage therapist would end up casting her own shadow over her own hands and I couldn't get a good view of her hand/finger position.I wish I could give this video a better review but the strokes being obstructed due to the shadows annoyed me greatly."
3,SO BAD IT'S GOOD,"The plot is pure schmaltz and highly preictable, but the film has gorgeous sexy people in highly erotic situations in it so and that sense it is quality soft core porn.Monique Parent by herself makes the film worth seeing.A club called ""Wild Side"" is the center of the picture; it's a kind of strip/sex club with young things doing lap dancing and other assorted sex activites. The main guy is an aspiring young artist who becomes the hit of the club after he starts performing onstage sex with his girlfriend; they have their problems but all goes well in an enjoyable happy ending."
4,review,"Fantastic product, great service. Item was carefully packed to prevent damage & sent promptly. Would buy from this merchant again. Liked product so much, bought a second copy."
5,Perfect,"This is a wonderful CD in so many ways. If you are not a lover of jazz, this would be a great introduction to the genre. Coltrane is one the greatest jazz musicians of all time and Elvin Jones is arguably in the top two or three greatest jazz drummers. Really a perfect CD."
5,You really need to read this book!,This book is incredibally up lifing and meaningful! I re-read several chapters so the impact and truth of what I was reading could soak in! This is an easy read and tremendously encouraging. I found no fault with Robertson's use of Scripture. This book should not be looked over!
1,How can miracles be mine???,"God is so busy lashing us with hurricanes, terrorists, tsunami's, that I think it would be well near impossible to shower us with miracles. Why would He want to? According to the Rev., God is plenty sore at us. Pat should stick to being God's weatherman/hitman/prophet of doom. That just seems to fit a guy like Pat Robertson so well. Especially when he can grin so well while he's doing it."
5,"God Loves You - Jesus, the Greatest Man Who Ever Lived!","This book is inspiring! This book does a wonderful job showing us what God has done for us, and what he is willing to continue to do for us. As I read this book, I cried tears of joy because I felt God's love for me, but after I was done reading it; it was up to me to keep his love in me. He shows you how God gives us a free will, and based on that will, miracles can happen for you. Many give up on God, but this book does a good job in showing you how He won't give up on you. He loves you and will keep his promise to you, as long as you keep your faith to him."
5,miracles can be yours today,"This book is an amazing piece of factual literature,that isinspirational and a true blessing. This book helped me todevelop a closer relationship with our heavenly father throughour Lord Jesus Christ,and my faith in God has grown so much,Ino longer worry about anything because of the spiritual peacethat I have gained,God bless Pat Robertson for the spiritualeducation he has given us and may he keep up the good work."
4,Nice looking rack for the price,"The product is well worth the price. The first rack I received snapped at the bottom with very little weight on it. Luckily, the company is sending me a replacement free of charge (S&H included)."
1,Poorly made,"The price was cheap, but when I assemble it I realize it is poorly made could not assemble the stand.I usually would not want to leave bad feedback, but think again before order.Hope my comment could help to improve the product......."
4,coat rack,"Nice looking rack. Stability is not so great with heavier coats.Also, it would be great if the top portion swivelled for easy access"
5,GREAT CLOSET SPACE!,This helped me a lot as I am deployed in afghanistan and the rooms are really small here and there is absolutely no room for a closet so i put the rod up in a corner and made a closet space for myself and this rod is very sturdy as well!!!
2,Lesssons in history?,"While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to ""pink"" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere."
1,My Review,"Wonderful photos.........but much, much too technical........and I am an engineer, but most readers, including myself, even with some college level Geology, were hopelessly lost with the technical text. What were you thinking?"
5,The Skeletons of Mrs. Morales: A must have film,"This classic black comedy film, deserved a much better transfer to video. Unfortunately the image quality is poor and blurry. For many years I waited for this video release. Too bad it wasn't done better."
1,Wrong item shown?,"What's going on here? Is this sale for the crankset (shown) or for the derailleur (in the title)? Buyers note: this is not the only wrong image/description for bike parts on Amazon.com, even from reputable sellers."
2,How do you switch off the Ctrl key switching behavior!?,"At first I thought this product was ok. But after some regular hitting of the left Ctrl key as part of my daily work, the switch keeps switching! Does anyone know how to turn off this feature?"
1,A bad choice,"I collect Thunderstorm and surf CDs. This was not a good choice because there is music mixed in with the storm. I didn't like it at all. I want a thunderstorm CD and if I had wanted music with it, I would listen to a storm outside my house while listening to music."
3,It Works But.....,"I bought a 20W bulb for ~2000 gallon pond. It has been running a couple of weeks and the water is clearer, but not clear. Perhaps the bulb included was not up to par. My biggest beef is that the enclosed set up diagram was completely wrong. You will need to attach a 3/4"" fitting on the light housing to the 1"" inside diameter of the 1 1/4"" hose from a typical pond pump. You will need two sets of 3/4"" to 1"" nalgene fittings and two-3/4"" and two-1"" hose clamps."
5,One smooth operator...,"I just got this mouse as a X-Mas present and am very satisfied. I had a cordless mouse made by Mircosoft and was disappointed that it lagged and did not have a smooth motion. The Logitech MX700 is definitely the best mouse I've ever used. It has a variety of internet functions such as easy scrolling and forward/back paging. The mouse glides along almost any mousing surface, but works especially well on a hard surface. The fluid movement, excellent quality, and multiple functions of this mouse make it almost perfect. My one complaint would be of the price, but I assure you that it is definitely worth it."
4,best cordless mouse so far,"Great mouse, I have had it for a week now and although it has a few querks I need to get used to it is great. I noticed a typo on the printed set up sheet that the base station needs to be 20in/8cm away from electronic devices it should read 8in/20cm, about the width of a peice of paper. The set up guide on the install software has it right. I upgraded from a corded intellimouse Explorer. The switch program and scroll buttons are nice. When Im working I have a cluttered desk the cordless mouse is a must. Have not had it long enough to seen any problem with the recargable batteries. If your worried just keep a corded mouse in the file cabnet. I bet you would never need it if you have the habit of docking the mouse when you shut down at the end of the day. Don't forget to plug the mouse docking port into a unswitched plug."
3,Charging was a problem almost from the start,"Like some other people I'm only getting around to a review after about 7 years of steady use.This has been my work mouse and it has seen a very steady stream of use over the last several years. I used it so much I've worn the feet off it and the contacts have been scraped down to the point it won't charge anymore. Actually I've had charging problems with the mouse for the last few years. I've always been able to clean the contacts, or jiggle the mouse, etc and get to to charge again.The mouse itself still works fine but it won't charge even new rechargeable batteries anymore. I'm not complaining too much because I certainly got good service from this mouse. But the whole recharging feature was kinda messed up from the start and that is what finally killed it. I don't even think they sell this mouse new anymore but given the problems I had with recharging I would not recommend buying it used."
5,Greatest Mouse on the Market,"This mouse is great! It is very sleek looking and performs better than my trackball mouse. The buttons are easy to customize, allowing you to assign any to a long list of functions. The batteries last very long, and when you need to recharge them, you just drop the whole mouse in the charging base.If you are thinking of buying this mouse, just get it...you'll be happy you did."
3,Ok,Decent mouse. Very quick response and smooth cursor movement but simply too big and heavy. Buttons are placed in strange locations. The mouse seemed to absorb the sweat off my hand unlike my previous Intellimouse Optical. (Strange comment I know.)
2,"Nice looking, but...","I regret the money I spent in this mouse. Yes, it does have some nice features, but the performance is poor, moreover in high memory-consuming applications, like games. The performance is jerky, and the worst is the scrolling wheel, that is simply uncontrollable. I am replacing a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer (corded) and there is simply no comparison."
1,Cusor problems,"With unit fully charged, the cursor seems to have a mind of it's own. Most of the time it will go where it's suppose to then other times if I move the mouse to the right, the cursor goes to the left. E-mailed Logitech tech support but all I ever got was caned answers. Did the things they suggested, like check distance of mouse to reciever and unit is always put back on charger when not in use so I don't think battery condition has anything to do with it. Overall I would say a trip to the trash can is in order."
2,It's okay.,i bought it for my son and he says it's okay. he says it's not a keeper and that he'll probably trade it in to a used game store.
1,Fight Club should not be a game,The idea of making the movie Fight Club into a game is obscene. Do not buy this product.
1,I really don't like Vivendi now,It disgusts me that they would make a dinky fighter out of such a revolutionary movie.
3,Still fresh after all these years,"It's an ok CD! I found it is good to mix his songs with the rest of my non-Mose collection.This CD will not set the world alight, but it's got a good, light jazz thing going on."
3,Ok if Architecture field or class,Didn't even open this book for my architecture class but if you are an architecture major than this book might be great.
4,Lost History,"Kaplan's lost and found is a great representation of the history of Los Angeles. It shows both pictorally and textally how Los Angeles developed using the medium of architecture. This lends itself really well towards a general history and putting together a timeline of events. The book is separated into chapters of general era in our history. I found that the picture helped me get a mental image of what the city looked like in the different time periods. Overall, the book was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who is researching, or just wanting to see our history in a pictured fashion."
1,They forgot to mention it doesn't work with Windows XP,"The manual states ""The USB diskette drive can be used with either of the following operating systems: Windows 98 and Windows 2000.""The product information says it will work with 'most' systems. That statement was probably true several years ago."
3,Too Complicated?,"Somewhat useful manual. Does dissapoint in the fact that on the issues you might really need help on, the book tells you it is too complicated and to take the car to the dealer. But the book does have some useful information."
1,yikes,"Along with being poorly written, it has SOOOO many errors. A lot of the errors are major errors too. I stopped reading the book when it started telling me that layer 5 was the transport layer.If only they had a single person proof read this, the book might be an okay book."
4,A Second Biography,"While Jamie Buckingham's 'Daughter of Destiny' remains the definitive biography of Miss Kuhlman, this is a valuable collection of interviews and insights that help to better explain Miss Kuhlman's personality and history. Her connection to Aimee Semple McPherson is not as accidental as once thought and her devastating divorce in the 1940's and the collapse of her early success in Colorado was more bitter and scar-filled than even Buckingham (with his brutal honesty) records. Despite claims to the contrary, Warner concludes, like Buckingham, that Miss Kuhlman, not unlike Aimee Semple McPherson, was unique without a direct successor.Daughter of Destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman"
4,For those who dream to build their own,"I have never responded to another's review before, but the one from ""A reader from Warwick, RI USA"" is utter nonsense. Review the book, don't bother us with inane, self-serving blather about new windows and unions. The book provides the reader with the romance and hardship of following a dream to fruition and for that I, for one, could not put it down. Board by board, nail by nail. It is exactly what I, as one who longs to build my own home some day (using old windows, no less), wanted to get out of the book. To quote Willy Wonka, ""We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams."" Thanks to the author for keeping the dream alive."
3,NEEDS PAGE NUMBERS ON KINDLE VERSION!!!!!,"The book has a lot of useful information - if you're reading it, its probably because its required for a graduate class in psychology or counseling.HOWEVER, the Kindle version has no page numbers.Plan ahead accordingly for homework because you won't be able to find your way around the book otherwise."
5,A rare occurence,"Several years ago I bought 2 Laguna 5 utility pumps for my fish ponds. They were amazingly inexpensive and did a bang-up job for many years. I recently moved and installed a new fishpond with a waterfall and attempted to use one of the old pumps. Sadly, it would not run for longer than 60 seconds and nothing I could do would fix it. When I tried to buy a new one, I quickly discovered they are no longer made, and an equivalent Laguna pump now cost over $200. While I was cursing Laguna for their greedy ways and desperately Googling for a reasonable replacement, one of my searches found this impeller assembly. While the description didn't actually list the Laguna 5, it did come up in the search and it looked like the old one. Considering how little it cost as compared to a whole new pump, I figured I'd take a shot. I'm happy to say that it worked like a champ. It's been happily pumping away for about 3 weeks now without a hitch."
4,One of the better Video Calendars,"At 85+ minutes, this is one of the longest Playboy DVDs that I've run across. It's your typical Video Calendar, and your opinion of it will very likely depend on whether or not you are a fan of the particular Playmates featured on it. I found it to have several Playmates who I liked, like Nicole Lenz, Jodi Ann Paterson, and Kristi Cline, and it made me notice a few Playmates I didn't pay much attention to before, like Cara Wakelin and Jennifer Rovero.Each Playmate has a 6 minute video segment, which is longer than the typical 4 minutes in previous Video Calendars. Jodi Ann gets a 9 to 10 minute segment in her spot.Be warned, though, some of the new cases that these Playboy DVDs come in have the notorious flower-pattern hubs that clamp onto the DVD and don't release easily. Be careful when you extract it from the DVD."
1,What is going on here,"Honestely, what is going on herer? How can you transform the amazing deep feeling of the blues into bluegrass. Just because 'Blue' is in the genre of Bluegrass doesn't mean it's the blues. Buy the real SRV CD's not this stuff that has not feeling other than the banjo and dobro guitars. Now to understand my thoughts on this, I am a musician and love all types of good music, including Bluegrass. Bluegrass does not equal the blues, so I suggest that even if you like blueglass, do not buy this cd no matter how good these musicians may be."
5,GREAT SAW!!,"I love milwaukee products,they have been good to me over the years.This saw works great just like I expected!! THANKS FOR GREAT PRODUCTS MILWAUKEE!!!!!"
3,Didn't last long,"I loved this printer from the moment I bought it. It was quick and easy to install and the print quality has been awesome in both color, for photos, and black and white. It printed beautiful, professional quality photos. However, the ink was fairly expensive (but I knew this when I bought it.) Trouble is, after not quite 2 years of ownership, it stopped printing black! It gives a ""replace cartridge"" ""cartridge failed"" error message now and despite trying (and opening) two brand new cartridges nothing works. Repair would be more expensive than buying a new one. I'm very disappointed in the longevity of this product but it was great while it lasted."
4,"Ran a great race, but died in the backstretch","I bought this printer new almost two years ago. Great job on photos, good color, tack sharp images. Last week (while printing a text only job) the ink carriage jammed on the left side of the rail. I had to remove the top of the printer to free it. Ever since then, the printer is a wonderful door stop. Local repair/service types recommend, ""Buy a new printer."" The cost of repair vs. a new printer backs this up. My new Canon i9900 is a dream come true. RIP faithful HP 7350."
2,Printing problems,"Avoid this printer if you plan to print to the 4X6 tray from your PC!I followed the instructions to the letter and still have problems printing to the 4X6 photo tray from a PC. The printing does not match the size of the paper, even though the S/W indicates 4X6. I've wasted a great deal of paper and ink trying to get it to print properly. I do not have this problem when printing directly from the printer via a Compact Flash card. Also, this printer will not feed properly when only a couple of sheets of photo paper are in the 4X6 tray. And when you fill it with paper, it sometimes feeds several sheets at once and jams!!!."
1,"HP Photo 7350, better in the store than your home!","A piece of junk. I have returned mine two times and every one I get keeps telling me the paper is jammed or it can't move the print cradle. (My last HP, the 970 CSE started leaking ink all over my desk as well) I am now going to toss my HP's. I will never buy another one!note: Even one star is to much for this product!"
4,"very messy, make preparations with this toy.","brought this for my five year old twin girls. they love to play with it, they kept stating the slogan, ""that it never dries out"", but it is sooooo messy. you must prepare to play with this as if you are in a sand box, that's what it is sand, and it sticks to thier clothes, and body as sand. the less you prepare for the mess, the more moonsand you will lose to the clean-up. it is fun, and the kids love it, as long as you prepare for the mess and clean-up factors, parents will love it too."
2,extra baggage,"Although I have many Dewalt tools, and like them,the sander does not live up to my expectations. It does as well as any other sander of the same type, but the dust bag is just a protrusion that gets in the way. Dust comes out all around the sander and goes everywhere BUT the dust bag. Also the power cord is a little on the stiff side and always in the way.I have a Makita of the same size that I have used for many years and it serves me much better."
2,So non-new information that I laughed,"Being a fan of Project Runway and a long-time sewer, I was looking forward to learning those ""secrets"" of the world's best designers. Ha! I wish I had thought to write the book because I already knew them all. My mom (not a designer or a professional seamstress) taught my sister and me in the 1950s and 1960s everything that's in the book and what she didn't (the serger stuff) I taught myself. My sister and I laughed ourselves silly at the ""secrets""--bound buttonholes? piping? facings? I do feel sorry for all of the people who want to sew, weren't taught by my mother, and can't read pattern instructions, but for me? What a waste of money."
4,Healing Tree,"Very pretty and delicate-looking (the pendant is the size of an American quarter). It's simple enough that I can wear it every day and far less attention grabbing than my pentacle. The clean lines and artful style, though, make it appropriate for any religion."
1,No tone- wouldn't recommend!,This block has a dull and dead sound- I wouldn'trecommend purchasing it for any serious music..might work well as a toy....
5,Policeman Small,"We give this book to all the Small family babies, they love it and we love giving it to them!"
2,A electronica man,"WTF??? I hate when I read your guy's stellar reviews, go out and buy it and come across complete garbage. I've really tried to listen and discover what a you are raving about...but, alas, i'ts non-existent.This CD is truly garbage...tainted by the worst vocals on many tracks lacking that real dance feel. This is what they play at upsidedown clubs. Some of the ""beats"" get to be slightly catchy as on the beggining of ""You Me"" but either never breaks out to anything better or turns to garbage...fast. Some of it reminds me of Industrial/Techno at times in the begginging...I cant take this anymore....If you like stuff like Sasha/Digweed, Way out West, or even Tiesto...Be careful."
1,Painful,I bought this pump before I asked a lactation consultant to recomend one. It somewhat worked but it was extremely painful. I could express just as much just as fast with the Avent hand pump. I was actually brused from the 'easy comfort' pump!! My lactation consultant said she would not recomend this pump because everyone she knew that used it had a similar experience. I sent it back!
5,Do you want to keep you iPod good as new where ever you go?,Excellent... I use my iPod in the beach without any worries at all no problem with the water or the sand or the wind loaded with salted moisture.. and the price is very right compared to similar products
2,"Cool characters, but dry drab plot","Sheffield's imagination is WAY out on the fringe. The book was definitely unpredictable, but not in an exciting way. I kept reading because I didn't KNOW what was going to happen NOT because I wanted to, but I just had to get it over with.I was very into the plot the first half of the book, because it seemed to have a hard military/sci-fi edge to it. But then the whole nimrod hunt turned into this frilly, spiritual vulcan interspecies mind-meld issue and the characters turned into 2-dimensional victims. Sheffield completely messed up and lost any concept of conflict and resolution and played too much with the intangible themes and too little on making a real gripping story."
3,interesting enough to overcome the lack of plot,"The Mind Pool is a very odd book. For one thing, the story is very obtuse and quite frankly, boring. The two main characters are so similar I found it very difficult to keep track of which was which. And put it all together and it really wasn't that bad. The world in which The Mind Pool is set had enough interesting qualities to overcome the lack of plot. There are enough unique and interesting subplots going on that at times Mind Pool was a real page turner. Clearly Sheffield has some very interesting ideas, but is just not that good at wrapping them up into an actual novel."
2,eh hardware isnt so great,"I recently decided to buy my first mac in that being a macbook because I needed both a new computer as well as a laptop and I wanted to get out of the windows world. The os itself is realy awsome however unfortionently the hardware doesnt seem that great because this new system of apple's seems to be plagued by all sorts of problems namely moo or constant noise from the fan motors reving up and down constantly as well as a wine noise coming from the cpu which i hear is artributed to a problem with the logic board. Mine actualy started off with a small barely audible wine and has since turned into a loud sizzling noise that I can hear over my tv. Not good I'm afraid it might go up in flames shortly so I'm plnaing on returning it and wait untill apple solves all these issues. If you need a notebook now I would sugest you eather buy an older ppc module or get a pc such as a thinkpad, etc."
2,meandering,"I found this book disappointing. The author meanders telling anecdotes about various nasty leaders, but can't seem to get on with an organised discussion of the book's supposed theme:why do people follow these crooks?"
1,JEPECA74,I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN BUT I RECEIVED A BOOK THAT IS WRONG. WHEN I STARTED TO READ IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY.
2,"Light Read, But Not Memorable","This book was interesting, but after reading the Peace Corps novel by Peter Hessler, this one just did not compare.I was not impressed by the style of the writing, the book was organized around journal entries and poems that the author wrote. It just left the book feeling empty and contrived.It seems like the author was most concerned with getting to know herself through her journal entries, which is entirely understandable, as most of us would do the same. However, I just don't think there is enough interesting material about herself to justify my time in a novel.I wanted to get to know the Peace Corps experience and her country better, but feel like I only got to explore her thoughts and feelings rather than a deeper connect with something that would interest a third party.She is definitely a great person and someone that would be great to be friends with, but it is not really worth reading a whole book about her journal entries."
3,Ok read,"Overall the book was good. I didn't like the two to four page ""chapters"" though. At times it seemed like the book was more about the author and her past as opposed to her Peace Corps experiences. But maybe that's what she was going for. Try ""Destination Estonia"" if you enjoy Peace Corps books."
1,unbelievably BAD....unless...,"unless you have only an hour and a half to live...because it will seem like a day watching this horrible waste and you may even not feel so bad about dying!I can't believe just how many people poured their energy into this trash. The story is thin and lame and held together by ridiculous dialog and plot holes large enough to drop a planet through. The acting is second rate ..at best , although given the garbage they have to say Deniro and Pacino would seem bad.Even the cover is a sell job as the actors shown (other than C Thomas Howell) don't really resemble his co-stars. Too bad Rowdy Roddy Piper had such a small part ...more of him would have made it easier to stomach. OH..and David Carradine has the most idiotic and disturbing ""cameo"" part."
5,Lanard Fun Splasher - Splash Rocket,"My kids AND my husband loved this toy! It's just a fun simple toy that can entertain you for a long time and it's fun to see how long the rocket can stay up on top of the water. I really thought my kids (8 & 10) were too old for it, but they love it! It's also nice because it's inexpensive."
4,Better than the Movie,"To anyone considering buying the music of West Side Story, I would strongly recommend the original Broadway Cast over the movie sound track.All the lyrics are the originals, not the censored lyrics that made it to the big screen.More importantly it contains the Somewhere Ballet, a piece of lovely longing music, which was cut from the celluloid version."
4,"The future is here, and it is starting to be evenly distributed","I have to admit I only read this book based on the fact it was topping all the best seller lists. I found it to be a worth while read. Even though I follow technology closely, I wasn't really aware of some of the points that the author made. A good example of this was the fact of just how much the dot com explosion left a lot of cheap bandwidth all around the world. You can then start to imagine how economies, cultures, and societies of emerging countries will begin to change. Many parts of the book I had difficulties relating to, but the new insights it provided were differently worth it."
3,First half good...,"The first half is a good explanation of the forces at work in the modern world and why they are important.The second half has some good points, but he plainly has an ax to grind and he begins grinding it with points that contradict things he has said earlier. So, definitely worthwhile reading for some of the points, but you can stop after the first half. ;-)"
2,"T. Friedman is not what he used to be, or never was.","It s possible to fool all the people all the time. Thomas L. Friedman has proved it. While once he studied relatively small issues in depth, and his poor writing was not as obvious, now he studies the whole wide world. Without depth. With analogies that shift and make little sense. With a tin ear for language and with such energy for such wrong headed or slight notions as to be astounding to this reader. I got through one half of the book and wrote my own review in a local paper. Shame on you all for feeding this man's egomania."
2,It's a slow read,I was not very impressed with this book. The author kept repeating the same points. I only read this it because it was a requirement for a class.
4,had me hooked,i found this book a lot of fun to read and finished it in a couple of days. it really made me think
2,Friedman's Circuitous Expanded Edition,"Having worked with computers since the TI-99/4a, and having been directly involved in IT outsourcing for at least 10+ years, I found much of this book to be self evident. If you are enthralled by globalization and advances in technology and are also a technology layperson, you can probably learn a great deal from this book. For people with deep IT backgrounds, you are likely to find only periodic nuggets (and there are some) of new information while being driven near blind by Friedman's circuitous extended edition."
1,overrated,"Anecdotes and conversations in a preachy, ""smarter-than-thou"" attitude are hardly the means I expect someone to talk to me in. This book is full of generalizations and oversimplifications that can impress people who are not closely involved or educated on the subjects that Friedman talks about.I don't think journalists should talk about subjects they ""think"" they know about. The author has no experience with technologies he refers to...just a bunch of biased anecdotes and conversations supporting his notions.The book was a sore disappointment."
4,Frontrunning the laggers...,"This is a typical US book for 'typical' US readers. For this however it also, although unintentionaly, provides us (Europeans, Asians a.s.) with some good insight into the psyche of the US and how they are finding out about us (the rest of the world). No, Friedman is not a leaper. His book is very retrospective but, at that, he is very up-to-date. He definitively leads the very large group of laggers, and demonstrates very important lessons for coping with the changes that already occured. He learned these lessons and is teaching them, seemingly unaware of the fact that his demonstrated ability to adapt (his) views is probably the most important lesson of this book. At itself the book iks a nice wrap-up of recent history-of-major-changes. Although not explicitely Friedman describes the nonlineair evolving of the future... No, he is not a leaper, but he sure is a very good lagger!"
2,So what?,"Yes it's true we in America are really STYLE over SUBTANCE. Yes, I'm sure the children in China and India are by necessity more academically rigorus. NO we're never gonig to produce the number of math majors and engineers that these countries do and no doubt this imbalance wil continue. And so what if we did? Would there be jobs for them...say if we tripled the out-put of Hard Science grads? Just keep turning the coin in any of the arguements/theories in this book and you'll see that if true it's doom and gloom. I think this book is a lot like Steven Hakings book-it sold millions but how many people really read it, least of all understood it? It's not that anything presented in this book is difficult to understand..my problem is that it's nothing new: ""It's a small world after all""..remember that?"
3,ok,"i dont know, this was pretty interesting but not worth the hype. maybe i missed the point because it didnt explain everything"
4,Unknown and untapped globalization,"Friedman does an excellent job providing a thorough analysis of business (primarily outsourcing), global economic development, and historical political events and their impact on the changing face of global business.Friedman is at his best discussing the advantages of call center operations in Bangalore, India and how companies like Google, Wal-Mart, and UPS has changed business efficiencies.At times the book is a bit too technical and Friedman pushes a political agenda, thus pushing the book 50-75 pages too many. However, this book is a MUST read for anyone pursuing an MBA; works in international business operations; and is looking to identify methods to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies."
5,Excellent book,"Even if you don't know much about technology, this book will open your eyes and show you how the world is flattening day by day and how it is impacting millions of people not only in the United States but all over the world. Definitely a 'Must read'!!"
3,"Great writing, Great pint, Great stories, Too many words","Great writing, Great pint, Great stories, Too many words. Friedman could have written this book in half the pages without losing anything."
3,Interesting Perspective on Globalization,"The premise of this NY Times best seller is that the world's playing field is becoming more and more level. With a PC and a high-speed internet connection anyone can be a player. This has significant ramifications in many facets of life.Tom explains how we got to this point. He also puts some fear into the American reader detailing why we might be left behind in this flat world if we don't get our act together. He offers up some solutions to get back on track.The author also addresses things that have and can continue to derail the flattening, keeping countries from joining the competition.You may not agree with everything in the book, but it does offer an interesting perspective on globalization of which we all should be aware.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper"
3,Too much excitement over a fairly well known topic,"Friedman seems to have discovered globalization late, and it seems to excite him. Some interesting information and overall a good read, but his new vision comes across with a little too much proselytizing. Who found religion?"
3,Interesting but too long - read the summary instead,"This book makes a number of very good points worth absorbing.But you don't need a long book filled with anecdotes of how he came to these conclusions and his meetings with people along the way. It became tedious.The take home value is a bit more than one of his op-eds. But not a full book's worth of value.As an alternative, track down his April 2005 NY Times Magazine article that summarizes it (it's in the archive on their website), or perhaps an abridged audiotape version."
2,Disappointing,"The world is flat, according to Friedman. The world is connected, in normal language. So what? I have read the first 60 pages and then began to skip pages, trying to find something else , but found more and more examples, illustrating the same point again and again. I got the feeling that I am reading the weekly magazine column over and over again.As much as I like Friedman style, the book is way too long for a couple of ideas that he has on the subject. Alternatively, he should have left writing on economics to the professionals. ""Roaring 90's"" by Stiglitz have more ideas in any one chapter, than there are in the whole ""Flat world"". (Well, Stiglitz earned his Nobel prize in economics, so presumably he is better qualified to write economics books)."
2,Too Flat,"Thomas Friedman is an astute columnist, and his columns ring true because he knows the issues that he discusses. Unfortunately, this book is about topics that Friedman admittedly discovered too late and he spends page after page convincing us and perhaps more, himself, that he now gets it. Very little here is new to even the casual technophile; what is interesting is that there is a story connecting the technology. However, that story-telling is marred by an obscene number of references to the term ""flatten"" and its variants. What starts out as a clever book title and metaphor becomes obnoxious after it is pounded to the reader on virtually every page--do a search using one of the new-fangled search devices Freidman has now heard about and you will find thousands of the ""flatten"" words in this book. A ruthless and human editor would have improved this needlessly lengthy book."
5,Challenging World and Cultural Perspective!,"BRAVO! A brave and highly analytical insight into global economic and socio-cultural interaction concerning the prospect of ""future history."" A great read that cooks up quite a bit of what-ifs that challenge business, political and economic players of all levels to re-examin strategies and potential consequences. One must know the past to step into the future."
2,an outstanding book,"While there are some factual errors, ( Netscape did not insure the interoperability of the internet. The IETF did. ) the major disappointment in the book is its failure to point to forces raising substantial barriers to global development. Notably that current corporate owners of Intellectual Properties are trying to impose restrictions on how you or other might use their 'properties' to further innovations and how you may consume music/video you purchased within your own home.Did you know that the length of US Copyright period was doubled in the last half century due to lobbying of companies such as Walt Disney (whose Snow White, etc. owned so much to the public domain) ?"
4,"Good material, good presentation, a couple of annoyances","This review concerned with the presentation on the unabridged CD version, as the content is covered well elsewhere.The reading flows well, and the for the most part, the voice is easy to listen to.There are two annoying aspects of the reading. The first is the author's over repetition of the ""World is Flat"" line. It's a cute line, and it is close to accurate if you look at things from a certain angle, but voiced out loud so many times, it starts to nonsensical. The second is the reader's attempt at Indian accents for quotes of Indians, Chinese accents for quotes of Chinese, a Texas accent for a Texan, and at one point, an attempt at a woman's voice for a woman -- not Monty Python style, but still, a a little funny.Minor annoyances aside, it is a fine recording of a fine book. If you are interested in listening to this type of material, you'll want to listen to this one."
5,Catchy Title,I haven't finished reading it yet but this book has given me much food for thought.Every person who wants some understanding about our present world should read this.
2,How many ways can you say globalization?,"I was expecting great things from Mr. Friedman, but he spent 469 pages basically saying globalization is here --- duh! His thesis is that this opens up great opportunities both for businesses and for terrorists. He seems to have little sympathy for the person displaced by globalization and offers few if any words about ameliorating the plight of those who lose jobs to globalization. He also offers no real course of action to battling the use of globalization by terrorists -- only offering the observation that truly democratic nations with large Muslim populations (e.g., India) seem to spawn many fewer terrorists than non-democratic nations. I was very disappointed that Friedman spent so much time saying what we all know and almost no time exploring how we as nations or individuals should handle the problems as well as the benefits inherent in globalization."
5,Soon To Be Common Knowledge,This should be a textbook. All young people should read thiis book. The author tells you things that you should already know-but don't. If you do not want to buy this book rent it from the library or borrow a copy from a friend. Just make sure you read the book.
2,Better than Ambien,I am struggling to get through this book. Everytime I pick it up I end up falling asleep within 5 mintues. There is a tremendous amount of repetition and story-line is poorly sequenced. Cut out 50% of the words and I think the book would be much better.
2,"Interesting at times, but mostly falls Flat","I can say first of all that this was an engaging and easy read. Friedman is an author of extreme eloquence, and this is a tough book to put down, especially for one on such a weighty issue as globalization.However, he is lacking in convincing analysis. As interesting as his historical perspectives are of industry in the pre-1800, state run era, and in the corporate era of 1800-2000, it is difficult to trust his opinion on the global implications of the last 5 years.Also, too much of the book is devoted to America falling behind, or the education gap between America and other industrialized countries (especially China and India). Not that this topic isn't interesting, but it is somewhat tired, and Friedman brings little more to the table."
2,Yada yada yada,"As an engineer who has been in the midst of the tech-boom/bust, perhaps I'm a little over-informed for this book (but I really don't think so).Aside from obtaining a few interviews from some techie higher-ups, I really don't see where Friedman adds much insight. He makes some very dated and very trite observations (do you know that Burger King saves 5% by using call centers for their drive thru customers?) and is overjoyed in doing so - so overjoyed, in fact, that he is often repetitive."
3,An interesting and thorough look at the impact of the communications revolution.,"A detailed look at the impact of the global communications revolution for an interested novice. The writing ""formula"" is a bit like a techies manual: ""this is what I am going to say, this is how I am going to say it, now I am saying it. These are some examples. Did you understand what I said?"" It is ponderous for someone with but a casual interest in the subject and entirely simlistic, condenscending, and patronizing for a knowledgeable person with a serious interest. Notwithstanding, Mr. Friedman is a keen observer and offers in very simple language a pretty thorough account of the very serious implictions of the global ""shrinkage"" that has resulted from the Tech. revolution."
1,Problem,"Mr. Friedman references Ricardo and Adam Smith and the frequent use of ""free market economics"". The more I read the book the more I am convince Mr. Friedman is a SOCIAL PLANNER. He supports government intervention on one hand and free market economics on the other? I don't like this book because it is ecomically alarmist and does not explore alternative explanations of his ""facts""."
1,Outsource punditry. Now.,"""...I kept chewing on that phrase: ""The playing field is being leveled."" What Nandan is saying, I thought, is that the playing field is being flattened... Flattened? Flattened? My God, he's telling me the world is flat!""Common businesspeak twaddle implies flat planet.The average call center worker in Bangalore can write a better book than this."
2,Obvious and Unimpressive,"Friedman provides some interesting anecdotes to support an incoherent theme. His style of writing focuses on trying to impress the reader with the range and status of people he has met with rather than a viable solution to the problems he presents. Overall, Friedman's conclusions were very obvious and a year late for anyone who keeps up with current affairs."
1,Current bestseller most likely to appear at next summer's garage sales,"No wonder the American media is in such a bad state if this sort of reportage is considered high quality. Friedman's ponderous prose and beltway conventions seek to please both the conservatives and the liberals (another word for them is ""market""). Instead of challenging readers with a fresh, crisp perspective, he ends up serving reheated french fries."
2,Unbearably annoying despite some good ideas & insights,"I'm sorry, but Thomas Friedman is *extremely* annoying. This book made me curse my habitual inability to not finish reading a book once I've started it.There are definitely quality insights and some good ideas - notably the one that reviewer Robert Steele pointed out earlier, about how Bush should have made energy independence his ""moon shot"" - *would've* been brilliant.A previous reviewer notes Friedman's apparently plentiful factual errors, but part of me just doesn't even care if he's right or not because his tone the whole time is so obnoxiously glib. He comes off like the sort of creepy fast-talking know-it-all that you know you can't trust even when you don't know why. I hate to just hurl insults, but my honest impression is that he's basically a mind flatterer for readers (particularly American ones), a corporate apologist, and a CEO groupie."
2,Hello???,"Other authors have been predicting this for over 20 years. Read Gregory MacDonald's Flynn books or almost anything by Spider Robinson.This is simply a discussion of the technology used to connect everyone to everyone. Doesn't address any ideas, issues or predictions.I loved his other books."
4,Social implications of the internet age,"While Friedman is a little pedantic about computers (we get their ramifications) I believe what the true value of the book is captured in its analysis of the social ramifications of a flat world - that you and your children aren't competing against a neighbor for a place at the table but with and against people from all over the world. The fact that he uses the Net and computers as the great ""flatteners"" is ancillary. Worth the read; especially by young people."
2,The book is a chore,"Though the points made by Friedman are appropriate, insightful, and useful...the book he wrote had so many stories that said the same thing to make reading it very difficult. The book was probably twice as long as it needed to be. I felt like reading it was a chore and that I was digging through dirt to find the little gems that were scattered throughout the book."
1,Time for ESL?,"I think that Thomas Friedman should start thinking about his own future in the job market. This book is repetitive, incoherent,poorly edited, and well, just sets up the wrong argument. This is a memoir that is loosely related to reality."
3,Most interesting lesson is how a book like this becomes a best-seller,"Some truly interesting information. Lots of hyperbole. It is some nice fluff, a few intriguing uses of high-speed communitcations supporting silly statements of super-enthusiasm (sorry my illiteration petered out there). Just goes to show people want their fluff - candy bars sell better than spinach."
4,HHMMMM,A different view of Reba-a private performance by Reba and yes this is what it feels like-in your living room Reba entertains and provides the great sounds from her latest album.
5,Thank god for the point,"It was winter (I think) of 71 or 72 and I was 11. I was at home sick with the flu and I saw The Point and loved it. I was a somewhat lonely only child so perhaps I had an inherent set of ideas on conformity which where a large part of The Point's subject. It comforted me during this confusing time and taught me some valuable lessons about always re-examining your ideas and values and the preciousness of a loyal friend (ie. Arrow)among other things. Having seen The Point only the one time its messages have echoed with me to this day. Even now I cant listen to ""Me and my Arrow"" without beaming, or ""Lifeline"" (when Arrow dissappears into the hole) without a tug at the ol' heart.Truly a gentle and unsung masterpiece!"
5,5-8 Set,This has been around since was a child. A wonderful story with music that is upbeat. Me and my arrow. All about the differences of people. You can not go wrong with this CD.
3,"traditional blues, bold and nasty","This is relatively early recordings of sessions from great musicians.The recording techniques are raw (some Mono), but that does add something to the overall atmosphere of the album.Prof Longhair's unique rhythmic style is not fully developed yet, but taken as a true American blues still well worth a listen. The versions of ""Tipitina"" are a stand out."
5,We love it !!,"We purchased this dress for our daughter to wear at our upcoming wedding and I was a little nervous about buying a dress on the internet.When we opened the parcel and looked at the dress we were thrilled.It is perfect.My daughter wanted to put it on straight away!She tried it on and looked like a little princess and she loves it.Our little girl is going to be absolutely gorgeous on our wedding day.Thankyou sooo much. Warm wishes and many thanks from Myself and my little girl. Cheers, Deb x"
5,Charlie Brown Holiday Hits,This CD was excellent! What you can't necessarily tell from the song titles is that it includes almost all the music from each holiday special. For example the Heartburn Waltz is the title song from Be My Valentine Charlie Brown and there is music from the Easter special as well. An excellent choice for all of us that grew up watching those specials. Not to mention it's a great classic jazz CD as well.
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD! RECOMMENDED !!","Purchased two of these lights to install in each of my children's bedroom suite desks. So far, so good! Plenty of light for their needs and space. Installation was pretty easy. I recommend these lights."
5,Awesome~,"This is an awesome product. If you have never read the bible and want to get to know Jesus, or whether you've read the bible from cover to cover, this CD is for you.The words of the new testament were meant to be heard, and the dramatization really brings to life these events and allows them to enter your heart in a meaningful way.Listening to the expressions, gives you a better understanding of what you are hearing.I recommend it for you and all your family members. Its a great gift, that keeps on giving."
4,"great router, just don't upgrade the firmware","when I first got the router, it worked fine. But I, like a moron, decided to upgrade the firmware, believing I should have everything up to date regardless of how well it works at first. Then things started to slow down. I could still download at the same rate as before, but there was a 3 second lag everytime I clicked on a web page link (i use verizon dsl). so i tried to downgrade the firmware, which could not be done per the linksys tech support people, so i sent it back for a new one. this time, i didnt' upgrade the firmware, and everything is back to normal, no lag.the thing gets warm, not too hot. i was scared when i read the reviews that it would melt my desk but thats not the case.all in all i like the router. it does what i need it to do and it was cheap."
2,Low-end router with limited capabilites,"Yes this router is cheap, but it does not function well. The main reason is that it does not support port-forwarding a key element of a router. I called tech support because port-forwarding did not seem to be working on the NR041, and they told me there was a bug that caused this malfunction. To make matters worse, there is no ETA on the patch for this major problem as Network Everywhere is concerned with their wireless products at this point. I sincerely urge people to skip this router and look for a better one."
4,Good Router,"Good Simple On line menu is easy Understand, A must for Plug and Go system if ya need to hook more then one computer at a Time Highly recommended"
5,Great Information,"My chiropractor was the one to recommend this to me when I told him I'm currently pregnant. The information contained in it is very detailed, scientifically accurate. Their explanation of how other cultures have used different methods and positions to give birth safely is fascinating and really does make sense. I love the exercises, they are easy to understand, I've felt a definite improvement in flexibility and less lower back pain."
5,Great Product!,"Okay, years ago I was homeschooling 4 children. The two older children had ""learned""(I do use that term loosely) to read in school. The younger 2 had never been to school. This program was recommended by the local homeschool supply store. We used the full set, skipping past the half books in the Explode the Code series(the half series are really just more repition for those children that need it). Basically, after they learned the letter sounds, most of the rest of the ""teaching"" for them was self taught. They loved using these books. They also start asking the children questions as they progress through the books so you can see not only if they are reading, but are they comprehending what they read. So, really this is NOT just a reading program but it helps children to learn to think about what they are reading. I am returning to purchase this for - yes - grandchildren. I am excited to start this all over again! Really - it is that good!"
5,Brilliant!,"This book series is amazing! I just started homeschooling my 4.5 year old and in less than a week she has solidly learned more about letters and sounds than I have been able to teach her in her whole life doing ordinary alphabet teaching. Each letter is given about 10-12 pages which emphasize phonetic sound as well as the correct manner of writing. The worksheets are fun and very simply laid out which allow distractible preschoolers or kindergarteners to focus for longer periods of time. Other worksheets we have used have been a dizzying blur of cutesy graphics. I definitely recommend the accompanying teacher's guide as it has some very practical tips for teaching phonetics. (I tend to just ""quiz and correct."") For homeschoolers or parents seeking to enrich their children's public education, this series is wonderful!!"
4,enjoyable,"I found this book to enjoyable,easy to read full of lots of information.It was worth the buy."
1,Excedingling disappointing re-hash of Christmases past.,"There's nothing more sad than to me than when artists take a step backwards to reap the benfits of a cash cow. The new Manheim Steamroller is the most diappointing CD I have purchased in a long, long time. If it sounds like the other Manheim Steamroller CDs, that's because it is the same music played with less finesse and recorded with less integrity than the originals. The story that is ungracefully imposed on the music is trite and poorly written. Olivia Newton John and Chip Davis read with a sappy tone that is a real turn off to kids of all ages. If you want good Manheim Christmas, stick with the first two CDs, this just doesn't cut it."
4,The Christmas Angel is...SURPRISE...A Soundtrack!,"Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller's The Christmas Angel has been panned by several reviewers as being a sad rehash or unacknowledged greatest hits album. However, any true fan of Chip and the Steamroller knows that this CD is the soundtrack to a televised ice skating show that aired on NBC back in December of 1998 and will be airing again this December 2000 on NBC (It may even become a Christmas tradition). The music, for the most part, is from previous Christmas recordings, but it has certainly not lost it's magic! The story, narrated by Chip and Olivia Newton-John, is a bit unusual, but makes more sense when watching the ice skating performance. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because most of the music found here is on the other 5-star Christmas releases from Mannheim Steamroller. It's worth having if you're a Chip Davis fan!"
3,O.K.,"I didn't think it was quite so bad. The vocals were kind of bothersome, but the music was great. Every Christmas my family likes to listen to Mannheim Steamroller Christmas music. This CD has some of our favorites."
4,Great Clubs for the Price,Bought these for my 7 year old son. Great combination of clubs available as a left-hand set. Nice carry bag. Very happy with this purchase. Shafts are a little long but in a year they should fit him perfectly. Would definitively buy again.
2,Yuck!,"I usually love Alba, but this just didn't do anything for me...literally. I tried a sponge, wash cloth and loofa. Would not clean/wash. I eventually just tried using my hands and THAT didn't even work. Oh, well. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that I am now using it as a shave cream."
3,Good but not great,"This is my second Acer Laptop. I also have an Aspire 3100. I thought with the Dual Core and 1 Gig memory it would be a lot faster than it is. I guess I need to add another gig. Battery life could be better, but overall I am happy with it. Especially since I have a screaming desktop and just use the lappy occasionally."
1,Awful laptop,"I think it is more interesting watching the grass growing rather than doing your jobs using this laptop. It is so slow, nothing you can do about it. A job that takes 2 minutes to an ordinary pc takes about 20 minutes as it freezes all the time. No to mention the external card input, if you add a firewire device it locks up the internet. I think seriously there should be taken legal action against Acer."
5,Great for little tumblers,"I bought this when my son was just starting to sit up on his own. We have hard wood floors, so I needed something he could tip over on and not bust his little head. We've had it for 2 1/2 years now, and it's held up very well...we use it as the floor for our pop-up tents. When not in use, it folds up pretty nicely and we stash it behind the toy box."
2,Not worth it for every day,"I just got the Canon Selphy CP730 and the best thing that I can say is that it is extremely portable. If you want a picture on the fly, wherever you go then I might consider this. But if you are buying this to use at home like I have, with an eye for toting it about, the print quality is lacking sharpness and the colors are lacking depth. My HP printer does a much better job but lacks the portability. Bottom line, it doesn't produce good pictures."
2,THIS has got to be why Snoop left....,"Okay, here's the deal. Listen to this CD, then use it as coaster. Death Row must have thrown some of his worst tracks together to make this album. Snoop was with them for a while, they should have been able to put together a better album. The first few tracks are decent, but after #6 there is NOTHING of listening quality. I bought this CD because and ONLY because it is Snoop. I've got everything he's put out, and even his ""The Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told"" album off of No Limit is better, and that one was pretty dull. Don't buy unless you are like me, a die hard Snoop fan."
2,Snoop Dogg At Not So Much His Best,"I am a big Snoop Dogg fan but this CD is not the best of Snoop's tracks. Nothing here sounds like the traditional snoop dogg's G Funk track. ""I think if Dre,Battlecat or Soopafly's not producing its not a real Snoop Dogg track. Only exception here is GANGSTA WALK featuring DAZ and Kurupt. The track isnt all that hot but Snoop, Daz and Kurupt all deliver their tight raps. If you want to hear what Tha DoggFather sounds like without Dre's Magic touch check this CD out but your really not missing much."
4,Do Not Buy This,"To be honest I did buy this, but when I found out who I had supported I kicked myself. The songs are great which is why I gave it four stars but do not support Suge Knight!!! Suge Knight is a horrible person and is very likely resonsable for Tupac's death, and to get his hands on peoples hard earned money he whips up stuff like this. Download this because all the songs are great but do not support Suge Knight by buyi ng this or any other money making propaganda his selling."
1,JUST AN EXCUSE FOR SUGE KNIGHT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF SNOOP,"WHOA! I'M SUPRISED BY HOW BAD THIS ALBUM REALLY IS! FIRST OF ALL, THIS ALBUM'S SONGS WERE NOT EVEN NEW 3 YEARS AGO! ALL THIS BASICALLY IS IS A COLLECTION OF OUTTAKES FROM SNOOP'S DEATH ROW YEARS. SONGS LIKE ''TOO BLACK'', ''C-WALKIN'', & ''COUNTY BLUES'' ARE OK, BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS TOTALLY WACK. THIS IS DEFINITELY SNOOP DOGG AT HIS WORST. BUT, WE ALL KNOW WHY THIS ALBUM SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY, JUST SO SUGE KNIGHT CAN MAKE SOME MORE MONEY OFF OF SNOOP DOGG."
1,Do Yourself a Favor...,"On a personal experience, I bought this CD, being a relatively big fan of Snoop Dogg at Best Buy, 15 minutes away from my house. In those 15 minutes, I listened to the disc, not even able to get through one song in its entirety, frequently skipping to the next one. I got into town, disgusted that I wasted fifteen dollars on this. I got home and told my friend about the slopped together CD, and passed it on to him, begging him to take it. The next day he agrees with me - it was the worst CD he ever heard.All of these songs were previously unreleased because Snoop had taste and didn't want to disgust his fans be releasing them. So leave it up to Suge Knight to rip off dedicated Snoop fans. There are no songs worth mentioning on this disc, so do me a favor...DON'T BUY THIS!"
4,One of the best snoop cds,"This has to be one of the best Snoop cd's out their(Next to Doggystyle) all of these songs are amazing and I don't know why Snoop didn't put this out when he was with death row.Hit Rocks is early vision of Bussin' Rocks(Top Dogg). The only bad song on this cd is Too Black (that's why it losins a star), the rest are bangin'. This is definitly worth the money. Westside is back on the MAP!!!"
4,"Not Ideal, but Still Good","I don't know how much say-so Snoop had on this album, but I think he would rather it never came out. That is not to say it's a waste of money. If you're a snoop fan, you'll dig it. It's got some good tracks such as #6 & #8. In the end, it's still Snoop so how bad could it be? Can't wait for Last Meal to come out. Then after that, it's all going to come to head when he reunites with Dre....now that is going to be an instant classic....gar-on-teed!!!"
2,This is an inferior male album,"One member of the feminist org. that I belong to, brought this cd into the coffee room, and played it. We all got mad because it was a male rapper. They should have albums that have female rappers too! The reason because of this, the cd publishers think that we are infeiro to men. Well we will show the cd publishers someday, that we can do the same as men (but better). If the companies are too jealous to publish our cds, we will start our own superior cd company which only women can have jobs. If a female rapped each song on this album it would sound a lot better."
3,Not bad,"The content of this album is probably on a par with 'Tha Doggfather' and the style is very similar. Track 12 is on 'Tha Doggfather', so I don't know what it's doing here. I don't think there was ever any intention to make this a classic album, but it would have made more impact had it been released four or five years ago, when it was recorded. There are some unreleased Snoop tracks on his Death Row greatest hits album which, had they been put on this album instead, would have made it a bit stronger. Neverless, if you enjoyed 'Tha Doggfather', and want more of the same, consider this album. If you only have a few Snoop albums already, don't bother with this, unless you really prefer his earlier style."
5,One of the best accounts of this subject I have ever read!!,"I loved this extremely easy (albeit long) to read book.I marvel at O'brien's skill as a writer, researcher and author.To me it read as a fascinating adventure story and was extremely meaningful. I wish it were still in print."
4,The most intelligent under cabinet lighting ever!,I bought 2 of these Megabrite Slimline Undercabinit lights and they are the best I have ever seen. However I am concerned as the replacement bulbs are difficult to find. One of mine blew and I am looking for a replacement. I plan to contact the company shortly.
1,why buy this when you can buy sony's network adapter,The go-net adapter is a real hassale.Go-net is a cheap product that does'nt work.Go-net only allows you to play older games instead of new ones.So any thing like Socom 2 or need for speed underground will not work with this product and that really (...)!!! (...)
4,Songs for Beginners,"A nostalgic trip back to the 70's when I first bought this album on vinyl, which I still have. Received the album faster than the promised date."
1,A sad from of remix of a beautiful album,"This is NOT the original Graham Nash album from 1971 but a new remix of that album that makes the album completely different. It is very upseting by the record company (or Nash) to do this and still have the same cover, it's close to fraud, I was completely fooled. It's upseting and a very sad thing to do, the genuine atmosphere of good art is gone. Especially the lead vocal by Nash is somehow washed up and now sounds unnatural and to distinct, apart from the overall sound.For Your own good, try to get the earlier CD-edition, it's faithful to the Graham Nash original intentions with the Songs For Beginners and it's quite good CD-production, I've compared to the original LP."
5,Great Recording...Really need remastering though...,"Of the three CNY solo recordings released after the breakup, I think I like this one the best...Really needs remastering though...sound quality not very good."
4,Kids Princess Vanity,"A little smaller than we thought,but it's good daughter loves it,Seller got it to us in a more than timely manner even with the address mess up Very satisfied"
3,One size does not fit all.,"This a cute toy and if your daughters like disney princess you will probably be like me and give in and buy it. From a mom's point of view, I had a few problems with this item. It's not made well, Children over 3 will not be able to fit in it, and it did not keep my childrens intrest for long. I replaced it within 6 months with a talking vanity that they love."
1,Disney should be ashamed to put their name on this one!,"What a piece of junk! We bought this for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas, well we returned it the next day! The lights on the mirror do not work, the whole thing was so flimsey and poorly made. I think that $...iw ay too much for this toy. Do not waste you money on this thing at all! I would go for the Step 2 Barbie vanity, which is wonderful!"
3,"Quick, Steamy, Thin on Plot","This book is purportedly a paranormal romance, but it's really just thinly veiled porn. Don't get me wrong, I like a steamy read as much as anyone, but I do like the sex to make sense in the story, rather than sex be what the story is about.This book had some interesting settings, a studly hero, a likeable heroine, and was very erotic with some light kink. But if you are looking for a real romance story, look elsewhere. On the other hand, next time you're feeling.... you know, a little..... *anxious*... give this one a try."
2,King of Hearts,"So I must say, only 2 points for this one.I must say that I like Alice, so much, an average women, who thinks constant about her size! But Jarron was truly a king, selfish and arrogant. This story is complete Domination and submission, almost no emotions and for me no love. For example, just steering in the eye, doesn't mean love! But somehow, there was a deep connection, related to the trust of Dom/sub connection. Where is the Romantica in a constant training? But on the end, I like, the last part, about King Jarronn and his brothers and the bonding ceremony, weary interesting."
1,Poor quality,This griddle arrived with two major flaws. First the power controller was nearly impossible to take in and out. Second the grease tray did not fit into the grease tray holder groves. I returned it promptly for a refund.
2,No temp scale,Very poor way of attaching the temp scale on the dial. Can't ever tell what temp that is being used. Can't recommend this item.
2,Response time-not good,"I have owned 2 drawing tablets (Wacom and this one). This tablet is very frustrating because at least twice a day the tablet quits responding to clicks. It is fine for drawing but I use it in place of a mouse and become very frustrated when trying to tap with the pen. At least once a week I have to open the pen and turn the battery or change it. The Wacom never did this even though it was about six years old.I will never buy a tablet that uses batteries again.For everyday use, I would recommend purchasing a better tablet."
4,Good Entry Level Tablet,"This is my first tablet - I got it so I could take notes in classes that don't lend themselves to just traditional typing. At first I thought it would be too small, but it's actually plenty big enough for writing on, yet plenty small enough to travel around with my laptop no problem at all. It's very easy to use - after the initial set up, it's just plug-and-play. I've got a lot of use out of it and it's surprisingly easy to write clear, neat notes. Yeah, it's not the best tablet you can get, but for the price it's a great tablet for anyone who just wants a little more flexibility than just a mouse and keyboard."
4,Good gift for those interested in spiritual dance,"I gave this book to my wife as birthday present. I never read it, but she said that it was beneficial. I am not into these types of books."
1,THE BOOK NEVER CAME,I am very dissapointed. The book never arrived. This has damaged my relationship with amazon.com and will make it harder for me to trust the reliability of ordering books online. I'm wondering what can be done to rectify this situation or if my money was just wasted?
4,The African Safari Papers,Very good book if you like black humour. I await his next along with Peter Lefcourt's!
4,Great read and advise,"This book is a great read to brush up on what to expect for an IT interview. If you have been on the job for a while and forgotten what you might encounter on an interview, this should help you out. If you are a newbie grad this will also help you. The last 2 IT jobs I landed were because this book helped me. It didn't hold my hand through the process, but there were some tidbits that did help me. For a few bucks, it was well worth it."
1,"It's not a 2"" cushion","I'm looking for a thinner cushion for my mom. She's currently using 3"" cushion. This is not a 2"" cushion, the measure 2.75"", I would consider this is a 3"" cushion.Other than that, the cushion feels pretty firm. Sorry, buth the deminsion is not I expected."
2,Disappointing Sound - Too Bad,"The materials that make up this disc are for the most part, very poor. I was very excited when I purchased this cd. But even an enthusiastic Krupa fan like me has to draw the line somewhere. Due to the poor sound quality of this disc, I cannot recommend it.GK made many fine recordings during the Verve/Norman Granz 50's period; but the folks at Verve don't believe they can sell enough copies to make it worth their while. If you are looking for good sounding GK from this era look elsewhere."
4,Stunning Flower Photos,"The large pages, with 2 or 3 photos per page, really show off Florida's lush flowers. Many of the flowers come from South America or Africa originally and the book tells the origin of each.A description accompanies each photo telling tidbits about the flower. Example: Night Blooming Jasmine (berries and sap are poisonous), Lantana (is a pest in Hawaii), Pelican Flower (traps insects)... Unfortunately the information is somewhat random, reducing the book's value as a reference source. You will need to look elsewhere for growing information.It is wonderful for browsing and familiarizing yourself with tropical flowers. The photos are large and clear and even include the occasional butterfly or frog."
3,DR. is In,I'm not a real big fan of his music but the man has soul and grit and puts in in his music.
4,Even Project Gutenberg's Version Is Missing Pages,"In reference to Pip's review of 2/7/11 and others that mention missing text near the end, I note that Project Gutenberg's ""read online"" version omits the same text as this version, but that the downloadable Kindle version with images appears to be complete."
3,The Only Available Masnadieri,"Only the frequent and very well-recorded ""Bravi"" make it clear that this set comes from a tape recorder in someone's lap in an expensive orchestra seat. We're a little too close to the orchestra, so the balance isn't ideal: the voices are sometimes unflatteringly recessed. Raimondi offers smooth vocalism and an easy, attractive top. Christoff shines in an out-of-the-way role; Bruson is his subtle, patrician, yet vocally refulgent self; Ligabue, an under-rated singer,is in beautiful voice. Unless you can't stand pirate recordings at all--this is excellent."
4,Wonderful little story!,"The Sarsaparilla Souvenir is was wonderful novel full of beauty, wit and emotion. I loved how Jo Anne Rey combined the true historical events with fiction.A true work of Aussie art. Testament two what the human imagination can accomplish.Some chapters were rather redundant, but still a very nice book! I highly recommend it."
3,A warm account of a young couples' responding to life's challenges despite their handicap,"Excellent narrative. The first half is stronger than the second, which seems to delve into the personalities of the siblings more than is necessary. The book is strongest in its description of the couple as individuals then as newlyweds getting established in a tough environment despite their shared handicap."
2,Boring,"I tried to read this book and gave up after 25 chapters. If there's anything here besides endless description, I missed it."
5,Xmas music,"This is the second cd I bought by Ed Garhard. Great stuff. He gets a pure sound out of playing that I haven't herd in a long time. He doesn't jazz things up or try to throw in a bunch or runs and licks, He just plays. Listing to him make me think that I'm sitting around a bonfire on a snowy day watching someone play a guitar during christmas. I wish I could see his Xmas show live but the cd will work."
3,Beware the softcover edition.,"This was a concise and thoroughly researched book on Oliver Cromwell. I have only one complaint - Antonia Fraser eludes to illustrations that are not present in the book. Either a cost cutting decision or gross incompetence on behalf of the publisher, it is a major distraction. If deciding to purchase this softcover edition, keep that fact in mind."
5,Jerry Flynn: The Underground President,Track Listing:1. Young & Ruthless [3:33]2. Stickin' Hard D!ck [3:24]3. The Bad Mutha 4 Ya [2:33]4. We Can Do This [2:17]5.

2,Not worth your money,"I bought this kind of thin pad night lights a year ago from a different retailer. First of all, the light is very dim, it almost has no effect for a long hall way or big bed room. Both of the lights stopped working under normal usage within 6 months. Once they stopped working, you have to throw them into trashcan, since you can't change the ""bulb"" like the normal lights. Not recommended!"
5,Cook and Learn,"This is a great book for teaching individual portion cooking and I have used it from preschool all the way through elementary grades as so few kids get to handle and mix foods at home. BUT, the price is WAY out of control. A 400% markup from the publisher price seems a bit over the top."
2,There are better ones to buy,"My 3 yr old got this for her birthday. It is durable and it is nice to be able to have two kids using it at the same time. That is if both want to paint or draw on paper. I like that it has clips on both side. Unfortunately we have some complaint with ours. One being that the clips do not hold a single piece of paper, we need to put the whole pad of paper in them. So we use tape to keep the paper on. Another would be the chalk board. I'm not sure why, but our is really hard to write on, so the kids don't use it. Our last problem is that the trays that you put the paints, brushes and crayons in never stay on. They fall off every time they are touched or the easle gets move."
5,Delicious.......,"These sprouts were easy to sprout and delicious. However, do not use their directions. I lost two batches because 4 tbs is too much for a quart mason jar. Maybe they are using a 1/2 gallon jar, they don't say. For a quart jar, 1 tbs is the perfect amount. Takes about 4 - 5 days."
5,the siren of soul!,"as first take left you breathless, begging for more miss roberta flack gave us more indeed.her very soul runs rapid within the flowing peaceful waters in our minds,bodys,n souls.singing like the true songbird she is without no effort at all,she should definately share the queen's throne as the world's greatest singers on this mother earth.after the soulful reverand lee, she slips into the fabulous,do what you gotta do,just like a woman,let it be me, until it's time for you to go,onto the impossible dream to name the grand highlites.A MUST HAVE!!J.H.52757"
5,THE BOMB!!!,THESE RADIOS ARE THE BOMB!!!!! THEY HAVE EXCELLENT RANGE. THE ADDED FEATURE OF A WEATHER RADIO IS ALSO TO DIE FOR!!!!! I'D DEFINITELY BUY THESE RADIOS AGAIN!!!
1,Not Much,"I just received this ""book""--actually a set of 3-hole punched, black and white photocopied pages--and was disappointed. The guide was very simplistic and unoriginal. The writing is mostly the author's paraphrasing of the Constitution along with multiple choice quizzes. One could buy any number of ""real"" books which accomplish the same thing at a much lower price."
3,"I'm torn because these SHOULD be so good,","but they aren't. Not really. Oh, the ingredients are good. I like the use of organic wheat flour, and I generally trust the Annie's brand name. But there's little else about these little crackers to rave about. Why? Because they are almost flavorless. I'm not someone who uses much salt. You won't catch me even touching the salt shaker during a meal, and I probably go through less than 2 ounces of the stuff in an average year of cooking at my house. But I found myself wanting to pull out a salt shaker and sprinkle some of the stuff in the bag, then shaking it so the crackers might at least have a chance of acquiring some taste. I don't know if I got a bad case of these or what (certainly all the other posted raves make me wonder), but I won't be buying them again."
4,Good Breast Pump,"I have no other reference, but I have no major complains. I've used it everyday for 4 months now and have had a good experience. I express 7 ounces in 10 minutes. I read the other reviews stating that they express less milk than with Avent Isis and dont know what pump they are using but it certainly isn't this one.Major flaw: Sometimes the bottle snaps off in the middle of pumping.Overall great cost saving alternative, if compared to MEdela Pump in Style."
1,New mom,"This pump worked fine for 2 mo., then suddenly quick working from the wall plug. It still took the 4 D batteries (and drained them quickly) as a power supply for a while longer then died all together. I think the problem was condensation in the hose (as another reviewer complained), but the real flaw is in the design that would make it so easy to ruin the motor. BabiesRUs was wonderful to take mine back and I bought the medela equivalent. I have been absolutely sold on the medela line and would urge everyone to shell out the extra bucks for a quality pump that will last."
1,Now I know why it was so much cheaper,"I totally agree with all the prior negative reviews. I had the same problems with unequal suction. The containers they provided to store the milk do not fit the lids properly and therefore the milk leaked. My pump quit working completely just after the 90 day warranty had past, so there went the $150 pump down the drain. The pump was so loud that I had to pump in another room with the door closed so I wouldn't wake the baby. I am very disappointed with the pump."
4,Better than the hospital pump,"I like this pump a lot - much better than the hospital pump, because you can do both breasts at once using only one hand, the cups are more comfortable, and the bottle capacity is larger. One complaint - the lids they give you don't fit the bottles properly and they leak, so you'll have to use something else for storage."
1,Don't waste your time or money!!!,My daughter had a hard time breast feeding so I bought this pump because I still wanted her on breastmilk and I heard that this one was less expensive then the others. I should have read the reviews on it first. After a month it lost almost all suction and it wouldn't pump any milk out. (...)I would not recommend this pump to anyone unless you want to waste you money!!!
5,A great read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as did my wife. The storyline is captivating and unique. Robinson also has a great writing style. I look forward to reading his next book."
4,Not bad,"I enjoyed this book, but I sensed that it possibly came from a Catholic perspective.I found that the lives of these apostles were absolutely amazing, and this book helped point that out. But, it seems that precise and accurate information about their lives is difficult to put together because of limited source material. Much of the information is from the scriptures, which is already known. It's a good read though."
2,Not what I expected,It just strings together parts of the Bible to give you biographies of the 12 disciples. I thought this was going to be devoted to what happen to the Band of 12 AFTER the crucifiction.
2,Camera extermely poor quality,While small and cool looking the camera takes very bad pictures unless you are outdoors on a sunny day.
5,Great guitar player!,I really enjoyed the guitar playing on this album. He plays like Kenny Burrell. The rest of the band plays great as well. I recommend this record to jazz fans throughout the world.
4,Weimar Republic North American Style,"I began the American Empire sub-series somewhat reluctantly. Mr. Turtledove did such an outstanding job describing the horrors andgenerally stupid leadership of the First World War, that I was concerned he would not be able to carry the story through the peace. I was very suprised at the content and concept of the new sub-series. Without giving away anything important, I will say that Mr. Turtledove has done an excellent job of ""filing off the serial numbers"" of history and turning the world upside down in a very realistic manner. He shows how often in history, a insignificant person or event can influence the broad flow of history. I enjoyed The Center Cannot Hold, and will have a hard time waiting for the third episode in the sub-series."
5,Immigrant Song CD,"A bargain for the price! I'd have paid more to hear and own the two songs on this CD. Other reviewers have also commented that the best thing about this CD is the second song Hey Hey What Can I Do - and they are right! Plant's vocals are outstanding and Page and the boys do their normal outstanding job - the balance, beat and flow of the song makes we wonder why Atlantic would not have put this song on III or a future releases? Oh well - I have it now - a must buy for the serious Zeppelin fan!!!!! Enjoy!"
1,I didn`t listen and I`m paying the consecuences,"I didn't pay attention to what other people said about poor quality, smaller size and stitchy fabric, and now that I ordered it, I'm paying the consecuences. It's really thin, the turtleneck is not double, just a single piece of clothe put from the neck up.... I'm REALLY dissapointed."
4,Great beginning to a great career,"This being Midler's debut album, one couldn't expect much. However, with a stunning voice, Midler takes off from the beginning. The songs on this album will take you back and make you remember Midler's roots. From the classic ""Friends,"" to her remake of ""Delta Dawn,"" to the slow ballad ""Hello In There,"" Midler not only makes you think, but makes you remember! She is magnificent!"
2,Pass,"For Nancy Friday fans, this book is perfect, because it is almost all about Nancy Friday. Her theories were interesting, I give anyone credit for having enough to say to write a 777 page book; however, most of her theories are not scientifically supported. Instead her theories are derived and supported from experiences from her unique past. Basically if you were looking for a book that talks about the importance of beauty in our society in terms of anthropology, science or even statistics, do not buy this book, as she concentrates mostly on her own experiences. I would like to sit and have lunch with her, she seems wonderful, but this book just wasn't for me."
3,"Technically great, but a little disappointing","I love Irish dance, my daughter is an Irish dancer at the Open level. She competes at about 8-10 feisanna per year. Dancing on Dangerous Ground features two of my favorite dancers, Butler and Dunne. The dancing is terrific in this show, as usual. As a whole, though, I thought it was a little flat and uninteresting at times. I don't think it has the entertainment value of Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. Hopefully these wonderful dancers will get together in another show!"
2,Casa de Stinko,"The first thirty minutes of this movie were very entertaining. The concept was great. The cast was very good. Just looking at will Ferrell can make me laugh. Unfortunetly after 30 minutes the movie runs out of gasolina. I would have walked out but unfortunately I watched it on a plane. Amigos, save your Pesos on this one."
5,Classic satire and intelligent writing,Will Ferrell and Gael Garcia Bernal crew make this a must watch. The satire is crisp and the writing on point.
3,Typical Will Ferrell,Don't expect a great story or great acting. Kind of funny if you're in a good mood. Will Ferrell is really funny.
1,Movie,This movie was all in Spanish. When I rented it I never knew it was all going to be in Spanish with only English Subtitles because it wasn't labeled like that when I ordered it. So I returned it and got a refund. Thank you Amazon for being so understanding and easy to work with when I got a problem with my products.
1,Ferrell's worst movie (so far),This is Will Ferrell's worst movie so far. He seems to be on a steep slope going down. This is almost unwatchable. I could not find anything in the movie worth saying it was good.
1,horrible,will ferrell should be slapped for this!! worst movie I have seen in years! dont waste your money or your time!
2,Not sure what I expected.....,"I love the comedy of Will Ferrell, but this one was a flop in my opinion. A little too goofy, even for Will. I didn't finish the movie, but I'm sure the first 20 minutes were about as good as it gets."
3,"Nice, funny little comedy, if you ""get"" what it's trying to do","I have never been a fan of Will Ferrell, but Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna (who have supporting roles in this) are a different story. A Spanish-language comedy (swear to God) that is actually a pretty sharp send-up of low-budget Mexican dramas that has more genuinely-funny moments than it does pathetic groans of despair. If you're in on the jokes - understand the send-up/parody - than you'll enjoy this; otherwise, you may well think this is the biggest, most unfunny piece of crap film you've seen in awhile. Will Ferrell fans will like it - and, as proven by me, even some non-Ferrell fans will give it three stars, as well."
1,Wrong Style Plug,"Perhaps this isn't an issue for you, but the electrical outlets in my house don't have an extra slot cut in them at a 90 degree angle to the standard direction (on the left prong).Normal configuration is: ||This Plug is: |-This normally isn't a problem (most manufactures put standard plugs on their products) but this AC unit only came, as per Target, with this ridiculous plug. Luckily for me someone else had opened this unit before me and broken it. So Target, very nicely, handled the return. The 14000 BTU unit does not have this problem and seems to work fine - although it shuts off before my thermometer says it's at the indicated temperature. This is a minor inconvenience by comparison. One more note - you must have a 20amp circuit to run this unit (some ads mention this and some do not) it will trip 15amp breakers."
4,Plant's best solo album,"Pictures at eleven is the closest Plant's solo career would get to the Zeppelin sound. He was searching for his a new sound and didn't veer to far, he did later with synths and I wasn't all that thrilled. Most of the songs are well written and played tight. He enlisted Robbie Blunt, Paul Martinez, Jez Woodruffe and Phil Collins and Barrimore Barlow on drums. Highlights include Burning down one side(the MTV video for this song was simply amazing!), slow dancer, moonlight in samoza and the infectious pledge pin(with sax solo,sorta odd, I'd like to hear a Blunt guitar solo instead!)but overall a solid yet experimental immediate post Zep solo album. I really like this record and still play it regularly! The production values stillsound as crisp and clear now as it did in the early 1980s. It holds up well and is still my fav Plant solo record, without a doubt. Give it a listen for yourself, you'll agree!"
5,Scotch Laser Lens Cleaner,Product is satisfactory - as I knew it would be. Just a little disgruntled because I paid more in shipping for the product (sent from the same state in which I live) than for the product itself!
2,Didn't solve my problem,"When I receved the product,, the plastic cover holding the CD to the carboard was detatched, and the jewel case was broken at the hinges, making tit look like a used item. When I put the CD/DVD cleaner disc in any of my players, it either didn't work at all, or it skipped itself, like some of my CDs. When it moved on to the cleaning mode, it didn't seem to really do anything. I then tested my players with Cds (old and new), but the players either didn't play, or they still skipped.Dissappointing!!"
3,Candide is the only good book that came out of this.,"This book is a good book to read if you want to realize that Voltaire's novels are ONLY a hype. Candide was the only book in it that I liked but even that was ok. Zandig and Ingenious are worth mentioning, but in Ingenious Voltaire proves hes a conformist by modern standards. It was AMAZING then you read the last few sentences and its killed. That's why it isn't as famous as Candide and will never be."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"This is the loveliest book I've read in years. Simply wonderful. The characters are enchanting and distinctive in their voices while the story kept me hooked from beginning to end.The Town That Came A-Courtin' is endorsed by best-selling authors as well as actress Sela Ward. All endorsements are glowing and, after reading the book, I can say ""Well earned.""Perfect summer time reading or just plain perfect for any occasion."
5,You need to have this in your office!,"There is no other comprehensive hanbook available for the practice of architecture. Everything you need to know to run an architectural firm, from a small office to a large one is handled in these volumes. It includes samples of all the AIA documents, including the B141. You need to have this in your office if you are an architect."
2,It was too big & clumsy.,The case that came with the Phillips DVD Player fit much better in the car.I might keep this one to stor the DVD Player.It was hard to try and fit it in our car. Its a good case don't get me wrong but too much work to try and figure out.
3,Good for the money but it is not to practical,I like the quality that I received for the money but the straps are kind of complicated and messy. They should have a better system not only for the car but in general to use it like outdoors. But overall you can protect your DVD player and somehow display it inside the bag.
5,READ WITH ERROGENOUS ZONES,THESE TWO BOOKS REALLY WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE...THEY SHOULD BE MANDATORY READING IN HIGH SCHOOLS TODAY.
4,Do the victim test on the back of the book first...,"...in case you don't need to buy this book! Just joking. Almost every one of us is victimized in some aspects of his/her life as you will realize by reading this book, some more and some less. I think this book can prove useful to everyone in order to spot his/her self-victimizing behaviors and ways of thinking and improve. You will also recognize people in your environment either as victims or non-victims (and potentially ""victimizers""). The test on the back of the book is representative. I scored almost the same score in situations that have applied to my life as in the hypothetical ones. Although I was happy to see that I was not on the ""victim-side"", also realizing that in the course of reading the book, I still think it as very useful to me and you too may recognize some aspects of your behavior that are self-victimizing (or even victimizing towards others)."
3,Great pen but not lefty friendly,"I have this pen and it is a very neat design. Extremely portable and handy.However, the formulation of ink has a fairly long drying time and any left hander knows that will lead to smearing. If only there were other inserts with faster drying inks. I realize I would not be able to write underwater or upside down with the other insert but then I would not have a blue finger either."
2,Just a Pen,"Its a pen good for traveling. Yet, pens are one of the first few things to get lost on a traveling trip. I might not want to risk it.Next, its a pen that can write upside down. But writing upside down is very uncomfortable, not easy and its bad for the eyes. For the sake of health, i won't do it.Thirdly, the ink smudges as much as an oil based <$1 pens.Finally, the ink on paper aesthetically leaves much to be desired. I may write with this fancy pen but people will think i wrote with a pen i stole from the waitress.I like the casing that is about the length of my middle finger when closed. Its slight weight helps make it feel stable in the hand. Its a nice gift to compliment an internet hype. But once he/she realizes my earlier points, he/she will have another good gift set to compliment an internet hype.On a last note, the pen DOES NOT write on any surface. I need some sympathy here.Sex appeal: 00%Nerd Appeal: 95%Engineering Appeal: 15% (for writing upside down)"
4,A great collection!,"To all the nay-sayers... Who cares?They are not all original Warner Bros films. However, they are all popular, recognizable films that most people would be proud to have as a part of their collection, especially people who don't own much blu-ray. Personally I own about 10 of these movies, but if someone got me this set as a gift, I would not be displeased!Of course there are quite a few films that should have been included, but it seems they chose not necessarily the best films but the most popular. And the price is dropping already. When it inevitably hits $250, that's only $5 a film, not a bad deal for popular blu-rays. It's simply a collector's box set.The point is, if you like the films, get the set. That's the point. Who cares if they're legit original WB movies? When the price drops a little more, I'll probably pick up the set."
4,Great way to get started on yoga!,"This is the first yoga tape that I've ever done. The workout was challenging, and, yes, truly relaxing. After all the stretching, my body felt less tense. Wai Lana is a very serene instructor; her voice is calm and soothing as she guides you through the poses. I'm not very flexible, and I found the poses manageable. The only part I wasn't crazy about was the musical meditation at the end. I found it more distracting than relaxing. I recommend this video and plan on using it again."
1,Reely good,"I love it cause its horrororific, got lotsa words and I study english, deserves more stars than I give it ."
2,meh...,"Way too much effort put into relationship between characters. It is a chick-flick, not a movie about surviving. The movie is at times very silly, only a naive viewer can tolerate it. There is no realism, no any scientific background - only emotions, love, tears, screams. Again, someone looking for a romance-drama will probably be happy. I am very disapointed."
3,Almost Old Enough to Drink,"Wow! Is this recording 21 years old already? This is not Mr. Denver's best work. But, it is solid mid-1970's pop music from a master of the genre. Unfortunately, the album was originally released in 1980, a few year too late to enjoy great commercial success. The music on the album ranged from traditional Denver pop, to forays deep into bluegrass. Of particular interest is John's cover of Jimmy Ibbotson's ""Dance Little Jean"" which is included as a bonus track. John has often covered Dirt Band tunes and he does this one well enough. It is just not as good as the original. So now we John Denver fans can complete our collection of his music on CD. It has been a long time to wait, but worth it."
2,"Too ""country""","I think I only liked ONE selection on this cd. It was much too countryfor me. I love John, but not this cd."
4,useful for computer repairs,Have used it for repairing and replacing parts in my laptop. Till now no sparks and the computers have survived so far so good.
1,Um... what did I just see?,"I love The Who album ""Tommy."" The countless hours I've spent listening to it have been great. Then I rented the movie one night since I heard it was so good. I couldn't be any more wrong.Some performances were great, like Roger Daltry and Elton John, but others are just horrible. Like.... oh pretty much everyone else in this movie.Then, at the very end, I'm not quite sure what happened. I had to rewind it and watch it one more time to see if maybe it'd make more sense if I saw it a second time. But no.Too many new songs, all a little flat or melodramatic. And none have the same brilliance that the original songs have. Too much weird stuff. Too many bad performances. The movie's too long, too. It's all so much to take in that the greatness that is the album is completely lost. Waste of your time."
2,WAY TOO WEIRD,"WELL TO ENJOY THIS FILM YOU MUST REALLY BE INTO NOSTALGIA.I FOUND IT HARD TO KEEP UP WITH WHATS GOING ON IN THE MOVIE,PLENTY OF DALTREY BUT NOT ENOUGH OF THE REST OF THE WHO.IT WAS COOL TO SEE SOME OF THE STARS AT THAT AGE,ALSO NOT ENOUGH WHO MUSIC WORKED INTO THE MOVIE.TOO BIZARE TO WATCH A SHOW WITH NO DIALOGUE,I PERSONALLY WAS DISAPOINTED WITH IT.WELL GARAGE SALE FODDER!"
5,How could you not love it?,"Tommy is, by far, one of my favorite 70's films - next to 'Rocky Horror' and 'Clockwork Orange'. Yes, it is big and loud and bizzarre but what did you expect from one of the first 'rock operas'?Tommy is a nice satire about money and it's various corruptions - a mute and deaf boy who becomes a wizard at pinball and later has his image used to build a large palace/amusement park of sorts. We view the masses reaching for him and demanding he take them to the heights HE'S reached.It's all about immediate gratification, you know."
2,a REVIEW from an OWNER ....sadly NO bonus features!!!!,"I was thrilled to pick this up a few days early at my local record store....but HORRIFIED to find it a bare bones affair. Yes, it does look even better than the Superbit version but my UK 2 DVD set from 2004 has HOURS of bonus features...1) Director Commentary2) insightful interview with Ken Russell by Mark Kermode3) more of Ken Russell discussing Tommy4) Pete Townshend interview5) Roger Daltrey interview6) Ann-Margret interview7) Trailer, Press Promo materials, a featurette on the Sound...NONE of this is on the new Blu-RAY....with any luck it will all be on an all region UK blu-ray..I'll refer to this version as a Boo-Ray...GREAT MOVIE...but I can't rate this a 5 STAR Blu-Ray DVD...my review is NOT for the movie but the product/presentation itself..."
4,just like I remeber it,"I first had this film when I was young... 14.... I have been looking for this movie for a long time in Norway. I found it here!!! and it was still gooood!!! My kid, who is 14 did not like it...."
1,Tommy...,"This is one of the rock operas EVER. The songs are lyricly wonderful but ANN MARGERT SINGING ROCK IS JUST EVIL!!!!!THERE ARE ONLY 3 GOOD SONGS ON IT IM FREE,ACID QUEEN,AND PINBALL WIZARD. ELTON JOHN'S CHARACTER WAS WEIRD I THOUGHT HIS DAD DIED IN A WAR INA PLANE!THEN HOW COME I SAW BERNIE HIT HIM WITH A LAMP KILLING HIM. AND ALSO THEY NEVER STOP SINGING! EVER!!!!!INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS...DROP [$$] ON THE WHO'S GREATEST HITS OR PINK FLOYD THE WALL"
5,Loved it!,What can I say that hasn't already been said? The acting is phenomenal as is the music. Roger's smokin' hot in it and Keith is excellent as Uncle Ernie---very creepy and gross!
3,"See it for Eric, Elton, and Tina.","When this movie came out I was in high school and the consensus amongst the oh-so cool high school rock critics was that ""Tina Turner's pelvis saved the movie!"" Turns out, we may have been overly harsh; the Eric Clapton and Elton John scenes are also worth a peek. But in the end, without Clapton paying homage to Maryln Monroe, John's Pinball Wizard, and the amazing-beyond-belief Turner as the Acid Queen, this movie would only be laughable."
5,Pure genius,"One of the key titles of the seventies and of the counterculture spirit, and a truly ""tour de force"" of surreal and sarcastic visual invention. Iconoclast and subversive british director Ken Rusell filmed in 1975 this satyrical rock opera with synthetic and rabidly mesmerezing visual imagination using many of the icons ( from psychodelic designs and underground imaginary to the musical pop stars of the moment: Tina Turner; Elton John and Eric Clapton make self-parodic cameos in the movie ) of the age so as some of the topicals of Hollywood melodrama to build a sardonically kitsch revision of the british Establisment; the cynicism and obscure interests of organized religion and the star system deliriums through the story of Tommy: a blind, deaf and dumb middle-class child who becomes a sort of messiahnic pinball star. Music and lyrics by the mythical band The Who.Widescreen edition."
4,Arrived in time for the holidays.,Fast shipping. Its a cult classic. You either love it or you hate it. Great quality bluray. My wife loved it as a christmas gift.
3,No extras carried over from the British DVD?,"From what i read,there will be no extras,I personally love the movie,but will wait until it hits $9.99,and stick with the brilliant British 2 disc DVD,with interviews and commentries."
4,Functional and reasonably priced,I use this to cool a very small bedroom and it works great. It was a little tricky to install (getting the window sealed off) but that's my only complaint.
5,Best Daikaiju movie (Irys),"These are the best Daikaiju movies since Gojira (1954).We all have personal favorite daikaiju movies (if you;re a fan of them, or else why would you be reading this), but these movies achieve the seemingly impossible balance of a daikaiju movie where the human actor parts are not just parts you fast-forward through."
5,Definitely worth the price,"I was actually expecting these movies to be a lot cornier. Yeah, Gamera is obviously a guy in a rubber suit, but even with that, the effects are really well done The dubbing is also excellent... once you find the option for English language rather than Japanese (would have been nice on the main menu), the voices synch up pretty well. There are a few spots where there is quite a bit of untranslated Japanese text on the screen, even with the subtitles turned on. But overall, the stories are very good... the first two are typical of the genre, and the third is surprisingly dark. At 10 bucks for 3 movies, it's a good bargain."
5,Gamera Rocks!,"I grew up with these classic monster flicks as a Kid. My favorite would be Godzilla, and that is why he is King of the monsters. However, Gamera is no slouch, I Originally had the DVD set but had to sell them when I had to move. But like may thing time change and I had to up grade and when I saw these three on blu-ray at this price the decision was a no brainer. These are a must have for anyone who is a giant monster fan."
3,Bethany Frankel,"Movie is a little corney, but still not too bad to watch. It shows Bethany in probably one of her first experiences at acting, and it shows."
3,Just okay,"This book was a bit of a disapointment. My daughter and I love to make books together and are always looking for new creative ideas. This didn't have much to it and what it did, was just pretty tacky. The directions were a bit vague and I sold the book quickly after purchasing."
5,Terrific book,I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. I was admiring the wonderful books she had made and she told me about the book. The directions are clear with good pictures and diagrams and the range of types of books is very good. This is a great book to have if you are interested in exploring making books.Book Arts: Beautiful Bindings for Handmade Books
1,Read the Jesus Mysteries,"The Jesus Mysteries is a much more accurate book than this one. This one seems to be inspired by fear. Christmas and Easter are basically pagan holdays, after all. Easter is a celebration of life's cycle of birth-death-rebirth, a spring rite common to most resurrection cults going back to Egypt's Osiris. In fact many historians now believe that the Christ figure is based on Osiris."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is the ""Radiohead Bible"" as I've dubbed it. It gives you an in-depth story about the band, how they started out, how they met, and just about everything else. It has an EXCELLENT discography as well. There aren't many pictures, but the ones in there aren't found anywhere else [like pictures of the boys from college]. It's a great book, I loved reading it."
3,bootleg?,"Product was not packaged as NEW, looks like it was shrink-wrapped in the back of the store. Inserts were of very poor quality-reproduced on a POOR copy machine. Made in Austria label****not sure how to feel about this. All in all both disks I ordered look like bootlegged copies, made by someone with lots of gear, in their basement, ....in Austria. So far audio 5.1 sounds okay, but I don't believe these are original sacd's. Ya might want to check your product!!!!!"
2,Well at least they can play their instruments,"I don't think anything really describes this album better than ""I've heard better.""BFBE is a disappointing attempt by a small label to get their ""big rock band."" Too bad ""big rock bands"" tend to lack style and creativity needed to add the ""big"" to their name.I would recommend anything but this junk. Even the God-awful tunes of Hinder seem perfect comparitively."
1,Tons of guts to charge that much,"Simple, basic, waste of money. Nothing of value to anyone who knows the bare-bones basics of car selling is contained in this very thin book (really doesn't qualify as a book but is priced like one). I wish they had a rating of zero stars for this one. If they drop the price to a nickel and you pay the shipping you are getting a raw deal."
2,Took too long to ship,This is the first book that I ordered that took almost a month to get here. Usually I only have to wait a week. When I emailed them they said that they were still in the realm of expection of shipment but I thought that was a lousy answer. I did recieve it and the book was in good condition.
1,A basic guide to importing,"Dear amazonI would love to write a review, except I never received the book in questioned--did not report it due to there were to link to report missing items. I would love a response, better yet, my purchased.thank youErnestine Smith1308 Moretz AveCharlotte, NC 28206"
5,A wonderful synthesis of tradition and scholarship.,"The New Analytical Study Bible uses the classic KJV text, but inserted are all the changes mandated by modern versions. Therefore a person can have the best of both worlds: The beautiful prose of the KJV with the accuracy of modern textual criticism. The comments and outlines are helpful as well, reflecting neither conservative nor liberal scholarship. The helps are very scholarly and middle-of-the-road theologically."
5,"Great product, great price","We purchased this creamer to complete the place setting that we received at our wedding shower. It matches the existing plates, bowls, dishes, etc that were purchased from a department store several years ago."
2,Technical mumbo jumbo,"If you only want to know the ""why"" of the golf swing and not the ""How to"" this is the book for you. I see this as a reference manual... sort of a dictionary for someone learning a language. You can read it, everythings in there... but you still may not be able to ""use"" it."
5,Complicated but a must read,This book is complicated but it has the secret to golf for hitting the ball far and straight. Lag or delayed hit if your into the science of golf like geometry or physics this book is for you. This is how Sergio Garcia at 160 pouns or so hits 300 yds. He drops the club to the inside and hold his wrist cock until cetrfigual force uncocks them.
2,Not for beginners,This is essentially a catalog of Homer Kelley' observations of the golf swing. It is not an instruction manual. It is not a philosphy of golf. Homer Kelley wrote technical manuals describing the work of others. This book follows that pattern. Mr. Kelley's observations break down the swing into atomistic parts which can remove all fluidity from a golfer's swing. There are thousands of cross references in this book. You won't be able to find some of them.
3,An Okay Package,"Mt parents will never thanks Robert Englund for the sleepless nights he gave me as a young boy when NOES was released in 1984. Although i can watch it now, our favourite villain's subsequent movies left a lot to be desired. The first movie is definitely the classic (in particular the bedroom sequence with Tina & Freddy's extended arms in the alleyway). Later movies really cash in on Freddy-mania & deviate towards black comedy rather than going out to give audiences a good scare - altho Part 3 (with Langenkamp returning again as Nancy) is a forgivable part of these 5 movies. The rest is really candyflosss watching & worthy to have as part of the Freddy saga. Thank heavens parts 6 & 7 were not included here, as otherwise I would have to give only 1 star! Definitely worth investigation if you love the first movie or indeed wish to make this part of your DVD Collection."
2,NO SPANISH SUBTITLES!!!??????,"Well , let me say that it was very disappointing that this DVD set doesn?t have Spanish subtitles, i though after buying Friday the 13th DVD Box Set , i would buy nightmares` , but noooooooo, here in MExico we dont have Nightmare on elm street DVD`s , except Part 1, Hello New Line Cinema Home Video USA!!! You have lost for many years alot of sales here!!!Salutes!! From just one of hundreds of disappointed Nightmare on Elm Street MExican Fans,!!!"
1,the worst horror film of all time,"this film had been always played more than 16 times in each months, you can watch them on TV in europe.The story symbolized the cruels and sadism of the teenager murder like Freddy Krueger but the literature significance is nothing to be found in this story.If you like the classic horror film, here below is one very accurate example for you:Please check out Mr. Mario Brava, he was a very good italian director especially in the horror films during the 60's. Thats why I said that the old italian or britishhammer horror filmswere much much better than the hollywood cheap modern scray tales. I said well the old british and italian horror films are much betterthan the modernhollywodd one, because the stories had a full classical literary meaning and the interpretation was absolutely excellent, which the modernHollywood scarryfilms are not interrested in it."
1,filth,all the charecters in these movies were just set up to die so you do not care about them but in halloween you actually had charecter development so you care about them these movies are rip offs of halloween any way there all pretty much the same freddy will come and kill the teenagers in there dream one by one the main charecter will try to convince her friends but they wont believe her then she fights him in her dreams1.B- it was decent and fun2.F the begining of bad sequels3.F they tried to make it difrent but failed4.F boring too dull5.F Stupid the plot was weird6.F did not even finish all of it because it was so bad7.C it was alright nice to see heather back even tough she was in the third this was her real renuinion.Do not get this I only recomend renting the first and i recomend renting the seventh.
5,Review,I have always liked the Nightmare movies. Freddy Krueger is the ultimate villian. He is way better than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees combined. This is a must have for all Freddy Krueger fans and late 80s horror flicks.
4,Should have read the fine print,"Picture displayed was the 4 Nightmare movie compilation, what was written was the 2010 Nightmare movie, and the latter was what I got. I thought I was getting the 4 movie compilation. The picture ought to match the exact nature of the product."
2,two stars is ok,"I agree with the 12 years old reviewer below. cause I am also a fan of Hammer horror classical films in the 50's and 60's and included of course the mario brava films, they have alots of literature significance. But these Nightmare/ FREDDY Series mean nothing to get the value of the classic horror literature like what the Hammer british horror films or Brava films had done in the past 40 years. These modern Hollywood horror series only showing the violences, ignorances and the brutes without having any interrest in the significance of classical qualified literature like perhaps Boris Karrloff, bela lugosi or Vincent price ever did in the post war period in the 40's."
5,Horror Classic,I have yet to watch any of them...why you ask? Cause my fiance is petrified of Freddy! WE are adults now and she still has any image burned in her head of that melted grousum face! She really thinks that he will come for her in her dreams...when we get married first thing will be to watch all of them straight!
5,Super awesome box set!,I bought this set in August 2003...I saw the Freddy vs. Jason movie and I was completely obsessed with NOES stuff. I looked online and found this DVD set and had to get it. What a great deal it is and it has cool extras on the 8th disc. I hadn't watched many of these movies for years and I remembered now how much of a Freddy fan I am. I even joined the Englundlist on Yahoo and checked out the RobertEnglund.com website. Woohoo!! I totally think Robert is a wonderful actor and not just as Freddy but in all the movies he was in. A must have set for any fan!
5,freddy's home.....,"i admit when i first rented/saw all of these movies i thought they were all pretty worthless save for parts 1&7. i NEVER thought i'd be owning the whole series someday. but when i saw that these had come out on dvd in this huge package and knowing that new line is the BOMB when it comes to dvd, i had to get them....every horror movie fanatic should get these....even if you don't really care 4 freddy like i didn't you should still get these....it's an incredible deal so everyone should get into it."
5,I love Freddy Kruger,"I do own the DVD box set and I suggest that anyone who's a Nightmare on Elm Street fan to buy the box set. The movies look so clear on DVD, there's a cool dics that comes with it and you'll never get tired of watching it. I like every NOE except 5 & 6. It seemed like they tried to make Freddy a comedian, if your gonna make a horror movie don't make your main character funny it just doesn't work. Freddy vs Jason was alright, I just didn't like the acting in the movie and the storyline was too short. I do still enjoy watching all of those movies."
4,My kids love them!,"My kids (almost 4 and 1) love these crackers. We always have a box in the car. They are healthy and tasty - much better for kids than Goldfish. My only complaint (thus the 4 stars) is that they are a bit greasy and can stain things. My little one sometimes sits on them in her carseat and gets stains on her clothes and also on our couches ;-) . I try to be careful, but sometimes it is invevitable.The price here is the best I have seen (better than Annie's own website) and this larger size is not available many places. It is even better when Amazon is running an instant rebate on them!"
3,Religion class experience,"A fair text for a freshmen high school religion class. Sometimes Powell got a little too caught up in relating outdated anecdotes and quoting worn cliches, but not as mind-numbingly technical as most text books."
3,"Hang on, it&#65533;s not THAT bad!","The poor reception that this album has received over the years is due to the fact that it is good whereas its predecessor is brilliant. Just when we thought that Stephen Stills may have hit the motherlode, this confirmed that the double LP ""Manassas"" was one `out of the box' and that he didn't have what it takes to sustain the band or the brilliance.It is a worthwhile record, though! He has put out much weaker albums than this since. Buy it and enjoy and when you get to `Rollin' My Stone', CRANK IT UP!"
4,Underrated,"Brilliant guitar playing, excellent all-around musicianship and singing, and fine, inventive songwriting make this a fine, enjoyable album. Stills' ""Isn't It About Time"" and ""Do You Remember the Americans"", and Hillman's ""Lies"" are excellent, while the rest of the album is never less than good. Joe Walsh's slide guitar playing is excellent, but you have to wonder why it was necessary to add another guitarist. Overall, it does sound a little thrown together, definitely not comparable to their prior masterpiece, but still an enjoyable album. Somewhere between three and four stars."
4,There are some classics.....,"This album is a must for any hardcore Stills or Manassas fan. This album gives you more of a bluesy-country feel, and Stills really belts out his ruff, gruff, vocals on this album. Simply put, this album is just as good as all the rest of Stills work."
1,HEY! WHERE'S THE WORKBOOK?,"Just purchased this video, began to watch it, and realized that it requires the ""Learn Math Quickly"" workbook. This workbook is not offered by Amazon. Without the workbook, the video is useless as the video's instructor asks the viewer repeatedly to refer to it and perform tasks in it. Could be worth more than one star, but I guess I'll never know!!"
4,Tegner Book,"I like the book, of course. That's why I ordered it.I first read a couple of Bruce Tegner's books when I was in Junior High (Middle) School. I'm sorry I lost them but I'm sure you've probably got all or most of them in stock.In any case, I'm very satisfied with this one.Thank You."
5,A Must Read for 2005!,"This book is a real page turner that beautifully delineates the dramatic story of the life of Victorian era medium Maggie Fox and her era. While it is a biography, Nancy Rubin Stuart's ""The Reluctant Spiritualist"" reads like a novel even as it describes the rise of spiritualist movement, Maggie's initial role in it and her thrilling, but ultimately tragic romance with Arctic explore Elisha Kent Kane. There's something for ever reader in this book--social history,engaging characters, a great love story, and of course, the ongoing question about the life of the spirit. A terrific read!Wendy S."
1,For a small business owner not the average consumer...,"I purchased this book thinking that the author provided a voice to capture my thoughts when dealing with merchants. Why I ever doubted my ability to write my experience with a product or services, I do not know.I agree that this book provides a template. If you use a Wordprocessing software application it already comes with one.I would not recommed this as a purchase for the average consumer.This book is written more for the small business owner, who for example, is attempting to collect bad debts or negotiating for better pricing on business services."
1,"Stay away from this book, author and publisher!","I have never seen such a useless book and so-called software. It truly serves no literary purpose for any use, either personal or professional. The ""software"" isn't even software, and if you hate it, you are stuck with it as the publisher will not take returns if opened. I should have learned my lesson from my first bad experience from this publisher, but I gave them another chance on this one. Now I will never buy anything from them again. And the so-called author has zero merit, no binding credentials, and an empty resume that gives him no right to instruct anyone on writing ANY form of letter."
2,A re-release of a previous book,"The names of characters and places have changed a little, but Raven's Gate is definitely the Devil's Door-bell. I feel foolish for having bought this book when I already read Devil's Door-bell. I didn't realize this was going to be the same book. This is a case of an author cashing in on his current popularity to try and make money on his older books. Books that did not sell well... and for good reason. This book is not up to the standards of his Alex Rider series."
5,More than you expected.,Excellent product and much more than I expected. I have ridging on my thumbs. You can tell when I started taking the bee pollen. The ridging stops right at the point I started to take it. My nails were so weak that they were always breaking. Now they are growing.Once had a nutritionist who said that when your nails are strong that means that the rest of your body is strengthening. If your body can start to put attention to your nails - it means that the more essential parts of your body are stronger as well.I am very happy with this product.
3,Good....but not great.,"I had fairly high hopes that I would learn something new, and get some inside scoop about one of my all time favorite shows. While Stephen Cole appears to have been given access to a broad array of information, details and trivia, I somehow thought there might be more. Perhaps a little something juicy, tiny tidbits that we weren't supposed to know until now. In Cole's defense, maybe there just wasn't anything else. As he mentions in the book, the set was a happy one, everyone got along. Kinda boring, right? Even on I Love Lucy, it was always fun to know that Vance and Frawley hated one another. Rumor has it that Thomas is supposed to be difficult.....not even a mention? All in all, if you loved the show, you'll enjoy the book."
2,"sorry, dude, but:","This one just didn't grip my nuts the right way. I know the author writes in an experimental, say-whatever-the-hell-comes-to-his-head-at-the-moment fashion...but I thought this one, having a small semblance of a plot, could've used it more. A serial killer would seem like an ideal topic for Rogers, but he doesn't use it. I'm wondering if it's not time for Rogers to focus less on himself and more on the writing. The 'experimental' aspects could use a refreshment. Still, his books are good for reading while taking dumps between classes. I'll hit you up when I read the next one."
3,Better than that other one,"Has its moments. Shakes me out of my usual reading patterns, I guess that's a good thing for a book to do. I like how honest the author is about being all over the book - hey look at me! Me me me! That's true of a great many authors but they're not usually so honest about it, or so nonchalant. Yeah, I like that bit. And the end. Y'know, when he actually uses a narrative line (gasp!)."
1,Poor at best,"If you are an experience martial artist don't bother, if your looking for a new gimmick workout go for it."
2,Wish I had gone with another illustration.,"I'm glad on the one hand that the Golden Press people decided to make this classic Christmas poem into one of their Little Golden Books, but on the other hand, I think they could have found a better illustration to put with it. I don't care for this style of artwork and wish I had looked through more illustrations before buying it. It definitely isn't up to par with other Little Golden Books that I own and have read."
3,Bargain quality for the bargain price.,"Not for a two year old.It's a rather cheaply made book. It's right for the price though.It is the classic story I remember and I will buy a nicer book when my child is old enough to enjoy the rhyming words.If you are looking for this story for your kids, invest in a more expensive, better illustrated book!"
2,Book review...,Purchased this book for a grandchild to be born soon. We had bought many many Little Golden Books when our kids were small. What a disappointment... The cover was cut smaller than the pages! We coordinated a return and received another copy without delay - same cover-cut-smaller issue. Not happy with this at all. What happened with LGB?
5,best tool for the money,"the malco ty4g tensioning tool is the best tool for zip ties, plus its reasonably priced. thanks for asking"
3,It lightens you up but doesnt clear dark marks,my overall skin tone got lighter but my acne marks were still there just a little lighter. but it lightened my overall skin tone ALOT!! I went from NW43 in Mac makeup to a NC40. It made the undertone of my skin yellowish. I am a African American by the way. When I tried to use it again it broke me out so im looking for other options.
3,The List Murders,"Righteous Carnage is not the best book on the List Murders. I found that Joe Sharkey's ""Death Sentence"" went into much more detail about what List did after he fled NJ, and provided more and better photos. But if you have an interest in this fascinating murder case, then by all means purchase it."
5,Excellent quality,"Excellent reading, some funny stories, some intense, most very good, with a couple of stories, like the girl-who-only-wore-red-dresses one, that just soar with imagination and wild fantasy!"
3,Microsoft Office Excell 2003: Comprehensive Course (Microsoft Office 2003 Series),"Overall it's pretty good. It's very methodical, thorough, and straight forward as a teaching tool to learn the Excel program. A good knowlege of business math helps in understanding what the program can do otherwise it can sometimes be a stretch to fully comprehend the application. It's a solid independant study text. However, I am greatly frustrated by typos and other errata, thus, the 3-Star rating. There is a revised edition that is supposed to have been edited for the problems. I'm a little surprised that Microsoft allowed the publisher to go ahead and publish this text due to the high degree of technicality required in the industry. The manual at the user/learner end should not contain any errata. But, on the up side, figuring out what the correct info should be in order for the instruction to be correct or make sense helped in the learning process."
4,Good price.,"I renewed my hubby's subscription to this magazine through Amazon. It's one of his faves, and I'd rather have hunting mags on the back of the toilet than what could be there. LOL. I love the convenience of Amazon, and the magazines autorenewal is just icing on the cake!"
3,Doesn't matter which of the six...,"The Jedi Council sets suffer from weak figure and sculpt choices for previously issued characters. It also is confusing in that it is a cross between the Episode I and Episode II Jedi councils. Now there are some unique characters that haven't been offered in any other setting as well now reduced to only Depa Bilpa and Opo Ranciss. Considering that most of these other figures are now considered Super Articulated you could get by getting the a set of six floors and their chairs to make the council chamber and fill them with better figures for the most part.However the figures aren't the ""star"" of this set as much as the council chamber is. While the color is inaccurate it does the job well enough for display provided you have a fairly deep shelf (18""or so), but it won't fall or drop if only 12"" deep."
1,"Go back to bed, Tony","Here we go again: ""security"" person Sanchez is recycling for, what, the THIRD time since ""Up & Down With The Rolling Stones?"" Sanchez, your ""credibility"" evokes the same exact kind of laughter like your scene in ""Gimme Shelter,"" where one of the Maysles sticks a light-meter in your face while Mick & Keef are dancing around to ""Brown Sugar,"" and you flash that...pretty scowl.

You've already...what ""perjured"" yourself before...& before....& before. You're just recyling you perjury for, what, the third time? Give it up, man..."
1,yesterdays snooze.......,Alert: Recycled and Rebranded book from the 80's.by a real Boring Snitch.How's that..?
2,I've yet to find a Bluetooth headset that works.....,"I've tried the Jabra, several models of the Jawbone and a couple of other devices. I've yet to find something that works well and fits comfortably. I must have weirdly shaped ear canals because I cannot get one of these to fit in a way that I don't have to push it into my ear and hold it there to hear what the other person is saying; even on high volume."
1,Not for Nissan Titan,I ordered this kit for a 2007 Nissan Titan SE. Amazon indicated that this was the correct kit for my vehicle. I received the kit that I ordered and it doesn't fit my Nissan. I checked with AirLift customer service and they indicated that they have the wrong kit listed for the Titan. The correct kit is 59554 not 59544.
4,Mixed review,"Bret Lott has few peers when it comes to lyrical language and storytelling in the Southern tradition. He has no peers when it comes to a man writing in a woman's voice (Jewel, before this one). I started off loving this book; my enthusiasm waned when the two women moved back ""home."" The kinfolk they barely knew were over-the-top folksy, stereotypical. When Naomi went to the hospital, a cardiac patient, and the whole clan gathered in her room, the scene was totally unrealistic. No doctor or hospital would allow that kind of commotion. Even the elusive Beau stayed overnight with her.Repetition that could have been edited: dozens of descriptions of someone crossing his arms, touching someone's hair, arm, hand ..... took in a breath, held it, let it go.... put the key in the ignition, started the car, backed out of the driveway ....Despite the flaws, all in all, a good read."
5,Pleasure to read and to savor.,"Leery at first that this was a rewrite or paraphrase of the Biblical story, I hesitated to read this book. However, once I started it, it claimed me in the first chapter. It covers a wide range of human responses and emotions. It is composed of authentic pain and authentic joy. It is a pleasure to read and to savor.GBS"
4,A good find,"I found this book on the bargain shelves, surprised to see the author of the acclaimed ""Jewel"", which I enjoyed. Happily, I enjoyed this book just about as much.A modern day tale of ""Ruth"", two women, a mother in law and her daughter in law, try to move on after both of their husbands have passed away. Much of this story is narrative on what is ordinary, what we may each take for granted each day. But there is much more in these womens lives that we find out about. And much more on emotion and feeling. Love, loss, despair, courage, hope, humility, loyalty....I enjoyed the book, as I have several of other Lott's. (I've checked out a few of his prior-to-Jewel-success works) I think this is a great book, by a talented author."
2,Nothing of use to me...,"I was SO excited when I bought the book online. Then I got it, and I was sorely disappointed. The beginning text is very cold and, I thought, a bit combative. As for the garden plans... I was looking for MAGICAL gardens, not gardens with magical names. I don't feel that the plant selections were made with any thought whatsoever. How easy is it to search online for plants with ""fairy,"" ""angel,"" or ""witch"" in the name? It takes more than that to make a garden magic!"
5,The Best of Best Dream Books,This book is thorough with detail descriptions. Easy to look up dreams and for those interested in numerology gives a number sequence to pursue. This book is the best dream book I have found.
3,not good for kindle,I love Zolar but hard to manuver (sp) with kindle not going to get this type of book again .dome
3,Not Quite What I had envisioned,"In purchasing this book, I noted that the index covered some major cases and I anticipated a review of the court as perceived through the writings of it major decisions. And although the book starts out this way, it changes to more to a memoir of the Chief Justice, his time working clerking on the court and arguing in front of it. The book's final chapters focuses on the procedures within the court. How they oral arguments occur, how they discuss decisions behind chambers, etc. This part was indeed fascinating, but again, not really what I had imagined when I purchased the book. Overall, the Chief Justice does a good job of reviewing some major cases, and identifying the tone and procedures inside the most important arm of government that few people really know."
4,"The ""Chief's"" Perspective",For the interested layman. Interesting chapters on the inner workings of the Court. Reviews of important cases going back to Marbury v. Madison. Fascinating discussion of the interaction of politics with the judicial process focusing on the Steel Seizure case.
3,got bored. stopped reading half way through,"It got off to a fairly interesting start, but by half way, I was quite bored. I recommend getting her audio CD ""Cyborgasm"" instead. It's far better value (and you can experience it while stuck in rush-hour traffic)."
4,Los Alamos Memory,"I purchased this item while visiting the Los Alamos Museam for Atomic Energy and its tribute to the birth of the atomic age. It caught my eye while quite a distance away and it was an impulsive purchase when I found out it it was the last one. I found that with weak batteries it will fail to run long hence with good batteries you can make this mobile create quite a beautiful display of alternating rings of color and light as it spins and alternates with each kinetic repulsion. Its quite enjoyable and I am happy I purchased it. Watching it is almost like trancendental meditation, brings the blood pressure down and calms your restless mind. Its not perpetual motion and will not run for hours on a single running session but it can be quite hypnotic to watch."
4,A Global Soundwalk,"Take one day -- February 17, 1996 -- and 36 recordists with 36 different points of view, and locations all over the world (England, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Italy and all over the US) -- collage all of the recordings together, and what do you get?You get a 71-minute, 75 track CD of wind, bird calls, traffic, rain, amusement parks, frogs and the other sounds of everyday life on earth. The results are consistently intriguing, although the editor, Jason Reiner, made no attempt to maintain either geographical relationships or auditory ones. The sounds just fade one-into-the-next seemingly at random -- sometimes jarringly."
3,A LITTLE SLOW,Loved Paul Mooney on Chapelle's Show so bought this without knowing too much about it. Found it a little slow but still entertaining.
2,Needs a history lesson,"Jesus was ethnically Middle-Eastern, Cleopatra was of Macedonian/Greek decent, so no, neither of them were black, but if you are as self-righteous and big-headed as Mooney is, this DVD will at least make you feel very smug."
2,Potential but a bad game all around,This is one of the worst games in the world. The graphics are good but the games is not. The game is not to fun because tried to rate it E. This made them take out to much stuff. That made it a horrible game
5,"GOOD TIMES, GOOD TIMES...","Disney gets it right, again! Great box set and very good price. If you never had the chance to see the first season or you just want to enjoy all the great episodes over again...with out the commercial interruptions, I highly recommend this. Can't wait for the release of season 2 & 3 on DVD."
5,Phil Collins explodes in In The Air Tonight,"After expressing his anger, he finally explodes and lets it all out in In The Air Tonight. The drumming is unbelievable. It is a great sung to get pumped up for a basketball game."
4,"Good, but not perfect","I hate alarm clocks so I thought this one would be more soothing. It is better, but the nature sounds are very strange, not natural at all. The radio sound is fantastic and even the regular buzzer alarm isn't that obnoxious. I do not like the LED time display, it's a bright orange backround with thin black numbers."
2,do NOT buy this clock,"I hate this clock. The speakers [are bad.] They always make an annoying clicky noise, and I didn't just get a defective one. I know two other people who have the same problem. The dimmer switch doesn't really make it dimmer. The nature sounds aren't very natural; they're kind of annoying. The clock may look good here, but it is so much uglier in real life. The three alarms are kind of nice, but the radio reception is really bad. Don't buy this!"
1,A Very Poor Product,"We found the sound to be poor, the ""Nature Sounds"" were more alarming than soothing, and the controls and setup to be so far from intuitive as to be maddening. We are not techno-novices either. In general, we would judge it to be a poor product at any low price."
3,If your into retro...,"These games were definitely faithful to the originals (with options to promptly change them to easier playability). I mostly wanted Centipede which didn't translate well from vertical screen to horizontal. Neither did Tempest, although Asteroids was pretty much the same- was it horizontal in the console? Can't remember. One of the options was to rotate the game 90 degrees but this is impractical for many reasons. The coolest feature was the option to make any one of the games the Theme for your computer (sounds and everything)- at least it was cool for the first half-hour or so. Really wanted MoonLander but not on there. Thx..."
3,Skip this and get the Millennium Edition instead,"I will admit I don't have the millennium edition of this collection, but I bought an earlier version (1999 to be exact), and these games work just as good as they do in the arcade; Microsoft's Arcade (made in 1993) seems cardboard compared to this. If you're thinking about buying THIS collection, you're gonna feel ripped off compared to the millennium edition (or Atari's Greatest Hits 1 and 2). Great games, but I would still recommend you try Volume 2 out. (Crystal Castles, Millipede, and Warlords to name a few.) You may remember them back from the 1980s."
3,Great value on price. You get what you pay for.,"Great Value on item price wise, but you get what you pay for. This item contains several of the original games from Atari 2600. They are nothing compared to recent revised versions of various classics. I wouldn't pay more than 12 dollars for this item."
1,Avoid this Clock!,Don't buy this clock. It does not tell time correctly and the radio reception it horrible!
1,Don't waste your time and money on this course,"After you install and start this application, it will literally shout at you and require you to click on various buttons (such as '?', only to learn that this provides help), as if you have never used a Windows application before. That having been said, it could certainly do more to conform to Windows standards.The linguistic content is very primitive and of arguable value. You just learn words, which in itself can be useful. However, the choice of words is very questionable - I could think of many more useful words than 'raspberry'.The overall presentation, largely based on animations and games, is more suited for toddlers than for adult learners. Every time you give a correct answer, you will get the same complimentary spoken comment like '...YES!'.On a graphic design note, I do not think it is very useful to have a blonde Caucasian woman teach you a language like Malay - she is unlikely to be a native speaker."
2,Difficult to use,"This alarm does its job; however its a job to get it to do so. There is a total of fourteen dials and buttons, with a total of twenty different functions, some of which must be used in tandem. ( a pain! ) The names on the buttons are printed sooooo small they are very difficult to read - lite gray on a black background. To this reviewer simpler is usually better; try another alarm clock."
4,A Really Nice Book,I really enjoyed reading this book and would like to recommend it to others. The author is witty and has a great style of writing and the information was really good too.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM...I BEG YOU,"I have heard of a few people who actual got this product to work and liked it. I can't comment on whether it works well. I can only tell you that most of them don't work at all. Some times on Amazon I read a bad review and think...it won't happen to me. Trust me...give the money to charity...throw it out a window...anything but purchase this item. And when it doesn't work, don't even bother calling jvc.I have never written a review on Amazon, but now I can sleep better at night knowing that anyone who buys one of these cameras gets what they deserve.Hope this helps."
1,Science Fiction Stories,Disappointed when I read the first story. Still undecided if my grandson would enjoy it. Not impressed with the story choices.
2,It's my dream,Thank you edward blishen for collecting all the exciting stories that once attracted me so much.Now I can enjoy them in one book.I hope all the reader can have good dreams when you read this book.
3,"well designed, but I wish it sounded more authentic","this is a fine alarm clock. it has funny nature sounds and alarms (my favorite is the babbling brook). I think the intention is that you put on the nature sound before going to sleep and it will help you sleep. great idea if the ocean sound, for example, didn't remind me of flushing toilets. I mean the sounds are muffled, like they are inside a box. the nature sound loops are short (about ten seconds then it repeats not too noticeably). the forest sound is mostly a bunch of crickets and the occasional hooting owl (if you into that sort of thing). anyways, this is a fine alarm clock in an attractive green package, but if you want to sleep to the sounds of nature, but one of those CDs, or move to the country."
4,kathys choice,"well....i would have to say that this c.d. is very unique, it is own sort of way. and that is what i like, is the creativity and the quality of the rage of instruments. the quality of the cd is good, considering it was done by himself, and done in his own home studio. thanx! :)"
2,Failed to keep me engaged,"There was something about this book that put me to sleep while I was reading it. That's why it took me two weeks to get through it. It's got a good plot to it but the pacing just slayed me. I don't know that I'd read another book by this author even though she's got small town life down to a perfect ""t""."
2,"High on color, low on plot and narrative","My first Caroline Graham, but probably my last. I got half way through this book and then threw it away in frustration.Many American readers will find some problems with the 'Englishness' of this novel (proprietary names of products not available here, contemporary references, etc.)and no doubt others will enjoy it for just that reason.My main problem was that the 'color' was overdone: although there was an excess of detail about the village in which the story is set, and the people who inhabit it, this all came at the expense of any development of the characters. Barnaby is still rather a cardboard cut-out even at the end.The plot is weak, and the narrative is too slow. Sorry, Ms Graham, I really tried hard but this wasn't my cup of tea . . ."
4,complex and twisty mystery,"Although I found the Inspector and Sargeant Troy somewhat one dimensional (the Sargeants' thoughts being almost an unwelcome intrusion), the mystery surrounding the bell-ringers disappearance and the intricacies of its' resolution more than compensated for their lack of amiability. Whereas quite a few village mysteries wind up with barely plausible plots, Faithful Unto Death has as many fascinating twists and turns as an English country road."
4,Good for learning few hundred words,"This program is decent for absolute beginners - just to introduce you to few hundred words. Don't count to be able to communicate in Chinese with this program. You'll learn how to count to twenty, colors, names of some food itesm, clothing items, how to tell time and few basic expressions.What does work for this program is games, which are fun to do and help to retain the information. The program though seems almost better suited for kids than for adults - well, just so you can say you know few words in Chinese."
4,Great Choice,This is a laid-back way to learn Chinese vocabulary. It's good for kids and adults alike.
3,Worms - good old fashion fun *SPLAT*,"Its certainly not brain food, nor does it have many redeeming social values, but it is a fun twist on the old ""Artillery"" games so common years ago. The humor aspect was cute, although replability against the computer suffers, often becoming a matter of who gets the first shot off, and whether you're able to sneak up on the computer before it's calculator brain figures out the right angle, velocity, and wind-speed adjustments to make in order to turn your worm into.. well, worm-food.Altogether a fun little game worth the small cost."
1,Petite grammaire syriaque,"I am learning syraic, and I speek french, for me it's verry important to dicover a syriac grammar in french."
1,WHAT IS THE NAMES OF THE MOVIES?,"I finally bought this set of movies and as I suspected I already have themthey are the same as V1 of Halmark moviessure is dissappointing not to have this informationHERE IS THE NAMES1) Thicker than Water2)The colt3)Ordinary miracles4) Fielders Choicevery good stories so will post my new set for salechfancier""fancier of fine movies"""
5,Excellent,"This edition is as useful as the earlier editions. Besides providing insight on almost all the topics of VLSI, the third edition also addresses several issues related to the sub-micron technology."
4,please read fine print,"you may think ""wiper blades"" what a bargain!please note, while the product name indicates plural, the product description says ""Note: Wiper blades are sold individually""so, unless you want uneven rain coverage on your vehicle, order two.EDIT:they have now changed the product title to ""Wiper Blade"", which is exactly what was delivered. a fine wiper blade. a little pricey for one, though."
3,Okay but not for newer computers,"This game will not work on my laptop, which runs on Windows 7. You need an older OS to run it."
1,poorly constructed,I found this item to be difficult to use and I wanted to return it. I did not receive instructions in the box for returns. I am very disappointed and do not advise buying from this company.
4,Get this!!!!,Oh if you like Sci-Fi then buy this. I'd also reccomend the world of Narue. If you don't know what even is just get it. Theres descriptions for it though. ^___^
4,Hang in there,"If you have trouble getting into this new cat series, my suggestion would be to hang in there. Having read all the dog lovers books, but being a cat person, I was eager to read Scratch the Surface. At page 5, I was ready to give it up, but kept reading. At page 10, I thought someone other than Susan Conant had written this as it wasn't anything like the other series. Fortunately I kept going and ended up enjoying it. I agree with other reviewers that Felicity Pride isn't very likeable but I think there's room for growth of the character. So... I will look forward to the next book in this series, even though the dog lovers mysteries are by far my favorite."
4,Blurb for Dr John Cobin's _Pro-Life Policy_,"In this volume, John Cobin persuasively illustrates that the pro-life position is essentially liberal, from both economic and philosophical perspectives. The exposition is clear and simple and the many appendices make this work suitable for use in the classroom as well. Dr. Cobin was instrumental in refining my thinking on this subject and his book is highly recommended."
2,Mostly solo performances,"I expected the close harmony blending of MT. This collection is mostly solos. They are somewhat interesting, but I was disappointed. ""Scoth & Soda"" and ""Poinciana"" are keepers; the rest I'll ignore.The collection of recordings in other CDs, e.g. ""Swing"" far surpass this collection in terms of group participation."
4,Pretty Good Compilation,"I bought this CD set last year...when it was released...Well I would say it is one of the best compilations MOS USA has to offer...Disc 1 contains some of the best hits of the summer of 2005 which are ""Listen To Your Heart"" ""Put 'Em High"" ""Star To Fall"" ""Feel The Vibe"" ""I See Girls"" ""Shivers"" & ""Sunrise""...pretty good tracks representing relatively good House/Dance/Trance...Disc 2 goes a little cheesey...i didn't like it at much...but some songs are pretty good such as ""Pump Up The Jam"" ""Into Your Eyes"" ""Still Not Sorry"" ""Summer Moon"" & ""The Loves We Lost""...I just think that the selection of songs is pretty good compared to what other ultrarecords CD's offer..."
1,"Unlikeable characters, predictable plot","I tried to read this book, I really did, but after three weeks of reading a page or two and then completely losing interest, I finally gave up. I ended up just skimming it to make sure I didn't miss any twists, I didn't. I figured out the whole mystery around chapter 2 and never found anything likeable about the characters. If you must read everything Ms. Miller produces, check it out of the library but don't waste money on this one."
3,Interesting scenery descriptions - story kinda slow,"I did like this book as it was set in an unusual and not often traveled part of the world, the Orkney Islands. The story line was about ""medium interesting"" as you didn't completley get into the characters so it was a little hard to be shocked by what happened. Little empathy.All of that said, I am glad I bought the book."
4,The First Serious Hit,"For Phil Collins, he has today came a very, very long way since he started his path to solo stardom. Still, it was absolutely bittersweet from the very beginning. Phil was going through a painful divorce, when he wrote In The Air Tonight. Whatever it was, it became Phil's first Top 20 hit, and locked Phil Collins in as a force beyond Genesis. Although it was edited down here, and not the full-length version from Hits and Face Value, it still is just as haunting and surprising as you'd expect from Phil. Still, it is just a shame that people don't respect Phil Collins now, like they used to back in the 1980's. Still, you can't help but enjoy his music."
3,Prine's songs are great. CD seems defective on certain titles.,I love the John Prine CD-- through about half the songs then it begins to skip and repeat. Doesn't look scratched and it has played this way since arrival.
1,Possible Fire Hazard,I had this monitor and it started to make a loud noise one night and I could smell a strong odor of copper wire burning eminating from it. The screen was black on the sides and white down the middle. When I hit the mouse to clear the screen and it started to make a shrill sound and I just pulled the plug. I had this for less than a year. If your kids have this in their room please take care. I'm the only one that used this.
4,Entertaining read,"I discovered this very good non fiction book, because I am reading books by H Paul Jeffers. Book details cases that Ken Gribetz prosecuted both in Rockland County (a NYC Suburb ) and in NYC, under the legendary Frank Hogan. One of the cases is a Brinks robbery that was probably the basis for a ""Law and Order"" epsiode, featuring William Kunstler. I don't think Kunstler was involved in the Brinks robbery defense, but he does appear in the book. Cases are varied from murder of parents to a Homosexual murder. The cases are very easy to read about. There aren't any ""legalese"" distractions.These cases fare very favorably against Ann Rule's True Crime files, which I consider to be high praise."
3,For Stills' Fans Only,"This is an album that received poor reviews when it was released. For the most part I agree. It doesn't begin to capture the energy that Stills displays during his concerts. In addition, the recording mix (at least on the original LP) was mediocre. The vocals are too weak, and certain instruments, especially the keyboards, are too pronounced. I also think the tempo of many of the songs is too quick which gives them a 'rushed' feel. Nonetheless, this recording does provide a glimpse of a performer, who at his best, is as good as anyone in the business."
3,My lightsaber is bent,"Batteries not included and when extended, it was bent! I still enjoyed waiving it around in public though. But be careful, some women don't like it when you get reckless with a lightsaber."
3,Not bad,"This lightsaber toy is basically what you would expect it to be. It's very detailed and cool looking. My only problem with it is that the handle is much lighter in weight than other similar lightsaber toys. This makes it feel somewhat ""cheap"" and does not allow for a sturdy feel when handling it in a play-fighting manner. Mind you, when I say this I am not compairing it to the higher quality lightsaber toys that run in the $20 price range. I am comparing it to the other lightsabers within its price range. So basically, even compared to the other lightsabers in its class, this one feels very low-grade. But that being said, it's still pretty cool. Unless you are really into actively playing with the toy, pretending to do fast jedi style fighting, you might not mind the not-so-sturdy feel of it."
3,"FOR A COSTUME, IT'S OKAY . . .","If you are just looking for something to complete your Darth Vader costume for one Halloween night, this is an excellent choice. However, if you are looking to purchase a light saber as a play toy for your active child . . . don't spend the money. This is cheaply made. The ""sword"" arrived bent. Just two good whacks from your child and the toy will be broken. You're better off finding a sword from a dollar store they can bang around or spending some serious cash on a sturdier one."
4,I love this game!,"I love this non-violent 3d action shooter! I can't stop playing it! I recomend you get this for your children because it's clean, non-gory, quake3 action!"
2,Not very long lasting,"At first glance, I really liked this eyeliner - the black is very dark and glossy and although I generally prefer marker type liquid eyeliners, the brush was fairly easy to use.But the eyeliner creases like crazy! Sometimes within 15 minutes it will be all creased. Other times it lasts longer if I used a heavier line, but it definitely won't last longer than a couple of hours. If you rub your eyes, it won't smudge, but will completely flake off.My eyes aren't particularly sensitive, so I think I'll stick to other truly long wearing brands going forward."
4,Blinc Kiss Me Eyeliner,"This does stay on much better than most eyeliners. It is a harsher, 1990's look rather than a light accent. It does not smear to soften. However,if you are looking for staying power this eyeliner has it."
5,Love this Blue Waterproof Eyeliner!,"I have been looking for a pretty blue waterproof eyeliner (not navy) for years and I finally found it! I love this stuff. It lasts all day and comes off easily. No smudging or flaking off! The brush is perfect for drawing a very fine line above your lashes or under the bottom eyelashes. It goes on smoothly with no mistakes. It's so easy to put on, I highly recommend it. And the blue is a great color. I wish it wasn't as expensive as it is, but it's definately worth it because it's exactly what I wanted. I'm tired of using black all the time - how boring! I've gotten so many compliments on my eyes since I've been using the blue eyeliner. I hope they never stop making this."
3,Good Overview For All and Yet Lacking...,"Kaiser's work is a useful tool for anyone who wants to study the Old Testament seriously, whether they are a layperson or someone who is doing so for a living. It is well written and easy to understand, yet has enough meat in it to keep those satisfied who think they know the first two-thirds of the Bible by heart. While it is an enjoyable and good resource, I wouldn't use it on its own, simply because having more sources to corellate facts is good (it also fosters positively critical thinking). If you use this book, don't forget to have another one like Eugene Merill's ""Kingdom of Priests"" along with it."
5,Great Resource for the Council of Chalcedon,"This book was very readable and informative. It went into great detail, giving a blow by blow analysis of everything that happened at the council. It also gave a detailed account and analysis of the events and desputes leading up to the council, as well as the aftermath. The book was written by a non-chalcedonian author, but he addresses the issues without being polemical or contentious. His writing style is very accessible. It has been a long time since I have read a book which was at once this enjoyable and informative. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in this subject."
5,"The Good, The Ok and The Ok.","CD 2 & 3 are the oks. However, if it were possible to wear down a cd, I would have done it with CD 1. It is 78 minutes and 29 seconds of ingenius intense trance music. Try getting that much value for your money from some regular rock n roll band like Van Halen. This triple CD is expensive, but CD 1 is worth the price alone. If I could only take 5 cds with me to a deserted island for the rest of my life, CD 1 would be one of them. Well, I think you get the point."
5,Wonderful!!,"This book is a super autobiographical story of the greatest legend in country music. He tells his life story in much the way that he writes songs, relaxed, heart-felt, and very honest. This book is a page-turner and a must have! I only wish I could get it autographed."
1,"This is not your father's Missile Command, unfortunately.","This new updated version of the arcade classic is a huge dissappointment. Its look and feel is more of ""space invaders"" than of missile command. Basiclly this game suffers from inappropriate use of 3-D effects and even worse player control. Anyone who loved the original will see this as a missed opportunity by Atari."
3,help,I hope someone reads this - All I want to know is how the hell to order anything in Australia when everything I look at or want is only shipped in the USA. Are you just waisting my time? I clicked on contact us a dozen times & went round in circles.
4,a neglected classic,"This is a great album. It's a shame it's been allowed to go out of print. Songs of yearning like ""Thing About You"" and ""Apple Pie"" are perfect for Fracasso's dreamy, wistful voice. And ""Love and Trust"" and ""Girl From Ohio"" are full of the little descriptive touches that make for great songwriting (""Flagging down strangers who might help/Feeling like a stranger to herself""). If you are a fan of Lucinda, Gillian, and John Hiatt or Prine, find this disc and buy it."
5,A True Classic,"Nearly a decade after its release, this out-of-print disc by this unjustifiably obscure artist remains one of my all-time favorites. I might describe the sound as Dylan-meets-Jimmie Dale Gilmore-meets-Buddy Holly, but that doesn't really do it justice. I would place this CD in a class with truly brilliant records like Dylan's ""Blood on the Tracks"" or Emmylou Harris' ""Wrecking Ball."" If you are looking for something great that you have never heard before, I urge you to seek out this CD."
1,Worked great for awhile,"When I bought this clock I loved it, the clocks lite-up, with adjustable brightness, the alarms (I chose bells) were great, I loved the fade-up alarm feature. But first the face clock stopped then the light went out, then the snooze feature works intermittently (my wife loves this when it goes of ten minutes after I've left the building). Now the alarm just doesn't work dependably enough to use it at all. I was just looking for a new alarm clock when I saw this and decided to write a review. I may have just got a lemon. My last alarm clock lasted for almost eight years, so I don't think I abuse my alarms."
2,"Looks good, not functional.","My husband hated this clock! I bought it for him for Christmas, and he had a helluva time trying to figure out how to work it. After the first three nights, we added another clock to the bedside table and he has been using the 'old' one ever since. Today I'm listing it on eBay."
1,NOT THE ITEM I RECEIVED,"GREAT PRINTER IF YOU GET THE LAST MODELS!!!!NOT THE ITEM I RECEIVED I have had at least five of these GREAT Epson printers. The model I received was perhaps the first one ever made...no features, no red-eye out, no visual on the screen....a complete waste of money. Mispresented, However, the wonderful people at AMAZON credited my account to my complete surprise and satisfaction. Thank you!!! Steve"
5,Officer Buckle & Gloria,"I highly recommend anything written by Peggy Rathman. A great story, delightfully illustrated. Adults who have the pleasure of reading this and her other books will enjoy seeing ""easter egg"" connections to them all."
4,Always Stick With Your Buddy ... :),"My son (29 months) made me read this to him every night, sometimes twice, for a fortnight. Nice book, gentle humour and great message."
3,Great story!,The receipt and what I thought I was getting said NEW. When I open the package it was a USED book. My niece was a little disappointed. I do have to say the story is really cute. I do recommened the book for all kids to read.
2,Caldecott Selection Puzzling,I brought this book to my two older children (4 and 3) with great expectation. The illustrations and story line was mildly entertaining. This was my first disappointment with a Caldecott book and could find nothing that would merit the award. Not for everyone.
5,Fantastic story!,We LOVE this story. We received it as a gift and have read it countless times - never boring! Our 11 year old still loves it and she got it when she was 3 years old!
3,I don't want one,"I housesit for a lady who has this alarm clock. The creek sounds okay, but I never set it to ""Birds of Paradise"". It sounds like a war on Animal Farm. Otherwise, it works great and is very easy to use."
1,very small heads,The heads of these applicators (q-tips) are very small and therefor useless for most medical applications. It is difficult to tell this from photos and not mentioned in the copy.
5,What can I say?,"If you saw the movie then you either hated it or you are now a confirmed Baz Lurman fan and you have to have the sound track. What could be simpler? Just buy it now and get it over with, unless you are a masochist - in which case, wallow in the pain of denying yourself for another five minutes and then order it."
2,NOT a Real Soundtrack!,"Hmmm....aren't soundtracks supposed to be the tracks off the movie.....these aren't exactly what we heard....On top of it, the best songs are missing from the CD, we were so robbed! You know the money hungry bastards are doing this so they will make another CD and we will fork over more money... its BS, but we buy it....ANYWAY, it was a great GREAT movie, but a lousy or dissapointing ""soundtrack""."
5,amazing CD,"I got the soundtrack before I saw the movie and absolutely fell in love with it. I've put the CD on repeat and listen to it three or four times a day practically. Usually I'd get sick of a CD, but this has so many different kinds of songs on it that it's impossible to not love it. If you liked the movie you'll love the soundtrack and if you didn't see the movie you still probably will. ""Your Song"" and ""Come What May"" are the best gushy love songs. I think it's awesome that Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor actually sang. They did an amazing job."
4,"I haven't seen the movie, but I did get the cd","I found Moulin Rouge to be a very unique and fun cd. Lady Marmelade, Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, and Come What May are my favorite tracks. Nicole Kidman really sings well! She could be on Broadway, I have every faith! Anyhow, it's nothing less than fun. I liked it."
5,"Bow down and hail to the king, baby!","This CD will toss you, spin you and turn you 360! This is an incredibly powerful mixture of musical genres interspersing one another with a rollercoaster speed. From uptempo ""Lady Marmalade"" to smooth ballad ""Come What May"" you cannot resist this magical, spell-binding avantgarde.My personal favorites include the above-mentioned ""Come What May"" as well as ""Your Song"" (a remix of Elton John's old hit) ""Elephant Love Medley"" and ""Le Tango de Roxanne"". The rest is only stunning. :-) Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they actually _can_ sing very well.Buy it and cherish it!"
2,Lady Marmalade Only Good Song,"Lady Marmalade Is The only good song on this album by the way the original version of the song is horrible Im glad they remade it because it sounds a lot better. However it resembles En Vogues ""Free Your Mind."" Other than that this is not worth getting just try to get the song somewhere else."
5,Moulin Rouge Rocks Review,"Honestly, this is my favorite CD. It is a mix of all of the classic love songs. You can't listen to this CD and not pick up a song that you do not recognize. With its vibrant beats and familiar choruses, this soundtrack is addictive. I know my CD is so beat up from its constant use. Although it is missing a few favorites from the movie, such as Like A Virgin, The Sound of Music, and Spectacular Spectacular, it still is an amazing soundtrack that adds a new twist to old songs and keeps you coming back for more."
4,great,"i just got this cd 5 days a go and i can't stop listening to it. There is a lot of remakes on the cd, but they are done so well, this is not a second-rate cd, it's done with taste. I have to say that my favorite song is Complainte de la Butte, but that's because i like Rufus Wainwright's accent."
4,I had to review again...,"My first review didn't quite do the soundtrack justice. I have listened to the whole thing several times, except for ""Children of the Revolution,"" ""Nature Boy,"" and ""Diamond Dogs,"" which I think were wastes of space.The soundtrack is magical, and I look forward to the other CDs. I think they should have arranged the set by the order of songs in the movie, with Nature Boy first, the Can-Can, etc. etc. That would have been more sensible.Roxanne gives me chills. Complainte de la Butte (when was this in the movie, praytell?) is an awesome song, tho I have no clue what it means. Elephant Love Medley, Sparkling Diamond, Lady Marmalade, Come What May, Your Song, and Hindi Sad Diamonds are my other favorite tracks. I'm eagerly awaiting the next CDs."
3,15 Songs in Search of a Movie,"Good news first: Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have no problem selling soundtrack ballads and music hall confections. Both have pleasant voices, and enough acting chops to get these songs over on character alone. For his part, McGregor shines on his on Elton John's ""Your Song"". The rest of the CD is heavy slogging though crazy medleys (""Sparkling Diamonds"") and misguided remakes (Beck's kitchen-sink version of ""Diamond Dogs"" makes an already difficult song near impenetrable). There are highlights, however: ""Lady Marmalade"" is impossible to destroy, and Christina Aguilera, et al, do the song proud; Rufus Wainwright's simple piano ballad ""Complainte de la Butte"" is an oasis in the midst of chaos, and ""Hindi Sad Diamonds"" is a Bollywood musical set to heavy metal. As it stands, though, the collection is schizophrenic -- maybe the film will give these songs their proper meaning and context."
5,Completely Impressed,"I was eagerly awaiting this CD, as the trailer's lush use of visual led me to believe the audio would also be lush. It IS. Hindi Diamond remix is a whole mess of fun. As with many trailers, the songs are often not included in the film or the soundtrack. You will NOT be disappointed. I did hear that Ozzy Osborne did a song for the movie that does not appear in the soundtrack, but that's okay. The rest of songs match the breathtaking vision of the film. Buy the CD, it is well worth the money."
3,Tolerable not Horrible,"I'm very open to new types of music and films. When I first saw Moulin Rouge, it had wonderful music. It wasn't what I expected and I was blown away. Buuuuut this cd that I purchased didn't contain all the music that I had hoped for. The first cd had a majority of the good songs but the second one had the minority. Total waste of money. Still, I liked some of the music but I felt cheated when they didn't include some of the others. I wouldn't say that I'm not fully disappointed but I am. Guess I should of stuck with Andrew Lloyd Webber. U_U"
2,Moulin Rouge [SOUNDTRACK],"I was really disappointed in the soundtrack. I absolutely love the song by Christina, Pink, Mya and Lil' Kim but the rest of the CD is a waste in my opinion. Granted, I have NOT seen the movie and maybe if I had, I would be more impressed by the CD. But, it just isn't ""my kinda music"". There ARE a couple of decent songs on the soundtrack CD but most are not. Of course, the best one is the title song by those four terrific singers! If I would have known the rest of this CD was what it is, I would have saved my [price]!"
2,not a good soundtrack,"First,some songs from the movie disappeared, like ""like a virgin"",""The show must go on"" ...Second,Nicole doesn't sing well.She is an actress,not a singer.Ewan is not bad,though not very good.2 stars for ""Nature Boy"" and ""Le Tango de Roxanne"""
4,Fantastic!,This soundtrack has not left my cd player since I bought it. I loved the movie and I love the soudntrack. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is becuase it didn't have all the songs from the movie.
4,come what may,"I just recently saw the movie, and it was ""spectacular, spectaular"". The songs in the movie were great, so naturally i went to the store to buy the soundtrack. I was surprised that ""Like A Virgin"" was not included, as well as the Sound of Music parody (the hills are alive...). What also struck me as odd was that they included some songs that weren't really in the movie. The songs from the movie that were included were great though. So don't get me wrong, I think the soundtrack is very very good, but it cannot be the complete five stars because of what is lacking. All in all, if you don't mind that some songs are missing, you should definitely go out and buy this soundtrack. The Elephant Love Medley is the most hilarious batch of songs, and McGregor and Kidman have quite good voices."
5,**Wow**,This is one of the Best musicals there is. I hope to see it on Broadway someday! I love the music and the way it went well together. Nicoal Kidman can sing very well... i would love to hear more from her too. I was blowin away by this movies/musical... The album as a mix of everything... From rap to classical stuff. It is all around wonderful. I mean a musical done w/ music of my time. Its great. I think everyone one should have this album. Go buy it :)
1,not the soundtrack of the movie!,"I bought this CD expecting the soundtrack of the actual movie. (Crazy idea, I know.) Isn't that what a soundtrack is? This is not the movie soundtrack.And I am furious and disappointed that it is not what it says it is."
4,Oops,"There's an error on Amazon's song list. The first track should be ""Nature Boy,"" sung by David Bowie. The song, in different versions, by the same artist, opens and closes this colorful, eclectic series of songs. Forget about the styles of music - this CD is for anybody who enjoys imaginative, playful, and sometimes thoughtful covers and medleys of songs many of us know very well. (Beck's cover of David Bowie's ""Diamond Dogs"" might just be better than Bowie's original. Sorry, Mr. Halloween Jack.) And, yeah, ""Lady Marmalade"" is on the CD, but ironically it's the odd-ball-out since the producer(s) and singers merely mimicked Ms. LaBelle's winning style. (A few seconds of rap isn't that amazing these days.) Hope the movie is an entertaining as the CD."
1,The worst book I've ever read.,"I believed a review that this book was brilliant. The characters are completely unlikeable and it didn't take long for me to wish I had never started reading it. I finished it only because I kept thinking that surely it would ""get better"" after all the reviews praised it so highly. It doesn't. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Quick Chopper Grinder Makes Work Easy,"Chopping, blending and grinding are a natural a part of good cooking. I am not a world class chef who can do everything as quick and neat with a sharp knife as the guys on television shows. I can use this tool from Cuisinart to prepare dishes like those chefs. I just take it out of the drawer and presto, I am finished with it quick as a snap. A quick clean up and it is ready to use again. Every kitchen should have one. It isn't bad for mixing drinks either!"
3,Some nice features but just OK,"I'm new to stick blenders so maybe I don't appreciate a ""good thing"" when I see it but I'm just not overly impressed with this item and am taking mine back to the store. I like the extendable shaft idea (although mine didn't lock into place as they said it should) and the chopper worked well. But I'm pretty under-impressed with the blender/whipper. I tried whipping some egg whites and ended up pulling out my regular blender to do the job right.I also found that trying to control the power with my thumb was extremely uncomfortable and unnatural.I'm going to try the Braun. Not sure if I'll like it better or not.PS - I got the Braun MR5550MBC-HC and love it. It costs more but it does more and works much better and is easier to hold."
1,w0w... this [stinks],"""w0w... this ..."" is the first thing that comes to mind when you use this printer. The first time I brought it home, i thought, NICE a COLOR printer. Little did I know, this color printer is the most likely to be nominated piece of ... THe first time i printed something it worked really well. But after maybe 3 uses, the color scratched off and lines started to appear. The printer is flimsy and cheap looking. If you wanted to (which is not a bad idea) you could break it easily. The cartridges cost too much and after a while the printer messes up all the ink and never again prints with color. People, people, look at this, does this sound like something you want in your home? Put this ... where it belongs, in your dumpster. :)"
2,Not a good buy!,"I have had this printer for a little over a year, and now the printing quality is not good at all. There are new cartridges in there, but the work it prints is not acceptable at all."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I got this printer with my computer as a package deal from SEARS & ROEBUCKS....Which was my first big mistake...The printer didn't work properly the forst time I used it, so I went back to SEARS, and they as much told me to see COMPAQ.....They should have given me a new printer and sent the printer back themselves...........SO I GIVE THE COMPAQ IJ600 a -1 from a score from 1 to 10"
5,More than met my expectations,"I was a little hesitant after reading a review that said another persons CD player didn't work, but at this price I thought I'd take a chance. Mine works perfectly. I checked out 4 or 5 with similar features at a Fry's and this one was my favorite of the group and at Fry's they were all about twice this price. The feature I like best is that you have 12 FM presets and it lets you go to sleep listening to one station and will wake you up to another one and another volume. I'm very happy with it."
4,"handy, solid, and easy to clean","these three things best embody what is great about Cuisinart's hand blender. It's great for small amounts of blended coulis or spreads and sauces like pesto. It also performs great when you plunk it right in your soup pot to smooth things out a bit. If you're looking for a hand-held blender, this one seems the obvious choice to me - especially since the market for cordless implements like this is limited. After all, it IS a Cuisinart. Enjoy."
3,Too easy,"This was too easy for my ten year old nephew. We had more fun with the robot can (same company). All in all, fun gift."
5,My all-time favorite cookbook for special occasions,"This cookbook is, by far, the most influential book in my life of baking! I bought it shortly before my wedding a couple of years ago, and I was able to use several recipes for wedding events! For instance, I made the poppyseed cake with raspberry cream icing for my bridesmaids' luncheon, complete with the traditional ""cake charms"" for the perfect pink cake! I was asked by four people for the recipe, and in fact, I made it again when I gave a good friend her bridal luncheon last June! For my wedding reception, one of my own contributions to the reception table was the lavender shortbread. A truly interesting myriad of flavors, of course, but it got rave reviews! (""What in the world is IN these cookies?"") Five stars!"
5,I see why Gayle's is famous!!,"The intro to the book states ""an entire pastry shop between two covers"", and that is the best way to sum up the book. Thank you Gayle for sharing a well written treasure trove of baking information. One of the best laid out formats, easy to understand delicious recipes, with cross references for each particular recipe. Good illustrations. Not for a beginner, but for myself, a novice, who has only attemped puff pastry one other time, I had excellent results following her instructions. This book is worth it's weight in gold."
2,"Low quality, short lifespan","Low light image is sub standard, but what can you expect for the price. Sadly the CCD blew up 30 days after 1 year warranty expired. It will be cheaper to replace than fix.I'm not buying another JVC to be sure!"
1,too smashed to use,"It was with great excitement and a longer than usual wait that I received this unit. Unfortunately, although the packaging was in perfect condition, one side was smashed. I would have installed it anyway because the indentions were on the part that would be outside, but it was so mutilated that the mountings were totally out of alignment. The most frustrating thing was that the outer and inner packaging was fine, so obviously the packers knew that this unit was a smash and dent and sent it anyway. There is no way to speak to a human which I also found frustrating."
3,Frigidaire A/C,"All is usually good when ordering from Amazon, except this time when the box arrived it had a dent in the side. The A/C unit was also slightly dented, and when we reported it, it was a big deal to be home for UPS to meet and see it, etc. We waited twice (they were late) and missed them a third time. Kind of a big hassle, so we just pried the dent out and it seems to be working fine. Hope the warranty is not voided...???Otherwise all's good... :)"
3,Average at best,"It does what it is supposed to do, which is cool a room. It does have a hard time maintaining a temperature below 70 degrees when it is above 90 degrees outside, even if you set the temperature for 68 or below. I purchased a Haier three years ago and was told afterward that they aren't very good or reliable, but not only is the Haier still going strong, but it outperforms this Frigidaire easily AND is quieter and quicker at cooling a room. Both are 5000 BTU and both claim to cool a room of approximately 150 sq. ft. The difference is the Haier does it all the way down to 65 degrees if that is your liking and the Frigidaire doesn't. Pass on this one and buy yourself a Haier."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Fred Astaire and Betty Hutton team up for this ""good, but not great"" type of movie. On the positive side, Astaire and Hutton are energetic and delightful as a pair of former lovers trying to keep Hutton's son out of the hands of his great-grandmother.The supporting cast is fine, and the script is both witty and moving at the same time. However, this film has one fatel flaw that has kept it from becoming better known. The songs and dances just aren't that good. AND THIS IS A MUSICAL! Astaire is alright during ""Jack and the Beanstock"" and the ""Piano Dance,"" but it's not comparable to his work in ""Swing Time"" or ""Funny Face."" The rest of the songs and dances are just awful, strange, since this material was done by the usualy reliable Frank Loesser. All in all, this movie can entertain an audience, but never make them stand up and say: ""Wow, that was fantastic."" And that is the difference between a good movie and a great one."
1,Pastel Journal,I have NOT received my Journal yet.Can you please check what happened and let me know.Thank you very much.Lili Early
4,An Intro to the Astronauts,"For those who only know the Astronauts by their hit, ""Baja"", this is a good sampler of what their music sounds like when it's not ""Baja"". Known as a great surf instrumental group, they were actually a vocal group recruited by RCA to fill in a void in their recording artist lineup when surf music broke big in the early 60's. This cd takes various songs from their eight RCA albums including tunes that were not released on any of the RCA albums (""Hot Dogging"", ""Main Title from 'Ride The Wild Surf"". So, either you'll be thrilled to hear how well rounded they are vocally and instrumentally or you'll be disappointed to find out that they were not a premier surf instrumental band."
1,100% Junk,These are absolute junk. I paid $250 for them at Sam's 6 months ago for Christmas. I used one only and it started skipping and then freezing and then finally it stopped working all together. It wouldn't read a DVD at all. So we used the other one. It lasted about 2 hours into a trip and then it started doing the same thing. It was a complete waste of money. I highly recommend getting them from a different manufacturer.
4,Magno's review,"The President's Murderer by Jennifer Basset, is a book of action from the start to the end. Jennifer as a official writer for Oxford, spares no danger and adventure in this plot it a book directed to people who are learning English as a second language, ideal for beginners because it has a great story with few words. Dinon Alex, the main character is accused of murdering the old president, a crime he did not commit. Then begins an endless trail of life and death, encountering many obstacles that must be faced to get out alive."
1,"Wrong Tracks, Amazon!",I once owned this great album on vinyl. The description on Amazon looks great -- everything one would want from a Spinners CD. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found a completely different CD than the one pictured and advertised online (even though the product codes match exactly). I sent the CD back to Amazon (no problem) but I'm disappointed Amazon still has it listed incorrectly online more than a year later.
1,Retief gets burnout,"The Retief stories by Laumer are for the most part light-hearted, fast-paced fun reads. ""Retief and the Rascals"" is none of the above. My only explanation is that Laumer was under pressure to produce another Retief story, and was forced to write this one while suffering acute dyspepsia."
2,Not Too Helpful,"Not nearly as interesting as ""The Worst Rock Records"" mainly because singing someone's praises is less interesting than ripping them to shreds. Whereas the ""Worst"" book was clever, funny, and offered true insight, Gutermann's biases don't work so well here. There's a lot of bootlegs listed to represent the best work of particular artists - Dylan's ""Ten of Swords"", Elvis's ""Burbank Sessions"" among them - which is fine for rock completists but not too helpful for the causal fan. Mr. Guterman should go back to slicing and dicing, puffing up isn't his particular skill."
3,A Curious Sense Of Detachment,"Maxine Sullivan hit on a winning formula with her recording of ""Loch Lomond"" and often returned to traditional sources for material, many of which are included in the 100 tracks on offer here, spanning almost 20 years. Her voice was a delicate instrument, but her faithfulness to the lyric and the tune cannot be faulted. Those familiar with her recordings will know already that she sang with a curious sense of detachment. That distinguished her from the competition, but did not always produce a compelling performance. Furthermore, a few of the tracks contain audible surface noise. Against that, her accompaniments included the orchestras of Claude Thornhill, John Kirby, Benny Carter, and Teddy Wilson, and the 32-page booklet includes an informed commentary by Joop Visser, together with a full discography."
5,Love this series of shows,"Very pleased with the product, fast shipping and low cost. Glad my kids are getting to experience the same cartoons that we enjoyed when we were kids."
5,"Sophisticated, ethereal, and powerful -all at the same time!","I was a freshman in graduate school when my assingned roommate was out of the dorm room. We had carte blanche on each other's albums. I never heard of Ponty, but the album cover looked really cool, so I gave it a shot. Wow! I couldn't believe it! I had to hear it again, this time at maximum crank. That bass and synthesizer kick-in near the beginning of the title track is the most powerful I've ever heard, even to this day. This album is so well- engineered, you'd never believe it's from the 70's. I'll never forget the pounding on my dorm door and the yelling from the hallway before the dorm manager chewed me out big time about never playing anything that loud again (it's a true story.) So that was my intro to becoming a Pontyfile, and I now have most of the Ponty albums on both vinyl and disk. Believe it or not, Cosmic Messenger is not my favorite Ponty album, but that doesn't make it any less stupendous. It's unreal."
5,Classic Luc-Ponty,I've been a Jean Luc-Ponty fanactic for years this one was one that started it all. The runs on Fake Paradise are unreal. If you'er a jazz volinist lover this one is a got to have!
1,SAMSUNG SPP2040 PHOTO PRINTER,"RECEVIED PTINTER HAD NO POWER CORD I HAD ONE WOULD NOT FEED PAPER OR PRINT I THREW IN DUMSTER WITH FAULTY RIBBONS I BOUGHT I AM EIGHTY FIVE YRS OLD GOT PISSED AND COULD NOT HANDLE SITUATION THANKS FOR NOTHING PHIL,"
2,poor time keeping,"I really like the watch.The problem i have is that the watch runs aprox 2 minutes fast a week.I contacted customer service and they told me,""that's no problem all automatic mechanical watches have this problem.I was a watchmaker in the 50s and 60s,and I know better.I will not recomend stuhrling products to anyone in the future."
4,On the Road with Bella & Eddie,"This book is alternatingly heart-warming and frustrating, but isn't that life? Bella is a beautiful earth mother to whom Eddie is attracted like no other. Her drug-induced behaviors lead them to split, but he carries a torch for her. The book has some interesting levels to it. Eddie is raised with an insensitive father who refers to him a ""numb nuts,"" gets spirituality from a New Age conquest, and then rejects God altogether. Bella goes through a series of relationships, and eventually pulls her life together. This is a wonderful episodic adventure. The book gives you the feeling that we are on a life path whether or not we are aware of it. It is a great tale recognizing that sometimes it takes time to pull your life together. Enjoy this one. It's a fast fun read!"
3,more projects less process,This book is mostly about various projects to make and not much about the process of making chenille. I was looking more about the technique then just a few specific projects...that were not so much to my tastes.
5,The Wright Biography!,"For anyone really interested in the story of human flight, Tom Crouch's ""The Bishop's Boys"" is the book for you. Crouch has done a masterful job of telling the Wright's story, and what a story it is! Most legendary figures of history crumble when their lives are examined-- Wilbur and Orivlle Wright are more amazing the more you learn about them. Thanks to Crouch and ""The Bishop's Boys"", the entire story, warts and all, is finally put before the public in a well written, definitive, biography. I have studied and written about the Wright Brothers for years, and I always tell anyone who wants to learn more about these amazing brothers to read this book."
3,"Some useful information, but out-of-date.","Some useful information, but out-of-date. For example, it has makes no mention of dry-powder inhalers or fluticasone. Nor does it mention the relationship of asthma and GERD. It may have been good at its time, but I recommend finding a newer book."
5,Great album,Great album but not as great as the original lineup in Led Zeppelin so don't expect it to be. But I do love Jimmy Pages guitar playing and Plants vocals on this album. Highly recommend it to Zep fans.
3,Insufficient,"Sure, these are fine songs, but a nine-track compilation really doesn't do justice to the J. Geils Band, and the song selection isn't even as good as it could have been.If you really only want one J. Geils-album on your shelf, go for the excellent double-disc anthology ""Houseparty"", which picks from the band's entire career, encompassing both their early R&B-styled boogie-rock and their latter-day mainstream rock.Or if you just want a taste, pick up ""The Morning After"" or ""Bloodshot"". This brief collection is neither here nor there."
5,Hold on to your hat Dorthy,"The Wave series is one mind expanding read, I could not put the books down until I had finished them all. When I first became serious about learning about metaphysical issues I was lucky to stumble upon Mrs Jadczyk work, with the help of the Cassiopaeans transmissions she is able to weave together many subjects into a beautiful mosaic that is the foundation esoteric thought. If one has an open mind I highly recommend the Wave series!"
5,One Book that isolates truth from new ages Lies,"Must read for new age people who lost in theories like photon belt. one of the nice books that links science, esotericism,human history accepted/unexplained ,hyper dimensions,channeling, UFO's and its alleged symptoms, human understanding . No nonsense book , easy to read book, Nicely narrated with lots of mind blowing concepts."
5,Excellent first album by American Celtic Band,"This album blends traditional tunes with numerous new compositions written in the traditional style. The band is a three piece that features the vocals of Bekki Titchner, the rock-solid guitaring of Mark Titchner and the many faceted, Paul Fehrenbach.The new works are wonderful and the traditional pieces are delivered with an appropriate combination of reverence and joy.I look forward to their next effort."
2,New York Minglewood blues,The New York Giants baseball team wore a black cap with an orange NY and the Brooklyn Dodgers wore a Royal Blue cap with a white B on it. The original Mets caps were Brooklyn Dodgers blue with the New York Giants orange NY. I bought this cap for my brother David Jordan because both of our maternal Grandparents were from New York City and we are both from Philly so I bought it for BET protection from the Philadelphia Italians.
3,"Not bad, but maybe you need to start somewhere else....","Im a pretty big Cooper fan but since picking it up, I listen to it more and more althoughthe first time I heard it I thought, ""ugh, I miss his old band"". I still kind of do.Im not a big fan of concept albums. Years Ago and Steven remind me of something Kiss did on The Elder. Its not that great. The best songs are Devils Food, Black Widow, Cold Ethyl and Escape. The rest you could do without. But, its still pretty good. Im sure I'll really appreciate it once I hear ""Goes To Hell"" which I havent heard a good thing yet about it. Anyway, go get his first couple of albums."
4,AC's Best Album Overall,"In 1975 Alice sacked the rest of the band and went solo with Welcome To My Nightmare. This was a pretty bold move considering that the original band helped write many of Alice Cooper's classic songs. While this album did not chart as high as 1973's Billion Dollar Babies (#1) it did contain one of Alice's biggest hits, a ballad called Only Woman Bleed. WTMN does not have my all-time favorite AC songs but it's one of the few albums that I really enjoy from beginning to end. My favorite songs are Devils Food (with a classic narration by Vincent Price!), The Black Widow (covered well by Bruce Dickinson), Cold Ethyl (classic lyrics), Years Ago (haunting), and Steven. I also recommend The Best Of Alice Cooper which packs 22 songs on one cd!"
3,Here is a fun diversion from the godfather of shock-rock.,"This was the first album I ever bought, and I loved it. Of course, I was a 14 year old boy at the time. It was fun to revel in the weirdness (""Cold Ethyl"" -- ""She's cool in bed. There she ought to be, cause Ethyl's dead."") But ultimately Alice Cooper was safe, because you knew he didn't take this stuff seriously. Listen for the reference to Donnie Osmond on ""Department of Youth"" or the classic narration by Vincent Price on ""Black Widow."" The biggest hit off this album was ""Only Women Bleed."" The sentiment were probably more appropriate for the man-hating 90's than on this collection but it proved that even Alice Cooper could be politically correct. A few of the tunes were a waste of recording studio time (Steven, Some Folks)but if you have a teen age son whom you can't relate to, give him this CD and and listen to something from his Marilyn Manson collection ... maybe you'll find a connection."
5,A great start,"A great start for the solo career of Alice Cooper. ""Only Women Bleed"" is one of his biggest hits, and for good reason. This album is awesome, and ""Steven"" and ""Some Folks"" are NOT a waste of studio time. I will bet money that the person that wrote that review will not know the reason behind the writing of ""Steven"" and the hidden meaning of it, and that is why they don't like it, they don't understand it. In my opinion, this is one of the best albums of his career."
1,"Wrong choice, my fault","Sorry, I cannot give a better review of this CD because I couldn't stand to listen to more than one or two tracks! My mistake, I know, but when I ordered it I thought I was ordering the CD of COTI, the Argentinean singer, and what I ended up getting was from a German COTI with just""everyday noises"": cars passing, train noises, etc. Maybe they use this as ""background"" sounds, I don't know."
3,"Only want ""Gloria""? There's a solution. . . .","I'm old enough to remember how much airtime ""Gloria"" received when it first came out in the early 1980s. I didn't care much for the next single on Laura Branigan's debut album, and so I never bought it out of wariness.If you're like me and you like ""Gloria"" a lot but not enough to buy the album, take a look at a new compilation CD called ""Lifetime Intimate Portrait: Women in Rock."" It's a selection of hits from most (though not all) of the prominent first generation female rockers. So you get ""Gloria,"" along with songs by the Bangles, Eurythmics, Joan Jett, Scandal, Pat Benatar, and others."
1,Read this only after you have read Hazzard's other books.,"I couldn't finish The Evening of the Holiday. It was Hazzard's first novel, and it shows: immature, boring. It does not capture a sense of place and time as well as the other two Hazzard books I read. To put things in perspective, I gave The Great Fire 4 stars, and would consider The Bay of Noon a 3 star book."
2,Unfortunate at best,"A perfect movie for the Bush era. Gay men aren't really gay, they only think they are: Give 'em a good woman and watch 'em come 'round! Grotesque.Yes yes, I know, you can finesse greater subtlety from the film if you try. But as a gay man myself, guess what? I'm real tired of trying.I give the film two stars only for the excellence of the performance by Cradup. Rupert Everett as King Charles is also fun to watch, though personally I think he should have ordered his own beheading for agreeing to appear in this travesty of faith."
1,Sax case not high density foam,We bought this sax case for our 11 year old and thought that it would be great for him. It has the back pac style straps which are great for carrying. It also has some padding but it it definitely not the high density foam that the item description claims it has. We had to have our sax repaired because the case did not offer any protection for the abuse that a 11 year old can dish out. I would not recommend the case for anyone especially for kids.
4,Cantor's One-man Show Hails Superb at Carnegie Hall!,"Such a unique and charming effort by Eddie Cantor in his latter years as he entertains (and truly captures)his audience single-handedly!Such classic humor and versatility fill the two-hour(or so) recording by Mr. Cantor as he reminisces about show business during the earlier part of the century. Accompanied only by two pianists (Arthur Siegel and George Tibbles), this ""Apostle of Pep"" treats his audience to many tunes he himself immortalized and other songs of long ago! A must for any Cantor fan as well as anyone appreciative of an era that's well worth remembering! That's Taste! That's Talent!That's Entertainment!"
3,Holiday 4 Film Collector's Set Vol 1,Sometimes you purchase the set in order to get the ones you like. You can always gift the ones that you are not particularly crazy about to someone else. I have others that I will be purchasing in the near future. I love good clean movies even if there are not completely reality.
5,Favorite Christmas Collection,"This is a must have for a family's (or individual's) holiday DVD collection. My favorite is Silent Night (I favor true stories), but all four are inspirational and heartwarming. I purchased the Set I have at Best Buy for a very reasonable price...worth far more, however!! Hallmark gets an A+ from this teacher for their productions. Will plan to purchase for family members. Very happy with this purchase."
1,kind of pointless to light up,"I purchased this for my Yukon which has a built in button that you push to use the ""trailer"" function, SO in order for this to work, that button must be pushed in and also a different connector must be put on the trailer plug. but if you have a two way plug this item would work great!"
4,AMAZING MUSIC... annoying voice,"I bought this record with high esteem. I put it in the cd player and went to the song i knew, ""Wacko Jacko..."" (my favorite song). Then i checked out the others... all were almost equally as good.Their musical talent amazes me. One of the most technical bands out there, along with (old) Dillinger Escape Plan. Really, the only complaint I have is with his singing voice... its so emo and pop-y... it ruins a lot of it for me. I like my share of emo, but he has the kind of voice that just annoys me (WHINY!!!). HARDCORE FANS DO NOT FRET however, their is plenty of screaming.This is a GREAT ALBUM that any guitarist or drummer alike can enjoy. Give it a listen."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"The singing style and erratic rhythms and melodies are more often than not shamelessly imitating The Mars Volta. I don't know how this singer expects to get away with the blatant imitation. When they aren't trying to be The Mars Volta, they're sounding like an underdeveloped funkier version of Botch or The Blood Brothers which isn't unique enough to be interesting or tuneful enough to be catchy. Technical ability is the only thing these guys have going for them. There isn't a moment of originality or quality songwriting to be found on this album."
2,"Yeah, It's a doppleganger","""Doppelg?nger"", in German literally means ""double walker"", i.e. a look-alike.This is a lookalike of the self titled album, but falls far short. I'm not quite sure what they were trying to accompish here, besides make tons of money by appealling to a more mainstream crowd, but I don't like it. It doesn't have the intensity and spontaniety of the self-titled release. If you like this album, do yourself a favor and buy the original."
1,For a child only,"I purchased this player to use in the gym to find it held only eleven songs. I am not as knowledgable about these products so perhaps I should have read the specs more closely. In all, it is OK to get for a youngster perhaps, but I can get more than 11 songs on a CD."
5,Makita Table Saw,Good product. Just what I expected. Very pleased with Amazon---will purchase items through them in the future.
1,It's a relabeled/repackaged UMAX Astra 3400!,"The Compaq S4 100 is a relabeled/repackaged UMAX Astra 3400. Althoughthat's not a bad thing, the UMAX version costs less (after rebates onboth versions) and comes with a 1-year warranty compared to Compaq's90-days. Unless this scanner is being ""thrown in"" with aCompaq PC purchase, or unless you're intent on getting the Compaq namefor some reason or another, check out UMAX's version."
2,Listen to the other reviews!,"I purchased this product based on JVC's reputation and the fact that I've used one of their VHS-C's for years. However, I was extremely disappointed with this unit. My JVC GR AX-910 VHS-C tapes, converted to digital via my ATI 8500DV video card to the hard drive, has a better picture quality than this digital camera. No joke."
3,"Flimsy, but okay i guess.","Well, when I received the bag, I thought it would be bigger. The interesting thing about the bag is that although it may seem small; it actually can accommodate a lot of books and stationery. The only thing that worries me is that the bag may break. It seems flimsy. School hasn't started, so I haven't gotten a chance to try it out on campus yet. Since I go to a private school, my books are of humongous proportions and tend to wear out any bag. I hop the JanSport bag won't break; it'll be a big hassle if I have to buy a new one."
3,"interesting, but a bit of a letdown.","black dice's drummer left. one would think their compositions would still sparkle celestial, but the lack of powerful drumming dramaticlly takes away from their sound. sonically, these two compositions are fascinating - and the sheer exuberance the black dice approach the compositions with remains as infectious here as on the beaches and canyons lp and the cone toaster 12"". While both pieces are interesting, it often times fails at engaging the listener.However this judgement may be inaccurate as the music was meant to be heard as part of an installation and may be very effective in its prepared enviorment."
4,Tuck Triumphant was a good book.,"Kirah Book ReviewTuck Triumphant was a good book. I would recommend this to a friend because a dog is a man's best friend. The main characters are the Helen, Tuck, Mr. and Mrs. Ogden, Stan , Luke, Chok-Do, and Lady Daisy. Tuck is a blind dog, but Lady Daisy is Tuck's seeing eye dog. It was interesting when the Odgens didn't know that they adopted a little deaf boy, Chok-Do Choi. They thought that they adopted a regular kid. He is a little Korean boy that is 6 yrs. old. Well, the wasn't very fast, I thought. Don't take my word for it, read to see if they keep Chok-Do."
2,I thought the book was an O.K. book.,"I thought that the book Tuck Triumphant was an O.K. book. It wasn't that bad. It wasn't a book I would like to read again. It was a good book at some parts. Some parts it wasn't so good. Some parts I think are strange like when Helen's family already has lots of kids, a blind dog and another dog. They adopted another kid from another country. Another thing is they have to be careful because they have a blind dog and a deaf child."
2,I did not like the book Tuck Triumphant,"I did not like the book Tuck Triumphant. It was not a good book in my opinion. I Would not recommend it to a friend because it was not very funny to me. But the best part was when Lady Daisy died and if they were going to get another dog for Tuck. Some people were Helen , Tuck and Chok -Do. If you want to read the book for your own opinion you can go to the book store. If you want to know if the Ogden's keep Chok-Do read the book. Tricia"
5,Bright,"Bright, thats all I can say. This is my first led light and Iam very impressed. I wanted a led for a while but they where out of my budget until this one."
1,DOESN'T DESERVE 1 STAR,This printer is a piece of junk. I have another lexmark/compaq and a HP. Both of my lexmark/compaq printers don't feed the paper in straight and the printer takes in more than one sheet of paper an prints a page of stuff on five sheets of paper. I would recomend hp's or epson's BUT DON'T BUY A LEXMARK.
1,We must oppose false teachings like these!,"Jesse Duplantis (not to mention Kenneth Copeland) is a false teacher. How long will the Christian Church tolerate these blasphemies? I could recomend no books by Duplantis or practically any TBN ""preacher"". Please please buy Hank Hannegraaff's ""Counterfeit Revival"" instead!"
5,The Tain,I've been searching for a good translation of The Tain. This by far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this to those studying Irish myth and legend.
1,Better throw your money in the trash bin,"By far the worst hand blender I have ever used. I needed to replace my broken Hamilton Beach blender. Given how much I used it I decided to buy better quality than my Hamilton-Beach, so I bought the Cuisinart CSB-33 QuikPrep. What a disappointment! It doesn't puree anything, on the contrary everything gets stuck on the the perimeter of the blade guard. It does not detach, so cleaning is also painful. If all you want to blend is banana, buy this, otherwise do not bother."
5,My backyard and next door neighborhood.,"My back yard and neighborhood area.I live just up the hill from the site of Blockhouse Run, mentioned in the book as a skirmish site. Thrilling , captivating, and intriguing to think all this happened so close, not so long ago."
2,Too much chronicle.,I thoroughly enjoyed the Frontiersman but this was too much data - I enjoy Eckert's descriptives and narratives - should have known as it is described as a chronicle of events.
4,Good all around glasses.,"I always tend to lose my glasses, so I never buy expensive pairs. This is about as much as I ever pay for them, and I am quite satisfied. I use them primarily for biking (there are a ton of bugs here that always seem to want to kamikaze your eyes).These glasses are pretty much what you would expect. Nothing too special, not particularly light, but still decent in every way. They are comfortable to wear, which is sometimes an issue for me because apparently I have a big head. They never seem too tight like many other glasses do.If you need eye protection and don't want to spend a colossal amount of money, these glasses do just fine."
3,KING KONG OF LUNCH BUCKETS !,"I PURCHASED THIS LUNCH BUCKET FOR MY SON TO TAKE TO WORK. HE IS TALL AND THIN, YET EATS ALL DAY- LUCKY ,HUH? THIS BUCKET HOLDS AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF FOOD. HUGE BOTTOM COMPARTMENT AND ANOTHER DECENT SIZE COMPARTMENT IN THE ""HOOD"" . I COULD PUT SEVERAL CANS OF SODA OR BOTTLES OF WATER, 2 SANDWICHES, FRUIT, AND SEVERAL SNACKS- COOKIES, KRISPIES TREATS, BROWNIES, AND BAG OF CHIPS (PLUS PLASTIC UTENCILS AND NAPKINS). I USED THE ""HOOD"" COMPARTMENT TO PUT IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH A HOT FOOD (LIKE MEATBALLS OR SAUSAGE) OR A HOT SANDWICH. THE REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT FIVE (5) STARSIS THAT THE ZIPPER BROKE. THE LUNCH BUCKET CAME WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY. WHEN I TRIED TO GET A REPLACEMENT, WHICH YOU HAVE TO EMAIL THE PROBLEM WITH PHOTOS, THE COMPANY (IN CANADA) SAID THEY NO LONGER HAD THESE AVAILABLE?. AND THEY HAD NOTHING COMPARABLE IN SIZE .CALIFORNIA INNOVATIONS MADE A GREAT LUNCH BUCKET AND THEN DISCONTINUED. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTING."
4,Super Fun,My nephew loves getting tattoos whenever we go to a fair or place that does temporary tattoos and he is always buying temporary tattoo stickers. I saw this and thought of him instantly. He is 6 and he is using it easily once we showed him how. Now the whole family has tattoos by him. The red ink is a little harder to get off then the others. I am hoping we can find refills or other pens that will fit when these pens dry up.
3,C'est pas mal parce que les sources sont comme ci-comme ca.,Cette disque c'est bon a ecouter pour le raison semplement M. Hallyday est en le forme bien avec les chansons amours dans les soixantes Tout le musique est vieaux mais les chansons amours est tres amusament pour les temps.
5,leopard shoes,"i own quite a few pairs of Skechers...i enjoy the product greatly, i also enjoy the quality of the product.i enjoy lepoard print items and decided to purchase these shoes, and i love them."
4,Great book,I really liked the setup of this book. It's really easily read and asks all the questions your thinking as you're reading.
1,Kindle version is a mess,"I honestly can't give a fair review to the content of this book because I only made it through the first chapter or so. The problem is that the Kindle version of this title is RIDDLED with typos. Some are actually kind of funny (like substituting ""pogrom"" for ""program""), but in the end, they make the book very difficult to read. The book also contains a lot of computer screenshots, and in the Kindle version, they're impossible to read as they are. You can click on them to zoom in, but (a) this slows you down quite a bit, and (b) some of them are still very difficult to read, even in the zoomed version. If you know anything about programming, you know that not being able to properly read punctuation in code is a disaster. Periods, commas, semicolons, and different brackets are all important, and if you can't read them, you're in for a lot of frustration.If you're interested in this title, find a print copy instead."
5,Not only learn Java--truly enjoy it,"As someone with practically no programming background, I found John Smiley's book, LEARN TO PROGRAM WITH JAVA, extremely helpful.I enjoyed the many real life illustrations used to explain sometimes complex Java jargon.I enjoyed the real college class format with the comments & questions from ""students"" - some who were seasoned in programming, and others who were, like me, babes.I really enjoyed the real world project presented from Chapter One; this gave the whole book a practical application & focus from day one.John Smiley's book has done more than help me learn Java, his book has helped me enjoy it!"
5,Very useful book,The book is really useful for all students and researchers. It is well organized and written in easy language that would help in understanding. It also contain practical examples that illustrates the main key in reading and writing in easy scientific way.
2,"Not a total lemon, but . . .",". . . this book is of limited use here in Korea. It seems to be a typical example of the way in which Americans believe their methods are the best - pure North American navel-gazing, if you ask me.I have also worked in Taiwan and it is the same there - shops full of American books being sold as ESL titles when in fact they are intended for native American English speakers who already speak the language.Get real, people. Nothing I have tried to use from this book has worked since I bought it."
3,Not for use with sensitive electronic devices,"One might expect, as I did, this device to operate as a switch, meaning that on means on and off means off, right? Not the case here. This device in the off position still manages to let through minimal amounts of voltage which with some electronic devices is just enough to flash the LED's and make them beep, or sound off as if they were about to turn on."
5,What A Long Slide from Camelot,"Succinct, sensible, scholarly not sneering...if only George II had chosen the likes of Mr. Schlesigner for his advisors instead of the neocon nincompoops who've set in motion the waning of our military & economic power, influence, and prestige. The accident of history that gave us a president with no sense of history along with a messianic mission has done more damage to our country than the communists of past or the terrorists of present.This book cries out to be read by every thoughtful, reflective, informed American. So much for any sales in Crawford (even though it's only 7 chapters and 150 pages). Perhaps if W. could read a chapter a week he'd finish while still on vacation!"
4,Great CD that is hard to find in the US,"This band has haad several lineups, but this is a very enjoyable CD that is hard to find in the US. My Russian friend prefers this to the most recent CD with Basia while I prefer Matt's Mood. Not a bad pick if you can find it."
5,Giant-Killers,"An amazingly distilled discussion exploring the fascistic roots of psycholanalysis, Marxism, and capitalism. Certainly not for the timid of heart, Deleuze-Guatarri weave a tapestry than unravels soon after reading. A must for anyone interested in post-structural discussions of power."
2,no easier,"One would think postgraduate degrees would make these types of works readable, but unless there is plenty of time to spend on it, I think it advisable to purchase also some sort of Anti-Oedipus companion. Who knows, perhaps one has also to be smoking something. Despite the previous, one can get sufficient glimpses of some creative thinking and pondering about modern life in general and about western capitalist societies in particular, enough to make one pay close attention or go for a post-second reading. Foucault's preface misleads one into thinking the book is a piece of cake: great marketing strategy."
3,A bit too much,"Entertaining, unpredictable and perhaps partially true. It seemed an almost inane attempt to attain omniscience. The concepts were interesting, but I don't think that they will work in reality, unless of course, you want to play God. Good old fashioned down to earth morals...I think that's the cure for facism. As far as schizophrenia...well I think even socialist countries have schizophrenics, so I don't really see the connection. As for me, I will keep my organs for myself and significant other."
5,Patti At Her Best,"This is an excellent CD. Patti Austin is performing her greatest hits and some new songs (at the time) that can only be sung in the unique, stylish manner of Patti Austin. Excellent CD!"
4,Planctus David Super Saul Et Ionatha,"The Abelard piece ""Planctus David Super Saul Et Ionatha"" is a minor masterpiece irrespective of who the author would have been. This is an amazing piece of early music."
1,Dissapointing Re-imagining.,"Well, it had to happen did,nt it ? In this world of remakes and rehashes someone had to ressurect this horror classic, the only trouble is it just does,nt work! The interesting part of this double disc presentation is the excellent documentary EPK which is on disc two. This little gem is a must for those interested in going behind the scenes of these movies, very nicely done! The second documentary, The American Nightmare, has been a special feature on another horror DVD, which it makes it a dissapointing choice for a second special feature. Tobe Hooper tries to work his magic but the story just can,t decide whether its trying to be like Texas Chainsaw or Friday 13th. Jason Voorhees or Leatherface? Take your pick? The scriptwriters tell us that this is a re-imagining,not, a remake, but to be honest they might have made this a lot more scary if they,d stuck to the original premise! Angela Bettis is superb, its just a pity the fear factor scores a total of Nil!!!!"
2,Mildy entertaining....,Although the acting is terrible and the production values are cheaper than dirt... the movie had some odd scares in the last 15 minutes.The killer looked creepy yet it goes no where until about an hour into it. I was about to turn it off then it got a bit better. It was fairly gruesome and had very few entertaining parts in it.Overall I would say skip it unless you have nothing better to watch.
3,"Used to work, but now it doesn't??","When I first discovered this stuff, I was very pleased because it was a safer alternative to deodorants that have aluminum and other chemicals. After a while, it did nothing for odor. I'd take a shower, pour the product into my hand and apply. Still didn't work. I noticed that other people who have used crystal deodorants have experienced the same problems. I guess for now, I'll go back to using Toms."
2,Ho Hum,"I wasn't wowed by this purchase.In fact, I was a little disappointed.There weren't really specific ways to bring the big ideas into my hectic life with 4 kids.Cute title but it didn't seem to live up to ""jesus"" and ""Buddha"" that's for sure.I'll stick with getting my parenting information from a few other tried and true books that never leave my bedside, including Anne Lammott's Operating Instructions (yup it's funny and spiritual) and Mimi Doe's 10 Principles for Spiritual Parenting (I can always find a tip that will work with my situation).So, good try but...doesn't stack up."
5,made us laugh,"Our oldest son loves the Charlie Brown movies, so anytime I find a new one, I get it for him. This one is great! It made us laugh. It's so cute!"
1,Disgusting !,"The recipes in this book were really horrible. It's very old-fashioned, has no nice pictures in it (which I think is always important)and I honestly couldn't find a single dish I would like to cook."
1,Five Star Childish Rubbish Rating,"Reading a book from a priest is like ""letting the fox watch the hen house."" As if a former priest could really open your mind to original thought? The nightmare will not go away until you reopen your mind.A great truth book has been written by a former Catholic priest, Fr. Stephen Frederick. Before you commit your entire life to becoming fooled...again...read him carefully..."
1,Product is sub-standard,Upon receiving both music CD's I deemed their music quality inferior and requested substitutions which I received but they also were bad. I had a piano teacher listen to them and in her opinion they were recorded from a piano roll playing explaining the sudden rises and falls of tempo. Perhaps this is the only way they could be recorded but that should be brought to the attention of the buyer.
5,Volume 2!,"I'm really excited to see this is coming out, considering I purchased Volume One back in Decemeber. I can't wait to relive the great moments and music numbers Glee had to offer."
4,Glee,I received the 1st volume of this season a while ago and could not find the 2nd anywhere and was thrilled to find it here. Reasonable price and great quality.
3,Feel taken advantage of,"I have read the posts that blame Fox, the producer of the DVD, and not Amazon for the situation with the Glee season one vol. 2 DVD. But I am still angry at Amazon. I order from Amazon at least every other month- they have gotten a lot of my money over the years. I still feel ripped off that if I order the vol. 2 DVD then I will have paid $42.50 for season one. I always learn from my mistakes. Never again will I order a volume one of a TV season- from now on I will always wait until the full season has been released. As I said, I feel like I have been taken advantage of. I live overseas and I do not have access to regular network TV. I was so eager to order the vol. 1 because I was so excited to start watching ""Glee."" Shame on you Fox and Amazon!"
4,Good Item!!!,"I recently purchased this item as a gift for my boyfriend, and for what I hear from him he loves it. He says that he still has to get use to how it all functions but the soft touch pads are great. Overall it is a great investment to have if you love making music."
5,YOU CAN EAT THIS AS LEFTOVERS,"I am usually disappointed by gf lasagne, either the noodles fall apart in the water or you cannot eat it the next day. Surprise!!! - not only do these noodles not fall apart, you don't have to precook if you don't want to - you can have leftovers - we did for two days!!!!"
1,Only lasted 6 months,"I'm really disappointed in this card. After 6 months of use, the card's fan seized and stopped spinning causing the capacitors on the card to blow out. Luckily there's a 2 year warranty, however it's a hassle and inconvenience to send the card back and wait on the RMA. This is the second card of this same type that we had a problem with, I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
3,Cortazar is brilliant,"(Bought from literalbooks2) The way Cortazar writes is brilliant especially in Rayuela (Hopscotch in English). There are two ways to read this book, either cover to cover or in the order he intended for you to read it which is like a hopscotch game around the book. It's hard to describe the story without cheapening it, it's honestly just a book you should experience for yourself and take from it what you'd like. I just really enjoyed his writing style."
4,Anotated edition of Rayuela (Julio Cortazar's novel),"I sent it as a gift to my son in France, because I already have it at home in Buenos Aires and I feel it is the ideal companion to the original version because it illuminates some quotations and references that Cortazar includes without explaining.This book allows for a better and richer experience when re-reading Rayuela, by all means a very worth while experience."
1,"Terrible, non-absorbent, useless","I received two of these from our baby registry. This burp cloth is totally useless. While it's attractive enough, be warned of the following before buying:1. It's too small2. It's completely 100% NON-absorbent. Milk drips onto is and just sits on the surface, ready to soak into baby's clothes (or your clothes).3. The two sides of the cloth are only attached at the edges, so the cloth feels particularly cheap and insubstantial.For me, the biggest strike against this was the fact that it just doesn't soak up any milk. USELESS."
4,The next Leo Tolstoy!!!!!!,"The book hasn't come out yet, but I have read his stories in magazines and workshops. Knew him from grad school in Montana. (This is Richard Nunez, David, if you happen to read this). I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by his progress since '94 and '95. He's showing great promise. I highly recommend the book if the other stories are as good, or better than, ""Remote Feed,"" ""Graffiti,"" and one I believe is titled ""Still Life with Enormous Foot,"" or something like it. The stories are mysterious, weighty, bizarre, poignant, and sometimes eerie. You'll even chuckle out loud a few times. Pick it up! This review may sound subjective, but I was honest about my rating. Good work, David."
2,"Question to ""K. R. Vrieze""","I'm planning to go to Greece for 2 weeks in early June. What were the other 4 maps that you took and how would you rate them? I'm taking a Lonely Planet Guide and Berlitz Phrase Book with me. Plus will try to pick up a few phrases with the Pimsleur language CD.Thanks in advance,Roland Thomas"
1,"Well detailed, but boring.","This book was very informative, but I found it boring and full of ""fluff"". It was not straight and to the point. As a student, it is a horrible book because the information is too vast."
4,Just the hard words,"I chanced upon the hardbound 1971 edition of this at a library sale. Wow! This is exactly what I was looking for when I bought the ""Oxford Essential Dictionary of Difficult Words."" I felt that Oxford had the right idea but their execution was disappointing (inclusion of too many Easy Words and omission of some oft-encountered Difficult ones.) This book from the Times seems to have been undertaken with exactly the right editorial philosophy.Except - I must agree with at least one reviewer who complained that too many of the words are specialized technical, medical, legal and scientific terms which the average reader is unlikely to encounter. This is a weakness, and because of it (as well as a certain vagueness & incompleteness of many definitions) I must take away a star.Still, this book has ""succedaneum"" and the Oxford book does not. Winner: the Times."
1,Window Feeder,"I purchased this feeder to replace one that had broken. Supposed to be a window mount. However, once the top and bottom are screwed together, it is impossible to mount on a window because the perch is against the glass. The only way to mount is to not completely screw on the bottom, which didn't work either because it fell off. I was very disappointed, and I think my Hummingbirds were to, because there has always been a feeder on this window. It is now hanging in a tree, not where I wanted it."
5,I love the look of these,"These look great! I know it says these are batter heads but being single ply they are well suited to being used as resonant heads, which is what I am using it for. The look of these are great, with a high shine and a cool blacked out appearance.B"
4,GreatValue,"Excellent value, decent product. I've dropped the watch a couple of times and it still works fine. It's plastic, but so are the higher priced stopwatches. Why spend more?"
1,Poor quality refrigerator and customer service,I had the exact same problem with the water line on my LRSC26923TT LG refrigerator. LG would not cover the repair or the damage to my kitchen. They said they had no knowledge of these water lines being an issue. They are made out of cheap plastic and should be metal lines. This stuff is junk. Their customer service department is the worst I have every dealt with.
2,service sucked,"The product was beautiful however I wouldn't purchase from this vendor EVER again. After spending almost $200 on shawls, the woman at the shop had the nerve to verablly harrass me and my friend where I shipped the box for a $5 UPS fee since the address had to be corrected. It probably cost the woman more in long-distance charges to verbally assualt us then the $5 itself. NEVER AGAIN!"
5,No complains,"This is my first tablet, so I probably do not know what to look for (to ""really"" review it), but I am very pleased with it and have no complains. Just one little problem: the working area is so big, that when you use it to navigate your desktop you have to move not just hand but a whole arm around from one corner to another."
5,The Bigger the Better,"I started with a 6x8 tablet and it worked great for the 2 years that I had it. But after up-sizing my monitor to anApple Cinema 23"" HD Flat-Panel Display, I noticed a difference in precision. Upgrading to the 9x12 tablet was a smart move. Have a more 1-to-1 tablet-to-screen ratio was a smart move."
3,great introduction on little known subject,this book is an excellent introduction for this little known colonial theater of operations with beautifull full color illustraions i recomend this book for anyone interested in colonial campaigns and indian history
4,"Easy to wrap, comfortable","This tape is very comfortable to ride with. It adds plenty of padding for tired hands/wrists. The color was great, very vibrant and bright. I had never tried wrapping my handlebars before and this tape was very easy to figure out. I really bought this for the appearance and my bike looks fantastic now. New handlebar tape is great for making an older bike look ""snazzy"" again."
4,Very Forgiving,"Ever go to re-tape a handlebar and you just totally mess it up? I have. I admit it. Then you need to buy more handlebar tape - and do it right the second time. This stuff is VERY FORGIVING. You can bend it - stretch it - pull on it...if you goof up, simply unwind a little & start again. Just remember to wrap the left side bar clockwise starting at the bottom & working up. The right side bar - just the opposite. Start at the bottom & wrap counter-clockwise.Very comfy also. Good stuff!"
5,Great tape,This is good tape for the money. Nice and comfortable and seems to last awhile. This is now the tape I now mainly use.
3,Good but not great,"This product is great on the hands, but doesn't easily finish by stuffing in the end of the handle bars."
1,Not what it says,"As another review mentioned, these are NOT the highly rated mitts I was expecting from Flameguard. In less than a year they were useless."
5,EN-LIGHTNING,"In the 1st Chapter of his book the author invites us to join him along for the journey in the lighting world of television and video with a promise that by the end of this journey i.e. of the book, we will be able to understand and create with the lights in our own digital frames.I finished the book, it realy was a journey and Mr. Jackman kept his promise.Thank you Mr.Jackman"
5,Tibet flag.,"Good quality, very attractive, and well priced. I do not know how it will last out side. I have it hanging inside to remind me of the teachings of Buddha and the plight of the Tibetans."
2,One complaint:,"The 2-star rating may be unfair, but I had to give a 1-star demerit because the CD did not have at least the radio edit of the original. BUT, the Morales Club Mix and Tiefschwarz Hollywood Extended Mix weren't bad.That's my biggest beef with remix CDs -- put a copy of the original on the d*** thing!"
3,False Starts,"I found this book to be very disturbing. It is depressing and rather dreary. If this is a reflection of the author psyche, she must be in a very sad and lonely place. I found the plot to be rather vague and disjointed. The title gave me the biggest clue as to the purpose of the book. I feel that this book would have benefited by having a preface. Taken on a chapter by chapter basis, I did find the book to be appealing. While rather grim, the author was able to hold me with her wonderful details and descriptions. I felt like I was actually there. This book is not really my cup of tea, but I must admit that Ms. Smith was definitely able to draw me in emotionally. I felt an empathy for the main character and I kept rooting for her to improve her lot in life. This book is worth reading if only for the wonderful alliteration."
1,i agree with the first review,"i bought this game long time ago from a normal store. do not buy it, it may be the worst fishing game ever made of all time. As said in the first review it was a horrible time just trying to get the game to load then it runs only half the time with crashed and cheap graphics just dont waste your money on this."
5,Alot of fun,"This book was very entertaining and fun to read. The adventure of librarian Wick Lamplighter was exciting, bold, and at times amusing. The story follows Wick, a dweller (halfling) from the vault of all known knowledge, after he has been kidnapped aboard the pirate ship ""One-Eyed Peggie"". Mr. Odum's writing style is clean and concise, his descriptions are colorful and imaginative. For lovers of fantasy this is a great read. I highly recommend it."
3,Length of movie very disappointing,"Have been eagerly anticipating watching this movie. Little did I know that the trailer was almost as long as the movie.$15 for a 30 minute movie just strikes me as being ridiculous. $5-$7 would have been more appropriate. Other than that,the short movie was good. I enjoyed it."
4,Good purchase,"Although this was a movie/ DVD that my kids wanted and asked for, I was surprised to find out after getting it home that the entire DVD is less than 30 minutes long. I was a little disappointed. The kids didn't care though, which made me happy."
2,Had to return this one...,"I realized this liquid multivitamin was causing me to get headaches, increased my blood pressure, and generally caused a feeling of anxiety. Too bad because it had the mix of vitamins and supplements I had been looking for. However there were several uncommon herbs thrown in that I believe caused the problems for me. I did not have this problem with Alive! liquid but that didn't contain iron so I switched to this.Next of my list: Source of Life."
5,The best for exactly what it says...everyday magic!,"I've found this book to have SOOOOO many spells and formulas that are actually usable in day to day life. It seems that no matter what the occasion, this book has a spell for it....and the setups/ingredients are easily found and employed. It is the best book for spells I've ever found, and I have about 40 books on the subject. I keep the book handy because I use it somewhere at least 3-4 times a week!"
5,Large print is easy to read!,"I bought this bible because I could no longer read the small print in my other bibles. If you want to be able to read the bible without wearing glasses, then this is the one for you."
4,Great book and so fast delivery,"I am from China and my family has the Christan tradition early from my late grandmother.It is my first time to try Amazon.com and also the first time to purchase overseas. From the order details, the delivery estimate is more than 30 days, however, I get it after only 10 days. So fast delivery and with a nice packing. Thanks to Amazon!I respect & like Christianity, however,I am still an atheist as I have been educated under atheism since I was a child, so stubborn am I? Anyway, I will read The Holy Bible and I think this great book will be with me for my whole life."
5,"Holy Bible, Giant Print Presentation Edition: King James Version",I love this Bible. It's font is just the right size -- no need for a magnifying glass to read it. Thank you to the brilliant person who decided to enlarge the print!
5,Great for people with very poor vision,"The Bible was given to a friend as a Christmas Gift.Our friend has poor vision because of diabetes and needed a bible she could read without alot of magnafication. Now when she sees and hears about ""Chapters and Verses"" in The Bible,She can look them up in her own personal Bible."
1,Poorly written...don't bother!,"This book was probably the worst piece of literature I've ever read. Whoever wrote it (there's no author noted -- who doesn't put the name of the author on the cover?) clearly has no sense of storytelling, suspense, or editing. There's this giant section about who begat who and how long they lived, and after that awful chapter I had pretty much given up on the Bible. Some of the Psalms were lovely, and the New Testament picked up a bit, but overall the whole thing was completely unbelievable, illogical, and badly written. My grandmother mentioned that she likes to read the Bible every night before bed, and I thought that was a brilliant idea...the book is ABSOLUTELY effective at putting you to sleep."
3,"FINISHED WITH THE ""SONGS""","Well, I just wrote a very long, detailed review and guess what, the site crashed. So, to be brief. ""Secret Song"" was better than the dreadful ""Fire Song"" starring Graelam the Cad. ""Earth Song"" and ""Warrior's Song"" were very enjoyable (and the reason I purchased Fire and Secret). I noticed that on the back cover, the author states that she wrote these books some time ago and that she didn't do any rewriting, just enjoyed the new cover design. I think that Ms. Coulter might take some time to review these reissues."
3,A White-Wash of a Book,"Bozulich I am sure is an exelent player but he lacks the confidence and posibly the knowlage to lay down hard and fast go principles. He explains Josekis but in a way that leaves you wanting a deeper more heartfelt examination of the positions. A good book to start with, but not one that will take you very far by its self."
5,An excellent guide for confronting racism,"_Fulfilling the Dream_ is a book that would fill the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with hope. Written by a white laywoman, it is an honestassessment of both personal struggle on the issueand a critical but loving examination of the failures of religious institutions in addressing this most essential of contemporary problems. As a woman of faith, Branding helps us withthoughtful questions that deepen reflection and draw on the spiritual powers that enable all of us to do the hard work of confronting the demons in ourselves and our society. Having worked with students at a major university, I see this as a text that would be extremely useful for college chaplains and student study groups. I could not recommend it more highly."
4,Staying Young,"All I can say, is Mr. Alers has out did her self with this one. I am 7 years older than my spouse ( this was close to home ). This is a must read. Found this book used and read it in 2 days."
4,Dylan French Style,"Because this album was recorded in 1965, Hugues Aufray captures the mood of the songs of the times pretty well, in fact and this is my opinion, and there is no mention of the harmonica player in the credits, It could be Bob himself pitchin' in. The French language is remarkable as well as romantic and I like this CD for that reason alone. Where else can I learn to sing French songs but through an album like this. I like it."
