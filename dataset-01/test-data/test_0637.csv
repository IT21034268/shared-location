1,Don't waste your money,"My husband and children make milkshakes daily so I decided this would be a neat gadget to buy. This didn't even have enough power to make a milkshake...it just put a hole in the middle of the ice cream. It's also made totally of plastic. I returned it back the next day. If you need to whip up breakfast drinks and chocolate milk, I bought a small hand held whisk from Pampered Chef for $3 and it works great."
4,Gets the job done with panache!,"If you're looking for a powerful shakemaker or ice crusher or blender, this isn't your machine. Also, if you're looking for such a device that's made from metal, well, you'll get that when cars return to using chrome (instead of plastic) for their bumpers. Let's get real here people! No, it can't be used for mixing concrete. This is a nostalgic yet fully functional kitchen appliance that I have now used for years to make my family malted milkshakes (several times a week!)It requires a bit of finesse - art - to make it purr for you, but that's half the fun. Given the price, it's a good value. Given the enjoyment it can provide your family, it's invaluable!"
1,What is the point?,"Other than it's use as a cute looking retro gadget, I do not understand the point of this device. It is flimsy, low powered and has a single use.You would be much better served by buying immersion blender which would perform the same task (and many others) more effectively."
1,annapolis,this is absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the title should be boxing at someplace that should pass for the naval academy
1,A boxing movie nobody will care about,"Just another boring boxing movie. The Navy and Annapolis are just vague background. This is one of those movies you don't care about the characters and the story is weak. Just a movie that after you watch it, you wish you could get back those minutes of your life you wasted watching it."
1,"Annapolis, more like Crapapolis","What could be better than a movie about a poor son of a factory worker proving once in for all that he is tough enough for a prestitgious military acadamy. Well, pretty much anything else. Not only did this movie enforce stereotypical stupid values, it conveyed them almost as uncreatively as a political advertisement. Other wonderfull features of this movie included: bad acting, horribly written robotic dialogue, as well as montages with corny music."
2,Soap Opera For Men,"Pretty predictable and dull. I found it hard to feel for Huard because he had a bad attitude. If you can't take orders, you do not belong in the armed forces. I liked his roommate ""Arkansas"" Nance better because he had heart. Still, none of the characters or the plot grabbed my attention."
3,The Flyboys,"the DVD was received all scratched up, Tried to clean it up but didn't help. Was able to see the movie OK."
2,Good Film Uneven Blu-Ray Disc,"i have always liked the film and have played my regular dvd many times. in fact the film is a must for James Franco fans for a number of reasons. whichbrings me to my rating. the 2 stars are for the blu-ray disc not the film.at many points in the film the picture and sound simply doesn't have thezest and bite you expect a blu-ray disc to have. i recently found out thereare two ways of burning a blu-ray disc, one an expensive way the other acheaper less expensive way . i'm guessing they chose the cheaper way for this blu-ray disc."
5,Simply great,"1. Fast moving salsa with greath rythm, accents and instrumentation for dancing2. Refreshing, different from more other salsa you will find being produced today3. Salsa ""dura"" without abusing on the brass instruments and still having a strong percussion base4. Great even for simple listening at home"
5,The Ghost of Fossil Glen,"Do you like scary mysteries? If you do, then you should read the book The Ghost of Fossil Glen.A girl named Allie has been feeling like she has been watching her and following her every step. She goes through lots of scary adventures till finally she figures out she has been being haunted by a ghost. Along the way she finds clues, and loses one of her best friends. Will Allie's life ever be normal again? Or will she be going through a nightmare that never ends? Read to find out how it all turns out!I really enjoyed the book The Ghost of Fossil Glen because there is non-stop adventure that's keeps you guessing and inferring who is haunting Allie. Another reason why I love this book is because it has lots of detail and keeps the reader thinking. I know people will love this book just as much as I did!I really hope you read this book or at least give it a try. Read to find out what happens to Allie on her scary journey!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Russia and others have blown the crap out of the USA, nuclear style.Now an isolated, broken down country, the United Nations enforces this situation, and Robinson looks at what it is like to live inside this boundary.The main character is a young man finding his way.There are some funny parts, such as the yarns their elders spin them at times about 'the old days', and the author has fun with that part."
4,"Very creative,colorful,and great mom/tot interaction","I found this book to offer stimulating interaction between mom/tot. I do not have a suggestion for solving this problem, but the pages cannot be turned without knocking off the cheerios. Of course, the tot can just eat them, which is the best solution of all. The book is super for eye-hand coordination, and small motor control. The cardboard construction is pretty indestructible. The cover is adorable and easily recognized by a toddler as a box of Cheerios, and the pictures are age appropriate and very colorful. This book is very creative. I wish I had thought of it myself."
2,Not the old Scooby Doo,"Call me old fashioned, but I prefer the original Scooby Doos. These new ones just get a little scary for little ones and are a little too dark. I don't like that the ""monster"" is not always a person in a costume like in the originals. I know it is only a cartoon, but I don't think some of this content is good for very young children. My 8 year old loves this, my 6 and 3 year olds are frightened by it and won't be in the same room when it is on."
4,Much easier to use than Peterson's,"This book has more information and is much easier to use than Peterson's. I found Peterson's useless, and I am purchasing this (I tried them both first at the library)."
5,Volume 5 = Fifth great book,"Once again, Tuxedo Gin does not disappoint.Chapters 1, 2, and 3 conclude the ""Fake Ginji"" subplot.Chapter 4 involves a Christmas Eve spent with a bunch of young kids who are little too excited about being alone with a penguin (and who could blame them ;) )Chapter 5 involves Minako getting accidently drunk on New Year's Eve.Chapter 6 involves Gin trying to get away from Minako's father so that he can keep some guys from ogling her.Chapter 7 involves penguins and ski slopes; 'nuff said. (The best of the book, adn that's saying a lot.)Chapter 8 introduced Nana to the storyline (i'm keeping what nana is a secret so not to spoil the book).Chapter 9 involves Gin trying to avoid giving Minako a love letter from a fat, mean cop.Absolutely fantastic stuff."
2,"Awww, not my style...even with Ray Alder on it.","Well, I really didn't understood this recording, sounds to me like Ray Alder's version of Korn or some thing similar. Even Bernie Versailles guitar is nowhere near the level of excellence shown in the Redemption's albums. I guess some people will like it, but i didn't."
4,Great!,"After reading Metal Blade's bally-hoos of this CD for quite some time, this was great to pick up. I am very impressed by this thoughtful effort. I don't know much about Ray Alder, but he's got lots of talent. Engine in my view is sort of like the Deftones minus the ""down"" atmosphere the 'tones have, and the rap. A great metal-mood CD to play in the car when you're going home with the girlfriend! ;-)"
3,Difficult to Assemble and Customize,"Like most organizers, this one includes a package of connected divider tabs that can be used to customize the size of each individual compartment. They come in bundles that seem to be designed to snap apart, but at least half of the dividers had to be cut with a pair of scissors or a box knife. I used a box knife with a brand new blade to separate the tabs, but it required a large amount of pressure to cut them successfully. Worse, many of the dividers had to be trimmed to fit properly into the slotted compartments. Several of the slots wouldn't accept a fully seated divider, despite multiple trimming attempts with multiple dividers. Once they fit, they fit great and seem to be very secure, but it's a chore to put the thing together.I bought two of these organizers and had to return one because it arrived with a crack in the lid. I opted for a refund because it's not worth the trouble of assembly to have a second organizer. I'll look for something else."
1,bad,I Purchased this product on 05/15/2008 the screen was messed up it played for a little while and went out. I had it replaced and the same thing happend with the new one i was sent. these are cheap and don't work do not purchase it. With the second one i asked for a refund from amazon and still didnt get it this was about 3 weeks ago.
1,Stopped working almost immediately,We had this machine less than a week before it stopped working. Spend the additional $40-$50 and get a functioning player.
4,It was fun.,"For sure a good toilet book, which is what fact books usually are... :) There were fun facts and it was well written."
3,It works but it is flimsy,The setup is quick and it definitely puts out the heat. Unfortunately after first use with the Mongolian BBQ cast iron pan the burn frame warped a bit at one of the corners.I would look for a heavier duty unit if made.
5,Platee,Had seen the opera in Santa Fe August 2007 and the entire audience was in continuous laughter! A review in the Albuquerque newspaper stated:' a must see opera and one for all children'. Purchased the DVD for me and also for a friend and will soon view it with my great grandchildren (4 & 6). It is hilarious!
4,Great Watch,"Love this watch, but had to go online to figure out how to shorten the band. They should provide instructions with the watch. So far it has kept time. The hands are bright in the dark. The size of the watch is just what I was looking for, not to big, and not to small. The band quality is really good also."
5,Great quality,"ExOfficio seems to always do great quality. These boxers are comfortable, light, and durable. Perfect for my travels I bring two pair and switch out."
5,Perfect for travel,"I got these for a 14 month trip around the world and they are AWESOME! So comfortable. They're the best underwear I've ever worn. They're quick dry, so you really only need to pack 2 pairs for a 14 month trip! Just wash one every night. I won't be wearing any other type of boxers from now on. Do yourself a favor, and get these"
5,Fantastic,"I ordered a pair of these and the smaller sized brief, and I am very impressed. These are extremely comfortable, and do an excellent job of preventing heat and sweat build up in my nether region. I use the smaller sized briefs during my workouts, and the boxers for everyday wear and lounging around the house. Standard cotton boxers cause me to get sweaty and chafe, but not here.I'll be getting more of both the smaller briefs and the boxers, as I highly recommend these to lower body sweaters....I know, sounds gross, but hey, as long as we're trying to fix the situation..."
2,Not all that...,"I don't know what everyone is going on about with these - at least in terms of looks. The picture suggests these hug your hips and thighs but in actuality, they're loose - perhaps too loose - especially in the pocket. They are lightweight and the fabric seems like it would easily wick moisture away. But the cut is not flattering for athletic bodies.I'm a 36 waist at 219 and 6'3"". The large are way too large. Replaced them with Mediums and they still felt too large - with very little support. If they fit like the picture showed, I would defintely be a fan. As they do not, I'm going to pass on these."
3,Just OK,"Have to laugh at their packaging. Lots of promoting of their ""Ultimat"" travel undies.You can wear for days! Treated for buges and ordor! What?Anyway, I'll give them a try but generally a classic cotton guy."
1,Big mistake,This item is not worth the money. I own several pair of under armor and will stay with them being they are the same price. They don't fit the way I like them.
3,Caballe All the Way,"Caballe's glorious voice in Strauss's heavenly music is really the only reason to acquire this live 1973 performance--but it's a damn good reason. Everything else is competent or somewhat better; the almost silent audience (one cougher excepted)allows for a comfortable listening experience. If one is acquiring only one ""Arabella,"" it should be the Solti/della Casa/London/Vienna Philharmonic recording on London with terrific performances in EVERY role. However, in the recording under consideration, Caballe at her peak is a powerful inducement."
3,Not worth the money for bigger kids.,"I wish I could give this product good ratings. My kids were so excited to get them,and we took them camping. There is a really great wide stream near the campground that is a favorite exploring place and I thought these would be good for that. Well, the little light is a waste, it didn't illuminate enough to see anything, and when it got wet it quit working. The kids were careful to not murk up the water, and still you couldn't see. They wound up wearing their swim goggles and putting their faces in the water and that worked much better. As for the telescope part, you could get a decent kids pair of binoculars for about the price of this. Maybe my kids were too old (7 and 9) and we expected too much from this, it might be good for little kids to pretend with (telescope) and introduce to the underwater world with."
1,Disappointment,The optics on this toy leave much to be desired. It's a good argument for buying toys of this type in a store where you can try them out first.
4,The Dragon and The Rose,"A very compelling story in which the reader is drawn into a world of Magic, intrigue and romance. The charecters are colorfully developed and the storyline flows with just enough mystery to keep the reader wanting more .... Very Good indeed !!!!"
4,Does The Job,"Not much special to say about this except that it holds enough oil to satisfy a full oil change on the majority of cars out there. The only thing I do not like about the pan is that there is no easy to pour spout, so you do need to be aware when emptying the pan into a container. None-the-less, it is an inexpensive, yet valuable tool for DIY'ers out there looking to save money on oil changes."
4,works,this product works well when you use alot of elbow grease with it. It takes the gonk off when you scrub
2,Disappointed,Was wary making a purchase like this without prior experience with similar products but I thought I'd trust the other reviews. Just received my order today and I'm returning it today. That should tell the whole story but read on if you want specifics.The knife looks sturdy enough and the blade sharp enough but the holster is a joke and the straps a way too short to wrap around your leg unless you're 10 years old or a model.The holster is also made of hard plastic and holds the knife so loosely it rattles every time it moves. Secondly the release mechanism on the holster is so flimsy the knife can fall out at anytime.I think they would have been better served selling the knife separately and junking the holster.
2,Cheap,"This knife is cheap, arrives dull, and will easily spot even if you rinse after each dive. Sheath is great...still should have returned."
4,Great Tool,Gave as a gift to my son who is in the military. He dives constantly and uses it alot. it floats
4,Lonely sounds,"Terry Bozzio is of course the soul of this album, but he's not everything there is to hear, there's also great saxofone and groovy sounds: makes me feel myself a bit abanded. This is the album for a lonely man living in small village beside mountains and forest in a small cottage with hifi-stereos and electricity."
4,A Very Good Book With Lots of Useful Information,"I bought the book ""Elements of Gas Turbine Propulsion"" in August of 1999 and I still read it almost everyday. It is a very interesting book, but it has a serious flaw in that there are so many errors, it appears that the editor(s) were asleep or out to lunch. It was a great disservice to the author, as I think he was shortchanged by the publisher. Being a former member of the USAF, myself I feel that his work was more meticulous than this. Perhaps the publisher was in such a hurry to hit the presses at all costs, that this is the result. This seems to be the trend in recent years. I believe that one of the major networks did and expose regarding major publishing house oversights in this area.Jim"
5,6 year old loves it!,I bought this toy for my daughters 6th birthday and she loves it. It has been very sturdy and has not fallen apart; however my husband is very good at putting things togeather maybe thats why. My daughter has not tried to take the tray off and it has not fallen off either. This is a great buy I highly recommend it.
3,what a rip off !,"Yes I am 13 and yes I still play with dolls so I definitly know what are good products to buy!I really wanted a high chair and because I already own graco items,i figured i this would be a good one.i bought this with my own money and when i took it out of the of the box i felt like screaming!it was incredibly small and the tray was impossible to open and when i got it off i couldn't put it back on!it wasn't sturdy at all, and my baby doll didn't fit in it.i gave this to my 3 year old cousin because shse wanted it so i know that she likes it.daughters and mothers don't waste your money on this high chair!!!!!!!!"
5,What a Great Book,With most guitar books I have the problem that they start real easy and then start spinning out of control. Not so with this book. I never had the feeling that I was lost or that there was to big of a level increase from one exercise to the other. What a great book! Other authors should use this book as an example. This book will teach you the basics of Travis Picking step by step. It is suitable for beginners and advanced players that like to learn the basics of Travis Picking.-D
2,Not real Merle Travis style,"Mr Hanson should start out stating that the style of picking he is teaching is at best Merle Travis ""like"".Merle Travis picked with his thumb and index finger .The book should be titled Contemporary Hanson Picking.This book does nothing but instill some bad habits i.e. proper finger/string relationships that will be hard to break once learned this way."
4,"A bit over-simplified, but useful",I have found this particular system to be a workable compliment to live lessons in finger picking.
3,Little deceptive,"I ordered 3 ""sets"" of pans and was extremely suprised that I only received 3 pans. When I read the description that said ""individual"" pans I was under the impression individual was refering to the size of the pans... individual serving size. I too, assumed from the picture that this was a set of 4 pans.I'm taking most of the blame for not reading the ad better but I do feel it would be helpful if they changed the picture in the add to display just one pan... since that is what you are truly getting. I was excited to get these because I love baking and I thought they would be helpful but really disappointed when they arrived. I will most likely be sending them back because I can purchase them through another company for a lower price."
4,If you like John Hyatt you will love this cd,"Great music, wonderfully written lyrics, though no liner notes which is a con for this purchase. There should at least be a hyperlink on the inside cover saying where you can go for the lyrics."
4,Great for Code Lyoko fans.,"My 5 year old loves Code Lyoko and really wanted to get this game, so we ordered it and it arrived quickly and we got a free tee shirt too (don't think all the sellers are giving the free shirt, we didn't even know we were getting it).So, if you're a die hard fan of the show, I really do think you will like it. Some parts are a little difficult for my daughter, so in comes the parent sub to help her shoot bad guys in the digital sea, or climb things etc. Once you get used to which character has which weapon, you can judge who will defeat the bad guys easiest, and some characters have better powers - like Odd's climbing ability.Some parts of the game are quite difficult too, but all in all a good game that my daughter has enjoyed playing and hasn't gotten anywhere near finishing yet.This is not a game for someone who has never watched the show, as a non-fan would probably find the characters and voices annoying.We fans love that part!"
4,Code Lyoko,My son enjoyed this game because you get to be different characters in the game play. He said he enjoys watching the Code Lyoko show on TV and now he can enjoy playing and being the different characters.
5,Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity,I bought this for my son and he is totally addicted to it lol it's hard for him to put it down! He said it looks just like the cartoon!
1,definitely fishy reviews,"After reading the fishy reviews post, I checked it out myself and that review was valid - the positive reviews were all from people who did not review any other author's work. Furthermore, most of them were posted on the same day or the next day - definitely suspicious - probably posted by authors friends."
1,The Cure for all Diseases,"This is a great book, has everything you need to know about getting healthy, BUT this book came in really really dirty condition, coffee stains on the first 17 pages, horrible condition, I went to the Library to read the book there, should have done that in the first place"
1,Tim's been busy,"With all the positive reviews for this labarynth of lies I assume Hulda Clark's publicist, Tim Bolen has been sending in multiple reviews. It can't be real cancer patients sending in reviews, they all die of cancer.If Hulda Clark is correct, then why not cure people of cancer in the US? Why not allow the system to be clinically trialled? If it's financial reward she seeks, proving her system works will lead to a nobel prize which has a $1,000,000. In fact she would likely win multiple nobel prizes.This book can be reviewed with one simple word.QUACK!"
1,eye opening book,very informative book. this kind of information will not befound in pharma sponsored publications. you owe it to yourselfto pick this one up.
2,Cure for all Diseases,I found this book hard to understand. Perhaps I am just no there yet. It may be that something easier to comprehend would be easier for the lay person to get their head around.
3,It's ok,"Very lengthy book, she's a little out there, but has some great ""recipes"" for health. Not too sure I will make the zapper she is talking about..."
3,Metro Carrying Case for Compact Photo Printers (Q8504A),"I was a bit disappointed that it did not have more space for carrying auxilury plugs, hook-ups and print paper."
2,HP Photosmart Metro Carrying Case for Compact Photo Printers,I was disappointed with the color of this case. The color shows a soft-light green. The green on the one that I received was like a pea green. Does not look like the one on the computer.I do not like this case. I probably will purchase another one from the stores here where I can actually see the product. These are the risk you take when ordering online.
4,A fine book about Alexander's triumphs and life.,I bought this book without knowing much about Alexander's triumphs in the ancient world. I always knew about the legends of Alexander but not the facts. This book describes the facts (as well as modern history knows about the facts) of his triumphs and ultimate death of Alexander. I look forward to reading more about Alexander the Great from various authors but I believe this will be one of the best books about him thus far.
1,Bored to Death,"It's hard to believe the other reviews here are for the book I read. The hero is smug and pretentious; the ""vampirism"" here is reduced from moral drama to the equivalent of a really good fitness routine (payoffs -- increased attractiveness and longevity, downsides -- well, none, really); the characters have the depth (but not the appeal) of graham crackers; the stereotypical British-isms are painful; the plot is so bad it should be staked through the heart... in short, the book *I* read was unrelievedly awful.If you like Sarah Caudwell or Laurell Hamilton, or if you value vivid characterizations, strong plotting and sharp dialog, avoid this book."
1,Horrible,Just wish I had read other reviews before I bought this stuff- I was stuck and needed something quickly until my normal (Revolution) flea/tick medicine arrived in the mail- horrible allergic rxn causing me to take the dog to the vet and put him on steroids for days! Will never make that mistake again... he would be less miserable with fleas!
2,Not from Iceland...,"Just as a word of warning, this is NOT the same Mum as the wonderful new group from Iceland. I made the mistake of purchasing this album under such pretense, and was sorely disappointed."
4,MUM -The self titled,"I bought this album because I was burned a CD with one of their songs on it(or so I thought).Sadly this is NOT the band from Iceland. Disapointing but true. This album has every thing that a great instrumental album should have: flow, melodic harmonies between instruments, and poise. Poise is a special quality I deemed for an album that you can listen to witout being overwhelmed; henceforth, not missing quaities in the music. For example, Metalica does not have poise. if you were to give a music outsider a metalica album to listen to he would probably say it sounded like just a bunch of noise. Mum has a way of flowing from song to song without losing the melody or the beat in the process. This sounds bad at first, but trust me all the songs have their own characteristics and ""sounds"". I think this CD is a great introduction into the instrumental world. hope this was helpful. -Sherman."
5,necessity,"this was a shower gift. one of the best ones ever.i love love love this.it is:comfortablesleekcool (temperature for you and the baby)easy to useattractive in design and patterngreat dvd instructions WITH printed/photo instructions for easy referralwe looked at other carriers and this wins out in everything. it takes a little getting used to using it, but once you get the hang of it, no worries.it's sp comfortable and easy, my husband even uses it. this design is not overly girly so it does dual duty well.love it. i would absolutely recommend this to every expectant parent.note: make sure you get the size that will fit you. that is important. and do NOT under any circumstances put it in the dryer.this really is a lifesaver. when we accidentally shrank our first one (see dryer note above) i just about cried... it's that important."
4,"an overview of ""on time"" and how it came to be","Before reading this book I did not know that daylight savings time started and ended on a different schedule each year; I did not know that Arizona and Indiana don't participate; I did not know that it was the work of the devil. This book tells the story of the development of synchronized time around the world, and particular in the United States along with a detailed look at all aspects of daylight saving time. While at times the book seems repetitive (because the arguments for and against daylight saving time are, in fact, repetitive) it was interesting and easy to read.This is an excellent book for the student and researcher, but also well-written for the casual reader who is just curious about how we ended up being ""in time"" with everyone else."
5,doctrinal details of the plan of salvation : from premortality to exaltion,"Great book with lots of info! It's easy to read. I learned a lot, and enjoyed reading it. give it a try!."
1,Not for everyone,Right wing religious types who believe that all billion Muslims in the world are terrorists will like this book. People who can spell xenophobic will probably find it less interesting.
4,good loppers,I wanted a heavy duty pair with larger cut capacity. These are a good pair not quite as heavy duty as expected. I gave them 4 stars because they were not sharp at all when they arrived and they seem to flex alot when I cut a larger hardwood limb. The price was better than I expected to pay. overall good for a homeowner plus some but probably not daily arborist/landscaper tool.
4,"Wow, now how old are these kids again?","This album is very, very impressive. The kids are 17 at the time of its release, or so that is what I have heard. It is vocally strong, but the recording is poor so the music just doesn't meet up to perfect. This is an impressive album, but not a must get."
4,"Nice! Try this group, it's worth it!","The first album of this norse group is nice, not thrilling like the other one but... there is something in it. All fans must have a ear upon this one."
5,Unbelievably beautiful!,"I heard the Ave Maria in Doc Cheng's restaurant at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Didn't know what it was, but was mesmerized by it! Really beautiful synthesis of classical and pop."
5,My Bad Luck Soul,"This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home."
2,Flimsy and prone to cracking,"I bought this carrier as a last minute solution to carrying a Jerry Can on an offroad trip a few years back. It is mounted using the 4 dimpled bolt holes to my aftermarket swingout tire carrier on my SUV. It is only used on trips where I need extended range and so far it has been loaded for 4 off-road expeditions. Last weekend after returning from an off-road trip I removed the gas can and noticed the carrier had ripped apart on one side around the top bolt hole where it had been dimpled and cracked around the other top hole. This carrier is flimsy and made from thin metal, not heavy-gauge as stated and not made to stand up to off-road use. I will not be buying another but instead will fabricate my own out of some thicker steel made to last. It did work good for those 4 uses and the red finish still looks good after being outside for about 2 years."
4,as advertised,"these carriers are as advertised. and are made in the USAI haved taken them on any backcountry trips yet, so only timewill tell how they hold."
5,The way live should be,I read the other review and totally disagree this cd is great and a must have. The stenght of his voice is fantasic. The rendition of the songs are different than the 45s but if you want to hear the songs that way there are other great albums. This is live baby with heart and soul!
5,Starsailing,"Spacious sounds and endless psychedelic washes, delivered with a feel and intensity unwitnessed since the release of ""a Storm in Heaven""."
2,Where are the women?,"Although Mahmoud makes fine arguments about Muslim women and she questions the inevitability/desirability of secularism for all peoples, her pure pleasure in wielding theory outweighs ""the stuff"" of the book. This reader came away wondering who, other than the author, actually inhabits the book. Certainly there were memorable women whose stories were edited out in favor of discussions about western theoreticians. Mahmood's audience cannot include students; they are mystified. This is a shame because perhaps there is no subject that begs more for good, clear writing by scholars than works about Muslim women."
3,Ok product if indoors,"This is a excellent product if it is going to be placed indoors, such as a garage. I had placed this storage container in a outdoor storage shed and had major problems with ants. Since moving it to the garage, I haven't had any more problems. I have used these to store dog food, cat litter and dog treats. They have served their purpose. Only downside is that the lid doesn't fit tighter. I have used both the 100 and the 40."
1,Sent wrong parts,"I attempted to get a metal gas can spout, but received a plastic one which would not fit. I reverted back with the error, and stated I did not want the wrong part. They sent me the same wrong part again. I never did receive what I ordered so refuse to pay for it."
4,A Musical Genius,I first heard the song on General Hospital and thought that Michael Saucedo was amazing. His voice empowers the song not to mention the rhythm of the music. I think he is talented and will soon surpass everyone's expectations.
4,very comfortable,"Very comfortable to wear, but the soles seem a little plasticy and hard, so when you walk, they clip clip clip along, not quiet like a good soft rubber sole. I have had them for 3 weeks now, and they are not getting any quieter, as I hoped they would."
5,Metal container(s) not included,"This seems to work quite good but the product is not entirely as pictured.The product is a gray cardboard box (pictured) with a cloth bag inside filled with silica pellets, the box has a hole on the front, rear, and 3 on the bottom for viewing the included quality indicator papers.

2,Needs better discussion,"This book is very well illustrated and has answers to problems ( numbers only) at the end of the book. Several examples are worked out in each section, a definate plus. As the book progresses, these sample problems increasingly fail to represent the problems in the section. The discussion are poor. Material is presented in short,brief, nearly bulleted lists. Little attempt at theoretical expansion is made, and then more problems are thrown at you. For the average student who really doesn't care about learning only getting grade, this book will work out fine. If you are more serious about learning, look for another book. I am. The examples and illustrations alone are worth buying the book if you can find a used copy at low cost somewhere."
5,This is an excellent book!,"This is the best book I have used in any engineering class. The text is clear and well-written, not long-winded or confusing. The book also contains many examples of each principle, fully worked out, along with a huge number of problems with the answers provided. This is a superb introductory test to mechanics."
2,Not Sturdy Enough,"My husband bought the GroWorks Garden Cart (Product #62301) for me last May since I love working in the garden but have difficulty with stooping and kneeling due to arthritis in the knees. Unfortunately, by September I could no longer use it as a garden stool as the lid was beginning to warp and would no longer close properly. If there is a weight limit, it should be noted in the ad. Perhaps it is only meant for infrequent use, and not for the person who gardens every day that the weather allows!GroWorks Garden Cart"
1,joystick does not move in direction pushed,"I got the V-Smile for my 3 year old son for Christmas because my niece had introduced him to video games and, if he was going to play them anyway, I wanted them to be educational. The V-Smile games are great, if short. However, the joystick is almost impossible to use. No matter which way you push the controller, you can never tell which direction the character is going to move. This is VERY frustrating and my son will only play for a few moments before giving up and asking to play Nintendo instead."
4,2 players= 2 joysticks,"I read one of the earlier reviews that suggested not to get the second joystick, but I ended up buying it anyway. I am so glad I did for several reasons:1. you cannot select 2 players w/o having a second controllerplugged in.2. not having to pull one child off the system to allow the other child to have a turn.We have almost every game for this system, and now both children can enjoy it:)"
2,Disappointed,"I like the video system, but most of the games we have don't have the option of playing with two players. The only game we have that allows this option is the game that came with the system."
2,JOYSTICK DILEMA,"I BOUGHT THE V.SMILE SYSTEM FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS THE GAMES ARE EDUCATIONAL AND SHE ENJOYS THE SYSTEM BUT IM DISSAPPOINTED THAT THE JOYSTICK HAS MALFUNCTIONED SO QUICKLY MY DAUGHTER GETS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE SHE CAN'T MOVE LEFT,RIGHT,UP OR DOWN. I E-MAILED VTECH WITH THE PROBLEM AND STILL HAVE NOT GOT A RESPONSE FROM THEM ITS GOING TO COST ME $14 PLUS SHIPPING TO PURCHASE ANOTHER JOYSTICK WITH THE HOPES THAT IT WILL WORK AND NOT MALFUNCTION LIKE THE FIRST ONE"
2,V-Smile Joystick piece of junk,"When the joystick works it is a fun gaming system. However, these joysticks are a piece of junk. My boys had gotten 2 V-Smile systems at Christmas time which each came with 2 joysticks and at this point in time NONE of them work. My boys take excellent care of their games and we have never had problems like this with anything. The first two just decided not to work and then yesterday when they went to use the other two controllers they had ceased to work as well about a month after the first two quit. That is 4 joysticks that are totally useless. My boys really didn't even get a lot of usage out of the V-Smiles because they only play games now and then. I am a very disappointed customer."
5,Nelco ddiscus,This is a fine discus and I wish your company offered the nelco gold 1.6k also at this price. This the lowest price I have ever located on a discus of this quality.
3,OK,"These containers work well with some storage applications, but dumping a full bag of food can be challenging. The opening is awkward and I always end up with some food spilled out on the floor when I fill it. The stacking capability is really nice though, and the doors open perfectly when there is one on top of the other. Overall, not a bad product, but the filling issue bothers me. Also, it is not air tight, so I wouldn't use it for long term storage of perishable items. Great for toys, grooming stuff, etc."
3,Needs a longer hose.,"I wanted a lightweight easy to carry vac for couches, baseboards, etc.. I have found the suction and weight of this vac o.k., but the hoses and attachments are lacking. My main complaint is that the hose is too short and there is no longer stiff barrel attachment. Since the hose is flexible it must be held at the end, So I have to be constantly bent over or crawling on the ground. It can only reach as far as my arm can reach. It is actually easier to get my big heavy regular vac out that has a longer stiffer hose and lug it around the house."
4,A Dash of Style.,"I loved the book, A Dash of Style: The Art and Mastery of Punctuation.As a creative writer I've always been a bit confused as to where to place the comma. I had to bluntly admit to my editor, ""I simply do not know how to place punctuation."" We worked side by side as we completed the layout and design of my book.Sacred Shadow, Sacred Ground: A Vietnam War Widow's Journey Through Unresolved GriefI always concentrated more on content of the written word. A Dash of Style, is a book that I find easy to read and understand.I have a lot of work to do in order to apply the information, but I am eager to experiment with the art of punctuation. I think this book is an important read, especially for the creative writer."
3,Smaller than expected,"This bag was slightly smaller than expected. It's call a laptop bag, but it would be a tight fit (or impossible) for most standard sized laptops. I didn't buy it for this purpose, so it's not a big deal for me. I have had it for awhile now, and the quality of the product is holding up, although it is showing a little wear and tear. Overall satisfied with the product."
1,An Affront to God and the Record-buying Public,"I don't even know how to start this. I'd like to note that I do not own this CD. However, someone, who shall remain nameless because they are so pathetic that they own a Bruce Willis ""Ultimate Collection"" that does not contain any movies, I know does. In the course of my life, I've had the supreme displeasure of listening to this. I'm not totally sure what ol' ""Bruno"" did to this music, but by God, my ear were ready to start ripping themselves off my head. It was so awful. Honestly, this CD doesn't even have a genre; I don't mean this in the cool way (i.e. Beck is a transgenre magician of music). I mean it in a something awful way. What's truly shocking is that this piece of trash with no melody, no soul, no voice, and nothing extraordinary, can be sold for such a horrible price. I maintain that anyone who buys this ""Ultimate Collection"" should be made into Soylent Green."
1,Pretty bad,"This is a CD of original unremixed Moby, back from when he called himself Voodoo Child. It's pretty bad - Have you Seen My Baby is decent, but overall it's not a good CD. It's interesting to compare to his newer stuff (like Play), as you can definitely hear some of his influences, however he simply wasn't a good producer at the time in which he made these songs."
4,mandolin Italiano,This was what it said mandolins. Good sound and quite authenticalmost like the Plazas of Roma and Napoli. One of the better cds of Italian music.
5,It's that MOB Thang,"Hey I just want to let the rest of the world know that NYKE LOC, TWIZZ, MO HEAT, MO, and the rest of the STR8 CHECK'N crew is the hottest hip-hop gangsta ... on the BLOCC. Let me tell you to go and get that ... if you don't got it. Be on the look-out for the new stuff..."
4,"Some nice pieces, not quite infectious","I bought this product out of curiosity and interest in Greek music, language and culture. I understand that it is a good reflection of all of the above, but the selection wasn't as infectious as I had hoped. The opening numbers are gorgeous with a sort of Mediterranean pathos, but over all it did not grasp me. The Rough Guide series still holds my respect and admiration especially for their authenticity. I especially loved the Guide to the Music of Venezuela."
4,Great CD track listing incorrect,"I would first like to echo the other reviews that this is a great CD and worth getting. The music is soulful and will add something unique to your music collection. However, I was surprised when I got my CD and found out that Paul's cover of RJ's Terraplane Blues was not on the CD and replaced by his song Gonna Move. I already have his CD New Train, so this is a wasted track for me and I don't believe the song was even in the movie. It is a great song, but sticks out on the CD as it has a vastly different feel from the other tracks. I was looking forward to hearing Terraplane Blues and it is even mentioned in the description. It is a little bit of false advertising and Amazon should update the track listing if it was changed for some reason. I would have gotten the CD anyway without Terraplane, but was looking forward to hearing it again and was disappointed it wasn't included. Just be warned that the track listing is incorrect."
5,Genghis Blues,"I got the soundtrack after seeing the film of the same name which had come as a breath of fresh air.It's great to hear some honest, uncontrived music performed by masters in their craft.If you've ever doubted the concept of universality or interconnectedness then these guys of such different cultural and geographical origins could change your view.There's a rare lot of heart in this album."
2,EMOTIONAL DISCONNECT,"I was led to this artist via someone's ""Greatest of...."" list on Amazon. I listened to the short clips: nice voice, minimalist arrangments. I bought it. Then when I listened, I discovered the tunes are standards done from a same sex perspective. That totally alienated any emotional investment I could make in listening to this CD. Buyer beware. I felt like this was an under the radar zing. I tossed it and gave my wife the empty jewel case to replace a broken one on her Percy Faith CD. 2 stars because of the fine voice."
1,waste of money,I am returning this item. The backs are hollow and the cans are super thin. They will be smashed in a matter of minutes. I thought that this set looked nice but after opening it I realized that it was not good at all. If the set had been a lot cheaper I might keep it but I would like to get something better with the money I spent for it. I got a great set for half the price from Learning Resources on a different site. Good Luck.
4,"Fun for little kids! Cost-friendly, Kid-friendly","Perfect for my daycare kids. They love the variety of foods in this set. A ton of pieces and endless possiblities! I have two sets and for the price, it is worth it!"
3,"Great Packaging, so-so sound quality","Music legends gather for a a once in a lifetime star studded Rockabilly jam with the great Carl Perkins. This soundtrack is from a cable special that originally aired in the 80's. I've deducted stars because the recording sounds like it was dubbed right off the film/video, so it's not too good. Perhaps this is the best that could be produced from the original source available. On the other hand, the packaging is excellent and there are plenty of liner notes.There is so much energy and good playing on this cd. Dave Edmunds, George Harrison, Ringo,and Eric Clapton pay due reverence to the rockabilly icon that helped pave the way for artists like Roy Orbison and Elvis. It's a shame that a better recording is not available, so this will have to do.."
4,Adorama Step up ring,"It does its function. Although the ring itself feels and looks a bit fragile. Adorama did a very fast delivery and I recommend purchasing from them.I bought the ring in order to use 72mm filters on my 35-70mm lense, which uses 62mm filters; thus saving in double expense protecting both lenses."
1,False advertising,"The product info doesn't state that this divider works ONLY on their bar. All other bars are round and this doesn't work at all. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it, postage, etc."
5,Nice work,"Succeeding to the book by T.Valone, ""Electrogravitics systems"", this is a nice pack of discovories on the Biefeld-Brown effect, which also contains the scientific validation conducted by different research teams in the world. It might be very helpful for reserchers to make further investigations on the electro-gravitic effect."
4,Just bought my second pair!,"I love these shoes. This is the second pair I've gotten b/c I wore the first pair out! I've never sought out to purchase the same pair of shoes but I just couldn't find ones that I liked as much...and this is coming from someone who owns at least eleven pairs of black shoes. I will admit at first they hurt but after two wears they should be good to go. I find them true to size. I wear them with jeans, slacks, dresses, etc. and I always get complements on them. They give you height without pitching you forward."
1,Album Blows. Group Blows.,"I had to review this album after reading the other reviews. Everyone is entitled to listen to whatever they like and I am sure I listen to music that others would never listen to. That being said I have tried to listen to this album multiple times and it is just awful. This must be for young kids who are just discovering metal. There are so many new bands out now that are much better. And the comparison to Slipknot is ridiculous. Slip's first album was ok, nothing more. Now Slipknot pretty much blows as hard as Shroomhead. Nu-Metal needs to go the way of Grunge. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a group that is worth it."
4,Magic Mushrooms,"I'm gonna start by saying anyone who says Mushroomhead [...] Slipknot can [...] off now. I think Slipknot are great, but Mushroomhead started years before they did and people who slate them for copying should check their facts. Ok, rant over. This is Mushroomhead's first major release, and its amazing. I first heard them on Kerrang! tv with the video for 'Solitaire/Unraveling', and I wasn't impressed. But I got persuaded by a friend to listen more and it really grew on me, so I decided to try the album. Be warned 12 year olds in Linkin Park hoodies, this will not impress you. 'XX' has a couple of nu-metally songs, such as 'Before I Die', but it is mostly slower, but equally explosive prog metal. The pick of the tracks are 'Solitaire...', 'Before I Die', 'Never Let Go' and the amazingly weird hidden version of 'Bwomp'. Mushroomhead are a truly original band and nothing you will find sounds anything like them. Plus they kick [...] live!"
1,Do not leave out in cold weather with a load on them!,"I'm writing this review as a warning to other owners. I would have gave these saw horses a more favorable review, but my pair was destroyed when I left them out in cold weather with about a 300 pounds load. These saw horses worked fine all summer and fall, but after a cold snap in early winter I found them laying on the ground in pieces. I believe one of the lower brackets snap, then the load shifted, and the whole thing came down. I believe the cold weather is the main reason the plastic shattered in so many pieces.Please note that Amazon technical specs claim the sawhorse(one or pair?) can hold 2500 pounds, while Stanley's website claims they can hold 2900 pounds per pair. I would not trust either of these numbers! I'd like to know who did their ratings. They certainly must have been done under ideal conditions."
4,Good as it gets...,"Overall fairly steady and well made considering their primarliy made from plastic. I have some concerns about the potential for the feet breaking or cracking but have had no problems at this point. One note, you can purchase these individually for $35 each at Home Depot which is considerably lower then Amazon's current price."
2,Sub-par,"I'm a tenor who use pc to record my vocal. This mic is just so-so, slightly better than a chat-mic. My major complaint about it is that it apparently does not have a 'pop' filter that reduces explosive noise due to proximity and breathing. If you're serious about getting your vocal performance recorded nicely, this mic is not for you."
1,Not the quality I was looking for,"I purchased this microphone & I am returning it the same day. I was looking for a microphone that would work with my pc & had a little better quality than the standard ones you get with a new computer. Sound coming from this was so lo, windows couldn't even detect a voice being transmitted.Can't complain too much, it was less than $10. I have not tried this product with other devices. I use my pc for all of my recording."
4,d.trucks,raw sound absolutely live this cd confirms derek trucks as the best young guitar player in the world has this man any limits great
3,Not as good as hoped for!!,I heard about this c.d.from a friend who read about it in Guitar Player Mag. He said they gave it a thumbs up and I went and order it.Frist 2 or 3 songs were rocking but it went down hill from there.It started draging and kept draging for the rest of the CD. John Popper`s harp playing and voice didn`t help either.I had more than enough of that in Blues Traveler. I`m a big fan of blues rock but this one let me down big time
5,Just awesome,This a great side project band... jimmy and popper works great together. To me this is an essencial record!.
4,Bride of the Lion,"This is the first of her books that I have read. I highly recommend it. The first couple of chapters are not up to the writing skill portrayed in the rest of the book. I was not able to put it down, once I got into the story. Strong characterizion and plot according to historical time frame. Good reading."
4,Nightingale's Lament,"I gave this book four stars, not because the writing isn't amazing, but because of the shortness of the book. His series is so captivating, and I want more from the books. Excellent overall!"
5,Couldn't out it down!,"I love this book, and the whole series. I had read the other three pretty quickly, however, for some strange reason, I was hesitant to read this one. Took me a few months to pick it up. I start this book about 5 days ago, and finished it last night at 1:30 am! I read 130 pages that night! I just couldn't stop! It was so great and I can't wait to read the last three. John Marsden is such a genius in his writing. Though this book didn't have as much action as the previous ones, it was still very fulfilling and worth my time. I bet the next three will be the best!"
4,I finished the series....,"I've read all seven! Fellow Americans, eat your heart out. I found #6 at Amazon.com.uk. And was in Australia early this month when #7 had just arrived in a bookstore. Anyway, once you start you'll probably read all seven of the ""Tomorrow"" books. You may stumble on some of the Australian terms (chook for chicken). And the Aussie approach to some things about which we are still puritanical is sorta fun."
2,"Some nice tracks, some horrible mixing","One transition was rough (from 4 to 5). Then the next one was rougher (from 5 to 6). Then another that sounded like it got brought in too late (from 7 to 8). Then that one that will leave you with a BIG ""WTF was that!??!?!??""(from 8-9). Started off promising with some dope rolling bass and sonic boom type tracks, but as tracks started going elsewhere is when the mixing also starts going bad. Next you get some florida/miami bass style stuff that's more thumpy than boomin. Things end off in a jungle vibe.Mostly this is one of those CDs that you pull tracks from to buy for your own DJ mix. As far as repeated listenings to it for the DJ mix.......no (well maybe just the first few tracks)."
3,For the advanced or precocious student,"I am not crazy about this book. It does have some terrific points and points of view about handling the mutations and regional dialects, and as the other reviewer said it is not for the beginners. It covers a lot of points and details in what really is not a large volume, but they are points and details that I think should have been titled something other than ""Basic Welsh."" ""Details of Modern Welsh"" might be a better description. This might be a good candidate for an audiobook instead of text, for some of us. I am both a beginner and not really... I have been poking at the language off and on for twenty years or so. The best books I have found for beginners are actually booklets put out by Teledu BBC Cymru called Dechrau Siarad Starting to Speak Welsh. I also have enjoyed a booklet called Speak Welsh, by Gwen Pritchard Jones. Unfortunately these little booklets can be hard to come by. A nice fat dictionary is also invaluable."
2,Good product cheap plug,"Purchased one of these at TA truck stop. Seemed well built and got hot, but the plug is very cheap and would not stay in the recepticle. Any little movement of the cord or unit and the plug would either fall out or loose connection. Tried every plug in the truck (5) and was the same in all of them. Had it 10 minutes and returned it. If i can find a better quality plug I will cut the factory one off and put on the better quality one."
5,Beautiful,I loved this Precious Moments figurine since I saw it. It represents such a unique and beautiful moment in a person's life. I fits perfectly in my hutch.
5,An Excellent Resource for Digital Media Enthusiasts,"From Futurist Cinema, to artificial intelligence, to cyberspace, this collection highlights the origins of multimedia, its influences, its directions, and its future possibilities. It includes an insightful and comprehensive introduction by Packer and Jordan themselves, and the authors they have chosen to include in this work reflect the vast landscape of multimedia in its many iterations: Vannevar Bush, William Gibson, Norbert Wiener, John Cage, and Janet Murray, just to mention a few. This book is a must-have for anyone interested in peeking below the surface of multimedia evolution."
5,Excellent Visual Companion to WWI,"With all due respect to the man from BC, Columbia, this is an excellent book. If you are a visual person you will love this book. It is full of photos, maps, personal histories and letters. Yes, he is correct, there are some errors present, but nothing so significant that it takes away from this wonderful book.The price on Amazon is only $27, not $60, so go ahead put it on your wish list, it really is a great book!"
1,Not as good as I hoped...,It started working fine after waiting forever to charge it for the first time. Won't charge anymore and won't work! Didn't get much use out of it either! Not worth the price!
2,Don't waste your money,"What a disappointment. First of all, it doesn't have enough power. Applying any kind of pressure will bring the rotating action to a stop. Second, the charge only lasts about 20 minutes. And third, the attachments or ""bits"" are cheaply made. The flat discs are worthless for filing but do a great job of leaving a dark residue on your skin. (Like the kind you get when polishing metal). The 2 cutting type bits wore down to useless after minimal usage. Same with the cone shaped bit. I would rate this as 2 (at best) out of 5."
5,The kids love it,"I bought this for my nieces and nephew - they love it, and always want to listen to it. Upbeat, fun, great message."
5,Peter White by Candlelight,"This is an exceptional group of recordings by Peter White. I first heard cut #11 ""My Cherie Amour""on Serius Sat. radio and discussed it with other audio and acoustic people, we all agreed this is anoutstanding version of the song, the acoustic harmony is a gem to listen to. Al D."
3,OKish,"Doesn't match the P3600 screen size, so you have to pick one side and sacrifice it to the dirt gods.The covered part of it does the job well. Easy to write, type, click and it's pretty clear."
5,Jeep Wrangler,I bought this for my son's birthday. He is a Jeep 'nut' and loves the book. I recommend this book highly.
3,GOOD ONLY IF YOU WATCH THE FIRST 2 THIRDS OF IT.,"A lame ending can ruin a good movie and a terrific ending can save a mediocre one. But an ambiguous ending just plain irritates me. Either the filmmaker didn't have the guts to commit himself or he just wasn't up creatively to the job. Good actors and an interesting plot but no ending isn't artistic, it is just an incomplete script."
5,WOW. Great new features.,"I love the new exposure and gama correction tools as well as the perspective filter. This application did cause me to do a complete system overhall but NOW my Mac runs like an Olympian. The more robust and powerful this application gets, the more taxing it is on your system. A few things have chaged, such as how you link and select layers but after getting used to it I believe it is an improvement. Adobe Bridge (the replacement for the file browser) is an awsome application too, allowing you to run batches in both Illustrator and InDesign as well as Photoshop. You can preview documents in most formats also. As a professional designer and photographer this application is indespensible."
2,"Not really a 1"" spacer","This isn't really a 1"" spacer. It's sloped, about 5/8ths of an inch on one side and 1"" on the other. The title is very misleading.It's a moderately strong plastic, I was able to use a saw and a sander to make the spacer an even 5/8th of an inch which worked for me, but if you need a real 1"" of clearance look elsewhere."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The picture of these diamonds is very,very misleading. If you are not a diamond expert and don't know what the clarity and and color codes really mean don't trust the picture. These things look like dull glass. Bought them as a Christmas gift for my wife and I am sending them back. Again don't let the pictures fool you."
3,Good but perhaps great with the right player,"We were looking for something with enough imaging to really set off Klipsch speakers, and I thought we would be able to achieve that aim with an SACD disk in a blu ray player. I seem to have been wrong. The recording, perhaps because it's not in an SACD player, is not as crisp as one would like. Still, crisp or not, the music is splendid. Do yourself a favor and refresh your memory of the story behind it before you listen."
1,All about recording cannons - nothing about music,"For starters Tchaikovsky's wonderful opening with the 'cellos and violas is replaced with a chorus in the wrong octave, and later on a children's chorus chimes in, replacing the treble instruments. The cannons go very realistically BOOM, and the bells clang loud and strong, but so what? More chorus at the end on top of the cannons and chimes - shame on you Mr. Kunzel. I enjoyed hearing my speakers reproduce the cannons and bells, but I longed for the impression made at Tanglewood with the cannons outside the shed and the percussionists pounding away on real bells.Don MacCourt (a professional musician)"
1,Far from Home,"I have a lot of Respect for Deepak Chopra. He is someone who is helping to open people to God. However I find in this book more a touch of commercialism than usual. I don't feel he is a very sincere student of the Kabbalah but more of a cashing in on a subject that can make money. Sorry Deepak, have to say we were very dissappointed in you efforts on the subject."
1,very dissapointed indeed......,"I have much respecet for Deepak Chopra, but this card set is shallow and not well thought out. It confuses a deeper Kabala understanding, and was a total waste of money."
2,Pigs Don't Fly,"I did enjoy reading this book. I found the story engaging, as well as the characters. However, I felt that at some point near the end of the story, the author must have hit a wall, and was floundering for ideas. I felt that the story took a turn for the worse, and once I finished the book, I was left unsatisfied, and feeling cheated, that perhaps she just wanted to finish the story and be done with it."
3,"not great, but entertaining","Best known as co-creator of Twin Peaks, Mark Frost puts his taste for the surreal to work as a storyteller in the Umberto Eco vein. In The List of Seven, he made Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a fictional hero à la Sherlock Holmes, blending history and mystery into a fast-paced occult thriller.The Six Messiahs catches up with Doyle ten years later, on his first visit to America. By abandoning foggy England for the wide-open West, Frost loses much of List's dense, gothic charm; luckily, the new book is still packed with appealing (as well as appalling) characters and mystic twists.Like its predecessor, The 6 Messiahs straddles the gap between capital-L Literature and the popular thriller. This is a shaky position, but it yields a lot of fun. You could do far worse than this rollicking entertainment."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"I was very excited about this book after reading 'List of Seven' but it fell short to say the least. It seemed like Frost was reaching for a story line because it had very little substance. There were new charaters that had very little background. One the important charaters didn't fit at all and the ending was poor.It was very disjointed and the twist to Jack's character seemed out of context. What happened, Mr. Frost?!"
2,You know what they say about sequels...,"Not nearly as good as the List of 7. Sparks's fall is disappointing and, I think, unnecessary to the story. It really takes away from him being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes."
1,Known defective merchandise shipped,"The white box had ""send to QA"" written on it in ink. When I took the lantern out of the case the handle pin was laying in the case. On the instruction sheet someone had circled the defective area with a highlighter pen. Obviously, this was a returned product that found it's way back out the door.I found the u-shaped locking piece. I tried to replace the pin, but every time I moved the handle the locking piece would pop out. Very poor handle attachment. I also don't see how it could be waterproof where the handle is connected!"
4,Cute little clock!,"Loved giving this to my boyfriends mom as a gift for Christmas. We haven't been able to get it to chime, however... Nonetheless, still looks nice on the wall and keeps time...."
4,Solid cozy mystery,"This was not as good as her knitting mysteries that feature Kelly in the same town. I didn't think the characters or plot was as interesting or fun. I would definitely recommend reading her other series and this one will also give an enjoyable afternoon read if you liked the others, but you just won't adore the characters as much. It was also much more expensive as it was printed in hardcover while her other series is all paperback. And if an author is going to set two series in the same town, we could at least periperially meet some of the other characters and/or sites. And the even the sam type of dog...."
2,Not sure how this would work,"I am not sure how well these would work at all, seeing that donuts are fried not bakednice idea though,hope they can come up with a product that works well."
2,Anime Review,"The story is a bit drawn out throughout this entire series making it difficult to enjoy. This series was not worth the amount of money I spent, also there is a defect in disc number 5. I enjoy watching all foreign films and animation in their original language. Disc number 5 would not let me select Japanese as the spoken language, but would allow me to select English subtitles. I say buy the live action movie Shinobi and save yourself some time and money."
2,Looked good but was sorely disappointed,"The reviews and specifications for these headphones looked good, but I was disappointed with the product. If I were in the return for credit time period, I would be sending them back. They were better than the dirt-cheap headphones that came with my walkman, but the distortion happens at very moderate volume. I bought them for $18, now they are $12 which indicates they're trying to get rid of this marginal product. Don't waste your cash."
4,Ultralight receiver,"This is a bit bulky compared to my old ultralight collar I bought 8 years ago, which by the way still works and uses a regular 2032 calculator battery. It's too bad they changed the battery on the new ones. I compared the ultralight collar to the small dog collar and didn't see a whole lot of size difference. The price of the ultralight is considerably less, however. Works well on my pomeranian. Seems to give more of a buzz than a shock. Does not have correction levels like the old collar does. I have an indoor radio fence receiver in the house to keep them out of the living room, and the same collars work for the outdoor radio fence. Pretty nifty, I think."
3,PetSafe Radio Fence review,"This is a good product, but I might be more inclined to get thestronger collar next time."
5,Great CD,"This is a wonderful CD to listen to, very calming. I listen to it on my way to work and it sticks in my mind. I will catch myself humming one of the songs while I am working. I am so glad I purchased this one. I have listened to several other of his CD's they are all good but this one really hits home for me."
4,Coffee on the Fly,"I got this for my father who loves coffee and drives an 18 wheeler for a living. He says that it makes great coffee and loves it.It did blow a fuse so, keep some 20A glasses fuses around. I think it was a good buy."
3,frustrating fun,"Moto GP does an admirable job of balancing arcade and sim elements in a motorcycle racing game. This, however, will drive you mad- the learning curve is steep enough that arcade racing fans may give up on it, but at the same time, the adjustments that you make to tune your bike to the course don't seem to do anything at all. The graphics are GEORGEOUS. This is the first game I've ever played where I would actually sit through the replay mode. I've seen races on TV that didn't look this good. The tracks(only five of them!!) are very realistic, but don't be surprised when the AI bikes just ram you out of the way when they want to pass. Overall, I'd say this game was worth a rental."
1,horrible quality,Mic is very bad quality. Very light compared to others I have. It feels like a toy mic that belongs to a cheap toy keyboard.
1,Not so good,This microphone does not work well. You have to hold your hand around it to make your voice heard through the speakers. The worst singer gets the bad microphone. I will buy another kind soon because this will not last.
1,"poor quality, not even good to use as a toy!","I bought this to use as a second microphone for the kids' karaoke machine so two could sing together. I thought the ""quality"" of the sound wouldn't matter since I was just buying it to use it with my kids toy. Boy was I wrong. The kids fight over using the other one that came with the karaoke singing machine, which is far superior. This one is really a piece of crap and they can barely hear themselves singing when they use it. Don't buy it for any reason. It stinks!"
2,Sony Omnidirectional Microphone for Computer Review,Sound was poor and didn't configure to the online karaoke site and was very difficult to get a spot where your sound would come through strong...it was weak!
3,You get what you pay for.,"Can't really complain, it was 8.Plugged it in to my Hifi and it is only audible if I cup my hands around it.Plugged through a pre-amp first (I used a guitar amp) it is a lot better but the sound quality isn't brilliant.Mostly plastic but not built terribly. If you can afford something better then don't get this."
4,Great Mic,"Just what the doctor called for , did what I needed for a great price , light weight , good pick up , good from Pc to sterioSony Omnidirectional Microphone"
2,Sony Mic,"This product was delivered on time and I was happy to open it and get it working. However, once I plugged in I found that this mic is very weak and you have to scream to get any sound out of it. I don't like this item, but do not fault the company that delivered it for this."
1,very cheap,i was not impressed by this product at all. i thought since it was sony it would be good but clearly not.
2,no title,"Started out promising, but disintegrated into the unbelievable. Author was only 26 and wildly romantic. Supposedly she herself suppressed this book's publication in England because the two lovers - Julian and Eve - were really herself and a childhood friend, Violet Keppel, whom she ran away with. She writes well, but characters just aren't full enough."
2,never got it,"I kept on receiving emails pushing back the date of delivery. After 4 of these notices, almost 1 month later, I was then informed that the product is no longer available. Although I was very excited about the kitchenaid at first, (my mom has one over 20 years old and it's still going strong), I am sad to say that I will never see the kitchenaid I ordered for myself."
5,"Great Product, Greaaaat Price, Only in AMAZON","I love it!!! I got it for a very great price especially when i got 30 dollars off when i applied for amazon visa card, they will also send me a 20 dollars Amazon gift card in few weeks since i bought it in july when they had that promotion. at kitchenaid.com it costs 239.99!!!Anyway, I love the pizza dough i made, whole wheat bread, mashed potatoes...I take care of it, i don't wash the bowl and the hooks in the dishwasher even if it's safe to but the wire whisk.Thank you Kitchenaid,Thank you Amazon"
5,Great Mixer,"I am very happy with this mixer. I am taking a cake decorating class and needed a mixer with power. A Kitchen Aid was recommended by the instructor and a few of the students. So I started searching the internet and then remembered Amazon.com. Was I ever glad...not only was it on sale, but there was also another 25$ off. I saved at least 70$. Today the Kohl's ad had them on sale for 169.HA I paid 99$....Thanks amazon....It was there quickly and I was able to start using this great mixer right away. It is so easy to clean, and fun to use. It is very heavy so I made a place on my counter, and it stays out...."
5,Excellent product,"It's a rare occasion nowadays that you buy a product that not only works as advertized, but has a high-quality appearance and build as well as goes the extra mile with accessories. The kit contains everything you might need to hang up a flat panel TV, and comes to detailed instructions."
5,sanusa flat wall mount,"Great Product, Easy to install, Looks good, and about $100 cheaper than in a store. Installed myself in about 1 hour, saved anther $250-400."
1,DIED after 4 months,i got this on october 30th and i used it for four months and the screen died on it.i would not reccommend it at all.a waste of money.
5,Sansa e260 4GB MP3 Player,"This was the best price I could find anywhere. They were fast with shipping. I love the MP3 player as it holds lots of music and pictures, plus has an FM radio."
5,Cheaper and Better thaniPod,"I purchased the Sansa e260 for my 16 year old daughter after her second iPod had been lost/stolen. I had owned and preferred Windows based mp3 players (Creative and Rio) but she bought into the hype and had to have an iPod. Over time, she started to get annoyed with iTunes and their ""exclusive"" music management system. Now that she has the Sansa she will never go back. You can use their music management software if you like, but you can also just cut and paste folders like any other windows storage device. It is far easier to use and more flexible. She loves the controls, the sound is great, and it is far less expensive than the annoying to use iPod. PLUS - the micro SD expansion slot is a great feature. For $13 we bought a card and added 2GB of space. We have not, to this point, used the video or photo feature so I can't speak to that. Overall, this is the 7th mp3 player we've owned in our household - it is a great device and a tremendous value."
1,Warning: Don't buy this,"So, I got the sansa for Christmas and was soo excited about it. My choices were between an ipod or this and i picked the sansa because you seemed to get more for your money. I did research and read fellow costumer reviews that told about their player freezing up. But I just brushed that off and figured it wouldnt happen to me. Well, I was WRONG. 3 days 9today) after I got it I was listening to it and it suddenly just froze up. It's still frozen, 4 hours later. I cant get it to do anything, even shut off.Even if it starts working again Im returning it. The buttons are hard to manage too. Im getting a refund and getting an Ipod.Final conclusion....DONT GET IT!"
3,Good for the price I suppose,"It's hard to complain as I haven't had any performnance issues, but man this thing is thick an bulky. It just wasn't as aesthetically pleasing as I thought it would from the photographs"
4,Much Cheaper than IPOD,"I bought this after I lost my previous MP3 player in a hotel. I have had very good experiences with it. The original ear phones weren't great and didn't last long. I use Sony earbuds. I'm anti-Apple and enjoy not paying the big bucks for nothing. The FM radio is a nice feature. I download files from NPR and load them to the MP3 and listen when I can. It is great for this. I also load my audiobooks to it from Audible. I actually own two of them; the second I bought when I thought me first was a goner but found it in the couch. I did buy the rubber cover and it makes it easier to keep track of. If you are totally clueless about downloading and uploading, this is probably not the player for you. My one complaint? No off timer for when I want to list to it when I go to sleep."
3,"Better than the Nano, still has issues though","This is a very good player, on the plus side, it has a good size screen for such a device so small, it plays video for those who want that (personally, the screen is too small for me), and best of all there is an active online community that use the player, and Sandisk has been cooperative with them, so Rockbox has been ported to the player, and there are also custom themes available to replace the kind of boring default theme. On the negative side, the sound quality may be better than an iPod, but it's not standing up to the players from companies Cowon or iriver. Also, the interface is laggy and with some annoyances. Overall, a nice player, but I'd probably look at Cowon, iriver, Meizu, or even Samsung if I had the whole thing to do over again."
4,"Easy to use, small","I bought this device because Sandisk has a good reputation, the price was better than an Ipod. The size, quality and design are excellent.I happy with this product, the battery can give you hours of music with no recharge.I use it on my car, actually, I don't charge it frequently.CONS: Doesn't come with wall charger, only usb option.Sansa works only with Rhapsody software (No itunes)"
4,A good player,"This player does its job - it plays music. I really like it.The good:1) Battery life. I've never run it out, but I'd say around 12 hours or so of music.2) It's tough. I haul it everywhere and I have yet to crack the screen.It didn't meet all my expectations though -1) you can't play it when it's plugged into the computer or a wall jack to charge it. That annoying. So if the battery goes out, you're stuck until it's charged2) It doesn't come with a wall charger.3) The menu is cumbersome.a) You cannot put presets into the radio. So just hope you like one station, or two that are close together on the dial.b) When playing stored music, one you have selected a song/album/playlist, if you want to go back, you have to go all the way back to the top menu, and work your way down again.c) Getting this thing to sync to WMP is a trick. It will take a few tries.4) The earbuds it came with were broken when I got it (the foam covers were torn in half.)"
5,great product,order 3 only problems with them is no manual but you can downlaod a pdf manual from sansa. 2 of the 3 downlaoded differenly don't know why. but a good mp3 player.
3,Unfourtunately mine was a dud.,I had to send mine back as it was not complete and did nto work. Amazon was great about the return. I would stick with ipod myself especialy if you want to use itunes.
4,Good player but is a disappointment,I bought this product because the 8 GB wouldn't work on my computer. My computer wouldn't recognize it at all. I have the same problem with the 4 GB. I can now only use it on my work computer. My home computer is fairly old and only has USB 1.1. I am not sure if that was the problem but that's what I blamed it on. My work computer is USB 2.0. The mp3 player works good but I don't like the ear phones. They do a horrible job of blocking out outside noise because they don't go inside your ear. I use some free no-name ear phones with it instead and they actually go into my ears and block out a lot more noise. The player also doesn't come with a CD like the 2 GB does. It also doesn't have USB modes. If you plan on buying this player I recommend that you either get a new computer or get a MAC. Apparently these things aren't compatible with older computers.
2,dissapointed,Arrived fast. Great sound. Worked well for a couple of weeks. Then unit malfunctions.It ramdomly shuts off or freezes. When this happens it takes a long time to get it back on & working again. I expected a much better product.
4,"Great product, lack accessories though....","After researching on MP3 players for several months, I finally decided to get the Sansa 4GB unit right around Christmas time and have been very satisfied with the product. It has great battery life, and it had never died on me, the music quality is great. The photo quality is also great. The scroll wheel can be improved though. I love the FM radio although sometimes reception is not that good. The only thing that I feel is that there isn't enough accessories that go w/ this product. If I had more accessories to choose, this would get a 5-star."
4,Good decision,"To the people who seem to have a problem with the wheel ""hurting their fingers,"" they need to seriously toughen up. It is true that the buttons may be difficult to press for people with large fingers, but I think that most peoples problems are user errors. People complained about having to press buttons twice, but that is because the first press bring the unit out of sleep mode. Just takes a little getting used to, but it works well.As for the one negative that I have found, I still cannot design my own playlists besides the ""GO list"" designed on the system. Songs must be added to the list individually to the list. I have not been able to load other set playlists on from my windows media player sync."
4,Solid Mp3 player,When I first bought this product it was pretty glitchy but I have had it for a month and it is working great. The videos look real good and the audio quaility is good. I was able to watch a full length movie on my trip home on the airplane. My favorite feature is the voice recorder. I have been able to record a large percentage of my professors lectures. One thing to be aware of you can only upload musice onto the sd expansion video and pictures have to be on the device itself. They dont make that clear but it really isn't all that bad.
4,Great player...but the earphones....,"I love this Sansa e260 4GB player. It looks great, works great, and is easy to negociate even for a not-so-young and not-so-techno-savvy person like me. Overall, a wonderful player at a better-than-ipod value. I also really like the way it downloads music so easily from my Windows Media Player. It's a piece of cake. One thing: I don't know if I have funny-shaped ears, but the earphones are really hard to fit and keep in, and they hurt after awhile. I don't know why they can't make better fitting, more comfortable earphones. So I bought the JBuds ear buds, which sound great (maybe better) and are so comfortable! I also bought the Sansa travel kit, which supplies nice protection and includes a decent leather skin for the player."
2,The Facts Quickly!,SanDisk Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot (Black)This thing was great when I bought it but the scroll wheel felt a bit clunky. Now a year later and the wheel barely works. The titles jump all over when you turn it and you can't seem to ever land on the artist you want.The good thing about this is the price but it's a disposable unit like your portable CD player from before.Surprised for SanDisk. They should stick to making flash drives.
1,Not Very Good,"This product freezes and is very very delicate even with the metal back. Remember the days when you could drop your walkman/CD player and it still works fine? If you drop this PRAY it works again without any problems. Doesn't interface well with computers either. I had to reboot my computer twice to get it to work right and sometimes the songs did not sync onto it even though WMP said it did. I should have listened to the people here before I bought it. But I was hard headed and bought it anyway inspite of what people said. I thought what they said would not happen to me, c'mon what are the odds. Bad move. When there are over 30 bad reviews on a product take the warning. I will never buy anything Apple but I must confess that the Apple Ipod is a sturdy good product. I'll try Sony now."
1,FAILED FIRST USE!,"I purchesed a Sansa SanDisk e260 music player & Cuisinart Coffee Grinder and they 'Both' Failed after the first use, 'NOT' even on Cup of Coffee did I get, and only One Battery Use till the Sansa SanDisk Failed too! Now having to figure out 'HOW' to get a Refund, Replacement or Repair of 'BOTH' Item's? ""That'll Be WORK & A Headach NOW too""!"
4,Awesome player,"This is an awesome player. Granted its thicker than the IPOD Nano, but that also makes it easier to handle. Its much easier to use than the IPOD with its proprietory music format and data transfer modes. The only complaint I have is that Sandisk does not provide a free USB power charger with it. This is a huge hindrance when travelling, and you'd need to buy one from the market. Its price should be discounted for when comparing with other players."
2,Reliability problem,"Worked well for about a year, then the sound jack failed because of known connection problem with the solder joints on the circuit board where the jack is under constant pressure from plugging in the headphones. Sansa should fix this defect. This is kind of important with a listening device!"
3,Happy and Dissappointed at the Same Time,"Regarding music, pictures, the voice and FM recorder, and the FM tuner, it works well. My only complaints with any of these aspects are that I can't customize the Genre that is applied to each artist or song, and I can't create multiple playlists.As for the video feature, this player requires Sandisk's Media Conversion software (which was not included) to load video (and pictures) into the player memory. Even when I use the SanDisk Media Conversion software that came with my son's SanDisk SDMX7-1024 Sansa c240 1 GB MP3 Player, I was not able to get the video to play. It works fine for displaying pictures, but when I go to the VIDEO folder on the player, it displays the word ""Empty"" even though the video is listed in the video folder of the player on my computer when I plug the player into my computer USB port.I have sent a question regarding this to SanDisk via their customer support website. We'll see how that goes."
3,"Good product, but...","This mp3 player, have the same problem like the others sandisk mp3 players, the problem with the FM radio is not good, other problem is, when read the mp3 files, if the tag song start with number (e.g. ""01 - abc band"") it fails in the reading, otherwise the software is easly to use, and have a good sound, and the video have a good resolution quality."
4,Great Value,"Works great - easy to navigate and upload songs to. However, it is an older model and does not support audio books (from audible or other places). Not a big minus but would have been good to know. The price per MB was the most attractive factor but I am glad the display turned out to be great, the navigation is easy and the song uploads are a breeze."
3,Unsure,"Some of the points in this book were good. I didn't mind the references to God or the 12 step program. What did bug me was that the author went on and on about keeping your nose out of other peoples business, even if its a friend who needs you."
5,Good advide,This is a great book. I buy them and give them to people who are strugeling with family issues.
5,Marvelous Marva -- Songs For New Age Sisters,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD because the Marvelous Marva Wright, sultry songstress of New Orleans belts out the blues as she has never done before in her new release, ""Let Them Talk"". Although... what is so strikingly dissimilar, is the posture of confidence that seems to permeate the bulk of the key selections contained in this CD. It is clear that Marva has found ""what she had been looking for""...a new and more confident self.I am proud of Marva Wright because in ""Let Them Talk"" she appears to be in celebration of new-age women who have found themselves, and are least concerned with what others might have to say. The songs truly represent women, who are no longer easy push overs, stooped over in despair due to one too many batterings. Marva Wright pops off strong, decided; some might consider it difficult, but she, like many of her next-century sisters, appears to have come into her own with strength; enough to handle the load and carry the weight."
1,Not worth the money,"This headset is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sound from the speakers is actually picked up by the microphone and makes using voice recognition software almost impossible. The noise canceling microphone is a joke. Unfortunately I can't return them because technically they are not defective, just poorly designed. I'm sticking with Sennheiser from now on."
1,Drop and give me twenty!,"Every month a new ""Army Men"" game is released, and for what? To sucker people into buying what looks like a decent game, but is in fact just the opposite. I felt terrible the other day when I saw a little boy buying this as he recited the series' tagline: ""Real combat, plastic men."" I couldn't save that kid, but hopefully I can save you from making a mistake. Please do not buy this for a friend or relative. Spare them. It's your duty, soldier."
2,Didn't like it,I'm not a fan of books that have a lot of flashbacks. This book was mostly all flashbacks with an abrupt ending.
3,Not up to his usual standards,"I've read all of the Jane Whitefield novels so far and this is the first one I found just a bit tedious. However, that said, Perry is still a better mystery writer than 90% of the authors of this genre. My feeling was the book went on a little too long. I like, and have always liked, the utter competence of Jane Whitefield. There doesn't seem to be much that fazes her or puts her off her stride. Not a bad book but the others in this series are just a little tighter and more suspenseful"
5,Great Series,Love Jane Whitefield! The books are fascinating and the twists and turns keep you hooked. Looking forward to reading the next in the series.
5,works great!,"I bought this for my Chicco London stroller and it works like a charm. Had to play around with the perfect location for the connectors -for Mommy's cupholder (or water bottle holder) and for baby's snack holder - but once I had it attached, we both couldn't be happier!I wish that they sold the snack holder separately - I keep forgetting to take it off, and after 2 years, it is showing signs of stress at the clip. Won't be long before it snaps, but it really gets bounced around in the back of the minivan, so I think it has held up great. Anything to keep my tot happy!"
2,stroller accessory,saw it and wanted to use it. kinda dissapointed it didn't fit my chicco stroller right. not worth the $$$$.
3,Just Okay,"This did fit my Chicco C5. Like other reviewers have mentioned it took a lot of patience and a lot of tinkering to get it on just right. I thought it was a little pricey for what you get. The S hooks look like they would snap if you hung anything on them. Plus, since it only comes with 2 attachment pieces you can't use more than 2 of the accessories at a time. I wish I could have found a set that was just a cup holder and snack tray. My stoller had an adult cup holder so all I really wanted was a cup holder and snack cup for my son. I was disappointed that there was no child sized cup holder. The only drink holder it had for the child was a bottle holder. I am using the adult cup holder low on the stoller for my son to set his cup in. Although it's a bit big, it works. The set I received was all black not green and purple as pictured which was a pleasant surprise. Since it works and there are really no other comperable products I am satisfied, but I do think this set could be better."
1,Awful cheesy garbage,"Couldn't imagine a worse record... then i got ""Piano, Strings and Bossa Nova. Both just horrible!"
2,Bossa Nova is Brazilian not Cuban Music,"Though the music of Brazil has been a great source of inspiration to many jazz musicians, results have not always been the best ones notably because the original character of Brazilian rhythms are misinterpreted as if it were a bunch of 'maraccas' or 'bongos', which are typical of Latin Music.Brazilian Music is not Latin Music. That's why this Schifrin's Bossa Nova experience does not hip."
5,Best Diaper Rash Cream,"As per title, best diaper rash cream in the market. I got it from a friend who has tried it herself for her baby. It smells good and lasts loooooong!"
3,A very good read,when I first went to get the book I was kind of skeptical. But When I started reading it I could not put it down. Go and get the book
2,GPS function is a bug-ridden disaster,"I bought this product so that I could use my laptop as my in-car navigator when I hook it up to my GPS. But every time it is all hooked up and working, it crashes my whole system after about 10 minuets. It does this every time, and I can not find any fixes on Microsoft.com. I am now going to purchase the Delorme Street Atlas and get rid of this waste of money. If you want this product for its GPS capability be advised that it probably will not work. Besides the lack of GPS function, the rest of the software seems to work well, although the locations of business are only approximate, and there is allot missing."
1,theGliberal,"Pocket Streets (PS) does not support route navigation, which is why I bought the software in the first place. The MS literature on Streets & Trips w/PS is very misleading as to what capabilities of S&T transfer to PS. Only maps (less than a certain size), points of interest and push pins can be transferred to the PDA. With a GPS, it'll show you where you are, but how do I get there?"
3,Microsoft Sterrts ansd Trips,"Not much better than 2001, too many errors,not up to date withNew ByPass."
2,Stay with the 2004 version,"Like in previous years a few more streets and points of interest from previous year, but nothing else new.One signifigant change is something that is a big negative - the driving times are now now based on ""Average"", ""Slower"", or ""Faster"" for different roads types rather than an actual speed. Since the program doesn't tell you how fast that is, who knows what the drivings times really mean. Guess they dumbed it down to people who can't read their speedometer."
2,What is missing does not balance what they added,"Although the GPS function is I guess useful if you like driving your car with a laptop on the seat next to you, Microsoft has updated some of the city streets but removed most of the previously mapped dirt roads and other features that made the 2004 version useful. If you used 2004 to find roads that may have been not paved surfaces don't get this program. I ended up installing it but keeping the 2004 version installed as well. Very disapointing move by Microsoft to take out much of the detail that made the program good."
4,Excellent software,"Great interface, accurate directions - everything you need in a software mapping program.I've never experienced problems with the software giving incorrect directions. I drive for my job - all over Michigan and out of state, this package is my #1 resource.The new GPS feature is nice - needs voice prompts but other than that great.Map detail is superb. Route calculation is quick.Printing maps and directions is easy and delivers perfectly.I can totally recommend this package."
4,Just what I wanted,"I bought the dumbbell set several years ago without the stand. Spotted this tray quite by accident and built my own stand out of plywood. Not shown in the image are 4 metal tabs bent down from the main sheet that are predrilled for screws. The main sheet is set at 15 degrees above the horizontal. The tray comes with 2 self-stick vinyl patches, visible in the image on left and right, that mostly just prevent clanking and paint scraping. They don't prevent sliding! Also included is a self-stick decal indicating the dumbbell weights in English and Metric with colors matching the weight increments. This is also visible in the center of the image."
4,works great!,"The Easy Bagger does a good job of holding a 55-gallon lawn bag upright & open. There are no moving parts, no wire stands, no bag clips to fuss with. If you can roll up a poster, you can use this item. My only complaint is that the plastic sheet loses some of its curl/spring as the plastic warms up in the sun. I simply reversed the roll occasionally & it functioned for 5 hours. Store rolled up & tied to maintain the curl."
5,lawn bagger works great,we have used the lawn bagger several times. It works better if you keep it stored in a cool area. but i'm very pleased with it.
4,Great heater!,"I only give it 4 stars because it is slightly louder than I had hoped for, but it heats better than I had hoped for! We have it in our boys' room, which is bigger than the recommended space for this heater, but the temperature difference is amazing! Finally, I'm not worried about them being cold at night!"
4,Quiet Warmth,This little wall-hugger is great for heating small spaces. It's quiet and heats fairly quickly. You can also use it as a fan; multi-seasonal! Great Design!
4,IT was ausum,I like Marvin Redpost why pick on me because in the middlMarvin`s teacher thought that Marvin pick his nose. gross!then Marvin asked all the people if they picked theirnoses too. I like it .It was a prity good book
3,Mid-price Wireless Headphones fill the Gap,"I asked for these headphones since my old wired headphones had literally fallen apart. I wanted a wireless set since I really like the wireless Sennheiser set I use at work but I didn't think the price for a Sennheiser would be worth it. I also wanted IR headphones because I didn't want another RF source to cause frequency interference with other electronics in the house. Plus, I usually use these right in front of my PC, so I can have the transmitter above my monitor and I don't have to worry about losing the signal if I leave the room.After several weeks of using the headhpones for listening to music or playing games on my PC, I think these headphones will work fine until I have the money to buy a Sony MDR-IF540RK ($62) or Pioneer SE-DIR800C ($250). The biggest gripe I have is comfort. These start to bother my ears after prolonged use, whereas my larger Sennheiser headphones cover the entire ear and are much more comfortable."
1,Don't waste your money,"Please, do not waste your money on this item. I purchased it and regret it miserably. When you're trying to use the headset it cuts out and only in certain positions are you able to hear your TV. I experienced a tremendous amount of static even while being only two feet away from the TV. The noise level is horrible too. Anyone who is in the room can clearly hear what I'm listening to regardless of the volume setting...so having this headset completely defeats the purpose. Save your money and invest in a better pair. Its not worth the aggravation."
3,Pretty OK,"Cons:*Well, when I got my headphones in the mail I was so excited I opened everything right away. And I was sort of dissapointed when I noticed that the range or distance wasn't long or far at ALL. I had the base on top of my computer stack and it still doesn't go far at all.*And another thing, my headphones won't charge. I don't know if it's that I'm not setting the headphones on the base charger right, but, I cannot get the headphones to charge. So I gave these headphones a 3/5.Pros:*They are lightweight.*They can use AAA batteries and not just re-chargable batteries.*They are really neat looking and sleek."
2,Disappointed,"After using it for a week, it started to have breaks in the sound on tv program from 3 seconds up to 20 seconds. Moving them head phones cause the sound to return, but not form long."
2,Not for Plasma TVs,"Not a bad set for the price, but they should put in bold letters ""NOT FOR PLASMA TVs"". The infra-red ""noise"" from the Plasma TV screen interferes with the IR signal to the headphones, creating a buzz. No way around it."
2,desappointed...,I didn't like...it does not play probably or does not play well.(is not what I was expecting).thank you
2,Wireless vs. Bluetooth,"Well the head phones are not bad at all, but the wireless system sucks, and the range is awful. If some person walks right passed you the signal is blocked for like 4-6seconds. So if you have more money get the Bluetooth version, it never goes out except if the battery dies."
3,Great Sound - Keep Dying on Me,"These headsets (when they worked) were really great. The over-the-ear style kept outside noise away and the overall quality of sound was very good. The problem? I have had 3 sets die on me...just go out and leave only a hiss in the ear. One set I was able to get replaced by Sony, but the last two are out of warranty. There is a chance that static electricity may have caused them to go out - not really sure, though. When I first bought them in 2010, they were under $39.00, not certain I want to pay $47 for something that will probably die on me again."
2,Doesn't work with plasma TVs,Nice product but it doesn't work with plasma TVs. The sound from the headphones experiences a large amount of interference from the TV. If you turn your TV off the interference goes away and the headphones work great. Turn the TV on and then the interference resumes rendering the headphones unusable. Wish Amazon would stated this BEFORE I bought them.
5,Headset working very well,I bought this headset for my Mother who is almost 90 years old. She had finally admitted that she could not understand what was being said on her TV.She is very happy now as she can actually hear and understand the audio by wearing this headset. It is very easy to set up and use.
2,Only clear from 5 ft,If you get beyond 5 ft it it very noisy.I tried with several devices with the same results. I would not reccomend unless your device is very close by. At 5 ft it was clear.
1,Sound quality problematic,"Purchased so that the TV volume could be low while providing me with adjustable volume when using the headphones. Comfortable and convenient, but when the volume was turned up enough to provide hearing clarity there was a constant background hiss. I didn't need 'concert hall' music quality but did expect reasonable clarity, which these headphones don't have. Ended up returning them."
5,Works great for hearing loss,I'm a 75 year old guy who has enough hearing loss that we had to have the volume on the tv and amplifier ( for dvd's)up loud and I still missed a lot of the dialogue particularly when viewing an English movie. So without subtitles I had a real problem which was very bad with Netflix. I had considered getting TV Ears but after reading so many negative comments about the short lived and expensive batterues and headphone cups decided against them. I was very leery about getting these Sony's because a number of people had complaints about a ringing that occured and other issues. I have experienced no problems since getting them. The clarity for dialogue has been great and they have made the watching and listening experience enjoyable again. I definitely recommend them for dialogue. I don't use them for listening to music so have no comment in relation to that. Overall I'm extremely happy I got them.
1,Nope. Sucks,"It's got a sweet spot of about 3 feet, left or right. Otherwise, static. Unacceptable. Yes, I use it, but it's a pain in the butt."
1,Poor product - Incredibly hissy...,"...even at 3 feet, and fades out at 6 feet. This is even after hours of charging. A disappointment, especially after reading the positive reviews here. This is on the MDR-IF240RK. Returning mine to Amazon.Update: I got the Sennheiser Rs120 headphones. At the time I'm writing this, they are only about $25 more and they are way better. (That is, I'm happy with them.)"
3,Plasma TV feed back!,"If you have a Plasma screen TV, don't buy this product.Granted I did not test this on other plasma screens other than my own, but I did get bad interference with the plasma screen on. If the plasma screen was not on it worked well."
5,Great ítem at unbeatable price.,It was a great item. The sound quality is great and very simple to set up and use. Would highly recommend.
1,Sony wirelss headphones,Lousy reception. I returned these. Woudl never buy them again. Went to Radioshack instead and those worked great
3,Infrared Wireless Headphones,The hiss and line of sight cut outs I expected but the constant static I did not. No wonder this product was discontinued. I would suggest if you are considering getting these to pay a bit extra for a BETTER PAIR.
2,Don't Bother.,"Very disappointed with these headphones. No matter how close or how far away from the tv there was a background noise, kinda like an interference that kept you from hearing the program. It's not the tv because this is a fairly new tv. I would not buy this product if I were you."
1,Too much static and interference,"I had to return the item, as nothing but static. I even unplugged the input source from the headphones, and even with no input source, the headphones were still full of static. If I moved the base unit, and held it a certain way, I could make it disappear, but as soon as I backed away, it came back. I have since bought a different brand, and it worked perfectly."
2,"Constant ""Hiss"" and Interference with Plasma TV","I typically do not provide product reviews unless the product is great or totally did not meet my expectations. I am sorry to say that this product was the latter -- I am returning it today. Other reviewers indicated that the product had a ""hiss"" when used. Mine also had a constant, undeniable hiss, which became worse as the volume increased. Furthermore, the interference was terrible. I tried putting the wireless transmitter in numerous positions and stood in various locations in our bedroom with the headphones, but I could not get rid of the interference, which, at times, was extremely loud and deafening. I read the technical information that came with the product, and it indicated that plasma electronics may interfere with the headphones' reception. I have a plasma TV, and I am assuming that was the cause of all problems experienced. I ended going to my local electronics store and purchasing corded headphones, which are working perfectly."
3,Good but not for use on a treadmill,The setup and use of this product was pretty straight forward. I wanted to use this on a home treadmill while watching TV. As soon as the treadmill motor went on all you hear is static. One call to Sony and they confirm that infared will get this type of interference from the motor. I returned to Amazon for a refund. Return process by Amazon was great. If you want to use wireless headphones for a treadmill you need to get RF not infared.
1,Terrible headset,The headset supposedly works at 24 feet away. We could not get it to work even 6 ft away from the base. Even with the 6ft distance there was a hissing noise. Im going to return this product
5,piece and quite,Now I can sleep while my husband watches Tv.My headphones got here in no time. You might have saved my marriage HaHa
1,Sucks for tv,"I bought the head phones so i can watch tv late at night, But they suck and i was mad that got them until i hooked my sony walkman. It works well with my walkman only when i set in my chair, If i get up the sound goes away. I thought sony made great products but this one i could do without, A waste of money. Sorry sony it is a bad product. I guess i will only use them when im tired and hook up my mp3 player and cant move around, Looking for something else."
2,"Initially Good, BUT ...","These worked perfectly for a little over 6 months, and then the right side just quit. The volume control still works, as does the On/Off switch, but no sound comes out. Not a long term investment."
3,Get a better product,I had a Sony wireless headset before but it was a better product then. This headset has a shorter range and is more cumbersome.
4,awesome product!,Thanks my husband can finally hear with the Sony MDR If240RD wireless headphones. The house has less noise as I can't hear the TV's Volume anymore.
2,Seriously?,"First off, without even having it attached to any tv, you can hear this wicked hiss when you put them on.Very distracting.I tried to get these to work with my flat screen (not plasma). It's about 3 years old. Plugged it into the correct location and nothing.Went to my 2nd flat screen (not plasma) which is about 1 month old. Worked right away.Not too sure why it works with one and not the other - but regardless - they stink and that hiss is enough to make you go crazy."
1,Review on wireless headphone system,"I have 2 such devices in my home, and this one does not perform nearly as well as the one I purchased several years ago from Radio Shack.It is very touchy - you have to be careful on how and where you sit when using it. Even turning your head causes fluctuations in the sound. Also the headset is not very comfortable. I was tempted to return it and still might."
2,Sony wireless headphones,"The reason for purchasing the headphones was to be used late at night in bed when one of us was sleeping. It is only used occassionally. There is a lot of static or hissing. You can still hear the programs, but would not be happy using the headphones on a regular basis"
3,Static with an exercise treadmill.,"This works all right with my exercise bike, but not with my Sears treadmill. I was going to return it but it looked like it was going to cost me $10 to do it. For $10 I can put up with static for watching TV on the treadmill. This is my 4th headphone set that I use while exercising, and the only one to give me this static."
2,Didn't last ...,"Don't want to be the spoiler if you are buying this but in months after buying and very carefully using these headphones, I got a loose connection in the headphone set and now one side is cut out. Its ironical because the reason I went wireless was to avoid this. Besides the range is very limited and I am not at all satisfied with Sony on this product. Its bad that they make use of their brand name to make such crappy products."
3,Ok for price,"I purchased this to make my treadmill less boring. Had to buy adapters to make it work with my cable system. When I finally got on the treadmill, the electrical interference made it unusable. Works fine off the treadmil."
3,It's fairly good,"In general, I am satisfied with it. The only thing is its range, whic is so limited, only 12 feet away and 6 feet wide."
2,Exected more from a name like SONY,"The concept if great but the sound is below average. The signal is lost the second you step into another room. It does have a cool charging system, but so do others. I spent over $40 on this and wouldn't do it again."
4,Sony Wireless Headphones,"Good product. Be careful about static electricity though, as I shorted out my first wireless headset when placing it back in the charging unit."
2,IR seems to have problems,"I returned these after one night of use. I hooked them up to my flat screen television and there was interference when the picture was bright. That is, when there was some sort of light colors dominating the screen, such as a daytime scene in a show or movie. When the screen was a dark scene or in-between scenes, the interference went away. This improved as I extended the cable away from the television towards where I was sitting, about 6 feet in front of the TV. However, if I am dragging the transmitter onto the coffee table every time that I use it, I am losing the benefit of a wireless system and I should simply buy wired headphones instead."
1,Good Purchase,"I recently purchased this item. Am satisfied with performance. I had some static when connected to front of my Sony TV. Move to back audio outputs and static went away. Placed on top of TV and get signal from anywhere in front of unit for about 20 ft. Also this way you can have low TV sound and adjust you volume @ headphone! Decent sound quality, a little break-up noted at high volume, way above a comfortable level for me. Rechargeable battery is nice, only use for an hour or 2 at night and hang up. As manual states Takes about 16 hrs to totally recharge and ready for the following evening. For a low cost unit am happy with Sony's bargain he remote headset Quality. Have had for 6 weeks without problem."
4,Good for the Price.,"These are a good product for the price. You will not be blown away with the sound but they get the job done. There is a hissing sound but you can minimize it by turning up the volume on the tv. Turn the volume on the tv up to maximum and lower the volume on the headphones rather than having the volume low on the tv and high on the headphones. You cannot completley eliminate the hissing sound but I would rather hear the hissing off the headphones than my wife complaining that she wants the tv off because she is trying to sleep. Headphones are comfortable, compact, and the charger is compact as well."
5,Great Headphones!,I have been using theses headphones for a few weks and love them! They are perfect for listening to TV while still keeping the volume very low. I am older and a little hard of hearing and according to my kids I have the TV pretty loud. These headphones are perfect for this and I can even hear the TV clearer. I don't know if they are enough for complex systems but for what I want they are perfect!
5,Absolute sound,We got these to allow us to catch the dialogue on the British DVDs we like to watch. We have found that they are also great with the TV to block out street noise here on the beach in Florida. It can some times be a bit of a party atmosphere around here. They work great. We can hear all the background noise of DVDs and shows. It is remarkable. I do find them a bit uncomfortable after a long period of use.
2,Unhappy,The headphones did not work. I sent them back to Sony and am still waiting to hear back from them.
5,Why don't you sell these anymore Amazon????,"These are great. Perfect for what I want to do, which is watch TV or videos on the computer without bothering anyone else. Range is just fine for my purposes. Some people complain about a hissing noise, but if you turn the volume down on the headphones and turn the sound up on your computer/TV, the hiss will go away. They cause or react to interference from cell phone and wireless, but never seem to be a big problem. Comfortable enough for long sessions. I came back to buy another pair but I see there's no new ones available =("
3,Good one....,Its nice for the price.... but I have more wires than before... :) also the range is bad and has static when battery is low...
1,Does not perform as advertised,"I bought this product, its supposed to work in the 24 feet range. Doesn't work at even 15 feet range, huge noise almost drowns the audio once you step outside 15 feet. The IR blaster is also too small, turn your head a bit and you lose it. Do NOT buy"
4,Out standing headphones,"I got this for my mom who lives with us and has her own TV she is hard of hearing so has to turn her sound up quite a lot. This is working out great for all of us, she can hear her TV and we can hear ours. Well worth the price."
2,Same problem as others :(,"When my headphones arrived they were in perfect working order, they worked great for the first week. After that they would increase in volume for literally a second followed my a audio ""pop"" then base would shutoff. This happens about every 5 min. Unplugging base made them work again for a short period but who wants to do that . I don't recommend these headphones at all."
5,a marriage saver,"My wife and I have different tastes in movies and television shows. With the Sony wireless headphone system, she can read (or use her laptop, or meditate, or work crossword puzzles)while I watch stuff she isn't interested in, yet we can be in the same room at the same time. Now we don't have to take turns, or spend time in separate rooms. We're closer.The headphones work exactly as described, and are entirely functional, as long as I stay in the same room as the TV. The headphones aren't the most comfortable in the world, but they're fine for couple of hours."
2,Broke after about a year or 2,The item broke about a year or 2. I did not use it a lot. Low price low quality. The name SONY does not mean great quality by default. In the market for another one. I wish had purchased a better one the first time.
3,peace and quiet,The reciver doesn't have much range and the head phones dont stay on your head very well they move up too easey
5,Sony Wireless Headphone System,Purchased three sets one for my daughter-in-law who watches tv without waking sleeping infant and for my husband and son-in-law to view television without disturbing others with loud volume. Excellent product so far. They are pleased. Late review due to being out of town and limited access to internet services.
3,Dissappointed,Lightweight so they need constant adjusting. Should have purchased a better brand. Can't keep them in the correct adjustment.
3,Ehhh...okay for the price,"I bought these for light use, watching tv from time to time. When I first set them up there was annoying static constantly but after increasing the input signal and turning down the volume on the headphones it cleared up. I wouldn't use these for prolonged listening though cause the static can cause your ears to hurt after awhile. When something blocks the line of sight you get static...so if the volume is up your ear gets blasted by static which is not pleasant.The headphones are a bit flimsy and the foam ear pads are cheap.They get the job done but I wouldn't use them for serious music listening. IR is old tech and can be problematic due to line of sight and the very short cord to the receiver makes placement a bit harder. I wonder if I can use an IR blaster or extender with this to make them work better?I will keep them since I only use them a little, if you're looking for a pair to use on a more regular basis I would highly recommend the RF or 900MHz type."
3,ALOT OF HISS =SpEND MORE GET MORE,"It was inexpensive and I use at work. I mainly want to hear something other than office sounds.I listen to talk radio and they work good for that pupose. There is alot of hissing in the background.They wouldn't be good if you wanted/need high quality, are no using directly in front of the sender or listen to music.If i had do overs i'd buy something a little nicer."
2,Not So Happy with the Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,Had this system for about a year. After the first 3 months it stopped charging the included battery. Had to use my own AAA battery to make it work. Luckily I used re-chargeable batteries. I could have have fought for the warranty but it would have been more trouble than it was worth. About 5 months after I received the Sony MDR-IF250RK the Foam Pad Ear Covers started to come off and they were extremely hard to put back on and they never stayed on for long. About 9 months into ownership the wireless head phone set the sound would sometimes crackle and I would loose the sound. I thought it may have been a loose battery. So I tightened the battery connection as much as possible but still got the crackling and sound loss. The crackling and sound loss always happened within range and direct site of the Bluetooth cradle. I guess I will now have to upgrade to a better model
3,good debut,"`Pepper's Hangout' was Johnson's first LP but it wasn't released until a few years ago. Aside from a couple of lame cover choices (The Things I Used to do"", ""High Heel Sneakers"") it is a pretty good album. The two slow blues (""Married Woman Blues"", ""Looking for My Baby"") are both vintage Johnson, while the instrumental title track is a simple but funky groove with awesome guitar playing. Though his other Delmark and Alligator albums are stronger, `Pepper's Hangout' is still essential for any Jimmy Johnson fan."
4,68 years later and still relevant,"As a life long movie buff I still remember the Alan Jocelyn role as he jitters his way through a spastic bit of behavior and comments that it was something the front office thought up to remind them of what awaits if Benny doesn't blow his trumpet and destroy the world. That concept of whether the world was too filled with evil was particularly relevant in 1945 as the terrible atrocities of WW 2 became apparent. The philosophical meaning was joined a short time later with James Stewart's It's a Wonderful life, where the absence of one good human being could change the course of History. Movies not only tell stories they also send messages and The Horn Blows at Midnight did just that. Patrick"
5,Sony ECM-T6 is GREAT for the price!,"Understandably, the other reviews express their disappointment in the fact that the mic does not come with a battery - so you'll be needing a CR-2032 battery along with purchasing this...NONETHELESS: The value is unbeatable. I used the mic extensively with Griffin's iTalk & my iPod to record motivational lectures, and the sound quality was significantly improved vs. not having used a mic with the iTalk. That said, this comes with a high recommendation, if you can deal with having to buy a battery once every couple of years. Sony definitely lives up to its reputation with this product."
4,"""Drastic Plastic"" - Still Vintage Be Bop Deluxe","The 1978 release, ""Drastic Plastic"", was the band's 5th and final studio album. Some critics and fans dismiss this work as weaker Be Bop Deluxe material. I say not so. Though not as artistically powerful and consistent as the classic ""Modern Music"" and the fine ""Sunburst Finish"", the band shines brightly on several tracks here. With Bill Nelson taking the band into a little bit harder, a more robotic style and even more sci-fi progressive feel in the music combined with very fine, witty and accomplished lyrical content, songs like ""Panic In the World"", ""Electical Language"", ""New Precision"", ""Superenigmatix"", ""Japan"", ""Possession"" and the fabulous ""Islands Of The Dead"" still give the band a thumbs up.Too bad it ended for Be Bop Deluxe after this album. Worth getting this on CD if you can get it!!!!!! Hopefully, somebody will reissue this ---soon please!!!"
4,Spendy but attractive and functional,"Seems a bit much for a napkin holder, but it works great and the kids get a big kick out of having a bird nest on our dinner table."
4,Neat!,"These are excellent glasses, short enough to fit in the top basket of my dishwasher, not so big that you risk either getting the guest drunk or (if half filled) making him think you're holding back on the wine. And they're sturdy.Oddly, they don't look at all like the illustration I'm currently seeing. They aren't goblet-shaped; they're on the thin side for a wine glass, which is perhaps why they're specified as White Wine Glasses.They arrived quickly and were wonderfully well packed, which is something I have come to expect from Amazon, but which is always a pleasure. I really have no need for THREE DOZEN, but just try to buy a smaller quantity! I left two dozen in the carton and put them in the attic, and content myself with thinking that I now have a lifetime supply."
3,good,Somewhat dry but a good theoretical review of the anthropological critiques leveled against the development industry in recent decades.
3,"Can't tell if it works or not, but my hair is already med-thick","* Nexus Diametress, well it looks like the original was better for volume and people loved it.* I thought this shampoo had a medicine scent, I think i would only recommend the leave-in conditioner only* The volume gel works fine, but did not like the waxy feel of the volume mousse* Hope they bring back the original or a Green product with no parabens"
4,Contemporary Counterculture,"Keeping Score is an interesting dichotomy-deeply personal, yet written in the uncommon, arm's-length, second person prose. It is a meditative tale of one man's spiritual and physical journey which unfolds in an earthy, Kerouac-like manner. This book has honesty, an appealing grittiness, and a beating heart."
3,"Good quality, not sure about the meanings...","I liked the quality of the cards, and the colors are very nice as well. For beginners it's a good deck because comes with the meanings, but I'm not so sure how much they really help after a few readings."
3,Eh...,This deck does not work for me. I never get a reading that makes any sense when I use it. I think the meanings that are on the cards are not right. They seem all wrong to me.However! I let a friend of mine use it and she got a fairly accurate reading with it.I think my energy just doesn't 'mesh' well with this deck so I am biased.Perhaps someone that used this deck exclusively when they were learning would have better luck.
1,very bad,"To put most simply... This is the worst movie I have ever seen. And I have seen a lot of them. Please read others for the reasons why. It is one of those that ended up being, well we have seen everything else but WWE section. Truly I tell you folks, this replaced Masters of Space and Time as worst movie I have ever seen. Do not waste time or money on this unless you are just the completionist and just have to watch everything."
1,Yuk!,"Maybe if you could sit through the first three mins. It my get better.Good luck, I couldn't do it."
3,IT'S A VIKING FILM LIKE NO OTHER,IT'S A VIKING EXPERIENCE YOU WILL ONLY FIND IN THIS FILM THE DIRECTION OF THE FILM IS ALSOME IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO WATCH I WILL ADVISE THIS ONE BUT I WILL WARN YOU IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE CERTAIN AUDIENCE MAY TURN AGAINST IT
1,Lots of things get severed many ways in this fantacy film,"The basic story is trying unsuccessfully to tell a tale of two Norsemen lost in North America in 1007. They encounter hostel Indians and seductive Indian women, the Blair Witch, and even a couple of runaway monks. We watch them make fire, eat fish and even a close up of one defecating in the woods.This film must have been made in 1007 as the producers have not figured out how to handle talkies. The voice overlay, what little there is is not in sync with the picture.Lots of nice colors and bird sounds. Looks mostly like ""Blue Planet"" however there are no animals eating animals unless you are counting the two Viking dudes that get ""left behind.""How to Shit in the Woods: An Environmentally Sound Approach to a Lost Art"
5,Excellent mount. Was pleasantly surprised.,This mount is great value. It is solid as a rock and shipped to my house in about a day. I couldn't believe how fast I received it. You will not be disappointed with this mount.
1,Disappointed,"Warning - portions of plot revealed!!! Unfortunately I purchased the book on the basis of other reviews. I was so disappointed that I spent even $4.99 for it. I really felt like she took the 1997 movie script and rewrote it with a happy ending. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes in frustration with this story. From the conversation about not enough life boats, to the fact that that the ""new money"" kindly mother just ""happened"" to purchase a gown for a spiteful neighbors daughter that was too small and how it would just fit our plucky, beautiful herione who could then join the haughty folks in the first class dining room with her head held high... She even jumped out of the lifeboat as it was decending to be with her love - I am surprised she didn't name the lovers Rose and Jack. I would not recommend this book at all."
3,Historical Fiction Read,"Fair read. My students are studying the Titanic on its 100th year anniversary, so this book caught my eye. It is worth adding to your library on your mobile device. It was interesting to look for the historical facts as I read. If you like love stories and the Titanic, you will enjoy the book."
2,Looks good but leaks,"I installed this tub set during a remodel. It looks very nice with a smooth nickel finish. My main complaint is that the tub stopper leaks unless you push it down really, really hard. Avoid this unit and get something that won't frustrate you."
3,Standard issue ipod earphones are better,"I bought these earphones because I thought I was upgrading from the standard issue ipod earphones to something a little better. Who can go wrong with Sony right? Well, I was wrong. In all honesty, I do like the fit of the Sony earphones better because they stay in my ear while I'm running (they come with 3 sizes of silicone rubber tips). The ipod earphones were just a little too big for my ears and I was constantly adjusting them. When I compared the sound of the 2 earphones, to my surprise the ipod earphones had a much clearer, crisper sound than the Sony and I could turn up the volume higher. I think I'll look into buying the Apple earphones with adjustable silicone rubber tips."
3,over-rated,5 stars for comfort - 2 stars for sound quality. Volume much lower than other earbuds. Sound is crisp but lacks richness on any equalizer setting. I almost returned them but the comfort factor changed my mind.
1,garbage,"If you like muddy bass and non-existent highs, get these phones.If you want good sound, look to Creative or Sennheiser or Shure.A waste of money."
3,Good Sound - Horrible cables,"I've had these for a few months and they immediately began to fall apart. I'm down to about 1/3 of the black covering over the speaker wire now and they have become un-useable (exposed speaker wire tangles quickly. I stuck with them because the sound is so great. But unless you only need these for a few months, buy something else."
5,Awesome headphones,"They fit my ears perfectly right out of the box. Very comfortable, sound quality is amazing. They almost completely block external noise. I did not experience any of the sound or volume issues mentioned in other reviews.My only complaint is that the carrying case is awful. I used the carrying case from a set of older and far cheaper sony headphones.I have only possessed these for 2 days so I have no idea about durability."
1,Disaster.,"These phones worked great for two months. Then, DISASTER. As with other reviewers, I started to find that the plastic/rubber casing around the earphone wires, particularly between the split and the buds, started coming apart in my hand. The consistency became sticky, and I can literally pull it apart with my fingers. I will NEVER purchase these earbuds again. Be warned. this is a common problem reported by a number of different users/reviewers."
2,Great sound but unreliable,"Same problem as a lot of others here, althought the wire did not fray, the right earbud stopped working in normal use. This is the third pair that I have had and each has only lasted 6 months, each has lost the sound in the right ear. This is the last pair I will buy.Unfortunately the sound is great, which is why I keep buying the damn things...Update Nov. 06. Finally gave up and shelled out for the Shure EC3 headphones. These are perfect after 1 year."
3,Decent...Depends on Person,"These headphones are O.K. In my personal opinion, they are good and bad. The good: they sit in your ear canal very well, even while working out. They also give you a nice reduction of outside noise. The bad: The sound isn't great. It's not bad...but not good either! I love Sony's products in general, but some of their headphones don't cut it. It really depends on the person, but these have a large emphasis on the bass, which is fine if you're listening to metal. However, for listening to some other types of music, one might notice that they lack in the treble and mid-ranges. I wouldn't pay the $40 retail price, but for $25 on Amazon, it's a decent deal! Overall, these are O.K. I personally like the Apple In-Ear headphones for myself which have great sound quality, but are more likely to fall out of your ear. For $25, you can't go wrong."
4,"would give five stars, except for the cord","An improvement over the pair I bought last year--which were great but not as bright sound as this new improvement. I prefer these for air travel since they block out all outside noise (just like ear plugs) and they are superlight, as opposed to the bulkier sound-cancelling headphones. I have these and the Sennheiser headphonesSennheiser PXC 250 Noise Canceling Headphones (Silver)-- I like both: The Sennheisers for listening to while at home or an an extended flight or the Sony's for the gym or short flights (traveling without any bulk)Sony has got to listen to customer that do not want this funky long cord (right ear) short cord (left ear) arrangement. This is so stylistically wrong. Oh well, that's my only complaint."
1,Awful sound quality,"These are very comfortable but they just sound awful. No bass or treble whatsoever. I have an Ipod and thought i needed some new headphones so i bought these, The ipod headphones sound 1000 times better but are not nearly as comfy."
2,Major flaw with these headphones...,"These headphones are great value. A great replacement for the stock iPod headphones. Great sound, comfortable to wear. However, the rubber ear cups are easily lost and they are ridiculously expensive to replace, and only the medium size is available as a replacement. Basically I lost one medium which is the only size that fits (note they must fit just right for optimum sound).So now I find out that Sony charges $13 CND for ONE replacement, and it has to be ordered from a the local distribution center, and the shipping with cost $15 CND. So in the end it's gonna cost me $30 CND JUST TO REPLACE ONE RUBBER EAR CUP! The headphones only cost $45 CND to begin with.This in just not acceptable and for this reason I cannot recomend these headphones. Too bad because otherwise I really liked them."
4,Not Bad At All,"The sound on these earbuds isn't bad at all for only $40. The bass is a bit muddy, but really does sound good with bass heavy music like rap. The mids on these are pretty average, they don't require an equalizer adjustment at all...just pretty flat, but not completely lifeess. The treble is pretty clar but it can get unclear if you play your music really loud. Not bad for $40 earbuds, but if you're looking for strictly on sound quality, you can do better."
3,"Good headphones, but not the earpads.....","I like this headphone, the sound is clear and rich. The only con is the earpads don't usually stay on very securely, They came off sometimes while I'm taking off the headphones. So after using it for 3 months, I've lost one and a half pairs of the replacement earpads. Now I'm down to the last pair, the largest one which I can't even stuff into my ears if I try. I don't think Sony sell the replacement earpads, so this headphone is now non-useable.....what a waste!I recommend super glue the earpads on the hearphone if you plan to buy it."
1,These are terrible...,"Sorry to have to submit such a negative review (really, I'm an Optimist) but I just received these and they are terrible. I couldn't package them up fast enough to return. I made sure that I inserted them all the way into my ear canal and the sound quality was so poor. Maybe I just received a defective pair (my package had a green dot sticker on it???) but I would avoid these. Good luck!"
2,"if you like to hear your music, these aren't for you","I really wish these sounded better, because their good points: extremely comfortable, lots of bass, blocking out exterior sound, are very nice, but ultimately, they just don't sound good. While the bass is much deeper than I thought possible, the overall sound is disappointing, appalling even, depending on what kind of music I'm listening to. The biggest problem is that the mid range is very muddy and indistinct, partly because that excessive and sloppy bass totally overwhelms the lower half of the spectrum. But even if the bass wasn't obscuring everything, the mid range wouldn't sound very good anyway. It's not clean or tight. Treble is all right. If you like to feel thumping bass in your head without wearing huge dj/recording engineer headphones, and/or listen to your music only on the subway or on planes, these might work for you, but if you want to hear all the elements and nuances of your music, definitely get something else."
2,Sound Quality problem,The earphones that came with the ipod nano had much better sound quality than the Sony. Returned it the same day I got it.
1,Skip these headphones,"I was amazed at the poor sound quality of these ""phones"", especially after reading favorable reviews from other customers. The major problem is that the treble, or high end of the tonal spectrum, is pushed way too far. The sound is very tinny to the point of discomfort. Music is harsh and the spoken word is over the top - sort of like the old days when listening to Dolby encoded tapes without the Dolby playback circuit turned on."
4,They sound great but are not built to last.,"These are simultaneously the best sounding and least durable headphones I have ever owned. The design of the silicone ear buds is brilliant--they make a little bit of power go a long way. The problem is that they seem to be designed to be disposable. In the three years I have owned them, I have had to replace the silicone buds twice now, because they get snagged and come off very easily. Also, the casing for the wire is extremely thin and flimsy. Mine developed numerous holes all up and down the cord. I don't even treat them that badly!I would still recommend these to anyone, but I would also recommend (carefully) supergluing the earbuds in place so you don't lose them, and wrapping the length of the cord in electrical tape. If this latter step will make them ""too ugly"" for you, be prepared to replace them once normal wear and tear rend them asunder."
3,"Nice earphones, could be better","I got these earbuds for my brother for Christmas. He has let me try them, so I am able to write this review through my personal experience.His opinion on them is that they are truly amazing. The sound blocking is great, and the bass is unbelievable.I felt that the sound isolation on these is really good, myself, even compared to my Sony EX-90LP's. The sound is nothing too great OVERALL, but the bass is what really makes these special. If you like bass, and want that stereo sounding bass (just without the feelings a subwoofer gives on your body), buy these; the bass is truly remarkable. I'm not saying the other sound isn't good, just it is only decent. Compared to the EX90LP's, the 90's really have amazing overall sound, and nice bass at high volumes, while these have a decent sound quality at all levels, with a nice bass, especially at higher volumes.I suggest these if you are on a budget, and if you really appreciate nice bass."
3,Great comfort but terrible sound,"Do not buy, get the Sharp MD33, about the same price but better. these fit comfortably, however, the sound is terrible. The highs are harsh, and actually hurt. Not only are they harsh, they are very tinny (tin), like hitting a 15 dollar hi-hat. I do not reccomend, only positive thing I got out of this purchase is the knowledge of Amazon. Simply the best online dealer in the world."
3,"great fit, not-so-great sound","I guess I'm in the minority here, because I was really disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. I read the other reviews and was prepared to do some adjusting - i.e., the better the fit the better the sound - but even with a good, tight seal, I just wasn't happy with what I was hearing. Too tinny, not enough distinction in sound layering.No complaints about comfort or fit, though, that was great. I was able to wear these headphones for hours with no pain or irritation and they didn't fall out like some of the regular earbuds tend to do. The noise canceling quality was pretty good, too.Last - and I know I'm being picky - the ""carrying case"" was a joke. Cheap little plastic thing, I'd have probably broken it within a week.Several people have recommended these for gym use, and as far as good fit and decent price, I'd probably agree. Just don't expect to be rockin' to great sound."
5,Great Sound and Price,"I've owned so many of these I've lost count for family members and gifts. They sound great and I can even participate in loud activities (lawn mowing) and still listen to them. Great sound, great range, great price (if under $20). What more can you ask for?"
2,"headphones sound so ""tinnie""","I returned them. The sound was so treble and ""tin-like""Very irritating. Instead I bought the Sennheizer MX51 for similar price....but a far SUPERIOR SOUND!! Wow! what a great difference.Infact I just bought another one... as a spare for next time."
3,"comfortable, sounds ok","I have had this for about 9 months now, don't impress me at all. Lets just talk about the sound of this earbud. As with all the earbud headphones, it only produce average sound. You can listen to musics with this but you can't never enjoy it. Bass is weak, mid is good, highs are too bright. Anyway, if you are someone how enjoys the pleasant sound of music, forget about this, go with a full size headphone. About the same price your can get a Sennheiser, it will make this earbud sound like crap."
2,Hear me not,"These earphones performance is pretty good, however they are so insulated that you can hear yourself breathe literally. So to me that's annoying, and as a result, I rarely use them."
3,ehh...,"I'm less that satisfied with them. If they weren't half price when I bought them I would have returned them.It took me quite a while to find the correct orientation in the ears. Completely non-obvious. If I redesigned them, the stem would make a ~130 degree angle with the bud so they could hang down. Then the low end is very dependent on how snug they are. If you tug the cord just a bit, they loosen a bit and the low end drops out. The cord feels cheap. I hate the asymmetric cord too.They're good enough to keep until they break, but I won't be buying them again, even at $20."
3,Good but could be better,"I give this 3-stars only b/c it fits in the ear better than others. However, it still falls out quite a bit. And the case they give you would be more useful if it were somehow attached b/c not only is it easily lost, but it's not so easy to place the buds into. Otherwise the the ear buds are exposed to dust. I lost one of the buds the first week of use."
2,Awful construction!,The sound on these is really good. It's just a shame that Sony absolutely found the WORST material they could find to make the cord. After 3 WHOLE WEEKS they were falling apart! The rubber/plastic on the cord is some of the shoddiest stuff I've seen on any consumer product.
1,Another one with cord problems.,I'm having the same cord problems as most other people. Sony support offered to sell me a refurb pair for something like $27. I'm not giving them any more business.
3,"Comfortable, but ear buds always popping off","I've been using these for about a year and a half now, and I've had to replace the buds at least 4 times, including yesterday when I found the bud had popped off again for no good reason and was nowhere to be found. As far as I know they do not sell replacements and I had to buy new ones a year ago when I ran out of buds! They seem cheaply made-the buds just kind of slide on giving you little confidence they'll actually stay on-but I guess you get what you pay for. I am personally afraid to spend alot of $$ on another kind and be disappointed since they are generally not returnable."
3,So far they rock my gym routine everyday,I have been using these for quite some time and no problems.The replaceable ear plugs are a good idea but sometimes they do come off. I had to replace the ones that fit my ear because I lost one of them and they come in a pair for a smaller size that also came with the hphones. 3 sizes come with the hphones.Also these are to be used exclusively with a music player that goes in your waist or arm because of the lenght on each side of the ear plugs. It is longer on one side. If you plan to use it for a threadmill or gym machine I dont recommend it. Your will not be comfortable and sometomes you will unplug yourself from the machine because of the size in lenght.So far that is the only downside.
3,There are better headphones out there,"I bought these hearing good reviews from many online retailers. I figured these must be really good with all the positive feedback I saw; However, now that I've had them for 3 months I have to say this is money better spent elsewhere.First off, the sound is muffled IMO, not to say these aren't loud. It's just that the sound could have been alot better for this price. I'm not particularly keen on the wrap around design of these. They always fall off when I have them put on. I have to wear them differently then they are meant to be just to prevent this from happening.One good thing is that these come with three different sets of earplugs so they will fit almost any ear. I also like that they are smaller than most other headphones.Personally, I suggest looking at the Sony MDR-E828LP headphones. Nopt only are they half the price of these, but the sound just seems clearer compared to these.You're just better off looking elsewhere."
2,Did not like the quality,"I purchased this product but returned it the same day. I did not like the sound or headphone quality. My other Sony headphone stopped working in one ear, and this one did not have the same high-quality sound. I love music, but don't like spending a lot on headphones. I have had many in the last few years, and expected Sony quality to be above far. This headphone's sound quality did not match up to my old one, so I returned it for another one for the same price but better quality."
4,Sony ear buds,Great product. Stays put in the ear even when exercising. Good base sound as opposed to other products of the same type.
4,best for the price,I have tried many headphones and for the price these are the best. Great sound. This is my second pair my girlfriend took my first pair. The only drawback is that the cords have different lengths for each ear which doesn't make for the best fit.
4,Good for the price,I've been using the headphones for little over a month now and it hasn't been giving me any problems. Bass isn't that great compared to the Skullcandy in-ear ones. But I'd pick these over the Skullcandy's any day.
5,Sony MDR-EX51LP,These are as good as the Bose In Ear Headphones at a third of the Price! I have found these louder and as clear as the Bose. I have both and I already regret blowing 100.00 dollars on the Bose first before I bought these. I can't understand the negative reviews of earlier. The only problem I see is that they will most likely lose an ear from a short in the wiring. I have come to the conclusion that all headphones will cut out in one ear at some point anyway.
1,"Comfortable fit, but terrible sound","I'll go in order of my experience: 3 different in-ear rubber thing sizes, one of which fit me perfectly. They are comfortable to wear and are very lightweight. Initially I tried the small earplugs and they were comfortable, but the sound was terrible. If you get no low-end with these that means you need to go a size up, even if you think they fit fine.I don't like these earphones because they sound very tinny. High range sounds are exaggerated even when I turn the highest band down all the way in my player's eq. It will definitely point out any low bitrate mp3s you have as the high hats and vocals try to do dental work on you.I'll keep them to go jogging with, simply because I didn't pay anything for them. Otherwise I would have returned them instantly."
1,early demise,"I received these the last week of October, and they died the first weekend of December. I used them with my IPOD. They are comfortable and work well for drowning out airplane noise while I listen to books or music during a flight. I am hoping I just got a bad pair and the replacement will last longer."
2,"Sound OK, Comfort OK - but won't last!!!","I actually use these headphones to listen to audio books, so the quality of sound is not as imperative. However, the comfort and durability are. I had one pair on which one of the ear buds stopped working after a month and now I am on my second pair and 1 1/2 months later, same story.For $ 40, I expect them to last a bit longer."
4,"I love the headphones, but they didn't last 2 months","I bought these headphones in anticipation of traveling overseas. They worked great out of the box, and did a very good of keeping the outside noises from getting in. Even worked great on the plane. I used them extensively for a month while traveling and did not have any problems. But now that I am back home the right bud doesn't work anymore. I really like how well the headphones work, but quiting after 2 months isn't that good. But I really did use probably 5 times more than normal. I debating whether to try them again. For around $20 I think I will."
3,Sony MRD EX-5,"I bought a mini Ipod for the gym and in a few weeks blew out the stock headphones....so I tried these. They sound MUCH better than stock, but the short cord kept causing one ear to pull out....plus the rubber material on the cord didn't help. So after a week I bought a pair of Shure E2C's to compare. The difference is night and day...and Sony's are history.I will say for the price they are great....but if you can spend the extra for Shure, they are worth every dime. They are a lot louder, and they have a lot better bass. I cannot understand why some people are having issues with them. The difference is night and day and Shure has a 2 year no questions asked warranty.I tried to go cheap, but it was a mistake IMO."
4,Great for the price.,"I like these headphones a lot. The extra length on the cable makes it easy to put my mp3 player in lot's of places other than my belt or back pocket. I use the right side ear insert for my morning/evening bicycle commute (45 minutes each way) and will say that I can hear the music without problem (much better than other models). I am sure that if I put the left insert in I wouldn't be able to hear traffic at all since the sound dampening feature of these speakers works so well. Of course, I won't be doing that anytime soon.However, like many of these type of headphones, the rubber gaskets that fit around the ear insert seem to fall off and get lost. I am down to four of the original six after just three weeks of ownership. I may be a clutz and lose them more often than others but that is my only complaint."
3,Just fair,"These headphones are extremely comfortable, but the sound is rather tinny. If you love treble, you'll love these. But, if you're looking for headphones with good bass response, look elsewhere."
3,Not so impressed,"The sound quality was fine - decent bass, crisp noise in general...nothing special but fine. Then they broke. Three months isn't like three days or anything, but still...they ought to last a year or so, I think, at least."
2,Great Sound but Poor Design,I have to agree with the other posts about the rubber ear pieces constantly falling off. I just lost one last night and now have to figure out if I want to order another set (second time now) or just get a different brand. The sound is great and the rubber ear piece blocks out noise fairly well but I have been so careful to no avail. I just can't see spending another $8 on the rubber pieces that I can only find on ebay.
2,not as advertised :(,"The description doesn't mention, and the picture hides the fact that these are not a continuous braid; they have a velcro-closure instead. I would never have ordered this had I known, and the restocking fee is quite high too. :-("
2,Less than I needed,"I was a bit dissappointed in this book because it was more of a comic book than an informative book. A lot of wasted space with big drawings and large print. I would have rather had more information and less cartoons. Many of the ideas mentioned I had already heard elsewhere. I guess it would be a good book for someone who knows nothing about humor and has no idea where to start, however we didn't think we got our money worth. My husband laughed at me for buying it. Does that count?"
2,Excellent,THe vocals are fantastic and bring me back to my teen years. The music is better then some of the oldies
2,Not worth the price,"Greetings! My kids and I decided to give this one a whirl for a science experiment. The container is tiny, even more so than the dimensions or pictures might convey. The ants were easily climbing up and clinging to the lid, making any type of clean-up or ventilation impossible without escapees. We ordered the ants and a third arrived dead; the remaining ants lasted less than 4 weeks before dying off. It was disappointing for my kids and I, since we were trying to record and document the progression of the ants at work."
5,"Ant ""Farm"" a hit with kids",I love this ant farm. My grandchildren love it. I also left the little booklet about ants that came with it lying next to it and even the reluctant readers read it. I love that they can see all the way through the glass and from all angles. The tiny magnifying glass is helpful too.A definite hit.
4,A gift,"This was a gift for my grandson, so I can't really review it. It looked really nice and facinating though!"
5,Dusk to Dawn Light,"I just installed this light and it is excellent for security lighting for a moderate sized area. Easy to install and quality made product. I had considered purchasing 2 more for other areas surrounding my residence but am reconsidering that idea now.In effect, about 2 months after installing the light I noticed the light was not automatically cutting off during daylight hours. Obviously the dusk to dawn photo cell has gone bad in a very short period. When checking my options on Amazon found the item was not returnable."
2,not so great,This smoothie blender was just OK. It was much bigger than I hoped and does not crush the ice well at all. Wish I had spent a little more and got a better blender.
5,Mirabai Holland Fabulous Forever Easy Strength,"Doing Mirabai's strength exercises at home is WAY better than going to the gym! This video combines educational information - so you'll know why you're doing this and how you'll benefit - with easy, helpful exercises. If you're not strong to begin with, don't worry. Mirabai lets you ease into it. The video is divided into categories, so if you just feel like doing a certain type - the upper body strength exercises are my favorite - that's OK, too. I LOVE this video!"
4,Massage chair reveiw,"This massage chair is a very nice product. I love how simple and quick it is to set up. Shipping was also very fast. The only drawback I had with this chair is there is no instructions with it. Even though it's easy to set up, it would be nice to know I did it correctly."
1,"Arrived broken, twice","Very pretty, but it arrived broken despite looking like it was packed well.Customer service was great, and immediately shipped a replacement.That appeared to be well packed, cushioning on three sides. BUT the bottom had no cushioning. Anyhow, you guessed it. The replacement also arrived broken.I certainly do not recommend buying this product."
1,there must be better baby face peek a boo books out there!?,"I was looking for a board book with faces of babies because I read that babies are very interested in looking at other babies faces and knowing that they also enjoy the game ""peek a boo"" I thought this might be a decent book. Very disappointed. How difficult is it to produce a quality book with such an easy concept?! All it had to contain was quality photographs and a couple different babies covering and then uncovering their faces. How did this book get published? It is not even the same baby (e.g. it asks ""where is baby?"" showing one baby and then the next page says ""here I am"" showing a different baby. Probably confusing to a baby/child. Got to be better books than this one out there. If I could have seen the inside of the book, I wouldn't have purchased it."
4,Great Headphones!,"These headphones work great they are very comfortable and sound quality on them is awesome! I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good solid pair of headphones. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit difficult to get on and stay on my ears, but this is probably due to the fact that I have long hair that does not like to cooperate. All-in-all these are great headphones and a good buy, just don't get frustrated if your hair is long and they're a bit difficult with it."
4,"some big dance anthems, but not as strong as the first.","Considering this is an Abel mix, there's a heavy emphasis on mixes and tracks by the Rosabel team, which isn't a bad thing, because they release some of the hottest vocal and tribal tracks around. The biggest bonus is a rosabel mix of Vicki Sue Robinson, clocking in at a lengthy 7:53. Rejoice by Michelle Weeks shouldn't have been on the playlist, considering it was included on Circuit Sessions 1 in a much better mix than this repetitive dub. Even so, this disc keeps that party feel, and is a good second installment of the series.1. Control (7:46)2. Rejoice (4:13)3. Women Beat Their Men (2:44)4. Energy Factor 9 (6:11)5. The Power (7:25)6. Move On (7:53)7. Don't you Want My Love (7:39)8. The Relief (4:56)9. Feeling it Too (6:54)10. In & Out of My Life (4:24)11. Lifetime to Love (6:49)"
4,Pleased,This is classic Joe Hinton. I enjoy listening when sitting back with a glass of merlot waiting for the last vestiges of daylight to fade away.
5,This watch delivered as promised,"Absolutely love this. I was looking for a simpler watch with fewer dials that I'd never use, but robust enough to stand up to scuba diving and other outdoor sports. Plus, I wanted somethign that looked good with a suit for the office.This is a great product - packaging was unique, watch doesn't feel heavy to wear, the watch hands and hour markers actually glow in the dark and keep their charge because of their component. Great great product."
5,A Gripping Police Procedural -- Must Read!,"""Fortune Cookie"" Karma by Louise Crawford is the best police procedural I've read this year. The detective team of Murry and Kidman are a refreshing change from the grungy, psychologically damaged detectives that populate the genre. This book has a serial killer, but he is intriguingly different from the usual lot. The plotting is seamless, the writing crisp, and the pace keeps the pages turning. It's impossible to put down once started. An immensely enjoyable mystery. I highly recommend it.Wolf Wootan, author of ""Edge of Tomorrow"""
4,TV Slide Out Mount,"I purchased this mount for my 5th wheel. We replaced the old TV with a new flat screen. The TV sits in an enclosed opening that has thin sides and back. The bottom shelve was the only sturdy side in the opening. This slide out mount works great because it is anchored on the solid bottom. The TV is attached with a regular back mount. The slide out allows us to have the TV forward while watching and then slid back into the opening when we travel. It allows the TV to rotate in the opening for ease in making the connections to the back of the TV. There was no stop on the swivel post to keep it from turning while we are traveling, so I had to make a couple of stops for each side of the TV to keep it from swiveling. These have to be removed to slide the unit forward for watching TV. Other than not having a swivel stop, I am completely satisfied with the mount. It was easy to install. The install instructions could have been better, but I got by ok."
5,Excellent Kids/Whole Family Movie!,"It's still heartwarming to know that an excellent movie for the whole family can be made with a believeable storyline, wonderfully solid acting and charcters with a truly positve, inspiring message for kids. Congratulatons to Dreamworks for taking the chance on a movie that did not rely on the need for any violence, inappropriate language and negaitive character development. My kids, ages 8, 6 and 3, were a little skeptical, as was my wife, given the PG rating, but they quickly became very engaged in the movieline and are now wishing to see it again as are mom and dad! So much so we are going to pruchase it as one of ur classics. We reccomend it for all families that would still like to think that excellent movies can be made with wonderful casts that we can proud of! Way to go Dreamworks! Keep it up!David ~ Massachusetts"
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could.,"The perfect movie, with the perfect cast, perfect direction, perfect music, perfect cinematgraphy. Everytime I watch this movie it just gets better. For me personally, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
5,Say 'Yes' to buying this.,"For those of us who never deserted the horse-love stage of our lives, this movie is a must. For children who are still in that stage of growing, another must. For MEN, yes, even the ones who run from any movie which may be mildly scented as a chick-flix, you really need to see this movie. Do it in mixed company or alone but do it. More than one male aquaintance has borrowed this DVD to show to someone else. It is not suprising how every one of them commented positively about the content.It is much more than a horse story. The fences mended here father-son relationships, father-child, husband-wife, rational brain & compassionate soul.Kurt Russell & Kris Kristofferson are the best in the son/father roles."
4,the chickadees like this feeder,"The chickadees found this feeder within a day.Updated 11/2008: Finches like it too, but prefer to graze on the seconds deposited below the feeder. The perches seem comfortable for the small birds. Sometimes 3 or 4 birds dine at once, but mostly they take turns on it.The discarded hulls of the black sunflower seeds made a mess on my patio. So, I hung a 2' diameter planter under it to catch the discards. I don't have a squirrel problem, so this has been fine. After just a few weeks, the planter is full of sunflower sprouts. Chickadees also discard a lot of whole seeds. (The ones they cannot crack easily?) The finches sit on the planter and pick them out. The finches also sit in the planter and graze the discards, so hanging a simple platform feeder underneath would be another solution for patios."
3,"Shoddy utensils, but decent value","All of our utensils have broken (they are not welded very well), but the pots and strainer are all still in good shape. They are very small, though, so be prepared for that. They hold my kids attention well enough, despite their limitations. Overall decent value, however, I would probably buy a higher quality set next time."
3,Smaller than you think,"I was disappointed with the size of this toy set. The biggest ""pot"" is about the diameter of a tea cup. I was hoping for something a little more ""life like"". But, I haven't been able to find anything better."
2,Broke apart after a month of use,I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter for Christmas and the utensils broke apart at the handle which my child could have choked but she brought it to me. The pots are ok but the pan handles also broke off. I would not reccommend this toy at all.
1,Zero stars,This product simply does not work. I've tried to run it on three different computers with only frustration as a result. All the other reviewers are absolutely right! Don't buy it.
1,Wouldn't recommend,Doesn't work with an external USB cd writer. Reboots upon entering the program. This occurs with Win 98 and XP.No support from DataBecker. Therefore I wouldn't recommend any of their products.
1,Problems with Win98,This product does not work well in some functions with Windows 98. Import Song and Speech recording do not launch. Instead a runtime error occurs. The program crashes often in wave editor. Tech support is not helpful. They recommend patches that do not work and then ignore any further email on the subject. It is a very frustrating program to work with.
5,Another gem,"I have to tell you that I received Faked to Death in the post late in the afternoon on a Thursday; by Friday morning I was reading the final words - and I loved every minute of it. Posted to Death was a great surprise and a thoroughly enjoyable read, and its sequel was even more enjoyable. I really want Simon Kirby-Jones to have that conversation with Giles. I won't divulge the details or the plot - just read it and enjoy!!"
3,Looks Well Made But NO TANKS!,"I ordered this set after seeing the graphic appeared to offer a complete set including the cylinders. However, when it arrived, the cylinders were missing.After communicating with the seller a few times via e-mail, they agreed to take it back and give me a full refund.So while I never actually used this equipment, it did look very well made and would have been a good deal if the cylinders had been included.The seller has since added a note to say the ""tanks are not included"""
1,Didn't work w/Motorola phone,Product didn't work with Motorola phone. I contacted vendor twice and no reply. I will never buy from them again! Go to a store and buy one so you can test it right on the spot.
2,"Great idea, poor quality welding.","I only write a review for one out of 100 things I buy, so this is worth listening to. I paid too much for this to begin with, after tirelessly searching for a US made stainless steel roasting rack. I failed, so I went with the overpriced european version. For one year, and 7 birds, it worked great. Bird #8, a 13 lb heratige turkey, broke the end off of one side. I very poor resistance weld that holds the leg / handle wire to the grate. Bummer, I thought I had bought my last of something. Sad thing is that I am a union metal fabricator / engineer, and can't find much that is made these days that is domestic and / or isn't junk. They got this item 90% of the way to a great product. Looks like I will be stuck finishing (for myself) the last 10% that I payed for. Almost had a 5 star, if it had just lasted."
2,"Good quality, but pricey",I actually ordered this by mistake. It's a good oven rack but way too pricey. (I paid $65)
2,Too Much Ecstasy,"Jimmy Somerville's Root Beer EP consists of thumping disco mixes of heretofore tight little songs from his excellent Manage the Damage CD (and a few other import only tunes). Recommended for the perfect headache - not the one you'want to get rid of, but the one you're trying to bring on. For those on E or lost in a K-hole."
1,A- palling,"Todd, you are so onto it. This book is an utter waste of cash. Even the new info is highly doubtful. Best to ignore tham completely methinks... And if you've bought it- get a refund!"
1,Terrible Book,"I have read this book on the internate. There are alot of mistakes. First of all, in one page it told about brownouts(like microwave beam torhing other buildings). I have never seen this happen. It also said that rioters ae suppose to set fires, I have never seen this happen. The prices to all these buildings are wrong. The cost for a Coal Plant is 4,500 doolars is suppose to be 5,000 dollars. It says that when there is a nuclearmelt down, fires are set. This is true in SimCity 2000 but not in SC3K. And there many other mistakes. Throw this book out."
4,Does the Job,"Works like you'd want it to. I have an old favorite PS2 keyboard that I moved to go with a new desktop PC that had only USB inputs. Only one minor incident when getting the keyboard installed, in that the keyboard installed upon being plugged in just fine, but upon the first reboot, the PC didn't recognize the keyboard. After a second reboot, the keyboard was seen by the PC, and haven't had any problem since (it's been a couple months now). I'd blame the PC/Windows OS, not the cable for that glitch."
1,Smells terrible,I love powder scented sprays for my dogs - but this one doesn't smell soft and powdery; it's overpowering and soapy.
2,Very strong baby powder scent,This spray has a long lasting strong baby powder scent. I do like the smell of baby powder but I found this spray to be too overwhelming. I had to give my pup a bath to be rid of the smell.
5,This Book Changes Businesses,This is a geat book with a lot of ideas to help businesss run better. At my company we read this book as a team and put the principles into practice and the results have been very noticable. The most valuable lessons from this book were the communication tools. The meeting formats and the daily huddle philosophy has helped our company tremendously. Communication at our company has never been better. I highly recommend this book.www.linkedin.com/in/benparamore
4,22re Auto trans,This is the right item for my 93 Toyota pickup wuth 22RE and auto trans. The gasket is different from the stock gasket in that it doesnt have the grove built in to hold it in place on the pan. I used grey RTV to hold it in place anyway. The screen and screen gasket are same as stock. Make sure you get all the old gasket material off and dont over torque the bolts
3,Nice but sizing is off.,they are nice pants but the sizing is off. they said a large was a 30.532 but they come as a 35.
4,Easy to Clean,"They attract dust and dirt, but they are easy to clean. The fit is ok too. The price was fair."
3,"As a mystery, so-so, as a gay affirmative novel, very good","The value of the book as a mystery is pretty average. However, I found, as usual, the portrayal of gay characters very affirming and supportive. Especially good for gay teens or people just coming out."
2,Sight Unseen,Glad I read the reviews and learned that an answer key could berequested from the publisher. Considering the [cost of the book]...this should be included! I agree with others..what good areexercises if you've no way to check how right/wrong one's answers are?
1,NOT No No Nanette,"We bought this video as research for the musical. This is nothing like the musical. A few badly sung songs from the musical have been tossed in or are used in the background. There is a horrible dancing dream sequence. Bad movie, not worth buying. No wonder that it is hard to find."
1,Stranger Than Fiction = Bad Religion,Isn't Stranger Than Fiction the name of a Bad Religion album? I think I'll stick with that one.
4,A popular treatment of Jesus' discipleship sayings.,"Building on the work of William MacDonald, (True Discipleship, Kettrick Press, 1961), the author illuminates the meaning of Jesus' seven ""discipleship sayings"" with a liberal selection of cogent personal anecdotes. This volume, which omits the substantive exegetical work for which the author is known, was clearly edited for the layman. This lucid volume will help unlock Jesus' command to ""go and make disciples."" There is one unfortunate shortcoming. Although each chapter includes questions intended to help the reader interact with the material, more help answering the ""So what?"" question would have been helpful."
4,Neo Soul and Acid Jazz a good combination,"I really enjoy listening to Acid jazz especially if its funk driven and not to heavy into fusion, this disc is a quality mixture of funk, jazz, and soul. The artists concept behind each song is not to complicated just plain old feel good music,if you want to hear some serious laid neo soul/acid jazz check out Hidden Beach volumes 2 thru 4 which I got at a good price here on Amazon."
5,Got Cheated,"This isn't 16oz, it's only 10oz! I was cheated out of 6 ounces, and you will be too.This works fine but you need to ventilate the area as if you were painting."
1,"Terrible, terrible","The 2008 National Mathematics Advisory Panel Final Report says clearly that cognitive science is not yet at a place where it can inform curriculum adoptions.This book (and its successor ""How Students Learn Mathematics in the Classroom"") is poor support for the deeply flawed methodologies that have created an entire generation of mathematically illiterate students in America."
1,Never again!,"This is typical Sony. I have heard that it works great with a Sony Mini-Disc recorder... if you have one, maybe it's not so bad. For any other application, avoid this thing like the plague!The microphone is designed to clip to a lapel or stand on a table. It's fine for the lapel: the mic will capture the speaker's voice and not much else. For standing on a table, it is absolutely useless. The speaker's voice must be within 6 inches to pick up anything. It's also very poor for a uni-directional microphone, it's more omni-directional in practice. Not what I expected from what Sony brands a ""uni-directional"" microphone.This is the last time Sony robs me. I will never again buy another Sony-branded proprietary piece of junk. Never again!"
3,Ok product,The sound quality sucks on this headset. It's definitely nto worth the price. I would just get a Plantronics for the same or a lower price with better quality. The mic is so-so.
3,Didnt expect Sony Headset to break soon,"Hi, i specifically Opted for Sony because of the brand and the reason i didnt even go for 1year replacement warranty, but hardly using for few times (or) in a month, the mic is not working properly and I cant do voice chat on messengers. Didnt expect Sony brands to break so soon. Needs a badly look into the products and durability.Thanks!"
3,"Memorable coming-of-age story, but incomplete","I would actually give this book somewhere between three stars and four stars.Poetry is an amazing thing, and my favorite place to find poetry is locked in with prose. This book consists of almost nothing but prose/poetry, and I think that is a good thing. The words are captivating. At the same time, I thought that some of the ""poetry"" did not have enough meaning, and in some places it made me think that the author had tried to hard, unecessarily, to make poetry instead of telling the story. Overall, I wanted more. Despite all the difficult events that Mariah, the protagonist, suffered through, I finished the book understanding only that Mariah had had a hard life, and still not knowing Mariah very much at all. The metaphors and the colorful images painted by the poetic lines were often interesting, but sometimes hard to accept coming from someone of Mariah's age without any childlike ways, habits, or vulnerabilities to temper them."
4,"Good, first hand history","This small book is an easy, engaging read about an often overlooked chapter of WWII. It offers a broad outline of the conlict, and does an adequate job of outlining its causes and the major players involved. Where it really shines, however, is in its use of first hand anecdotes to move the narrative along. Some of the most powerful commentary on war and combat I have ever encountered can be found in these pages.I would reccommend following up this book with Trotter's ""A Frozen Hell"", as it offers a signigicantly more thorough investigation of the causes and politcal aspects of the war. Still, ""The Winter War"" is is an enjoyable, informative work."
1,good model,"I was happy with the price, but I was suppose to leave a feedback a while ago. I totally forgot to. The bx-10 is one of the best models, but when I got mine it was damaged in all ways. Doesn't even look like yhe pictures to top it off. I'm not going to explain what else is wrong with it or else this won't be posted :-/"
3,The writing is wonderful but the characters are annoying!,"Lois Lowry is one of the best writers for children around, but I find Sam to be one of the most annoying characters around. He is simply too precocious to be at all believable, as was his sister Anastasia before him! In fact, all the neighbors are really too clever, interesting, well educated and understanding to ring too true to me. Maybe there really is a neighborhood like Sam's someplace, but I doubt it. That said, I always read each new Lowry book and do find myself enjoying them, and I'm sure most readers would too."
2,Not Quiet Happy,"I used this book for my freshman english class and am sorry to say that I mostly didn't like it--the book is supposed to give professional examples of different writing patterns, so that the students can imporve their writing, but that's the last thing it does! The only helpful thing were the student sample, although, on the contrary to the complicated, professional essays, they are really easy and you won't learn anything from them either. Overall and simply-worded, the book won't help you that much!"
3,"Easy to use, hard to set up","Got this to supplement a complicated, tiny button remote that came with an HD TV for my aging parents. It works well but takes some time and extra effort to set up. There is no LED to show when setup buttons are pressed correctly. It didn't have the Samsung HD TV code in it's tables, so it took about 50 iterations of the search sequence to find the right code. After that, it works great."
2,Not as shown,"The remote is black, not silver as shown. This is very difficult for someone with macular to see and can easily get mixed up with the telephone."
3,Not what I thought,I thought it would be bigger. I will still use it. Quality is just okay!! The sound is not the quality I thought it would be either. I guess I expected too much.
2,Much Smaller and Than I Expected,"I was under the mistaken impression that the indicated length of the product (17"") was perhaps the longest of the chimes in the set. But, I was sadly mistaken about that, and actually took out the ruler to find that the length of the item is from the tippy top of the string (yes, the string) to the bottom of the square wind catcher. I think that this seller should have a better and more complete description of the product on the site. If I had known that it was so small, I would not have ordered it. I clearly expected way too much for the price of the item, and will have to look elsewhere to find what I really want. I am planning to keep it, only because I have no other wind chimes right now, and wanted to have something. I guess it'll be a starter one for now until I find something I like a lot more."
2,Squeaky and dropouts,"I normally don't pay much attention to negative reviews, but I wish I had on this one. On my laptop folks I speak to complain of dropouts, and I hear an awful squeeling sound when speaking at times. I can't figure out what is causing it (angle / tension etc) and so am returning this."
4,Good CD of German music.,"This CD, ""Alles Nur ein Spiel"" (All Only One Play), does not strike me as her best German album. However, I love the type of music on this CD. Thus, I approach a review of this CD with mixed emotions. I like the music very much, but I do not think others will share my opinion. On to the details. There are twelve songs on this CD, and not as much variety as in most Mireille Mathieu CDs, as this is almost entirely love songs with similar music types. Despite this criticism, the music greatly appeals to me personally. I particularly liked: ""Wie soll ich leben ohne dich"" (As I am to Live Without You); ""Paris""; ""Das echo der verlorenen zeit"" (The Echo of a Lost Time); ""Immer frei sein"" (Always Freely Given); ""Niemal ohne dich"" (Never without You); and, ""Liebe stirbt nie"" (Love Never Dies). A good, but not great, Mireille Mathieu German CD, but right down my alley."
4,awsome,"This is a great movie , if you are a k-9 lover then this is the movie for you. You step in side the world of a police dog trainer ,just before they hit the streets"
4,The haunting feeling remains,"Set up for a conspiracy, on the run for many years- what a life. I admire the work done by the activists of the seventies, but would not want to live the life forced on Vida. How can someone run for so long and remain so disconnected from people, as she had to be? She did the work that she did because of her love and concern for others so it was even harder to take that she wasn't ""allowed"" personal involvement. Her work in the ""movement"" continued, but I was left with a feeling of discontent by her life. I don't remember the details, as I read the book several years ago, but I do remember the feeling that I had when Vida had to walk away from it all, again."
4,The return of a classic,"Finaly we have this film out on DVD!From TOHO Studios(the people that brought you Godzilla and his friends)comes a very different film with a different""feel""than their regular titles.For a TOHO film,it's dark,gloomy,and suspencefull.But don't get me wrong,the same old campy monsters are still in this one(only not in GIANT size!).The acting is a bit better than their other films and over all better written.As a classic ""B"" movie of the sixties Japanese classic era this film stands out.Just remember not to eat those mushrooms!!"
1,bad thing,I order it at Jan 2007 and wait for about 2 weeks. But I got nothing and have to cancel it. It is really bad service.
5,SMALL BUT MIGHTY,"TV WORKS GREAT, AT TIMES RECEPTION CAN GET FUZZY, BUT IT SIMPLY TAKES A MINOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE ANTENNA TO RECEIVE."
4,A great value,We are very pleased with this TV. It works well in the small room where we wished to view it. We use the antenna and received very good reception.
4,Good for the job!,I USE THIS TV TO AIM SATELLITE EQUIPMENT. A GOOD SIZE TO SEE THE SIGNAL METER USING A VIDEO SENDER. WORKS GOOD IN ALL WEATHER AND A HANDY SIZE WHEN ON A LADDER. GOOD SOUND FOR SMALL SPEAKERS
4,Next size please,"Great little t.v for my use. I only get 2 channels where I use it, 1 comes in almost perfect. Needs a little better antenna maybe. Also needs a better stand & instructions that are understandable, you learn on your own. Would I recomend it to others, YES. Got a 7 inch?. Great price too. Fast, on time shipping. Thanks"
2,NO UHF or VHF switch,I bought this and it did not have a UHF or VHF switch. I amnow looking for something with a UHF VHF switch.
2,Poor Reception!,"I bought this TV for my Dad. He wanted to replace a small screen handheld Casio that was stolen. The Coby had a great picture when hooked up to cable. However, he wanted the TV for watching while taking his wife to the Doctor's, which is often. He will sit in the car and watch TV. He couldn't get any channels on the antenna. No good! I got him a 4"" Casio, which he likes so much. I decided to get one myself and it's fantastic! A definite 5 star. However, Casio is getting out of the TV business, so you will have to buy a refurbished one if you want the 4"" inch size."
1,Junk,"What a cheap, crappy little TV set. I couldn't even keep the power cord attached. Waste of money. Couldn't wait to ship it back."
4,Kitchen TV,"What a marvelous little TV. A little tricky to figure out at first, but stick to it. Battery must be aligned perfectly for the remote to work. Tends to be a little darker picture than I would like. Brightness doesn't really do the job tho it helps. Very nice picture on 7-8 channels off the built in antenna. Get my local stations, plus others. Just what I needed for my kitchen (I spend a lot of time there). Have been so happy with this purchase, to date. We will see how it is in the future. Glad I bought it."
2,"Coby TF-TV505 5"" LCD Color TV","At first I thought this was the greatest little TV. I was impressed. Easy to set up, worked great the first two months. Then it just started to loose reception the pictures got fuzzy and I no longer enjoy it. I found it would cost more to ship back and have repaired than to buy a new one (definately a different brand). I would not recommend this TV to any one. To be fair there is always a lemon in the bunch and maybe I got it so you won't. So good luck on making your decision."
4,Beautiful Form and Flawless Function,"I had been using an rubber mallet I got at a home improvement store. It was cheap ($4) and functional. The problem was cleaning it and food safety. I decided to upgrade to this meat pounder. I am happy I did. The metal coating and the heft of the cast iron make this a perfect tool to make a paillard, a scalopini, or a perfectly fried chicken breast/thigh for chicken parmigiana. I highly recommend it."
5,"Best 50"" under $2000","I've owned this Vizio 50"" Since February 07. I compared this to Sony, Samsung, Panasonic and Toshiba models, and the picture was as good or better than all but the very expensive 1080P models. My only question regarding some of the poor reviews is whether Vizio uses consistent components over time. This model has Faroujda video processors, NOT something you find in low-end equipment. I have had no problems, and at $1500, it's is a major steal! The shutting off problem I've read about is disturbing, but so far I've not had it. One possibility is that such a low price opens up a high-end, sophisticated piece of equipment to folks that might not use whole lot of common sense when installing, using and caring for the unit. I called customer service just to see how the reponse was, and after holding for about 45 seconds was greeted by a courteous and professional customer service rep. Great buy all the way around so far."
5,Great little budget Joe Walsh package of his ABC Dunhill stuff!!!,"While these budget packages are usually hit or miss,this one hit's the bullseye!!! Lots of great Joe Walsh tunes from his ABC Dunhill era are here,Rocky Mountain Way,Meadows,County Fair,Time Out,Days Gone By(with great flute and vocals by the very underated drummer Joe Vitale),Turn to Stone and more!!! Great sound too!!! It rocks!!! 10 great tracks in all!!! Had it on audio cassette and now got it on a awesome sounding CD!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way Up!!! A+"
3,Oldie but Goodie,"I use this book on occasion to explain a telephony word in simple terms. The only drawback is that the book was last revised in 1986, only two years after the breakup of the Bell System. Basic principles and terminology are well defined, but missing are the definition of the buzz words we live by in todays intense competitive telecommunications industry. Acronyms such as ILEC, CLEC, NEBS and concepts like virtual and physical co-location are not in this book. Nor is ADSL, SDSL, IDSL, VDSL, VoIP, etc., etc."
4,East meets West,"I heard of this for a while (since I got the blues) And was exited to finally hear it. This is a good album if you like Hooker (I do) but if you want to hear some Hogs like Hooker n' Heat showcased Canned Heat (Al Wilson)on the second disc you get nothing. If it wasnt called Hooker & Hogs you would never know Tony Mcphee is there. The sound quality is o.k. (what do you expect I guess) the last Bonus songs sound horrible, but the album is good blues otherwise. Little Dreamer is my highlight for this disc. Even though I like The Groundhogs more than Canned Heat if you dont have Hooker n' Heat or Hooker & Hogs you should get the Heat first, (better sound,chemistry & more songs) but if you have the Heat you should enjoy this."
5,Blomus Round Mirror,"This product arrived fast, was easy to put on the wall and looks clean and crisp. It looks cool"
2,Ultimately disappointed,"At first glance, it appeared this measuring tape might be a triumph of design; a masterpiece of function. But substandard construction quality has left me unsatisfied. The bolt holding the two halves together was very loose, almost allowing the device to fall in two (which could have been very inconvenient, considering there's a spring under tension inside). Tightening the bolt was tricky, as it requires a hex wrench, not a screwdriver. In addition, the tab at the end of the tape is very loose, which could affect measurements by and eighth or a sixteenth of an inch. A measuring tape that's not completely accurate? How about applying some ""function over form"" here?"
3,Meh...,"I got my son a bunch of animal books for his 3rd birthday. Two were from this series (the whales and the tigers), and these two were easily the worst of the books I got him. I would probably rank this whales one slightly below the tigers book, but both suffer from too many photos that look similar to one another and poor image quality because the photos aren't printed on glossy photo paper but rather regular paper, so the images are dull. I wouldn't recommend getting this one."
1,HP Customer service hassle,"My printer would not accept one of my ink cartridges. HP support sent me to India for ""tech support"" which wanted to charge me $39.95 to speak to representative. I told them my printer was fine I just needed to replace a faulty cartridge and refused to pay them a fee to return an item. After an hour and 6 representatives later, I ran out of time. The cost of replacing the cartridge is $65 but my sanity is priceless."
4,Just what I Ordered.,It came quickly. It strong and durable. Blends in anywhere. Only problem was that shipping was almost as much as the product itself.
2,pool toy,"Was a bit disapointed in both quality and ""funability"". Just wasn't what we were expecting and my group just were not interested in it in the least. Of course, that doesn't mean someone else would not like it...it just didn't ""fly"" here."
2,disappointing quality,"the sheet set arrived looking BEAUTIFUL.. very nice packaging and when opened, the sheets felt luxurious and soft. however, after one washing, I thought I had washed a paper towel with the sheets, there was white debris everywhere, the sheets just sort of came apart. and after drying the sheets, they looked two years old,, completely pilled up with the softness totally gone. so the brand new sheets appear to be very old and used, after just one washing. and they are no longer soft, and rather scratchy to lie on."
2,ok,"This is just an ok product, it does it's job, however I expected a better quality since I need to wash it every day..."
3,Okay but there are better devotionals,"This devotional is okay but the problem with it is that C.S. Lewis is a very scholarly individual and to only get a few paragraphs sometimes misses the bigger logic of what he is trying to say. Some readings are good and the thought is ""self contained"" but many times he is developing a larger topic that really requires more reading. That's because each of these devotional pieces comes from his books, which take many pages to develop an idea(s). If you are familiar with C.S. Lewis, buy this book. If not, you might be better served started elsewhere (maybe Mere Christianity)."
5,Here Is a Wonderful Plate of Spiritual Finger-Food,"Two men express Christian thought that get my mind running: C.S. Lewis and Oswald Chambers. Meant as a daily devotional, this book is brilliant in its arrangement and content. (When I first opened it, I deserted any hopes of reading only one a day and read many a day.) You can't go wrong in purchasing this one."
5,Absolutely wonderful,I have never been an opera fan. Some things I like but more into other types of music. Paul Potts has changed my outlook completely. I have to play his CD at least once a day. His voice is so compelling. He is addicting! When he makes it to the United States I will be the first one to purchase tickets. Paul Potts will one day be a well recognized name.
5,"Awakens the Heart , the Soul and innermost passions within us . . .","With this album, Paul has opened the heart chakra's of the human race. From the time Paul was first presented to us on Britain's Got Talent, he has awakened hearts and souls with not only his voice, but his entire being. I cannot tell you how he and this album have moved me to tears, along with so many others. With his music, I feel that I have been transported through a portal to somewhere so special and beautiful I cannot describe it in words. I never want to leave the place where he takes me. I have bought several copies, and am purchasing several more. Thank you, Paul, your voice and your spirit are a rare gift to us and we love you. You have awakened us!"
5,Paul Potts is amazing.,"When I saw the UTube clip of Paul Potts winning the talent competition in England, I immediately wanted to hear more of his music. I am not 'into' opera, but I ordered this CD and couldn't wait for it to arrive. His voice is just amazing. It seems as if the 'powers that be' have given us a new talent in the very year that Pavarotti passed away from us. The CD must have been hurried because of the great demand engendered by that UTube clip, which was flying all over the Internet, but the music is really beautiful. I look forward to anything and everything that Paul Potts records in the future."
5,More! More!,"I couldn't wait for the American release and purchased the UK version of this album on CD. iTunes doesn't offer the full album but the songs that are offered are excellent. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the freshman effort of Mr.Potts with my favorite songs being Nessum Dorma, Time To Say Goodbye, Music Of The Night, and Ognuno Soffre (the Italian version of Everybody Hurts). Mr. Potts has a unique talent that is rare among singers to match the pitch of accompaniment perfectly while singing with great expression. His voice is youthful and flowing. Magnificent. I'm saddened by the news that Pavarotti passed away today. Although for different reasons, in my mind Mr. Potts provides every bit as much enjoyment as listening to Pavarotti. And so as one tenor fades into the twilight another rises like a renewed dawn. I look forward to more."
2,"Fine Voice, Badly Produced Album","Pleasant in single-cut doses, soporific in larger quantities, Paul Potts' one-hit wonder potential is high. The album ""One Chance"" is badly produced, as it only shows one facet of his fine voice. It leaves me wondering if slow lyrical songs with an orchestra are all he has to offer and/or wants to do. He at least needs a better manager, if not a better voice coach."
2,Paul Potts,I've never enjoyed opera but Paul Potts made me a opera lover. Know you will go on to do great things. I give you 6 STARS! Ruth Watts
2,Mixed Feelings,"The story behind Paul Potts is remarkable. He has a wonderful singing voice and you can't help but like his humbleness. I'm truly glad the world found Paul.The song mix on this CD is a little weird. It starts with opera, and then there is a rendition of My Way in Italian (I think), followed by Christmas songs. Hmm.Don't get me wrong, Paul Potts sings them all very nicely - it's just a bit of a strange mix."
5,Great listening experience.,"Comparing Paul Potts to more technically gifted opera singers totally misses the point of this cd and his singing. He pours so much emotion into his performance, a truly rare and wonderful experience. Bravo, bravo!"
3,better on t.v.,"The CD was a bit of a dissapointment to me. I enjoyed seeing Paul Potts on t.v. and was amazed by his voice. Perhaps this first CD was a little rushed to market, but his voice doesn't have as high quality on all of the tracks."
1,Where is it?,I ordered a CD of The Riverwalk Jazz Christmas album. I haven't heard anything nor seen it.
5,paul potts,"i watched Paul win the talent show in England. The guy has an unbelivable voice, and will be a major star within a short period of time. Love the CD."
5,Paul Potts review,I listen to this CD almost every day that I'm driving in my car. Every song is wonderful and I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone.
5,"One Chance, Paul Potts","This CD is absolutely fantastic. It has become my favorite and I play it often. Wow, what a voice. Best buy I have made for awhile."
3,Listner,"Pleased that Potts won the contest, the CD was disappointing. Not ready for prime time. I blame the CD creator for poor music selections for Potts debut album."
1,Runs Out of Gas and Hits the Wall,"What Potts brings to opera is not a trained voice, but a diamond in the rough kind of talent loaded with passion, and this CD could not deliver it all the way. It starts off strong, gets a little uneven but has its bright moments and then at the end, hits the all on the Christmas carols. OK, so when I bought the CD, I should have checked the play list, but when it comes to singing Christmas carols, Potts sounds like a frog in a can. What are they doing here? I knew I was not buying Luciano Pavarotti but I didn't care. I wanted the passion and what I got was a frog in a can ending."
4,Paul Potts One Chance,"Very good alblum by a talented guy. I could have done without the Christmas music, however."
5,Blown Away,I discovered Paul Potts like millions of others I am sure on YouTube but I absolutely love the way he sings. He has the ethereal and rare ability to some how sing past my ears and directly into my soul. I know that sounds weird but that is exactly what happens. I don't speak Italian and yet I understand what the songs are expressing. Its visceral and beautiful and I absolutely love this CD. Buy it... experience it... you won't be sorry you did!Danie HallAuthor
5,WOW!,"Saw Paul on YouTube. My first reaction was that he needed to see a dentist.Then, listened to his voice and fell in love. Voice so beautiful! A little worker drudging along with the rest of us. So thrilled and happy with his success.I bought 7 of his CDs for Christmas gifts and will need to purchase another 12 for friends that also viewed YouTube.God bless you Paul and family. A talent that seldom comes along."
4,A beautiful interpretation,"This is a well-rendered collection of what is essentially a ""tenor greatest hits"" album. He has a nice sound to him and I appreciate his backstory. A great gift."
5,Prophetic Words,"""I think what we have here is a lump of coal that is going to turn into a diamond!"" states the young lady on Britains Got Talent after Mr. Potts audition....and so he did. His debut CD is fantastic. That beautiful voice back by the classic instrumentation of the London Symphony not only prove he's turned into a diamond but that he's well on his way to being a classic himself....my only disappointment is that the pre-ordered CD only had 10 tracts and the reviews said there were 12. So, guess I'll just have to buy the other as well, one for the house, one for the car!"
4,I Cry Each Time I Hear His Voice,"I cried when I first heard Mr. Potts on YouTube, and his performance was just 3-minutes long! I am happy that he came out with a CD but felt it was rushed just to get his name out to the public and make some money (but good for him!). There are only 3 songs that I truly like and think they could've picked better songs for his voice and range. I am not an opera fan but will look forward to purchasing his next CD. Such a beautiful voice. Keep up the good work, Paul!"
3,Paul Rocks...Album Stinks...,"Technically I think others have been too kind about this album. I have witnessed Paul's amazing talent on live TV performances on YouTube and this recording doesn't seem to do him justice.In fact, I just watched Pavorotti's version and Paul's version (for the n'th time) on YouTube...and agree with previous commentators. I don't know what it is about Paul's voice, but his feeling and emotion are spine chilling. I cry every time.I am glad I bought this album solely in hope that they will make another one with a better producer who will better highlight his talent."
3,What happened???,"In the first Britain's Got Talent audition, it is evident both visually and musically that Paul is singing from the heart and is giving it all he's got. Somewhere between there and making this CD it is apparent he has been given some professional coaching in both the way he sings and in dialect. His soulful feeling that made the Paul Potts i enjoyed listening to has been lost in the world of commercial music. I will just keep watching the original videos for now."
2,"Paul Potts ""One Chance""","The Sample Bytes on the Webpage sounded Great.When I received the CD, I was very disappointed.He sounded Like an amateur...There was no depth or substance in his voice.Maybe it was the choice of songs......Most of the songs were recorded by another English Artist (Russell Watson)and Mr. Potts cannot compareto the feelings Mr. Watson puts in his version of the songs.....Take ""Caruso"" and ""Nella Fantasia"" Mr. Potts sounded as I said like an amateur and had no training....I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone....."
1,ONE CHANCE HOPE,"I hope Paul gets a better chance than this CD at showing his voice. This is the absolutely worst CD recording of a great voice I ever have heard. The U-Tube showings delivered a great stirring voice and it was a thrill as most say. But this CD is poor. It is flat. There is no base. His Nessun Dorma quality falls way below his initial powerful stage experiences on the talent show. His voice is overshadowed and drowned out by the musical instrumentation. The richness he showed on stage never comes out in this CD. To me, it is a flop. Simon et al let him down with a poor recording. What a pity."
1,Lux is not what it used to be,"I bought 2 of these, one white and one black, to replace the lux timer that I had for more years than I want to admit to. I am sorry to say that the new lux timers are made from a cheaper quality plastic. It looks as if one fall to the kitchen floor would be end of it. Secondly, it didn't work. You are supposed to dial the timer past 30 minutes, then to the desired time. No ticks, no nothing. I tried dialing back to 60 as with the old timer, but that did not work either. The black timer was even worse. The dialer was loose and broken from the get-go. I returned both. Big disappointment. I prefer a mechanical timer so that I don't have to worry about replacing a battery at a crucial time. I then ordered the Fox Run Retro Kitchen Timer with magnet. Now there is a solid good looking timer that works. It is metal, attaches to refrig (or anything else metal), is off the counter, takes little room, looks good, and it works!"
3,Nothing fancy,But works well for price. The ringing when the timer reaches zero could be a little louder for those who are hard of hearing or on other side of house.
3,Works Just Fine,"Probably not as ""cute"" or ""high-tech"" as one of the fancy electronic digital timers, but it works.If you don't expect to need timing longer than an hour, go with it. It's got a nice little bell that goes off when it's done, and I, for one, am getting really sick of the electronic ringers on alarms, phones, and timers.Other reviewers are complaining about ""junk made in China"", and I agree; I'm getting really tired of not being able to find the simplest gadget that's not made in the USA... on the other hand, a lot of people want ""$cheap$"", and don't care about quality; until we start complaining (like in the reviews of this thing), and the big guys are unable to get things made over there for a quarter a day, it's not going to change.We haven't had this timer long enough to see how long it lasts before falling apart, but so far, it's working."
4,Lux Mechanical Classic Timer,"this Lux Mechanical Classic Timer, works but i need a timer that the buzzer stays on longer that 30 seconds"
2,Worked well for six months...,"I thought the Lux Kitchen Timer was a no-brainer. Grandma had one. Mom had one. I'll never buy another one.A simple timer that should have sat on my kitchen counter for years is now broken and headed for a landfill. All I did was turn it to ""twenty minutes"" and something inside snapped.Six months isn't a long life.ADDENDUM: I sent this review to Lux and they responded. They said the timer is still under warranty and they're willing to replace it but I don't think I'll bother."
3,Not so great.,This timer is not so great. The bell rings before the time is up. I would not buy another one.
1,Timer not accurate,"When I cooked with this timer, I discovered the food was not done. Then I checked the accuracy of the timer and found it is off by several minutes. I wouldn't recommend this timer to anyone."
2,Not impressed,"I was really surprised by the cheap build. The picture shows dark numbers and logo and I assumed they were recessed. Mine has white printed numbers and logo which look really tacky. They aren't recessed and will likely rub off with any use. The thing that actually made my jaw drop, though, is that the back is open. If you turn the timer around, you see the metal timing mechanism held in place with a single screw into black plastic. I'm disappointed that the build is so cheap. Two stars because the faux copper finish is convincing."
1,short life,Stopped working the second time I used it...glad I was paying attention or would have had burnt brownies. What did I expect for less than $6. Not worth the trouble to send it back but don't buy it.
1,Timeless,"My grandfather's Lux Minute Minder lasted for years and years, but my brand new one didn't go a month (about 10 uses). Very sad waste of a reputation. It does throw well, however. Very dramatic - I'm still finding pieces under the furniture."
2,Not very good...,"It doesn't seem to be of very good quality, just cheap plastic. It also seems to have problems setting the time some times. It's hard to get it to shut off some times too. Also, it constantly makes a ticking noise, which is very annoying if you are trying to focus on something."
1,Forget it!,Carma II was GREAT! I loved it! A great way to take out my aggressiveness at the end of a hard day! And nobody gets hurt! Carma 3 SUCKED! I'm not even going to be kind on this one. I was VERY disappointed with the entire game and trashed it within a half hour after installing it.
4,"Excellent Game, though not quite the first one.","I won't address all the details, as they've been covered previously. But Carmageddon Two was the dissapointment of the series for me. Three is back to old form. While I still prefer the original to TDR, this one is still a wonderful game. True, it's harder to get actual time in a race. Hence the ""Free Driving"" mode, where you can take the timer out all together. The missions on the second were random and at times pointless. Not the case here, each mission is interesting at least, and with the 3 race/ 3 mission setup on each level it isn't too frustrating. If you liked the first one, this is definently worth trying. Skip #2, not #3."
5,Even the non Civil War buffs enjoyed looking through it,"I bought this for my dad, another of many books on the subject, I had gotten him over the years. He loves it and spends a lot of time pouring over the maps and reading it. Before I gave it to him it was sitting on my coffee table for a short time and guests in my home enjoyed it also and were very intrigued by the effect a good map verses a poor map had on the outcome of a battle. So many war books obsess on weapons so I also found it refreshing."
1,eagle speed sensor,Was not the correct item that stated it would fit my eagle. It did not work. I was unable to obtain a return item number so I am stuck with an item that is of no use to me.
5,Serenity,I am really enjoying these chimes. They are high quality and the tune is so melodious. I love hearing them because they make me feel calm and serene.
5,The best gongs ever,"When the wind blows and you hear the warm, rich, deepest tones of these chimes, you'll say: Really worth the bucks!"
2,Jerry b-boring Bonham,"in his defense, jerry was awesome opening for PVD last year in los angeles. thus, i picked up this cd set to enhance my liking of his talents. rather than enjoying his trance music, i was succumbed into a damn trance on my couch! there is basically no energy on these cds and they were a huge disappointment. the music doesn't even begin to kick in until the 8th track on the 2nd cd. boooring. jerry, please release something that reflects your talent or otherwise your audience will be too asleep to even notice you're playing or buy your material."
5,Not just another classic Masterpiece but an out of body EXPERIENCE,This was a fantastical trip through the fairytale land of the extrodinary Beatles. I couldnt believe how many times I got enlightened. Made me LOVE NEW ZEALAND EVEN MORE! THOSE NZ GIRLS ARE COOL OUT THERE!
2,Not for Carlon wireless doorbell system...only for chime system,I bought this for my wireless Carlon doorbell system and it did not work. It seems that there is a difference between the Carlon wireless doorbell system and the Carlon wireless chime system. This should be spelled out in the product description. Gave it 2 stars because of the lack of complete details in description. It probably works fine for the chime system. Check what you have before purchasing.
5,Top of the Line 5 Disk Changer!,"Earlier I had Philips 5 DVD changer and it really disappointed me with not playing most of the disks, I'm really exicted to see the results and the response time on this player. Sony has once again marked its presence by giving a great DVD player. If you are looking for a player with 5 disk capacity then u don't have to think of any other player other than this one! It plays all formats including DVD+R, CD-R, CD-RW, MP3. It produces excellent sound, superb picture. If you have a AV reciever and you want to get the best out of the player then u must connect it with Optical Cable and if u happen to have a progressive scan TV then Component Video Cable is strongly recommended for the ultimate picture quality. With all the features and ease of use, its a overall winner!The only negetive point i came across is that this player doesn't display the folders in the actual tree form the way they are stored on a disk."
4,THIS IS FOR A 10 SPEAKER,"disreguard those reviews for those who cant read a measureing tape,,this is for a 10 inch speaker,,well made,,however very poor chroming quality at the center of cover,,,delivery was pretty quick,,bout week,,,,i would recommend this item for the money its a great deal,,i give it a 4 out of 5"
3,Hard to reproduce that live sound...,"Lemonade isn't a bad album, it's just that they're so much better live. The record just sounds so *average*. I mean, my favorite thing about Box Set are those incredible harmonies they do. Talk about tight and wow!, what melodies! Unfortunately, they only pull that off on one song on the album - the first track. The rest is just cookie cutter post-hippie rock. Maybe next one. But in the meantime - go see them at a club near you!"
5,Complete Windows NT Security - Start to Finish!,"Whether you're an MCSE or an amateur in Windows NT security, this book is for you! It steps through each aspect of Windows NT Server 4.0 security while explaining how to secure NT for YOUR organazation - be it a small network of computers in your garage or servers in a corporate WAN. Teaching you to take the stand point of a hacker, the Windows NT Server Security Handbook is a MUST for anyone concerned with security."
3,Battery dies when left in device.,I used it briefly when I got it and allowed the battery to remain in it for a couple of weeks. Today when I took it out to use it again the battery had died.
4,VERY CUTE!,"The ""Backpack Bear"" is perfect for my 3yr old. It is the perfect size and fits enough small toys for a long card ride. It is very soft and lovable. He loves it! Others I had purchased were too small for him and didn't hold enough. For the tiny tot animal lover - this is great."
4,Sehr gut,"I bought this costume because it was cute and more modest (ie- it won't show off any bits and pieces, and it's not risqué) Great if you have a Halloween dress up day at work. It is made of good materials (velvet), and isn't cheaply crafted (no mystery fabrics). That and it's the most affordable of the fraulein costumes.My only advise is that unless you are slender, this might not be the best costume for you. At my measurements of 36-26-38, it fit me perfectly, but I really don't see how anyone who is a larger size than me would fit.Another thing that made me happy with this dress is that although the picture depicts a more orange hue on the skirt, it is actually a nice red.It makes it more authentic looking if you ask me.Overall, I am very pleased with my dress. Sehr Gut! Ja!"
2,Not too terrable!,"I have this video I can't remember what I paid for it but its not so great. First of all the hunt takes place on a very small game ranch in Missouri called High Adventure Ranch. There are a few hogs killed with various weapons, rifle, blackpowder, and even a Desert Eagle 50 AE. Anyway if you have everything else, in the pig hunting theme then get it. Its probably worth the 10$ anyway."
5,Super for Polished Serfaces,"This is the only thing I will use on the screen of my HDTV. Works great. After one screen clean, I use the cloth for regular dusting where it works better than anything else I have tried. I use it many times and wash it several times before starting a new one."
3,Looks good.,Grill is not used yet but looks very good. Although I complained of the size as I received it. It is just good for batchelor and not for my size of family. I considering constructing a stand for it to raise it up higher than the it is now so that I can use it properly.
5,"""Facts alone seldom persuade and rarely inspire""","Drawing upon ten years' worth of research, The Leader's Voice is a collaborative examination by Boyd Clarke and Ron Crossland of how effective leaders communicate. Taking into account the hard-wiring of human brains, the importance of using three channels of communication (facts, emotions, and symbols), the dynamic and effective behaviors of skilled leaders, and much more, The Leader's Voice is a strongly recommended and highly accessible guide for anyone in a position of responsibility, whether in a business or within a community group. ""Facts alone seldom persuade and rarely inspire,"" warns this informed and informative guide, summing up a sometimes frustrating yet undeniable facet of human nature. If you want to persuade and inspire as well as share facts, then The Leader's Voice is invaluable reading from cover to cover."
3,Very European,"This is really pretty. However, I didn't read the small print. It is sized for European paper towel rolls which are shorter and slimmer. Consequently, part of the paper towel roll shows over the top. Someone has mentioned that it wouldn't hold the jumbo sizes of paper towels. It also looked like it would fingerprint very easily. It seemed well made."
3,"Not bad for the price, but one serious flaw.","Installation wasn't too hard, but you'll need 2 people...one to hold the platform and the other to screw in the 3"" lag bolts. It's a little noisy when hitting the bag, much more so than the $2-300 speed bags...but the price is good so its acceptable. What isn't acceptable is that the height adjustment screws don't keep the platform from sliding up and down the track when you hit the bag. I've tightened them as much as I can and they still don't hold it in place. Of course you could rig something up to stop it from moving..but that takes away the functionality of it being adjustable in the first place."
3,Good graphics average game,"I got this game after seeing the movie and it does not follow the story line. It is an O.K.game but lacks real fun. It has no multi player mode and all you do in the levels is run around killing people. You never have to think or solve puzzles. I would recomend some thing fun you can play with freinds ( madden, pac man etc. ) Don't get this unless you are bored & have a lot of spare cash or a die hard X-men fan."
3,It's O.K.,"Not as much running from the popo like NFSMW. The drifting is pretty fun. The game looks more like a port from a console than a game designed for PC. Have a beefy gaming pc, or turn the eye-candy off to get playable framerates."
5,"Bought this game when old, but it is still awesome","Needed to buy a few more copies of this game for a tournament I was throwing, and NFS collector's edition is still the bomb."
3,shouldn't be out in stores,like i download a demo of that and their is a crew member that wants to copy you only in curcit race and you spin out of controal sometimes but it is kind of a good demo butthe good part is that i can win in a race but they are trying to make you go into the race so you couldbe in the race.
4,Great Game!,"Need for Speed Carbon was a great game, a fun feature in the game was the full costuminization none of my cars looked the same. The reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the fact that the game is really short; I just wish it were longer."
4,Stainless Steel Room,"It looks good from a distance but when you touch it, you know it is rather cheap. However, since I put it in a spot where touching is not an option, it looks well enough. Hope it holds up over time."
3,Silly little quality trash can,"I ordered this thinking it was ""normal"" size. My bad! I thought I would share this so I help someone else if they are thinking this trash can is something you would put on the floor and use. This is more of a counter top model. I would use it at a coffee shop for throwing away sugar packages or something.. ha ha I don't know. Its great quality and for the price I figured much bigger. Still not sure what I will do with it. Should have returned it but I forgot!"
2,Small trash for this trash can,I know its a trash can but I don't know how to use it unless I produce small garbage that fits perfectly in it. At least its nice to look at.
5,"quite simply, the best","ambient music unparalleleed in its depth, ingenuity, and warmth. i fancy myself a connoisseur of ambient and related genres. in my humble opinion, nothing (with perhaps the exception of eno's AIRPORTS) comes close to these brilliantly conceived, lushly recorded soundscapes.i collect this series like baseball cards. buy a couple, you'll see why.of special note: apparently, instinct records has lisenced individual songs, as well as the em:t artwork and logo, for stateside release. instinct's compilations are different from the ones released by time recordings (which are the ones soleilmoon distributes). if you collect both, you'll find many double-occurrences and the like.for those interested in this kind of music, also check out woob's two full-length releases (on the same label). you won't be disappointed..."
2,buy it at amazon . de for less,What kind of sharks are out there offering this for $54???get it for a normal price from amazon . dealso garland jeffrys has a great dvd out did you know that??
1,Don't buy it,"Since I seem to break glass carafes with frustrating frequency, I thought a stainless steel one would make my life easier. Unfortunately, this one isn't made very well. It leaks where the handle is attached, which means you will get coffee all over the counter, making a big mess to clean up. I wasted my money, hopefully you won't waste yours."
1,Waste of money,"I too hoped that this would fix the problem of breaking carafes. Unfortunately, this one pours so badly that most of the coffee spills all over the counter. After I finish writing this I will be ordering a new glass carafe."
3,Stainless Steel Coffee Carafe.,"Stainless Steel Coffee Carafe. Nice idea, needs work.Tired of replacing broken glass carafes for your coffee maker? This is a good unbreakable container, or at least the coffee container is. The cover snaps on, and the two plastic hooks on the container holding the plastic cover are easily broken. Whatever. I make do with one unbroken hook to keep the cover on while making coffee. The pouring spout is rather wide and prone to spillage, so I reshaped it and made it narrower by using a ball peen hammer and the top surface of a bench vise. If you use it as is, pour the coffee very slowly to get it into the cup and not on the table as well."
3,Where's the carrot?,"Did you ever get the sense that you were reading a book that just dangled a carrot in front of you so you'd keep reading? Well, I had that feeling while reading this book. The problem is, in other books, I was being led somewhere that made me jump.No jumping here. Once I grabbed hold of the carrot it disappeared. When I finished the book, I was still expecting more. (Kind of like the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series.)The world set up is quite interesting but never did I feel smacked across the face by what happened.For something more captivating check out ""The Time of the Dark""."
5,A Piece of Japan,I did this piece in just a couple of weeks. It works up fast and the shadings and colors are really nice. Chart was easy to read and very clear on symbols. Colors were listed by bunch for sorting and like colors were put in separate bunches so easy to identify. This was a blue ribbon winner at the fair.
2,"Well, it didn't really work","This cable seams to have a decent build quality, but to use it from a PC to a TV, the cable does not fix the change in format. You need a much more expensive part to do that."
3,Can't use it to play Dish Network on your computer,I believe this was stated in the description but I was too stubborn to listen and they were too cheap to send back.
3,It truly is a one way cable,"Even with all the reviews I took a chance to see if I could use it to transmit a signal from my laptop (VGA) through an analog /digital converter and send a signal to my TV. No success. This cable only goes one way from RCA to VGA not the other way around even with an analog converter. The saving grace, I spent less than $6 for the item so I can live with the risk I took."
1,Doesn't work.,"Given the product's title: VGA to Component Video, you would expect to be able to take this cable and connect the VGA plug on your computer to the Component inputs on your TV.Well that does not work at all. Some reviewers have stated that the cable works for other purposes. If so, great.However I ordered this cable based on the title, and it did not work at all for that purpose.It almost feels like fraud to state ""Component Video"" in the title, when in fact this cable is not outputting component video."
4,VGA to RCA component,"Tried using this to play my ps2 on my lcd screen, but didn't work. Set up was PS2 using component cable -> receiver -> lcd screen. I probably didn't set it up correctly or it wasn't meant to be used this way so I do not blame the cables."
2,Only works 1 way,"I bought this cable to plug into my 22"" computer moniter so that i could use it as a TV. Unfortunately, it does not convert component video to VGA. However, it does work the other way for those few HDTV's that do not accept VGA inputs"
1,Doesn't work,I tried using this to display a power point presentation and it would not work at all. I tried it on 4 different TV's and it would even show up on two of them and the other two had a black and white static/blurry shadow of what was supposed to be there. Do not buy!!
1,Gift,cannot say if it was good or bad because the person who recieved it never made a comment so I am not sure..
2,Dusty but useful in some ways,"This video was evidently transfered from a movie (the type you would watch in grade school on days when it was raining during recess.) As a result, the sound track is not always perfectly in sync with the picture, and the color is pretty horrendous. This video is only 20 minutes long, which came as something of a surprise to me. The video instroduces some instruments of Middle Eastern music, as well as providing a brief history of the spread of Islamic culture. Some virtuosic performances and some ethnic dances round out the production. All of this without getting too deep (what do you expect for 20 minutes?) This video looks like it was probably shot in the mid to late 1960's and was transferred to VHS in 1987..."
4,Great as expected,"As one would expect from what Rhapsody and Luca Turilli have done so far, this is a great album,why would you want to pay more for a ltd edition? well this one has an xtra cd that not only bears some xtra tracks but is also an interactive cd for you to enjoy on your pc that has wallpapers a screensaver and videos. The two cd's come inside a Book-format book which is great and inside has a recopilation of the Rhapsody story so far and interviews and fun stuff to read inside. The music as usual is very epic and powerfull ,telling a tale of a medieval hero and good vs evil. I liked it,if you liked the other Rhapsody stuff then you'll like this one."
4,HAIL!!!!!,"Finally, the third and last chapter of the Emerald sword saga is here and its AMAZING!!well its not as much groundbreaking as Symphony of the Enchanted lands but this is a very nice follow up!the music on this album is just like the other two, only it is more agressive and it has less catchy choruses,but dont worry all the right elements are still here...so if you are looking for aan album that can make you feel like a warrior on a Quest than this ia for you!!!!!"
4,Lamps,"The replacement lamps are available on Amazon for as cheap as $4.99. They are easy to replace. Unscrew the lens cover, pull out the lamp and unscrew two screws that connect the wires to the lamp. There is a style of lamp with No. LL4515 and an alternate with the No. ZB4515. LL is a sort of generic no name brand. ZB is a GE lamp that will give you a whiter light and longer life. I had no problem finding the lamps in town. Any professional music store will have them."
2,alright,its a good product... i just did not like the fact that it doesnt change colors or anything like that. but again for the price you cannot go wrong
4,Works Well . . .,"Really liked this product, good for keys and mail collection and a quick look at yourself. Compact but not small. Only problem I had was hanging it correctly but that could have been my own fault."
3,Work-out Song!,I love this song...and totally look forward to more music from Dante'. He has a great voice and I love the beat. I work out to this song everyday. You have got to get it!!
5,Excellent book that covers all the basics,"This is an excellent book that covers all the basics. From buying a car to how the engine runs, everything is here. Beyond just telling you what kind of battery to buy, or what kind of oil you need, the author explains how the engine runs so that you can build your own car know-how. In addition to the ""how & why"" information that is presented, the author provides ""tech tips"" that give the reader the insight of an obviously experienced mechanic and share the author's ""learned by experience"" ideas. The book also comes with a CD containing projects and learning worksheets, and provides websites for interactive learning opportunities beyond what is on the written page. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the basics about their car, and the experienced car owner will no doubt benefit from the ""tech tips"" and the extras included in the book."
2,Not worth it,"This book does not provide me with many answers. It's written as a textbook for school (since when were you able to take car care classes in school??), and thus it makes no recommendations and doesn't dare to give you a straight answer. I hardly know anything about cars and could use a book to give me an overview, instructions and recommendations. However, this book does not include all aspects that I would expect (e.g. there's nothing in the book about rims - what rims will work on my car?, nothing about trailers, nothing about roof storage boxes etc.). There are no graphics of how to do actual car care - rather theres bulletpoint textlists on the included (bad) CD and text studying questions ""to assist instructors"" - not what I need as a carowner. Further, the troubleshooting guide is painfully bad. There must be better titles out there for use by the individual carowner. This book is not worth the money."
4,A Christmas present,"I bought this along with Picnic as a Christmas present for a friend who hadn't heard Robert Earl Keen. Of course, it doesn't include ALL his best work... any collection that did would be REALLY big :)"
1,disapointment,"totally disappointed. just a few clips, and they weren't even LONG clips.I expected full games and left let down.Wimbledon is GREAT, this DVD is not. If you're a tennis fan or player... look elsewhere for footage"
5,"CONNIE FRANCIS, QUEEN OF SONGS.","There will never be a singer like Connie Francis, not in this lifetime. Connie has made it through the difficult times, and yet still comes back on top. She has a voice of gold. Ms. Francis you are an inspiration to all of these young singers of today. They do not have the guts; nor the determination to beat all odds regardless of what difficulties that may lie ahead. Sal Ferrara,"
5,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!,"[...]Connie Francis is at her glamorous, amorous best in this show. She looks sensational, her costumes are dazzling, her voice is outstanding and the audience absolutely adores her; and rightfully so, she is, by far, the international best selling female recording artist of ALL time, bar none!And with people downloading singles these days as opposed to actually buying albums & CD's like they used to, it's safe to say that that is a record that will NEVER BE BROKEN!Singing in 13 languages for the past 50 years as a recording artist and 68 years as a performing artist (since age 4), this woman is a national treasure, pop icon and living legend all rolled up into one. And most of all, she is a survivor; which is what inspires, excites & ignites us all!God bless you Connie Francis!"
3,Tries Too Hard To Be Clever,"I bought this thinking it was the soundtrack to the excellent BBC production of the Gormenghast trilogy that aired on PBS.It's not- it's an abbreviated opera. And while it has its moments, it's rather silly.The music often goes nowhere - I suppose some would say that's the point, since the Gormenghast story is basically about people who are trapped. But, forsaking substance for style is usually the ""solution"" of someone who can't come up with the goods.It's a passable effort, but it's not something that will live with you."
3,Not what it should be,"I purchased this pillow because I love the ones they used in my hotel in Chicago. I read the label & saw they were fossfill & got the phone number for the company that made them. They had gone out of business! So, I ordered this product thinking it would be the same; it is not! It knots up and gets hard as a brick. I have to fluff it several times a night. I'm very dissappointed & won't be ordering another from this company."
2,uneven and too thin,I bought from the internet I had before the feather ck but i became allergic i thought theses will be similar but they are far differennt. u can say they are underfilled
4,Pretty good annunciation,"It does what it says it is supposed to do. Easy to install and set up. Only concern is that even at full volume it isn't super loud, but it's probably loud enough. The unit it replaced had been much louder, but is no longer available. Overall a decent product."
2,T&B extend-a-chime.,"Worked okay after installing but quit after less than a year.I think the price was reasonable but disapointed with theperformance. I know that T&B; produces very good quality as Ihave made use of their products for many, many years."
2,Works if close,Works if within straight line of vision between sender and receiver. I've had it within 25 feet and still would only sometimes work. It's a great idea - if it would work consistently. I have 900mhtz phones plus wireless Internet so maybe one of those conflict.
1,Not reliable enough,"Usually the remote chime is only heard if someone presses the doorbell twice or holds it for a long time. I need it to work if someone presses the doorbell once quickly, which is what all the delivery guys do."
1,Piece of Junk,"I hooked it all up, selected a chime, and it literally chimed once. I changed the chime to a different sound and it worked ONCE with that chime and then never again. I picked this item above all the others on Amazon because it was a Thomas & Betts and they have always had quality stuff but their name is on the packaging only. The chime has the brand name Carlon who seems to provide most of the doorbell extenders on this site with various different names. Not only will I never buy this brand but I'll not longer buy Thomas & Betts, though I doubt they'll ever read this review (or even care)."
1,True to title,"The title is absolutely true. But it's fairly easy to simply leave out the eggs and add a little dairy. That's all she's done. To nearly every recipe. Page after page after page. If you haven't baked much, and if you have no dairy intolerence/allergy, the book could be helpful. If you're a long-time baker who's looking for some insight on how to continue baking with a restricted diet, don't waste your money on this book. Pick up you're old Betty Crocker or Joy of Cooking, look at the recipe, take out the eggs, add some dairy as binding, and voila, you've got this book."
1,"Frustrated, gave up!","I am amazed at all the rave reviews for this book. I have tried quite a few cake and cookie recipes trying to give this a fair shake. The first cake fell like a stone, the next one stuck in the pan, the next one was heavy but ok. The jelly cookies were ok but after several more cookies that spread out to thin or were not cooked I give up! I have been baking for years and follow recipes exactly but I am challenged to bake without eggs or peanuts for my son. I don't think I will use this book again because it irritates me so."
4,Great cheesecake!,"I've tried several recipes, and all have been great so far. The cheesecake recipe is phenomenal and I can't tell there aren't any eggs. Some of the recipes could use a little tweaking and I'd like to see a little more explanation about what replaces eggs in each particular recipe so I could apply this to other recipes."
4,Good club for the price.,"I bought this in need of sand and lob wedges. I really had never practiced with these types of clubs before, and could not get a solid strike with them, but I got better with time. These clubs helped a lot with chipping and pitching shots, too. I did find them a bit shorter than standard wedges, but then again, I am 6 feet tall, so maybe I needed longer ones all the while. I would recommend trying these out, because they're pretty comfortable, and the grips will blow you away."
5,Replaces separate solvent and oil,Replaces separate solvent and oil bottles. The best all in one to use ... hands down! Keeps clean guns clean.
1,outraged,"I haven't heard the music, but just looking at the picture I am upset that amazon would even offer it, that is nudity and not appropriate. At least you shouldn't put the picture unless someone buys it and should be warned beforehand. This is the first time I am not satisfied going to your company. I am afraid to click on another search!"
4,X-men The Offical Game Misleading?,"I'm a huge X-men fan and I'm a fan of the movies. But I must admit this game was a bit misleading. After all I thought it was going to be based on The Last Stand due to it being ""The Offical Game"" but to my surprise it Isn't. Instead you play between X2 and X3 as Wolverine, Night Crawler and Ice-man. So after discovering what the game was all about, I bought it. I must admit it is rather enjoyable, but I still would have liked to play the story of the Last Stand instead. I would also like to say that I'm unhappy about the cut scenes. Since there more like moving art pieces than CG or clips of the films. All in all I dound the game enjoyable regardless, but I must warn that it has absolutely nothing to do with the film. In conclusion this game is good but next time they should just do a movie based version instead."
1,Infomercial,"Disguised as a regular video about Australia, this is a dull infomercial. Only one person speaks throughout the video -- the narrator. Little historical background is offered except for mentions that some buildings were built by convict labor. Shots of koalas and kangaroos are the only animal coverage. Even more aggravating, promotional spots for Hilton and Budget Rent-A-Car are woven into the narrative."
2,Mediocre,"I have to admit that I did get some tidbits, but I found this book was either far too simple or that it had too few instructions for the procedures. Also, the projects were not in my taste as I hate the ""country"" look. There really was not much restoration or preservation in it and it mostly involved the taking of old items and spending a lot of time making them look new so that you can then spend too much time making them look ""fake"" old.Sorry - just not my taste."
3,STONES,STONES ARE REALLY NEAT. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS. STONES ARE USED IN JEWLERY AND MINERALS. SUCH AS GEMS THERE LIKE BIRTHSTONES AND CAN BE PERFECT FOR ANY OCCASTION.
3,Looks good and it works,"[Good]Looks great and it seems like it's a quality product from the exterior, so far it's been fine. However it should be noted that this is my first flask, nor do I regularly drink out of it.[Bad]I don't like deceptive marketing: Yes it's manufactured by a German based firm, however it's actually made in China.Price: It's not cheap."
2,Stainless Steel 12 cup carafe,"Very flimsy - cheaply made. No adapters for stop drip feature on most coffeemakers. More sturdy than glass, though."
5,Great fit and look,I ordered this to go with a Price-Pfister shower and tub spout set I had bought. They do not make the drain in this color. I found this item and it goes perfectly. The price is great. The installation was simple. I highly recommend this.
5,What's worse than being broke?,"Being broken? Actually, no. Brokenness is something to be attained. Brokenness sets us apart from the masses pretending to be okay. We don't have to be ""all that."" Someone else wants to be that for us. Burnett reveals how we can live a blessed and even prosperous life when we enter this honest and vulnerable state of brokenness and allow God to be everything we need."
4,Twistede Sister Leftovers,"This CD is a collection of leftovers from Twisted Sister leader Dee Snider with a new band. I got this CD for Christian metal which Dee is dead on- they've earned the right to do whatever they want. This decade metal went grass roots. Highlights are Hardcore, Desperado and The Wanderer. Credit Dee for at least sticking to his guns on this ill fated CD. Twisted forever..."
3,"Good content, horrible book quality...","I have no complaints about the content of the book or it's author, but the book itself has completely fallen apart. The spine completely detached from the cover within 2 weeks after I got it. I never kept it in a backpack or tossed it around either. When asked by our professor if we liked this particular book because she wanted feedback on whether or not she should use it again the next semester, almost every single student had the same complaint as I did, as their books had all fallen apart after minimal use."
2,Not uplifting,"This book was not what I was expecting. I love to read about the wonderful things that are there on the Other Side, what it might look like, who we might see there, in other words, POSITIVE things to look forward to. This book goes from sad details of a miserable life to a brief heaven experience and then quickly segues into dire predictions for the future in a rather choppy writing style. I also recognized the LDS influence and was surprised that she didn't mention the church. I wonder if she's sent Mr. Hinckley a copy of her book.I highly recommend reading Sylvia Browne's books instead, especially ""Life on the Other Side"". She herself has had a NDE."
1,medical impossibilities in story suggests all is fiction,As a retired M D I found the medical aspects of her story so full of unbelievable nonsense that I find the rest of her story not credible. This is the only book I've ever bought that I threw away!
4,"A sturdy, roomy mailbox","I like this mailbox because it locks, and it has plenty of room for the mail. On the other hand, it's a bit plain looking, and it needs to be locked at all times, or the door will swing open. I can't comment on the leaking issue as mine hangs under a porch roof.Personally, I think it should come with more than two keys.It was quite a bit cheaper on Amazon than similar boxes at local hardware stores."
5,one for every job,"These cutting mats are really great - making a meal is a lot easier now as I have a cutting surface for each type of food and I feel very confident about not having any cross over contamination. The mats have an image of the food type on the corner of the mat - this is brilliant and makes it impossible to make a mistake. Being flexible makes it so easy to carry the food to a bow, sink, or pan - it's just great!"
4,Americana from New York via Nashville,"Call it what you want, folk country americana, it's all here. there is even a waltz, a damn fine one too. Purchased this CD from Trooper at a show, and he is even more open live than on disc. Buy this and amaze your friends, I have and do>"
2,dosen't last,This makes a good night light but the vapor doesn't last very long and it's expensive. You can buy eucalyptus oil and put it by your heater/furnace vents and get the aroma throughout the entire house.
3,Fair depiction of Tomiki's overview of classical aikido.,"This book is by Nobuyoshi Higashi 7d of the Japan Aikido Assn. It includes the San Kata and Yon Kata (3rd and 4th sets of classical forms) created by Kenji Tomiki, as well as some of Higashi's own self-defense forms. The descriptions are rough, and exclude finer points which would lead to proper execution of the techniques. This book would serve as a loose reference for Tomiki practitioners, and might be of histographic interest to others who study Aikido.One interesting point was relating the jo (stick) techniques to their origin as spear techniques, which makes sense out of the formal, thrusting attack.Tomiki's katas are remarkable in their comprehensiveness and depth of principle, and this is the only reference widely available"
3,"Good, but not Tyranny","I first heard Shadow Gallery about two years ago when I picked up Tyranny. It completely blew me away!! I was brought up listening to Rush, ELP and Yes. Over time, I've developed a love and admiration for bands like Dream Theater, Queensryche, Marillion and Fates Warning. Shadow Gallery ranks right up there. Legacy continues to show the skill of these incredible musicians, but it's not Tyranny. The instrumental sections are very long, and there's not much happening when you consider some of their older material. My personal favorites on the record are Colors, and the first ten minutes of ""First Light."" Also, the tremendous vocal melodies from the last record are just not here. They attempt it, but it does not have the same effect. A good record, but SG is going down, not up."
4,Good product; not happy with the container,"The product lives up to its cost and claims. However, the container makes me bit worried. No, it is not the size of the container (of course, it would be nice if they can match the size of the 2 lbs container with the quantity it contains -- currently the bottle is so big that it comes half empty) that I am concerned about; it is about the seal. One can easily open and close the bottle without removing the plastic seal/stripe. That is, the cap is not totally tamper-proof. Hope the company would address this so that customers can buy the product with more confidence."
3,Middle Of The Road,"This particular protein mixes reasonably well without clumping.The flavor is not great, nor is it bad. It is without the ""protein"" flavor of other products.This is a highly isolated protein, and carries a significant cost factor. It is probably very high quality, if price is any indication.There are chocolate chips in the mixture, which is baffling since they don't add to the overall flavor, and sink to the bottom of my shaker where they get rinsed down the drain. An unnecessary extravagance that most serious protein users could do without."
1,This book is ok at best,"I recently purchased this book. If you rely on this book for your ads and other marketing pieces, you won't do well. You need to study better direct response marketing books, such as Dan Kennedy's The Ultimate Sales Letter and Robert Bly's The Complete Idiot's Guide to Direct Marketing. This book has some good scripts for radio advertising but that'a about it. I thought about just throwing this book in the trash."
2,Mine didn't look like the picture,"Mine looks absolutely nothing like the picture on the page. I got a grey cave that is taller than wide (so not great for corn snakes) and it also had some leafy plant attachment. I wanted something more like the picture above, which is why I ordered it."
1,unacceptable packaging,"I am pretty sure the seller of the two Exo terra reptile cave's that I purchased found the smallest box they could stuff them in and sent it , with little to no package protection such as peanuts-bubble wrap- air bags-etc.... very unhappy with this products being that both of the caves are broken into about 4 pieces each... Step it up guys"
2,Mic does not come with the system,I bought this system with the idea that the system would come with the lavalier mic as described in the product details. It did not come with it and when I contacted Sam Ash they said they do not sell the combined system and I would have to send the whole system back for a refund. I was not happy with this and someone should make this right. I bought this thinking that this price included the mic.
2,A wrong choice,"If you don't care about your looks, that's the shirt for you...It is very loosely stitched, the fabric is neither attractive nor comfortable.....not at all recommended!"
2,"Honey, I shrunk the Tshirt!!",After the first washing the shirt shrunk much more than I have ever seen. It was a very nice product for one wearing. Then off to the Goodwill
3,Hawaiian stereotype portrayed,"As a Hawaiian (75%) I was bothered by how the Hawaiians were portrayed compared to other ethnicities. Sarah (Kale)is a liar when she does not tell Alika that her former husband (James Kanehoa) is at Honokohua. James Kanehoa is a drunk and wife abuser. Maka, is a rapist and murderer. Kanekuapu'u (fourth husband and minister) is an adulterer. It surprised me that caucasions were incapable of such acts.Even the British Admiral is exonerated for his dastardly act of overthrowing the kingdom. The rest of the book is fine, but why are Hawaiians portrayed in this light?"
4,review,"Asiago is one of my favorite cheeses. It is great to cut into small cubes and have with wine, or to use when making italian pizza or pasta (grated). I suggest getting the aged asiago though because it has a little more flavor to it. This is a very good brand for asiago cheese."
1,Kindle edition is next to unuseable,"I purchased the Kindle edition to this book and was very disappointed. The text itself is readable, but matrices and equation formatting is so bad that the book is unreadable. The matrices often will display interspersed or overlaid with text. Sub and superscripts do not render correctly. Bullet lists are not displayed correctly.I do not recommend this book at all in the Kindle edition."
3,Linear Algebra,"This text was used by the professor, however I found the notation used confusing and vague. The book was shipped well and good quality."
2,review,"Useful, definitely has information that you absolutely must know about the fashion industry. But it does not need to be purchased. Borrow it from the library--the book can be read in one sitting and offers general advice."
1,The first Motorolas I do not like,"Just when I thought Motorola was infallible. These radios are terrible. Totally unreliable. They stop functioning long before the batteries die. You try to key up to talk, but instead you are interupted with a beep and you find that you aren't transmitting. We learned the hard way on a trip to Baja. Also, they take the more expensive and harder to find AAA batteries instead of AA. There are many great choices by Motorola, but these aren't one of them!"
5,Microsoft Digital Image Suite 10.0,"This product is awesome, has several editing tools and is really easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone. The smart erase feature is great, if there's something in the background of a picture it easily and quickly removes it. Again awesome product!"
3,Photo Story,"I bought this digital suite for the one thing it does exceptionally well. No fuss - no muss, this software makes beautiful slide shows with narration or music. There is very little personalization, very little choice in how the slide show plays out, but the pans and zooms are nicely done anyway.Here's where the trick comes in -- it's advertised or somehow implied that the Photo Story can be burned onto a DVD to operate on most DVD players. Exactly what I wanted, but that doesn't seem to be the actual case. Unless I'm wrong (that DOES happen on occasion) the Photo Story only seems to burn onto video CDs. Makes for a short televised story, sadly.So that's the caveat. It's good software, easy to operate, burns digital files to CD or DVD for archiving and does this extra lovely thing that the Adobe Album doesn't do in the Photo Story. But only three stars for the DVD failure. Five stars if it's there and I've somehow missed it."
4,Great introductory book,"This book was helpful to me because Rabbi Gershom explained alternative theories of Jewish thought after death. It is introductory enough for people of non-Jewish heritage to understand, yet involves some intimately personal stories shared by regular people. Some of the stories are more detailed than others, but they provide insight into the lives of people who remember details about the Holocaust. It is great to have as a resource, as past-life recall stories are frequently from people of a Christian, Spiritual, or Agnostic background."
5,Can't fish Alaska without this book!,"Fishing Alaska's streams and rivers can be difficult. If you're not there when the salmon are, your just getting your line wet... you aren't fishing! This book will tell you when to fish, for what species, for every stream in Alaska. Plan your Alaska fishing trip, guided or unguided, by the salmon runs!"

1,It should include the bootleg,"This book could have been titled: ""Review of a Bootleg.""I would have enjoyed this book a LOT more if I had had the bootleg ""Rock and Roll Cowboy"" to listen to while reading it. Williams is a great writer, but he spent far too much time discussing this bootleg that the average joe can not get. Thus I ultimately found the book to be incredibly frustrating and ended up TRADING IT FOR THE BOOTLEG! There's some kind of justice in that."
3,Night Witches,"Night Witches is a pioneer and readable non-fiction book about Soviet airwomen in combat in World War II. However, it is bad journalism as it was written in a somewhat sensational manner and is full of petty mistakes, such as misspelled names, and airwomen assigned to wrong photo captions, ranks, appointments, and even regiments. The appellation ""Night Witches"" itself, coined by the enemy, was considered offensive by Soviet airwomen. Night Witches has been largely superseded by books written or edited by the following: Anne Noggle (A Dance with Death: Soviet Airwomen in World War II, 1994); Kazimiera J. Cottam (Women in Air War: The Eastern Front in World War II and Women in War and Resistance, 1997 and 1998); and a forthcoming book by Reina Pennington (Wings, Women and War: Soviet Women in Military Aviation in the Second World War, University Press of Kansas, 2001)."
3,Good Read,"While the historical accuracy may be in question, the book itself is very enjoyable and exciting to read. I wish the text had not ended with the war but gone on to discuss how the women re-adjusted to society and what they did after the war."
3,"Good, but it needs to be accompanied by much more information to get a true picture (a history teacher's review)","'Night Witches' is a history of Soviet women's fighter and bomber units in World War II. It is based on extensive interviews with the survivors. Myles has worked these interviews into a remarkably entertaining and informative read that is marred only by what the text is lacking: maps, more details about their planes and the planes of their enemies and other Soviet units, more detail about how the Soviets used these planes in conjunction with other units and an over-arching historical narrative to place these women in their historical context.My copy was published in 1990 and I was disappointed to find that it literally fell apart as I was reading it - the binding was very fragile and the pages fell out individually and in chunks."
2,"Bad journalism, confused and fictionalized.",This is a very poor source of information on an important topic. This book does little justice to an important part of history. Much better are the more recent interviews conducted by Anne Noggle (A Dance With Death) and the translations of Russian works on this topic by K. Jean Cottam (In the skies Above the Front).
5,Clip on watch,The watch is perfect for those at work that cannot wear a wrist watch nor keep a cell phone on them. Love the heavy duty canvas strap and clip and the fact that you can just look down and see the time. This watch would be perfect if it had a back light and a flip cover to prevent the face from cracking due to working in an industrial area. Will definitely buy another one of these.
3,LITTLE DISAPOINTED,"Tiger Woods 07 is a great game, unfortunitly it seems the disc was a little scratched and i get a problem evey once in a while, however it is playable and i do reccommend buying it."
2,kind of boring!,"I like sport game, but this one is the worst game I ever play. It's hard to control the ball or other stuffs."
2,Perfumed,I found this unpleasant to use because of the perfume. In future I would look for an unscented product of the same type.
2,"PRODUCT OK, MUST HAVE BEEN OLD","THE PRODUCT WAS STILL OK, BUT I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN OLD BOTTLE BECAUSE IT CRACKED AT THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE, I HAD TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER CONTAINER,"
1,You can harly here the ringer,"The Luc CP1929-14 Mechanical Extended ring timer is pure Junk. The timer works good, but you can hardly hear the ringer. Maybe this one is bad, The Best one is a Robert Shaw made by Lux and I cannot believe the difference. At this time I have cut my loss and looking for a real good one that I can Use. It is unfortunely that this product can get by the quality control department, but this is the USA."
3,QUALITY & VALUE,They do the job perfectly plus they come in a quality crock. A great value when you consider the very low price.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I was very hopeful that these would at least aid, in a noticeable way, in the moisturizing of my very dry heels. I did not simply put them on and wait for a ""miracle"". I used a foot file and pumice then put on the suggested cream and had the socks on for hours at a time. I did this consistently for about 2 weeks (4 to 5 times a week) and it did absolutely nothing. My heels have shown no change whatsoever. The only thing the socks are good for is after putting on a load of cream, the gel inside prevents it from seeping through the socks. That reason alone however is not worth the slightly expensive price."
5,Great product!,"This is a great help for sufferers of chronic heel pain. I have plantar faciitis, especially in my left heel. I have worn these to bed off and on for years to cushion the heel in bed at night. I also wear them under my socks at work-I walk all day on the job. They cushion the heel and help a lot. They are also not too hot on your feet at night-a bit help. I highly recommend this product."
4,love these,Works great by them selves but add a little a&d ointment and they are amazing. Wear these once a week now and they keep my heels beach ready.
2,Black & Decker Toaster Oven,"This toaster has one main and annoying problem that could have been so easily corrected at the factory. It toasts unevenly (referring to top and bottom sides of the bread). This would have been so easy to correct, simply by slightly changing the location of the groove that the tray rests in. I would have thought they would have tested this before producing millions of them. Another problem is there is a brushed aluminum trim panel on the top of the toaster that got scratched simply by placing a pan on it."
2,Not so good,"Pros: looks nice; big enough to toast four pieces at onceCons: doesn't work well: gets really hot on the outside glass (melts things that touch it); toast feature works sometimes and sometimes does not (cheap wiring?)Conclusion: I have had this toaster for about six monts and I regret buying it. I thought B&D; meant quality, but this thing clearly is poor quality."
2,buyer beware,i did like this toaster oven very much but 6 months after purchase ther upper element went out and it would cost almost as much as the toaster to repair it.
5,Great transformer,Perfect for powering our kotatsu heater from japan which we Purchased to replace 110v space heaters which had proven inadequate.
1,Waste of money,It only lasted 5 months and it got a hole on one of the seams. We tried to repair it with a bicycle inner tube repair kit but didn't work. We ended up buying a standard one and works great.
1,phhhh,this is a borng book and you can just look at pictures to find the answer so you dont have fun sloving the case and it is not a mystery just a story and not as goodd as other mk+ash books those are gooder
5,A Good Film for ANY Ballet Lover,I enjoyed this film. Its easy to understand. It has clips throughout of some of their original performances which are a treat to those of us who never got to see them live. I definately recomend this to all ballet lovers. Its any important piece of history that needs to be known.
1,Double Helix is a double cross to the reader,"Of all the medical/scientific mystery books that I have read, this was by far the least rewarding in terms of both quality of plot and competency and thoroughness of the author's research.While the unsophisticated and over-worn plot regarding human cloning for organ harvesting attempts to build, the reader is left with neither an exciting storyline nor an interesting or redeeming discussion of the actual science of cloning.The author conceals his pro-life/anti-science agenda until the last 25 pages. He also demonstrates a drammatic lack of understanding of what is actually happening in molecular research and of the high ethics and humane purposes of those involved in this area of investigation.I usually donate the books I have read but this one goes in the trash so no one else wastes their time."
5,This is about DANNY!!!!!,"This record and live at the Brewery Center were recorded the same year. Danny is HOT here and most definately the featured artist. Yes they are playing John Martyn's songs, but Danny really stretches like he used to in the Pentagle days (his late sixties and early seventies prog-folk band). The recording tech could have been better, but get this to here a master acoustic bass artist supreme! Awesome spin!"
1,a joke,"This is a guide to what most people would consider common sense. This book does a poor job of correctly representing the academic side of Ohio State. Most of it is dedicated to social aspects. If you would like to get a feel for what Ohio State is like, visit it. Do not rely on somoeones elses opinion to make such an important choice."
1,Burg recites from other authorities,A sophomoric recital of others ideas. Burg spends more ink in the table of contents and endless reprinting of the title of the very book in your hands than in initiating any new thoughts/approaches on communicating.A rip off!
1,the art of george quaintance/vertag,"Fortunatly I have in my personal collection, many original Qauimtance art pieces from the fourties and fifties that I was smart enough to acquire while in my teens and early twenties. He was probably the most recognized gay artist of the time and his works are well sought after even today. But I must complain that this poor excuse of a tribute to his artistry is a gross waste of paper, time and energy, and your money if you are comptenplating purchasing it....Damn shame....."
4,Geat Orchestra & Dancers,A good DVD with great music and dancing. However it would have been better to concentrate on all russian music. Camera work was not the highest & sharpest quality rather more an amateurish effort. Sound recording quality also not absolutely stellar. Nonetheless a nice DVD to have.
5,"Great Series, but do NOT pay hundreds of dollars for it","Buy this insteadLiberty's Kids: Complete Series.The complete series, but at a much better price!"
2,Not as Cheap as Earlier Editon,"Sorry to disagree with all those glowing stars, but I think the seventh edition is inferior to my old well-loved, well-worn earlier one. Maybe Ms. Gustafson's opinion of what is cheap has changed, but mine hasn't. The number of three-star establishments predominates, with a new emphasis on splurging. This is not why I buy this kind of guide.I also can't warm up to the author's new self-congratulatory tone she has developed. And what's the deal with belaboring how many miles were walked and how much rain was slogged through to bring the lucky reader only the best information?I've changed my allegiance to Frommer and Steves. These guys know how to talk travel without pretension."
5,Perfect,Everything about this purchase went perfectly smooth.The Book arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition. The price was about 1/2 that of others that were used while this was new.Not much else to say as this is a Manual and it IS a Haynes Manual which pretty much assures that it is the detail and quality that one might want for such a manual.
2,Hard Case - Poor workmanship,"I ordered this case for my Alvarez Yairi guitar.The case is a hard case with covering of heavy tan tarp texture. My first impression was not up to the expectations that I had anticipated. The stitching on the guitar case is terrible. The lid was fine but the bottom had almost every other stitch loose and baggy. The insides are glued to the edges, so with care I'm trying to remove the insides to access the case which I hope allows me to hand pull the threads inside the case and then glue them taut. You would think that quality control would have put this one back for remake. It is usable but not the general quality I expect from the products I purchase from Amazon."
1,Alvarez should not have their name on this product....,"This case was poorly put together. It didn't close correctly, the latches didn't match up, and there was a machine hole on the hinge side where a mistake had been made when it was manufactured. It was very disappointing to see that a company who produces such nice instruments would actually put their name on this case. I ordered a second one from another vendor to see if the quality was any different. It was NOT. That one actually had a cut in the trim and the fabric covering wasn't attached on part of the front of the case. It also did not close well, although it was better than the first case in this regard. I would not recommend this case to anyone."
2,I guess I need a step by step...,I was expecting a super easy way to learn astrology. Maybe I need a 'for dummies' book. I didn't even finish reading this because I thought it jumped around & the reader was supposed to put it all together themselves.
4,A solid compilation,"Following in the footsteps of THIS IS CINERAMA, this compilation of radio sessions and live performances may not be a good introduction to Gedge & Co. but makes for a nice alternative listening experience to the studio albums. The first session is a tad shaky, but things get better rapidly; ""146 Degrees"" and the amazing ""Reel 2, Dialogue 2"" (their most underrated B-side) are highlights, as is their lively cover of the Turtles' ""Elenore."" Audio quality is very good."
1,Still not recieved,I still have not recieved product and you want me to review the product. I might if I ever recieve the product
4,vinyl boat buoy,Purchased 15 bouys for our private marina. They seem to be fine. Only problem was one had a factory flaw blemish & leaked so is being replaced for no charge.
5,Wow! What a ball you'll have,This ball was flat and yellow until I inflated it. Then it was round and yellow and bounced great. The kids liked it just fine until it went missing. Hopefully being yellow we'll find it soon.
2,"Dated, routine, pulpy Cold War SF adventure. 1.6 stars","This dated, routine, pulpy SF adventure relates the discovery of an ancient ruined spaceport on the Moon. A crack linguistic team has a surprisingly easy time translating the 'alien' language -- it's similar to Sumerian. Shortly afterwards, an exploration team is racing towards Altair, the home of the Vanryn, in a quickly-reproduced Vanryn starship. Oh, and those Vanryn turn out to be regular homo saps, defeated by the the powerful, shadowy Llorn way back when....The SF Encyclopedia rates this as Hamilton's best novel, which is why I hunted down a copy. I found it pretty bad: clicheed, predictable, overwrought and pulpy. At least it's short. I don't think I'd have much liked it in the 60's, either. Not recommended.Happy reading (something else!),Peter D. Tillman"
4,A Good Sampling of the Music,"I had bought this movie in VCR format many years ago and missed being able to see it from time to time. This still provides a good look into the rural atmosphere of the mid-20th century, as well as the songs for which Hank Williams was known. It is a sad movie, but probably accurate."
3,Good story,"The story line is good, Hank songs very enjoyable. I was disappointed in the video quality. This was obviously not an upscale professional production..."
1,Disappointing,MMmmmmmm not what I had expected...I expected some original footage of Hank but of course this did not happen. The main weakness was the singing...not very good...would have been much better if Hank SR. or Hank Jr had done the singing and also got another actor who looked and sounded more like Hank. Others seem to have liked this ....but not me!! A lot of other reviewers seem to have liked it....we must be on different planets!! It was aweful!!
1,Awful,"This was the worst DVD movie I have bought. This guy is absolutely stupid and ungly to boot. Nothing like Hank Williams at all. I wasted my money on this DVD, it is a insult to the Great Hank Williams. I threw mine in the trash, i couldn't even watch it all the way through."
4,So funky,"So much like James Brown it's eerie ... if you want something other than rap to move your party, this is it, man ... some titles so classic they're funny, from ""Funky Train"" to ""[Santa's got a] Bag of Soul."""

1,Overpriced junk!,"This is not a guitar. It is a toy. The intonation is completely out. The tailpiece ripped out of the body after tuning it a few times. And the neck is not scaled properly. The octave harmonic (which should be located directly above the 12th fret) is located between the 13th and 14th frets! To top it all off, the body came cracked. I was looking for an inexpensive travel guitar. I should have known better because I am a professional guitarist. You get what you pay for. Buyer beware!"
1,DVD's that don't play on Australian players,"I purchased to box sets of DVD's (both for gifts) and when I treid one of the DVD's out to make sure they were ok they did not play and the player said to ""check your area"". To say that I am bitterly dissappointed would be an understatement!! Not only was it a complete waste of money but also a sad reflection on Amazon for not notifying the purchaser of the requirements needed to use the product. Poor Poor Poor"
4,An Invaluable Handbook,"Solidly grounded in scientific research, Dr. Auf der Heide created a one-of-a-kind handbook for emergency responders and emergency managers. A real loss to the community that it went out of print."
5,amazing energy,"I loved L'Italiano and Ti Amo, but I had no idea this album would be so great. I love club music, and I have been blasting Godfather theme and Tarrantella in my headphones ever since I bought this album. I can't wait to hear these tracks out in a club. But what's great about this album is that my wife loves it also. She loves Faithfull, and the track with Reina. I think I saw Angelo Venuto sing at a wedding a few years ago. If that was him, I'm really proud of this guy. He has blown up. I usually just buy compilations, but this is the first album from an artist that I will be keeping in my car cd play for many months to come."
5,ROOSTER COGBURN,"WAYNE AND HEPBURN....GREAT COMBO IN THIS MOVIE, GREAT STORY, ALOT OF ACTION AND SOME FUNNY PARTS, MISS HEPBURN AS ALWAYS IS GREAT AND THIS IS A DIFFERANT WAYNE LIKE IN """" TRUE GRIT """" WAYNE IS THE MAN. DON'T MISS ADDING THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION."
3,"Get Real, People","Even TV Guide's entry on this movie calls it ""talky"". And, yes, there ARE some good lines between the Duke and Kate Hepburn but they cannot carry the plot. And when I saw that helmet-haired ""screenwriter"" Martha Hyer had Hepburn's brother killed AND put them in a boat together (both a la ""The African Queen"", a classic with Hepburn and Bogart), I was embarrassed for them both. Hepburn has been quoted as saying she really liked Wayne but didn't care for the movie. Ditto, I'm sure. This is NOT a ""screwball"" movie. And to correct both posters regarding Robert Duvall in the original Rooster Cogburn movie, ""True Grit"", that was not his first movie role. He was in a silent role in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in 1962 and in Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt"" as a cabdriver in or about 1968."
3,"Dull plot, wasted superstars","What a tragedy that Hollywood was able to unite two of the powerhouse superstars of cinema in one movie, but then saddle them with a plodding, boring and utterly pedestrian script. The chemistry between Wayne and Kate Hepburn is palpable and their scenes together are a joy to watch. But there are too few of such scenes to justify repeated viewings or to classify this movie as anything but average and a spent opportunity.Hepburn is miscast as a crotchety, virginal spinster who pines in her heart for the Duke, but is too repressed to act on her instincts. The Duke's reprisal of Rooster Cogburn is interesting, and he delivers an excellent performance, but the script fails him time and again. Ultimately it's frustrating to watch two great stars wallow in this banal plot. One interesting element in the DVD version is the gorgeous Rogue river scenery which seems to come to life in this format."
5,Can't wait to buy this cd,"I love Maureen McGovern and can't wait to hear this album. She has one of the most beautiful voices. I'm anxious to listen to her sing "" Where Do You Start?"". She sang it recently for a deeply touching scene on ""General Hospital"" as Luke and Laura signed their divorce papers. She had all of us GH fans in tears as she sang. And ""How Do You Keep The Music Playing"" ( ""The Music Never Ends"")..wow...that ought to be powerful also!"
4,This is great!!!!!,"Since propane and charcoal grills were banned in my apartment complex, I just had to get one of these!!!! It is great and easy to clean up."
1,previous foreman grill i owned was way better,"Much more lightweight than previous one I owned, Better Foreman grill at Costco for same price."
5,Best non gas/charcoal grill I have used.,"I have a condo that doesn't allow anything but electric. If you are in the same boat this is the grill to buy. Keeps food very moist and makes it nearly impossible to overcook the food. Tastes great, easy to use, and easy (for the most part) to clean. I would say a gas or charcoal grill would still beat this thing but for the price and convenience you can be sure this will do the job."
1,I was very unhappy,"I received this item with no return address, no packing slip, nothing except the item was in the package. I was not pleased with the item so I sent 2 e-mail asking the company how to send it back and received no reply, so I am just stuck with it still in the package."
2,Velcro grips coming apart after a couple of months,"I bought the Yakgrips velcro version for paddling several times per week on Lady Bird Lake in Austin (using a one-piece paddle). They worked fine for the first few weeks, but now, about 6 weeks later, the stitching holding the velcro strip in place has disintegrated. Although I found them really comfortable at first, I can't recommend them and I'll be looking for a more durable replacement."
5,Love these shoes.,"These shoes are wonderful. I am a nurse and work 12 1/2 hr. shifts. My feet feel good even after that length of time. They look great with my uniforms. I have bought several pairs. They don't seem to breakdown as tennis shoes do. I am still wearing a pair that I have well over a year. Tennis shoes usually wear out after 6 month and my calves would kill me, but not these shoes."
2,Over Rated,I was weary about buying this CD because it was on Drive-Thru and I haven't liked anything they've put out. I heard the 30 second sound clips from amazon and thought it sounded different from all this pop-punk pop-emo crud that's gotten really big in the last year and it was all acoustic. I was very dissapointed by this. Now I know why all those pop-emo kids all love this. It sounds exactly like everything else. This songs sound just like Jimmy Eat World and the Get Up Kids. Not to mention that they don't sound like were written for an acoustic guitar. I can't see why this CD brought out any strong emotional response in anybody. I guess the key to emotional songs is to sing really high about girls. If you like acoustic songs I think you should check out Bright Eyes or Pedro the Lion.
1,... for wanna be emo kids,"Wow... All i can say is that i hope when this guy is talking about ""love"" he is really revealing the plan for his OWN SUICIDE. If you want good acoustic emo, check out pedro or bright eyes, otherwise check out mineral, moss icon or rites of spring."
5,"Chris Carrabba - sexy, talented, and just a cool kid",Chris has this amazing voice. I had heard of DC before I really gave them a chance. But one day I was bored and downloaded some songs and I could not stop listening to him. His music is captivating. His acoustic skills blew me away. I give this CD and Swiss Army Romance a 5-star rating. And Chris... I LOVE YOU! (Just went to his show on Wednesday!)
4,"Short, effective review","This is a good, short book that will leave the reader satisfied, but also wanting some more. Short books often have the merit of being concise and accessible, but often not having the full details one would wish for. In a small space, David Holmes makes a convincing case that the Founding Fathers were in fact mostly Deists who were friendly to Christianity, but favored reason and abstract moral principle above miracles and metaphysical beliefs. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Founding Fathers or the guiding religious principles that drove them. Holmes book will illuminate much, but the curious reader will go further."
4,A time foreign to us indeed,"After reading the Age of Reason I read this book to confirm my belief that this country was not founded upon Christianity. Overall I was right, but I did not have the feel of the Founding Fathers' beliefs until reading it and some of it I did not expect. America was something new; sects of all kinds were present and tolerated. They did not agree with each other's religious beliefs but that did not matter. Religion was a personal thing. This may have been a country founded on deism by deists but it is for everyone.Holmes gives a informative overview but it feels like he is leaving a few details out. I would have like to see a study of how their morals affected their actions and policy. I also noticed some typos that should not have been overlooked. Clearly, this books should have been edited better. But I suppose its what you get from pop history."
2,Disappointing,A disappointment. The product I received leaks and it is hard to roll up and unwind the hose. Go with an automatic hose rewinder (the water pressure rewinds the hose for you) instead. Definitely worth the extra money.
1,Wish I had purchased better designed hose reel cart,"I've have used hose reel carts for many years. I needed an additional cart. After spending time reviewing my opinions I selected the Suncast SHA150B. It was very easy to setup. Unfortunately, I do not like the position and length of the hand crank. It's difficult to reel in a hose on a grass surface. I even have had problems reeling an empty 100 ft hose that I placed on my concrete driveway.This is the first purchase from Amazon.com that I have rated so low."
2,Beware - poor fidelity,"Not sure what source or actual encoding method was used for these mp3s - the encoding bit rate wound up being around 110K or so for the first song, but even with higher bit rates in the rest of the songs, the quality is not quite what I'd expect. It's really a shame, this is a great recording of Coltrane and Dolphy, but you would be much better served with getting the album for 9.99"
1,Disappointed,Was seriously considering this purchase and although not an expensive one I looked at the item at Bed Bath and Beyond. The sliding handles does not work well and was somewhat difficult to adjust. Would not recommend this purchase.
4,Cherished Hymns by Gaither,Hymns ware very wll presented and sung. I have a few of the Gaither CD's and would not part with them. I have quite a few of CD's christian and gospel music and have to say that the majority of the Gaither CD's are the best.
5,Loved it,Saw this show on television and ordered it. I was not dissappointed with the CD at all. I would recommend it .
3,Fun,"This is a fun product to play with you friends and I assume will help customers with a disibility. But it is not secure, slow and comes off track very easily if bumped. But for the price, it's not bad."
5,The Best Can Opener Ever!!,"This is truly the best can opener I have ever owned. Makes a simple process what it should be, simple and easy. It is heavy and durable, but comfortable. Opens cans with almost no effort. I liked it so much I ordered five more as gifts."
3,The book was Okay!,"The book was great when you needed general info, but it left out the best equipment which I really wanted. The way they describe the games story though makes it seem as if there is only one way to go through the game."
2,Okay if you really need the help...,"I do not own this book but I saw it at a friend's house. It is useless unless you are really desperate for some help, which should not happen. It is always better to explore the game on your own! Using guides such as this ruin the game fun and the challenges Square wanted to put you through."
2,Demasiado fácil,"Si Santana decía que el rock es una piscina y el jazz el mar, este disco es una bañera. Uno de los misterios del mundo es que a alguien le gusten los temas de Andrés, sobre todo porque no hay originalidad, se entiende muy mala leche de fondo en las letras (muy argentino)y además sus producciones no aportan nunca nada nuevo. Pero si han premiado a otros porteños con tan poco talento como él, por ej. a Fito y lanzado también a Coti, debe ser que el mercado está sordo y desorientado. Prefiero a Charly, Gieco, Spinetta, Moris..."
5,rough tote review,"They are rugged and last a long time. I wish they would offer more colors, but I understand why they don't."
1,De Lempicka (Basic Art),"I have long been a fan of Taschen art books, and that's why I was so surprised by how terrible this book is! The quality of the reproductions is fairly bad (many of the colors are dulled), but what's worse is that the author basically used one source (Passion by Design) for his autobiography of Tamara de Lempicka. Instead of doing his own biographical research, he basically copied whole paragraphs from Passion by Design, shuffled a few words around, and presented it as his own information. Frankly, I'm surprised no one has hauled him into court for plagarism. So if you're looking for a good book about Tamara de Lempicka, don't look here! You should, however, check out Passion by Design by Kizette de Lempicka-Foxhall (the artist's daughter). It has excellent color reproductions of the artist's work, as well as one of the most fascinating, well-written, and comprehensive artist biographies I have ever read."
2,Great while it lasted!,"We bought this toaster oven after our old one died after many years. It lit up like the sun but toasted fast and we used it several times a week. We learned to deal with the lack of temperature settings and the constant red light so that you never knew if it was on or off, but after 16 months, the top heating element blew out, 4 months after the manufacturer's warranty period. Reading the other reviews, I guess we were lucky to have it work so long although the customer service person I spoke to on the phone said it should not have stopped working so soon. When you spend that much money on an appliance, you expect it to last years, not months. We loved it and now we will avoid all Toastmaster products. A great beginning that ended in bitterness."
2,disappointed,"No preheat required. This was the reason I decided on this toaster oven. Fired the unit up at home before I brought it into work. Turned her on and whammo instant heat. I was looking forward to using it the following day. Stayed out late last night too many drinks - not used to that any more. So my plans of cooking a salmon steak turned into a corn dog. Put the dog in the oven that is when I noticed there is no temperature control. There are presets for bakery, potato, broil, etc. But no way to adjust like a regular temperatur control. Four minutes later my dog is black. Will look at directions when I get home - probably return tonight."
3,Comment on reviewer No. 1,"The viewer from Pittsburgh, PA, is completely wrong. First, it is not certain if Lizzie commited the murders, second, she was not convicted, but acquitted. I doubt very much that he has seen the video. Oh, it's a good video, the information in it is well-researched, and it makes your mouth water for more details and facts from her life."
5,Another bird book,"Was nostalgic about California and remembering the flora and fauna in my old Suburban Sactown neighborhood. Just another reason left coast is the best coast. 38.5 Californians can't be wrong. (I now live in Baltimurder, MD)Plus, those little hovering Hummers are a hoot. Book shows that well."
2,I like your new stuff better than your old stuff,"do you like the latest from emiliana torrini? then don't buy this! rather dated 90's sounding overproduced dance tracks with rather average lyrics. there are a couple of tracks that have withstood the test of time and fashion, but most of this was unbearable to listen to, having recently been enchanted by the last album, and loving fisherman so much. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,A pop format with an Intelligent musician behind it,"you can tell that Emiliana is striving to become the next female singer to break onto the stage, following the recent break-out entrances by other solo female singers. The album is formatted with pop-length songs that carry an indisputable resemblance to songs written by other distraught teenage musicians. But Emiliana is different....her entracing voiccec can transport you to other worlds. If you'd like to try a new and refreshing voice, buy this CD"
2,Re: Parmesan,"In regard to a previous reviewer's comments, ""parmesan"" is not legally protected. It is often used for cheeses that are crafted to resemble ""Parmigiano-Reggiano."" Parmigiano-Reggiano, however, is a protected designation of origin, and thus, in Italy, adheres to specific standards per court decree.However. This cheese is not very good on its own. It can do the job when combined with other ingredients. This is the only parmesan or Parmigiano the Polish supermarket near me carries, so I use it in a pinch. But I would never recommend it as part of a cheese plate."
1,horrible,"Every once in a while I'll buy an album as a total chance shot. I did this because I liked a handful of 'Triumph' songs. Nothing personal against Rik but this is quite possibly the worst album I have ever purchased. After hearing the first few seconds on the first song I was like, ""ewwww"". At the half way point of the 2nd song I fast forwarded to the third. 30 seconds into this song I was offended at how bad this CD was. I listened to the first minute of every song and only made it to the end of 2 or 3 songs. I think the 8th track was the one I thought passed as decent. But man, this is some horrible stuff."
1,Not Recommended,Tried the product but it did not work for me. I cannot recommend it. Spend your money elsewhere.
5,Weber Genesis Gold C Gas Grill,"I purchased a Weber Grill through Amazom.Com. Zero problems was easy to put together, was shipped in a prompt time, shipper called and asked me what time to be at my house, they were very good, even put it on my deck for me. Love the grill. Much faster than old Ducane grill."
5,68 Extra Fat and 12 Dwarf...,"This movie has always held a special place in my heart, and there is no better movie to take with you on a road trip than this here (although there are very few watching any HDDVD's in a moving vehicle, I'm sure). Having owned this on VHS and DVD, I thought it might be silly to repurchase this again. How much improvement could be made? Amazingly, this copy is wonderful. The picture and colors are crisp as can be, the sound of the Trans Am peeling out is uncanny, and I have never enjoyed this movie better. The special features (which I believe may be holdovers from the special edition) are worth watching too. Get this while they still have some to sell, it is worth it!"
5,Gleason made this movie really shine,"There are lots of great things about this movie. Sally Field is irresistably cute, Burt Reynolds is charming, Jerry Reed and his dog are great sidekicks....but Sheriff Buford T. Justice and his boy bring a large amount of the laughs. I may be a little bit biased as Jackie Gleason is one of my favorite entertainers of all time, but he was great as the sheriff. Its a shame there were no more similar (or even different) roles like this for him. He was a great actor and had a talent for making people laugh."
3,"LIGHTWEIGHT COMEDY, BUT APPEALING STARS MAKE IT FUN!","I had not seen this film in many years and I did see this in a theater when it was released. Burt Reynolds is a likeable guy and it's his charisma and his fellow cast members' Gleason, Field and Reed that make this comedy so enjoyable. The thread bare plot is just an excuse for ""peel outs"" and the usual car wrecks that these films were known for back in the 70's.If you grew up with it you probably love it, but if your viewing this film for the first time it might not seem as great as it's reputation.I am reviewing the two disc pursuit pack version of this film that includes the two sequels. I do not know anything about the special edition release of this film, but from what I've heard it's not very special."
3,they don't make road movies like this anymore,"Like many,I grew up with this movie & it has to be the best road movie of all time, others have tried to duplicate it(Thelma&Louise,Midnight Run), but none have had the intensity that this one has, I seriously doubt a film like this would be made today, It is not very politically correct to say the least, & is dated, but hey, this was 1977, a time when Hollywood WAS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE CHANCES, Burt Reynolds & Sally Field(boy, was she hot then)had great chemistry & was cast perfectly & who could ever forget Jackie Gleason's obsession with capturing the Bandit, Jerry Reed also has great one-liners, & that TRANS-AM, man I haven't seen a car like it since, It must have been the only one of its kind, other Trans-am's had a different front-end, who didn't want to be the Bandit in 1977, the 2nd biggest film behind STAR WARS in 1977, with a real southern country feel to it, highly recommended"
4,So what happened to the R-Rated version?,"I absolutly love this movie, but I can't give it 5 stars until someone digs out the ""Original"" R-Rated version of this classic! I remember when this movie was first released with a R rating and ran 2 hours long. After the movie took off, it was edited to 96 minutes and a PG rating so kids could see the film. At least 15 to 20 minutes of R Rated footage exist somewhere in the vaults of Universal studios. Am I the only one that wants the uncut version? I sure hope not."
4,Pretty good but.....,These are great for frying eggs. My husband was amazed that they did not melt into a puddle while making his sunny side up breakfast. I have to agree with the writer who thought the notch on the handle to be uncomfortable. It kinda digs into your hand and these will discolor in chili or spaghetti sauce. Just a warning. Overall they are good but if you can stretch to buy the Le Crueset then spend the extra $$.
4,Good Pencils,"These pencils are great for 5 or 6 year olds. I thought they'd be good for my three year old granddaughter to color, but they're much too long for a pre-schooler to use. I'll just save them. They arrive quickly and were in perfect condition."
4,Just as entertaining the second time around!,"This was the first of P.T.'s books that I read that I found in a bag of second-hand books. I was immediately drawn to the story because I lived near Roanoke and Blacksburg, VA many years ago, when the ""Ramsey Arsenal"" was still open. From ""Hunting Season"" I learned about ""sweepers"" and other specially trained agents and the technology that is available to them as well as the difficult politics of ""staying alive"" as a Fed (or ex-Fed).Most of the book takes place in and around the old arsenal and is well described. The underground syphon chamber that was used to flush away bad batches of toxic chemicals was interesting but the various scenarios surrounding it were a bit much as was the constant vehicle switching. But the story is great, and I am reading it for the second time, after 9/11. This book has it all-FBI, CIA, ATF, mountain men, and all the ""toys"" Kreiss uses that makes a gun unecessary."
4,biker chick jersey review,I do like the jersey however it definetly runs small... i read this in a review so i ordered a size larger a LARGE and i wish i had an X-Large..i wish it were a little longer.. but i like it
2,Needs updating-- Book too old,"I do not believe I received the latest edition of the book. I received the Fourth Edition. Some of the information in the book was outdated. There was no mention of Oyster Cards which cost 11 pounds and last for a week giving riders unlimited rides on the buses and underground trains.Ifyou are 65 and over, you can get a Senior Citizen Card which gives one totally free rides in London. Ms. Gustavson should look into these items.Some of the places don ot exist and some of the prices were outdated."
3,Works but not a miracle,"These do reduce my snoring and help me sleep a bit better. They are better than nothing at all but I wouldn't say they greatly reduce my snoring - just take the edge off of it.The adhesive can be a bit annoying to pull off in the morning and having my nasal passages pulled at gives me a bit of a headache (I would compare it to having one of those eye masks on for sleeping - I could never wear those because they give me too much of a headache).Because of the hassle, I wear these only when I know I'm probably going to snore loudly at night (I'm feeling sick, my allergies are acting up, I'm dead tired... ironically this is probably about 50% of the time).Bottom line, I would buy them again (especially with subscribe and save) but they are not a miracle product and you'll be disappointed if you expect this to stop your snoring all together."
3,noble misfire,"With The Jonah, James Herbert has taken a big step forward from his previous work, though this is not saying that the novel is a classic, by any means. The premise of the novel is intriguing-- a decent cop who, through no fault of his own, brings misfortune to those around him. I was hoping for some deep exploration into philosophy or religion, but was sorely disappointed when, instead, it turned into a routine cop story (albeit a rather decent one) and then a disaster story (!!). Better writing and unexpected twists and turns made this an enjoyable read, but it lacked the profound exploration into the man's situation that I was looking for."
2,Book is a slight bit westernized.,"I would say if you are one of the Westernized standard citizens, read this book,... you might like it as much as Disney's[Fantasia]. If you are seriously looking for useful information, seek elsewhere... Thank you for the time."
3,Book Description from back cover,"To save her barony from ruin, Madeleine de la Haute Vironge must wed one of a trio of lords offered by King William. A shocking twist of fate impels the convent-bred beauty into the arms of the most dangerous of the three-a magnificent, exciting stranger Madeleine desires...but also fears.Torn between familial loyalties and devotion to his king, handsome Aimery de Gaillard prowls the forest as the Golden Hart, devoted to helping the common English folk. But the beautiful young heiress he is honor bound to marry suspects his secret, threatening his cause and his life. Yet his noble heart, hardened by mistrust, aches with passion for Madeline's sensuous innocence-entreating the daring outlaw to surrender to the glory, the rapture...and the peril of love."
5,Enthralling performances...,"I love all that is English, when it comes to history, and this is the icing on the cake. Helen Mirren gives an outstanding performance as Queen Elizabeth, the later years. She ""feels"" the part and ""lives"" the part. Adding personality to a much misunderstood royal ruler. Even going so far as to play pinch and giggle with the younger Robert. You can see the pained emotions on her face when she is forced to make a choice between love and her throne. But her heart belongs to England so she lives out the remainder of her life as a woman without love or family."
5,Elizabeth I,This is an excellent movie. I really enjoyed it. The Elizabethan period is one of my favorits.
5,Elizabeth I,Great performances. Great costuming. My one complaint is that liberty was taken with history. Robert Dudley did not die in her arms.
4,"Elisabeth I, two-part movie","Helen Mirren was outstanding. Part one was a very different interpretation of the time period compared to the recently released ""Elisabeth - the golden age."" Just another example of how differently history can be interpreted! The cast was excellent, wardrobe and scenery made the movie very believable."
2,A Let Down,"i was hoping to expand on bread machine recipes from the booklet that came with my mahine. This book has tons of recipes, but they're all pretty much the same, just switches flavors. Imagine any kind of fruit and nut combo bread, and they put it in there.I was hoping for more variety as far as type o fbreads and dough. Plus they have alot of sourdough recipes, which takes three days to make sourdough, somethinig I'm not inclined to do. It was kind of a disappoinment. i did try the banana bread recipe, but it came out like reguar white bread with a banana flavor-not very good."
1,Buy another book,"Several of the recipes have failed miserably, including the recipe for pizza bread. Just doesn't mix properly and I have a top of the line ""Zo"" bread machine. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."
3,Iron Palm Follow Up,"Brian suggest you study his first book before even reading this book. This book starts with the instructions on how to make Dit Da Jow. Techniques on how to increase power, what parts of the body are most valuable to strike and how to protect yourself using Iron Palm techniques."
1,Headed for the Landfill,"This is the worst kind of breakable plastic junk you can take home. Grains of fertilizer will jam the whirligig mechanism, and if you force it a bit,you'll twist the crank handle right off. Our landfills are overflowing, and this item is one of the reasons."
1,Don't waste your money,If you need to spread grass seed this will work well. If you are intending to use it for spreading fertilizer you are in for major headaches. The poorly designed thing binds up because fertilizer bits creep into the plastic gears and make it very hard to crank not crankable at all. Of course it is worthless as a tool when that happens. I had one that was made in the 1960's and made by the same company. It lasted over 18 years with just seasonal applications and kept indoors when not in use.
1,Works Lousy - It Jams,"I had an old Handygreen II spreader that I bought in 2000. It worked great. Bought a new one at Lowe's in mid March 2010. The first time I used it, it repeatedly jammed so that the handle wouldn't turn. I think the fertlizer gets caught below the whirlybird device and jams it. The old version never jammed. Maybe the Scotts company just wants you to use Scotts fertilizer which has really small particles. I was using a different brand which had the little pellets. In any case, don't buy this one....you'll just end up returning it!"
1,Disapointed,I live in Argentina. I bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa. The watch doesn't work and I can't change it or sent it back to usa.
1,Worst ever,"These are hands down the worst pair of workout boxers I have ever bought. I thought they were going to be a better version of under armor given the other reviews, but they are terrible. The sag in all the wrong places, refuse to hold you business in place and sit akwardly. I WOULD RETURN THEM IF I COULD"
4,"great, little expensive","this is a good product, maybe just a tad expensive but cool productl and i like this product and recommend"
5,Awesome undies!!,"you really don't know your wearing them, extremely comfy, they don't ride up your thigh and stay in place. I will be buying several more."
4,Good but not perfect,Good design but fit is kinda loose. could be a little more elastic or just needs to be more accurate sizing such as number size instead of letter size. Runs large so I will have to size down on next pair
3,Comfy but expensive and pilly,"These are very lightweight, and are just as fast-drying as described. The texture is nice, they aren't too slick or slippery, and are not at all clingy. I can't decide if they're really worth the price, but ExOfficio clothing is generally on the pricier side, but is of reasonably high quality. I have found that these have pilled up especially when worn with cotton shorts or pants over top."
4,Comfy with give in the seat!,"These were purchased for a gift and from what I understand they worked out great as they weren't too loose or baggy,had some give in the seat and crotch.And more importantly, some aeration as not to have them be too hot during a strenuous aerobic workout.I would buy more if the occasion arose."
4,"Good, but funky odor","These are incredibly comfortable, in all actuality they are amazing, however even with washing them, there is a funky odor that they give off. Its not a b-o odor, just something odd. Its the only item in the load of laundry that has this smell."
2,Exofico briefs and Ts,"No lighter than other brands underwear and grossly overpriced for ""made in China"". Returned and will continueto use my Cabelas sport undwear which was made in good old US of A."
2,Great material but fit is wrong,I really like the material these are made of but the fit leaves a lot to be desired. Namely the inseam is too long. What I mean is that if you want a snug fit with any kind of support then you either have to pull it up way above your belly button (who does that?) or you must fold the elastic band over on itself. Do not recommend unless you are over 70 years old.
5,Better than sliced Bread!,"Excellent product- greatest thing since sliced bread, actually, better since I haven't used sliced bread as drawers...Extremely comfortable, washable, breathe in hot weather, never bind up. Gotta go for now, off to ordere some more of these.Highly reccomend."
5,best undergarment for travel,"This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees. Considering their positive comments of this product, I would say this is by far the best undergarment you could purchase for travelers. They are wearing them on a daily basis now as well - one to wear, one to launder."
4,"Literally said ""wow"" when I put these on","These are fantastic underwear. The material is somewhat similar to workout clothes, very comfortable and airy. They also offer great support.I read another review that said the seam is right on the buttocks and somewhat uncomfortable to sit in after a while - the seam is indeed on the buttocks, but it is so small I don't even notice it at all.The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars is because of the ""Made in China"" label. =("
4,At first annoyed,"I will admit that it tends to twist and flop on my wrist a little more than I like, but it's attractiveness, especially paired with a silver jewel bracelet, makes it the perfect piece for those days when you want to look a little nicer. I enjoy wearing it, and especially because it's one of few dressier watches with indiglo, which is very handy in dark places when you just know you have to be somewhere else."
3,Yoruba,"Yoruba Sessions is a remix project by Osunlade on the always-solid K7 label. It features dancey vocal songs remixed.The cd reminds me of Victor Davies' self-titled record, which is highly recommended. Osunlade has good upbeat beats galore. It features an almost a Brazilian/electronica flavor to it.It's overall good stuff that'll make you happy when you pop it in the cd player."
5,I thought I was going crazy,"I was on every anti-depressant on the market. None seemed to work. When I was on Prozac and lithium I found that I grew more depressed. I couldn't eat, sleep, I withdrew from my friends and family. I haven't taken an antidepressant in two years and I feel great. I used to have suicidal thoughts every day but now that I am off Prozac I feel 100% better. Reading this book has helped me realize that the way to cure clinical depression is not to resort to antidepressants. They just aren't worth it!! Reading the other book reviews and this book made me aware that I was not the only one who was getting worse while on ""anti-depressants"". Thank you for the great info.!!"
2,a scolding tone!,"This would have been more convincing (and more entertaining to read) if the author had not seemed to be so personally emotional about the issue. Legitamite concerns about the drug are found side by side with histrionic, non-scientific arguments against it. I am a biased reader because Prozac has DRAMATICALLY changed my life for the better. I no longer cry easily. I almost never fight with my husband now because my 'control freak' tendencies are gone. I no longer have nightmares. This book should take experiences like mine into account instead of pretending they don't exist."
4,Pool Party Pleaser,This is a great CD for those warm sunny pool parties down here in south florida. Get the Blender and the party people together because these grooves transmit the vibes for a sultry smooth afternoon! A must for a friends get together!
5,Just a really good book.,"Someone in a coffee shop recommended NINTH SQUARE. I was going on vacation, so I gave it a shot. Read it on the beach in two days. The pacing is fast, the sarcasm borders on deadly at times. (This is not a book for extremely religious people.) And despite the subject matter (internet hookers), the women in the book are strong, intelligent and sexy. Completely entertaining. What more could I want from a thriller?"
4,All the information to see in one place,An engaging collection of the many incarnations of the Man of Tomorrow. It is good to see all of the different versions together and compare them. I was suprised to see that Gene Simmons had an opinion of Superman and I appreciated hearing it.A good resource for any Superman fan. If we could all try to be like Superman and just try to help one another this world would be a better place to live .
5,Talented lady ~ ~ ~ Horrible romcom!,"Whitney, you have heart, talent and guts. This show, however, is not worthy of you. It's cringe-inducingly bad. You deserve better. Stop trusting the freaks in Hollyweird and start trusting yourself. You're at your best when you reach out to your audience with the truth."
2,copy,"Whitney Pilot [HD]copy of "" Friends"" , is not so bad, but many years watch shows like this , i need a break , ok!"
3,My Mistake Is My Husbands Gain,"Its a nice whisk , the one problem is its HUGE . Far too large for my hand but just perfect for my husband. So my mistake was my husbands gain :)"
3,fun but,um...the only reason I play football is to do the tricks and score. In this game those are the two hardest things to do. I get frustrated so I don't play it anymore. But if your up for the challenge...
3,Hmmm....,the graphics werent good.. the controlls werent that great either... winning eleven is deff. better
3,Not as pretty in person......,"Good, would buy again but not as spark and awe in person as the pic. Made in China, of course."
5,Where the Crimson story begins,"King Crimson, the godfathers of Prog Rock made demos in 1968 before they were King Crimson under the name Giles, Giles and Fripp. Make no mistake. This is a King Crimson album, even though it is titled Giles, Giles and Fripp, since King Crimson has always had a tradition of revolving door band membership. So, why exclude this work? It is also one of their best. Sure, there are the one hundred and one versions of 21st Century Schizoid Man available on their many live albums, but this is the beginning of one of the most interesting bands in musical history, with a sound reminiscent of The Velvet Underground, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd and early David Bowie. It is a must for every Crimson fan and anyone who listens to music. Get it? And get it!"
3,Good Game,"Well, if you still have an original X-Box and love soccer, you'll love this game. I think it's the last FIFA SOCCER game made for this system."
2,a disappointment,"I bought this CD thinking it looked interesting and a bit different. Well, different it is, interesting it is not.The Vatican Orchestra is so out of tune and full of flaws that is was at times painful to listen to. The accompanying choir is equally bad. Even the Harlem Gospel Choir is not up to par. Maybe it's also a case of bad audio mixing. About the only track I enjoyed was the the Bulgarian Voices-with their unusual and raw vocal sound. In this day of great Christmas recordings, this lags far behind."
2,"Dark pictures, short-lived batteries, and a LOOONG wait!","We purchased this camera specifically for taking pictures at our wedding last year, and the pictures came out dark and grainy. Minus one star.Agreeing with another reviewer, the batteries could last a little longer. Minus another star.Also, if you want to be at all spontaneous, this may not be the right camera for you. It takes forever to turn on and to switch from camera to preview mode and back again. Also, it defaults to the triple flash for red-eye reduction, which I would rather not use all the time. That's three stars downIt is small, though. And easy to use. For that I will give 2 stars. But if I had to do it over again, I would have purchased a different camera."
2,No punch in the batteries,"The Nikon Coolpix line is very good, BUT the flash battery capability on this model is almost worthless. Starting from a full charge, you get only about 3-4 flash shots, and the recycle time is unacceptably long in any case. I had a Nikon swivel 2100, and the battery system on that (rechargable lithium)was great. The 3100 really fell off the rails!"
1,"Low battery life and slow shutter, muddy prints","I really do not reccommend this camera. Frst of all, the battery life is extremely low. I can usualy go no more than 1/2 hour before I need to put in fresh batteries.The print quality is terrible: all my mictures come out with muddy colors, no matter where I get them printed.and the time it takes the shutter to open after I press the button is about 1.5 seconds: way too long if you are trying to capture a picture of a moving subject (like my two year old daughter).I do not reccommend this camera at all."
1,Broken,The auto focus is broken in less than a year. It is totally unusable and cannot be repaired. Don't buy this item!
1,Expected much more from a Nikon....,"After about a year, I started experiencing the battery charge issues mentioned in a few of the other reviews. At first, I thought it was my charger, so I bought disposable batteries and took a trip to Europe. I could get about 5-7 pictures before the camera told me the batteries were dead. Since I was in Europe I kept buying batteries until about 1/3 of the way through the vacation, then the camera died.We just returned from vacation so I have not started the process of trying to get it fixed, but I am expecting the worst.Don't buy this camera!"
1,Serious design problem with battery life,"This camera takes great pictures - no doubt about it - but you only get about 10 pictures from a freshly charged set of batteries. The batteries are 1.5 volt batteries - once they get to 1.4 volts they are ""exhausted"". Too bad - a great little camera, but don't take this on vacation - or anywhere important. Nikon needs to fix this problem."
2,Not impressed,"My camera is currently back at Nikon being ""fixed"" after 4 months of ownership. It would freeze up and stop working. I had to adjust the brightness evry time I took a picture. The quality of the pictures I had developed were bad-grainy and dark. I went to a great film processor, too. Don't buy this camera!"
4,Amazingly small... very effective camera,"I had previously purchased the coolpix 2000 and wasn't thrilled with it. The biggest drawback is that it didn't have a viewfinder... you had to look at the mini-monitor.The coolpix 3100 improves greatly on that camera. It does have a viewfinder... it seems about half the size (and thats saying something since the 2000 was acceptably small and light. And, throw in an extra mega-pixel and I think its well worth the money ...Biggest drawbacks: In low light it gets very grainy looking. Also the ""auto redeye reduction"" in the sofware is not great. The manual redeye included in the software works better (and thats good enough for me)."
1,Stop working in a month,"I ordered the warmer in Dec 9, 2008 and received it from Amazon in a week. With this price, I thought to give it a try. The warmer doesn't warm up quickly. Although it comes with 3 setting: low, med, high, I have always to set it to high. Even though I set it to high, the warmer is not warm enough. I'm returning this product and will get one with better quality."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"We used this product for one day and it never heated up. I have called the company several times and they have never responded to my calls. I am not sure if Amazon is responsible, or if I should continue to contact the company as requested on the information sent with the pad. I ordered a different one from another company and it works great."
1,Use a twin pad instead!,"The thing about this table warmer is that there is no way to wash it! The cord is permanently attached and, unlike bedding electricial mattress pad, it cannot be detached and thrown into the washing maching.-Karen"
1,Don't waste your money,"great concept, horrible execution. It comes with few instructions and after a while the ""insta set"" function stops working. It has no real daylight savings time mode so you have to switch timezones to get the correct time. Now it has stopped displaying the correct time and is about 30 minutes off. There is no way to manually overide this so it's going in the trash."
2,style over substance,This fashionable lightweight collection of tunes whilst having a Spanish looking woman on its' cover doesn't sound either cutting edge (as claimed on the cover) or very Spanish to these ears. There is nothing really 'wrong' with the tunes except for the fact that 10 out of 21 tracks were written by the same people Beatriz Nunez and David Ferrero under different pseudonoms. This made me feel ripped off as I was hoping for a more varied sampler. Pleasant but definately not cutting edge whatever that may mean.
4,A good nose-burying book!!!!!,This one was good. The woman in the story is fighting for her life and he S.O.B. of a husband is non-supportive. Very edgy and sad. Good book overall!!!!!!
5,loving it,I love Tamia and this CD. This is one of my favorite cd from Tamia and I hope she makes another cd.
4,I was more than satistifed with my purchase!,"Between Friends is her best cd! I was hesitant about buying this cd because her cd, More, sucked. After I completely listened to each song, I was able to pick out my favorites. I am so delighted that she was able to have a creative voice on this album.My favorites:AlmostCan't get enoughMy last first kissLove and ILeast favorites:Sittin on the jobDaydreamingWhen a womanWhy can't it beBest cd I have bought, since Mary J. Blige, Breakthrough."
2,Between Bad and Not So Good,"I've been a Tamia fan for years. Each of her previous 3 albums was untapped brilliance. I say untapped because for some reason she doesn't get the big radio push or the wide acclaim. But here albums, before this one, were the type you could start at track 1 and just let it ride.This album was beneath her. It was too easy and almost formulaic. Maybe the label, maybe the management and maybe Tamia herself was trying to cash in on the wave of forgettable artists and sounds that hit it big. But honestly, I just expected so much more and was completely let down."
4,Passion is a fashion,"Frausdots is an LA band that has been playing around a lot. The mastermind behind the band is Brent Rademaker who played with Beachwood Sparks and The Tyde. Whereas those bands were into Psychedelic rock and Gram Parsons, this new band is obsessed with new wave. ""Dead Wrong"" sounds like the first New Order album. Rademaker has said that this is the record he wanted to make since high school. ""Fashion Dead Trends"" is more like early U2, although the vocals are different. ""The Extremist"" is more like his previous bands. ""A Go-See"" deals with models seeing photographers. This is about fashion, right? Some music here seems inspired by Joy Division and some by The Doors. This album peters out at the end a little bit. ""Tomorrow's Sky"" is a wonderful song to end with. Rademaker has a cast of characters around him to make interesting things happen. Hopefully Frausdots sticks around for a while. What are Frausdots?"
1,It's not Incense and Peppermints,"This is a compilation of a few songs from their first four albums. It only has 4 songs from the original 1967 release of the same album name. You'd think they'd use a different name for the CD, but since SAC only had one huge hit I guess this type of marketing is expected.I'm not saying this is a bad CD. It has lots of nice stuff, althought the sound isn't that good. It's a good cheap starter if you want to check SAC for the first time. But, if you are being nostalgic and want The Strawberry Alarm Clock and you want their original hit album this isn't the one to get.There is a Japanese Import that looks like it's the original album...at least it's available somewhere."
2,"Great potential storyline, high cringe factor!","Although I have given it a low rating, you can see what it is the film makers (showcase) were trying to acomplish, and to some extent they have been successful. Despite the film being flawed with poor quality and silly mistakes (overhead microphones bobbing in and out of camera shot, the lead character calling someone by their name , then 10 seconds later asking their name), it's storyline can be quite touching in places and is worth a look if you are seeking family entertainment. I would be interested to know if this is available anywhere on VHS in PAL format as I am unable to locate it in my country (UK)."
5,Low-Key Superstar,"Kid Koala is not like most DJ's, and I'm not sure I even know how to write a review for his style, I've listened to LOTS of DJs over the years, and he's a different breed. Koala is not really a ""Party"" DJ, he's more a sit back with a drink, headphones on, and chill DJ, he's the type of DJ you can let your non hip-hop, non hip friends in on, and they'll love him just as much as you do..."
4,Better Live,"I am a fan of the whole Ninja Tune aesthetic so, when I heard that Kid Koala had finally canned and released this full-length scratch-n-riff affair, I was intrigued. Upon purchasing and partaking of this disc I must say that it is a bit short and inconsistent. Often the groove is buried or cut off before it comes to life. Still, overall, 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome' is worth picking up as there are moments of mind-bending dexterity. I was in NYC this past week and caught Kid Koala and Amon Tobin at the Bowery Ballroom. While Amon Tobin's recordings are much more rewarding than those of Kid Koala, KK's live show is unbelievable and well outpaced the too-studious presentation of AT(KK went sans headphones to boot). Regardless of what you think or feel about 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,' if the opportunity arises, treat yourself to KK in a live setting."
2,Not the same classic!,"Beware if you purchase this item. The soundtrack has been dubbed over with new music. It is a hack job, it appears half the show is re-edited and cut out. It's not the same classic, regurgitated as a run-of-the-mill, everyday novela.Usted tenga pendiente si compra este video. La musica esta cambiada, la novela esta cortada, y ahora parece como qualquier novela. No es la misma clasica que era antes."
1,Waiting for something to happen,I patiently watched this film for about an hour waiting for a plot to develop. No such Luck. I expected to be dazzled by the array of stars in the film. Wrong again. The ending of the film is ridiculous. This is one boring film from front to back. I'll take Bringing Up Baby any day.
3,Homeschooler,"I saw a clip from this movie in one of my sister's Switched-on Schoolhouse classes. It featured a very realistic-looking William Penn, a chess-playing Charles II, and Lord Halifax."
2,"""Risk is our business""","In most respects a so-so episode, Return to Tomorrow is notable for Kirk's ""Risk is our business"" speech --one of Trek's all-time great, defining moments, and a statement of purpose for the entire series and those which followed."
1,Daisy of Dumb,"Daisy De La Hoya, the first runner-up in Rock of Love II, was the third previous reality show contestant to star in a ""Flavor of Love"" franchise spin-off. Though she was a memorable character, she did not do justice in this show. She made so many dumb decisions in eliminating people. The guys were just as dumb playing detectives against each other. But nothing was dumber than Daisy falling for London. London QUIT in episode 4, and then he comes back because she still loves the guy, so she picks him in the end. This violates the old ""QUITTERS NEVER WIN"" saying loud and clear.And on top of that, she eliminates the season's most rightful winner, 12 Pack, on an airplane before the final 2."
1,Horrible and wasted my time,"My husband and I bought this product for some books and little trinkets we have that we don't want ruined by the cat... It looks bigger in the picture!! It came in a timely matter but was missing hardware, and we couldn't even put it together. We called customer service and they said we had to ship it back and they would send a new one. They sent a new one fast and luckily for us we had yet to send the other one back. Because upon receiving the other one It had two of the same doors and missing door handles..We just took what we needed from the two and now have a wobbly cabinet.. It was totally not worth the money we spent and i would not recommend it to anyone!I would put no stars but they wont let u.."
2,poor design,It is very attractive but poorly designed. The support bar prevents you from using one of the shelves for CDs. The support reduces the depth of the shelf and the door will not shut if used for CDs. The middle shelf is completely useless as a result.
4,media room cabinet,Worth the money - quick ship - free shipping a plus. Will probably order another one.
5,As specified.,"It was easy to put together and the measurements were as stated. I had a specific space it had to fit into. It is not top of the line furniture, but decent and affordable. It provides a nice looking display cabinet for our collection of reproductions of antique books and keeps them free of dust. Totally satisfied."
3,"""Big Time Suspense"" kinda","This script could've been a "" bigtime"" suspense movie without all the stereotyping.. A beautiful women predator in a dating environment., And the men never expecting the ""grim reeper""... The movie was watchable, It needed more suspense & finesse..."
3,Good for what they are,"I purchased these as a present for a friend...and they did not do what I had hoped they would.I was anticipating that there would be multiple uses for them, but there are not.The one and only way they work is to plug them in with the included power cord. You cannot run them with no power, and not on batteries.They sound decent enough, but I wanted them to be more portable than they are. They will be perfect for work computer, or with your IPOD as long as you are near a power source.They are very cheaply made, and were lighter than I anticipated...there is nothing to them.They do serve their purpose for the price, just dont expect much."
1,Feeling stupid for buying,"Please, I read the reviews and decided that this book couldn't be as bad as people said it was so I bought it anyway, don't make the same mistake, this book is seriously bad, McGraw-Hill should be ashamed. For instance, the LCD controller part of the book involves the construction of a home-made seven segment numeric display! That isn't even an LCD! This book probably would be good for high schoolers wanting to mess around with the AVR system but if you graduated from HS please buy better book than this one."
1,A new Datasheet,Reading this book is like reading the Atmel Datasheet and some applications notes.I do not recomment this book.Georges
4,totally decent,"I like the majority of songs on this release. I bought Orbital's 'In-Sides' during the fall a few years back and this album gives me the same cool weather pleasure. Most surprising, to me, is the track 'Illuminate', which features current fey sweetheart David Gray. It's a damn good song. For me to admit that I dig a song with David Gray on it is a big deal. The song's so good, it's almost worth the price of admission alone. 'Funny Break' is also superb, classic sounding Orbital. You get another 11 tracks on a bonus disc and they all suffice as very listenable electronic compositions. I find it hard to believe that any long time Orbital fan would be THAT disappointed with this album. This is definitely going in my top ten of the year. And..just to gloat a bit..I got this for exactly ONE DOLLAR. Now, that's a bargain!"
3,Not one of their best efforts,"I've been a big fan of Orbital for 8 or so years now, and had to buy this album purely for the sake of completeness. I can't say it's one of my favourites (that would have to be the Brown Album). It seems to lack the depth of previous releases, instead relying on strange samples and gimmicks like the Dr Who remix. That's not to say that there aren't a couple of gems on the album, Funny break for one. I don't know why so many people hate Illuminate, I find it an incredibly uplifting tune. Here's hoping they tire of this new direction and go back to making decent tunes."
4,The DVD-A Version of Bach Greatest Organ Works Volune One,"This is the DVD-Audio Version of a Pioneer Classics DVD""Bach Greatest Organ Works Volume One"". The organist is HansAndre Stamm, and unlike the DVD Video version This DVD-Audioversion lets the listener hear the works in their full 96K/24bitdigital glory.Hopefully Pioneer will release a Volume Two version in DVD-Audio."
4,Pain that Lingers,"If there is a purpose for pain, philosophers tell us, it is so that we depend more on God and get further along the way than less fortunate folk who don't have as much pain and suffering. Melanie May has matured beyond cyncicism. Her pain has been so deep and on so many levels that her relationship with God permiates every aspect of her life. Her poetry can be tasted, her language owns the reader and her process possesses us. We can share her pain and travel with her on the journey through her story. Many fuzzy-thinking philosophies lose the reader somewhere after the introduction, but Melanie May gets her hooks into us and we can't get loose. Even after closing the cover at the end, there is food for thought long afterwards."
4,Microwave Mitts ROCK!,"I recv'd a pair of these for xmas 2 yrs ago and they are the best thing since sliced bread. Mine have magnets so they hang on the side of the microwave and no more burnt fingers when the dishes are too hot to remove! The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the price. I thought they'd make the perfect stocking stuffer for friends and family until I saw the price. Sure, I suppose not burning your hands is worth it, but then why aren't regular potholders for the stove that expensive? If you find these at a reasonable price, scoop all you can up for everyone you know!"
4,The Highway angler IV,"I live the in the lower 48, and have been to Alaska to fish twice, both times from the road. I am a do-it-yourself kind of guy. I have learned that timing is very critical to a successful fishing trip in Alaska. A week or two one way or the other can make a big difference. The strength of this book (The Highway Angler) is it's many charts which show when certain types of salmon are in the individual rivers and streams. Based on my limited experience, the book looks to be right on in its evaluations. Now I am ready to return and try some fishing in places I found in this book.Nick Nott, Oregon"
1,Keep looking,"I am not 'really' giving the CD a 1, I am only suggesting you look harder.Paco de Lucia is a genius, and I urge you to seek out his music, including Antologia. But there are two different versions. Look for the two volume set with the red and yellow packaging, it will come as two separate and independent CDs. This version that I am reviewing here with a black cover labeled Import seems to be volume one, but the one I got in Spain is the red and yellow version, and much cheaper. It is very worth your time to hunt down both CDs. CD1 has many of the works he is best known for, but CD2 is a gem in which you understand his real ability to improvise in this form."
1,The Dub is horrible!!!!!!!!!,"I'm a kid who loves anime. When I first saw Cardcaptors I thought it was okay.But it was missing something. It made no sense!I was thinking, "" Whats going on here???"". I found out that Nelvana deleted scenes, took out episodes,and changed the dialoge,names,and the story.The Japanese Version Cardcaptor Sakura, is ALOT better than ""Cardcaptors"". It's much happier, less about the cards, and very funny! Get the Sub!!!!!!!"
5,Bliss,An exceptional book that has left a smile imprinted on my soul. Thank you Swamaji Ramananda for reminding me how to connect with the Bliss that is within us all. Jai Ma!
5,Amazing!!!,"I just wanted to let you know that I tried to place an order several weeks ago for ""BLISS NOW"": With Sri Anandamayi Ma by Dr. Swami Ramanda but you were out of his books. I finally found a store that carried Swami's books. ""BLISS NOW"" and ""From India With Love"". I ordered three sets. One set for a friend, one for my son and one set for me. Swami's books are beautifully written, timeless, uplifting and amazing and his CDs have touched my soul. I can hardly wait to purchase his newest book. His works have been an inspiration to many and especially to my son that is incarcerated and will be released soon.I hope you will have Swami's works available soon as I appreciate ordering and referring my friends to your company.Thank you for continuing to be such a great company!Sincerely,Noble B."
5,home improvement company owner,"I've purchased this tool at a wood show and it replaced all other cordless tools that were not designed for use as screw drivers. It is the tool that I most brag and rave about, I use it every day in my work. Surprisingly, no body knows about this wonderfull tool (central NJ) on the other hand, in my last visit to Israel I saw the tool every place and even in the smallest work shop. Apparently something is wrong with Makita's advertisment. It is a wonderful tool but I wish that the battery will last longer. Sincerely- David Almogi."
1,could have been a great book,"The book is full of typos and mistakes which make every proof a headache to read and understand. This is my third book by the same publisher and they are all of similar quality, full of typos and logical mistakes. Both are deadly sins but they are even deadlier in math books so just stay away from Birkhäuser books when it comes to math."
1,"poor quality, not worse the money","This Adult Dance of the Seven Weils Belly Dancer Costume is very pretty on the picture but is very poor quality, side the seam on skirt is ripped and even not finish seam on botton the skirt. It is not worse the money."
3,"This is a budget compilation, not an album...","Hopefully fans realize that this is not an actual album, it's a non-remastered 1990's MCA budget compilation. In fact, except for the song, ""What's Your Name"" and a couple others, 90% of the songs on here come from the 1974 ""Second Helping"" album. There are definitely better sounding Lynyrd Skynyrd greatest hits packages available."
1,wrong packaging at source,the discs are supposed to be side 1 & 2 but both the discs in the box are side 1. must be due to wrong packaging at source.
1,Ho hum,"This unprofessionally put together book (just look at the table of contents) is nothing new, and the questions are certainly not ""fantastic."" The format is the same old same old multiple choice and the supposed trivia is stuff we already know or worse, don't care about. The author's foil answers are supposed to be funny, but they're rather goofy. What a waste of money."
1,Mismatched lengths of spark plug extenders.,Only one extender out of six was the right length. The other five were too short. Returned and purchased a set locally that worked fine.
1,No Door! No Timer!,"I chose this toaster oven because of it's features, as described on-line, it's clean design and all black color - that matches my kitchen. I was very happy to receive the package and dumped my old toaster oven to the trash. I was very disappointed to realize that the products door was not connected on one side - what must be done before a assembly - and therefore it's useless, leaving me without a toaster oven that I need a few times a day! A poor assembly is a bad indication. I also realized that the toaster-oven does not have a timer!!!"
5,A must read!,"I read this book in a communications class in junior college. I do not have kids, but it is the foundation of the way I relate to people and to my students. So many people do not know how to talk with others without blaming. This book shows you how to own your power and let others have theirs, too."
3,Be careful if your hands are damp,"The mitt is nice and long so your arm is protected, however, if your hands are a little damp, the water will conduct the heat and the mitt does not work very well. Otherwise, I liked it for the length and the ease of clean-up."
1,The mid-90s called. They want their designs back.,"I'm not sure who the intended audience for this book is, but everything in here reminded me of being 15 in the mid-90s. There's a section on turning straight leg jeans into bell-bottoms, which is funny because I was hoping to learn how to do the exact opposite.I guess if you have a ""funky"" teen or pre-teen that's learning how to sew, this would be an okay gift. There wasn't a single thing in here that I would make though."
4,Student Review,This book was a big help for learning advanced statistics. The text on each topic is descriptive without being too longwinded. The examples given in the text apply to many different situations. I highly reccomend it as a statistics cookbook.
4,Nice purse...,"What can I tell you about this purse? It's nice and well made, I bought it as a gift for Christmas holidays since the quality and price were equal and reasonable. This was a nice experience but I ranked this purchase as 4 starts because this seller wasn't prompt enough to explain why delay did occur. But since this is a purse review, I can tell you if you are animals friendly type but still addicted to fur items this is a good item to own since it's made of fake fur and stripes are made of nice leather (I presume also fake but well made). If your girl likes purses, this one is a good one to buy to make her happier..."
3,Thoreau quotes and southeastern Pennsylvania photographs,"Writer-naturalist Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) and artist Andrew Wyeth (1917- ) not only share a birthday: they were born exactly 100 years apart. Thoreau had the town of Concord and the Concord River to inspire him. Andrew Wyeth has Chadds Ford and the Brandywine River. This large coffee table book places quotes from Thoreau against -- not Wyeth artwork -- but photographs of the Brandywine area taken by James A. Warner and Margaret J. White. Some of the sites depicted also appear in Wyeth's work, and eight pieces of his own are actually reproduced here. The photos are lovely and the quotes are nice enough. Thoreau's words are printed in all caps, making them appear to shout from the page. It's kind of an odd combination of text and images: loud sentences and bucolic rural scenery. This book may appeal to Wyeth fans or to natives of southeastern Pennsylvania."
3,"Really tedious and convoluted plot, but Katherine's a hoot in drag.","The first half-hour or so was pretty good. Then the director/writer/who-knows-who-else introduced a zillion plot angles just to liven things up. Or something. At which point we should have just shut off the tape and done something we like better. We stuck it out, hoping it would all come together, and at the end looked at each other and said ""What the hell happened?""Still, if you love Katherine H, you'll like seeing one of her earlier works."
5,Another Great Revelation by Gene Matlock,"Gene Matlock has done it again. He is one of the few modern historian who is not afraid to speak the truth and keeps revealing ancient secrets of India through his amazing findings. His views runs parallel with several historians and scholars such as Dr. David Frawley, Stephen Knapp, George Feuerstein, Godfrey Higgins, Mark Kenoyer to name a few. This is an excellent linguistic approach by Matlock. I first saw Gene's articles at viewzone.com and since then he has opened new doors for me to Indian civilization. Most people try to discredit him but I would request you not to listen to any, but instead find the truth yourself. THIS BOOK IS WORTH EVERY PENNY and I guarantee you will be surpised by the facts presented in this book. I have no doubt Gene's next book will be another Gem!"
4,Samsung SCX-4100 Toner,"This product (toner) arrived on time and in perfect condition. I've purchased for Amazon before and have always received excellent service. About the toner: It works great. Not sure what to review on toner... It does what it's supposed to do, I guess. My letters, papers etc.. look great when I print them. It doesn't do enaything extraordinary however. It just does what it's supposed to do."
3,"Not really fair to ""rate,"" but...","These are by and large good stories, but don't go looking for much in the way of explanations. Homes creates characters who do weird things, but there is no motivation, no confrontation, no nothing. It's just a literary device.Speaking of literary devices, Homes is another in a very long list of contemporary writers who cram as many similies onto a page as will fit. Practically everything is ""like"" something else."
1,This is Sick!,"This book reads like the meanderings of an acid trip. The story ""A real Doll"" is like entering the pathetic mind of an oversexed adolescent. I find no value in reading about a perverted relationship between a boy and his sister's Barbie doll not to mention his later degeneration to homosexual masturbation with the Ken Doll. Homes is one sick puppy. The only reason I gave the book one star is because I could not rate it lower."
1,Very disappointed,"Way overpriced. I bought this 5 years ago and truth be told this was not a good purchase, one of my worst purchases. It does a mediocre job collecting dust and dirt. The turbine head does a pathetic job picking up dirt and is really useless. The little curtain attachment does a better job than the big turbine head. The telescopic wand broke with minimal use and customer service was just useless with a long wait to talk to customer service. This is clumsy piece and it has a very short cord. Cleaning it is a really dusty dirty job which needs to be done frequently and it leaves a cloud of dust. If you have allergies then this is not the vac for you.I am back using my 20 year old eureka vac. This 5 year old dyson went out with the trash.Bottom line;I will never purchase a dyson again and neither would I recommend it."
4,Midsomer Murders,"This is an excellent collection of episodes from the BBC series 'MidSomer Murders'. The packaging for the individual dics is unique! It's a flip page style, like in a book.The only fault I could find was there were no subtitles for the hearing impared."
5,Midsommer Murders,"We love this series! We were introduced to them from our Biography channel until they quit running it this year. Which was unfortunate for us, because we were hooked. This English series has ""real"" people acting. (Not everyone is a supermodel, or a size 0, or works out and has bulging muscles.) These actors are much more believeable because they could be your neighbor, your co-worker, family, etc. These episodes are about 2 hours in length and make for a nice diversion in the winter evening if you enjoy a good ""whodunit"". I don't think I have ever correctly guessed who the villian is until they were revealed at the end of the show. They have many multi twists and turns in their plots! A very entertaining series! I wish we had an American version like this!"
5,ONE MAN SHOW!!!,This is why I admire Grace Jones. The name of the video and the picture on the cover of the video speaks volumes about her. She couldn't be molded. She broke the mold. She's in a class of her own. Grace is visually stunning as is this video compilation. Watching these videos and performances leaves me wanting more. Be prepared to be taken on a mind trip.
5,"Grace , my love!!","I certainly hope this vhs video of Grace will be restored and remastered on DVD! The video , the music are all great and to have this on DVD would be a dream!!How about it guys at Island?"
5,Great book for communication studies,Hello. I was first introduced to this text in Thomas Frentz ethonography course during my graduate work at the University of Arkansas. I found it to be a wonderful text that I often refer too. Lisa uses vivid language and phenomonal research perspectives to create a wonderful book that truly details some of the relationship questions that surround gay/straight friendships. She also sensitively outlines many concerns that gay men have regarding their lives. Lisa has written an excellent text and I encourage everyone to purchase it. [...]
4,Nice Addition to the Spice Rack,"I had purchased this because I had gotten hooked on Himalayan Pink Salt at the local grocery store. They offered it in small rocks in a grinder container. Seeing this online, It was much cheaper to purchase it in this size, especially since I already had a grinder.. This stuff adds great texture to a meal when you finish it with a small crust of it. The only reason I gave this particular kind 4 rather than 5 stars is that the salt is already pretty finely ground, when I thought I was getting something similar to the small rocks of salt I was getting before, and I could grind it as I wanted it. Still a good buy, though. I barely ever use regular iodized salt for anything other than pasta water any more."
2,"Okay, But A Bit Outdated","An illustration student, I got this book thinking that it would prove useful for all types of techniques. However, not only is a lot of the information outdated, most of the methods are given only a few pages of description. I was most interested in what he had to say about gouache but there were only one or two pages dedicated to the medium.Honestly, I was going to say that this book is a good idea for people who have very minimal knowledge of the subject, but it's such a quick introduction that I think anyone, even beginners, would do well to pick up a more in-depth manual. It definitely doesn't deserve the title of ""Bible""."
2,Not as good a previous generation,"I bought the model 7735x and was not ver happy with this model. Loved the previous generation that was made 2 years before this. The attachment was poor quality. The shaver head has a yellow rubber piece that keeps the flip spring in place, once the yellow rubber piece falls out and the spring pops out, you'll having nothing but trouble.I has not happy with my shaver and sent back to Norelco for repair since I live overseas, they sent me a check for $80.00, this model sells here for $99.95?I like using the shaver in the shower and I will spend the extra money to get the next better Norelco shaver, the reviews seem a little better. Norelco has always gave a good shave, but the quality of the shavers are not as they once were."
4,Lotion aspect not as cool as it seems,"I bought this shaver for my boyfriend after he ineptly and regularly cut himself with other models. While the lotion feature seems neat, the button is, in my opinion, poorly positioned and the replacement packets seem over-priced. I'd recommend just using normal shaving gel. What's cool about this shaver is that you can take it in the shower, a feature commonly found on chick electric shavers but not on men's."
4,Pleased!,"I got this for my boyfriend who keeps a shaved head as well as face and he loves it. Also was thrilled about the convertible electrical setup, being that he's overseas. I'm having a hard time finding the gel packs in local stores (target, etc) but other then that, no complaints. He said it's a great shave!"
2,If you want the Real Macoy buy CardCaptor Sakura,"If you like CardCaptors seriously consider getting CardCaptor Sakura. CCS has more character development and better voice acting. Its characters are much more endering and real with their crushes and family life. Als CCS is in the correct episode order not the order Nelvana has (8,12,23,3...). Your child will love it much more,(it isn't the action paced, pokemon clone they made it to be, but a sight to love) So it is within your best intrest to get CCS insted of CC. Plus your chil will learn to read more with subtitles a plus!"
5,This is a VHS you've gotta see!,"I completely love the episodes on this VHS! The adventures that Sakura,Madison, and Kero get into are just completely magical to the viewer!"
5,great for hair loss,"this shampoo decreased my hair loss by about 80%. my hair still falls out but much less than before, and this is the only shampoo that has worked for me. i probably have a hormonal imbalance by pcos, and this shampoo has decreased the rate of hair loss."
2,The Poor Bastard,I was disappointed in the material of the book. Was not what I expected. That's OK. It's not your fault. It's mine for making the wrong chose.
1,Terrible writing style,"I was very disappointed by this book. The worst part was the author's writing style. It was full of misplaced or useless parenthetical interjections, and he couldn't seem to get his point across without half a page of footnotes for each paragraph. This was not an easy read -- I felt as though I was stumbling around on the pages. I never seemed able to squeeze a clear and concise idea out anywhere in the book. It also requires more math than I was hoping for."
1,Very dissapointed with this book.,"I purchased this book in the hope of learning something more about the concepts of quantum mechanics. I had hoped the book would allow me to understand the theory better. After reading through the entire book, though, I can only say I am even more confused than when I began. The author does a miserable job at explaining the concepts of the theory. His explanations are confusing and inadequate. The math he uses does not help. He skips many math steps making it impossible to know how he is arriving at his conclusions. I would not reccomend this book to anyone."
4,Tobruk,I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone that likes war movies. Iwas full of action and suspense and betrayed some of the fighting that the Jewish did in World War 11 serving in the British army.
5,Great work out,"I had been trying everything, including walking outside(that didn't work because of large dogs in area)and jogging at the park.My schedule is rather hectic and it's hard for me to drive to the park daily. While watching t.v one day I discovered the Leslie Sanson walk at home video. I loved it the first time I tried it. The pace is perfect for me at 44 years old and It really does give you a workout. I'm comfortable doing it and it's convenient. The best part is i've went down 2 pant sizes. Love it, love it, love it!!!!"
4,Pleased with this product,"I am pleased with the CD. However, I wish the stretch/cool down portion would be at the end of all scene selections."
4,Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home - 5 Mile Walk,I love this video. It is great and I am using it every day. It will really get you into walking and you can do it inside in the comfortable air conditioning.Great video.
4,Great video but needs a few more things,Great video. I do think that the fast miles are a little short of a mile. It would be nice to have the mile counters like past videos. I like the options of having music only. I also think the weight portion of the video could have incorportated more toning for the triceps. Overall it is quick and and great workout.
4,5 Fun Miles!,"I love love LOVE this DVD! It's a great work out, it's easy yet it burns tons of calories and makes me feel stronger. I'd give it 4.5 if I could give 1/2 Stars. The only thing I'd change with this is: In the 3 Mile options, the cool down should be included at the end of the work out. That's all. Otherwise, I absolutely recommend this :)"
4,"Great movie, wonderful addition to the books","I have always loved the Narnia books, and this movie didn't change the story very much, execept that they made Trufflehunter female. The special effects look rather fake (which is why I gave it four stars instead of five), but the scenery, the costumes, and the actors are wonderful. My favorite actors in this movie are: Ronald Pickup (the voice of Aslan), Samuel West (the older King Caspian), Richard Dempsey (Peter) and, of course, my VERY favorite, Jonanthan Scott, who did a spectacualar job playing Edmund. All in all, I think think this movie is great!"
1,crude,"This thing works , but is very uncomfortable, and I've had alot better ones made by other manufacturers,oh yeah, and it's made in china !!!"
1,doesnt look like its picture,"i cant believe i spent that much and bought two frames and the color doesn't even look like its picture, i had to paint them myself and it looks worse now, basically waist of money"
2,How about redesigning the power system,"Great trimmer with a rather unique feel and design. I am 57, a red head gone white with lots of fine hair. The vacuum is acceptable if you empty it frequently. The adjustable length setting is a nice feature.Now this thing needs to have some healthy battery power and life, come on now, pitifully weak batteries with a short charge, 14 hour charging time and won't work while plugged in the wall. You best plan ahead for a trim. Not at all convenient. I'd rather have a corded version, more flexibility. Pssst....Norelco...think Lithium Ion or Nickel Metal Hydride for pity's sake."
4,Even good for cloth diapering!,"We've had our wipe warmer for almost 5 years now. These little pillows just make it even better! We've never had a dry wipe unless someone *ahem, hubby* leaves the top open. Since we've had our third baby, we have switched to cloth diapers and these even keep the bamboo and terry cloth wipes fresh and moist. I love these things!"
1,mold growth,"It's the second time I see mold growth on the pillow. I've owned the warmer for the past 9 months. It's being used as instructed. The current one is not due for replacement till January 4th while I found the mold on December 14th.On top of the mold, the pad turns yellow, slimy and slippery and have a smell after a month.It's very disappointing to have a mold problem with the warmer as it's a product for little babies. Babies could possibly get very sick from this.I have emailed the company. Hopefully, I will hear from them regarding this."
3,"Okay, for an okay warmer","These last longer than the packaging says. But if they dry out, they will yellow and get hard. You can always re-moisten them, but they don't seem to work as well after that. Honestly, these lasted longer than the warmer itself which stopped warming after about 9 months."
3,It was okay,Nice to read about famous people who made something great out of themselves in spite of their age. Good reading and gives hope to folks over 50. Never give up on a dream!
4,Great Razor!,"I have been using this razor for about a year and three months and it is great. I have dropped it a couple of times and it has completly disassembled itself, but I just put it back together and it still works perfectly. The Nivea product is good for my dry face. In my opinion there are two negatives to this product. (1) It is really difficult to shave my lower neck area without the razor pinching me and (2) The shave that you get is NOT as close as a blade... I don't care if it IS Norelco's slogan for this product. However, the shave is close enough for me. It just means that if you have a light beard like me, you will still have to shave every day (when I shaved with a razor I could go a couple of days between shaves) Besides the two negatives I mentioned, I think that this is a great product and I would recommend it if you are in the market for an electric razor."
4,Razor,I have been using this type razor for about 6 years now. I just now replaced my old one but even it was still working. I highly recommend this razor but if I had to do it over again I probably wouldn't spring for the top of the line model. It doesn't work any better that the other one that I had which was the entry level one.
3,Windfall is the one,"Lyrics from ""Someone to Love"" had been running through my head for months, but I couldn't find my vinyl copy of the album. Hard to believe I have to now buy a copy of ""garden party"" which I do still own, but to get this music, I will do it. I loved listening to the later Rick Nelson material and this is the avenue to do it."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I'd been looking for the Windfall album for YEARS and I was so happy to see it. I got it quickly, it's in PERFECT condition, and now I have the best work that Ricky Nelson ever did. I highly recommend this."
4,Nothing is Perfect,"I didn't give this book 5 stars because nothing is perfect. However, these authors have done a pretty impressive job on their book.Let me tell you what I liked: I liked the introduction where they gave you all of the important C# syntax BEFORE launching into the WEB material. Then they showed me how to get started with simple WEB projects. This included the use of important controls, properties and more.Then they even did some work on GDI graphics (and I couldn't find this material in ANY other book on the WEB that I looked at in the book store). The book ends with a couple of good WEB service examples, but I haven't gotten to writing them yet.Well, the book is about 500 pages... Pretty good deal for what I got out of it."
3,"lovely glasses, packed poorly",These lovely dishes were packed poorly. One small sheet of very thin cheap bubble wrap and two sets of glases stuffed in to a very small box with no cushioning. For a glass purchase? Really?? Broken glass everywhere....Amazon did right by me with a refund.
3,Just Okay,"This book starts out okay.Two girls pick up a lonely Hitchhiker.He seems to be running away from something(or is he).Then while listening to the radio they here of a murder supposely by a hitchhiker.Things get boring toward the middle of the book ,Yet the ending was interesting."
3,"Decent fan, came a little crooked","This fan looks decent and works well. The only problem I have with it is when it came, it didn't stand straight. The fan still worked but you can see that it's like the leaning tower of Pisa. We had to fold a small pieces of card board and wedge it between the base and the fan column to make it look straight again. Otherwise, it's a great fan- kept us cool and is very quiet."
5,Nice fan!,Fan works well and is very quiet. Circulates air well even on the lowest speed. Have used in a year without problems.
3,Does the job but cheap build,"It works, the design is sleek but week. The controls are very nice. Remote is cool, but no batteries included? That's a cheap move. Wobbles a little when it oscillates. Pretty quiet while operating."
3,Good quality and fan speed,"Fan is quiet and works great. Keeps the room cool without having to keep it cranked on high speed. ION feature is always an added bonus. Spend the extra 10-20 dollars and get this instead of its rivals. Only problem I have with this at all is that the cord is only about 4 ft long which for some is fine but I like having my fans in the center of the room and its a big room. And the other thing was the base is not the most sturdy. I have 3 kids that enjoy ""TESTING"" the mechanics and durability of how anything stands up to their force. It is better built then any of its rivals, but I've yet to find an Oscillating fan that can meet my standards. Only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 4. But function wise its a great fan for the money!"
5,Great Fan!!!,I love this fan!! Cools well and is very quiet. The remote control is a nice feature too. I definitely recommend it!
4,Great Fan,"I bought this one to replace a previous tower fan, and did so based on user reviews that mentioned how quiet this unit was (I use it in the bedroom). I don't know if it is quite as silent as some of the other reviews would suggest, but it's definitely a lot quieter than the 2 others I had previously owned. As for the ion feature; I can't be sure if it works - I'm a bit less stuffy in the mornings when I use it, but I could just be trying to convince myself it's doing something. If it indeed does have this feature, there is definitely no way to open it up and get it cleaned out to ensure it continues working - this is the only reason I didn't give the product five stars."
1,Did not work at all.,"I'm sorry to report that when we first turned it on, the fan started making a grinding noise. We double checked to make sure it was properly put together and we were following the directions carefully but it started grinding again. I immediately contacted Amazon and the retailer and asked for a refund and return postage. They were prompt to reply and gave me a full refund and emailed me a return postage label. We packed it up and took it to a FedEx office. It was to be sent to a place to find out why it did not work. I have not heard back from them. I am hoping that it was a fluke that it did not work and the customer service was excellent."
5,Donnie Darko The COMPLETE Soundtrack!,"When I bought the original soundtrack, I knew it didn't have all of the 80's music on it, but I was still dissappointed. I searched for a long time to see if anybody even made the Complete Soundtrack but I couldn't find it anywhere. Well finally one day I was on Amazon, and BOOM I found it. I immediately bought it. It is kind of pricey, but it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this product if you are a Donnie Darko fan, or even if you are just a fan of good music."
1,BAD!,"As a kickboxing instructor, this was truly a disappointment. I always buy new tapes to get ideas, but this was a pathetic display of kickboxing abilities. It is apparent that they put that girl in the video because she was cute, BUT OH SO ANNOYING!. She seemed quite proud of herself that she could stay on the beat with the music, ""5,6,7,8"" After hearing her count over and over for the first five minutes I wanted to strangle her.Don't waste your money."
2,not good quality,Not a very high quality bandana. It's thin and very light weight! I did tell the seller of my dissatisfaction and they promptly refunded my money!
3,Very Unhappy,I am very unhappy with this item. I recieved it as a gift and thought this will be great because then I won't have to use the under arm thermometer or the rectal but boy was I wrong. It never gives an accurate temp so it is no good. I am presently looking for a new thermometer that will tell me if my son has a temperature.
5,The Blues Never Made Me So Happy,"I'm 33 years old, and was a huge Zep fan from my mid teens to mid 20s. Buying this DVD set brings it all back into focus for me now and reminds me why Zepplin -- hands down -- was the greatest blues rock band ever created.Listening and watching what they threw down in the late 60s and 70s in 2003 makes you realize just how devoid of power and passion the music industry in general is today. Today's music is marketing. Zeppelin flies in the face of that -- they were all about the music and playing live. I wish I could have been at one of these shows -- the DVD comes damn close to making you feel like you were there.I can only hope that the DVD set and the 3CD live package will start another blues/rock groundswell that refocuses the music buying public's attention on the music -- not the marketing."
3,overrated,"Before buying DVD's, I always look at the average customer review, and read the first few I see. Everyone seemed to think this was a great DVD, one of the best. While I won't say it was awful, I'll definitely say it's not all it's hyped up to be. The entire first disc is an awful concert (really, it just doesn't sound good, and I think that's pretty important in music). I kind of enjoyed the second disc, but unless you're a die-hard Led Zep fan, don't buy this dvd. It costs too much for one bad disc and one ok disc."
5,The Greatest R&R band ever!,"Incredible footage, incomparable music. Has to be one of the best DVD's ever! The pure blues sex from R. Plant, guitar genious from Page, the bass line of JPJ and of course the most powerful drummer Bonzo."
3,DOESN'T PLAY IN MY REGION!!,"This stinks! I bought this dvd 3 months ago for a party at a club so I had never used it. We went to play it and get the message ""NOT COMPATIBLE IN THIS REGION"" Why in the heck didn't this seller state this?!?! This caused me embarassment and disappointment. It's not really the product but the Seller. I want a full refund including my shipping!**UPDATE - this company immediately refunded me the cost of the product and the full shipping amount. I would definitely do business with them again. I change the rating to 4 stars since they were so prompt in their action but not 5 because it should have been stated that it only plays in certain regions."
2,Dazed and Confused,"I still remember the day in high school when Paul Warhoff started raving about the new Yardbirds, or Led Zeppelin. He absolutely loved Jimmy Page. An excellent guitarist, Paul learned and played every Page song perfectly by summer. Another friend, Craig Phillips, also played guitar and Page. Summers were fantastic; surf all day and go to the Frost house(it was kind of a Brady Bunch family of hippy teenagers) to rock out with Zeppelin every afternoon and night. So, naturally, disappointed with the ""Song Remains the Same"" I jumped at the chance to see more, and, perhaps, better Zeppelin. Sadly, it isn't the case. The band plays too loud, too sloppy, and the rhythms that blast off on record are lost. I got bored watching this thing, and I turned it off. It does have moments. Zeppelin will always be one of my favorite bands, but this DVD is not worth the money."
5,Led Zepplin dvd,"This was an outstanding value ,couldn't find it in my town and found it used on amazon, like new it plays great and so I recomend several of the used dvd's I've bought from amazon, on the new ones watch for the format as several are not playable on equiptment bought in the U.S."
3,song remains the same,"nothing new, but well done. They just don't change their songs that much. Same old songs from a limited catalog."
2,"Dexterity good, but insulation poor.","I bought these gloves because they promised to keep my hands warm while providing good dexterity. They deliver on the latter promise better than any work gloves I have owned. I am able to button my chore coat, select keys, and pick up small tools while wearing them. Unfortunately, they don't do a very good job of keeping my hands warm. My fingers were numb in well under a half-hour in forty degree weather. At the price, I expected better insulation."
1,not happy,"I bought this product new from amazon and it worked first couple of times i tried it( takes a little longer then a pen type guage- you must ""hold"" onto valve a couple of seconds and put it straight on) After sitting in my glove box for 2 weeks it worked no longer! I even put in a new battery thinking that was the problem but to no avail. I sent back to amazon for possible partial return but i'm sure it is my lost. (i like amazon overall though) I would not recommended this item. G.V"
4,Inspirational and enjoyable,"Great inspirational songs performed with the uniquely familiar voice of Willie Nelson, as well as the deep quality of Merle Haggard's voice. The sincerity can be heard in their voices. The music is great for any fan of Willie-style country music and even better for those who enjoy the familiar lyrics of Christian hymns. Easy and fun to sing along with."
3,Early Story,"Although this is one of Tim Story's earlier works, it is not his best. To be sure, there are some hints of Story's later compositions which reflect a greater sense of structure, feeling and musical maturity. However, in many of the tracks on this CD, there is a sense of the artist sitting down at the keyboard and experimenting with sound combinations rather than writing from the soul. I recommend Three Feet From the Moon for a more emotionally satisfying Tim Story listening experience."
4,Excellent music!!,"Good music and good voice, you want to dance while you listen to this music. John as a voice that you always remember...Very good memories . I love this album!"
3,"Illy is better, but Kimbo is decent for the price",The espresso is okay. A little on the dry side. Illy is better and more consistent but I can't afford it.
5,Great gift idea for Healing and Protection!,One of the nicest inventions in the Kabbalah world was to take this portion of the Zohar and make it usable as a means of getting in tune with your Spirituality. As a bonus it is traditionally used as a charm for Protection and Healing!My copies have an added PLUS because they were issued for the IDF's (Israeli Army) soldiers to keep them from harms way. Get it for YOUR soldier serving in the US Army overseas to give him that extra protection from above and help him defend freedom and democracy for the good of mankind!I do accept wholesale orders as well.
2,"Idoits guide written, for idiots by idiots.","If you are having trouble opening the box, taking out the cd-rom and setting up the software, then you might find some use for this book. If you are in need of developing anykind of database driven sites then your best bet is to look else where."
1,YU Gi Oh sucks,this is really the dumbest thing ive ever seen. YU Gi Oh is such a rip off. get something good.* Anime Princess Chick * - age 10
2,Do not use..,"If you have have color-treated hair, as it stripped some of the brown out of my hair, and left it life-less."
4,This stuff works really well,"I swim at the gym 3-4 times a week. My hair was so damaged from the chlorine that i was afraid i would have to stop swimming. Then i went on line and found this product. It is gentle enough to use everyday and really gets the chlorine smell out. I've been using it for a month now and my hair is no longer brittle. One of the things i did start to do (learned it on line)is before i get in the pool, i always make sure to wet (soaking)my hair with cool water. Then i add a small amount of leave in conditioner to my hair to help lock out the chlorine some what. Between this product and the leave in conditioner, my hair is doing much better. And the color, (i color my hair for the grays) does not fade any faster than it normally would. Most people can't find this shampoo in the stores. I have only found it at CVS on the bottem shelf where no one can notice it. The price is $5.75 or so. They don't seem to carry the conditioner though."
5,Book,Shipped and received quickly. This is a book I read as a teenager and was excited to find it again.
1,Problem after 2 weeks use.,About 2 weeks after installing the cartridge it has started to make speckling in a vertical line about 2 to 2 1/2 inches from the left edge. I contacted Toner Pals and they said to contact you. I'd like to try a replacement cartridge at first. Unless this has a cost. What's next?Paul Zepf
2,Poor print quality,Splotches in the middle of page (both white and black) and a gray bar down the edge of the page.
5,Works well to extend video connection,My wife has a projector that uses VGA in her classroom. The cable that was running from it wasn't long enough to reach where she wanted to put her laptop that would provide the signal. We bought this to run the extra length and so far it has worked perfectly. Her coworker had the same issue so she got one as well. Both have been working with no problems.
2,Didn't work as expected,"This cable appears to be constructed will enough BUT for some unknown reason when I use it, I am no longer capable of using my monitor's higher resolutions! It just allows me to use low resolution settings and my system is no longer even aware that my monitor has high resolutions capabilities. I remove this extension cable and I am back to having the ability to use the higher resolutions. Go Figure! Perhaps not all the pins are connected?"
2,Bring back the1960's,"Where's Cecil Beaton when you need him. When you have the greatest singers of the last half of the 20th century, Nilsson and Corelli, you don't need all this excess! The Met has toned this production down shortly after this broadcast. This production is so busy I hardly even noticed the singing. You'll find every thing you need on the stage but a basket ball court."
3,Left a little to be desired...,"I am a huge fan of the first two books in the series, and I was really expecting the same kind of intensity that books one and two had. Most of the story takes place on another planet in another dimension, and I didn't like it as much as the previous two books where everything occured in our world.My final recommendation: Read it only after the first two books in the series. The fourth book is definitely worth the effort."
5,"Milwaukee Work Gloves, Small","I got these gloves in small and they fit my hands perfectly!Before I got these, when I needed to protect my hands a bit, I've used those big, rough work gloves from the hardware store. It was like wearing clown gloves... I had no idea I could get something like these, for this price!These are reinforced all over, on the fingers and the palms, so they will last me forever."
1,"Oh, seriously.","I think anybody could have done better, even if only using two albums to make this compilation. Do yourself a favor and buy the individual albums separately. I would pick Darkest Days first if you haven't heard that CD. It's even cheap and has 16 songs."
3,Missing A Lot Of The Greats,"I already own all of Stabbing Westward's albums, but I was still interested in a ""Greatest Hits"" CD. After reading through the songs included I just couldn't justify purchasing this CD. Too many of my favorites are missing! What's missing is ""ACF"", ""Why"", ""The Thing I Hate"", and ""Waking Up Beside You"". None of the songs from their 4th album could be included in Essentials because it is on the Koch label, not Sony. Therefore, you would be better off making your own CD and adding ""So Far Away"", ""Wasted"", ""High"", and ""Television"" from the self-titled release.P.S. If you're disappointed SW broke up you'll be happy to know that lead singer Chris Hall has started another band called The Dreaming. Check out www.thedreamingonline.com."
4,Awesome industrial/melodic depressed songs of love and life,Im glad they compiled a collection of their best songs which sound great. these guys might have been influenced by NIN but they only took that sound deeper and farther into better melodic bliss. My only complaint on this compilation(thats why I rated this 4 stars)is they chose a(although great instrumental)opening track song that has no lyrical content its just a waste of space when a way better track with Mr.Hall's awesome voice on it from the first album could been used on here but nonetheless this a great representation of what the 90's were all about.
1,What's up with this player,"I have had this dvd player for less than 6 months and it acts like it is 100 years old. DVD's will not play, the big and bulky battery no longer charges. Even pluged-in it spits and sputters. You press a button and nothing happens. The company is no help! BUY THE WARRANTY!!! It did work great the first 2 times I used it!"
5,BEST SET OF COOKWARE THAT I EVER OWNED! 5 STARS!,"After 2 years of cheapie cookware, I bought this set in black when I bought a new ceramic top range. My old cookware was not flat bottomed and it was very thin--time to go! This new Faberware set is heavy duty and I love the fry pans. The reason that I bought this set is because I have owed Faberware products before and they are exceptional quality.Pros: This set cooks evenly, quickly and very easy to clean. I feel like a professional chef using these. Cannot say enough great things about this set. In fact, I just bought a 12"" Faberware Skillet like this and also another 8"" Faberware skillet (for eggs, and more). Also note that the Faberware new line of bakeware is heavy duty and bakes well and so easy to clean, I had to have a whole set. (After buying these 2 months ago and being so pleased with them, I decided to buy this set).Cons: NONE!"
4,"Blind people can't see, they bump into me","Deaf people can't hear, they have defective ears.Dudes with good senses of humor, poor skills and talents, cheap equipment... and a great album because of it.I recommend it if you like humorious punk rock, if you're into bands like the stooges or black flag, and if you have 12 dollars to spare.A very funny CD. They influenced people like Mark Arm and Kurt Cobain and the dude from the butthole surfers. and buzz osbourne. all geniouses. buy it if you want, it's not necessary."
5,beauty for the soul,"""a wonderful way to reflect on my deepest most intimate soul desires and experiences."""
5,obscure gem,"I am so impressed with this album. I have never heard of these guys, and apparently they fell off the face of the earth after making this album. It's electro-techno-ey. Not quite dance music, but almost. It could be used to mix, if you could add some thumping bass or electro filters to it. That's what i would really like to do with this album, is remix it into club music. Everytime i listen to it i appreciate this album more. This album should appeal to fans of many types of IDM, drum and bass, techno, and jungle, but probably not people who like ibiza style dance music."
3,Good trimmer with bad battery,"This trimmer is a cordless unit that requires you to fully drain the battery before recharging it again. This is very inconvenient and I would have prefered a corded unit to this. Other than that, it's very inexpensive, versatile, and works well."
4,"Work good, but parts are tough","For the most part, this groomer has worked very well, but I only have one gripe. The deal you use to change lengths of cutting used to snap on and move very smoothly. Now I have to almost force it on and to move positions. Taking it off will remove the entire blade, so I gotta be very careful with it. I just hate it doesnt slide on and off and work as smoothly anymore. That's my only gripe."
3,So so..,"You can't really expect a lot from this all purpose groomer since it is cheap; it is basically jack-of-all-trade but master of none. Its performance is just above average, good enough for normal use, but won't satisfy you if you have high expectation. Overall I must say that I am happy with this product. So if you are like me, not really picky and just want to have it all cheap in one package, then this might be the groomer you need. Else, you better off get everything separately."
1,Waist of money,"This product delivers the results of a very poor quality. I've been using a similar item from Conair for about a year, but decided to experiment with Norelco. It was a bad idea. It takes more time to cut hair and I was not able to achieve the quality of Conair unit. The nose piece doesn't do the job at all."
2,"""WORKED"" great",Mine worked about a week great then 1 day it didn't. I emailed the seller they told me to disregard the unit and gave me my money back.. I guess they were expecting my call or it to break
4,"great comedy, bad sound","Rodney is by far one of the funniest men ever to grace a stage, and this CD represents his humor almost perfectly. I say almost because the sound is of some of the worst I have ever heard. I've missed at least 8 or 9 punchlines because of the bad sound. Granted its live, but still. Other than the bad sound this is a great CD. Pick it up."
4,I found the product easy to use except ...,"I found the product easy to use except for the cap, which was a little difficult to open. The conditioner had a pleasant smell and left my hair feeling smooth and clean. After using the conditioner it was easy to comb through my hair. I would recommend it to others."
5,5 STAR FILM,"This film had me on the verge of tears! It actually got me to join the navy, because to see how much these soldiers sacrificed for my genration, made me want to sacrifice everything i can to protect the next genration! It was totally fascinating how they put this amazing footage of soldiers and their way of life and playing the 60s music in the background as famous celebrities read the letters of young soldiers! This film is a must see! I am only 17 and i loved the film!"
5,Pre-Goth,Is this pre-goth? I think so. Along with Chrome and other bands. They paved the way. The Cure made us pretty. Thanks.ps. I love The Cure.
4,very good,"i feel that both cd's were very hot. the first one especially with my favorite being i'm a baller, chamillionaire layed down a fire hook for the song and the lyrics were on point. the second disc you have to take into consideration that it was a all freestyle cd to the beats from undaground legend. considering that i think that it is a very good buy, especially if you are feeling the other artists such as redd and lil ron."
4,Princess Terai,"Technically well done. Not as sophisticated as a Stephane Grappelli. However, it keeps you interested in themes and has feeling. A good buy for anyone looking to round their collection and add a different listening perspective. The Japanese influence underlines the work and makes it a most interesting listen. This is a very good artist and album. Expect to see her in the Western markets in the future. If you like Keiko Matsui, you should get this album."
5,Absolutely Essential,"This is a great collection of Cyndi's music. I was going to buy She's So Unusual but this album had all the great songs from that CD along with a couple of extra great songs from other albums and singles. Cyndi's music is fantastic and plays well even today (although I am biased as I grew up listening to She's So Unusual, watching her videos, and loving The Goonies). You won't regret buying this CD ... guaranteed!"
1,Will not even install,"I am trying to install the evaluation version of the product (both Titanium and Platinum) and neither one will install. They keep saying that McAfee A/V is already installed, but that computer has never *had* McAfee installed on it.I went into the web site's suport... their ""troubleshooter"" provides zero help. Their ""knowledgebase"" returns no results for the search terms ""compatibility"", ""mcafee"", ""zonealarm"", ""incompatibility"", ""incompatible"", and ""incompatible program detected""... apparently they don't think there are any such issues.I called their information line and (surprisingly) got through to tech support. They emailed me a replacement ""avdetect.ini"" file that would fix the problem... it didn't.If I could install it, it might do a fine job. But the company clearly needs to work on its install routine."
3,Needs to be more realistic,"Overall, it is a pretty good book. What I found laughable was her comparison menus in the back of the book. For the unhealthy ones there was just soda, fruit drinks, and chocolate milk listed for the entire breakfast on some days. I may not be the healthiest person in the world, but I would never give that to my child as a meal and don't know anyone else who would either. It's one thing to point out the unhealthy foods that she does with other meals; it's another to consider her examples as mainstream. There are good recipes and menus if you're raising your children vegetarian/vegan; if you aren't, this is definitely not the book for you."
3,lymphatic metastases in H&N SCC--for the specialist,"Caveat: contrary to what you might expect from the title this book is not about distant metastases, or non-squamous cell carcinomas. If you are looking for that, move on.What this book does cover is the lymphatic spread of H & N SCC. It starts with a nice account of the anatomy and development of the lymphatics of the H&N.; Further chapters cover aspects such as patterns of spread of different cancers, as well as some discussion about the (mainly) surgical approaches to dissection.Should you buy it? That depends. If you are looking for a general account of dissemination of malignancy or of H&N; SCC you will be better served with one of the more general texts. If you are after a more detailed account, and in particular a European approach to some of these issues, then yes."
3,Slow Cooker Recipe Book,"It is a cook book for slow cookers, it is as good as any other slow cooker recipe book, I have most of the recipes already."
2,2610 doesn't aquire satelites,"My new 2610 is obviously one of the small percentage, based on these reviews, that needs to go back to Garmin. It does not aquire satelites either on the dash or outside of the vehicle. I upgraded from a Garmin II+ that worked velcro'd to the dash so figured the 2610 would too. I guess I'll wait and see what Garmin has to say."
4,Garmin Has Some Problems,"I use my Garmin Streetpilot to help me locate delivery destinations for work everyday. It is supposed to help trucks maneuver through viaduct heights when set on truck mode, and yet it really doesn't. This was a selling point when I bought the unit -- so this is a disappointment. It is also supposed to keep you on designated truck routes, which it doesn't really do, either. You also lose the GPS signal in the downtown area (Chicago) - tall buildings seem to block it which is a problem when delivering in the city. Having to pay for map updates is also a disappointment since I need an update and have to pay for the new one and the unit is only a year old."
4,Good Support from Garmin,Just received the unit a week ago. The software doesn't work with Window XP Home. I called the tech support. I am very surprised that I received a copy of updated software at second day! The updated software is working fine. The unit is working fine either. I am still learning how to use all of the functions. It gave me the good direction when I use it in my car at first time.It works great! It guided me to the hotel and disney world at last week. I have not map and I have never been the places before.
3,not happy with the unit,"I am a little disappointed with garmin 2610. Several issues:1. the satellate signal is weak. I have to put it on the dash to get reasonable satellate signal. I wish it can work by sitting on the seat.2. no built-in speaker. only with external speaker.3. use car power supply, no built-in rechargeable batter.4. the voice prompt does not mention the street name when I need to make a turn. It just says the distance before the turn.I am not sure whether I will return it eventually."
1,they sent me the software that did not work.,"they sent me the software that did not work. so, I could not install the cd. therefore, I could not turn on the unit."
4,One of New Orleans' great songwriters.,"This is a fantastic album to introduce you to the work of Paul Sanchez (you'll want more). Great stuff if you are into to the rootsy , blues and folk kinda thing."
4,Much nicer look that puffy cotton hot pads,"Love the look of these - very thin, pretty color. Don't expect them to stain like my previous expensive puffy cotton ones. Stand up to heat BUT your hands will get hot in extreme temps - cooking pizza @ 500 degrees : )I am happy with them & glad I bought 2 pair * red & gry *"
1,Not for hot pots,"Grip well, but don't use them on hot items. They melt onto the pot surface and the resulting black marks are very difficult to remove."
5,Truely fine music.,"This is wonderfully atmospheric music. It takes you so many places! Although the pieces have an ethnic sound they are created electronically. Conrad has a new CD out called ""Receive."" I'm looking for it."
5,Music for people with alot of Culture!,"This music isn't for those who like GOOD music. It is almost packed with ""Archeological"" sound, no doubt Praetzel's career is evident. Buy this CD, you won't be disapointed!"
3,Crossing Jordan CD,"Just wasn't what I expected. The songs played at the end of certain episodes sounded so meaningful, but the CD just didn't excite me that much. Maybe it was the timing."
5,"beautifully written powerful,cant put down book","i read this book several years ago> I lent it to friends and keep recommending it.. and repurchased it when i realized i had never gotten it back from a friend.. Beautifully written,intimate,emotional,informative,fascinating.. ..... especially if you are an adventure traveler like myself or if you are interested in what is really going on in this unfair,violent world that many of us are unaware of."
4,A Fresh Look,"It was a breath of fresh air to read a piece of literature on the Bosnian conflict from such a personal standpoint. While Loyd, as a outsider to the war, writes effectively of the tumult of myriad forces and fronts within Bosnia, he also brings to light a fascinating dynamic of conflict and terror as a drug to the soul of modern, lost Man. Although I would have liked to read more of his musings on this, I am impressed nonetheless by it's presence. The ineffable horror witnessed by Loyd coupled with his conscious opposition towards journalistic convention deem My War Gone By, I Miss It So well worthy of a read.Of course, there are certain aspects of the story which could be expanded upon as well as cut out. But overall, especially having spent some time in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia right after the war, I find it a laudable effort."
4,Compelling,"Loyd's account here is very personal and at times very moving. The fact that he is so candid about his own ""addiction"" to seeing war and witnessing violence first hand (as well as his heroin addiction) is what makes this such a compelling read. He is also one of the the few, if not only, correspondents to be posted in the Balkans who willingly admits that he was something of a war tourist and a voyeur, viewing the suffering of others secure in the knowledge that he could leave any time. Generally Loyd's book is also free of the often sanctimonious moralizing found in accounts written by Glenny, Reiff, Vulliamy, Bell and scores of others. I can't think of any specific reason why this book is such a good read; it just is. Read it."
3,Overrated,"A spoiled child with a drug habit and no job wonders in a middle of an ethnic slaughterhouse. Has no clue as to what's going on. Writes a memoir pretending to understand. The book has its moments, but the self-pity and whining are overbearing."
1,Disappointment,Poor quality and tracking would not allow for a better picture. Poor quality took away from watching the program we all loved to watch when we were growing up.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,The Tactics Ogre strategy guide from prima is a complete waste of money. It isn't very descriptive and doesn't include some of the important sidequests. DON'T BUY IT !
2,overpriced,"Given the price north of thirty dollars, and the fact that it is made in the US by a well-known manufacturer, I expected excellent quality. But the burrs haven't been completely removed from the forging and it has a crude black oxide finish rather than chrome or nickel plating. The slip joint doesn't slip easily, making it hard to adjust the size, and there are no channels to keep it at the size you select. The soft rubber jaws are quite slippery and don't grip well- they need some texture added or a different rubber compound altogether.On the positive side, the unusual curve in the handle works well for giving it a strong squeeze.I see that Vise-Grip now makes a soft jaw plier and I would look at those first."
4,Creative Genius,"This book is a great find for anyone with an interest in German Expressionism or the Blaue Reiter Group. Meseure's treatment of Macke's early inspiration and artistic development is very balanced. But make no mistake, no one at all could walk away from this book without the feeling that August Macke should be a household name. The manner by which he synthesized elements of French Impressionism and Cubism will leave you to spend much of your spare time poring over his works. Definitely a must read!"
3,Stationary Base,The major problem I got with my planer is that it does'n have a base for stationary use. Bosch does! I would like to know when DeWalt will design one?
2,Not so good on Kindle,"I have a copy of this book in the USA, and it's great in hardcopy, but it was too heavy to lug down to Argentina. I bought the Kindle edition, but although it can be used on my Kindle device, the Kindle PC Reader cannot read it."
3,"Ummm, begging the question....","But why? Just about all these are on ""Don't Fear The Reaper; The Best Of Blue Oyster Cult,"" (which costs less, I should add) and the double ""Workshop Of The Telescopes"" fleshes things out even more. But for the price, be aware that you can do much better."
1,"beware, ricardo warranty service is terrible","The bags might be good looking and they MIGHT last for 10+ years, however, if you ever require customer service regarding a warranty claim, good luck at getting your bag fixed or replaced. I have been dealing with Ricardo for going on 3 months and the only thing they have done is read my emails. When I finally got a response, the customer service rep said he was mailing me a bag of comparable value and quality. I got the bag, however the features of the bag I received as a replacement in no way compare to the bag they know I have. As a result I have a bag that is broken, and now another bag I won't use... I would rather take my chances with another company's products and customer service than Ricardo. Additionally, don't be fooled, Vera Bradley is made by the same company. Check out who you are dealing with before you make the same mistake I did. If there were zero stars I would rate them as zero."
5,Inexpensive and versatile,This tool has been excellent. I needed a drywall/jab saw and bought this tool instead since I figured it would be more useful for other purposes. I've used it for precision cuts of wood in stud bays as well as a drywall saw with just the standard blade and it works great. The only concern I had buying this saw was how tight the blade would fit- the Quik-Lok mechanism is very sturdy and you'd never know you're using a easily replaceable blade.
3,Looks good,"The helmet really completes the outfit but I was kinda disappointed. I thought that it would change your voice when you talked but it doesn't. Also the visor keeps falling off. But overall, he enjoys it. I got a really good deal on this through Amazon and it serves its purpose as a play toy."
2,Great idea but poorly made,"The 3 year old who recieved this gift absolutely loved it but it was enormous! It comfortably fit my husband's head! We were prepared to deal with that by adding weather stripping as indicated in the box. But, the visor broke 30 minutes after he (the 3 year old) began wearing it - and he was not being particualrly rough with it either. If you're going to market something for children, it should fit a child and be sturdy enough to last more than 30 minutes. It's such a great idea and compliment to the astronaut suit, and he did go crazy over it, but for the price, I am dissapointed in the quality of the construction."
3,It's o.k. for a child who enjoys space and astronaut themes.,"I bought this for my 8 1/2 year old son. The helmet itself was huge, can fit an adult with no problems. Because of this, it basically ""floated"" on my sons head. As for the face protector working by a touch of a button and the electronic recording, these were the selling characteristics. BUT, too pricey for not having enough positive things to balance out the negative...not enough to keep a childs interest. My son enjoyed it the first couple of days but has not picked it up since. I also think if it fit better, (had a padded plactic skull frame inside for a snug fit) it would rate better and people wouldn't mind paying the asking price so much."
3,Overpriced!!!,"I bought this to complete a Halloween costume for my 6 year old son. Believe the other reviewers when they say it is huge. There is no way he could safely wear this at a Halloween party or running around trick-or-treating - he can barely walk in the house without bumping into something while wearing it. On the flip side, he does love it and feels like a real astronaut while wearing it so perhaps it will get some make-believe play use. I do have a problem with the price though. The quality of the piece appears to more in the $15-20 range than the $40 range."
2,bobble head,"This helmet is huge. You could have a head as big as Andre the Giant and still fit into this helmet. It makes my son (5.5 yrs, normal size) look like a bobble head. It is so big and clunky that he takes if off after half a minute. He does not play with it at all. We bought it for a Halloween costume (with the white astronaut suit) and the suit is really cute and realistic, but this helmet is definitely not. You can't even hear the sounds unless you are wearing the helmet, so the blastoff can only be enjoyed by the wearer. And that is the only sound, just a countdown and blastoff. No mission control stuff and anything else. Plus the flipping visor comes off a lot. My son has a great imagination and had more fun with a helmet we made from a box (before we bought the helmet) than he did with this helmet. Wish I hadn't bought it, but could not return it after I had opened it."
1,This set won't fit on a H22A Honda Prelude IV VTEC,"I bought this set for a 1995 DOHC VTEC Honda Prelude, I did check on the page and it said it would fit my vehicle but they are not long enough and the wires do not reach the spark plugs connector, too bad because quality seems good."
3,Size Matters,"I have a 38"" waist so your one size fits all average back support just barely fits, always on the verge of popping right off. From my experience XL is the same as getting a one-size. No difference whatsoever. So I thought a 2XL should do the trick. Turns out its WAY TOO BIG! At least from this company. Maybe would start at about 44"" on up."
3,Still good after a few years,"We've had a few of these over the years, and with a map update, still running fine. Although Garmin's map updates are the greatest or accurate most times, Im still missing roads that have been around for years, and these dont allow for any sort of corrections.The handsfree aspect is nice, and the audio player is good, but the FM transmitter is garbage, very underpowered."
1,Garmin nuvi 660 - a bummer,"To pay the price for this GPS and not get routing WITHOUT multiple waypoints is unconscionable. What was Garmin thinking?The routes chosen by the 660 are neither the shortest or quickest, and the FM transmitter is probably there but it does not transmit a signal 4 feet to my vehicle radio antenna. Adding a cheapie third party FM transmitter to the earphone jack gets a good signal to the vehicle radio. The 660's transmitter simply doesn't work.Aside from those short comings the unit works okay. But then so do other competing units and at a much lower price.Keep shopping."
1,La bateria no sirve.,"La publicacion decia ""like new"" La bateria no dura ni un minuto, no sirve la bateria, definitivamente no estaba como nueva ahora tengo que comorar otra bateria"
3,Great GPS While It Worked,"I owned this GPS for a little over four years, and it was a great device. I would give it five stars except that the touch screen recently ceased to work. Since it was a very expensive unit I considered having it repaired, but Garmin no longer supports this GPS model. Now all it amounts to is a hunk of metal ready to go to electronic recycle. I'll probably look at another brand as a replacement."
4,works,This works as adveritised. Holds my Portercable 690 just fine. Kinda a pain to install considering the 2 halves and motor need to be slid into the router lift. But it works just fine.
3,"Fun, but out-dated","When this book and CD combination came out, it was exactly what the hepatitis C community needed. It was fun, hopeful, informative, and unique. Unfortunately, it is now out of date, and although the encouraging message is still current, the treatment choices are not. Thank you, Dr. Challa for your contribution to the hepatitis C community."
1,The Supplier Lies,"While the product is great, the supplier, even though the Amazon web site stated ""in stock"", only sent me 2 of the 6 units that I ordered.While I think Amazon is great, I will never order any product that comes from Ozbo again."
4,Great Idea,I bought this costume for Halloween and it was a great success. Everyone knew who I was and was real original.
2,Tastes bitter,"Mac n Cheese makes a great late night meal, and it's great comfort food. I picked up a couple boxes of the new Organic version, assuming it would taste the same. The first box tasted so bitter that I had to toss it all. I thought maybe I had a bad box, so I gave it another try, but it still tastes disgusting. Has anyone else noticed this?"
4,"Healthy , lightly flavored","I find this product a bit disappointing in the relative blandness of the cheese. However, I did notice the absence of any chemical taste. I wish it had a sharper cheddar taste, however. The taste of the cheese is quite mild. The macaroni is quite light in quality I note."
3,I liked the Aussie hair spray well enough ...,"I liked the Aussie hair spray well enough -- it did hold my style without being too sticky or stiff, but I found the smell to be a little overpowering. At first, it has a fruity smell -- but you can still smell it hours later and it doesn't work well if you're wearing a perfume. I think I'd opt to purchase this spray with an unscented smell. Overall, the hair spray was good for the price."
5,How can Gluey mean boring?,"--It can't. This album is a major step away from their first studio work, inasmuch as it shows more connection to american music roots, and less devotion to total chaos; a good move to some, to me it is good enough that it actually sounds like their stage show (with a little brass-and-atmosphere added)... The first is better, but you need ALL the glue you can get to keep it together in this life... GET some."
3,[...],I was hoping to get the first edition of this book. From what I heard that book really is a lot better. If anyone knows how to buy this book please let me know.
3,Intersting title,Speak and grow rich. An interesting title but I doubt many that read it will actually find that they grow rich without additional help and resources. it was worth reading but not worth raving about.
4,3 songs short of being perfect,"As a huge Adam Ant fan, I not only like the songs that made the Billboard Hot 100, I also like some of his other songs that had videos that were played quite often on MTV and other video outlets, but did not quite make the charts. Those songs are ""Vive Le Rock"" (the follow up to ""Apollo 9""), ""Rough Stuff"" (the follow up to ""Room at the Top""), and ""Won't Take That Talk"" (the follow up to ""Wonderful""). No, these songs weren't huge hits, but his fans know them and love them. For the casual listener who just wants the hits, this CD will suffice. For the hardcore fans, it comes up a little short."
2,cord: his empire his motor cars,"This book is a copy of the original published by Automobile Quarterly Magazine, Kutztown, PA in 1983. This was a limited edition book, a total of 2500 were printed, each with it's copy number, leather bound and slip cased. The book came with a certification from the publisher that the plates had been destroyed with the certification, I believe, filed in the office of the Berks County Prothonotary that this had been done. When the Quarterly was sold to the new owners in Indiana this cheaper copy was produced and should not be compared to the original."
2,Too sweet.,Other artificial sweetners are cheaper and work just the same. This is actually too sweet. I only use a half packet in coffee and that's almost too much.
1,"Drags On, And Is A Bore","""I hate to blasphemy against my favorite author, but I found this third novel in the Psychomech trilogy a complete and utter bore."
2,Poor,This book was a poor attempt at a good book. The scenarios were adequate but didn't last long enough or explore what lies deep in them. It's grammar and dialouge had little interest and the characters weren't developed. It wasn't complete failure- Mike Martines and the career report were over mediocre. I wouldn't reccomend this book unless (as it was for me) the last book rusting away on your shelf.
3,I say it's ok for these reasons,"Pros1) I paid under $10.00 for my green set, they no longer carry.2) It's great for BBQ's which is why I bought it. The knifes that come with it have an edge to cut with.3) It is dishwasher safe, to a degree. Be careful to not let them sit in there very long or they will get rust spots. Also don't use the heat dryer option or they might melt/deform/lose the finish.4) Kid friendly, kids approved!5) They are pretty.Median1) They can be abused, that's ok as they were/are cheap!Con's1) They will not last you a lifetime. These are not the same older style ones they used to make! Be advised.2) They are cheap, they do get bent, they can in fact break with very little use or abuse. They are painted.3) They can be damaged while washing in dishwasher even though they state dishwasher safe.4) Not made for daily use.5) They are made in china, yes they are inferior due to this.More on my post as to why it's inferior.[...]"
5,EXCELLANT CUTTER FOIL SCREEN SAVER,This little plastic cover used to be included with the Braun razor to protect the foil screen. Braun doesn't include it now so if you have a new series 5 Shaver buy it. It does exactly what its supposed to do.
5,Samurai Jack- Master of Masters,What can I say...Jack is back to gack and hack the slack flack mack tack sack named Aku!
4,gaby impresses..,"the new disc shines. when i put it on, i knew i'd dig it. it's very organic in texture yet remains electronic and almost blippy as well. it's as if bjork vacationed in latin terrains and wrote an album. check it out."
1,Not for the legend blade,"THe item i received if a good quality.. maybe not as the original one , but good... the problem is it didn't fit even I measured my blade and measure the original sheath... and the description in lenght was the same as my measure... the product I got is for the smaller multipliers."
2,Didnt do much for me.,I ordered this because I have chronic pain due to sacroilliac joint damage. It doesnt really help for this as it does not actually provide much support. A simple leather weight belt works better for this.
5,Great Item,"My husband loves this, and if I could find out where he hides it, I would borrow it! This is a wonderful item for everyone to have on hand and remember to use."
4,Back Support,I bought this belt for a friend his waist is a 38 and the XL was still just a little snug. Overall a sturdy belt.
5,Love it - long-lasting,"I have easily had this measuring cup for 4-5 years, and it gets very frequent use in my household!The measurements are easy to read either from the top or from the side.Another added benefit is that the handle is perfect for hanging; we have a crock full of our spatulas and other kitchen tools; this handle slips right into the crock and allows the measuring cup to hang off the edge for easy access.Washes up very well in the dishwasher; I was concerned that the letters would wear off with use but so far they are all clear!Would definitely recommend to a friend or buy as a housewarming gift!"
5,Meat order via Amazon,"I ordered these city ham shanks, the large package size, and when they arrived, I was really surprised that theyhad little fat, they are mostly ham that is edible and cooks wonderfully with out a lot of fat grease left.I have used it for beans, cabbage, greens, and am really going to say only this to those of you who read thisreview, you can not beat the quality of the ham shanks, and the price for the large size order, is fantastic.If you like shanks in your greens, beans, give this a try for sure through Amazon."
4,Microsoft Office Standard Student and Teacher Edition 2003,I really enjoy having this edition for Student and Teacher 2003. I am enrolled in an online MBA program and this is a really nice feature to have. Thank you.
5,MICROSOFT WORD,LOVE IT! Use it at home to do work for job. Needed it to be compatible with work software. Makes my life a lot easier. And your price was great! Not to mention your delivery time!
3,"Overhyped, overpriced","Before you spend over $100 on Microsoft Office (MSO), take a look at <http://www.OpenOffice.org>.OpenOffice (OOo), a free of charge product, works like Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. OOo opens and saves documents in Microsoft formats, so you can use your old documents and share documents with MSO users. OOo includes all the features I use (and lots of advanced features too). Our non-profit office uses OOo on 30 computers, and it especially shines on the old Windows 95 computers (that Microsoft Office stopped supporting).I have both Microsoft Office and OpenOffice on this computer, and I prefer OpenOffice.If you don't have a broadband connection to download OOo, buy a book that comes with it. There's a book on Amazon (""OpenOffice.org Writer"") for less than $20 that includes the latest OOo version. You get the book *and* you save $100 compared to MSO. Or buy ""OpenOffice.org 1.1 Resource Kit"" for $40."
4,ventures for the 90's and 00,"after a few listens to this album i've come to the conclusion that this is what the ventures would have sounded like if they had started in the 90's as opposed to the 60's.the melodies are catchy and the lack of drum loops that warp is known for do not detract from this album. its like listening to music that you would have heard as a kid, the sounds are all nostalgic since their repotoire of instruments are from old analogue synths, over all im glad i bought the album,"
1,Had problems from the get go,"Took awhile to try and understand the poorly written owners manual. The quick start manual is useless unless you maybe designed this radio/mp3 recorder. The manual has been updated at the Kaito web site. First problem I had is the mp3 player would not change the bit rate for recording. It was stuck at the lowest quality 32kbps and would not change. Tried contacting customer service on the web site but know one ever answers emails. No tech support either. After using the radio/mp3 recorder for aprox. 5 weeks (recording one show a week for an hour), the light on the mp3 play stopped working. Tried contacting customer service again for warranty service. no reply.Great radio but poor mp3 recorder. I've owned two of these radio and both became useless. They both locked up and became unuseable. No tech support or repair service."
1,Not what is pictured on Amazon,"The appearance of the actual product received is vastly difference than the picture displayed on Amazon. The picture reflects a unit very similar to the charger that was included in the original purchase of the shaver which is made of high quality materials. The charger received is of a different design and lower quality materials.While the charger does work with the shaver, I question the durability of the unit."
1,Just not worth the money,"This software comes as 4 seperate CD's - all are completely unrelated to each other. The gardeners journal is just awful and almost DOS like. Burpee should be ashamed, their web site is so good and the 3D Garden Designer is difficult to use at best. Instant Landscaping is worthless without a photo of your own. I wanted to plan my driveway turnaround on paper - should be easy. There were no trellis's and everytime I tried to view a plant selection, the same plant shows over and over. Don't waste your money."
1,Do NOT waste your time,"Outdated software that doesn't even operate correctly half the time on current Windows operating systems. I tried to contact the publishers and was told that the software isn't even being supported anymore and that I should return it to wherever I bought it...they didn't even try to help me, just told me to return the software! Not worth the money whatsoever."
1,Worst program I've ever bought,"This is suppose to be a new program & it's suppose to be xp compatiable, but the programs are so old, that even the links inside the program are no longer active."
5,This is MUCH better than their studio release,"Ok.. Here it goes..I owned this album and by far it is the best albums that I've heard by AHC and one of the best metal albums I've heard. I've seen AHC in concert at first ave when they were back pushing this album. They were a great act, haven't seen them in years though since they shared the stage with Fear Factory at X-Fest 2001.. but I do know that the material presented here and the method in which it was recorded makes me ""almost"" justify paying the 80 dollars for this. Most of these are re-recorded for ""War of Art"".. eh.. Sorry to say, but all of the re-recorded material sucked major balls compared to what was on this album. The samples, everything.. was so much better on this one. Buy it, download it, whatever.. this is AHC at their best."
3,Edited original 1985 concert,"I started to watch the 1985 concert, and I noticed that they edited a lot of Whoopi's dialogue when she is doing Fontaine. I remember a lot more content than what they are showing on this dvd. I am thinking of writing to HBO and ask why this was done."
4,New favorite,"If you are a be good tonyas fan, you will not be disappointed with this one. First listen, I was worried I might get sick of listening through the album as most of the songs are at slow or moderate tempo. Like Tonya's stuff, this is good singer songwriter material. You are not going to buy this for instrumental virtuosity. Solos are simple, just to add some accents to the good song writing. Instrumental accents include banjo (of course with Trish Klein from the Tonyas, harmonica, clarinet, pennywhistle, and whistling. Allison Russell's vocals are very pleasant, a tad bit more bluesy-jazzy than what you'll find in tonyas vocals. Trish Klein provides nice simple pleasant harmonies as she does with the Tonyas. Good original and catchy songs by the talented duo. Looking forward to hearing their second release."
4,Hand Cramps.,"The clamp is hard to use, but gets the job done. Hair shaving sharp. A side note, the kit comes in a red box, not blue like the picture."
4,Lansky Deluxe 5-Stone Sharpening System,Good sharpening system at a great price. I bought this set for my son. I got my set over 15 years ago. It error-proofs sharpening by setting the angle with the different angle guides. The different grade stones let you quickly move from a course sharpening to fine stones. I actually found a better system... for around $300.
5,"Great kit, exceptional value.","I have sharpened every possible knife in my kitchen because of how awesome this product is.Pros:- Does not require extensive training to use.- Very compact.- Makes my knives sharp. I love cooking, and it's a lot less stressful when you don't have to worry about squishing tomatoes or being able to slice through ALL the green onions... etc.- Pretty colors! Hooray!Con:- Metal handles can come undone from the stones while sharpening, which is easily remedied by re-tightening the screws. Not even gonna deduct a star, because this kit is wonderful!When (if?) these wear out, I will buy an identical set."
5,the Deathstalker saga continues as strong as ever!,"Space opera doesn't get any better than this. With his grand, sweeping style, his memorable characters, his complex and involving storyline, his suspenseful and riveting action sequences, and his absolute mastery of the art of drama, Simon R. Green has truly shaped a masterpiece of modern fiction. Deathstalker War is the third in a series of five, and ends the original war, though it leaves quite enough loose ends for future books. A reader could stop with this book, but who would want to?"
5,"Grammatically there are some issues, but it is still...","A great novel. I first read this six years ago, and it still amazes me. Great job. Also, just a little something to Amazon, why the letter cap on these things, makes a guy not want to leave these."
4,something differnt,i'm always on the lookout for something new. I took a gamble and bought this cd- i am really glad i did. The vocals are soooo unique and it is what sets this groups apart. give them a try. good stuff!
5,this rocks my socks!,I think even though this album is only 2 months old it is underated.this cd is better than the most popular of all emo bands and deserves a pat on the back for there effort. maybe not the most popular band lie mae or matchbook but is truly better in all areas.
4,Modern and melodic,"Power pop songs, disguised as hard driving rock songs thanks to an in your face guitar sound, which is quite heavy in places, all while hook filled choruses flow with a natural ease. The best track on the album is ""Stationary Stationary"" , worth buying the whole album just for this track. Very good, but not quite a classic"
5,Amazing album - You'll never get enough of it,"To describe this album in one word, it would probably be ""Wow"", and that's not giving it half the credit it deserves. Anberlin has released their second album, and it is incredible. Guitars sound pretty freaking awesome, their singer uses a HUGE range in his singing, and thier drums have improved like none other. I got this album two days before it's release date. I've listened to it about 3 times EACH DAY since I got it, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. This is definately one of the best CD's in my collection. Get it or you won't be happy."
5,Where is she?,"I have been looking everywhere for this cd. When I first herd it i was 10 years old, my sister would always play it, (not this particular cd but the very fisr one)and from then on ii love it. It was lost in moving and for some strange reason the internet couldn't find it. But I am so happy that i came here, now that i found it i am never going to let it go. I really wish Milira would come back and grace us with another album."
1,OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FROM BatheAndBeauty,Who is BatheAndBeauty trying to kid? You can get this at a much lower price right here at Amazon. This is an outrageous price for this size bottle. BatheAndBeauty are Greedmongers and no one should be taken advantage of by them. This bottle is worth $20.32 don't spend more on it. Shame Shame BatheAndBeauty.
4,Old good Southern R&R,"Sorry for my english, I'm French but I like the southern R&R. Doc Holliday is very good but don't forget with Lynyrd Skynyrd & Molly Hatchet... Point Blank (1st & sd LP), The Outlaws, 38 Special (Special delivery by exemple), Rossington Collins Band, Johnny Van Zant Band. and other. If you can other group in this style of music, write me..."
1,Boring.,"The only decent movie on here is The Miracle on 34th Street. Not as good as the 1947 version with Natalie Wood, but still not bad. You can also get this 1957 version as Meet Mr. Kringle."
2,Happy Retro Memories,"This 3 CD set is an excellent bargain. It contains many old TV programs and movies relating to Christmas as we all used to know and love it. You will enjoy its drama, humor and heart string pulling for the entire season."
2,The Christmas Collection 36 shows,This was a good DVD if you like very old shows. There were some shows that clearly told the Christmas Story that we had never seen. But there were many that we clicked quickly through because the quality of the piece was so poor.
2,Broke First Time I Used it,"I have used two other small ceramic knives and loved them for cutting fruit and veges, so I bought this larger one. The first time I used it, I was cutting up a chicken and ended up with a big chunk missing from the middle of the blade. I guess I hit a bone, I don't know. That seems like a serious limitation, so I guess I'll stick to my steel knives from now on."
2,Not the best.,This book did not meet my expectations. Contents of the recipes are not organized in a friendly manner. This is the second and last Esther Brody recipe book that will purchase.
5,great music!,Amazon sold this at a great price. this album shows off Shawn's huge range of talent. love the music. love the lyrics. love Shawn Mullins!!
4,Average scanner.,"This scanner seemed a bit bulky when I got it, the CanoScan N1240U Flatbed Scanner only weighs 3 pounds as compared to 9 for this one. It was easy to set up, just installed the software and it was compatible with my Windows XP Professional computer. One of the problems is that everytime you start up the computer, it wants the scanner to be on and the program that opens is annoying if you don't need to use the scanner. There isn't a way to turn this option off so that's a big downfall. Also the program could use some improvements in its interface and ease of use. The scans are great quality but the software could use much improvement and should be plug&play."
3,Unsolved! II: More Famous Real-Life Mysteries by George Sullivan,"The book's publisher is Scholastic. It was a little paperback with a chapter for each mystery, aimed at young teenagers. It told me about the murder I was particularly interested in, with some inaccuracies; but I found that to be true in other sources on the same subject. It does what it sets out to do: amuse a youngster with real-life mysteries. No attempt is made to solve the mysteries or point to a suspect. There were no photographs.Kathy C"
3,Fair,"Contrary to the description, you can't just wash these off.I ended up buying a different brand at Walmart that are less expensive and can be rinsed off and function the same in regards to heat resistence etc."
2,Very Disappointing,"Walter Boyne is an extremely knowledgable person on the subject matter he chooses for this novel. I noted that reviews of the book were uneven, yet I have read both novels and articles written by him and decided to take the chance. Unfortunaetly, my vote is cast with those that were disappointed by the effort. The novel is so poorly strung together with the facts that are being related about the development of jet aircraft, that if it had been written by anyone that did not have Boyne's credentials, it would have been returned by the publisher. There is little point in going through it's weaknesses. It would take too long."
5,Great Compilation of Monk's work,"Really enjoy just sitting down and listening to this broad overview of Monk's work. I play in a good ""big band"" and what a joy it is to listen to his original version of ""'Round Midnight"", ""Blue Monk"" and ""Straight, No Chaser""."
1,Don't waste your time,"After installing everything as instructed, a message to unlock the scanner kept coming up. After numerous attempts of locking and unlocking I checked the website and followed the recommendations there with no success. They don't have a toll free number where you can talk to a representative and you really can't get any help on their website. The scanner looks nice but too bad it didn't work."
3,Somewhat Disappointed!,I was a bit disappointment in this book. It seemed to be very repetitive. It is very sad that it ended with suicide but I found it to a bit boring at time.
1,DANIELLE STEELE,MAYBE THIS WAS JUST ME BUT...... I FOUND THIS BOOK RATHER BORING AND BRAGIDOCIOUS. LET'S HIRE SOMEONE TO BE THE PARENT.....
2,his bright light,this book says more about Danielle Steele than her son's bipolar disorder. Sappy @ times.
3,His Bright Light,"This book was written as a means of therapy for the mother. It was very detail oriented and depicted her struggles throughout his childhood and adolescence. It is a great book for mental health professionals as well as educators, because it gives you signs to pay attention to and depicts the struggles and the frustrations of the parents. It also shows the shortcomings of the legal system in securing treatment for a child who reaches the age of adulthood."
1,"Too Much, But Not Nearly Enough","I wondered while reading if Nick did not live up to the seemingly expected idea of himself. The one his mother seemed to have set early on. Lots in the early part of the book with regards to his early years did not ring true. Some I felt completely unbelievable. I did finish the book, but did not really like it. I felt that something was lacking o missing in this young man's life from the beginning. I would not recommend this book"
5,HIs Bright Light,"I always wanted to read this book, but was unable to find it in paperback and was happy thatit was available on the Kindle. Very interesting story on bi-polar and the effects it has on one'slife. The family did all they could to help him."
5,"Wonderful, Touching, Most incredible, heart wrenching book.",I have been reading Danielle Steel for years. She is one of my favorite authors. But this book takes you to a whole new plane. I have more respect and admiration for Mrs. Steel then I have ever had for anyone. This book take you from laughter to tears. From admiration to complete amazement. This is a book you can't put down.
5,His Bright Light,This book is a real eye opener to those of us that have no way of understanding or dealing with this diease.It helped me to understand what my room mate goes thru as she is bi-polar.. Her up and downs are explained very well in this book... Bless youDanielle Steel for having writing what must have been the hardest book in your life to write... I am terribly sorry for your loss..Linda Crawford
1,disappointing,"Not being a DS reader,I selected this book due to subject matter.An eloquent mothers ode to her troubled child is what I read.So much more could have been said about the illness itself as opposed to a mothers/family pain.Not even mental health resource material at the end of the book.The ""bright light"" was that even with ample resources, mental illness presents a heartbreaking struggle for those loving the afflicted."
2,Not a very good book,"Used it at U of IL for two courses, a basic intro to EM, and a more advanced course in fields transmission lines. For the purposes of an introductory EM class this book is horrible, look elsewhere. Not enough examples and very difficult to read. For the purposes of a more advanced class, it is adequate, but not great."
5,Amazing!!!,"If a song makes you cry, you know its GOTTA be good! This song does just that! The range in Daniel's voice is amazing!"
4,good,this game is pretty good ive played since I got it the action is awesome even though the graphics aren't that good but is better than nothing this game came out when ps3 had just come out but since I got a 360 too why not get it so I got it since it new I wanted it new the game is kinda hard but as a true gamer always needs a good challenge to take it to the next level they should make a stranglehold 2 with much better graphics this game reminds me of Sleeping Dogs you cant drive or fight MMA style but its a shooting game like dead to rights retribution .
4,Strawberry shortcake world of friends,It's a cute movie about making friends even if they are different.
1,Read carefully,Some of the items listed on this page will play in different parts of the world. Not all products make that distinction. BEWARE!
5,A must see for any Madonna fan.,"I felt the video was very good, though I was surprised that all of her music videos were not on here. There were several classic videos missing such as: Crazy For You, True Blue, The Gambler, Who's That Girl, Dress You Up, Into The Groove, Live To Tell and a few others. But despite this, I think the video is worth buying."
