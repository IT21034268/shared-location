3,Fun mystery read,I love mysteries but at times like light reading. This book combines both aspects. It doesn't take a lot of genius to figure out the story line but the characters are fun and likeable. A good read but I am not sure I would purchase all the series for the asking price.
5,Wow,I read the whole book. Have not done that since school '68 will be looking to read another soon as I get a little more time.
4,I am finally reading it,"I do not think I can push to read this any longer, I mean jeez book 17 is out, its a sign that I needed to read this now. I am glad I did, it is a nice break from supernaturals and YA fictions. I was wrong about Stephanie Plum, I was under the impression that she's been a bounty hunter since the beginning and that she has all the martial arts training and kick ass female bravado, so I was so surprise that she is a newbie. The characters in this book, man they are either weird, funny or scary, especially Ramirez, there are no words to describe how horrifying his character is. I think I've been reading too much YA because I got a little shock in the choice of words and environment that Stephanie lives in.Mama Plum and Grandma Mazur is just too funny. While Mama Plum's meddling is intolerable but it gives me great entertainment to read it. I am so impressed with Stephanie. She is funny and witty. I am looking forward for more troubles she gets herself into."
3,Entertaining but not my personal favorite,"This book is a perfect escape novel, a great read for cuddling up by the fire for an afternoon. That being said if you are looking for serious literature this isn't it. It was fairly graphic and if it were made into a movie it would be more in the genre of a thriller cop movie than say a Miss Marple kind of movie. Anyways, this was a fun read and entertaining."
3,Slow to start but gets more interesting as the story unfolds,"Stephanie Plum is short of cash, so she goes to work, for her cousin, as a bounty hunter. The story was hard to get into, but as I read further, I began to like Stephanie (and especially Stephanie's grandmother) and became interested in what would happen next."
2,"Not all readers like it, though","This book was recommended to me at a bookstore that specializes in mysteries, and I have a hard time understanding why. The characters are largely stereotypes, and the result reads more like a Hollywood treatment of a mystery than a novel. The background for the plot centers on bail bonds, but provides little detail beyond what one could glean from watching a good movie like ""Midnight Run."" I notice that many of the (extemely positive!) reviews here are written by people who begin by saying ""I don't like mysteries, but. . . "" Well, I can see where that might be the case, and respect their opinions (with the one exception that I can't understand the positive comments on the ""romance"" in the book because it is so preoccupied with sexual violence). But as someone who loves this genre, this book struck me as an unsuccessful attempt at marrying Robert B. Parker and Sue Grafton."
4,"Fast pace, serious, but with a sprinkling of humor","I have read just about all the books in the Plum series, but somehow I missed the first book. I do remember that I really enjoyed ""Two for the Dough"" so I started dropping hints that I wanted this book for my birthday present and low and behold I got my birthday wish. I wasn't disappointed in this book even though it had a real frightening character in the story. Still there were many scenes where I found myself laughing, i.e, the car problems and the family and many other scenes. It humorous and serious and all in all just a wonderful story."
5,"Cute, Fun, Quirky","I am a lover of the Sue Grafton series and find that these books are similar but with more sass and sarcasm. My book club actually picked this title for our Oct 2012 selection. We will be heading to a cabin for the weekend and plan to watch the movie after we discuss the book.Note - this isn't a cozy mystery. There is one bad guy you'll wish dies a slow death.The minute I finished this book I wanted to rush out a get #2. That deserves five stars.This is a fun read for people who like clever, witty female characters. If you find yourself cheering for the underdog, then Stephanie Plum will hear you loud and clear."
5,I'm hooked!!,"Can't believe I just started to read this series. Consider me joining the league of Stephanie Plum's fan. This book is such a winner!! I can't believe that somebody is able to write such a fantastically hilarious book in first person point of view but this book sure proves I'm wrong. Can't wait to start reading the next book in the series (already in my bookshelf) to meet crazy Stephanie, yummy Joe Morelli, and tough-guy Ranger ..."
4,Intriguing,"One for the Money was a book chosen in my book group. I had read another Evanovich that I wasn't impressed with but this was a delightfully different experience. From the beginning I wanted to continue to read.This was also the first book I read on Kindle. One for the Money was a great introduction to a wonderful system. It held my place, went back and forth so easily.I am looking forward to continuing the series, it was so intriguing!"
4,Easy read in a series,"I enjoyed the story, but I wouldn't have minded if the profane language had been left out. I found it to be unnecessary to the actual story."
5,Two of the best,"I never enjoy a book fully when I don't care for the side characters. This series has two of the best: Rex, the hamster, who knows to enjoy a night on the wheel, and Grandma Mazur with her quirky sense of humour. I love them to bits."
2,Implausible Plum,"I didn't like this book. I didn't hate it by any means--I thought it was good enough--but I did not like it. The characters were kind of fun, and it was an easy read. It was also a bit of a page-turner. On the other hand, the main character was utterly and unbelievably dense. I saw nothing romantic about Joe, a guy who molested Stephanie when she was six and took her virginity at eighteen (then never talked to her again and spread rumors about it). I, personally, would probably not make-out with a child molester/player/murderer (but I guess that's just me). Also, were a known rapist and sexual torturer calling me regularly to tell me he was going to rape me, I probably would call the police and not spend all my time alone. Stephanie Plum did the opposite, and somehow the rapist decided not to rape her on her daily early morning jog . . . alone. In short, the book had mostly implausible characters."
4,Loved It,"After several friends had recommended this series, I finally got on board and was not dissapointed. Great lite reading. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Comedic mystery with entertaining characters."
4,Fast moving action,"The first novel in the Stephanie Plum series. Stephanie lost her job, had her car repossessed, has hocked or sold most of her belongings, has an empty refrigerator, and has been reduced to sampling the food she bought for her pet hamster. She obtains employment with her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, by threatening to tell Vinnie's wife about the duck (this is left to the reader's imagination). She is now a bounty hunter, and her first assignment is tracking down a man with whom she has a love/hate relationship.Stephanie is from a working class family in New Jersey, with an odd assortment of relatives and friends, some of whom pop in and out of the story. The novel has its moments as she is stalked by an insane prizefighter who likes to hurt women, has attempts on her life, and bumbles into some major crime. Things work out, more or less, in the end as she picks up some injuries along the way. The future looks bright for Stephanie and her hamster, and the series continues."
3,Plum Dissapointed,"I was so looking forward to these books as nice light summer read. The books got stellar reviews so I figured there must be something to all the hype. I got through One for the Money and admit I was drawn in at times, the book definitely does not drag and it does have its chuckle to yourself moments. I just didn't think it was that funny or that good to warrant such praise. The goofy humor that is in this book, like when Stephanie lets her senile grandma play with her gun at the dining room table and grandma shoots a hole in the chicken did not seem to jive with the brutal violence depicted in scenes. I even willed myself into the second book because I was sure at any moment the ""magic"" was going to sweep me off my feet and suck me in. It just never happened for me. Not a bad book but just so-so in my humble opinion."
2,Not the greatest mystery writer,"This was the first Evanovich mystery I read, having only recently come to mystery book from literary fiction. The story was only mildly interesting to me and I much prefer other mystery authors."
2,Not Seeing It,"From reading others' reviews I can tell that the character of Stephanie Plum is appealing to some; unfortunately, she was more appaling to me. Stephanie never manages to grab my sympathy, and being forced to read descriptions of a rapist's work without ever getting good development of the plot makes this book a disappointment. Too bad, from everyone else's reviews, I thought I'd really enjoy this. Needless to say, there are much better books out there, and I won't be reading the rest of this series!"
2,Pregnancy Wedge Pillow,"I found that this pillow was not soft enough to adjust to the weight of my pregnant stomach, so as I leaned into it on my left side at night I felt it lifted me way too much and I could not really adjust it.I also tried it behind my back just to help me not roll around in the bed that is a better use for it I guess but would not buy it again."
2,My bad,I thought it was bigger. I wanted it to prop myself up when on my back. I should have looked at the size before ordering.
4,This pillow helps,This pillow does help when your belly feels heavy and pulls when you are trying to rest on your side. I have trouble sleeping with it for some reason although the bigger I get the more helpful it is. I need more support than just for the belly so I have preferred sleeping with a body pillow. I was a bit disappointed with how small it is. I was hoping that it would be wider so that I could use it to sleep off center on my back as well. But it is helpful and every bit of help makes a difference!
4,Good pillow.,The wedge shape and smaller size work well for under tummy support when you're lying on your side. It works fairly well between your knees but can easily slip out. The removeable cover launders well.
1,NOT What I Expected,"The pillow is too small, I tought it was bigger. After a couple of days of use it started to loose its firmness and now after a month of use it is basically starting to look flat. I don't recomend it."
1,disapointing,This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.
3,OK pillow,"It's a little stiff and the material is rough, so I never actually used it. It seems like a versatile design. I'm hoping to find a use for it later."
5,Perfect for Beginner,"This is a great book. Just perfect for a beginner. I knew nothing about programming. After reading the first chapter I was able to create a Picture Viewer in Visual C# Express. At the end of every chapter you build a cool application or game. You not only learn how to use Visual C# Express but also C# the language. Highly recommended for the ""Absolute Beginner""."
3,OK for the beginners,"I read this book sometime ago and its an ok reference for beginners. It was easy to read and easy to understand (maybe because I have some solid understanding in programing but I doubt a complete beginner will understand everything).Good examples (step by step), good tips...point to the right direction... my interest was kept the whole time"
1,Does not work well.,"I bought this pump thinking that an electric one would be better than a hand pump and that a double one would also be faster to use. I was wrong. When I purchased this as a first time mother, I really did not know what to expect...I found it uncomfortable and after two weeks - one side broke. I received another one and in a month the same thing happened to the second pump...one side broke as well. I gave up on this pump and bought the hand held Advent Isis. I am so thrilled with the Advent hand pump - it is unexpectedly easy and comfortable to use. A good breastpump makes breastfeeding easier - get a hand pump."
1,USELESS,This product is USELESS. IT is not customer friendly. I hate it and I cant believe I paid money for this. For the future MOM dont get this product it is a waste of money.
3,THIS IS NOT ONE OF LORI FOSTERS BEST BOOKS,"I have read all of Lori Fosters books and I have to admit this one did not impress me. I did like story of Annie and Guy, it was romantic and cute. However, Messing around with Max was rediculous and unrealistic. I didn't even care for the dog in this story and I love dogs! Would suggest you buy this book only if you can get it real cheap! If not don't waste your money!! Spend it on Lori's other books that deserve five stars!"
4,Historical Romance with a twist,"Without giving away the plot, I'll say I enjoyed the way this book had a twist that, although I saw it coming, was surprising for your average historical fluff."
3,Through a glass darkly,"I like historical fiction and this held my interest however it had too many long biblical references for my taste. Should be marked ""Christian Historical Fiction""."
4,RAY CHARLES IN HISTORY,"This is rates as an historical collection of a cross over genre in any Ray Charles collection, whilst low on contemporary base notes it still holds its own in relation to a collection that covers an extensive period of time. It is a collection that you can play to a variety of generations of music lovers as it tells the stories that interests all. I believe time will prove this is a set you will never regret having."
3,read this only if you're familiar with Chomsky's works,"While reading this, I got the feeling that the publisher decided to rush it into production right after 9-11. The book is a series of transcripts taken with Chomsky about the events of 9-11. The questions themselves are generally disconnected, and Chomsky often answers by referring to some of the other books he wrote (which was of no help to me, since I hadn't read any of them). There is nothing in the way of a comprehensive analysis of the events. No good argument about why it happened or what we can do.Having said that, the book does present a few interesting ideas. Chomsky refutes the popular idea that the attacks were due to globalization, and offers supporting evidence in a few places. So if you're interested in that, you can get the book. And for the rest of us, if we haven't read anything of Comsky prior to this, we needn't bother."
2,Careful,"People need answers for problems they don't understand. They need comfort. Much of his factual information is incorrect, or at least estrimated wrong, but that's not the point. Why did he write it? Let's just put this succinctly.Chicken Soup For the American Soul this is NOT."
1,Tasteless,"Unbelievable that this was publsihed less than a month after the tragedy. Clearly very little thought or work was put into it. The author should be ashamed of himself for trying to capitalize on the tragedy to try to put forth his narrow point of view.The format is also cheap as ""interview's"" , like anyone would ever want to hear this old throwback mindlessly ramle on a subject he knows nothing about."
1,Chomsky is total disinfo,"Look up the ""5 Dancing Israelis"" and Building 7. It's called controlled opposition, disregard and find out the real truth about 9/11."
5,Gotta love Mickey,"I recieved this as a gift for Christmas from my assistant. I have to admit I am usually a person that likes the cute little watches on women, but once I wore this I LOVED it. It's actually very lightweight and comfortable. I end up forgetting that it's one. I LOVE this watch so much!"
1,Defective Product,"Leaked everywhere badly, required a lot of phone calls, wouldn't give refund, referred to someplace else, initially bought 2 units, was sent extra washers after complaint, still leaked, they requested I upload photos to prove, I didn't have digital camera at time, was finally sent 2 more units, got 1 to work, the other gave me trouble, practiced with water so as to not waste gas, may have gotten second to work but I don't have very much confidence in it, may still go back to old cap, sick of making calls, purchased nearly a year ago."
2,No Confrontation at all,"There is no doubt that both of them are well-educated gentlemen. This destory the whole purpose of the book - they are too polite to have any confrontation. Throughout the whole book, they are just presenting each other their own views. They actually haven't met each other to have a discussion and in fact, the title of the book misled me. It should be called ""Belief or Non-Belief: Some Correspondences"""
1,Disappointment,What a rip off! You can't try the cars out in the blister pack and when you get it home you find out that the water level does NOT rise and fall....there is no water in the tanker so it is a very very expensive nothing.
1,inaccuarte overview of celtic mythology,its a waste of money. i own several celtic mythology books. this one is poorly organized and only gives summaries of the myths. not good. would not buy again. there are better books out there.. oh and comparing it to the Egyptian Book of the Dead is just misleading. One thing good about it is the pictures are very pretty. kids will love that part.
2,Mädchen Amick is hot,Mädchen Amick is hot - pretty face -- but it takes more than a beautiful face to make a great movie. This is a light movie - first 20 minutes are fascinating but then it's downhill and good for a fast forward.
3,OK Movie...GREAT Acting by Amick,"I saw this movie last night just out of nowhere because I like James Spader as an actor. Of course he did a phenomenal performance in this movie, but the actual movie was pretty played out. We've seen this plot line before! Guy meets girls, guy falls in love with girl, girl turns out to have a shady past and turns out to be a psychopath! Yada yada yada! The ending did sort of surprise me though...but Amick was amazing in this movie! This was my first time seeing her and she plays one of the best cold-hearted (actresses) I have ever seen on the screen! I would only recommend this movie if you like James Spader as an actor. Other than that...just let it sit on the shelves."
5,Great watch for the price,"After I recieved this watch I set it right away the instructions were in plain understandable directions. It has kept perfect time with no let up. The only thing about this watch was the band, if you have a large wrist it is uncomfortable to wear. My recomendation is change the band to a adjustable sport strap it is very comfortable to wear on your wrist. All in all a great work or whatever social function watch. The packaging on this watch was top notch. I was very well impressed with the quality workmanship of this time piece. I give this watch a thumbs up.For everyones eyes to read"
1,Glitzy illustrations NOT enough,"Yes, the pictures are nice.But as a useful resource on a trip, this book was amazingly deficient.Major destinations are inadequately covered, while more minor ones are discussed in detail. The Lonely Planet guide was infinitely more useful and informative."
4,there IS fusion beyond Miles Davis,"For a mere 6 or 7 bucks, you can buy this album, a compilation of tracks that originally appeared on the Muse label in the 1970's, edited and sequenced by Mocean Worker to expand on the funk and textures inherent in the original recordings. And what results is a picture of fusion that is simultaneously melodic and funky, spacy but arranged, and almost never easy. Yet it doesn't really sound much at all like the music of Miles Davis during the same period, and that's a compliment, only because most non-Davis fusion I had heard before this was either incoherent or begging for the pop charts. Plus it's refreshing that most of these tracks have no guitar, putting them closer to a gospel/African/soul base but with avant-garde touches, all with thick, warm sound."
1,"Poorly written, poorly organized, and incomplete.","I was quite disappointed with _Database Systems_. I had expected a clear, concisely written encyclopedia of all things relational. What I got was a poorly (and ambiguously) written tome that is rife with Britishisms (who the hell calls rows 'tuples' and tables 'relations' anymore???), that is missing a fair amount of critical information, and that commits the cardinal sin of a reference book -- it is BADLY INDEXED.For 61 bills you could do a lot better elsewhere."
5,Good results,My Dr. suggested this for my ongoing heartburn problems and I have had very good results with it. Good to be able to purchase it at a sale price.
2,Outdated information,"Since the powers that be have now decided to divide the earth's salt water into 5 oceans, the 5th being below 60 degrees latitude, the title and information in the book are outdated and should be revised."
5,Give it a shot. It's very funny.,"This film is low budget and is obviously the work of people with little feature length production experience, but the Character development is very strong. The story line and plot are solid. The story does not waver or get lost as you might extpect from a low budget film like this. Very competent work from that perspective. Also, It is very funny. And I'm not easily amused. Some really classic stuff. Don't let this movie pass you by."
1,Could've been written by a fifth-grader,This book was painfully boring. I honestly believe a young student could have written it. The subject had potential but was squashed immediately. One of only a few boooks I wish I never read.
2,"great 1st chptr, terrible 160 pages or so, good last few pgs","this book is WEAK. a cool story but written with a formula we already know; the reader always feels ahead of the game... and it becomes unbearable. It's an easy read, accessible to younger and infrequent readers and even might facilitate some good discussion, but it's nothin' to write home about. Examples of strong, proud and heroic, african americans are plentiful in our history, with voices worth listening to, so skip this glossy, over-simplified, book for something true and well-written."
4,Powerful,"Extraordinary story with a clear message of self-discovery in a very unlikely way. While the narrative is immensely well written, I found the vernacular overly burdensome at some points. Yet I would recommend the book and view it as an American Classic."
4,A lesson Before Dying,"A Lesson Before DyingEvery Day people are accused of doing something they didn't do, but back in the early days black people got accused of everything. White people thought that since the black people were black they weren't completely human. In Jefferson's case they had seen him not as a man but a hog. In the final words of the trial the lawyer said ""he's just a hog.""When someone looses there faith they tend to say they are lost. Grant said to the priest ""I am lost and you can't expect me to tell Jefferson to believe when I don't."" He also told the priest he needs the radio more than God because he let this happen.The Priest said to Grant, ""You think your educated because you went to collage, but don't know ant thing about your own people you are not educated when you are in hell your so called education won't mean a thing."" it means that even if you know things from books you still have to know god and the people you are around daily to make a difference."
4,S. Kitley,I thought the book A Lesson Before Dying was good because it kept me interested and wanting to know what that lesson was going to be.I think girls and boys would equally like this book because it has good emotion. I liked the book but in some spots it was slow paced but it was worth reading on.
4,Liked it a lot.,I read this little devil in less than a day. I found myself wavering between wanting to slap the main character for his stubborn arrogance and the urge to pat him on the back for his sensitive and probably accurate assessment of the state of the black male psyche in that time period. I couldn't put it down and even called in sick to work so I could finish it. The ending took my breath away. Oprah's done it again.
2,"Dull, Dull, Dull . . .","This book is page after page of description that have no revelance to the plot. Had to be read for an English class, and I literally threw it across the room when I was done. The only part I came close to liking (the reason for the 2 stars), was when they were bringing in the electric chair and showing the townpeople's reactions. That was neat. Other than that, I had to force my way through."
1,I just didn't get it.....,"I didn't like the character Grant, nor did I particularly feel captivated by his perception of events. I found him to be very troubled, abusive, especially towards his students, and apathetic towards the whole situation. I didn't like the book. It just seemed strange to me that an entire book could be written about a remark made in a courtroom. Pass the salt."
4,A Lesson Before Dying,"This book, by Earnest Gains, has very good meanings to it. The lesson that is taught before Jefferson dies can apply to anyone. You think that you are helping someone and you are really helping yourself in the long run.I really never would have picked this book to read on my own, yet I am glad that I have read it. To me, it makes you appreciate life more. It makes you see the things that you thought did not matter matter. I really did enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,NOt Bad,"Although the novel never bored me, it didn't move me with great force either. Actually, the book didn't get very interesting until the last 3 chapters. It wasn't until Jefferson opened up by way of his notepaad that I started to really feel for him. Very well written. . clear, concise prose. That alone makes this a quick read worth the effort."
2,Cannot Recomend,I was dissapointed after reading this book. An entire page and 1/2 about a christmas pagent!!! I very was frustrated. The idea and real story of the book was intersting. But I felt let down after reading the book. I have read other books Oprah has recomended and have enjoyed all of them until this one.
3,Deals with the most critical issue of uour century,"This novel discusses on of the most critical issues of our century. This books seems a little slow from the start, but as the the reader moves on he or she learns much about the iner feelings of the characters. The characters in this novel have many different motivations for what they do. Miss Emma the main character wants her grandson to be a man when he is to die by electricution. this is important because If Jefferson becomes a man then the white man will have won,a nd continued the years of oppression. Jefferson's manhood will be used for freedom"
2,I missed something here too obviously,This is starting to get a little too predictable. Oprah seems to be picking similar books and it's starting to wear on me. I will read this again just because everyone seems to like it so much but after all the hype I don't know. I didn't like Grant as a character or a man and that is a real problem when he is the main character in the book. The story is there but something isn't. Maybe it was me I don't know but this was disappointing.
2,Straight,It was straightAnd boring I wouldn't hand pick this to read didn't catch my attention like that but thanks
2,Not for a 16 year old!,"""A Lesson Before Dying"" Began with a fantastic foundation, a man allegedly murders three people during a robbery and is now on death row. This is the type of story any junior in high school would crave to read, including myself. Then the actual story begins and completely bores any reader my age to sleep. Grant criticizes society and dreads being treated like an inferior thus giving the novel a theme. The issue of injustice and facing responsibility is a great subject matter to base a book upon, until an adolescent must read it, which is then that the book falls out of play. This novel by Ernest J. Gaines is written with precision, consideration and righteousness and would be considered a magnificent novel by many full-fledged persons, but the second it enters the hands of a 16year old, is the second it is set down never intended to be picked up again."
3,"Easy read, but no character development","The prose of the book is fantastic. Except for Jeffersons journal, wish it could of been done differently. The characters, in my opinion were the same as when the book started. The only one who seemed to be moved by this experience was Paul, the deputy."
3,A Lesson Before Dying,"A Lesson Before Dying is about an African-American man named Jefferson who is falsely accused of murder and is jailed. He is sentenced to death by electric chair and is called a ""hog"" by the judge. After Jefferson's grandmother, Miss Emma, hears what the judge says, she asks Grant Wiggins, an elementary school teacher, to help her grandson die with dignity. Grant refuses to help Jefferson, but changes his mind after seeing Miss Emma sad and depressed. Jefferson refuses to accept Grants help at first, but after repeated visits both become friends. A Lesson Before Dying is a good book, but I did not find it to be very interesting. There was not much going on in the story and there was no action whatsoever. This is a great book if you want to read about how events in life can change a person or what life was like for an African-American in the 1940's."
1,Funny-Lookin Tots Don't Know How to Sing!,"Okay, now my cousin has this CD. And after listening to it, let me tell you, I do NOT suggest you buy it! All the songs are repetitive, and the tunes sound so familiar... They may be cute little kids, but they CANNOT SING!"
5,Great gift for the kids!,"Yikes! This is a totally great CD. And I hear they got that football song on the RADIO! Get this for your preschooler... I'm sure he/she will love it. Go and buy it today! I got it for my 3-year-old, Nick. He loves it! Especially Football All the Way! I can't say enough good stuff about these great kids!"
1,No Review,Can't review a product that I never received. Very disappointed that an order placed before Christmas has yet to arrive. I have a very disappointed granddaughter who will not receive her doll.
3,Flocabulary,A fun way to introduce new words in the classroom! Students learn the new vocabulary by hearing the words in the context of current music trends.
2,What's with the noise?,"The pictures in this book are great for my 1 year old son. He can easily spot the fire truck, taxi or police car, etc. But the description for this book was misleading. From reading the editorial review, I expected a different sound when pressing the ""tire"" on each page. Instead the noise generated was unrecognizable and the same, no matter what page you are on. I thought my book was defective. I would have returned it but my son likes it just the same."
4,Have a hankie handy,"Jill Henry can write to pull at your heartstrings--you'll need a hankie for the emotional ending.Jill's writing seems to be a little less sure when it comes to plotting. Hannah's Heart seems to be made up of two unrelated plots, neither of which could have carried the book alone. She seems to have stuck them together, one after the other. That said, however, the story is still a good read worth 4 stars."
4,freebie,"An interesting, funny story about an uncle and his nephews. Their antics are typical of boys and how they lead their uncle to love. A good read for a freebie."
4,though not complete yet...,"Well, if you are a Fringe lover, you will love this too. Great audio and video just like everything else I have had from Amazon."
3,"What Happened to the ""Fringe"" of a few seasons back?","I've never been one to get hooked on sci-fi and fantasy but there was something about Fringe that got me hooked on the show. I couldn't wait to see what kind of anomaly they would investigate next. I eagerly awaited each new season. When they introduced the alternate world, I didn't really like that they were spending so much time on it but i still enjoyed watching the show. Then came season 5. I won't say much about it so as not to spoil it for others but, like so many other shows of this genre (ex: ""Lost"") they seemed to have gone in a direction that they couldn't recover from (in part I'm referring to The Watchers).Overall, I still like the show because of the main characters but I miss the Fringe of the first three seasons."
3,good but not like previous seasons,"While this season, the last so I have read, is good, it lacks the interesting story line of previous seasons."
3,The final future,I like the concept but not the execution. It doesn't feel right. There are some great moments but for the most part I'm unimpressed. I'm hoping it picks up before the end.
1,A shame,The 5th season its very good but It's a shame that the 1 - 3th seasons have Portuguese subtitles and the others not
1,Quality is terrible,"The qualityof the streaming video is terrible. It's very pixelated and blurry, even in the HD setting. The show itself is interesting enough, but I would not recommend streaming it on Amazon instant video. A complete waste of money."
5,Fantastic,Watch it! See for yourself! My review will not do it justice. Best show I've seen so far of this sort.
5,Best show ever!,This show is excellent! Have been a fan since it started back in 2008 and am sad to see it end.A must see for any sci-fi fan or if you just want to watch a smart engaging show!
2,Poor.,"I think the older seasons are far better than this latest one. The stories are poor and I am 4 episodes in, still not sold on the story."
5,Don't let the whiplash get you on the way out.,"This series is terrifically complex and satisfying. The science is mostly garbage, but I haven't found that hampering my enjoyment of the team and the way they work together. The new events in this fifth, final season are still keeping me on the edge of my seat every episode!"
4,Good wrap up season,Enjoyed the finale as everyone ended up just where they needed to be to save the world. We watched the whole series on Amazon Prime.
5,"Love, hate, love","When the series began I loved the varied challenges faced by the team each week. When the alternate universe story line was brought in I stopped watching the series. A year later a friend told me I had made a mistake so I bought the season I had missed and was amazed. I hadn't given it a fair chance. Now I'm addicted to the show and will miss it terribly when the season ends. Great cast, great characters and great story line."
3,Don't taste as good as I hoped,"For a vegan version these aren't too bad. Kind of like a disappointing Laffy Taffy (not as sweet, and less appealing texture."
5,Calcium Chews,"If you're tired of swallowing pills, try these chewable calcium supplements. I like them because they are not chocolate, but fruit."
2,Waste of money,"I stopped reading it after the first hundred pages. After that I just jumped to the last 2 chapters to see what happened, but I really didnt care anymore.I read Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" years ago and loved it. When this book was touted to be similiar to 'Fahrenheit', I expected another interesting romp. Boy, was I wrong.The only saving grace was its alternate chapters where we can read of the early days of the anti-old art movement (which is why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1). But even that didnt hold my attention long.If I can only use one word to describe the book, it would be:- BORING."
2,Good candidate for deletion,"Certainly, there are elements of Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams and Terry Gilliam in this book, but this is less like a story and more like a collection of interesting elements. The plot gets more and more nonchalantly weirder to the point of absurdity, so I was able to skim the last 50 pages without any worry that I'd miss anything important. I believe that the book could be improved by moving the interspersed ""history lesson"" to an appendix rather than forcing the reader to wade through it on the chance there's something interesting within."
4,"Great Recipes, impossible ingredients","I can't make most of the recipes in this book without resorting to mailorder from La Tienda. I'm not living in the complete middle of nowhere, but a town of 100,000 is not large enough to stock things like monkfish or spanish chorizo or any of the other dozen essential ingredients Andres uses. He doesn't acknowledge that any of his essentials might be rare, and so never indicates alternative ingredients.The book itself, of course, is great. It's written with great clarity and humor, and the interstitials that introduce each ingredient are great. The recipes are easy to follow, once you find the ingredients."
5,Loved this book!,"My children and I loved this book and read it when we went through our move. It is not comparing moving to Jesus' death, but to the fact that He left Heaven to come to a new home. It helps a child understand that he is not alone and that even Jesus had been through this tough change. That was actually my very favorite part of the book and brings tears to my eyes when I get to that part. I am buying this book for a friend that is moving - her children are having a tough time with it and I thought they would find it comforting, as my children did."
1,Beware non-Christian followers!,What a suprise to buy what I thought would be a cute book for my 3-1/2 year old neice who is moving to a new house and instead find 3/4 of the way into the book that it is about Jesus! For those that are not of the Christian faith... beware!
2,"Autumn and Tom and Bobby and Sly , are gone","Horrible record and really lack luster interpretations except for a couple. I mean with Ron and Sal been the songwriters they were, why do Louie Louie ??????? Makes one wonder if Warner who released some great obscure albums in this period really knew what they had :( I'd re-release it as Beau Brummel's 666 as its in the bottom of hell on their recorded output :("
3,"Discerningly written, intelligent novel","This is an amazing look into the life of a young widow in the mid-1700s. She is left a ""Widow's Share"" of her husband's estate, which equates to one-third portion for her use, but no ownership. She copes with the realities of her share. She learns to make new choices and decisions, and finds her own place in life. The harsh treatment of her by her relatives does not destroy her hope for her future. Instead she is instilled with a strength that she never knew she possessed. She lives by her own set of rules that are not always accepted by others, yet in her heart she is content to follow her own path. This is a discerningly written story that will open your mind to life in a different time."
2,femme fatale,"It would have been good historical fiction if the main character was not such a femme fatale. a little too unbelievable, her actions and her morals. Really a disppointment."
4,scorpgemi,"I don't own this comp. I'd like to but for the price I'd just as quick pick up something else. I'd like to point out that many of these tracks can be had on the ""Best Of"" comp for Scorpgemi Records. If Disco Juice has the tone of that comp then if might be worth it. I'm going to wait though."
1,Don't buy from college books direct,"After ordering, I received a refund the next day. What is up with that?"
3,a bundle of earlier work - fuzzy,"Its easy for Silverberg to skip through the history, changing the facade to fit the ""Roma"" title. Aah generally I am very disappointed in this work. Nothing exciting. I gave it 3 stars ONLY for the attempt, not the result.."
4,Beautiful photography ... but where are these sites???,"A pretty complete review of the best diving sites around the island with exceptional photographs.It is really a shame that the author did not provide the GPS coordinates information which he refers to on page 9. That would make it an outstanding value!!!José AmadorAguadilla, Puerto Ricoe-mail: casagra2@caribe.net"
5,"The Beutiful Song of Christina Aguilera ""Genio Atrapado""","Good really, for the person that he likes the Latin music this excellent one the c.d ..A my I like it is the music in English, but like I am superfan of Christina Aguilera I decided to buy it since. she didn't find it in another side... For Christina it is that I give him 5 stars but neither is deserves it the other ones they are a music dirt.. Les recomiendo ""Genio Atrapado"""
1,Soap Opera in a Box,"To her credit, Trollope does give us insight into the isolation and invisibility of the life of a rector's wife in a small town in England. However, most of her characters are not developed, so that there are no grounds for the actions they take. The tidy way she gets Anna out of her troubles in the end could land her a job writing for ""The Young and The Restless""."
5,Amazing and Moving Stories,"I remember seeing the Black Jack series years ago at a con I was at, and from that moment on I was hooked. I searched for the comic books, which are rare and hard to find, and I ordered the original Mangas when they were first released in the states, but the copying of the art was shoddy, and the translations were terrible. When I heard that they were re-releasing the Mangas I was delighted. As soon as I got my copy I knew I would be pleased. The page spacing is perfect for the artwork, the translations are wonderful, and I am happy to see this beautiful example of Japanese manga released in a format that will apeal to American and European readers. The stories themselves show a deep and probing knowledge of the human heart and psyche, and each story helps you look into the choice between right and wrong. In anycase, after several decades, this is still an amazing series whith a rich and deeply developed plotline, and this edition truly does it justice!"
3,THE THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMMEND IT TO ANY RACING FAN FROM WAY NBACK WHEN,,,,"
3,FRONT HOOD COVER.,"LOOKS NICE,FITS GREAT! THE PROBLEM IS IF THERE IS ANY WIND,SUCH AS WHEN YOU DRIVE! THE COVER LIFTS IN THE MIDDLE.WHAT I DID WAS TO TAKE THE COVER TO A FRIEND WHO HAS AN AUTO SEAT COVER SHOP AND HAD HIM CUSTOM MAKE A CENTER SECTION."
1,Don't let the green water get the best of you!!,"This stuff is SCARY!! Despite following the directions closely for a 7000 gallon pond with Koi over 15 years old alongside babies that are 2 years old, this stuff cleared the water but made my koi über ill. They hugged the bottom motionless and would not eat for days. My quest for clearer water will not include this product despite its positive reviews and the label's directions/claims. I'm now looking into a natural algae-eating bacteria that is suppose to help. Also, I'm improving my filtration system in general. What's the point of keeping koi if you risk them dying every time you use this product? I don't understand all the positive reviews. They give you a false sense of security in my opinion. This product needs to be pulled off the shelves."
4,algaefix safe for fish?,"I tried this product recently in 2k gallon pond with very small goldfish and some 4-5 inchers. One day after application I found many dead smaller fish but so far the larger fish seem okay. Some small fish were swimming in a cork screw pattern. I'll continue to monitor its safety. However, it does seem to result in the most amazing water clarity. To me this is the Holy Grail of water gardening, so I hope to learn how to use Algaesafe over time since green water sucks."
1,don't use!,"Algae fix, is a horrible fish murdering product. No one should sell this product - nightmare stories all over the internet and now a nightmare in my tank! My Fish are still very very sick days after using less than the recommended dose. I had to remove my guppies within minutes as the looked half dead, several hours later all my other fish became very ill. I performed a 50% water change and 30 hours later my fish are still twitching and won't eat. They almost appear to be blind. Oh my water is crystal clear but who cares about the water if the fish die! Google Algae Fix dead fish - this has happened to many users of this product!"
2,A disappointing Cohen film.,"Larry Cohen usually made entertaining movies based on interesting concept, and there's nothing wrong with the concept here; a film director makes a movie about the murder that he himself committed. Unfortunately, a good idea isn't enough to make a good movie and the script here is much below average for Cohen and the pace is much too slow. The soundtrack distracts from the suspense rather than add to it. Don't bother with this movie unless you feel you need to see all of Larry Cohen's movies."
5,great album,"all of these songs are amongst the bands strongest.Avon is a track that has appeared in three different forms on two different albums, and is one of their best songs.No one knows however is an outstanding track with just the right elements of what makes a great stoner rock song.Too bad these guys broke up."
1,Terrible- So Astonishingly Terrible,"This has to be on the list of one of the WORST 10 books I have ever read. I had to force my way through it because I was on vacation and didn't have another option during my down time. I was greatly disappointed as was the friend who passed it on to me. We both concur that one doesn't give a damn about these characters, mostly because the way their lives come together is highly improbable and unrealistic. Alexis' relationship with Goyo...? Come on... not even in the movies. How contrived were these characters' situations!!! If you're looking for a novel that is forced and trying much too hard to appear like a good read, this is it. My only consolation is that I didn't pay for the book myself. I can only wonder if this this book was published in a hurry, or if there was a blind editor on hand. Save your money and your time, people."
4,California Dreamin' Yall,"This book focuses on three women, two of whom are working on a career and one who is working on a marriage. It was interesting to read their points of view, although I didn't find the characters to be the most easy to relate to. My favorite character is Marcella, a beautiful woman struggling to be taken seriously as an actor. She is rough on the edges but you can't blame her considering all the crap she deals with from her family and men. Alexis has the best sense of humor in the book and I loved reading her quips.I love this book because it makes you laugh but also makes you think about the stereotypes women in L.A. have to deal with."
4,The snubby,"Good book with lots of anecdotes about the author's time as a CIA paramilitary handgun trainer. The thing about hanguns that a lot of people forget is that if you have to use a handgun for defensive purposes, it will be within 5 feet, and will be over within 3 seconds (on average). Thus, having a gun and getting it into the fight fast is critical, not whether or not you can hit a bullseye at 25 meters, or fire off 17 rounds in a row. Also, the thing most people forget is that during a confrontation, if the bad guy grabs your autopistol, you might not be able to fire it again, because the slide can stick. With a revolver, you don't have to worry about that. If the bad guy gets his hand on your gun, it is much harder to render the gun ineffective."
5,If you are committed to discovering yourself........,"For those truly interested in personal discovery, growth, understanding and a better internal and external life, this is a must read book. The reader will feel the authors passion, pain, joy and commitment to a life full of meaning and value. Shared experiences will connect with all readers at different levels, and quitely encourage deeper exploration into the soul. Whether male, female, an elder or a youth, if you are on a quest for better inner understanding and outer living, you'll benefit from this book. Be prepared to have your inner self stirred and restirred, perhaps leading to personal periods of deep reflection, reevaluation and change if you so allow."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for, Excellent, AAA+++++","Worked perfectly with my new SR12 Sony digital video cam corder. Really love this lens. With a tripod, allowed us to get close up shots of the total solar eclipse in Mongolia on August 1st, and of the Olympics in Beijing a week later."
5,Shopping made easy,"Your website made my search for this book a breeze. It is exactly what I wanted, and the info provided on your site was accurate, as well as sufficient."
2,Zoe mini-backpack,"I bought this mini backpack for my 2 year old. Another reviewer mentioned that it is really small but that it would be perfect for a 2-3 year old, which I agree. My daughter was excited about using her new backpack to carry her breakfast to daycare; however, as soon as I took it out of box it was shipped in and tried to unzip for the first time, the zipper busted off in my hand. The backpack is really adorable so it's unfortunate that it turned out to be defective."
4,Beware - Wrong Titles,"I love Veggie Tales but Amazon has the titles in the description wrong. I received ""Josh and Big Wall"", ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"", ""Rack, Shack and Benny"", ""Esther"", and ""King George and the Ducky"". Unfortunately I own some of these so I have to return it. I hope the collection that I was supposed to get does become available in the future."
5,Great Book,This book confirmed a lot of things I have long suspected about how company's approach change. I have in my life witnessed a number of them fail for not handling distruptive technology correctly.
5,Did you ever wish you could keep a book a secret?,"This book is so good you wish your competitors could be kept from reading it! Christensen does more the think ""out of the box"" he shows you how he developed and substantiated the themes in the book.The disk drive industry is broken down to exemplify an area that has rapid ""disruptive"" technology changes at regular intervals... and how companies adapt and fail...I tell you this book can cost you lost sleep as you contemplate what could shake up your industry and how you will react. This book will be a clasic for 100 years (or more). A must have in anyones collection (no I am not related to the author)."
3,It ends where it should begin,"Clayt Christensen= Mr. Disruptive Innovation. No doubt. He has made his point in management theory; the business as usual approach of established companies is their handicap with disruptive innovations. Although his framework to explain the struggle of established companies and innovation is very useful the book doesn't get into the question; 'how to deal with disruptive innovation' ? i recommend you read 'the innovators dilemma' in combination with books like 'corporate venturing', 'radical innovation' or 'webs of innovation' that go on where christensen ends. however overall this is an absolute must read to understand the struggle of established companies and (disruptive) innovation"
4,The innovators dilemn (how disruptive technologies take a market),"This is supposed to be a business book, and it is, but it's really just a great educational read about how disruptive technologies take over a market. Honda didn't start making luxury cars in 1950, their reputation was a joke, even in Japan. But they started out with quality scooters and moved up the market. Same with intel processors, hydraulic excavators etc.The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business (Collins Business Essentials)"
1,Misleading Title,"This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness. It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought. This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness. However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text. The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed. This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other? You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James ""Varieties of the Religious Experience"" has more insight than the rest of the book. Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James."
2,Be prepapred for some reworking...,"We purchased this for a supposedly ""compatible"" gate, and ended up having to drill some extra holes in the metal where there were none. It would not line up correctly in any position, and still leaves awkwardly sized gaps. Granted, after the extra work, it does the job."
3,doesn't look like the one shown,"The stripes are very faint, the face was sewn crooked. Does NOT look like the picture I seen of it when I ordered it.I've seen better looking wild republic cuddlekins, but not mine."
1,Horrible!!!,This was the worst documentary ever!! it was a waste of time in my life watching that!! It was so dragged on and boring there are way better films about graffiti then this one!!!
5,over the dry side,"Louis is as good as usual. Held my interest from the first page. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who enjoy westerns."
5,"WHO AM I REALLY? TWO HERITAGES, A SAGA OF SURVIVAL!","Imagine waking up one day and finding everything different. Everyone's perception of you has changed. The social and economic conditions around you have changed because of your race. A child born and reared as white discovers he is not. The author shares his experiences honestly- almost too honestly. There is deprivation, and repression contrasted with privilege, opportunity, and comfort. It is an extraordinary account of a man of two worlds, two heritages, mixed-race, who perseveres and triumphs over incredible odds. Taut, dramatic, well written."
4,Life On The Color Line was a novel about Gregory Williams,"Gregory Williams believed that he was white for the first 10 years of his life untill his parents separated. Gregory grew up on both sides of the nation's racial boundaries. Buster Williams alcohlism drove him and family into bankruptcy. Gregory and little brother Mike found out their father James ""Buster"" Williams was a light-skinned African-American man who passed for a Italian American most of his adult life. After his mother and father split up Gregory or Mike didn't see much of their mother Lois Williams. Greg and his brother grew up on the African-American side of the town among their father's relatives. Father Buster encouraged Gregory to study and apsired Mike to hustle like him. While growing up Greg received warnings not to date white girls. Gregory's novel showed how he overcame his struggle to years upon years of povery and racism"
5,"Great book, enjoyable read","The book was delivered in a timely manner from the provider, and I have been reading it in bits and pieces every chance that I get. I would recommend this to anyone...definitely a worthwhile read."
1,This book was much more hype than horror.,"I love horror and read this based on the review in ""The Washington Post Book World"". At first, it appeared to be building to something good, but it went nowhere. No real thought to the plot or characters. This is a waste of time for REAL horror fans."
3,Too mundane for horror genre,"Cora's endless details of her mundane life drag this story down. The interesting scenes are buried in and amongst the chit-chatty monologues about her mother's garden, (...), her cooking, and the weather.I tried my best to get into this book but after 200 hundred pages, the horror bits were just too far and few between. There was too much local gossip. I think the author was trying to write in the style of Lovecraft but she kept getting bogged down in too much detail."
4,Psychological thriller lacks action,"""Incubus"" was an incredibly well-written novel. However, I never identified completely with the characters, and I felt that the book ended just as I was coming to understand the plot. The idea of demons practicing their human forms is unsettling, if not completely original. I think that the book would have benefited from more direct action."
2,Not Clever or Hilarious,"Although there are three blubs on the back cover of this book laudings its""hyperliterate wit"" I found nothing even mildly amusing and I do read a lot of contemporary poetry. I've read at least ten books in the last three months. Compared to Bob Hicock or Dean Young or Joshua Clover or Steve Venright or anyone else I've read recently, but for a few pieces this writing left me cold."
5,Awesome!,"Like way too many women, I have struggled for years to achieve that ever-elusive feeling of 'self-acceptance', and in the process, was diagnosed with an ""atypical eating disorder"" - whatever that means - years ago. Consequently, body image is a topic that always piques my interest and curiosity. This book did 2 things for me: cracked me up (I literally laughed out loud more times than I can count); and precipitated a true shift in my thinking about weight, beauty, priorities, and happiness. For me, body image will always be a struggle, always sitting there somewhere in my brain ready to act out and take me to that 'bad place."" But the insight, empathy, and straight talking with which Ms. Goldman has infused her book, has given me a sense of...hmmmm...the word that comes to mind is relief. 3 words ladies: READ THIS BOOK."
2,The Banged Barbie,"Her accesories are cute, so is the dress, but unfortunately this is one of the uglier Barbie's I've seen. Her hair looks gorgeous from the back when she turns around,...well, you can judge for yourself. For a small child, she's fun and durable. Her outfit looks great on one of my prettier dolls. On a better note, her shoes are adorable. She has the spunky yellow box toe heel."
1,GURNEY SAID THEY ARE SORRY LOOK OUT.,"Ordered from gurneys some things i got and some I did not get. The potatos I got were rotten and smelled so bad ,the postal driver that deliverd them, held them out the window till he got them del. He and i opened the box it smelled so bad he said it may be a dead animal.I called gurneys. and they said sorry. iam getting my c. card people on this. they just don't care.charles"
4,I prefer Tivo to Replay TV,"I bought a Tivo machine....and then returned it within 30 days when I heard about the Replay TV 2020 with a larger hard drive for the same price. I then bought a Replay TV unit and have since returned it in order to buy another Tivo machine. Replay TV was not a bad unit....but I am going back to Tivo as some of the Direct TV stations I received did not show up on the Replay TV guide & therefore could not be recorded. Replay TV also would not allow me to record Direct TV pay per views (Tivo did). Tivo also allows for slow motion playback which is surprisingly convenient. Finally, Tivo also has a better interface for choosing programs to record. Tivo would be perfect if it adopted Replay TV's quick skip feature (though fast forwarding is easy enough), got rid of the useless thumbs up thumbs down feature, and added the extra 6 gigs of hard drive storage to match the 2020 machine (though I never ran out of space)."
4,Beautiful but snug.,"This costume is as beautiful in person as it is online. My only suggestion is make sure to think about the size of your baby ahead of time. I bought the 3 month outfit because my son is 3 months old, but he is a bit bigger for his age. But, I thought 6 months would be too big! So, it would just be easier for customers to have the height and weight limits listed on the page. My son is 25 inches long and 15 pounds and it is snug on him. Hope that helps if you are trying to guess how big you will need your costume to be. Item shipped to me very quickly and I was very pleased with everything else! Great item!"
3,Moderately Enjoyable,"Shames once again puts together a passable-but hardly noteworthy-South Florida thriller in the vein of Carl Hiassen, Elmore Leonard, et al. This time he trots in the tired specter of Russian mafia types running tawdry tourist t-shirt shops as a money laundering operation for the big bucks they make as brokers for ex-Soviet art and weaponry. Against these cardboard villains are arrayed an ex-Wall Street type who left it all to forget about his divorce, take care of his father, and renovate an old hotel; a Jersey transplant called Suki who's stuck in a dead-end job, two creaky old men, and two nice semi-homeless guys. Through it all there's a kind of stumbling, bumbling good naturedness-which serves to heighten the nastiness of the Russians. The outcome is hardly surprising, but it passes the time and is slightly more successful than two other of his books I've read, The Naked Detective and Scavenger Reef,"
5,A treasure from the past that is timeless and a joy .,"While this book is often refered to as a ""hard sci-fi"" book, to me it was a story about people put in a fantastic situation. The old testament biblical subtext was evident even to me as a child. The second book, After Worlds Collide, was better than the first and a good example of a sequel surpassing the original. While there was a satisfying resolution, I have always wanted to know what happened to this brave new world in the making after the story ended. I did not enjoy the 1951 movie, though many people did. Someone, please reprint both of these jewels!"
4,Perrine's story and structure,There was a little water damage but for the price I got it for there is no complaining on my part. The book's content is great and a useful.
4,"""Not Enough Eyes and Teeth Between Them""","The quote above is from James Gandolfini's character, who, (like John Travolta), plays a detective on the tail of two serial killers.The movie is reminiscent of film-noir. Getting off to a slow start, with a seemingly bland story about a con-man, it builds into a character study of two serial killers.Unfortunately, not enough time is spent on characterization of these two, as we flip back and forth between them and Travolta's story. Nonetheless, we get enough of a glimpse into the mind of the killers to make this a tense drama.Salma Hayek was the real star of this one. And though the film has some graphic violence, and suggested violence as well, her performance alone is worth the time you'll spend watching."
4,How did I miss this?,"This is a heck of a good movie. It has a great cast and has lots of really good talented actors. It is also a really compelling and intriguing story based on real events. When I was watching it I thought, ""how the heck did I miss this in the theater... and how did everybody else?"" This is a good movie. I am suprised that it wasn't marketed better and I am suprised that it did so poorly in the theater. I hope that people get a chance to see it on DVD cause it is a good flick."
4,great performance !!!,"I read a few reviews about the movie and it got my attention so when I watched it I was surprised how good the performances were, Travolta and Gandolfini got good chemistry, Jared Leto makes an ok perfomance but is SALMA HAYEK who steal the movie, not only she gives a great perfomance but she's the center of the movie, I was amazed how good of an actress she is, she plays a psyco and malevolant cold-bloded killer !!!The movie might be a little slow but it's a good movie with a killer perfomance by Salma, and I totally agree, she deserves an Oscar nomination for this one !!!"
1,Junk Science? Read this book.,"As a climatologist, i was quite intrested to read this book. After finising it, i was quite dissapointed. The author misrepresents science in every page. HE takes a complicated issue, and confuses the lay-man with his jargon. IT is a pity such intellectually dishonest books are allowed to be written."
1,Debunked,This book is part of the shameless misinformation funded by big oil (Exxon in particular) and debumked years ago by mainstream science.
3,"Loved this one, too!",Bought several cookie cutters for my sister's baby shower. I wanted to give friends and family a more personal gift bag. This cookie cutter was easy to use and decorate. This was definitely fun to decorate.
4,"Three-for-one, can't beat that",Having three separate diameters is nice. Diameter determines the focal length and field of view. So depending on how close you hold the lens to the object determines how much of it will be seen at one time. Having a selection makes it more comfortable to view items depending on how much detail you need to see.
1,Waste of time!,"Maybe I was in a different state of mind when I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. I have never found a book to be so unconvincing and painfully lacking real emotion. The book starts off well enough with Bean adjusting to a new life in Alaska, but it suddenly downward spirals and we're left to believe that Bean has meaningful relationships and a dignifying rebound from a tragedy. Her relationship with Jimmy bothered me more than anything -- apparently he was her best friend, yet at one of the most important parts, the author skims right over him and only provides a brief outline of Bean's emotions. I would have quit halfway through, but since I heard so many positive reviews, I thought the end might be redeeming. Again, I was wrong. The book got worse as I went along and by the end I was thrilled to be freed from reading this dull book."
3,"Pretty, but not very big",I was not impressed with the feeder. It came poorly wrapped and the shipping box was a little damaged. It also isn't very bit. It looks more impressive than it really is.
3,not a movie for the impatient,"Being a huge Angelina Jolie fan, I skipped ""Mystic River"" to check out this new movie. Some of this movie touches you deeply on important life issues and sends tingles up your spine(not scary tingles, but impressive and deep tingles).Its hard to rate a film like this, because its so touching and meaningful, but it fails to make you interested. The storyline isboring and a little unbelievable and it lasted 2.5 hours. As much as I tried to enjoy this movie because I love and deeply respect Angelina, it really never hit the mark of excellence. It had its moments and ended well, but never really came together....acting=4 starsFX=NAending=5 starsatmosphere=4 starsDirecting and Editing=1 starstoryline=2 starsmeaningfullness=5 starsreplay value=0 starsOVERALL=solid 3 stars-ps-to be serious, I couldn't see it twice....(VERY POOR REPLAY VALUE)."
1,Crapfest,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time."
4,A lot better than I expected,"I was expecting the worst when it came to this movie. I am a fan of Angelina Jolie, but it didn't do very well at the box office and I didn't really hear anything about it.Well, none of that matters because this is a very good movie. Angelina does a good job here, as does Clive Owen, her love interest. The story was interesting and eye-opening. It kept my attention even though this isn't a lightning-paced movie. I wanted to know what would happen to Angelina's character. I was also surprised by a few twists that happen unexpectedly. There's a key scene midway through the movie that doesn't mean a lot at the time, but perfectly foreshadows something that happens later on.I highly recommend this movie. It was very entertaining and it really did make you think. I'm not a big fan of movies like this, but this is an exception. It should have been a bigger hit."
2,"Well-Intentioned, But Hardly Convincing","""Beyond Borders"" was originally to be directed by Oliver Stone, and to star Kevin Costner and Cathrine Zeta Jones. Keep that in mind before you watch it. The completed film by Martin Campbell starring Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen retains one of the initial intentions of the film -- namely, love romance. ..Don't say the film opens your eyes. Write down the synopsis of the film, and see the impossible thing that the film requires us to believe. .. ""Beyond Borders"" is laudable in depicting them, yes, ... I sincerely hope that it does not symbolize what happened to the career of Angelina Jolie. (And ""Beyond Borders"" never even reached #10 of box ofice chart in America. What does that mean?)I know the film is a well-intentioned attempt to show the misery of these people, but if you really want to see the authentic accounts of refugees' lives, see Michael Winterbottom's ""In This World."" That is more realistic and shocking, too."
2,"good premise, a great Clive Owen but why the love story?","It's hard to pass up a movie when it's about trying to save starving and dying people in other countries and when the person is played with such a strong presence from Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer and Gosford Park), you know its gonna be a good movie but putting a love story between him and a miscast Angelina Jolie (Shark Tale, Hackers and Taking Lives)...it doesn't add up. Also starring Teri Polo (Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and Domestic Disturbance), Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove and The Forgotten) and Noah Emmerich (Monument Ave., Miracle and Cellular). Yeah, so, good premise sqandered by love story with miscast Jolie but Owen still holds his own in a strong performance."
2,"LikeTrack 5 This is A ""Nightmare""","There are too many quality dance cds on the market. It is no wonder that this cd is ranked around 285,000. I recommend the Pure Disco Series or Disco Nights Series. Those cds will provide more bang for your buck."
5,Great!,"Pros: mounts easy, works well day-to-day, small bars are strong but not obtrusive, quality built, kids can't climb up since bars are vertical.Cons: must be sure it's latched. If you don't here the click, and/or you don't pull up every time to ensure it's latched, it could potentiall be unlatched when it looks latched. This only happened to us once out of hundreds of openings/closings."
1,WARNING!!! Do not buy this gate!,"I purchased this gate to use at the top of my stairs. Shortly after starting to use it, I became aware of a major problem. The gate has to be lifted up slightly in order to lift the bolt on the gate up and into the latching mechanism. The problem is that if you lift up too much on the gate (and it doesn't take a lot), the pins on the gate come right out of the hinges mounted to the wall and you're left holding onto the detached gate. Last week my 18 month old daughter went to close the gate. She lifted up too hard on the gate, lifted it out of the hinges, and my daughter and the gate fell down the stairs!!!! And this is supposed to be a SAFETY gate! I am extremely upset about this. Fortunately, my daughter was not hurt, only very scared. But she could have been hurt badly."
4,IKEA Gate,"Ikea has this same gate for $20.00. Different name and packaging, but same style, hardware, instruction sheets, etc.Babies R Us normally has pretty good pricing, but this one's nuts. Either Kidco or Babies R Us (or both) are gouging on this one.Simple gate, seems safe, and was easy to install. My only suggestion would be hints for installing opening side first; our banister makes it very difficult to install hinge side first."
1,Not good at all,"We bought two gates, to see which worked better on installation, and this was the loser by FAR. The instructions were less clear than the other brand, and the installation guide measurements were off! I had to dig out my drywall anchors and re-drill. The latch is difficult to use, and almost impossible to achieve one-handed. It's unsafe, as when it swings open, the disc-shaped latch it right at toddler eye-height. I would not recommend this gate to anyone. Look for the one that has a push-turn latch instead. It seems much more secure & is a lot easier to use."
1,"STAY AWAY...FAR, FAR AWAY","I bought this TV Jan 2, 2006 - it took 3 weeks to arrive, worked for 4 days, then died. Daewoo sent a technician over, which took another week. He told me it was a bad motherboard, that it would take a week to order (goodbye superbowl party). A week came and went, and he told me Daewoo didn't have the motherboard in stock and wouldn't give him a time frame for delivery of a replacement. Long story short, I had to fight to return it and to this day 2 months later still haven't been able to - I have a 5-foot paperweight in my living room.DAEWOO is HORRIBLE. Stay away from these incompetents."
2,NOT BIG ENOUGH!!!!!!!!,Although this product might work if you had a really small child but with my son it is simply not big enough. It does catch alot of juice and food but so does the floor. It needs to be at least a 3X3 area and this one is just simply not big enough for my son.
3,buy a ... shower curtain,too small - food travels further than 3'x4' - easy clean up but a pain to straighten out on carpet - bunches up - if i knew this was a shower curtain i would've gone to the dollar store and save myself 7 bucks
2,"Great story, shame about the heroine!","OK, I'll be the lone voice of dissent. This book (all O'Connell's books) shows a skilled writer with great descriptive ability and storytelling skills. Then WHY are we treated to a pseudo-mystical cardboard main character? Mallory is a barely functional psychotic, yet we're expected to fall for her gorgeous looks, computer skills (yeah, just try read the part about her controlling the power grid on a per-streetlight and per-room basis, from a homemade laptop, atop a powerpole, without laughing) and her ability to withstand physical pain. Sheesh!O'Connell could do so much better. I won't read another of her books!."
2,Kindle Version,"Love the story. BUT the editing was awful!! One of main characters was named 'Riker', we got ""Piker"" instead. Not so bad, easy to figure out. A question was asked and the answer was ""Nof."" These are just two of 15 to 20 errors. Very distracting from the story and the Kindle product."
2,Religion Stereo Gone Mad,"Read the Amazon reviews and got the impression this author would meet my expectations. I was wrong! Mallory is rarely found in the book until the outrageous/swashbuckling conclusion....her soulmate Charles is a hulking, love sick mess trying to solve the obvious crime(s) while hoping Mallory will finally make a commitment to him....you will not like Charles...a cross between the pigeon you loved to jostle around in the halls in high school and the duty blocking dummy on the jr. varsity football team. As far as character development....Agusta was your duty southern hick wrestling snakes and gators; the holy rollers were bonafide ""Deliverance"" brackish comedy; the sherif was love forelorn for Mallory's mom and seemed trained watching Boss Hog reruns...overall well written but may end up boiler plate script for a very very regional high school play...."
1,Incredible Shrinking Man Vs. Disembodied Brain!,"And the brain loses!Psychotic Colonel Barham is literally out of his head, as his brain is removed from his ailing body to be transplanted into a NASA space probe. While floating in a tank, the brain develops super-powers and starts programming people to kill anyone Barham doesn't like. Anyone who remembers the old chestnut ""Donovan's Brain"" can figure out what happens next, when handsome Grant (""The Incredible Shrinking Man"") Williams starts getting along with Barham's - er, ""widow""?You've seen it before, and seen it better. Second season producer Ben Brady talked OL's poor audience to death in the show's worst scripts - and this is one of the show's worst scripts."
1,Pocahontas VHS,There was nothing wrong with the VHS. I thought I had ordered the DVD. I have returned the VHS via UPS. I took it to UPS on March 23th. Thanks for your help with the speedy return.
1,Disney Yes....Quality No....,"Pocahontas is, in my opinion, quite possibly the worst offering ever from Disney studios *and yes, I am including the forgettable offerings of the '80's in this rating*. Highly stylized animation, a soundtrack with only one worthwhile song *Colors of the Wind* and I would say a bad plot but there really wasn't one there, all contribute to this. Even the voices of David Ogden Stiers *and he had 2 roles!* and Mel Gibson couldn't save this one. Children might like the animal sidekicks, but that is about all that will engage their interest."
2,Different...,This is a good Disney cartoon because it doesn't have a impossible happy ending. But the soundtrack is the worst ever made to any Disney's animated film! It's horrible!
5,Classic!,"One of the best Disney animations and my niece and nephew love it and can't have enough of it! Also, the product was shipped on time and met all my expectations!"
2,Limp. Very limp,"Now don't get me wrong. Check out my Mulan review and you'll see I like some Disney. I adored the Lion King, Aristocats, Aladdin, and the Toy Storys. But not this. The trouble with Pocahontas is that it just isn't that memorable. Pocahontas seems dull, not real at all, and John is just annoying. Meeko and Percy are ok, as is Thomas, but that's about it. The villain isn't either cool or horrible, the only good song is the war song, Disney took painful historical inaccuracies with the plot - and talking about plot, what's with the learning each other's language thing in 5 seconds? And the talking tree (I'm sorry, but she just really annoyed me.) There's no catchy lines - I think the whole movie was basically dull."
2,And the sentient tree will show them the way.,We rank this 34 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own. The most interesting thing about this movie and the smartest character was the sentient willow tree. According to Amazon Sales Rank only 13 of the 41 movies rank higher than Pocahontas and 28 lower. Our family clearly liked this movie less than most. We felt it was a below average effort by Disney except for the artwork and inking.
2,Another substandard Disney effort,"I was so disappointed in this film. The animation is lovely, as always, but the ending was disappointing and the music was definitely mediocre. If you're gonna make an entirely fictitious film about a real life historical character, would it hurt to have a happy ending? Instead, John Smith goes back to England alone. What a bummer. Rent, don't buy, this movie."
2,Mediocre and potential to teach racist language,"The songs and story line were a dud, not very interesting. Or perhaps it was just the racist language on both sides that distracted me. ""Savage"" ""White man"" ""injun"" ""demon."" My daughter is only four and so didn't seem to pick up on it, but an elementary-schooler might pick up on some of the language. And it didn't help that Mel Gibson, who can't sing, is the male lead and is known to have some racist views in real life. Finally, Disney was unable to keep any deaths off camera and implied and so it was the first Disney movie which she asked what happened to this or that character (who was killed).Pass on this one."
1,Looks like a recording off of video,This DVD looks like it has been recorded off of video. The images are not crisp and motion has interesting color changes.
2,Incredibly Sexist and Somewhat Racist,"I would not suggest allowing children to watch this film unless you are completely comfortable with perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes. Annoyed by depictions of female being ""saved"" by male counterparts, and glowing depictions of ""life being perfect"" for Natives prior to arrival of whites is a bit of a stretch. This film perpetuates several misconceptions about Native Americans, which are incredibly unnecessary."
3,DVD is bad quality,You can read other's opinion on the actual movie. I just want to comment on how terrible the DVD resolution is. It looks as if we're watching a well worn video. Horrible pixalation. No where up to the transfers of A Bugs Life or Tarzan.Ugh.
4,hard to get movies made easy,The big box store had already discontinued this title and I wanted it to go with a Pocahontas doll for my granddaughter. It came quickly and in good shape. Haven't watched it yet but I'm sure it will be in great condition when we get around to it!
1,I can operate a Xerox machine better than this,"This is a poor, sloppily bound mess. Seems to be a Xerox copy of only the second volume (not even the fourth as is indicated) of the sixth edition of an 1809 four volume collection. Some of the pages are not even copied straight. Compiled with no notes, no glossary, no thought or imagination. Only contains some of Burns' letters containing some of his poetry. Worthless without context. Would be an insult to my shelves and certainly to the Bard. I should have been tipped off by the sophomoric product description. Back it goes."
2,This cd is terrible compared 2 other master p cds,"i wish they didnt make into a double cd, cuz if i got 2 choose which 1 i would take, i would definately take disc 1, becuase sum of the songs have a hint of good west coast rap in it, like let my 9 get em'. The whole cd has probably like 6 good songs on it, E-40 duz a track on which made the song sound tight. But u should get Ghettos are tryin 2 kill me or True"
1,UGHHH!!!!!! THIS SH*IT IS WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Either you love P or you hate him! The only thing I give props to P about, is that he has one hell of a marketing scheme, and he has the ability to sell tacky a$$ records world wide. You can tell that the whole No Limit camp, don't think about sh*t when they make their albums. Everything that comes out of No Limit is wack. From the lyrics to the album covers. Funny thing about it is that P knows his sh*t is going to sell, so why should he bother trying to put together a solid album. He scribble down every choppy rhyme that comes to his head. Lay it down, then watch the money role in. How the hell does he do it?"
1,ARE YOU CLOWNING ME?,"THIS CD SUCKS,IT SHOULDN'T EVEN RECIEVE A STAR. THIS IS THE MOST TRASHEST MUSIC I EVER HEARD. AND WHO EVER SAID ""BUY THIS CD AT YOUR OWN RISK,HOLLA AT U"""
2,Not so Hot!!,"I think that master P and his whole crew needs to change there beats or something because their music just dosen't flow right. Everthing from their rhymes to their beats are tired and over used. I understand thats their style, but it's something that I can't understand. I respect him for giong out in the world and doing something many upcomming rappers/singers only dream of doing, but this CD just isn't as hot as people make it out to be."
2,okay/alright,"What can I say about this one? This is probably the weakest no-limit project period! It's one helluva task to listen to this album all the way through. Master P never was a great lyricist, and this tedious double album lives up to it. The flowing is inconsistent, the production is so wack and commericial it'll drive you crazy. Only a hard-core no-limit fan will like this, but a hardcore rap-fan will have their dislikes about this one!Peace El-715"
5,i DoNt BeLiEvE sUm oF tHeSe ReTaRdS,this is tha bomb. maybe my best cd but definitly top 3. buy it. those retards givin it 1's r just mad cuz hes rich and they's poor. master p is tha greatest rapper ever so buy his last cd
4,"Half of the material is dope, but recycled beats is blatant.","This is the follow up release of the multi-platinum ""Ghetto D"", which skyrockted and topped Billboard. I have anticipated for this double-album for quite a long time. I'm a huge No Limit fan and this was quite a dissapointment. "" Til We Dead and Gone"" wasn't even half as good comparatively as title track ""I Got The Hookup"" of the soundtrack. Master P tried to exploit the success of ""I miss my homies"" on ""Goodbye To My Homies"", a blatently recycled track from Boys 2 Men's ""Hard To Say Goodbye."" Overall this album contains too many recyled beats from ""Ghetto D"" and is not really woth buying, but well worth checking out."
1,This album is a bad omen.,"People must not buy this album. The beats are boring. The lyrics are non-original and it's soo tired. Master P I'm so glad that this is ""DA LAST"" album...I hope you never contaminate a mic again."
1,Da Last Album.. Pleeeeease?,"Am I the only one that realizes that MasterP has no rapping skills whatsoever? He's a marketing genius, much props for that. How he debuts #1 every album on the No Limit label is beyond me. Lyrics are bland and overused, production is basic beats, nothing good to say about this album whatsoever."
4,Beautiful watch,"I wanted to buy an inexpensive watch but couldn't stand any plastic or cheap material. This watch is ideal for that purpose. It is pretty and all metal. However I find the hands do not stand out very clearly from the wathc face because of their colors. It would be nice if they use lighter color for the two watch hands. But it's not such a big deal. After a few weeks, I'm getting used to the new look of my watch now!"
4,"If you have skipped over one of our major ""Founding Fathers""","John Adams, you may want to consider Joseph Ellis's fine work, ""Passionate Sage"". Mr. Ellis does not dwell on Adams childhood or early years & that is fine. Not really that extraordinary for his time. Adams biggest problem was & is that he has never had the armies of p.r. men that have promoted Washington, Franklin & Jefferson thru the years. Adams knew this yet respected & envied them. He also knew his intellectual gifts surpassed the big three of the revolutionary generation. His integrity & forthrightness made him a most disagreeable person. He rationalized his unpopularity, feeling that virtue with fame is no virtue at all. His unpleasantness mellowed in his later years but not his brillant mind. In their last 14 years he pursued a lively correspondence with Thomas Jefferson. This may be his best legacy."
3,"Love Sony, just not this one.","I absolutely love the screen, keyboard layout, and media controls. It's all streamlined, to make me a very happy minamilist. However, in the one year I've had it, the SD slot, the CD drive, and one of the USB ports are damaged (yes, I have kids). I expected something more durable from a $2K computer! It's not long before I will be looking for another laptop, probably not another Vaio."
1,Do Not Buy,My Vaio is ONE year old. I spend AT LEAST 10 hours a week trying to keeping this POS with a pulse. The wireless card has gone out which means I have to have a USB connection. Thx guys...ur the best. I can not tell u how disappointed I am with Sony. I have other Sony products but b/c of this I will definitely reconsider. BTW Sony you can also give MS a high five for letting me down (you allowed them to respresent your product).
2,"Looks decent, but that's all",Cheap filling that bunches up after a few months. Sewn together poorly with some kind of plastic thread that irritates bare skin. Not worth the price even though the price is decent compared to the ridiculous cost of some couch pillows.
2,Pork skins,"The pork rinds did not have any seasoning on them, so, they tasted very bland. I have tasted much better from the pork rinds sold in my area stores. I would not purchase this item again. Very dissapointed."
4,The Only Victor,"Personally, I like the Bolitho novels which show him as a human being wrestling with affairs of the heart. And I liked 'The Only Victor' for that attribute of it, and I have recommended it to people for that reason. Obviously some readers only want him rampaging across the sea in a man of war, young and immature, not as a grown man fleshed out in all ways. Well, I can understand that 'The Only Victor' would disappoint them."
5,Excellent Book,"I love, love, love this manual. Very complete and wonderful how to for reflexology. I recommend this book to anyone just starting out with relflexology. I purchased this book for my massage staff who recently took a certification class on reflexology."
5,profoundly useful for helping me to create a happy life,"Every part was helpful. The explanations gave me the background to understand the new ideas. The dialogue sections were easy and fun to read, and made each section crystal clear. The part I liked best, however, was the lists of ""unhappy"" beliefs that many people hold. I found many of my own beliefs on those lists and chose to change them. This one is my favorite of Kaufman's books."
2,A good product but....,"The package came a few days later than promised but still quite fast. However the packing left much to be desired. The bag and the beam rack were just stuffed into the box with no extra stuffing to keep the items from rolling about during shipment. This was not the usual Amazon packaging that I was used to. True enough when I installed the rack I noticed that the bar on the beam rack that secures the bag was cracked. Very disappointed with Amazon for this. Surelly thay can do better; they have before! As for the product itself , the EX looks too fragile with rack being made of plastic , I should have gone for the E type which looks like the bar is made of Aluminium instead."
5,Super Cute,"Minor Details is about 4 girls who go to a private school and discover a mystery on their hands! The girls go through their list of enemies and ""friends"" to see who done it! Its a cross between Nancy Drew and Mean Girls. This is a great movie for girls whose parents do not want to worry about fowl language throughout the movie or a movie with bad values. You can rent this movie through select RedBox locations as well as on Netflix. If you looking for another good clean suggestion try ""Your So Cupid!"" directed and with some of the same actors.The movie also features a great song at the end called Secret Identity by Brittnee Belt. Go check it out!"
2,Not as effective as other brands,I bought this because all of the positive review. I thought I'd try it just in case it was better than Sulfodene. but it is NOT. Sulfodene works but it is just expensive. I'll have to try another product as well as go back to Sulfodene.
4,Vet's Best Hot Spot Spray,"This spray gives our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel some relief from itching. She has allergies. We bathe her in Phytovet CK Antiseptic Shampoo every several weeks, but spray her with Vet's Best Hot Spot Spray twice a day. We all get to sleep through the night."
4,Spicy vegetarian dishes,"I gave this book four stars because I expected more traditional recipes. I think the majority of recipes is Ms. Prasad's creation. If you are in search of traditional Indian vegetarian cookery, find ""Lord Krishna's Cuisine"" by Yamuna Devi or ""Dakshin"" by Chandra Padmanabhan. The latter does wonders with vegetables, believe me.That said, everything I cooked so far (spicy potato soup, mulligatawny, navrathna korma, potato and black-eyed pea curry, spinach and lentils, parathas, cilantro chapatis, etc.) has been pretty simple and tasty. I recommend it to anyone who likes vegetables and spice. I liked the variations to stuff parathas, utappams, etc."
3,Competent but flawed imitation,"Fans of Mice Parade and Tortoise will undoubtedly find much to like with the similar sounding, Xylophone-crazed percussion hounds Dylan Group, but a few elements hold the group back from achieving great album's like those bands. Most of these compositions emulate that sound rather well, but a few tracks veer off-course in underwhelming experimentation or repetitious droning. The concluding segment of the last track in particular, will all but eradicate any joy found throughout much of this disc."
5,A cheap way to Chip your pet,"I like ""Home Again"" chip makers and their services. I have 2 other pets that were chipped with ""Home Again"" micro-chip, so it was no brainier to get our new 4-legged family member get the same chip. Buying it from Amazon is about 1/2 the price than getting the same chip anywhere else. My vet injected the micro-chip for free during regular visit. You can also do the ""chipping"" procedure yourself if you have experience with sub-cutaneous injections."
1,Kindle Edition lacks the translations,"I purchased the Kindle edition of this book. Or so I thought. I have all of Legge's introductory material, but not the actual translations - which is what I thought I was paying for. It is the hamburger without the beef, Hamlet without the Prince, it is not a different way of buying the same book, but a way of buying a much shorter and less useful book."
4,Anakin Skywalker Costume,"The costume was great. Could be a little better made for the price, but overall very happy with it. The rubber belt was way too big for my 6 year old though."
2,Too small,"My very small child can't even get his head through the hole. His head would have to be the size of an infant to make it through. I will have to return this product.Star Wars Child's Deluxe Anakin Skywalker Costume, Small"
3,too expensive,"My kids really love Star Wars but honestly all the star wars costumes are overpriced. I can get a Tom Arma collectable Halloween costume for this price. The belt is WAY TO BIG.....but being a good mom I let the kids choose their costumes. The Anakin Costume is nice if you are thinking of buying it but I just wished it was cheaper. Also, for the price can they throw in a light saber or a cloak. Alas, I can't sew so this costume will work. Oh and my son told me the material makes him itch. So I have mixed reviews on this costume. It is so so...not a total waste of money."
3,For couples ready to move forward,"This book deals strictly with couples who are both ready to commit to change once the cheating spouse has stopped seeing the other. Although it helped provide some insight into the matter, I found it really did not help if both weren't ready to move forward."
5,Read it cover to cover and it all will come together,"From the 18-page Personal History Questionnaire to the sample good-bye letter, Dr. Harley again demonstrates his expertise in the area of helping couples. This is a step-by-step guide about how to recover as a couple and by yourself. I'm happy to say that my wife and I are in love again...and not by chance."
1,unhappy mama,"This was a gift, so I now have no box. I was excited as I thought the automatic sensor would give my baby viewing pleasure. The sensor dosent even work, not even with me yelling at it. I cant believe FP. Dosent recall this product. It's horrible if you are looking for this benefit. The light show is pretty cool, but it only stays on for ten minutes."
2,NICE light show BAD reception,"Nice light show but awful reception!! Can't hear baby crying full lungs unless I'm standing right next to the monitor, which doesn't help if you have a noisy house already! Definitely would NOT buy again, and we are having to contact Fisher Price now hoping to get a replacement monitor sent... since we already threw away packaging. Yuck."
1,Baby monitor does not work but light show ok,"I've read a few of these reviews and think that Fisher Price must have a quality control issue. Our monitor does NOT work under any circumstances, even after reading the manual and having all the handy people in our family try to make it work. A friend of ours gave us a Sony that works AWESOME! So I don't think it's user error. We should send the unit back but I can't be bothered -- our solution is just not to buy anything with the Fisher Price logo in the future. To those of you who bought one of these that works, congratulations, one must have escaped working from the factory :)"
2,Worthless,"This monitor is a great idea, but not worth the money. I can't get my light show to work at all. My husband spent half an hour trying to fix it, but you shouldn't have to fix something that is brand new. UPDATE- He fixed it. The light bulb inside the main unit needed adjusted so it could fully touch the metal part. I still have to check out the clarity."
2,Piles of useless information....,"If I could own just one survival book, this certainly wouldn't be the one. I hear that it makes pretty good tinder though...."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for.,Almost too (hard to explain) Philosophical.. was looking for something with more detail and specific as opposed to a broad mention of possibilities. But there are many good ideas and points in any case.
3,progresses the discussion,This text certainly helps those that want to further develop their understanding of sustainability from a number of perspectives. It also provides useful information on different approaches being taken to measuring and reporting on sustainability.
2,Omega constellation Watch,"I am very dissapointed with the product. Maybe it sat on the shelf to long. Its a Quartz watch once it has a battery it should work, This item fail after less than a months wear on the wrist of a woman who was so proud to have the item until she gave away her other watch to a friend because it didn't have a diamond bezel. We have sent it in for repair but we don't expect it to be good even if return because a jeweler said that there should be nothing to repair in a Quartz watch. It was pretty, it looked good, but boy what a dissapoinment!"
3,"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, WELL SUNG.","I'M GLAD I GOT THIS RECORD OF AN OPERA I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY HEARD. GAVAZZENI CONDUCTS A CRISP, TAUT PERFORMANCE. I DO NOT HAPPEN TO BE A FAN OF DEVIA'S HIGH, REEDY, WHITE VOICE (NO WONDER THIS OPERA WAS ONLY STAGED ONCE AT THE MET FOR A VERY SIMILAR TYPE OF VOICE, LILY PONS), BUT SHE PERFORMS WELL. I WAS QUITE TAKEN WITH PETTERI SALOMAA'S EXQUISITE, LAMBENT BARITONE AND THE PIEROTTO OF SONIA GANASSI, SINGERS I HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED. LOVELY MUSIC, IT DOES MERIT A REVIVAL IN THIS COUNTRY."
3,"Boring ""Party""","Jazz guitarist Barney Kessel's albums for Contemporary are a bit of a mixed bag. Some of them, like hisPoll Winnersseries are winners, while others likeWorkin Outdon't really work out (see my reviews of both). This session from July 19, 1960 unfortunately falls in the latter category, primarily because he's working out with the same players as on the aforementioned poor session. The one plus here is an early look/listen at bassist Gary Peacock, a jazzman who would arguably go on to eclipse even Kessel in stature in the field. If you are interested in this guitairst, check out the discs with Ray Brown and Shelly Manne -- the winners are that party!"
5,The Only Way to Eat for the Rest of your Life,'Fat is not your Fate' is an excellent book dealing with the many obstacles associated with weight loss. It helps you recognize your own body through tests that categorize your body type and then teaches your how to eat accordingly for the rest of your life. This is the only book you will ever need to read for eating correctly and maintainly a lean and healthy body. These authors are PhD. professionals in their field who have spent years studying and doing researach in preparation for this book.
4,Advertising made easy,The advice given in this book is timeless. Hopkins was truly ahead of his time. Do no let the 101 page length fool you. This book is packed with valuable knowledge. Highly recommended for anyone with their own business or anyone in the advertising/marketing game.
4,Previous reviewer had skewed expectations,"This CD is obviously billed as a biography. One look at, I don't know, anywhere on the jacket would clue you in. The first reviewer was looking for a comedy album and didn't find it and so of course he was disappointed. However, as a biography goes this was concise and well thought out with many excerpts from interviews with friends and family, and excerpts from Bruce's performances as well. The narration can be bit muggy at parts and they don't always identify who is talking, but overall it is a speedy and easy way to get to know the life of Lenny Bruce with some comedy mixed in as well."
2,I'm trapped in an adventure novel and I can't get out!,"I'm actually a fan of Louis L'Amour and his westerns, so I was pretty excited about the idea of him writing a medieval adventure novel. However, I was very disappointed with ""The Walking Drum"". The book is basically a series of repetitive adventures involving Kerbouchard (another of L'Amour's supermen)getting into trouble and getting back out again. Repeat, ad finitum. The only thing that seems to change is the backdrop. That L'Amour knew the places and histories he was writing about firsthand is obvious. He was always good at making the settings of his books very vivid and living parts of his books. But the actual structure of the novel's plot -- well, here it's just a hodgepodge. By the time Kerbouchard rescued his father I just wanted to get the darn book finished already. Definitely not one of his best."
2,a book set in a great time peroid....,"...but not a good story. I don't want to sound like at 11-and-a-half year old person that wrote a review to Emma or whatever, but the peroid this book was set in, is a great time. It had all of the makings of a good book, but it was just too slow for my liking. If you like high paced books set in the Middle Ages, this book has some moments like that, but not enough."
5,"Wonderful, engaging story","One of Lamour's best. Very engaging, action packed, set in great historical perspective, shows extensive researsh on part of author. Fast moving and action packed. Good book!"
3,"Exceptional history, predictable characters","While I enjoyed the setting and characters of the book, not to mention the historical aspects, it was just too predictable. Kerbouchard was a likeable character most of the time, except when it came to the women in the story. Each ""love"" interest he meets becomes a damsel in distress that owes him much favor. He becomes separated from them, and forgets them long enough to venture on to the next adventure. Towards the end of the book, he boldly professes that he loved them all. The most absurd rendezvous was that of Sundari. They met, and within the following hours, fell deeply in love with one another. The book was a really good read with the exception of the romantic aspect. I would advise reading it, but don't get too wrapped up in Kerbouchard's current love interest, because she won't be around very long."
5,Beautiful Memorial,I know Lindsay from our work in the consulting field and met his wife briefly. Lindsay did everything possible for his wife during her illness to make her last days meaningful and comfortable. Reading this book reminded me of how much he loved her and how much she is missed. The stories are heartrending. It is a beautiful memorial that Lindsay created for his wife. Everyone who has lost a special person should read this book.
5,1st review,Came in good time and enjoyed the slim case. I originally had it on DVD but its way better in Blu-Ray
3,Finally all three..,Not too bad. Complete version of the 1st movie with commentary and other bonus. No extras/bonus on 2nd and 3rd.
3,Excellent bulb but expensive,The halogen bulb is good quality like you expect from GE but the price is expensive for an 18 watt light. I bought it to replace one that was used on landscaping and it works well. Only three stars due to price.
2,Thinking about buying this book? Don't.,"This book has good illustrations and diagrams, but is out of date. With only a brief section on digital photography this book looks older thatn its published date of 2003."
5,luv my tinkerbell,The mat was so beauiful when I put them in my truck it make it look classy they are so nice I highly recommend these item you won't go wrong and the price was great I recieved them fast you can just wipe them off with wet cloth when they get dirty I get alot Components from friends and family great item.
1,Did not work for use made itching worse,"I bought this thinking it would help out the multiple hotspots that developed my my pup's feet after she had a really bad seasonal allergy attack, well it turns out it made thing A LOT worse. She actually started to lick and chew even more and instead of helping with the itch it made her more itchy, which i then realize she probably is allergic to the spray as well! so this is a no go for me. I would like to see the wording on the label changed to to encompass all types of skin itchyness...."
3,"It helped, but my vet didn't like it","My dog was suffering from a hot spot, which was progressively getting worse. While I think the spray helped take some of the itch away, it only covered my dog's symptoms. When I took it into my vet, he said that it wouldn't actually help improve her problems, so he prescribed wipes instead."
2,Smells bad and didn't work for my cat,I got this for my cat because she has skin allergies and had one specific area where she was picking. I could not get this to work for her because it smelled so bad and she licked it right off. It might work for dogs but I wouldn't recommend a spray like this for cats.
3,"Some good news, some bad news . . .","Ok, so it is a great book. It is the world that i have in my heart from D&D. But way much information is gone. Vampires, ancient dead, lycantrophy... it's all there. But where in the hell is Strahd ? Azalin ? Lord Soth ?!?!?!?They're gone... for the mists i bet ;)pAnyway, Vistani looks good, and the races and classes are ok too.I miss some especific prestige classes, and many ohters things. It seems to me that they want to publish a lot of other books covering especifics domains and villains.But even then it has some lot of information to begin with. Just don't dream too high before you get it !"
4,Nice uniform pants,These pants fit really well in the waist and length. They are a bit long but my daughter is tall for her age so they are perfect for her. They are very well made and seem like they will last the whole year.
4,Great,"These are great pants. My 8 year old is very picky and she, for the most part, has worn these with no problems."
1,"Been there, Done that!","Most of the things in this book have been published in other books. I wish Bruce Lee was still alive so I wouldn't have to buy a book that is stale with Bruce's 1960's, hippie philosophy. I believe that Bruce would be spinning in his grave if he knew we were rehashing all his old material. I think the editors and Linda Lee should stop abusing the memory of Bruce Lee to make a quick buck. I will take my book back for a refund."
3,milkman's review is 100% inaccurate,Star Wars Galaxies does NOT cost $10-11 a month. It costs $14.95 a month. $14.95 * 2 = $29.90.milkman clearly does not know what he is talking about whatsoever.
5,2001: A Space Odyssey meets The Perfect Storm,"Another great book by my favourite author! This one brought back memories of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey (any connection to the year 2001 and the theme?) combined with The Perfect Storm's menacing ocean. Add a little ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" type race activity amongst the sailers, and Mr. Thayer's awesome sense of humour (the methodolgies used to get the foreign sailers to come into the race, for example), I could barely put this book down- and read it in three sittings!"
2,Bronze should be all-caps in the name of this shoe,"I'll start out with the statement that this is a good shoe. It fits well and the build quality is fine. It's comfortable and the shape is great.The major problem I have with the shoe is that there is quite a bit of a very, uh, bright bronze on the toe and side ""stripe"" and lace area of the shoe. The pictures at Amazon.com do not come close to representing it correctly. My sister had ballet slippers that looked just like these areas. It's as bright as a new penny. More copper than bronze. I took a dremel tool with a buffing wheel and got this paint off. I wouldn't recommend anybody else try it. It took a long time (I did it while watching a game on TV), but it at least makes the shoe wearable.Be very aware that the toe, side stripe, and laces area are all a very bright copper."
4,How it used to be!,This is a great book for anyone who was not alive in the 50's. It gives you some background on race relations back then. Didn't care for the curse words. But the story was excellent.
1,Bone-headed delusion,I was unfortunate to receive this absurd book as a white elephant gift. Only a fool would believe this drivel. The positive reviews above were probably written by the author himself.I once saw a squash that looked like a duck-billed platypus. I think that is a sign from God that the second coming is near.
3,"One came with the lens, so I needn't have ordered it extra","I ordered a Conon EF 16-35mm f/2.8 EF lens. (LOVE IT)Amazon ""suggestions"" that others had also ordered a Adoroma soft case and a Jancos Lens Hood - so I ordered both of those too. Then when the lense came a Canon lens hood and the same Adoroma soft case were already included. So I returned the extras I had ordered for a refund minus a restocking charge.Love the Lens - had not seen that the hood and case were a part of what was shipping with it.The soft case is fine otherwise though I havn't had much use for it yet."
3,The Movie has more impact................,"An interesting but dated account of poor Mildred's climb to the top. The move has more impact and more drama but the book is interesting in that Mildred uses sex to advance her career. The Vida of movie fame is a way more interesting character. Not a bad read but if you're expecting the same story as the famous Joan Crawford movie, you're in for a disappointment."
5,Character Complexity At Its Finest,"Mildred Pierce is a novel ahead of its time. James Cain is a talented writer and creates a set of complex characters, none of whom the reader sympathizes with for the entirety of the novel. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future."
2,Not as good as competition.,"If you only need moderately sharp blades, these should be good enough. That said, if you don't need really, really sharp blades, you probably aren't changing blades that often, therefore buying them in packs of 100 really isn't worth it.If you, like me, are obsessive about always having a perfectly sharp blade to get perfect cuts in paper or thin plastic, you should spend a few extra dollars and buy the excel bladesNo. 11 Blades Bulk, which in my experience, are much sharper."
4,good for its price range,this digital camera is comparable to 200 dollar cameras that are being sold as of now.. i have used many different brand names in the 100 to 200 dollars price range and the result comes out the same when it comes down to picture quality. The only problem I see with this camera is that it does not have the fast movement feature. Its hard to capture a child playing around.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this camera Sunday, and return it Tuesday. If you get lucky, you get 1 good picture out of 10. You get good picture, if you are 4-5 yard away from the object, and zoom in. Is the object in front of you, like flowers, what ever you try, the picture aren't clear. Night shots take 5 or more seconds, in this time you have to hold the camera still. Picture from my cat, with night shot, the eyes looks pretty scary.My 6 years old camera ""Agfa ePhoto"", takes better pictures, as the Samsung Digimax S500."
5,Great little digi camera!,"This is my 2nd digital camera and I just got it on Saturday, today is Monday, and I love it! My 1st digi didn't have all of these cool things you can do to your pics like this one does... so I'm real impressed and for the money you spend, which is little, its well worth it! Plus the movie mode with voice recording action is way cool... having lots of fun with this camera! I'd even give as a gift. A+!"
5,Great book,"Love the book, i'm not a very big vampire fan but steakley brings a great story. The heroes are tormented and afraid but still fight on. they got the backing of the catholic church and god but they'll need more than that to survey great book. buy it and read it you'll not be disapointed."
1,Retarded,"I loved Steakley's book ""Armour"", which I read when young, and still think about. It was superb. Based on the strength of that book I bought this book the second it appeared in the book store.I was sorely disappointed. This book is simplistic, one-dimensional, and lame. I about flipped when I saw them make it into a movie; oh well, I guess all things Vampire are hot now. In conclusion; forget about this book, buy ""Armour"", you'll be happier in the end."
2,"Florid, Lurid and other -ids","This is not a boring book, oh no, but it has some major faults. Here's one, which pretty much killed the last part of the book for me, and hence, no real payoff: **SPOILER WARNING** the reveal of the bigbad vamp, the one we've heard but not quite seen, the one pushing all the buttons, the one that ~ heck, it would have been more satisfying if Steakley had just said, ""Aw, it's Dracula"" ~ ?? Yeah that one. Turns out he's actually NO ONE WE'VE EVEN HEARD OF UP TO THAT POINT IN THE BOOK. So when Felix says, ""The bastard's name is..."" you will respond with, ""I'm sorry, WHO?"".No punch. A lynch-pin disclosure in the book and it lacks any dramatic impact. Steakley tries to tell us all about him then, in the few paragraphs before he gets wasted by Team Crow anyway, but you won't care.Why didn't he make it one of the George Bushes? J.R. Ewing? That would have been more interesting."
4,Vampire$ makes the money!,Now this is what I call a book! Non-stop action is the appeal of the novel Vampire$ and that is what you get. The blood flies in this tale of Vampire$ Inc. and the hunters that run it. Jack Crow is the lead vampire hunter in a story about the tightly wound group he leads. You just can't take your eyes away from the inticing (how the heck do you spell that!) writing by John Steakley. The ending will amaze anyone. One of the best buys I have ever had!
2,Stick with the movie,"After reading the glowing reviews of the book, I ran right out and got it. Well, it is nothing like the movie, and thank God that John Carpenter got a hold of this and made it into something entertaining. The book gets boring quick, unless you like long passages about how 'lovely' a girl is, and unfinished sentences about monsters. The book actually had less atmoshpere than the movie, if that's possible. And the movie definitely has a better storyline and ending. Rent John Carpenter's Vampires again, for all of the above, and the acting, scenery, and music.The movie is wonderful."
1,Sucked,"This book sucks; It's so bad I only read up to chapter 9 (not enough even half way through it). Too many characters think that they are so clever that frankly they are just annoying. The plot could be interesting; but, the author does not know how to deliver it. I recommend this book for the trash can only."
4,"Loved the book and plot, but hated the ending","Alright...i've read this book five times now <and counting>. I love the plot. Jack Crow is a grand hero and taking him in with the rest of the team there could have been a winning series here. (especially the hint of werewolves hehe) The movie with James Woods is good, also, but it is NOT the book. The basic concept is there but that is it (and thats sketchy) I personally feel (along with one of my best friends) that the ending cheated us out of a toatlly wonderful book. I do love it but...but but but...the ENDING could have been handled so much better. The author seems to have gotten bored with his own story and twisted it so it would end."
5,Spot on with twist and turn faster than lightning,"This book was great, I read it after watching the film which was good as the film had no bearing on the book, if you like the book watch the film but do not envisage it as the same, there are characters in this book who stand out like Felix and they left him out of the film. all in all a top class book"
5,I loved this book it was spooky but wonderful!!!!!!!,"John Steakly may very well be the most interesting author that ever lived to think of such a compelling horror story and be able to put it into words makes that author very good. I saw the movie and loved it also, I have not read any other John Steakly books but definetly plan on it in the future. John thought of this book very well, and where did he come up with some of those names, there sweet, but weird. So i highly recomend this book to you if you like books with vampires it may very well be the best vampire book ever made. read it under your own risk though, it's scary!"
4,Good book,Vampire$ was a good book which I thought was well written. The main reason I decided to leave a review was to comment on an earlier review. The reviewer stated that he/she had stopped reading the book after 30 pages because of the foul language. I believe the langauge was meant to fill out the main character and show what kind of man he was (doing the job he did). It bothers me to see someone stop reading because of such a small point as language then comment (giving a bad rating 1#) on the book without having read the whole thing.
4,Don't see the movie!! Read the book!!,"I read this book about 5 or 6 years ago and have been waiting for a sequel ever since! The first two chapters left me laughing like a lunatic on crack and completely entranced. Read the whole thing in one sitting. The description of the deputy in the jail nearly made me wet myself.On the more serious side, this work flew along and was action packed until you got into the scenes retelling the tale of the female protagonist. I found it rather blah for about 15 pages, then it picked right back up in the same hell-bent-for-leather style that made it so much fun to read.I recently saw the movie and brother....did that massacre a good book. I almost walked out half way through! I was ashamed the plot of the book was not upheld and that I had subjected my friends to such an awful defamation of a wonderful book.I recommend the book heartily!"
5,I hunt Vampires for a living......,"I picked up this book because of the qoute at the start. This book was amazing from start to end I could not put it down. If you are looking for something different in a vampire novel this is it. Steakley's characters are powerful and moving, and the vampires themseleves are down right cruel. If you buy any vampire novel this is the one to buy.This novel tells the story from the hunters view. If you were faced with a real Vampire who would you call... Vampire$!"
2,Vampires,I was very disappointed with the expletives used LIBERALLY throughout the book. I did not finish it.
2,"Strong starter, weak from page 50 on","Bleuach!!! The horror in this book was for horrible. A strong beginning but it then spiraled into weak adolescent fantasy. The characters were cardboard, the vampires were Romero revisited ala ""Night of the Living dead"". The one small concept addressed in the book which is interesting dealt with Vampire sex or lack thereof."
3,Good Fun,"Great Idea! Vampires exist; they are evil incarnate; the Vatican knows about them and hires mercenaries to deal with them. The book is best when it is dealing with the mercenary team doing its work. Facinating! It loses steam when it branches out to the Felix story and to the love interest. Also, I did not care for the dispatch of the key vampires. Steakley spends the entire book building our interest in the two main ones. One goes out very ordinarily, one goes out in a paragraph and a third that we did not know about takes out Crowe. But I pick. This book was fun! I can hardly wait for the movie."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I have to agree with the reviewers who believe that this DVD is uninspiring and not well done. The presenters ARE amateurish and reading from an awkward script.Counting would be good to prevent back misalignment. Except for the warm-up and cool-down, where the stretches aren't held nearly long enough, the entire workout consists of a hands-and-knees position, where the arms and shoulders get more of a workout than the back and leg muscles, and a lying-down series of pelvic tilts and mild crunches. Not bad exercises, but not enough variety, not enough repetitions, and, most importantly, no thorough explanation of how to optimally tighten the abdominal muscles."
3,Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolour,Unfortunately this book did not quite live up to my expectation. Perhaps the title was a little misleading. Would be helpful tool though for a beginner in this media.
5,Junior's Best Work Yet,"As an avid fan of Junior's work, i give this compilation the best review from his past two. Junior took the best songs from Arena and Twilo and brought them together to make one of the greatest album out there. I agree that listening to these CD's is like being at Twilo and Arena. If you haven't had the chance to hear Junior live, then crawl out under from your rock and get to NY. Go to Twilo but make sure you have enough E-nergy to last till the early morning hours. Keep clubbing hard."
4,Easy to read and understand,"As a person who is not ""in to"" astrology, I found this book interesting and easy to read. It gives good insight into your own personality and those with whom you relate - whether in love, friendship or strictly professionally."
5,Simply a masterpiece,"This CD touched me in many ways, on many levels. Just the variety and quality of the music on this album is enough to make anyone want to buy it and listen to it again and again, time after time. The artist is so gifted and has such an ear for beautiful melodic tones. The songs on this album will stand the test of time, and will be known around the world, for decades to come. A brilliant work of art! Simply stunning, and incredibly moving."
4,Scope,The item fit perfect and delivery of the item was faster than expected. The finish of the product was great and len cleaner and wipe were included with the product which was unexpected.
3,"A nice looking simple boot, especially for the price, but runs very small/narrow","For the price, these are very nice looking boots. Simple but attractive. Support is pretty minimal, which will be a negative for some.That said, I couldn't wear mine and sent them back. These run VERY narrow in the toebox, and also seem to run short. Buying a half size larger then your real fit might help, but that toebox is still gonna be pretty tight for many.Too bad..."
1,Bad Sole,The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use. I won't recommend it to anyone.
5,looooooooooooooooooooooooooved it!!!!!!!!!,"I loooooved and it was worth buying.The best tracks are Baby girl,Understanding,Gots ta be,Why I love You, Uh Huh,Shorty and the list goes on. I loove them so much and they will be the best group ever!!!!!!!!!Loooved it-Danisha a.k.a b2kfan4lyfe"
4,Shake it up,"My Sheltie has been enjoying Vita-Derm for years! The one thing I've learned is that you MUST shake the bottle like a paint can, because the ingredients separate. I even store it sideways. Also, I was told by several retailers to STOCK UP. It's being discontinued."
2,needs to self stand,definately needs to have a self standing feature for the freezer. i couldn't believe the manufacturer actually states in the instructions that you should place the bag in a coffee cup in the fridge or freezer... can't they figure out that their product simply needs this added feature?
3,"won't stand up, bad twist ties","they freeze well but you have to place them in a coffee cup or something so they won't tip over. they do not stand up on their own. also the twist ties are terrible. i heard gerber is a much better brand but i got hundreds of these and just used them instead of bothering to go out and buy something different. if i had it to do over again, i would not buy this product."
2,"Don't stand, don't seal!","I did not like these bags for three reasons: (1) they don't seal well - you have to remove the air and then roll the bags down with the twist tie; (2) the bags are oddly shaped and don't stand up in the freezer; (3) THEY LEAK when thawing. I have had more than one bag leak in the thawing process. Those that didn't leak then leaked when I was transfering the milk. I much prefer the Gerber bags. They stand up on their own, the have the ziplock seal and I haven't had one leak."
1,Medela needs to come up w/ something else,"I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them. These were just about the worst!! My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding. I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped. I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day. I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain. They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt. I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them."
4,Not to Hard to Use,"I didn't find that these bags were very hard to use. I liked that the labeling area was on the bottom and not where the milk is being stored so there was no risk of ink contamination. The twist tie wasn't too tricky unless I tried to store 5 ounces or a little more. (They are only made to store 5 ounces.) I haven't tryed to thaw the milk yet but they didn't leak as they were being froze. I like using them and there is no need to use another container to collect the milk, the bags hook right onto the collection device."
1,Nothing like having your milk leak all over your fridge,"I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion. I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me. Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!"
1,horrible bags,"This bags are absolutelly horrible they don't close right, I have already spilled milk all over and also if you keep them in the freezer or fridge nothing guarantees you that the milk is going to be sterile since the bag does not close properly and does not use a zipper. I found that Lansinoh breatmilk storage bags are way better they come with a double zipper that seals the bag for extra security, don't waste your money on these bags."
2,leaks,I do not like these bags. The twist tie closure system is cumbersome. The bags are small. The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen. The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
2,Not easy to use,"I've used the Gerber, Lansinoh and these CSF bags and I have to say that the CSF are the worst. The twist-tie method really does stink. Lansinoh is much more sturdier, easier to pour milk into and the double ziploc action is great. Plus the thickness of the bags is better. The CSF bags don't stand up on their own so you need a cup to keep them upright while you fold the bag over the twist ties, ugh..I can't be bothered. And the whole cutting of the bag on the bottom, what a pain. Isn't it easier to just open up a ziploc-type Lansinoh bag and pour it into the bottle?"
1,Does NOT play DVD's from all regions,"I ordered this from Tiger Direct. It does NOT play DVD's from all regions. It does have PAL or NTSC output, but will not accept DVD's of other regions. I specifically bought this to play region 2 DVD's so it is worthless to me. The returns policy at Tiger Direct is so difficult that I will probably give it away rather than go through the process. This was a complete waste of $50 for me."
2,Not worth it,"I'm sorry fans, but I found the CD to be monotonous and lacking in any visible signs of musical talent. I have read comments stating that it's good background music, not exactly meant to be 'listened' to -- and that's from a fan. He went on to say, you know, it's for clubs, implying that the standards for its quality not be as high. Thank you again -- helping me make my point.I did like Velvet Pants I admit, but think it's absurd that this CD gets about 80 reviews, mostly positive, while the immensely more talented Doves get only about 30 reviews on ""Lost Souls.""Anyway, I admit dance/funk/electronica/hip-hop (sounds like an identity crisis) is not my bag but I gave it an honest listen. I would wholeheartedly recommend the first 5 albums by the Stranglers, Alex Gifford's former band instead."
2,LETDOWN!!,"Basically, just download ""Take California"", ""History Repeating"" and ""Spybreak!"". Otherwise, this disk is as repetitive and unoriginal as the latest from Britney Spears."
4,FUN & PRACTICAL,"I WANTED FLOOR MATS FOR MY CAR THAT SHOWED THE LIGHTER, FUN SIDE OF ME--THESE ADORABLE MATS ACCOMPLISHED THAT GOAL. THE MATS ARE ALSO DURABLE, AND SHOULD PROTECT THE FLOORING IN THE CAR FOR YEARS TO COME."
3,Came quickly,"The articles I came arrive very quickly, but the material seems somewhat cheap. Not going to hold up through the harsh winters here."
2,Oriole Feeder,"I am sorry to say that this feeder was a waste of money. Orioles were attacted to my yard via hummingbird feeders. Unfortunately, the hummingbird feeders attracted bees....lots of bees! I ordered different hummingbird feeder which worked in keeping bees away and keeping hummingbirds visiting feeders. I ordered this oriole feeder in hopes of keeping these beautiful birds coming to my yard and eliminating bee problem. Even though this product has bee guards, bees were attacted to it. It appears when the oriole feed on nector, the nector got on the bee guards thus attracting lots of bees. Had to take it down and unfortunately lost the orioles coming to my yard."
5,Best Oriole feeder on the market,I love these and only able to find them on line. Great prices and free shipping. What I love the most about them is the bees aren't able to get inside them like the other types do. Highly recommend this product.
1,Not the same,"Since the product I received was not the same as the picture, I can't really review it. The one I got is almost the same but the bee guards are little spring loaded buttons that almost cover the feeding hole. I say almost because the button leave a space that allows bees to get to the nectar. I finally had to take the feeder down because it would be completely covered with bees and a nuisance around the patio area. If ever a feeder with a ""real"" bee guard is manufactured I'll be the first in line to buy it. As for the one I got, I give it a thumbs down."
4,Orioles love it!,The orioles love this feeder and my hummers pretty much leave it alone. It keeps wasps and flies out. The only drawback is it leaks in the wind. I like it overall!
4,Cute and clever book about friendship and a snow day.,"I read this book to my 5 and 6 year old boys, and in spite of the fact that it is about two girls, they listened to every word and laughed a lot. We first read ""The Shortest Kid in the World"" by the same author, which they equally enjoyed. The characters in both books are the same; clever and funny stories about friendship and overcoming certain childhood insecurities. Great books for boys and girls alike - especially emerging young readers. I will read these both to my son's first grade class."
5,Just as shown,I bought this Star Rocket lamp for my soon-to-be arriving son's room. It's exactly as pictured. Makes a very nice addition to the rocketship theme we are using in the room.
4,It's not a just easy way. It's an ultimate way !!,"This book is great! You may become a master of lines, points, angles, circles, triangles, polygons ... by reading this book from the first page to the last page sequentially.The book contains some typos but those are not major errors.Solid geometry part is somewhat disappointing but everything else is great !I want to add one more property of proportions, if a/b=c/d then(a+c)/(b+d)=a/b=c/d."
1,Not laughing,"John Ritter, Audrey Hepburn...and I used to like Ben Gazara. How could this be so NOT funny? Well, it is boring and silly and not worth watching. They are all so obvious.. TRYING.. wisecracking, elbowing each other. Too bad I paid for this...should have taken the other reviewers more seriously. I hoped it might at least be ""pleasant"" to watch with professional actors I enjoy. NOT! One star."
4,Charm...and lots of it,A wonderful light romantic comedy to pass the time. John Ritter and Audrey Hepburn stand out as the brilliant talents they were.
1,What a Disappointment,"I purchased this movie because I am a big Audrey Hepburn fan. I was so disappointed with the movie. Audrey Hepburn was well past her prime when she made this. She had lost the spark she had in her younger days. There is not much of a plot. Ben Gazarra was terrible. He just wallked around with a smirk on his face and all the women he knew were supposedly smitten with him. He was so miscast in that role. He is a short man and not very masculine. It is hard to imagine women swooning over him. I regret having wasted my time watching this. It did have a good soundtrack and John Ritter was funny as a klutz, and Dorothy Stratton was beautiful, but not too believable. All in all I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Solid Airsoft,"Good gun. Feels natural for adult-sized person. Perfect for anyone who is an occasional player or semi-serous. Hi-cap mag is a little strange at first compared to normal cap. mags, but you get used to it. Stock battery and charger sucks: 4.8 hours (calculated) to charge, and the gun takes about 3 mA/shot, so the included battery is only good for about 400-600 shots (about a mag and a half). Reccomend a 3000 or 3500 mAH battery and a better charger (atleast .9 mA output). Uses 9.6 V battery. Has swivel mounts on it, so a sling might not be a bad idea. Stock scope is a waste, and I'm thinking about rigging it to be a red dot scope.Good power, Good price ($100), good accuracy. You'll probably want to buy alot of .2g BB's though. I chewed through hundreds of rounds in just a few minutes in practice."
5,"""I Can Do It""","This is another wonderful book by Louise Hay. I especially love the CD that comes with the book. With such inspirational and caring words in her book, it is also tremendous to hear her read the words in her own voice. I would highly recommend this author and this book."
3,Soft yet hard to put on,"I like the feel of this sheet, but it is difficult to put on the bed because it is a bit smaller than it should be. Pottery Barn Kids sheets fit much better."
4,TDK DVD lens cleaner,Worked well. DVDs no longer freeze/pause after using this just once. Certainly worth it rather than having to get another player.
5,Order it from Vault.com,"This is a great book, but if you need it right away and don't want to pay a special handling fee order it directly from Vault.com. The eBook version is also available there as well as the new 2003 edition that is not available yet in bookstores."
5,A rich find,"Dr Eberhard's volume offers a comprehensive & scholarly treatment of a difficult but timely subject. It is loaded with information on development and developmental plasticity I expect many ecologists, animal behaviorists, and evolutionary biologists will find very useful.---Kay Holekamp"
2,OK but who's going to read this ?,"I have a PhD in biochemistry (meaning I can understand a reasonable amount of jargon) and hoped that with this book I'd be able to understand what modern developmental biology (in particular developmental genetics, ""evo-devo"", etc.) is about, but this book bored me to death. There is no continuum, no logical progression in the teaching. When you reach the end of a chapter you've forgotten what it was about. I admire the central concept and the work but, frankly, as a book it's completely missed. It is not a textbook, it is not a popularization book, it's a 600+pages small print dissertation. Who wants to read that ? Who has the time to go to the library and check the details of any of the hundreds of referenced articles (all of them are treated only superficially) ? Not students, not professional scientists (their time would be better spent reading review articles), not laypersons. Who then ?"
1,CISM Prep Guide - A Complete Failure,"This book was literally a cut and paste of the author's previous work. I just took the CISM exam, and if I had assumed this book could help me pass the test, I would have failed. This is NOT the CISSP, and the fact that they could not take the time to remove references to ""studying for the CISSP"", in this book tells me it was glued together, and that is being VERY kind.DO NOT WASTE A DIME ON THIS BOOK!!!"
2,don't think it works,I don't think this product works. I just think it quiets baby for a while because it's sweet.
4,Indigo Girls go back to their roots,The Indigo Girls are once again doing what they do best. Harmony and acoustic guitar combine to create a wonderful CD. Amy and Emily have rarely failed their fans. I don't think that you will be disappointed by this CD.
2,One good song & a lot of filler...,"I'm bummed about this one. I heard a concert they did & was drawn into buying this. there are a lot better Indigo Girls albums out there, they don't sound as together as they used to. The writing isn't working... Of course I really liked Swamp Ophelia, so what do I know..."
1,Golden Flax Crackers,"These were stale and tasteless. I do not intend to spend my money on any more. I cannot eat wheat, dairy, food additives, or sugar so the items that I can eat are very limited. These were certainly not worth the money and were a huge disappointment."
1,Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms,"I did not recive the book. It is more than one month, they made mistake with the delevery and I pay the delay of it"
3,"""A Nice, Quick Read""","One of Hillerman's few stories that doesn't take place on the Navajo Reservation. Here, newspaper reporter John Cotton stumbles onto a story of government corruption that has already led to the death of a friend and fellow reporter. It was kind of difficult to figure out where his investigation was going in the first half of the book. Things did start to make sense in the second half. Also, drama started to go up a bit. More should have been done to flesh out Cotton and other characters. You mainly see him as a reporter, not a human being. It also would have been nice if the city and state where the story took place was named. Still, all in all, it was an okay book."
3,"so-so, not very funky, chilled, or remixed at all","So-so. I can't hear much (or any, really) Jazzanova influence, it just sounds like standard Blue Note jazz, if that's your thing... no hipster stylings to it, just kind of dull middle aged jazz tunes. I wish Jazzanova had worked more of their magic on these cuts!So if you are expecting something chillout, downtempo, electronica, etc, you'll be disappointed. But if you want straight jazz, get it."
5,What an awesome book!,"This book answered so many questions I had about how the Internet works and how enterprises can use BGP in their networks. The writing style is clear and a pleasure to read. I did not notice any errors or typos. This is one of the best Cisco Press books I've read. The material covered is a logical extension (fill-the-gaps) for the knowledge one gains when studying BGP as part of the CCNP/CCDP BSCI exam. The case studies for enterprise BGP core design and Internet connectivity were one of the most interesting and useful real-world scenarios one can strive to implement. Same for the service provider examples. One caution however, this is not ""beginner"" material. One would greatly benefit from having a CCNP-level understanding of BGP prior to attacking this book."
3,Songs Faded In,"I ordered this for a song I was desperate to get, Always There by Side Effect. Unfortunately, the songs blend from one to another, so I'm not able to fully isolate that song. Very disappointing."
3,"What exactly is a ""scientific approach""?","Just because something is new, high tech, or pharmaceutical doesn't make it truly scientfiic, except perhaps in the worst sense of the word. Anyway , this isn't even new any more. The great underlying problem is with chemistry in general: Man-made substances with -not- completely understood effects are -not- the optimal human diet. Anything other than healthy aging is the result of substances that should not be in the body in the first place. Drinking clean water, eating fresh whole organic fruits and green leafy vegetables, allowing yourself as much rest and as much sleep as you need, regular exercise, and clearing up the loose ends in your financial and emotional life, will keep you lean, and clean every internal system, allowing to you fool mother nature into thinking you're still young well into your 80s, without worrying about which chemical is going to come back and get you. Short cuts are second best, at best."
1,Into the Storm:is a terrible book about a fascinating battle,"I have read all of Clancy's books. He should be embarassed his name is one this one, his portion of this book is mediocre. Franks writing ""style"" if you can call it ""a style"" is not only boring but patently self serving. As a genuine war hero Franks should have used a first class writing assistant. This great battle in American War History deserves far better than this very poorly written and confusing book. Hopefully,someone of the caliber of Stephen Ambrose will give the men and women of Desert Storm what they deserve - An exhilerating fast paced action narrative history of the people, logistics and strategy of this great battle."
2,This Book is Outside the Zone of Learnability!,"If you want to learn about brain-based learning, there are easier books to read. Yes, I learned a lot by reading it, but each chapter took me 2 hours to read. My classmates agree. Many times, I'd have to read it aloud to understand it. I've been to college; later I returned for a certification in education; and now I'm getting my masters. This is the hardest book I've ever encountered!"
2,Not the best description of the book for the price,"In talking with peers, I paid too much for this book for the condition it was in. I would have said it was in low fair, maybe even poor condition."
1,Crab hate it,I upgraded the crabs tank from the tiny thing it gets when you buy one on the boardwalk to an actual tank and purchased this to replace the food they sold us which was basically gone by the end of the vacation. well its been some time now since i put this in the tank and he still has not touched it at all. The only thing this crab seems to eat is the driftwood in the tank. Wont eat fruits or veggies either and im amazed its even still alive.
2,tweetybird mug bad ol puddy that,I have recived a tweetybird mug that was not the one I ordered from you this one has the same pic but it says tweetybird and it is only 14oz the tweetybird mug I ordered was the tweetybird mug that said Bad ol putty that how did I get the wrong mug and you should send me the right mug and I shouldn't have to pay for your mistake the tweetybird mug I ordered was 15ozthe item model # is 613500 ASIN: B000P307RE and the shipping weight is 2.2 pounds and the tweetybird mug that I recived was 2 pounds and the item model # is F731931 TWEETY please look at the words Bad ol putty this is the mug you have advertised on the intenet
3,Some bands are better live. Some aren't.,"Most of this album is the revisioned folk I know and love from Varttina; those parts of the album are excellent songs that, unfortunately, just don't live up to their potential in these live versions.A few songs on here, though, are material that hasn't appeared on their albums and is stylistically very different; to be blunt, it sounds more like generic European dance/pop. Mie Tahon Tannsia and Laulutytto are the examples that come to mind. Maybe you'll like them. I don't."
2,Vtech game,"Very poor quality, it broke within 3 months, game just quit working but my other games still work so I know it is the game and not the cyber pocket.vtech has poor quality, I am also on my 4th cyber pocket but I have so much money stick into the games I hate to not have th cyber pocket. My 4 and 6 year old did love it the short time it worked."
2,"Ok, I guess",They are nice pillows especailly for the price. I was looking for something with removeable covers that can go in the wash. These covers are not removeable. Spot clean only.
4,Beautiful product,"My mom opened this Christmas gift yesterday and loved it. A little early, but she is 84 and can do what she wants. It is well constructed, beautiful to look at and will be easy to place outdoors. Cannot say how well it will handle the Michigan winters yet but looks to be okay and easy to clean."
3,From Back Cover,"Through the sultry heat and Spanish moss of the Louisiana bayou, three teens witnessed a friend's murder. Bringing the killer to justice, they become blood brothers. From boys to men, nothing could break that bond... except a killer's revenge.Bayou Blood Brothers - Their secrets are darker.. their passions run deeper.TYLER by Rebecca York: the street-kid-turned fed. On his last case for the Bureau, Tyler hadn't counted on being sold out - nor on taking the beautiful Gabby Lanier, his dead friend's sister, as his hostage.NICK by Metsy Hingle: the privileged one. It wa hard enough returning to the bayou for the wedding of Nick's only love, Caroline Donovan. Even worse to find himself falsely accused of murdering the groom.JULES by Joanna Wayne: the bayou bad boy. He tried to bury the past - but passion for his first lover, the wealthy Adrienne Breaux, wouldn't die. Nor would the man who vowed sweet revenge on him and his friends..."
1,"editor, do your job!","This is one of the most embarrassingly bad pieces of writing recently published in the genre. I honestly do not understand what the editor was doing or how this landed publication with Tor. The author has a tremendous amount of great ideas but he simply does not know what to do with them: in fact, he does not know how to write. The subplot is hilariously contrived. The writing itself is stacked with adverbs, adjectives and similes. There is not a single paragraph that does not need some form of reworking. Some sentences are shockingly poor. On average, this book has the tone of a slightly confused writing exercise, and I exemplify: ""Then, realizing in full what he was holding in his unworthy hand, he dropped the parchment to the desk with a quiet yelp."" I wish the author had been assigned a competent editor who is not afraid of using a read marker because the ideas are there. But the writing? Atrocious."
5,Fantastic Introduction,"This is an excellent novel. I spent 2 weeks reading the first past of the novel. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the book, but I was taking in the chapters and letting them dissolve mentally throughout the time period. Once I got into part 2 of the book, the speed accelerated, the dynamics increased, and it became a book that I could not put down. I read the last 200 pages in one evening, whereas I spent 2 weeks on the first 400. There are moments in the story that I honestly did not see coming.Brandon Sanderson is a great talent, and I have previously enjoyed his first Mistborn novel, which is also very well written. This is a must own and a must read. I buy books that I will read and return to the book store for credit on other books if it does not seem to grab me. This will be one of the least dusty books in my collection. Well done, and I look for further reading within Sanderson's universe."
3,Elantris,"Started this because I'm Jordan and Stanek fan. Stanek has written much about once great races and peoples brought to the end, to the last, and Sanderson's style of moving from one vantage point to another is something Stanek masters so well. Like Stanek's works, the story doesn't revolve around a single problem, rather a number of problems. Ultimately, the story of the Elantrans, and their once great race is deep, with plenty of plot twists and turns. It begins when a prince deeply loved by his people, shows signs of the changing curse, is pronounced ""dead,"" and then is thrown into the old city of Elantris with the rest of those ""changed"" like him. The city used to contain god-like humans, but it now holds cursed humans. The prince wants to restore its former glory of Elantris and studies Aons, Elantrian magic to do it."
5,great standalone fantasy,"This was the first Sanderson book that I read. I was immediately hooked in the first chapter of the book by the world building and interesting characters; the mystery of the Elantrians and the political maneuverings of the different parties kept me interested throughout the rest book. Sanderson writes in a clean readable style without watering down his prose, he is truly the rising star of great Fantasy literature. This book is not only for fans of fantasy but for anyone who enjoys great plot, pacing, characters, and adventure. As a final note, if you happen to read this (""you"" being Brandon) I am begging you to continue the story of Elantris after the Wheel is done."
3,"Good book, nothing great","Started collecting Brandon Sanderson books, so I bought this and 2 mistborn. This one is just ok. Good to read once, probably wont read it again. Not a compelling book to ready multiple times like WOT. Just hope the WOT series continues to be readable"
3,Sleek but shallow,"A smooth, sensual trip-hop group supplied this disc of wonderful, though background-music sensibilities. A counterpoint to Portishead's sluggish, depressive state, Laika's crisp, offbeat drum patterns navigate proper female vocals through these spinning celebrations. Pattern-driven though it may be, the experience is immersive enough to enjoy in the moment but repeated listening can prove underwhelming."
2,Textbook formatting is a disappointment on Kindle,"I love this book. I highly recommend it. My problem is with the format of the Kindle version. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE my KIndle!!! Kindle is just not suited to eTextbooks. The next semester's book I got on NookStudy. The formatting was much better. I wish Kindle could format with page numbers, at least for textbooks, so that it easier for students to follow. I do not own a Nook because I do prefer the Kindle device, but I downloaded the free app for my PC. Nook does better with textbooks."
5,Nonforgetable!,I remember in fifth grade (5 years ago) my teacher read out loud to the class. This is probably the most unforgetable book I've ever read. Gary PLaulsen creats sepctacular images in this book. I was 9 when i was read the book and it has made a lasting impression on my life.
2,nightjohn is not my type of book but it is very good,"Slavery, this word is in the past but Nightjohn brings it back. it tells how cruel blacks were treated and how brave Nightjohn was to come back and teach the slaves to write and read"
4,This book is awesome.,"I recommend the book NightJohn to anyone that likes books about slavery. This book takes place in the 1800's during slavery times. It is about a 12 year old slave girl named Sarney. She was separated from her mother when she was four years old and she was raised by a woman named Old Delie. Sarney's job was to chew tobacco spit on the rose bushes,to get rid of aphids.Sarney wanted to learn how to read and write. Then Clell Waller buys a new slave named Nightjohn. He teaches Sarney how to read and write. Until one day he gets caught,so if you want to find what happens you need to read the book. I give this book two thumbs up."
5,Inspirational,"This book changed the way i thought about parenting i loved everything about it and i loved the christian approach that it had because it was the right balance of it, it wasnt overly religious where it was irritating to read, and it didnt just throw around the bible when it was convenient to make a point, and at the same time it stuck to the subject of parenting and ultimately gave timeless advice ^_^ i loved it!!! <3 <3"
1,Another child abuse manual,"Beat the child with a rod (ie. flexible branch from a tree) because it produces the greatest amount of pain. ""...bring pain in order to produce repentance."" ""The spanking must go beyond the point of anger. Itmust evoke a wholesome fear in the child.""The message from the author is beat them hard and long, create fear in your child. Perhaps the saddest thing is that he uses God as his excuse to advocate for abusive parental behavior.One could seriously cause their child physical, emotional and sexual harm with this book. It shouldn't be sold at Amazon or at any respectable book store."
1,Child Abuse Is Not Discipline,"It's a shame that entirely too many people spend their time reading and believing garbage like this. Educate yourselves people into how much damage this can actually do to children. Instead of taking the easy way out and abusing your children, why not actually teach them instead??? As far as people saying I had this done to me & I turned out fine, I'd be willing to bet that you turned into a violent child abuser as well. And shame on this author for making money at the expense of children's lives!!"
1,poor quality control,"I found the same thing as the other reviewer. I only bought two: Black (x-heavy) and Blue (heavy). My thinking was that I'm a big guy so I might need the x-heavy one, but I wanted to make sure that I got one that worked (for tennis elbow) so I also got the next one down on the force scale, the heavy one. I was surprised to find that the Blue bar that was supposed to be easier was harder to bend than the Black bar. Both bars are too stiff to be used for tennis elbow. Having wasted my money on a product that didn't come close to working I'll try once last time with the Thera-Band product (hoping that I pick the right one)."
3,Heavy duty forearm muscle worker,I bought the blue bar to help improve muscle flexibility and strength within my arms. The bar is a little hard & stiff but it works for me to challenge my muscles for normal office use. It does the job for what I need so I can't complain!
2,Book is Missing Pages 33-40,"I received this book yesterday as it is required reading for a college course I'm taking. I just realized that pages 33-40 are missing. They are not torn out, they are just not there. This book seems to be in new condition otherwise, and I believed it was new when I bought it. I'm thinking it may have been a printing problem. Extremely disappointing."
3,good......but......,this cd is realy good.... i love the beats.. but the robot voices arent the best.... its too much of the same things over and over....but its still good... sort of car music to shake your subwoofers!...... its good....but its not very original
1,An example of bad techno,"Well i'm a huge fan of dance music in general and i liked ""Satisfaction"" so i thought the rest of the album would be fun too, but the rest is a repetitition of tye hit single. They all sound the same, i got the feeling that it didn't take them very long to record the album either. Sure, Daft Punk got their sound and so got Modjo and other artists but this is crazy, the songs areso simular it's annoying. First those computerized beats frtom ""Satisfaction"" then robotic voices. That's pretty much it. 2 songs were a little diffent from the rest though, but not enough for buying the album."
4,Near perfect,I read the other reviews and bought it. Although many of the tracks have a somewhat similar synth bassline and drum pattern there is still sufficient variety to make this an outstanding acquisition to any dance collection. 'Love Is Gonna Save Us' is quite simply one of the best dance songs I've ever heard; brutal bassline and heavy synths. Collection reminds me of a cross between Kraftwerk and Oakenfold. Would have earned 5 stars if it has just a little more variation.
3,small!,"I'm usually a size seven and a half and the reviews said it ran small, so i ordered a size eight. they were still too small. a nine would have fit much better. other than that, they were HOT, very tall, and i got lots of attention."
4,Ramsey Code practice Oscillator,"This item was sent by the vendors schedule and was in a huge box, I expected a padded envelope. It took less than 1 hr to assemble, including a 1/8 in phone jack addition so I couuld use my key. It is low in volume but it is loud enough for keying practice."
5,Great show,"great fighters = great event. This Pride has a superstar lineup, and some very entertaining fights, submissions and K.O.s This is my favorite Pride event. If you like action, and I know you do, you'll love this one.Get it, and you'll be glad you did."
5,Packers Pine Tar Soap,"This product is as good as I remembered it from my youth, lots of cleansing suds and the beautiful scent of pine.It's like showering in the middle of a pine forest and your hair is totally clean with no chemical residue."
2,It's okay,I purchased this CD just for two songs - Once Upon a Dream and My Hawaii both are songs that I love but I have to admit both songs are a bit dated. Singin' the Blues Too Long is the only other song I care much about. The rest is just filler in my opinion.
2,"Fit great, but not for long.","This was my second pair of these WL work gloves. I really like the fit and the grip is excellent. So what's not to love? Unfortunately, these gloves don't last more than a few uses. My first pair broke down after 4 or 5 uses, which I thought had to be a fluke. The second pair wore out the finger tips after being used 3 times in the fall to stack firewood and clear light brush. My guess is that any contact with moisture weakens the leather to the point that it just disintegrates."
3,Libro con muchas preguntas y respuestas,"Este libro es bueno pero lo que no me gusto es que practicamente todo el libro es con preguntas y respuestas,para mi es importante,pero a la vez me interesa un libro donde yo pueda leer mas acerca del embarazo...sin necesidad de tener tantas preguntas ahhh y otra cosa es que hablan de un tema y despues dice vaya a la pagina .....(el numero) para leer mas al respecto,eso tampoco me gusto,porque te la pasas de una pagina a otra, prefiero libros con informacion en la misma pagina o capitulo.en general te saca de muchas dudas,y cosas importantes que toda futura madre desea saber."
5,"Excellent Scope, Great Value.","I received this as a Christmas present. I use it almost exclusively for bird watching from inside my house, through a large window. It's tripod mounted, and perfectly balanced. It doesn't tend to drop forward like other large scopes. With the standard adaptors, a small Chickadee at 50 feet completly fills the scope's field of view. I can see even the tiniest details. I love this scope!"
4,Olympus C-5060 @ Bytesector.com,"Big, bulky and black; that's how I see the Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom digital camera. This is no pocket sized camera, and it shouldn't be either since it is feature packed. With a 5.1 mega pixel capacity, 14x zoom, rotating view-finder and attachable wide conversion lens, this camera out perfoms many. Sounds great doesn't it, now let's see if it is........."
1,My first camera was an Olympus OM-1 SLR - Still works unlike my 5060,I loved my 5060 until the menu system failed the second time. Just a year after repair and three years of ownership. Dissapointing reliability performance. I don't yet understand how long a digital camera should last. My expectation is 5 years without issues for cameras above $300. That may be unrealistic. I don't love Olympus anymore and poor servcie from a long standing company can not be tolerated by consumers. I will not buy another Olympus until they have proven to be loyal to me and you.
4,Sweet little book,Unfortunately this book is out of print. It is an excellent book for a course or self study for the chemistry major or other student who wishes to prepare for qm in the dreaded P-Chem course. Studying it may precede thermodynamics.
3,long,My daughter loved the ribbon; however it is a little long and heavy for a 3 year old. Should be fine for older kids though.
4,Israel Inside,"It was good, it provides the precursors to what leads to achievement and accomplishment. Rather than focusing on how to avoid problems, it explains how to make things better."
5,SVGA male to male 3ft.,This item was very good for connecting a VGA switch box to my computer. It was well made and performed well when switching between computer monitors and TV.
2,defective?,"This cord seemed to be working but I noticed that my pc was not recognizing the monitor, and was showing up as a generic that had a lower resolution than was possible. I thought it was the switch I bought at the same time so I could connect my TV to my pc as well as my monitor. I happened to have another monitor cord, connected it and then the pc ""saw"" my monitor and I was able to set the resolution to max. Since this cord was used to connect from pc to switch, it affected monitor and TV resolution quality. I am guessing a defective conductor or connection. Not worth the hassle to return, so I'm out five bucks."
5,Johnny Reid Live: Heart and Soul,This DVD is incredible!!! It is one you can listen to over and over again and never tire......Buy it !!!
5,Buy It,"I am not a music critic just a lover of all kinds of music and I cannot get enough of Jonny Reid. What A talent. I live in the US and hope he eventually gets close to me. In the while , I will continue to enjoy his fabulous music."
2,Not very good,"I bought this at Walgreens a year ago. I wish I hadn't. The humidifier seems OK at first with the mentol because you can easily detect menthol. But really this isn't doing much at all. It doesn't push moisture in the air whatsoever when my Sunbeam did. The difference was that you can feel the water on the Sunbeam, and on the Halls version you couldn't. This means that all your getting is a menthol treatment that you could easily get from a cough drop or two. Not recommended unless you just have a cough, not a cold."
5,Bobrick,"Great item, Fast shipping, I ordered these to match what was already installed and they look great perfect match.Would buy again."
3,Elegant but no water proof,"Nice looking and elegant, rich material, but not water proof as stated. This is the part I am disappointed about because I purchased it to put my bike in the backyard in winter and give the garage parking to my wife. Now when it rains it gets all the water on the bike. Great if you don't care about water proof"
2,Small,"If your Motorcycle has ferrings, get a larger size. I have yet to return the too small one, looks like good quality for a couple of years. Our main goal: protection in rain and sun, and wind --blowing off in the rain is not so good ... cannot check how bottom latches work yet.--Californian"
5,My 8th graders loved these.,I used this for the last days of school...my students kept wanting me to do more of these with them. I only started out doing a few that day but they begged me to continue. It was so much fun seeing the smiles on their faces.
2,shallow,"I bought this dvd because of some of the reviews and I was sorry. The acting, especially the actress', was shallow and unbelievable. How did they fall so deeply in love from just a few conversations? Anyway, my wife chastised me for crying at the end (maybe I was crying over the waste of money?). Now how am I going to get rid of it. The actress made it sound like she would be able to WALK again, so what's the big detail, more time in rehab? I thought that Matrix had a more star-crossed relationship between Trinity and Neo."
1,"Great movie, poor digital quality",This is a great movie but I couldnt get past how poor the digital quality was. Well you get what you pay for.
1,error?,"I believe there is a bit of problem in this biography. It gives Gene Fowler (1931- ) credit for the book GOODNIGHT, SWEET PRINCE, a bio of John Barrymore. But, that book was first published in 1943, meaning that this Fowler would have been 12 at the time.I believe that the writer has confused Fowler the poet with Gene Fowler the newspaper columnist -- who lived from 1890 to 1960."
3,Not his best...,"Djavan has made music history... he has a unique story and career. This record is one of his worst, but still worth it. Listen to his songs, he has a great songbook."
5,Very Helpful Gadget,"This gadget is great for opening all types of small neck bottles: the type your wife brings you because you are a ""he-man"" and she cannot open. I am now no longer needed to open these bottles because she has this bottle opener. I have since purchase several of these to give as gifts when I see a friend or family struggling to untwist a top. I am now no longer a ""he man"" but I do not risk the damage to my reputation when I cannot open a particularly tight screw top. I recommend this product without reservation."
2,Don't even bother,"I absolutely love the call of duty series, but do not buy this game for the Wii.The graphics are pretty bad even if the Wii isn't a pwerhouse graphics console, look at Legend of Zelda, those graphics are pretty good for the Wii.The gameplay isn't so bad, but one of the most frustrating things about this game is aiming. Aiming is clunky and if you whip around to fast to get at someone behind you, the sensor might go off screen and send you turning. It gets really annoying. I played it at a friends house and put it down after maybe 10 minutes.Bottom Line - Do not waste your money on this game. I don't think the Wii was meant for shooters, it is for fun family and party games. That's why I have a Wii and a 360."
1,Terrible Play Control,"This game is horrible, if you have XBox360, purchase it for that system, as you will find the Wii controls way too cumbersome. The slightest shift of your hand results in the view on screen changing completely. Don't buy this game."
5,Reliable,"I've been wearing these socks for years and, although they are a bit pricey, they're the best for wearing with athletic shoes."
1,different than pictured and different size than in product description,"Arrived quickly. Not as pictured. pictured is the top 2/3's of wings with a beautiful maribu feather and white. received as fluffy maribu feather along top edge only about 1 inch. the rest of the feathers are the flat type shown on the bottom of product picture and are scraggly looking, not full, not even, not consistent. the bone of the feathers are a dark yellow so does not look very nice. kind of cheesy looking. size received is 18 inches wide by 18 inches long but product description stated 24 inches wide and 21 inches long. very dissapointed. totally not worth it at all."
2,get them from the store,i paid over $20 for 12 items that were pre-priced at .99 cents each. and on top of that they are kinda stale. i would have been better off buying another brand from my local store.
4,In step with Karma Collection,"If I could, I'd give this 4 1/2; since I can't, I gave a 4. For a large album, it does well. Only a few of the tracks are so-so, and even then, they are tolerable. If you are not familiar with the KC series, think chillout Indian and Middle Eastern style. A lot of sitar, a few songs in Hindi (I think), Arabic, or Farsi, etc... This is the overall feeling of the album. Also throw in a couple of African and Brazilian vibes here and there. I've played it at parties, and while I study or cook. It never disappoints. It's also a great a.m. drive to work album, as the title suggests.If you don't own any KC, get the original KC album first, just because that one is truly five stars!"
1,Waste of Money!,I am really disappointed with this product. It doesn't come out of the dispenser very well and the pictures I placed on the page fell off soon after I applied them. Do not waste your money!
1,I was there,"I was in the Dominican Republic at Escuela Caribe from Sept. '82 to Dec. '83. I knew David Scheeres, he lived in my house which was T.K.B. at the time. I don't know about Julia's home life, but I can tell you from first hand experience that she has fabricated a mixture of truth and fantasy in this book concerning the program. We did have boxing matches, but they were strictly between students as a last resort if those students could't get along. In the 16 months that I was in the D.R. I never witnessed a boxing match. I knew alot of the folks that she depicts in her book. My memory is pretty sharp, and I don't recall any of them acting as she says they did in her book. Although I went through the program, and I am posting here, that doesn't mean that I am a ""religious fanatic"". I want everyone to know that I haven't been to church in over 20 years, because I don't believe in organized religion. Don't be to quick to judge on this one.."
5,If you are convinced that you are 100% correct about religion:,I just finished reading Julia Scheeres' beautifully written memoir. Her story reinforced my belief that parents who believe they are 100% right about any ideology can destroy their children. Every couple who plans to have or adopt a child should read JESUS LAND first.Scheeres' memoir about being raised in a fundamentalist Christian home parallels the struggles of any child raised with absolute values and beliefs. When there is no space for questioning or original thought a child with a good mind is going to suffer. Scheeres had a good mind.
3,Good place to start,"I found this book quite useful to get me started on writing Gnu emacs Lisp. It is clear and fairly well organized, and far easier to deal with than the standard documentation, which I find lacks the level of organization needed for so large a language.By ""large"" I mean mainly the number of functions available. Lisp as a language is not really hard to learn; it is just so different from many programming languages that it requires a few days of effort to get to ""aha!"". After that it becomes easy.The drawback to this book is that it doesn't take you far enough. It is an excellent start, and having worked through it you should be able to find your way around in the online or other emacs Lisp documentation. However, it lacks an index of emacs Lisp functions, or other similar reference material. I find this unfortunate, but it's not a show-stopper because once you get through this book you will know enough to use other reference material."
3,Silly Science,"I bought this book as a joke gift for my friend, who has an essential psychedelic collection, because i was intrigued by the title. Before giving this book to my friend (a chemist) i noticed that some of the `techniques` seemed a little, well dodgy. The science is`nt entirely complete and there are steps included that are only safe to attempt with a chemist in a neutral environment. But as an anarchist statement it seemed pretty cool. Further analysis of the LSD manufacture proved successful, and is explained easier than A.Shugins Pikal. So therefor it is exactly as prescribed."
4,Works great,The wii's internal fan has a habit of burning out over time making gaming sessions over an hour impossible. This stand keeps the system cool and has a few extra features for good measure.
1,Run Away,Received the Dreamgear 4 in 1 cooling stand with high hopes only to have them crushed 5 minutes later as the fan quits working. Although the blue light still works it is completely esthetic and serves no useful purpose. I obviously do not recommend this productRun Away .................................................Fast!
2,Not impressed.,This item is poorly constructed. I was not at all impressed with the quality of the item for the price.
4,Does what it says,"This stand is exactly what it says it is. The only thing I don't like is the light has to be on for the fan to turn on, but it's not too bad. The fan isn't loud at all. I like that it charges rechargeable batteries and also hold the remote and a nunchuck. It plugs into the USB port in the back of the wii and it also has a USB port on the back of the stand so there's still an open one. It comes with an AC adapter to power it if it's close enough, but I don't use that. I like that it holds 5 games, but I don't like that the games are raised up."
4,Ruined indeed!,"A good read, informative and enlightening! This book was published after the author's death . . . to bad, I'ld like to thank him. We all need this kind of information in history so that we can avoid the same kinds of problems with mercury, arsenic and cadmium."
5,Essential resource on the topic,"This a a very important and interesting book, well planned and researched, and making a strong case. It is rational and easy to follow and cites some very good references.It underestimates the harmful effects of lead as it was published before Needleman's 1996 work showing the effect of lead on antisocial behaviour and Canfield's 2003 work showing ""normal"" lead levels of 10 seriously impair IQ . These 2 latter references magnify Gilfillan's case and make it overwhelming. Gilfillan includes some politically incorrect personal views, but don't let that distract from the meat of his message.[...]Dr Ben Balzer, member of the technical advisory board, The LEAD Group www.lead.org.au"
3,Early Telephone Sales Scam expose,"In the 70's I worked my way through college selling on the telephone so I was intrigued to come across Mr. Riemer's slim tome on the subject. The pitfalls of listening to telephone solicitors have been evident for some time now but this piece of investigative journalism was one of the first to ring the alarm. Riemer's book came about after his total immersion in the shady industry in the early 70's and he limns his experiences, some creepy, some hilarious, with a panache that frequently sails over the top in its avidity for its subject. He strives for an arch neo-noir tone that seems as much a spoof of the ""Whisper"" and ""Confidential"" tabloid journalism of the 50's as a sincere effort to expose a crooked industry. Mr. Riemer gets top marks for chutzpah and enthusiasm. By the way, I was relieved when this book informed me the organizations that I worked for way back then were all quite legitimate. A fun read albeit a dated one."
1,"Ummm, no.","Tried these. I pretty sure this is a joke. I thought this was an herbal remedy, but it is a HOMEOPATHIC remedy, which I have learned the hard way are not the same thing. Educate yourself on the difference, because I did not and now I feel stupid. Herbal remedies contain herbs, which under research can be an active ingredient. These contain what? 1 billionth of a billionth of a few real herbs plus lactose sugar. That is why you can basically give these to newborns, because all it really is is milk sugar. My little boy stopped crying because he thought I was giving him candy, not because this treated him. I know there are those who swear by this....it is a pure placebo effect my friends. Again, your kids are getting a sweet, so of course they stop crying for a while. Ice those gums and give 'em a good teether, don't get sucked into this."
4,Electricians Pocket Manual,This book is typical of the Audels books in that it fairly concisely covers the important areas of the topic. It is a resource book that most people could use for several years before needing to go to another reference for technical aspects.
1,Shame on Disney for Ruining P.L. Travers' Books!,"P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character. It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the ""real"" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons?? Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest. I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old. I agree with another reviewer--this is one of Disney's worst movies ever. [...]"
2,boring and annoying,"It's always nice to look at Andrews, but here she doesn't have much personality, she's more like one of those colorful loud dolls in Disneyland who wave and enthusiastically sing ""It's a Small World."" Van Dyke's grimmacing is annoying. This film was so boring that I could never watch much of it."
5,Mary Poppins,"My 2 and a half year old grandson sits through the movie. He dances around during the seen where the carosel horses leave the marry go round. I wasn't sure he was old enough for the movie, but he is and he loves it."
5,Mary Poppins DVD,This movie is an all time favorite of mine. The quality of the DVD is great and the price was right.
3,'merry bobbins steb in toime'........,"A great film for all the family but, as an Englishman, I am outraged by Dick Van Dyke's 'accent'........"
5,mary poppins,"Who could not like mary poppins, the quality is just what it should be and my grandchildren loved it, wish there would have been a sequel"
5,Mary Poppins (Two Disc 45th Anniversary Special Edition,"I had seen this many times when I was younger. In our family we had 8 children, my grandmother she would take one child at a time to see this movie at the theaters no matter how many times she would see it. It was a fabulous movie. A great movie of family life and how things can change. It was hilarious too. Especially with Dick Van Dyke in it."
3,a little dissapointed,"Mary Poppins is a wonderful tale which combines the very talented Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. It is a great story for both young and old. However this DVD is not what I expected although there were a few extras such as a game and a very brief making of documentary, it was not as indepth as some of the other Disney DVD's on the market. So its thumbs up for the film and a thumbs down for the DVD as a whole."
4,Australian author goes Disney.,I just found out the Travers is a fellow Aussie. Her books have been an inspiration to yound and old alike. An inspiring screen adaptation.
5,Beautiful Classic,"Purchase your copy of Mary Poppins before it goes in the Disney vault! This is a beautiful classic that young children will watch over and over again. When my youngest was in the hospital years ago, I used to sing him the songs from the movie as his IVs were being put in and it was the only thing that would soothe him. Highly recommend it for boys and girls 2 years old and up."
5,excellent!,it's perfect... i've always wanted to have this dvd!thank you!hey! i'm looking for yentl and fantasia too.... is you have it would you please let me know?!thanks again!
5,Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition),Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)Excellent video; my granddaughter just LOVES it; she has been watching it repeatedly since she received it. Highly recommend this movie for 3 years and up.
5,still a delight!,"I got this video for my 6yr old grandaughter - and even with all of the new amazing technology available, she absolutely loved this movie! She still talks about it and wants to watch it again. It was wonderful to share something from my childhood with her that she equally enjoyed without thinking it was ""old or outdated""."
5,Great buy!!,Great buy and shipped quickly! I love this movie and this edition was perfect for all the background information and still being able to enjoy the movie.
5,The Best,I saw this movie when I was just a kid and I loved it then. I saw it again now after so many years and I still loved it as much!! This is simply a great classic masterpiece that everyone should see and have!
2,lacks the funk,not as good as injected and fear of a wack planet but it is ok but not all that good. i think phunk junkeez got there sound rocking on injected but in this cd there sound isn't all that rockin. so buy injected first then buy this cd.
2,Alarm is 20 seconds only,"The alarm only sounds for 20 seconds, which i slept through on the first test."
2,Covered in mold,The Filter arrived covered in mold. Needless to say I do not reccomended buying from g&s drug co. Stay away from these guys.
5,Perfect for hanging halters on the pasture fence,I use these hangers on all of my pasture fences. They are portable. And they hold 4 halters which is the number of horses I have.
2,poor quality,These sheets are too big for our queen sized bed and wrinkle up. They also have pills all over which don't feel good on my skin. I am disappointed in the quality.
5,Great buy!,"Wow! I bought these a few weeks ago and finally got around to putting them on my bed last week. I love them! They're not as silky as I was expecting, but hey--for $20, I'm not complaining! The only thing I don't like is that I think they're made for really deep mattresses or something, because there's a lot of extra slack. That's all right, though--I love them!"
4,Christmas gift,We bought this gun for our 16 year old son who recently took an interest in Air Soft Guns. So far he LOVES it however he has only been able to use it on his target. The weather has been terrible to take it outside. He is anxiously awaiting his next battle with his friends. I am overall pleased with the purchase. I think the shipping charges are a little high. I would take that into consideration the next time I buy from this company.
4,Great Value,"You won't regret this purchase. Accurate, easy to handle. Sights are a bit crude, but with its fps and rate of fire you don't need 'em."
2,"It's OK, I Guess :-(",Well I have been a fanof the Tony Hawk seriespro skater 1 came out.Downhill jam isn't as greatas I thought it would be.It get's boring after the first 15 races andit seems like you're just playingthe same race every time just on a new course.This game was a BIG dissapointment
5,This is my boys all time favorite game,"This is my oldest 2 sons favorite game. They are 5 and 8. We have over 20 games, but they play this one everyday. (This and Super Smash Bros Brawl)."
2,Loved it on YouTube....,"Billy Connolly's look at Route 66 proved way more insightful than one might think- at least from what I could see on the Web. We were taken to places rarely visited in your typical 66 documentaries and we met folks rarely interviewed. I was therefore very disappointed when after a long,long wait the Blue-ray discs were either defective, or not for North America. The discs load, one can navigate the menu, but there is no access to the programs."
2,"A liberal, politically correct study","As a librarian and researcher of this topic, I feel that Edward P. Rich's Pazyryk Agenda has more unbiased information to offer than Ms. Pringle's study.Mr Rich's discussion of Ahnenerbe is the more extensive in scope, comparable to the writings of George Lincoln Rockwell. A real understanding of both of these phenomena is not possible without reading it."
3,DOES NOT FIT SPORT TRAC,Called westin and they verified that thier catalog is wrong. Will not fit 03 ford sport trac.
5,loved it,Great holiday movie with a happy theme and a great program for year round as well as the holiday season.
3,Meng Fei does it old school,"Kung Fu superstar Meng Fei stars in this kung fu story dealing with rebels trying to rise against the manchurian emperor and his band of fighters. Meng Fei must face off with a pair of sword masters, a 7-foot strong man (frankenstien like), and then he must face off with the emperor himself and his deadly toad style, complete with croaking and expanding stomach. very creative and quite enjoyable to. Meng Fei does it again."
4,Appropriate and priced right.,"This NIV Gift Bible is an appropriate and quality gift for Confirmation, Baptism, First Holy Communion and other Christian celebratory occasions.I was able to purhcase one for each of my confirmands because it is affordable.There is a very nice presentation page with room for multiple signers."
2,The Type is too Small on the NIV Gift Bible,The only problem we had with the purchase is the type being so much smaller than we expected; it is smaller than most standard gift Bibles we've recently purchased. Otherwise the product is what we expected.
2,Small print,"I wanted to buy bibles for my young daughters for Easter. I picked this bible because it was a 4 for 3 promotion and was inexpensive to begin with. The bad part is that the font is about 8 point, and my daughters wear glasses. I ended up having to buy 2 more bibles. Why didn't the bible warn us not to buy cheap bibles that are on sale? I guess I will give them as gifts to kids who have eagle eyes."
2,Low Quality Bible,"I purchased a leather bound NIV Gift & Award Bible, but was quite disappointed when the Bible I recieved was of poor quality plastic, and had no ""study helps."" Over all, I recieved a low quality Bible and was extremely disappointed!"
5,EXCELLENT VALUE,"The price on this item was excellent, and it was shipped to me promptly. I am very happy with this purchase"
4,agréable,Agréable moment que d'écouter ces mélodies au saxophone. Il manque ce genre de programme qu'on ne voit que très rarement en compilation. A quand Fausto Danieli au saxophone en compilation ou Max Greger dans Sax in Gold.
1,Oh brother,"Has this guy even studied history? I don't even know where to begin. But I know where to end - the book is awful. I had to give it one star, because zero isn't an option."
5,US GOVERNMENT! HELLOOOOOO?,"The US Government should make this book required reading for all law enforcement people before it is too late!I was able to look up Tulbure's documentations at my local library! Wow! No, Mr. President, Islam is NOT ""peace"" as you so ignorantly claimed! Educate yourself Mr. president!"
1,Absolutely The Worst !,"This program is waste of money. Works terrible, is clumsey and has few controls for any creativity. No support from the company. A very poorly written program. I will stay away from IMSI software altogether after this. This was a rip off."
5,Trash Theater,"This is a play written by Aleister Crowley that was never put into production. I was a theater student back in high school and I would say compared to more mainstream stuff like Shakspear this holds up surprisingly well as the writer, prophet Crowley, was an intelligent and charismatic man and a master of the English language. It is one of the worst stabs at Christianity ever penned. Crowley is somewhere between a mainstream literary genius and a legitimate psychopath. But after a lot of reading and research it makes me wonder if Crowley is really nothing more than hip and clever. If you're seriously interested in the occult the best source is Aleister Crowley- he didn't care as much whether or not he was so cool and what people thought of him and ironicly he ended up becoming an icon."
3,Good book.,"Kathleen Norris was an excellent writer, but there appear to be two. One reader earlier commented on this. You need to differentiate between these two authors. The earlier one died in the sixties and didn't write on religious themes."
1,JUST WATCH OUT,AFTER 8 MONTHS OF OWNING THIS TV WITCH STARTED OUT TO BE A GOOD TV THE PICTURE WENT OUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FACTORY WARNTEE 4 MONTHS LATER AND MANY PHONE CALLS TO THE COMPANY THE EXTENED WARNTEE TOOK OVER THEY DON'T HAVE PARTS FOR THEIR TVS SO IT COULDN'T BE FIXED AND YOU DON'T GET ALL YOUR MONEY ABACK IT ENDED UP COSTING $250. FOR A TV THAT DOSEN'T WORK SO GOOD LUCK WITH THIS TV YOU COULD BE GETTING TOOK
3,good deal over all.,"This is a really good deal on a really decent HDTV. This TV really excells at showing HD content (HD gaming, Blu-ray etc.) it has one big problem though. Standard defintion images comes in looking blurry and alil washed. This is not a problem if, like me, your only gonna use this as a PC monitor or if your only gonna watch HD content."
4,This book Is Really VERY good at teaching you algebra.,"Ok, I have got to tell you up front that I have NEVER been a Math wiz, but after reading this book I can do algebra. I have never really gotten the hang of algebra. However I will be starting College in the fall, and I knew that if I was to have a chance of making it Past the first few weeks, I'd better Learn Algebra, and fast! So, I found this book, and I was sceptical, but after only 10 pages or so, I started to get a grasp of how Algebra Really works. Now I have read the book, and now I have a good understanding of how Algebra works. (I CAN DO IT NOW!) I would recomend this book to anyone struggling in algebra. However I must warn you This book does OVER simplify things in a few cases. Just don't get confused, or sidetracked. That is the only reason I could not give this book a 5 star rating.In conclusion this book works."
2,Concepts clearly presented but too many disconcerting errors.,"The lay-out and range of topics are very attractive and useful for people who want to refresh their beginning algebra knowledge. However, in a quick read-through and working of about a third of the exercises, I found at least 5 errors in the text. Unfortunately, they were not obvious typos. Rather, they were errors that made me wonder whether I was mistaken in my understanding. As a mid-career, lateral-entry middle school math teacher who was already questioning her sanity, I lost a bit of sleep over some of these points until I could recheck my knowledge base in the morning.Maybe Barron's will do better with the 3rd edition."
5,"Fun, pleasant approach to mastering Algebra 1 !","Painless Algebra,Second Edition,2006 by Lynette Long can reconcile anystudent to a subject famous for its abstraction.It is really PAINLESS as claimed by the author who reminded us she hasgarnered over 20 years of teaching Math.Her showing thtat Math is a language in itself is quite visible; I knowit was a real discovery for me the`""Math Talk "" boxes. Here is an example :"" 4 - 3 four minus three ""I love her first sentence on page 3 : "" Algebra is a language. In many ways,mastering Algebra is like learning French, Italian, or German...""You get to practice every 3 or 4 pages what you have just learnedthrough the Brain Ticklers , just six or seven exercises to verifyyour understanding . The answers are given about twenty pages further.It is as much fun as doing crossword puzzles.I just hope she comes out with a second tome on Algebra 2."
3,Painless???,"Painless if you already know something about Algebra - this book starts out high and so you need to know more of the basics - wife read in it and complained right away, what is this and what is that? I said, don't ask me, I am trying to learn too..."
4,Painless Algebra,"This book is written in a very direct and non-threatening way, peppered with humor. My 13 year-old son enjoys the illustrations and practice examples in each chapter. I would highly reccommend this book for anyone struggling with Algebra."
2,Memorize Shortcuts - Comprehend Nothing,The author reduces algebra to a bunch of simplistic formulas to memorize. While this may get a student through the test tomorrow it does nothing to further true mastery or comprehension of the material that will allow them to grow with mathematics or apply the material when presented differently than the author of this books presents it.The thought that this book was suggested by my son's pre-algebra teacher makes me nauseated.
5,What a fun read!,"I LOVED this book. I really laughed out loud several times. Owning a Westie myself, the author really understands their quirky little personalities. The voice of Cody rings true on every level. I shed a few tears as well. I just might read it all over again now!"
2,Pricey,I tried them on at a shoe store and they were not comfortable enough to warrant the price. Expected more comfort for the price.
1,Very Uncomfortable,These things are about the most uncomfortable thing I have ever put om my feet. For the cost of therse things you can buy 2 pairs of Dockers.
5,Journey to the center of the Earth book review.,"This is an exiting book full of adventure. It is about three people named Hans, Professer Hardwigg and his nephew Harry. The story takes place when Professer Hardwigg discovers a piece of parchment with the name of a famous explorer that went to the center of the Earth. Professer Hardwigg wants to do the same. They climb in to Mt.Sneffles with a guide named Hans. They have lots of adventures with prehistoric animals and travel in places you wouldn't even expect. The ending is very exiting but you will have to read it to find out. I recomend this book to people who like adventure stories. I think it is a great book ."
3,Wasn't Exactly the most Entertaining game...,"My sister got this game as a gift, and once she finished it, she said I could play it. I started from the beginning, and I found it extremely boring. The whole thing was actually really boring; I just played the same mini game over and over, till I could buy a T.H.A.N.G. The only part I really liked was when Penny was a waitress serving pizza. That was very action-packed and fast moving.This game I recommend for younger kids, maybe kids from ages 7-9. As a 10 year old, I finished this in a weekend, while it took my sister weeks, and she thought it was awesome. So if you're looking for a nice Gameboy game for an 8 year old, yea, this would make a nice gift. : )"
2,Lousy,"I found this book to be far too predictable and, to be honest, quite boring. Though Mr. Banks is undoudtedly a fine writer, it seems as though he 'phoned it in' on this outing. At times it feels as if the story is heading in the right direction -particularly near the end - but then it hits a brick wall. I found the ending of the story very bland. What happened to Kathryn? What about Hazleton? All in all, a let down."
2,Where's the reaL ending?,"What happened here iain - did you get board or just loose the plot?Have to say I realy like this guys work (for the most part), but this book has so much promise, but just completely fails to deliver. It's as if the author got bored of the story and decided to most end it ASAP.Not is best by a long shot!"
2,Do not buy this to replace your VHS tape versions ...,"I had been looking forward to a DVD version of the Red Skelton TV specials, yet I'm disappointed that these are the shortened (edited for commercial & announcement time) versions which have several sections of each program removed, making them about 15 mins. shorter than the full (live performance) VHS tape releases. The quality of the video is acceptable, however, and is well worth getting if you don't already own the VHS tapes of the TV specials ... (just can't understand why the publisher didn't put the full versions in the collection ... probably cheaper this way ...)"
5,War of the Worlds book review,"I loved this book, I am fasinated by aliens, even thought they might not be real!! I own the first movie of War of the Worlds and haven't seen the Tom Crusie one yet but I hope to soon! Anyway, this book puts you into the feeling of what it would be like to be in an alien invasion for Mars. I loved and I know you will too!!!"
4,Surprisingly Disturbing,"""War of the Worlds"", the grand-daddy of all alien invasion novels - and easily the most famous - has endured for many reasons, among which is its ability to reflect the anxieties present in successive ages since it was written. Currently, and not surprisingly perhaps, it carries a very post-9/11 feel. This is a story of gradually mounting terror and the panic that ensues, triggered by an incident whose momentous import is unappreciated initially. The world changes and the previous age's complacency can never be retrieved.Wells's ability to capture a believable human response to an unbelievable occurence is what keeps the story grounded and genuinely frightening. This edition, illustrated by one of the great masters of the mischieviously macabre, is one to savour in these unsettling times."
5,The War of the Worlds,I downloaded this story on my phone. I have not read it yet but will soon. It was easy to do.
5,Classic sci-fi at its best,"This was a great book. I've seen the old movie and heard the radio version, but the book is much better. Anyone who claims that it is a bad book because it is 'boring' or because it takes place in England is a fool. The book was written 50 years before we even thought of exploring outer space. Now that's good..."
3,Hard Read,"Because of the time frame this book was written in, of was a very hard read. It was rewarding though"
2,Sensationalist drivel for the masses,"This book was boring and depressing at the same time. A shallow plot that is supposed to bring fear but fails completely. This book might have been good when it first came out decades ago, but it fails to grab attention now. As a plus, it probably broke new ground in science fiction literature at the time, but this matters very little to me personally. I read this book as it was part of the Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection from Easton Press, and I did not want to throw down $40-$50 on a title I did not enjoy or value thoroughly. Instead, for this genre, I recommend Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"", ""Dune"", by Frank Herbert, ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", by Heinlein, or ""Flowers for Algernon"", by Daniel Keyes."
2,Boring,"I had to read this book over the summer for school. Since I love fantasy, I chose books that were fantasy or science fiction. I adored The Hobbit which was fantasy, but found The War of the Worlds to be too much science fiction for me. Even though it was a short book, I found myself constantly counting how many pages I had left to read. It was extremely boring. Normally I find reading fun and invigorating, but reading this book was like a chore. It had a good plot, but had too many events leading up to the climax and too many leading to the resolution."
4,Great book,"It was a very good book of its time,and is still and will always be amazing.I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Not what you think from watching the movies...,"This is not quite what I had thought it would be, based on both the two movies and Orson Well's infamous Hallowe'en broadcast. Nonetheless, it was worth the read for the book itself."
3,war of the worlds H.C. Wells,Found that it was very imagative. It was very creative. But it didn't have much excitment. I found it boring.
5,It rocks,I read this book for school and with it being a classic I didn't think it would be too good. Boy was I wrong. It turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read. I highly reccomend it to anyone who loves science fiction books.
2,"Great Series, Not-so-great segment","This audiobook by Winifred Phillips left me disappointed. My enthusiasm for ""The Masque of the Read Death"" left me hoping for far more of ""War of the Worlds"". I'd recommend purchasing the musical version of ""War of the Worlds"" instead."
2,The World Full of Wars,This book is a mix of science fiction and drama.The author also plays the role of the main character.The action starts in the second chapter when a large cylinder falls from outer space.An astronomer who is also the narrator happens to be in the right place at the right time.He watches the first cylinder fall and while he is inspecting it he discovers some sort of life.At this time the action begins.He's basically stuck roaming to and fro trying to dodge the mysterious aliens.This story is very suspensful and at times difficult to follow.However I did enjoy reading it.
1,I read 10 pgs. into the book and thought it was BORING!,I had high expectations for this book but found it horribly boring as did many other people I gave the book to . None of us were able to finish it for fear of falling a sleep.
1,Dull and boring. Don't waste your time!,"This book may be a classic, but it is a chore to read. Very little happens in the way of action or character development. The plot is well known thanks to the famous radio broadcast and movie adaptation. You'd think the book would give you some insight as to the characters or a more involved plot line. Well it doesn't. This book may be one of the first ever Science Fiction novels written, but first does not equal best. Especially in this case. Do yourself a favor and read something a little more current. If you are looking for a good Science Fiction classic, check out ""Dune"" or ""John Carter of Mars""."
2,so-so,"This book is very nicely written, but it just didn't catch me. I usually an read a book in 2-3 days, but this one didn't really get my attention, and it took me 5 days(Actually I was halfway through, and I gave up on it)to read it. I might have been reading a different version of it, but I'm pretty sure it was this book, because on this website I 'looked inside this book,' and it started out the same way. I personally think this book isn't as good as I thought it would be."
4,Great sci fi for a book written over a hundred years ago!,First thing I have to say is what great scientific imagination for a book written in the late 1800's. I mean they didnt even have cars yet and Mr. Wells is writing about partical beams and biological warfare. 2nd is I was actually surprised at how much the recent movie used from the book. I didnt care for the movie as much as I did the original version but it was much more faithful to the book than I'd ever imagined. If you your a fan of either of the two movies or just want a very good sci fi book to read I highly recommend this book. The language at times is dated being written at the turn of the century but it's still a quick and easy read.
4,The World is OVER!,"Mankind's big question is answered in this extradornary story written by a spectacular author. Ogilvy the protagonist of the story is the brains to help stop the horrendous incident the world is feeling. Aleins!.......quick run!, the thought of that just rushes the adrenaline to someone. An extra-terrestrial spaceship crash lands on earth, Ogilvy saw the crash and was shocked about what he witnessed when the hatch of the spaceship opened. What came out of there was not human....... The author really knew how to catch someone's ""heart"" from not flying away. Other then that the book is a very good book. Really interesting points if you like science fiction. But then again he could of made it sound more realistic with the explosions and action going around the story."
4,A great sci fi classic.,"I just finished this book. before i read it I thought it was dumb to suppose there is life on mars. but then, as i read on, the story gripped my attention like few others. I love how as you read on, you learn more about the martians. However, Wells gave names to almost none of the characters. mot even the person telling the story, but it is still greatly written."
1,Yawn,"Interminable. Perhaps in his day, Wells' writing would have seemed interesting, but today...All that happens in the book is the narrator scurrying from town to town without direction or purpose. He hardly even describes anything or anyone, so it's impossible to connect with any of the characters. And what he says of the Martians, which arguably are the only interesting things in this book, is fleeting and vague.No character development, no plot, no real conflict, no motivations. Damned waste of time, really."
4,It's no wonder Wells is considered to be the father of science fiction,"""...I honestly picked this up thinking that it based on its publication date, it would be stale and maybe somewhat laughable, because of how far science and technology have come since then. The 1950s film adaptation was in mind at first, along with other corny sci-fi flicks of that time. But this book is far from stale or laughable. Wells paints a very realistic picture of a world in the midst of utter destruction as the narrator determinedly makes his way across the countryside towards London - with the current mega-popularity of the post-apocalyptic setting for novels and film today, War of the Worlds would fit right in if written in the present. This, coupled with the glimpses into humanity Wells gives, make this book surprisingly poignant in more modern times, regardless of the technological advances we've taken.""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!"
5,Great Book! Wells rules.,I have read this book twice and I love it. The story is just fantastic. I wish someone would make a movie following the way the book was actually written 100 years ago...
3,Martian Invasion,"I am an eighteen-year-old senior at Walla Walla High School. I read The War of the Worlds in my English class this year. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the book. There was not a lot of character development, which made it hard for me to get into. The ending also left a lot to be desired for me. Overall, I would say the book was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Rutland gaskets and glue,The glue 3 o/o 4 times will not be usable!The rope is excellent. I had to purchasemany sizes as Harmon stoves does not see fit toinclude this info in their manuals. ???
4,It is great for serious seekers.,"I purchased this book four yrs ago. Re-read it and decided to purchase it as gifts for my prayerpartners. Not for a ""novice""!"
2,Review John Adams,Product was advertised with jacket covers for each book. See Picture. Books came without jacket covers. They appeared to be old library books with there library designation painted on the outside of book.
2,I'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND THAT'S BETTER THAN THAT!,"O! my. So many allusions and so little point. And despite its surface sheen and highly affected, postmod technical slips this film will undoubtedly be found as but a paragraph in the still early chapters of the 1,000 Volume Edition of ""Style: Its Grinding Victories Against Substance"". Go with ""The Third Man"" instead..."
3,Offbeat thriller experiment is worth a look,"The story in ""The Good German"" is a little dry and long, but if you have any predisposition to enjoy a layered tale of wartime intrigue, you'll make it through okay. The real selling point, though, is the wonderful production design and gorgeous black & white photography, the latter seen in generous widescreen glory (after the opening credits, which tease you into thinking you'll be forced to watch the movie in the boxy aspect ratio of actual 1940's movies). Ultimately, what's, well... good about ""The Good German"" is that it doesn't settle for being a well-produced pastiche of old wartime movies, but says a few compelling things about the ways otherwise decent people are willing to behave in situations when they feel their backs are against the wall. Problematic in some ways, ""The Good German"" is absolutely recommended at least as a rental. The DVD looks and sounds great, though there are no extra features."
1,This Is Ridiculous,"Seriously. Listen to ""Someday"" and ""How You Remind Me"" at exactly the same time. They are almost the EXACT same song!! Try it for yourself, I urge you."
1,Save your money,"One of the most poorly written books I've ever read. Dispite the serious subject matter, I found myself laughing aloud at the tortured prose, stilted dialogue and ridiculous non sequiturs -- not to mention the many grammatical errors. This lady needs an editor!"
4,Attractive Jar,"This jar is very attractive and looks good with the other counter-top Villa della Luna accessories (utensil crock, spoon rest, etc.). The jar's detractions are that it is not huge and doesn't have a lid that seals out air. I'd give it a ""B."""
5,My Fav,This my favorite Will Rogers yarn. It pits little guys and 'right' against the big guys and legal. Even though 'right' might be on the wrong side of legal.
2,Does she even DO yoga?,"The video wasn't a complete waste of time, but if you're a person that does yoga at studios or more professional videos then you will not like this DVD.The instructor doesn't even do the poses, and when she does she looks like she can't even get in them all the way. I would think that if you've practiced for so many years that you would be at least somewhat more flexable.... At least so we can see what the pose is supposed to look like.It does not flow well through quite a few poses. You'll be in one position and then she'll have you move to another that doesn't flow with the first.She skips a side of your body half way through warrior poses - I'm shocked that no one has mentioned this in other reviews.She chants at the end....what is that?"
1,Least Favorite Fertility Aid,"I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years. I started with classes, which I now take maybe one per year, and currently work with tapes. Most of these poses were beyond beginner (such as 'Threading the Needle', which can be dangerous for people with previous neck injuries) and didn't offer much in the way of attainable modifications.The production is amateurish at best and the yoga model looking into the camera is greatly distracting. The models were obviously people from her classes and not professional instructors as you can see them struggle with the poses as well as breathing.I recommend that you will better spend your money on 'Yoga 4 Fertility' with Brenda Strong. Her voice is soothing and her instruction is very thorough.Best of Luck!Krista J. Essler, LAc"
2,Not that great,"I think this album's pretty weak. Most of the songs start out great but then don't go anywhere. They just end.. Like ""Once upon a time, there was a mean knight and a good knight. The mean was mean and the good was good, oh yeah...THE END"" After listening to it four five times the music got pretty bland and boring. I gave it a second listen after seeing all these marvelous reviews but it didn't get any better. If you like hearing bridgeless music that doesn't really mean anything buy this album. I don't think I get it yet."
4,better that good,"I was after only one song, but became impressed with the whole album this group did have it all in this period of music."
3,70's rock,"This was a ground breaker, yes it was. Would it be today? This album was the pablem Future rockers drank...it was 70's background music. One step removed from Gary Glitter...(along with Queen) who as we all now probably collects royalties from every baseball and football stadium in the country. It was heavy, it rocked and it was probably released around Christmas to help boost sales."
5,The album cover says it all.,"T Rex's 'Electric Warrior' is one of those rare albums (The Beatles' 'Sgnt Pepper' and Pink Floyd's 'Darkside of the Moon' come to mind) that really stand the test of time. It is unbelieveable how this album still sounds 'fresh' and 'innovative' now as it did over 30 years ago!The album contains great mix of songs from 'hard rock' (Jeepster, Rip Off, etc...) to 'ballad' (Girl, Life's a Gas, etc...). I honestly think that Marc Bolan is the most underrated song writer (and guitarist) ever! Give it a listen and you'll see why."
5,Timeless Classic,Marc Bolan and T. Rex are timeless. The music is a good today as it was when it was created forty plus years ago. It is a very sad tragedy when an artist as talented as Marc Bolan has his life cut short.
5,Great R-N-R! Incredible lyrics!,"Yeah, I'm not sure that the lyrics of BANG A GONG mean anything literally, but you know as well as I that they convey the essence of lust better than any others. Set those lyrics to an incredible and original groove, and voila!-a CLASSIC! The whole album is great, but BANG A GONG alone is worth the price of admission-one of the greatest R-N-R songs of all time. Marc Bolan was a true original. Plus, the album cover is one of the all time best at conveying the spirit of R-N-R: a guy, a guitar, and a stack o' amps!."
2,save your money,"Tony Visconti failed at recording of this excellent music, and now he failed at remastering again..."
5,Satisfied Customer,"Been using the Superior Pump 93501 1/2-Horsepower Cast Iron Sewage Pump with Tethered Float Switch for a little over a month now & it has been working great, no problems at all. The $120.00 with free shipping, price was great too considering we couldn't find any new sewage pumps that were 1/2 horsepower for less than $200.00."
5,bilingual n esl classrooms,"I was very pleased to receive my book in time. The book was in great conditions, actually new. Thank you very much. It was my pleasure to do business with you."
5,Wonderful product!,I was looking for a natural product for coughs and all my research led me to Enzymatic Therapy. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough. Soothes the bronchial passage and soothes coughs! I highly recommend you try this product. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.
3,Works for poking fires,Works for poking fires BUT the end is always coming lose so moving logs in a fire pit can be a challenge. I think I will try some JB weld and see if that will hold it in place. I will not be able to remove it but why would I need the end off anyway?
2,Poker,"Not the quality I need or I suppose expected. Although I suppose if I lower the expectation, this would be OK to push wood around in an outdoor fire pit."
4,Kt,This is my favorite cookie sheet to use! I loved the first one so much that I ordered another. Cookies always come out evenly baked.
5,Worth Every Penny,"I heard about this from Cooks Illustrated, and it is worth every penny. I have had it for a few months, and it still looks brand new. No warping, even heat and browning, and easy to keep clean. A great gift for any baker."
1,"Misrepresented on Manufacturer's site as English subtitled - please be warned, there are NO subtitles","This is a review forDona PerfectaThe manufacturer of the DVD claims that the DVD has English subtitles (please refer to link below)[...]Based on good reviews I read on the internet, I purchased a used copy of this (the same UPC as posted in the mfr site) It does NOT have English subtitles as claimed on the manufacturer's website. Video quality is that of public domain. Disappointed but subtitles could have redeemed the experience of subpar video. Please be warned"
2,Disney needs to get over themselves.,"Anneliese Van Der Pol is my favorite disney singer, and Lalaine is great. They should be all over this CD. But no, these people at Disney decide to use the same singers who NEED a comeback, like Christy Carlson Romano. Or, even better, actors that want to be triple threats, such as Hilary Duff and Raven Symone. Raven, your a great actress, stick with that! And Haylie Duff, she's just riding the coattails of her baby sister. Disney, please, use singers that WE, the generation you are reaching for, actually LIKE!"
2,Hmmmm....,"Ok, so it was ok. Lindsay Lohan was so-so, and This is My Time was good too. Otherwise, please don't waste your money!! Download Limewire or Bearshare, they're free, and download any song you like!!!"
3,NOT leak proof,"I purchased this and tested to see if it really was leak proof, it is not. I filled with water and shook upside down and it leaked, then I dried it filled it again and turned on it's side and after a few minutes it leaked. if you keep it upright and just use it to pour out the spout when needed it won't leak but put upright when done."
2,"love the jug,hate the leak","I bought this size jug so that I could drink directly out of it.No matter how tight I got the lid,it leaked.So if you drink anything but water get prepared for shirt stains.This could be fixed with a rubber seal/gasket.So why don't they??"
1,Disappointed,The charts were advertised in English but they are in Chinese. Impossible to read. Of no use at all.
5,A Great look at Movie History,"It was a great book and although this movie is a bit different from the original book, the movie gives us a great look at the view of the future in the 1960's. Obviously H. G. Well could not imagine a nuclear holocaust to destroy what we know of civilization, but it is a better explanation then what the book gives us and is easier to relate to. H. G. Wells was trying to show us the downfall of civilization through industrialization, and the movie shows us the modern problem of the 1960's."
2,campy,"Part of the problem with TTM, is that it was made in an era where technological restraints made it impossible to duplicate Wells story. Still, the deviation from the book, makes the movie hard to take. It's ""Lost in translation""."
2,Worth it for a laugh,"Like any old campy sci fi movie its good for a laugh just to see crappy sets and terrible Morlocks. I dont think anybody takes this movie serious, well i hope not anyways. The same people who like this movie are the same ones who say the remake is terrible."
4,Above average entertainment,"I saw this movie on tv when I was a child. It made a big impression on me. I saw it again as an adult and realized it had even more to offer in the way of concepts (above and beyond the special effects). I know this movie was remade. I saw the remake, I can't remember very much about it, it was unremarkable.But this version was intriguing, and thought provoking and has cool special effects. I shared it with my grandson for the first time. He's 10 years old and jaded by Modern Warefare II type graphics, but he still appreciated this movie. It has special effects, it has a story, and it sticks in your mind. What else could you ask for?"
5,Travel in Time with HG Wells,"Several 3rd grade classes in my school viewed this movie (rated G)after reading a version of the book. We'd read it chapter by chapter and reviewed with EOG-style questions. Wow-talk about a page-turner! The children could not wait to read the next chapter just as soon as we finished the last. Watching the movie was a fun way to see the images we'd created in our minds come to life. This was the original version (I think the best) and because it is rated G, I felt very comfortable showing it to my students."
4,The 4th Dimension,"A man makes a time machine and travels forward in time to see man's progress. He goes so far forward in time, that the land is unfamiliar to him. A good scifi adventure!"
4,The best of science fiction,This was one of my favorite movies growing up at the Saturday matinees. The other one being Mysterious Island. I had problems with the sound and the actors not being in sync with what they were saying. Maybe it was just my computer but it was a problem.
5,Veronica Mars Season 3,"Another brilliant season of Veronica Mars! Sadly the last one as I have been made aware of recently :(Veronica and her friends are now in College at Hearst, however you don't see much of Wallis, but she has made new friends now and occasionally catches up with Wallis.The only thing that was not so great was (without giving anything away!) the open ending, I felt that the ending really didn't resolve much and it feels like another couple episodes should have been added to the season.Previews are included on this disc for what they thought would be the 4th season, which looks interesting but seems to have lost the 'spark' the original three seasons had, so maybe it's not such a bad thing there are only the three seasons after all.The outtakes are fairly funny, and it's good to see the cast and crew having fun :)"
1,not so thrilled...,I bought this series on 8-22 for my girlfriend. We both have rather busy lives and she doesn't get a chance to watch a whole lot of tv. I also bought the second season for her as well. (no problem with that one)... By the time she got around to watching the series the 30 day return policy had expired. The dvds did not play properly and I have no way of returning then for an exchange. Just wanted to make a note to anyone interested. Need to see if they play properly before the return time runs out. Now I'm stuck with a series that's no good :/ ...
1,Emperor's New Clothes,"Never have I seen a show rest so completely on its past laurels. Was the first season of Veroinca Mars fine and compelling television? Yes, it was. The same cannot be said for the later years, with this final season being the most creatively bankrupt and oddly self-impressed. Veronica Mars as a show and as a character are unrecognizable here. Even putting the misogynistic, homophobic and nonsensical storylines aside, Veronica Mars still manages to commit the cardinal sin of all entertainment: it is boring. What a sad end to a promising series."
4,Great show too bad it ended,The 3rd season gave a new twist to the other seasons.My only regret is that they didnt do 4th season Veronica in the FBI would have rocked.
4,V. MARS #3rd season,"the 1st and 2nd season were EXCELLENT.the 3rd season is VERY GOOD, I'm just sorry there are no more"
5,Do it your self,"This book is a must have for any homeowner and if you have rental houses as I do it is essential. Have had this book since, or its predecessor, since 1966 and lost in a move. The price through amazon was fantastic and so bought it once again. Nicely updated."
1,Don't bother.,Way too outdated. Basically useless if you are considering traveling to India. I am surprised anyone is still carrying this book on their shelves.
3,Same as Hannibal...,"Man, talk about a killer running around after a bunch of people that can't put 2 and 2 together, let a lone, girls with big breasts running around trying to escape. The movie basically takes us back just like the ""Hannibal"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" did, showing us how the villain, sort of, transpired, sort to speak.Lots of surprises, blood and gore, just like the first movie."
4,The Best Massacre,"I have seen most, if not all, of the versions and sequels fo the TCM. This is the best by far. This is one of the best slasher/horror flicks I have ever seen. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. It actually deserves a 4.5 rating. I would recommend this fo any horror fan. I fear this movies' success was cursed with the same curse as Halloween H2O, Jason X and Aliens 4; great movies all, but by the time they were released most poeple were tired of the franchise. This just isn't the best of the TCM franchise; this is one of the best horror/slasher flicks ever. I know this movie is supposed to be based on a true story,but being a romantic, it would've been nice if the girl had survived at the end. I hope this is not the last in this franchise, especially if these same writers can perform this same magic with another script."
2,"well, it has gore...","mildly amusing and zero percent thought provoking or original. Lots of sub par gore that is cashing in of a franchise instead of really adding anything new for true horror fans. Hot chicks and chainsaws...yeah, i get it. If your a fan of new horror this has high production value and is right up your ally. If your old school this is a been there, seen that film."
2,"Nice, but . . .","As there is no American release of this film, which is mind-boggling, I had no choice to order the Canadian blu. While the picture and sound are very well done, and super sharp, that is ALL there is to this disc. No trailer, no featurettes, no deleted scenes. The American dvd has all of these and a few more tidbits to gnaw on, but Allied's bare-bones offering is movie-only. If you love the film, get it, but don't toss or trade the dvd just yet. Maybe Warner/New Line will give us a good blu in the future, but the optimal chance for a good release came and went with the premier of Texas Chainsaw. Sure, Warner didn't make it, but with a Chainsaw in the theater, a blu would have ""made a killing"" so to speak."
4,Great horror flick,"It's gorrific! Explains the remake of the original down to the last detail, unlike some movies where they leave most of the characters' sadisitc traits to the imagination. Good film, fun to watch. I didn't care for the original round of Texas Chainsaw films, so I'm glad they remade them. Few remakes are better and more entertaining than the originals, and these two films actually are."
2,GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie really sucked i thought it was going to show his life from the start it showed him born then did this little slide show thing threw his younger ages then all of a sudden he is like 18. i think they should of made the movie longer and showed some more of his childhood. also the movie wasnt really scary and it was far from exciting. but i gave it 2 stars because the acting wasnt bad at all, and the killed somebody it was in a sick and cool way, and the deaths did look very realistic. if you are going to buy this to complete a collction thats why i did. but if you are looking for soemthing as good as the 2003 remake this isnt it."
5,A True Gem,"This is a true treasure of a book. For an intermediate student, it answers many question that you ask yourself, but are never answered in text books.The author didnt learn spanish as a hard core academic, he learned it the real way. He went through the same struggles you go through, and is able to help from that point of view.I've bought many books on spanish during my self led quest to learn the language; some very good, some bad, but none compare to this one.I just wish the auther would consider writing a second and even third book and expand his unique insights into a series."
2,I don't like it,"I thought this was a good book, but it was not good for me. There was no introduction, and most of the instructions in the book were in English, so i wasn't helpful to me trying to learn Spanish."
2,Not as good as their first,"I really liked their freshmen release, A HILLBILLY TRIBUTE TO AC/DC a lot. AC/DC+bluegrass: Two crappy genres that manage, somehow, to sound just ducky when melded into one. But Mountain Love lacks the twisted, psychobilly focus of that effort. It's merely AOR+bluegrass.The only songs that work to any campy degree at all on Mountain Love are CENTERFOLD, CAT SCRATCH FEVER and FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE; the latter of which sounds, at best, like it was a SOGGY BOTTOM BOYS outtake. I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL and BIG BOTTOM are just plum embarassing; the latter being a travesty of a parody of a sham of a travesty... FAT BOTTOM GIRLS doesn't belong here, at all.My advice to Hayseed Dixie: Next time make another hillbilly-hardrock tribute. There are tons o' worthy/lousy candidates for the pickin': KISS, Metallica, Black Sabbath &/or Led Zeppellin come readilly to hand. Stick to a proven formula: metal+bluegrass"
1,Disappointed,"As a CD designed for English speakers who want to learn Dutch, Learn Dutch Now 10.0 failed miserably. The content must not have been reviewed by a native English speaker, because some examples are given only in French or German, and many examples that are given in English are incorrect! Obvious errors and poorly designed learning structures abound. Of course some useful content is contained, but not content that one can rely upon if your reason for learning Dutch is for more than entertainment. This is my third language and my fiance's sixth, and neither of us found it useful enough to be worth the money or the time we invested in studying. We now have to invest in another program and spend many more hours studying from the beginning. We're not pleased at all."
5,Great Lingerie Cage,This is a great lingerie cage! It washes all my bras without ruining them in the washer. Yay! Saves time for me so I am very happy with this product!
4,Works great.,"Good price, easy instructions, & does what it's supposed to do. Great way to breathe life into an old HD for added storage."
4,A brilliant introduction to Virginia Woolf,"Virginia Woolf is often a difficult author for students to become familiar with. Her _Orlando_, which strikingly defies placement in a single genre, introduces the reader to Miss Woolf's language, her symbols, and the themes common to her many equisite works. However, _Orlando_ is bereft of the beautiful and detailed stories and ideas which enrich her other works, making the novel on the whole a simple enough read for the beginner.Compared with the span of her works, _Orlando_ stands out as an original among originals. Nowhere else does Miss Woolf so successfully tell a fabulous tale, and nowhere else does she render concrete locations, times, and events so beautifully."
4,Great book,anyone who truly loves baseball will enjoy this book. it is very easy to read and is great for long trips or a rainy day in winter when you are yearning for the grand ole' game.
3,Entertaining Beach Read,"I don't think the author intended for this to be more than an entertaining read. I doubt that she intended to be politically incorrect by referring to the heroine as a ""blimp"". By Hollywood standards, a size 14 is pretty unforgivable, but in real life it's pretty much average--throw in a few curves and its downright sexy. Pretty Woman is meant to be entertaining and it is."
5,Friends can be more like family,"Pretty Woman is a wonderful story of how a person should not take friendship for granted. Rosie Bliss is a woman who is ""blinded"" for the love of a man who is not in love with her but her money. Even after her best friend and her maid try to warn her. She thinks they are jealous because she has found a man who she thinks loves her full-figured body. It will take Rosie almost three years to find out that they were right. It is then she starts to take control of her life by throwing out her husband, losing the weight she gained during her marriage and finding true love. Readers will love the relationship Rosie has with her maid, Luna Mae."
2,My first and LAST Fern Michaels,First of all I could not get over how a size 14 is so obese and disgusting. Give me a break! I also didn't like her style of writing. It was very juvenile and seemed like the book was written over a weekend. It's one of the worst books I have ever read!
4,SCREAMING LOUD,"Sorry, bought it locally. Maybe I should have tried exchanging it, it is screaming loud.Is it supposed to be screaming loud? This is my first belt sander. It works great so far, after a few days of use. Installing the belt was easy, and it tracks right. I intend to use it as a stationary belt sander. Maybe the fact that it is upside down is the problem :DWhat I mean by ""screaming loud"" is that it is loud enough to almost require earplugs."
3,Not a beginners book,"Unless you have a good working experience of pattern-making, this book probably isn't where you want to begin. The author has assumed a level of expertise that is beyond a very beginner. The ideas are inspiring and it does have some fun ideas, especially in re-building the shape of furniture. But if you need to start from Square-1 then keep looking for a book that will teach you more of the basics. If, however, you are an accomplished seamstress, it won't be difficult for you to have a lot of fun with this book. You can fill in the blanks with some upholstery Q&A websites on-line."
1,Not worth the money,"Very disappointed. Little assembly instructions, cup holder will not fit, if it is collapsable I haven't figured that out yet. Very little ventilation for pet, should be great for winter. Maybe by then I can figure out how to collapse it to fit in the car."
4,It's cool,"It is.. what it is. As a Sublime fan, I look for anything I can get my hands on. But what can you expect from various bands singing Sublime songs? It ain't Sublime!Definitely some cool takes on the songs... and a couple not-so-great. The Santeria cover is horrible. But that's my opinion... I've listened to this once and while I don't hate it, I would rather listen to Sublime."
3,WHY?,"I agree with some of the already stated opinions. Why would you put avail on this album. I wish they would have put more ska bands on there. I also appreciate the fact that they had all kinds of different genres covering these songs, but how in the world would you overlook putting a band like pepper or slightly stoopid on there. I've heard rumors of another tribute album coming out from other fans who are dissappointed, and i will look forward to the release of this upcoming album. I gave ""look at all the love we found"" three stars, basically because it had something to do with sublime, not to mention Jack Johnson and the ziggens had good tracks."
3,Only 5 ft tall...not what I expected for floor lamp,"My fault, no where did it list height of lamp, but it is only 5 ft tall and I expected 6+ feet, I like the way it looks but is too short for my living room where I had planned to use it...Please list accurate dimensions, please!!!"
4,A different approach,"This book offers a different way to evaluate stocks. Although the book size is average, the time needed to read and understand the book is two-fold. Your entire attention must be available and a two week period must be set aside in order to justify the cost of the book.Overall, it is a very good book for new and seasoned traders. It is also a good book for those who are concidering the transistion from investor to trader. I concider it one of the best books in my financial library.If you concider buying this book, insure you have a new highlighter and pencil at your side. A lot of information is provided and much of it is repeated to insure you understand. But highlighting some information can offer better review for examples."
3,Not a do it yourself strategy,"I found the investment strategy proposed in this book made a lot of sense. However, I doubt Tom's strategy would be very useful for short term traders. This is because you may have to wait months before making a decision to buy or sell. I was also really disappointed that his investment strategy requires you to chart every single stock on the New York stock exchange on a daily basis. Individual investors don't have the time to do this if they have a daytime job. Thus, the book is really a subtle promotion for his company which is an investment advisory firm using his strategy or for a company called Chartcraft which provides this kind of charting for a monthly fee. Finally, the book is dated. It is 5 years old and downplays the importance of NASDAQ stocks."
1,Dow's Theory Rightly Attributed to Charles Dow,"""indeed, Dow Theory, while credited to Charles Dow, was actually first put together by S.A. Nelson in the book The ABCs of Stock Speculation.""This reviewer's comment above is a bit misleading. The Dow Theory, as explicated in chapter's IV thru XX of Nelson's book, are actually abridged editorials written by Charles Dow (that orignally appeared between Dec 14, 1900 and July 31, 1902). Nelson in his book accurately attributes Dow Theory to Charles Dow, who was editor of the Wall St. Journal at the time.Nelson's contribution to Dow Theory was the act of compiling Dow's editorials; William Hamilton (Stock Market Barometer, 1922) and Robert Rhea (The Dow Theory, 1932) were so impressed by Dow's ideas about how markets work that they were keenly interested in documenting his ideas in print, as well as extending those ideas."
1,Very disappointing collection from Rhino,"Im surprised Rhino would put out anything but a complete collection spanning all of her labels......country stars are notorious for jumping from one label to another, which makes it hard to get all the hits in one place. This CD covers her later, WB years, with ""Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue"" thrown in for gravy. Nothing from her Columbia years, or her first big hits from United Artists. The majors labels could make a collection this bad, so why should Rhino sully their sterling reputation for quality with this garbage? I dont know, but I hope it isn't a sign of things to come......"
1,Dissapointed,"I bought this book hoping to find inspiration and instructions on how to create a lampshade, but now I'm returnitg it. There is no instructions what so ever and most of the designs I found to be not useful if you want to decorate your house simple but tastefull. I was very dissapointed!"
3,Good rails/bad hardware,"Rail are great, they're made out of a softer wood which makes me question the ""dent-ability"" long term. My real issue was the hardware that was shipped with the rails. The assembly bolts are least a 1/4"" too short. After I realized this I just repurposed the bolts that held the sides on from the crib. Other than that, a full sized boxspring and mattress went right on to the frame without problems."
2,Useless...,"The NOW series is a cute compilation with the latest chart-topping hits. The songs are mostly bubblegum pop with a bit of radio-friendly rock thrown in for good measure. But what's the point? You hear each song almost every day on the radio...who needs more Britney Spears anyways. With music-downloading software like Kazaa and Morpheus, you could easily get this pop drivel for free. I don't see any point in showcasing songs that will be forgotten by the time the next NOW comes out.Get it if you want to keep on top of the music industry."
3,Good Cd but still missing something,The only thing bad about this CD is that it is somewhat false advertising. Notice that it says 20-chart topping hits..... well if this is true where is linkin park? puddle of mudd? the calling? they are all in the top 10 on the billboard 100 yet i have yet to see one of there songs on a NOW! CD. Dont get me wrong the songs on the cd are good but not the best out there.
4,NOW No 9,"...NOW 9 is a good compilation (B+) with many good songs and others really bad...like all the NOW serie.BEST Songs: ""Stuck In A Moment"" (U2): Excellent!!! 100% classical U2 rock, a great tune, I remember the Joshua Tree (10/10).If you like this song then buy the last U2 album ""All That You Can't Live Behind"" with lots of great tunes...2nd:""Dig In"" (Lenny Kravitz): A great rock song. Lenny is totally a rock star.(8/10)WORST songs:""Drowning"" (Backstreet Boys): A really BAD song from a boy group. So boring! No rocks! Only filler(0/10)2nd: ""Gone"" (*N-Sync): Another boy band...This song is terrible but not as bad as BSB (1/10)"
3,It's ok for the price,"This little set is ok for the price. My daughter had a blast wearing it, but after one time wearing it the hair is all matted and when I try to brush it, the hair starts to fall out. There is not a lot of hair to begin with - it is kind of thin, but she still likes wearing it even though it's all tangled. It stretches and fits well."
1,Waited too long,"I also ordered this wig back on August 10th. My date was moved several times and I even was promised by Amazon that I would receive this wig sometime the week of October 8th. Customer Service even made up a story about how they had one reserved for me from some ""vendor"" somwhere. Needless to say I got an email from Amazon the very next day saying I would get the wig in November and I never got the wig. I got the run-around every time I called. I found the wig at a store locally and bought a bunch of ""Hannah"" accessories. I paid much more money, but I am now guaranteed my daughter can be ""Hannah Montana"" for Halloween."
3,You may not receive this item in time,"I cannot review the actual product, but you might want to know that many people have had problems actually getting this wig shipped to them. I am still waiting. If you are looking to have it by Halloween, you may want to look elsewhere. Edited: I have canceled my order because it will now not be available until the END of NOVEMBER. That's too late for any of us wanting to purchase it for Halloween."
4,very happy!,Very good quality for the price. We have 3 hannah montana wigs for our daughter's halloween costume. This is the best we have found.
5,A fun and sassy read.,I bought You Slay Me on whim last year. I had just finished Corset Diaries and decided to give it a try. Not only was You Slay me a fun ride but Fire Me Up is better than the first. Miss Macalister takes you on fast and fun ride into the world of dragons. I myself can't wait for the third book. If your a person who enjoys the paranormal you can't go wrong with the Aisling Grey series.
1,I refuse to buy any more of her books,"I can stand a cliff hanger, I can't stand a blatant attempt to steal my money. This book is an example. Drake is the best thing that ever happened to the heorine (she's so annoying I can't even remember her name)I wish a demon, or the dog would just eat her so the book would end. Don't buy this crapfest!!!!"
3,A Good Read,"MacAlister is an excellent author covering a unique subjet(dragons, etc.) extremely well. This is a good read. Purchase it. This book will hold you over till the next Aisling Grey comes out.(buy her other books) Though, simply put it is not as fantastic as You Slay Me(really her best work to date)."
4,Just like the first book,"I have only read the first 100 pages of the book, and it has grabbed me instantly. If you read the first book in this series, (if you want to call it a series, this book could be a stand alone) it picks up from where it left off, and is just as fun to read. the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star because it's almost like re-run so far of the first book. But like I mentioned I only read the first 100 pages. Very entertaining, I can't wait to get back to it."
2,I Expected SOOOOO Much More!,"The first book, ""You Slay Me"", has some really interesting takes on the supernatural with its totally messed up main character. However, after I read the first book I wondered if the main character was strong and independent, hated Drake, or just hated men in general. The next book, ""Fire Me Up"", especially the ending, answered the question. It is pathetic. It is almost as if the author is going through an ""I hate men"" spell.I hope that Katie writes another book in this Guardian series and finally has Al ""grow up"". Drake's character deserves better. ;) Yes, I know that she feels that he betrayed her, however, it is in his character to make her think. She should have spelled out to him more of what she wanted prior to accepting to be his eternal mate. ...and then to threaten him with another dragon. Shame on you Al! Al is a selfish, whiney, brat who needs to have the tables turned on her."
2,OK book but seems hurried,"I used this book when working on the TOEIC. The good part was that it doescomprehensively cover the test; the bad part is that it seems like it was writtenin one week. Not very much depth, simplistic explanations, just a little superficial overall. I think there are better TOEIC books out there."
1,hums...but no whistle,"I bought this teapot as a Christmas gift. I received it the beginning of Dec., shipped it to my mother in New York to be opened on christmas morning. My mother loved it but said it only ""hummed"" and didn't whistle but it was okay because she could still hear it from the next room. Within a week, it stopped humming, and of course, never whistled. It was inexpensive...so I guess you get what you pay for. Very disappointed."
3,Typing method flawed,"I can't say this to people enough; that MBTI method typing is flawed, because of the following reasons. First, the test you take on typelogic dot com determines you internal self. Myself for example-internally I am ESTJ but in reality I am INFJ (ESTJ is my dual-the person who is the best match for my personality type). Second, as you can see from my example of testing ESTJ my internal dual-seeking self is menefesting outwardly flawing the resaults of the test thereby putting you in a pool of people you wouldn't get along with. For correct resaults-type yourself using How to Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics by Rod Novichkov then take the MBTI test and you'll know exactly what I'm taling about."
4,"Love the music, but...","We love listening to this CD, but we were a little disappointed when we found out that the written lyrics were NOT included. In my opinion, that's a huge part of the educational value of buying a product like this one. The good thing is that I find my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son trying to sing along anyway and we've only had it for a few days. So we will keep listening because it is fun & upbeat with a wide range of musical genres."
2,Wide Bra Extender too Wide.,beware: the wide bra extender is very wide. measure your current bra before buying!
2,Disappointed,"I really needed a whistling teapot because I get busy and forget it is on. Well, I was very disappointed when it didn't whistle. It is very pretty and looks nice."
2,DON'T DO IT!,"Everyone else isn't wrong-it just doesn't whistle.I thought mine would be different, but even after 5 different adjustments, there is no whistle. It's the only tea kettle available in this plum color,which I really want, but it isn't a whistling tea kettle."
3,Right color red kettle,"Does not whistle. Have placed a pot watcher inside, because that is the only way one would know the kettle has come to a full boil. Have owned it, and lightly used it for a few days. The real test will be this winter, when we drink much more tea."
2,no whistle,"A letter to myself two weeks ago. Ahem.Dear Kate, why do you insist on disbelieving other reviewers who say the whistler on this kettle doesn't work? When your birthday present to yourself arrives, you're going to be really annoyed for not listening to the helpful people who TOLD you.No whistle. Lots of steam. Argh."
2,whistle stop working in 3 months,"I later figure out why the whistle stop working. The plastic surround it can't handle the heat, so the shape changed and whistle can't work the way it supposed to."
2,"""Whistle"" doesn't work","Looks pretty, but do not expect it to whistle. It whistled the first time I used it - a humming tone, like a distant emergency siren. Hasn't worked since. I think the thin metal reeds are good for one use only and become too weakened at their flex points to stay properly ""tuned"". I followed previous reviewer's (""researchingmom"") instructions for fixing the whistle, and it whistles when I blow it strongly, but it won't whistle under steam power."
3,A Piece of History,"""The Final Concert"" is for folk music fans something like ""Intolerance"" is for movie fans: an essential historical artifact, but not really an entertainment. It is unedited as far as I can tell, and no ""production values"" have been added. The songs are familiar. The reason to listen to this album is just to Be There... to be part of the audience at the Hungry i as the Trio -- relegated to pop history by the British invasion and the rise of heavily-amplified ""folk rock"" -- played its last live set. (We are well aware that one of the original Trio members, Dave Guard, was not in attendance.) I still have my vinyl version of the Trio's first album, and I wanted to complete the circle. If you're like me, this album is an essential part of the collection. If you just want to enjoy the music, albums like ""Live from the Hungry i"" are what you'll more likely want."
3,Decent retelling of a great battle,"This book, in my subjective view, is inferior to Walter Lord's excellent Incredible Victory which recounted the same battle. It lacks pace and descriptions of battle scenes are tame compared to Lord's version. What it lacks in narrative, this book compensates by giving detailed information on the fleets involved in this mortal struggle and providing intelligent retrospective factual analysis on the various decisive factors which led to an American victory and a heavy Japanese defeat. Overall a reasonable read, but for a more gripping and tense pulse pounding read, i would recommend Incredible Victory."
4,A Great Book about the Turning Point Against Japan,"For a guy who has been dead a while, the author keeps turning out some good books. At Dawn We Slept and Miracle at Midway are two of them. Midway was the battle that turned the tide against Japan. Midway is a Battle so exciting that fiction could never top it, and yet this was history. And this book captures the battle brilliantly. Walter Lord also did a great job in Incredible Victory. This battle showed the determination of American sailors and airman, the leadership of Nimitz, the importance of aircraft carriers,some luck and intelliegence. I enjoyed this book very much."
2,Poor Performance!,"I registered for this monitor thinking it would be a great idea. No cords to plug in, so if I wanted to walk around with the monitor, I could hear it, and I could even have it in my pocket and feel it vibrate. But, it never worked right. I would have to fiddle with the volume to keep it from constantly fuzzing. The vibration was cool too, but that broke after about 6 months or so. I guess I just thought we would get what we paid for, but it doesn't always work like that. I know I won't buy another Fisher Price product again =("
5,Pfaltzgraff Villa della Luna Covered Butter Dish,Very nice colors and larger size than some butter dishes. I bought it to go with my mystic dish set to add some color
3,"Eh, alright I guess","Great but didn't come new or sealed as it says. Cd case scratched, doesn't seem like the real thing. Cd itself wasn't scratched."
2,False Advertising!!,"The product itself is great. Folds easy and weights very little. We bought this for our twins to go along with Chicco keyfit 30 seats. Even though the box clearly states that this stroller is made for those seats, it really is not. You can make it work but not very easily!!"
1,"KeyFit 30s - No Snaps, No Gos","KeyFit 30s don't fit on this stroller. That's too bad because the stroller seems great otherwise, and the KeyFits are wonderful. There's a YouTube video from 2009 showing them fit the stroller. But they don't fit for me in 2011 with all new purchases.Each car seat fits individually. But when I try them at the same time, one of them is pushed out of place. If the seat doesn't sit securely, the little webbing strap is being asked to do more than it was designed for.FYI, the Snap in Snap N Go is for when the stroller frame is extended. It clicks (snaps) when the bar locks in place. There's no snapping in of KeyFits at all. They just rest on cross bars, and little webbing straps are supposed to hold car seats and babies on the stroller. Yikes!Next stop: Chicco Together."
1,Horrible Customer Service and Broken Stroller,"PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.My wife and I purchased this stroller from Amazon.com within the last three months. It pulls to the left when you are pushing it. Not a horrible thing, but still defective. What is horrible is the customer service that we have received from Baby Trend. First don't even try calling them, because every time you call you will be put on hold for 10 minutes and then told by a recorded message that they are experiencing higher then normal call volume and you're hung up on. Second, if after three days of trying like we did and you get through, they'll basically tell you sorry nothing we can do. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH."
1,Does not work with Chicco KeyFit Car Seats,This stroller does not function as advertised with Chicco Key Fit car seats. The seats do not snap into the stroller they just rest on the frame. There are two straps that are suppose to secure the seats to the stroller however they are barely long enough to fit over the car seat and still allow it to slide around. The stroller may work great with other car seats however it is simply unsafe to be used with the Chicco seats.
5,Great Book for a Great Price!,"I'm currently enrolled in an Undergraduate Course in Relational Database Systems. I was getting tired of reading incomplete tutorials around the internet on how to use JDBC and MySQL effectively so I bought this book bought last week on Amazon Marketplace. It was ridiculously cheap (About $3), but after seeing how useful it is, I definitely would've paid the regular price. One of the authors, Mark Matthews, actually wrote the Connector/J driver for MySql!-This book is a tutorial, NOT a reference.-All of the code and examples used in the book are available online so you don't need to waste hours retyping code to get the feel of it.-The book assumes you are somewhat competent in Java and goes into applets, beans, and EJBs, but I think someone who knows C++ and really understands OOP will be able to manage alright.Good luck!"
1,Crap,"I was excited to get this blu ray as I love concerts in blu ray. I watched/listened to 3 songs and was actually embarrassed. Embarrassed that I bought it and they should be for putting this crap out. I could barely make out a word he was screaming in his off key out of tune ""voice"". I will just remember them the way they were and melt this plastic in my fire pit.I will add that the Amazon reviews of the Creed blu ray originally led me to Airborne Toxic Event so I bought that blu ray also. I had never heard of them before and my one word review of that blue ray is: Brilliant."
2,What Happened?,"What happended to the audio mix? Stapps vocals are far to load and his voice is well below par. The soundtrack is edited so much that the audience may as well not be there apart from a token shout here and there. There just seems to be no body, no soul, it's just flat. Great albums but this DVD does not do their them justice. Great Shame."
3,Pretty Good Concert.,This is a pretty good concert. The vocals are off a little. What happened to the concert that was recorded at The Palace Of Alburn Hills in Michigan. That was a great show back before they broke up but was never released.
2,"Tired, dull & self indulgent","Its hard to imagine why the Alter Bridge boys have decided to retrack old ground with Stapp. For the most part his lyrics are lifeless and his stage presence is self indulgent, tired and performance completely forgetable. Whilst the remainder of the band continue to impress, Stapp should hang up the microphone and concentrate on other endeavours."
2,Just watch it for the compatition,I did not buy this Dvd just to watch a bunch of girls run around topless. I just bought it to watch the compatition. Because I'am that type of person who will watch any compatition. Like who can get to the rings the fastest. Hope you all understand on what I'am saying here
3,steamfast multi steamer,"I like this product. What I don't like is the cord it's not long enough and the handle keeps falling down when I mop. I tried it on my oven, and I would still use a oven cleaner instead of this product. As for the floors it does a good job.I haven't tried it on clothes for the fabric steamer. I mainly bought this for the floors."
4,21st Century Housekeeping,"Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks? Just because we've been slinging mops and hauling buckets of scalding water for years doesn't mean we liked it. So I was intrigued when this newfangled gizmo called a ""steam mop"" appeared on the infomercials and shelves with the cleaning appliances at the stores. Anything that would make me hate mopping less I had to give a try. And I must admit, it ain't half bad! After reading reviews for similar products and their vendors, the SteamFast had the best reviews and Amamzon has always provided superior service. This device is far less time consuming and backbreaking than the old mop and pail method, not to mention far more sanitary. The power cord could be two feet longer (I subtracted one star for that), but otherwise, I would recommend the SteamFast SF-290 in a heartbeat."
5,clear and easy to follow,"as a primary introduction book for statistics in geography, it is clear and easy to follow. Very useful for geography students"
3,Yawn. Lots of repitition.,"I am a Kevin Mitnick fan. However, I had to book this book down halfway though. I felt that it kept repeating itself. This would be a good book for non technical management to understand the kind of things that happen. If your an IT professional or a security professional you will be bored out of your mind reading this book."
1,He's just a grifter,"There's no technical knowledge here. Just a con artist conning you out of a few more bucks. Yeah, he's smart, yeah, he's clever. But he's not a hacker. Do your self a favor -- put some Scott Joplin on the stereo, and wait for this to be remaindered."
3,Art of deception.... by boring your reader,"Since my first book on hackers (Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage by Clifford Stoll) and reading about Mitnick in the early 90s, I was expecting a fantastic book outlining how he managed to do so much while on the run.Unortunately, the writing style is quite repetitive and boring. Don't get me wrong - the substance is there, and there is plenty to be learned from Mitnick's 'fictional stories' that illustrate the concept of social engineering. However, as I said, the style leaves a lot to be desired, and after reading the firsy half of the book, I struggled motivating myself to grab the book and finish reading it.I recommend it only if you do not understand how social engineering works and don't mind putting up with a professional social engineering with amateur writing skills."
4,So interesting,"Mitnick writes a very interesting book.Sometimes a bit melodramatic, but an instant classic of a security title."
2,Common sense,"I just finished Kevin Mitnick's Art of Deception. I started the book after I saw 3rd episode of The Broken and a friend told me he has just bought a copy while visiting London.I expected an eye opening and high-tech hacker book, but I was very disappointed. In his book Mitnick lists plenty of social engineering stories, couple of which do represent a fresh way to look at things, but after reading couple of them, he just starts to repeat himself. Another disappointment was that there are absolutely no practical hacker hints or tricks and almost no computer related stuff in this book. After every story Mitnick gives advice, but that is typically just common sense and I have doubts how his methods of keeping a company safe of social engineers could be practical in a professional world.So, if you don't have any other idea what to read on the beach this summer, you can grab a copy. But if you are into computers and over 14, you'll probably struggle to read the book to the end"
4,I am really enjoying this MP3 player!!!!,"This is a perfect MP3 player for working out. It doesn't hurt the back of my ears some other headphones do, and it is light and easy to figure out. The only improvement I would like to see is a bigger storage capacity. All in all I am very satified with my purchase!"
3,"Haunted,The [VHS]","Produced by Nicholas P. Nizich, Michael A. DeGaetano.The Haunted is a 1979 Horror film directed by Michael A. DeGaetano, starring Aldo Ray, Virginia Mayo, Ann Michelle and written by Michael A. DeGaetano.I have viewed some pretty bad films and this is definitely one of them. This is one of those movies one should only watch if they are like me and just have to check out every film in the genre despite the warnings of other Horror film heads. It's about a ghost town where the past is coming back to oppress the small community. An indigenous American woman was burnt for witchcraft and comes back for retaliation. Also Known As: Haunted (USA) (video title), The Glass Cage. Company: Northgate Communications."
1,Shorter than a children's book and nothing new,I read this leaflet in less than 20 minutes. It didn't tell me anything new either.
1,A Thin Booklet,"I expected to get an actual book; this is a thinnish booklet of the type found on wire turn-arounds in health food stores. So I was disappointed; however, my sister says its a good summary of current knowledge on the subject and she's very informed in this area."
3,"Nice wide gate, but limited uses","I bought this gate because the doorways and staircases in question were 47"" wide. I thought I could buy one gate and transport it as needed. I didn't really want gates all over the house... The problem is that the gate is clumsy to use. The latch is supposed to stay on the size you designate, but if you pick it up to move it chances are it will bounce around and you will end up resetting it most of the time.In addition, This gate doesn't seem to be sturdy enough to keep my 7 month old son from knocking it down. The first thing he did was climb it, but of course the thin plastic grid hurt his toes and he didn't know how to get down. He spent the rest of the short time I used it wrapping his mouth around the grid before he knocked it over. I going to return it."
2,Misleading description....,"The description makes it appear that you will receive 54 different colored pencils. What you actually receieve is 9 sets of 6 colored pencils all the same. It is definitely a misleading description and had I known, I would not have purchased it!"
4,One great book,This really is a complete book. It contains an index of recipes by ingredient and by type as well as clear instructions for thousands of drinks. .
1,Wheres my shotgun?,"I didn't buy this album but I know how terrible it is because I've heard almost every single track on the radio. I hate pop (though not as much as I hate rap) and if you actually consider the words okay, good, awesome or anything related to those words to describe this album then you are smoking something like crack, pot or crystal meth. This is terrible, just the words pop and especially trl make me stay as far away from this piece of crap as possible. Whoever came up with the idea of making a 'Best of Trl pop' anyway? All it is is useless overplayed songs with little meaning and no inspiration (good inspiration). Its albums like this though that make me glad that N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys and O-Town are here no more.*Note: Amazon needs to get 0 and negative star options.*"
1,A very useful CD.,"Really! This CD makes a great coaster. Every time I set my drink on it, my wood furniture stays dry and ring-free. This CD can also be used as a frisbee. Go ahead, take your pooch outside and use this CD to play frisbee with it! I guarantee you and your canine friend will have fun for hours and hours. But whatever you do, do NOT put this in your CD player and hit the play button. (Unless you're looking for an easy way to get a headache.)Yes, this is typical, wretched, pre-fabricated, sickeningly sweet pre-teen pap. But what do you expect with a title like ""MTV: The Best Of TRL Pop""? Alice In Chains? Led Zeppelin? The stuff on here isn't even Blink 182. I probably shouldn't have to tell you this, but leave this one to collect dust on the record store shelf.That was too easy."
5,This book seemed to pull me in! It wasgreat!,"This book will make you want to read it all the time! It was a **** ( Fourstars) movie, but of course, The book has more gory details. On the flap of the book,( borrowed it from the library) It says this is King's love letter to his fans. He's right! Misery will scare you to death"
5,Couldn't put it down!,"What a book! I couldn't put it down from the time I started reading it. I couldn't wait to see what the psychopath, Annie Wilkes, was going to do next. Was she going to catch Paul leaving his room when she wasn't home? What would she do if she did figure it out? Was anyone going to discover Paul Sheldon was missing and being held hostage by this psychopath? How did Paul find his sense of humor given how he was living - in constant pain (not to mention fear), and having to bring a character back to life that he had come to hate? What was going to happen next?"
5,King classic,"A must read. Wonderfully written book. Colorful story. King's earlier works, in my opinion, are some of his best. Misery is one of his greats."
5,CREEPY BUT NOT GORY!,"I remember reading this book 8 years ago in a staff house rumored to be haunted. Of course, that only contributed more to a wilder imagination! Like all other SK novels, Misery carries an element of supernatural. I couldn't consider the story as horror since there were no ghosts,apparitions nor exorcism --- but still paranormal in the sense that Annie Wilkes was acting abnormally. She was sort of a lunatic too obsessed with ""Misery"" & its writer. I also admire SK for being able to capture the readers' attention considering that the story was too tight-spaced ---- limited to 2 characters trapped in one house, with nothing to do but talk, write & axe each other :-)"
5,One of King's better books,"This is a disturbing book- disturbing in a good way, if you like suspense and tormented characters. Paul is a writer who crashes his car in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of nowhere, and has the misfortune of being ""rescued"" by a psychotically devoted fan (Annie) who imprisons him in her house. It's pretty amusing to see what King has to say about Paul, and I got the impression that King was poking a little fun at writers, but the reader will have to judge for herself. The plot is simple- sort of an extended siege in Annie's house- which turns out to be pretty exciting in the end. Annie has something coming, and the reader will have to see if she gets it! Overall, a very entertaining read, and I'm glad King didn't drag it out to 700+ pages like some of his other books. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
5,Subtly terrifying,"This is not a typical piece of horror fiction. There are no ghosts or goblins or even rabid St. Bernards to scare you. What I find so terrifying in Misery is how perfectly ordinary the villain Annie actually is. Or at least appears to be. She has her flashes of insanity, but you never really imagine how dangerous she can be until it's too late. A well written and instantly engrossing book."
3,Descriptive,"Like a number of other Stephen King books that I have read, there is an abundance of descriptive writing that conjures up mental images that really make you believe that you are a fly on the wall of the story. The plot of this book is good and the images conjured up are at times gruesome and I could really feel Paul's desperation at not being able to escape or even know if anyone was looking for him. Despite this, however, this book just didn't do it for me. The Annie/Paul parts of the book were good, but the book within the book 'Misery's Return' was just boring - I skipped whole chunks of this to get back to the 'real' book. Overall I would recommend it to a friend if they asked me what I thought of it but I would not sing its praises. I am currently reading 'Rose Madder' and so far it is very good."
3,Movie Was Better....,"I just hate Stephen King's writing... I mean his stories are great and they make wonderful films, but I cannot stand reading his work. It's just... ugh... drives me crazy with its simplicity."
2,The movie is better than the book.,"I was interested in reading this book after I saw the movie. The book is in my opinion, very disagreeable. I had a hard time understanding how the hero of the book gave that evil woman chances. One moment he's saying how you can't reason with crazy and the next moment he's sorry for her and not wanting to hurt her feelings. He had an opportunity to get away or die trying, and did not take it. I couldn't buy his reason for not leaving and then she came back and hurt him super bad. There are none of those brain teasing games in the movie; the woman is nuts and he tries everything to get away from her. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
4,Misery,Great book. Gritty Stephen King at his best. This edition has the occasional and very annoying typo. But in all still a great read.
3,misery,misery is very boring in some parts. it is also very exciting in some parts. i really like stephen king's work it's just that this was very dull even though you can't put the book down.
1,Misery didn't really interest me,"I read books a lot and when I read this book It was really boring. Usually books that I read pull me in. I call this book an ""unfinished book"". I read this book because it was for a report for school(New Utrecht High School-Mr. Nelson)"
1,Sheer MISERY to read!,"Read this book if you are stuck on a submarine and you have read everything else already. I saw the movie, thinking that it might be better (but, of course, movies are never better than books). Boy, was I wrong! The book was bad, and the movie was worse. King does not develop characters well in general, and he does a particularly poor job in ""Misery"". In any good book, I will find myself anticipating a knowledge of the characters' fate. Not so in ""Misery"". Within 100 pages, I had no feelings for either of the main characters. I considered it *work* to finish this book. Believe me, if you can get through this, you can get through anything."
3,Decent,This DVD will give you a very general idea of what Portland looks like and even a little history of Portland and the Columbia River Gorge. The problem is that some of the footage seems to be very old stock footage and the narration and musice are so corny as to be laughable.
2,soap opera style movie,"Well, I was expecting a bit more entertainment. Instead, the action proceeds much like a soap opera and never reaches any suspenseful or frightening climaxes. Example, young girl being used as ""bait"" for vampire waits nervously unaware that the vampire is advancing upon her from behind. The camera pans down so you can see the advance of the vampire from under the couch the girl is resting on. What should be a terrifying, suspenseful scene is undermined by the view of blue slippers and the bottom of a dark blue cloak on the ""creature"" (an attractive but blah, middle aged mom) walking up on her. Ridiculous, and not even funny! On the positive side, it is a nicely shot movie, has good sets, good costumes, and there is one good fencing scene. So, two stars. Other than that, pretty uneventful. Not worth a second viewing."
2,Kronos: Hammer's Dying Attempt At Medival Vampire Films,"TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good;It has a cool poster, and some good scenes.The Bad:Kronos is well, less than brillant. It is one of hammer's attept's to change vampire films. Among the others are Vampire Circus, a really weird Hammer vam[pire film from 1972, Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, the kung-fu vampire movie, Satanic Rites of Dracula, the satanic cult vampire film, the Vampire Lovers, the super-violent hammer film, Countess Dracula, the historical vampire fim, and Dracula A.D. 1972, the groovy/mod, mod vampire film. Another reveiw said that it got an R, because it was in a double feature with Frankenstein And the Monster from Hell, but that film isn't actually that bad. Ii would give it four stars!From: The hammer Film Reveiwer"
1,Woeful,"I unfortunately bought a dud. A diehard vampire fan will watch just about anything in that genre and while I realised this was from a particular genre (not necessarily being vampire), I was very very disappointed with the whole thing. Not much point picking it to peices cause it is just my opinion but a stronger, more realistic (to the role) and appealing (not necessarily typically attractive) and just interesting leading man would have helped immensely. I was not thrilled, chilled, suspense filled or eventually even interested in continuing watching it cause it was just boring and a bit ridiculous. I didn't like it."
4,ONE OF HAMMER'S BETTER VAMPIRE FILMS,"One of Hammer's better Vampire films, this one presents some interesting turns on the lore. These vampires can appear in the day time, and as they feed they become younger. One of the more chilling effects in the picture occurs when the head of the family of vampires walks through a forest in the daytime, blooming flowers instantly die as she passes.The film has a very good musical score, beautifully done sets and good cinematography (As do most of the Hammer Films). The cast is perfect, and includes the stunningly beautiful Caroline Munro. I've met her a few times at autograph shows, and found her to be an extraordinarily nice person who adores her fans every bit as much as they do her.The DVD is nicely packaged, with good sound and clear, sharp picture. This is a must for any Hammer Fan!"
4,A good value,"I have been using this tub for sushi approximately 2x/ week, and it is working well. The copper hoop has been tacked down with with brads, so no problem with falling off. I have soaked the tub for about 30 min prior to use and at this time have not noticed any warping. I am not sure what type of wood was used, but it does absorb moisture well from the hot sushi rice. The size is perfect for home use - very suitable for the four portions of rice I usually make.When I first received the tub I noticed what appeared to be smears of glue on the inside of the tub, but these washed off easily after I soaked the tub for the first time.I haven't found another tub on the internet for such a good price, and the product is very serviceable. All in all I am quite happy with it and would recommend it to someone who loves sushi but doesn't want to spend too much for the equipment."
3,fine progressive keyboardist from sweden,"If you like keyboard wizards, try this one. Swedish prog musicians are respected since the seventies, and this guy made an interesting multi- keyboard, symphonic record in 1980. worth listening."
5,The Mystery of God's Word,"This was a gift to my husband, a catholic permanent deacon, who said it was excellent and thanked me for getting it."
4,Great!!,"This product is great. I bought it for my significant other who's favorite animal is the duck-billed platypus, and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
3,Handle gets hot,"The kettle heats water quickly, has a nice whistle, holds a lot of water but the handle is too hot to use without a hot pad."
4,Informative and fun!,"If you want to learn more about German football/soccer, its history and stories, read this book. Hesse-Lichtenberger is a fantastic writer and enthusiastic fan of the sport (and not necessarily the way it is played by the Germans), who puts all his love and knowledge into this book. You will learn about the ""Schalker Kreisel"" which made one of Germany's club teams (FC Schalke 04) one of the best and most advanced teams in the world when German soccer didn't have a wimming reputation. You will learn about some of the scnadals of German soccer and about some of the forgotten stars. Hesse-Lichtenberger takes the subject seriously, but finds a light and humorous voice that makes this book entertaining and enjoyable.One of the best soccer books I have read, although readers should have some interest in learning about German soccer. Otherwise this book may be too specialized."
3,"""Not sure if I'll survive myself....""","Not sure how original this is (so many obscure goth bands) but it is definitely an interesting listen.On first listen, most of the songs sound the same, but eventually you will notice the differences. The BEST songs on 'Consign to Oblivion' are ""Mother of Light,"" ""Solitary Ground,"" and ""Hunab Ku."" Excellent pieces, these three. ""Quietus"" and ""Dance of Fate"" are also very good.Not so good are the songs ""Force of the Shore"" and ""Consign"" (which was quite disappointing, as it's the title track).My complaints:The lead singer's voice can become operatic and ""thick"" when she sings the high notes, sounds bad.Also, the whole ""death growling"" thing does not fit AT ALL, sounds terrible. And the choir has some parts that are more like chanting than singing, it just sounds silly.Overall, it's still a good album with some great tracks."
3,"Nice, accurate watch, but . . .","Great styling and mechanically sound watch. However, the minute counter on the chronograph function (9 o'clock sub dial) is difficult to use; there are only a count of seven minute markers between each ten minute block. For example, between the ""10"" and the ""20"" of the minute counter, there are only seven dots to mark the current minute. At five-minute intervals, it isn't so difficult, but at minute counts of three or seventeen minutes, for example, it's hard to say if four minutes have passed, or eighteen minutes have passed, respectively. Overall I like the watch for telling time, but the chronograph function has critical limits that should be considered before making a purchase."
3,"Descent hot sauce, not for those who like a lot of heat.","I agree with the above reviewer that this sauce can be bland. I have to admit, I tried the sauce because of the neat looking bottle. It definitely adds some flavor, but those who are used to a more robust and flavorful hot sauce will probably be disappointed with this."
2,"They may have liked it, but I didn't at all","It has always amazed me at the amount of money I spend foolishly. I read reviews and I purchase expensive books (like this one) and can't wait until it is delivered to my door so I can gain a better perspective on a specific subject. If that's your goal too, then you're wasting your time and money just like me.Business rules are important (that's why I bought this book) but I didn't learn a thing that I already knew. Actually, I could probrably write a better one than this and I'm just a lowly DW architect.I'm not going to get into the facts, the other reviewers didn't either. Just take my advice and look elsewhere."
4,Smaller than I thought it would be.,Smaller than I thought it would be and took a long time to arrive. It was to be a birthday gift and it arrived long after the date that I expected it.
4,Good Rack,A good all around rack. Built well and very functional. Only problem is customer service at Hollywood. Called with a few questions and the person was impatient and a bit condescending. Too bad- kind of bittered me towards future Hollywood products.
3,Allright,"I like George winston's music, however, listening to two of his CDs in a row was a little bit much for me. I had listened to ""December"" prior to listening to this CD."
5,Winter into Spring.,The music quality is great. This was given as as gift and the receiver has already listened to it and and is happy with the enhancement.
1,do not buy this item,"this item is not at all what it is cracked up to be. i bought this item in my 5th month and tried to use it and i could not hear a thing, so i thought well maybe i am using it too early...i waited and decided to try again later. i am now in my 9th month and still cannot hear anything. the only sound you are able to hear is your stomach digesting food and if the baby moves you can hear it hit the walls of your uterus. well who wants to hear the baby move. you can feel that. please take my advice....do not do not do not spend your money on this product....it doesnt work. thank you"
1,Save your money!,"I am now 33 weeks pregnant and have never been able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this device. My husband and I have both read the directions thoroughly and neither of us has had any luck. We try it all the time, so it cannot be that the baby is in a bad position. The only thing we can hear is my own stomach growling. I agree with the other reviews to just buy a cheap stethoscope."
1,Horrible waste of money,"I purchased this in hopes of hearing my little one. I am well into my third trimester and so far all I can hear on it is the noises from every part of the house. The instructions indicated I would be able to hear movements and hiccups as well as the heartbeat. The baby has kicked the monitor and it hasn't sounded, but if I move my finger at all on the button I hear that. I hope no one else wastes their money on this."
1,waste of money!,"If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. My husband and I purchased this, thinking we would be able to hear the baby's heartbeat. We tried as early as 3 months, and only heard the usual gurgling and swooshing noises. Even at 8 months, we still couldn't find the heartbeat, but we could hear a plane flying overhead! Total waste of money!!! Use a stethescope, it works alot better!"
2,Disappointing!,"We bought this item in spite of the mixed reviews it had gotten, so in retrospect, this is one item we could have done without! We've used the CDs and microphone to read stories to our little one, but have had absolutely NO luck hearing the fetal heartbeat. I think half an hour is the longest time we spent in search of a sound other than my gurgling digestive tract.You're better off going to your regular prenatal visits and relying on the midwife/dr to hear the heartbeat. You can also ask if you can attach a mini cassette recorder into the doppler to record the heartbeat."
4,I cant Believe so many bad reiviews,"I bought this product when I was PG with my first child 2 years ago and loved it. It did take a few times to hear the heartbeat, but once I figured out how it worked, it was more easy to find in future uses. I found that I was turning the valume to high and once I fixed that mistake all the background noise went doun. I recomend u put in on the middle valume setting. I loned it to a friend and she says she cant here the heartbeat, so I dont understand why some can and some cant. I am PG again and will be bying another since my friend boke my old one. I would recomend this product, but dont waste youre money on the deluxe model, just for incase u are one of thouse who cant figure it out."
1,Total waste of money,"I finally found the heartbeat after about a month of trying, and it is EXTREMELY faint. A stethoscope would do better. For $49 at the store, I am extremely disappointed. Spend the extra money and get a doppler."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"My husband bought this because he wanted our almost 3 year old daughter to be able to listen to the new baby's heart beat. I am nearly 6 months along now and we have not been able to hear a thing! All we hear is gurgling sounds, popping and static. I also find that even my breathing causes interfearance and I end up holding my breath while we try to listen. This item is worthless and a HUGE waste of money."
1,USELESS,"SINCE I WAS EIGHT WEEKS ALONG, MY OB HAS ALWAYS COMMENTED ON HOW LOUD AND STRONG MY LITTLE ONE'S HEARTBEAT IS. HERE I AM, AT 24 FULL WEEKS, AND STILL CAN'T HEAR A THING EXCEPT STATIC AND GURGLING. NOT FOR A LACK OF TRYING EITHER, I'VE SAT AND LAID IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS, TRIED 200 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, AND EVEN TRIED A BRAND NEW BATTERY...NOTHING HAS WORKED. I WISH I HAD JUST PUT THAT MONEY TOWARDS A GOOD PEDICURE!"
1,Not worth it,My husband and I have yet to hear our baby's heartbeat with this device. Save your money!
1,Not worth it,"Save your money for other things you will need once the baby has arrived! Until then wait until your next appointment with your doctor and you will be able to hear the heartbeat at the Doctor's office. Don't worry yourself silly trying to find the baby's heartbeat with this. like I did...I was however able to play music for the baby in utero, which is why it did receive 1 star. Something that I could have accomplished however with my husbands portable cd player."
3,Good product for the price,"I purchased the Bebe Sounds Prenatal Listener, not the Deluxe set. I didn't think speaking to your baby through a microphone would be any different from just speaking regularly through my wife's stomach. So I decided to go for the cheaper deal, not expecting much, I mean you pay anywhere from $22 to $45 for this product, what do people expect? The Dopplers that Doctors use can run a few hundred dollars, they are meant for medical use! You can't expect to get the same results from a $22 dollar product. I must say that for the price it serves it's purpose. Sometimes it takes a while to find the heartbeat but as long as the room is quiet I have no problems. My only real disappointment is that it features a way of recording the heartbeat onto your computer or tape recorder but the sound never comes out as clear as when you're listening through the headphones."
1,EXTREMELY disappointed,"The monitor has been sitting on my nightstand for some time as I had never been able to hear much aside from outside noises (television, washing machine, neighbors talking, etc.) or static from my own movement (breathing, an unsteady finger, growling stomach, you name it). I am now 38 weeks and decided to give it another try today. I heard a very faint heartbeat. I thought I could FINALLY record something via computer as suggested by the product to send a file to baby's grandparents in California. Even worse than hearing the static through the headphones is hearing the TREMENDOUS static and background noise after replaying the .wav on the computer. It even overshadowed the heartbeat which was inaudible on the playback. I am so extremely disappointed that I am considering writing a letter to Bebe Sounds about this bogus product. Please heed the warnings and save yourself the frustration of buying this ""monitor."""
3,To bother or not to bother?,"I am 5 1/2 months pregnant w/ our first. We have not yet been able to hear the baby's heartbeat NOT for lack of trying, and I don't expect this to work; that was a bummer. My Dr. also confirmed that these things don't work. A pregnant co-worker of mine had success, but she is SUPER skinny! However, we can hear her move and kick, so that is kind of fun. I did like the microphone that it came with (although you have to use your own stereo) and I did like the little speakers to play classical music for the baby (although again you have to use your own tape or CD player). Overall I would not recommend this product, just use a walkman to play music for the baby."
1,Never heard the heartbeat,"This doppler device is a complete waste of money. Even at 8.5 months, we were never able to hear the heartbeat. Everything just sounds like static. We ended up borrowing an old-school doppler and always found the heartbeat right away.Do not buy this - it is a waste of money. You are better off renting a doppler from the hospital!"
1,Terrible Waste of Money,"If there was any way I could give this product NO stars I would. I am 35 weeks pregnant and have YET to hear anything other than noise from this gadget. In fact, those women who hear the baby ""moving"" and such, I challenge you to put the monitor on your husband's stomach...you will hear the exact same noises. All it is is YOUR OWN regular digestive sounds you are hearing.It's clumsy, frustrating and doesn't do what it promises. I was lured by being able to ""hear the baby's heartbeat"" and I feel like I was taken for a ride. It's not right to play on people's emotions and then provide them with a product that doesn't work.I am very dissappointed in this product and I hope I save you the frustration I felt in this product.Bottom line: save your money for something else."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this product despite my girlfriend telling me that she was unable to hear her baby's heartbeat with the Bebe Sounds even up to a few days before delivery. My husband and I have tried and tried, and then tried again to hear the heartbeat and it's just not going to happen with this monitor. We were excited to hear ""swooshing"" sounds, thinking this was the baby, but when I put the monitor up to say, my ARM or LEG, you get the SAME SOUNDS!!!! I'm very, very disappointed."
1,Huge disappointment!!!,"I am so very disappointed in this product. With my first pregnancy, I was not able to hear a heartbeat until my seventh month. I am on my second pregnancy and am 25 weeks along. So far, I have not heard a damn thing but the cars outside my apartment building, the tv in the living room and even the neighbor's stereo downstairs below me. I was very close to trashing it during my first pregnancy, but this time, I chunked that damn thing in the trash! Do not waste your money on this product. If it's priced below 100 bucks, then it's probably a piece of junk. Just go off of your baby's movement every day for re-assurance that all is well."
3,Hard to hear - but it does work . . .,"If anything, this device is nice for what it plays back to the baby. It's been hard to hear the baby's heart beat, but I did hear it. What I've heard most is the baby kicking or punching me - I know that's what I hear because I feel it too! My favorite thing to do is hook up the speakers to my belly with music and then put the monitor up to my tummy and listen to what the baby is hearing inside! THAT is pretty cool! If anything, it's nice to play music to the baby - which it really seems to like - and read stories. The first time my husband felt the baby kick was when I had the music hooked up and the baby was kicking during certain parts of the song. It was really worth the money then! The stethescope part isn't all that great, but the speakers and the microphone are wonderful."
1,heard everything EXCEPT baby,"I borrowed this product from a friend who told me it didn't work. I was slim and 22 weeks pregnant, so I thought I should be able to hear something. Turns out the microphone is so sensitive, all other noises beat out any noise from baby! I heard my finger joints move, the air conditioner turn on, and since you have to hold the button down the entire time, any hand movement is detected and hurts your ears! Perhaps if I waited until 30+ weeks, I might have had better luck, but as an anxious Mommy, this product didn't deliver."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this device when I was approximately 3 months along. I had no idea that it would not be of any use until around 4 or 5 months. This in itself lead to some disappointment when I brought it home. I have since (now 6 months pregnant) tried it 10 or so times all with no luck. I have not heard a single thing even coming close to a heartbeat and my child is very very active so I know it is there!! I would not recommend this product to anyone especially if you get let down very easily.
2,An old plot,While it's true that it goes downhill after the beginning. The movie goes away from the basketball player Jackie Stewart and focuses more on the coach. The coach is so desperate to protect Jakcie that his own family sufferes with his wife getting raped and his son holding the bloody remains of the family dog.I would probably say that this movie sounds more like something that would be a Law & Order plot.
1,weak attempt to discredit Bucaille,"the book is a sorry attempt to disprove Maurice Bucaille's book the Bible, the Quran, & Science. other people that agree with Dr Campell ( who claim to have read Bucaille's book) seem to overlook a great detail about Bucaille. He was not a muslim when he set out to write his book. he specifically learned arabic to study the Quran. The facts given in his book are thorough & percise. Dr campell's attempt to disprove him is cleary just an angry response which has blinded him for being truly objective. His examples are weak & sorry. I urge people to read Bucaille's book & see for themselves. Anyone who supports Dr Campell & thinks Muslims are trying to attack the christian faith are mistaken. People should not forget that muslims beleive in Jesus & his miracles. If your looking to buy a book that compares the Quran & the Bible ,i suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Disappointed,"I decided to read this book as an attempt to understand what a non-muslim thought about scientific evidence in the Qur'an. What I assumed to be a debate, turned out to be a slander of the Qur'an.Even though I was quite offended by the remarks, I was very pleased when Dr. Zakir Naik debated Dr. William Campbell, who is the author of ""The Qur'an and the Bible in the Light of History & Science"", Dr. Zakir Naik not only defeated William Campbell, but managed to embarrass him. On a humorous note, Dr. Naik challenged Dr. Campbell to prove himself a true Christian by just reading the phrase 'one hundred rupees' in the seventeen languages of India as is depicted on a hundred rupee note of India - in this context, Dr. Naik referred to the claim of the Bible that true Christians can speak in new foreign languages.***If you are interested in learning about this epic debate between the Muslim Zakir Naik and the Christian William Campbell, visit this site: (url)"
5,A great niche piece of equipment,"This unit works as advertised, quiet, efficient and easily installed. Arrived very well packaged that made it sure to get here undamaged."
2,Bad move,This unit is awful. I have a TINY studio apartment and it is never cool enough. Now it started shutting down sometimes and won't restart. This is my second summer with it. Very loud also.
3,"Still the ""old"" classics","As other reviewers have noted, if you're new to Amy Grant, this is a perfect CD. Most of my favourite pieces from her early years are here.On the other hand, if you are a die hard Amy fan and have all her earlier CD's, definitely skip this one. There is nothing new here. I mistakenly thought she had re-recorded her old hits in her new, more mature voice, but it's just cuts from her old CD's. I didn't need one more ""old"" Amy Grant CD; my shelf is full of them.So, a great compilation of old hits for those getting acquainted with the young Amy (which I recommend!), but old hat if you caught on 20 years ago."
2,A little bit too technical for an intro,"After reading the reviews on this page, I was excited to read a book that would provide a ""layman"" like myself an easy introduction to the workings and ways of the brain. But I was disappointed with what I read. The first two chapters were great, and truly were introductory and easy to read: the first was a basic introduction to the brain, and the second provided reviewed the history of brain research through the ages. Starting with Chapter 3, however, the book became overally technical and difficult to read. The Chapter on memory was interesting, and overall I did learn things, but as a ""layman"", I found myself very confused and overwhelmed as I struggled to make it through what I found to be a very 'Non-Introductory' introduction."
4,Describes the brain concisely with clarity,"Another Very Short Introduction published by Oxford, The Brain describes in more than enough detail to satisfy any college course the functions, mechanisms and probable evolutionary development of the brain. It does not go into molecular descriptions, but stops at statements like ""potassium ion gate."" Also, the text identifies want isn't known; such as the purpose of the glial cells that surround neurons.The text is straightforward and clear; although the topic is nearly overwhelming. The first major item that surprised me was that the neurons of the brain are basically the same for all species. Humans just have a whole bunch of them, given the size of the human body.In short, this book delivers its title. 'nuff said."
5,PERFECT.,PERFECT SELLER & ITEM i like this flash memory so much & the seller is very very GOOD.. it reached me in a good time..thanks seller :)
4,layered listen,"I'm not a musician but I think the comparisons to McCann's electric piano style and that of Stevie Wonder in the mid-70s are quite accurate. Some of these tunes do invoke a similar mood and style. These compositions don't jump out at you, but seep into your brain and grow and grow until they become familiar. Layers indeed! I love albums like this that fuse jazz and soul, creating a heady musical stew. Sometimes they are successful and sometimes a bit bland, but this album by Les McCann was one of the success stories."
4,Great Video,This is a great video with a plethora of insight and information on the art of video making and a must see for any videographer.
4,Cute,Brought this for a co-worker who loves flamingos. She loves it and its a good size for a beanie bear.
5,The First Hundred Yeara: A Short History of Cobb County Georgia,"This a reference book I have been looking for since 1977. My father's family is mentioned in the book, and I only had poor xeroxed copies of some of the pages I had made at the library to share with other family members for documentation. The book I got is a new reprint, but I am more than pleased. It was reasonable for a reference book and was delivered promptly. Thanks"
2,odd,"This here album is like that 3d chips commercials, you know, that one with those two fat black guys rapping in a wierd squeaky voice."
5,you need this book,"There are already many good reviews written about this book.So I just want to add,you need this book if you want to become a day trader.It tells you about the essentials about order entries, order routings and Nasdaq Level 2.Also the new Nasdaq Super Montage which will be implemeneted in 2002 (thus making Level 2 and its entry strategies obsolete) is covered and explained in this book.All the online brokers are advertising with their quick executions. But any market order at any online broker is quick.You're not really that quick as long as you don't know how to tell an ECN or a Market Maker and as long as you don't know where to route your order via direct access trading (which isn't that expensive anymore)."
3,TV in 1949 had a better picture,"There really ought to be some standard, some criterion cutoff, before which Warner should allow a print of one of their films to be marketed. This print would not meet any meaningful standard. It's so bad in so many spots, that every time you just about get involved (or re-involved) in the films's story line (i.e., actually forget that you're watching a movie), the celluloid's artifacts double, triple, or even quadruple their annoying presence in the picture frame so as to upend your (periodic) ""suspension(s) of disbelief."" Too bad, really, because the acting was good, and the ending was quite poignant.I've purchased some fine copies of much older silent films from Warner Archives [e.g., ""La Boheme"" (1926), with Lillian Gish: a wonderful film], but this one is only for students of film, or diehard Garbo fans."
3,Hardly Anti-Semitic,"I read this book while a student of Dr. Mezvinsky at Central Connecticut State University. After seeing some of the reviews criticizing it as anti-Semitic I felt compelled to offer a few remarks. Firstoff, I believe that while the book presents a critical, controversial history of Jewish fundamentlism it can hardly be characterized as anti-Semitic. Those who feel this way are the same people who blantantly refuse to acknowledge the illegality of Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and policy of settlement expansion in these territories.Secondly, I want to say that while Professor Mezvinsky is perhaps not a widely reknowned scholar he does possess an outstanding knowledge of the topic and again it is ridiculous to label him as anti-Semitic. It is true that he strongly disagrees with the pro-Jewish policies of the state of Israel, but this simply means that he is more of a human rights advocate than his critics would like one to believe."
3,Good but....,"I felt it wasn't balanced enough. There are religious fanatics whereever you find organised religion, I don't think the majority of Israeli's feel the same way as the Haredim. In a sense, they are as much threatened by their religious extremism as Palestinians are because they would also be excluded from power in such a theocracy. However, the book is necessary because a lot of Jews are brought up to believe that Jews are incapable of inflicting the same sort of horrors that we faced in Europe and that Israel's blatant land grab is justified by our history. The teachings of Meir Kahane et al. prove that we are not exempt from the racism which made people like Hitler try to destroy us."
2,Problems with this product,I have a three car garage with a total of 750 sq feet. I scrubbed the floor and rinsed it well before using the etch. The garage is humidity controlled and was at 78 degrees while working on it. I followed directions to a tee. Each kit had a different consistency. The end result was a garage with three different shades of tan. Very noticeable. The product takes much longer to dry then the instructions state. It has been curing for a month now and today I moved a tool box with wheels over it and it left marks. Would hate to think what parking my car on it would do. I will have to see how this ends up after a few more months and will report at that time. Do to the different consistencies of the kits and the different shades of each kit I would guess Rust-Oleum has a serious quality control issue. I would not recommendthis product.
3,"Fast Shipping, Different Product.","The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
3,I've gotta good idea why you're here,"Is it for ""It's a New Day"" by any chance? If you don't have this, then click ""Buy Now"" and add one of the all-time classics to your collection. By itself, this fantastic tune justifies the price of admission. And if you're a beatmonger digging deeper? Weeeell.... the rest of this album is an enjoyable, if inessential, slice of soul'n'funk. You _can_ live without it. I guess it's a shame the enigmatic Skull Snaps never got more material onto disc. But when your only album includes one of eternity's phattest drum breaks, I'd say you've done enough already."
2,vocals need work,"Amorphis is a band that shined when gutteral vocals were used. This style with their excellent musianship struck a chord in my soul. This album has great guitar work, keyboards, percussion and is generally very well orchestrated. The vocals are poor. It really is upsetting because the first 30 seconds of each song are great and then the singing starts and the song goes to hell. The vocals are frequently sung too high and off key and without any emotion whatsoever. I think this album would have been excellent if the style was of the gutteral growl with some selected clean. The bottom line is Amorphis is very talented, and it is a shame that the vocals make this album mundane."
4,A Wealth of Music For A Small Price,"Dover publishing has succeeded in printing a very affordable edition of the Bach-Gesellschaft editions of these major Bach works. The only complaint is that the print is rather small, so there's not much room to write in fingering,of which there are none. So this book, by the nature of the music and the lack of fingering, is not for the beginner.That's the only complaint that prevented a five-star rating. Recommended, despite the print size!"
4,Excellent one-volume value,"This reprint of the Bach Gesellschaft of the English Suites, French Suites, Partitas, Goldberg Variations, and 2 and 3 part inventions is well worth the price. Though the edition has been superseded in accuracy by the Henle edition, this is a far better value. To become acquainted with these gems, this volume is exceptionally fine. Also handy is the fact that all these works are put together in a small, portable, not-too-heavy volume. That is especially handy for packing as one of those ""just in case I get stranded on a desert island (with a piano!)"" music books when traveling. So, though the Gesellschaft edition is not always the best, the price and portability are great."
5,Another Great product from Amazon!,Love this chrome bug deflector. It arrived within 2 days and was exactly as described on the amazon website.Fits my truck perfectly and looks good! Thanks Amazon!
1,rofl,haha too funny image has a sticker that they paid $25 and are selling it here for $40some people just amaze me shakes head
2,Not so much,"I didn't like this little craft iron. I wanted it to remove wrinkles and open seams on extremely small pieces. But it never seemed to get hot enough for this purpose, despite using a spray bottle to dampen the fabric. (And no, I wasn't saturating the fabric, just lightly misting, like I used to do in the days before a steam iron.) The cord was clumsy, I thought it was because the cord was stiff, but perhaps it was the positioning. I used an ironing mat, which was ridiculously expensive but adequate. I think next I will try the smallest travel iron I can find and a sleeve board."
3,Insightful,"I haven't finished reading this book, but have already learned some things. There are particular chapters on diet, mood swings and perimenopausal symptoms described that were like light bulbs exploding. It brought better understanding of the things I'm experiencing, and being able to say, ""Oh yeah!"" Good reference material."
2,Not a useful resource,"I bought this book after seeing Dr. Northrup on [a television] show. I was very disappointed in the book as a whole. I find it difficult to lend credence to someone who relies on tarot cards to answer difficult life questions. I also do not adhere to the concept that hormone imbalances, hypothroidism, etc. are all due to unresolved issues in one's life (specifically involving family, and partner). The idea that thyroid dysfunction develops as, ""the result of a lifetime of 'swallowing' words"" a woman ""is aching to say,"" is laughable at best. I believe many could potentially find this book more harmful than helpful. I'm sure there are wonderful resources available for today's active, educated women....this unfortunately is NOT the resource."
1,The self deception of this book,I purchased this book because the reviews I had read made it sound as if it were full of sage advice from a medical professional. I was sadly mistaken. Ms. Northrup has used the stage of menopause to cover her needs to assert her self as a valuble human being. It was disapointing to me to hear someone who should command respect expound the use of things like Tarot cards ro decide her future. The most bizarre part of this book was her comparison of her fibroid tumor to an embryo... But instead of getting the appropriate help she 'nursed' her tumor and used it as a way to explain her need to release her inner self... She consistantly makes blanket statements concerning medication and herbs... Please don't use this book as an excuse to become self centered and please don't believe all you read!!!!!!
1,The Wisdom of Menopause,"I would have given this a 5, based on the medical information. I was disappointed that there was no indication on the book jacket, or anywhere else for that matter, that Dr. Northrup chooses to use tarot cards and other such media to determine paths for her life's journey. I think that would be a significant topic to address in a review of such a book, especially by a medical professional. THe medical information is quite good, and I will use it for such. However, I will not recommend this book to anyone else."
1,What other alternatives do the disgruntled readers suggest ?,"I have bought the book, but have not read it yet. Given that many of the reviews are so poor, I may not read it. But, can one of the disgruntled readers suggest another alternative that addresses pattern designs specific to Java?"
3,Top Shot Joystick,"I bought this joystick without realizing that it is only compatable with Win95 and Win98. There seems to be no XP drivers avalilable on the net, so I gave it away."
4,a book about loyalty,"This is a fun book for anyone who loves tractors. But it is more than that--it illustrates the bond of loyalty in a way children can relate to. Micah and his Grandpappy are approached by a tractor dealership owner about replacing Grandpappy's rusty, old tractor with one of his new, feature-loaded, electronic models. Grandpappy is not so sure about the new ones, said his faithful old tractor has served him well and he would wager on getting through this season with it. The tractor salesman is stubborn and makes Grandpappy a deal--what happens next isn't what you might think!"
2,For Advanced TESOL study only,"If you're looking for a general book about TESOL, or how to teach English then this book is probably not for you. In my opinion, this book was written for Master's and Doctoral students in one of the TESOL or lInguistics fields, who need to study or teach about how to analyze written discourse. However, with all that said, it is a fine book, but dense."
3,"Quite good, nice crunch","These crackers are great. I think they are the best low-carb cracker option. However, the dried flax does seem to get stuck in your teeth, not the seeds like you would think, rather the munched up cracker. Eating them with something helps. I still think this is a great way to eat flax, I've not found any realy good way to use the ground seed."
1,mexican golden flax crackers,The crackers were stale and not very palatable to me. I will not order them again.
5,The day Christ died,I have read this book for yrs..during Lent and now my book has finally fallen apart is badly that I can no longer hold the book together in order to read...So I am going to try this so I will have the book forever I hope..this is a fantastic book and I think anyone interested in the bible would like it.. coincided about copyright date..I have read it for yrs yet it says 2008I think??
5,The Day Christ Died,"Jim Bishop writes a book that is not only Biblically accurate, but it is also entertaining. Although I do have a word of caution, remember this is fiction! He has taken Biblical fact and blended them together with fiction to create an understandable flow events during the ministry of Jesus Christ. Nonetheless, Jim does a great job bringing the reader into the Age of Jesus' time using historical research. He reviews the Jewish background (e.g., Law, customs, and more), as well as articulating the structure, politically and religiously, of the Roman Empire. Again, Jim Bishop writes an outstanding book that will educate everyone, and give all Christians who read it a deeper sense and appreciation of what Jesus did for all people."
2,"Interesting, but comic?","It was a new experience, reading a novel through without once caring one way or another about the protagonist. Alice Thrift has so little personality of any kind, it's difficult to think of her at all, either with affection or ill-will.However, this book is being marketed as a comic novel, and I don't believe I found any of it amusing in any way at all. The only emotion I recall registering was mild melancholy (because Alice Thrift seems to represent a banal mean seen in too many people these days who mistake a job for a life). Perhaps I prefer a bit more aggression in my comic novelists (Patrick Dennis, Dawn Powell, Jonathan Coe, P.G. Wodehouse), but I don't think this is comedy."
5,I love this book!!!,"I am currently listening to this book on cd and I am so thrilled to have finally found such a great witty writer. Often, it is a challenge to find books that are funny, witty, uplifting, fun and also exquistedly crafted with a marvelous use of the language. I can hardly wait to find out how this book ends and to read her other books. Ms. Lipman, I am so impressed with your creativity and writing skill!"
3,Better Luck Next Time,"For fans of Elinor Lipman's brilliant novels, this one might well be a disappointment. I couldn't find much to root for in her protagonist, a brainy surgical intern with zero social skills, and there wasn't enough about the more interesting secondary characters to redeem the novel for me. As for Alice's unorthodox fudge salesman suitor, Ray Russo, it seemed as if Lipman couldn't decide how she felt about him. One minute he was showing incredible thoughtfulness toward Alice, and the next minute he was portrayed as a hopeless cad. Based on my past experiences with the author, however, I've given the book one more star than it really deserves. For those unfamiliar with Elinor Lipman, don't hold this one against her. Try any of her other novels, and enjoy."
1,Gate pushes right over and won't stay locked,"This gate won't stay locked or secure. On the appropriate setting for my opening, I can push it right over pretty easily. (It's at the top of the stairs too, so this is very dangerous). If I tighten it one more notch, as soon as I push the bar down, it pops right back up. I'm sorry I bought this one."
2,Breaks easily,"When mounted at a tension that kept it firmly in the doorway, it put enough stress on the wood that it broke. We repaired it, and it broke in a new location. Get this product instead: http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Nature-Next-Gate/dp/B001PYQWXY/ref=pd_cp_ba_1. It's prettier, made of sturdier and smoother bamboo, and it is reinforced in all of the places where this gate failed.If you have an irregularly shaped doorway, none of these gates work well, though, so keep that in mind."
1,junk,did not fit in my doorway. the notches are too far apart. one was too loose and the next was too tight and snapped the bar right in half. I'm glad I only paid ten dollars for it but that was still too much for junk I only used twice
4,"Great for infants, not good for persistent toddlers","I highly recommend this for younger walkers and crawlers because it really is a strong gate. As your child gets to the age where he learns how to climb, however, beware because the mesh gives little ones a good foot hold. Even though my nephew learned how to climb over the gate, it never fell over (due to his weight) - proof that it is an extremely sturdy product despite the fact that it latches on due to pressure alone! So I give it a four. It's a great product for the price you pay but it is not perfect in design. Oh, and another thing, try not to let your little ones watch you set up the gate... they learn real fast once their problem solving capabilities kick in!"
3,So-so,"I bought this to block my dogs. It's great as long as the wall is perfectly square and there's no baseboard; otherwise, it's kind of hard to get a nice, tight fit while having to hold it up over the baseboard and size it at the same time. It keeps the dogs out, but if they were to try, they could definately knock it right over."
1,OutDated and Obsolete,"This Book was written way back in 2002 and the examples were implemented on Weblogic 7.0.Weblogic server 7.0 does not exist today which means if you are trying to run the examples(on the latest WL server) in the book you will have to change the dependencies in the ANT(provided in the examples) according to the configurations of the current server you will be using.This would mean more Overhead and waste of time changing the ANT files and the configurations of the Server apart from learning the already huge topics of Web services.I wonder what the authors were doing all these days without updating the book.Definetly,NOT recommend this book for those new to Java and J2EE."
5,Forgive and Love Again,"After years of living with the hurt, disapointment, bitterness and pain of an alcoholic husband, I read Suzanne's book. It was like she was writing the story of my life. The words and actions of her father are the same words and actions that I have lived with.I am able to understand that what happened to my husband is not his fault, but a disease that he is afflicted with.I no longer feel the need to get revenge or to fix the problem. I can live with the disease and know that it is up to him to seek help. It is not my problem to fix, but I do the best I can to love him and give any help that I can. If alcoholism is making your life hell, please read this book."
3,Why they call it Alcoholics ANONYMOUS,"The 11th Tradition in Alcoholics Anonymous expressly states that members should maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, film (and in modern days according to the AA General Service Office, TV and the internet). This is because we don't want to have leaders or spokespeople. Not only is Suzanne violating this tradition, but so are the people who are commenting on this site who are leaving their full name.AA saved my life, yes, but the traditions, not promotion, is what will keep it alive.Thanks for listening/reading."
4,good book,"This is a good book and I really appreciate the thrill of the story. I can't say that the author is one of my favorites, but she tells a great story and the book is very hard to put down!"
2,"Fabric is rough, cheap-looking","For a product with ""chenille"" in the name, I expected the fabric to be soft...and these are definitely not very soft. The fabric is a little thin and does not feel like something of high quality. Much scratchier than every other chenille item I've ever owned. And honestly, these pillows LOOK cheap....good thing I only paid $7!"
5,Great for transitions into crib,This spacer is perfect for when you are moving your little one from a cradle or bassinet into a full size crib. We keep moving it down as she grows and gets used to her additional space. We wish we'd had it right away instead of two weeks of trying to use the crib and lots of tears all around.
2,Was not as useful as it seemed to be.,"This seemed like an awesome product for me when I first bought it. But, I didnt really use it much with my twins. My boys slept in the same crib for about 4 months. At that time I used it in between them assuming one would disturb the other. But, it never happened like that. Since at 4 months they were not still mobile and they really didnt get into each other's space. It seems like a great product but I didn't get much use from it. I paid $25 and it was not worth that much."
4,"Great for twins, at least for a little while.","The crib spacer is great when you want to keep twins in the same crib after they've started rotating and possibly rolling around the crib. It keeps them from rolling and scooting on top of one another.I imagine it's also good for transitioning single babies to a crib who have been used to a bassinet or co-sleeper. You can keep their environment small and cozy and adjust the position as the baby grows. Installation is easy and it was very secure.It served its purpose for a short time, but it's too bad that it's so bulky. It takes up a lot of length of the crib, shortening its life span."
4,Clarence Penn anyone?,"1. I have no problem with the instrumentation or aesthetic choices made here; I'm down with this ""sell-out.""2. I'm really digging Clarence Penn, whom I had never heard of until I got home with this disc. (Kudos to the recording engineer.)3. It took me a couple of listens to notice (duh!) the ""Boplicity"" passage in ""Penelope."" I don't know, I just like clever references like this (a bit less obvious than Dexter Gordon's manner of quoting).4. It would be a crime for Douglas not to record this band live. Keith and Miles aren't the only artists deserving of live boxed sets.5. 5 stars is for 'Kind of Blue' or the Blanton-Webster Band; 4 stars is for a gem like this. Four and a half, actually."
4,Something Old Something New,I can't argue with the reviewers below who note the Stylistic similarities to Miles 2nd Quintet sound but I hesitate to emphasise that aspect of this fine recording because it would not do justice to the excellent musicianship on display here. Dave Douglas and his group have produced a very fine collection that stands on it's own merit. The electric piano does give the set an overall retro feel but it is used to great effect and the music sounds fresh and very energetic to my ear. I'd highly recommend this CD and I would love to catch this group perform live.
5,GGGGGRRRRREEEEEAAAAATTTT CD,"Why has this Cd received no air play? most of the tracks remind of the '70s and the great Funk music from ""Back in the day"".nothing I say could properly describe how good this CD is..Well Done Guys,this is fantastic work...For me the best track is ALWAYS(instrumental).....the entire CD is worth the purchase Don't miss out on this one."
2,May not work with your car and car seat,"I thought this looked like a great idea. And I'm sure it is for some car seats in some cars. But with our Century infant car seat in our Subaru Outback, there is not enough belt in between the seat and the anchor (where you are supposed to put the Mighty-Tite, so I can't use it -- altho I have no reason to think it would not work well with other configurations."
5,My carseat doesn't budge!!!!,"I know we have all probably said a few choice words to those brass clips that come with carseats. They are both a pain to install and don't feel very secure. I purchased the Mighty Tite on a whim and have been sleeping better ever since! I have recommended it to friends as well. It's a sinch to install and when done properly, you carseat hardly moves!"
1,DO NOT USE!!!!!,"I had this installed on our car seat thinking it was a great product. I then went to a car seat check point and was told by the technician checking the seat that these were very dangerous. They removed it and got the seat just as tight without it. Highly recommned not buying. If you take your car seat to most fire stations or police stations (call ahead), most are happy to assist in getting the seat in correctly and snugly!!!"
1,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT,"First of all, i got this product hopeing it would help. I could never get the seatbelts tight enough to securely hold my daughters carseat. WHEN i got this thing, i thought this is great! OH HOW WRONG I WAS! THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET. Came to find out that this wonderful product had stretched the seatbelts in both my car and my husbands, making them UNSAFE FOR ANYONE TO USE. We spent over 1,000 dollars because we had to replace 3 seatbelts in our cars! but the WORST THING ABOUT IT IS THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TO REPLACE A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS SEATBELTS AFTER THEY HAD USED THIS PRODUCT. DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT: READ THE EXPERTS COMMENTS ON THIS PRODUCT AND THEN DECIDE IF IT WORTH THE RISK. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN ANY CITY WILL GLADLY INSTALL YOUR CAR SEAT FOR YOU."
1,waste of money,"following the guide that came with your car seat eliminates the need for this device. Basically I put my knee in the center of the car seat and put about half my weight into the car seat, tighten the belt and poof I am done...this widget does basically that, but consumer reports and other similar organizations/agencies concur it is a waste of money."
1,Should not be used,"This item should never be used. Any Child Safety Seat Technician Instructor will tell you...if it doesn't come with the seat, DONT use it. The locking clip that comes with the seat will do the EXACT SAME THING...no need to purchase anything else. If you have misplaced a locking clip, most car dealerships will offer them free of charge. Don't waste your money on this product."
4,Common Sense...,"So here's what you do...A) put the seatbelt through your child's carseat as per the carseats instructionsB) attach the Mighty Tite to the seatbelt as per the Mighty Tite instructionsC) tighten seatbelt through REGULAR means (w/out Mighty Tite) as much as possibleD) pull yellow lever of Mighty Tite 2-3 timesYou use your common sense... you don't OVERtighten a seatbelt either. If yourMighty Tite is getting STUCK on the seatbelt, you've obviously wrapped the seatbeltseveral times around the Mighty Tite & that's way too much."
1,Garbage...,"Product is trash... Belts are still loose. Save yourself the money and go to your local fire station and let them install your car seat for you.Your child will thank you for it, if a situation goes south..."
5,BEST PRODUCT IN THE WORLD,I would recommend this to every parent that owns a car seat and does not have the vehicle with the clamps in the newer cars. This is the best invention ever made. This Mighty Tite gets my childrens car seats so tight they dont move. I am so glad someone came up with this product. Good for you. And THANK YOU.
1,Was removed by Inspector,WE purchased 2 of these items 1 for each car. We took our cars to be inspected yesterday and 2 separate inspectors removed them from our cars. We have been told that they have not been certified as safe and should not be used with the car seat. The officer inspecting my car informed me that all inspectors are trained to remove the product when checking the seat and they do not reconmend using the Mighty Tighty. Please have your seat inspected and installed properly before buying this product. We bought ours an the advise of the sales associate at the store and now I am sorry I did. I bought it to make my child safer but anything that is not certified to got with the car seat actually puts the child at risk because no one knows how it will react in a crash.
4,An aural journey through diverse cultures,"Quite an eclectic mix of artists and music. I am not sure this CD is for everyone...From hypnotic instrumentals to howling blues to middle eastern influenced dances to chill dance grooves to classical piano to latin salsa, the soundtrack takes you on an aural journey through diverse cultures. I'm sure it reflects the culture clash depicted in the movie's storyline.Listening to the sample tracks (at Barnes & Noble.com) makes me wish that I lived in a more culturally diverse area... This is the type of movie I have to watch on DVD because theaters won't risk showing independent films here.To find the sample tracks at B&N; search for ""Yes"" as the title, then sort the results by ""date released"". Since it just came out, it should be near the top of the list. Enjoy.BTW, my 4-star rating is based only on the sample tracks I was able to hear."
2,John's,customer service does not reply to your e-mail and they give no tracking info or shipping info
3,haven't used the book yet,Haven't used the book yet. Some recipes are not appropriate for the region where I live.
4,Good Book...,This is a great great book that covers network security issues and keeping your network safe.
4,"More, please.","If you want some meaty Catholic content without convoluted style, this is the place to go. Even if you're not Catholic, you'll find substantial and thought provoking material. OSV also provides groundbreaking stories that are timely and well researched. It's a quick and easy way to get a sense of current issues affecting Catholics and others in very clear terms. Best of all, it doesn't involve much of a time commitment on the part of the reader. Too bad more reading materials as well designed to communicate quality information in an almost effortless manner."
1,OSV,"I have yet to receive a single issue. I am less than pleased. Money deducted, no issues received to date. I am a big fan of OSV, but to not even receive a single issue after paying for a subscription has me very disappointed and angry."
1,Malfunction in less than 12 hours,"I purchased this unit on a Sunday afternoon and set it up that evening. Everything seemed to work fine. The next morning I emptied the water and from then on the controls have malfunctioned. All of the control lights are on and the unit doesn't respond to any of the controls. It runs, sometimes at high fan, sometimes on low, but who knows at what settings.I have turned the unit on/off, unplugged it, etc., but to no avail. The instruction booklet isn't very helpful. Nothing in the ""troubleshooting"" section that addresses this glitch. Since I can't set the humidity rate or any other control, I'm returning it ASAP."
5,My son loves to read this book,"My 11 year old son, who seldom enjoys any book, loves to read this book. He brings it to my husband and I to share the interesting stories."
3,Slightly Flat,"I got this movie because I like the work Cuba Gooding Jr. and Christian Slater, both fine actors, who did what they could with this rather flat take on the ""war of drugs"" film. The story was a predictable good guy vs. bad guy film, with a suffering cop out for revenge, so don't expect any groundbreaking story telling. It's an enjoyable enough movie to watch, with some nice action, and the bad guy getting what he deserves in the end."
5,The most comfortable bra I've worn in years,"This Bra is the most comfortable Bra I've worn in many years. Past bras have either left scars or were so uncomfortable that as soon as I got home, off it went. The wire-free is what I like the most. It give me lots of lift and support without all the bells and whistles. Love it!!! Who would of thought I would have found the best bra I ever had on-line. I had no high expectation when I ordered it but I am pleasantly surprised."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I bought this bra to accomodate my growing maternity size. The cup size was perfect and the straps supportive, but because it was wireless, the band squeezed extra tight & was extremely uncomfortable."
3,not great,The bra gives a very cone shaped appearance and is also not lined at all. you cannot layer the white one with another light fabric without a spaghetti top or another layer. it is comfortable but not well thought out in design.
3,bali double support bra,"I wanted a bra that would be comfortable for around the house.. Unfortunately this one had a lot of support,yet i wouldn't be able to wear a T-shirt and go out in it. I genuinely love Bali bras it just wasn't what I was looking for. To restricting for home and to revealing for going out. Other than that it is a very well made product."
4,Cold hard logic,"Berger was politically a liberal, meaning that he favored centralized government control of the lives of the citizenry. He was an honest liberal, however, and, based on his sound scholarship, rejected the self-defeating notion of a constitution which is ""living,"" i.e. a written law which is not law, but whim. Predictably, Berger was reviled by his fellow liberals. This is despite the fact that he was praised highly for books on impeachment and executive privilege which, by mere coincidence, were published when Nixon was being run out of Washington. Born in Russia, brought to the U.S. as a boy, Berger did not publish a book until age 68. His work on the 14th Amendment is a masterpiece of American legal scholarship."
2,Nice Looking Shoe,These are really a nice looking shoe but they don't last .in 2 months the strings have broken and the sides have blown out. My son skates and these shoes did not preform. Cheaply made shoe for not cheap price.
2,Amazon - Kindle- Miss Parloa's New Cook Book,"A good insight of cooking at the turn of the century.The recipes cover a great variety of vaious ingredients, some based in the new england area.The book refers to plates (pictures) but there are none in the kindle edition."
1,Don't waste your money,"The previous reviewer said she liked the first four chapters. I couldn't even finish the first one. I love the Stephanie Plum novels, but this was awful from the first page. There were so many absurdities, unlikelihoods, and ""get reals"" in the first 3 pages that I gave up. I wish I'd sat down with it in the bookstore for 5 minutes and I wouldn't have wasted my money."
1,"Aw, c'mon, Janet!","I love Stephanie Plum -- only book I buy pre-publication at full price. I was thrilled to think we'd be getting more Janet Evanovich. Forgetaboutit! I read the first chapter, and even that was a waste of time...not to mention money. Janet, you're doing yourself a disservice to let this book out."
1,I'm so disappointed,"After reading through all eight stephanie plum novels in the course of a week and a half this summer, I eagerly snatched up Full House at the book store, grateful for a ""fix"" before the next plum novel. I'm so sorry to say that it certainly did not meet my expectations. The relationship between the two main characters was boring and implausible. I didn't grow to like either one of them. I liked some of the secondary characters but they were not a big enough part of the book to carry it off. I am hoping that this book is not a hint of what is to come with future stephanie plum novels. I will be very sad."
2,Where's the Plum?,"A single mother of two becomes engaged to her polo instructor after knowing him only a few days. This is a story Ms. Evanovich had written earlier and resurrected it now that she's famous, adding some things to it for this publication. It promises to be like the Stephanie Plum novels, and it does not deliver. Characters are wooden. Dialogue is corny. There's no excitement. The only suspense is at the end, which perks up the story but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the book. Very disappointing, when this writer is capable of so much more."
1,She's no Stephanie Plum,I was SO disappointed with this book. I didn't even finish it. It had NONE of the snap of the Plum series. It was sappy and tacky.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan and was delighted she has something on the market outside of the Plum series, however, this book was a disappointment."
1,Full of What?,"This book was sophomoric, dull and an insult to all the loyal readership of Janet Evanovich. I am very disapponted. A waste of money."
2,not very good,tasteless-no flavor taste at all-filling with fiber but nothing else-may be healthy but i prefer to get flaxseed some other way
5,Ladies' Magnum boots,These are the most comfortable shoes that I have found so far. I am a delivery driver and am on my feet for 10 hours a day. These shoes are great
3,My War,"Combat is only part of war. Take it from an ex grunt,it's the hardships you endure between battles that is what war is about. Andy didn't spend time in a fox hole and doing without,it shows in his writing"
3,A middle-of the road slasher.,"Some Guy Who Kills people is entertaining enough to warrant a viewing for fans of slasher flicks, but one can't help but feeling it stops just short of being a *great* genre film. That said, it's not easy to assign blame to any one element of the film in that regard - the actors deliver admirable performances, the script is fairly clever, and the direction is competent. It's just that, when taken as a whole, it seems it could have been something... more."
5,Best Indie Horror-Comedy!,"Saw this on-demand on ComCast, definitely worth getting a copy! Best Indie Horror-Comedy I have seen in a long time. :-D"
5,Some Guy Kills People literally... and figuratively,"My Synopsis: There's this guy right, we'll call him Every-Guy-Who-Has-Survived Childhood-Prosecution But-Not-Without-Several-Years-of-Therapy; or Some Guy works too. More importantly, he kills people. No, really, it's in the title and this movie title doesn't lie. ~via [...]Read more at [...]"
4,Good but tough,"Very good reference, but very mathematically advanced and demanding. Has tons of material beyond any intro books.Some of the material is not easy to learn for the first time from this book. But if you have had a different intro to it then this book will provide another layer of deeper and advanced insight."
5,What's not to love?,"Classic edition, legibly present. I have to type 16 more words in order for my opinion to matter though !?"
3,I can see why this is a great portable game,"But on a console it really loses something.This puzzle game requires you to rotate a 2x2 block of two different colors and you clear them by creating rectangles of the same color.Yes, the game is addicting and strangely hypnotic at times, but the selection of this particular one is terrible. The ""Shinin'"" mode is the best, but many other modes are lame. In fact there really isn't much compared to both the PSPLuminesand 360 versions. No music videos and no downloadable content.Lumines is a great game...for your PSP.Lumines Plus is just ok."
4,good stuff here,I grew up on Hall&Oats&I was so up for hearing this Set which showcases Hall&Oats stripping down there material&bringing a few new songs to the mix.I really am glad that they are back because the Industry for the most part has some of the worst acts that I can ever recall in it's history.Hall&Oats are Good Songwriters&truly are story-tellers as this set Highlights.
5,Behind the Music missed the true story...This album didn't!,"Behind the Music struck out on the Hall and Oates story, but then being underrated and overlooked are par for the course for these guys. I only hope they are alive if and when they get their due. This CD is refreshing because it offers up new material from the duo. This collection is well worth the money and Do It for Love is a smash hit and Somebody Like You is beautifully redone. Now that Mottola isn't with Sony I bet he wishes he had the boys back in the stable.... sorry 3 times will not be the charm. I look for Daryl and John to have a great year and let the music world worship the ground they walk on!"
4,Emphasis on the soul/rock fusion here,"This seems to me to be more than just another Hall & Oates collection among several. There's an emphasis here on the unmistakable soul influence and how it blends in so well with the basic rock style, and this emphasis is helped by the juxtaposition of studio hits and live versions along with the Unplugged version of ""So Close"" and the three new songs.For sheer listening enjoyment, this CD falls a bit short though the great moments and the new songs make it worthwhile. But for a new and somewhat different perspective of the duo's career and of their importance in musical history, I definitely recommend it."
5,Great Book for new moms,This book is an easy read & very informative for new moms looking to breastfeed. It was recommended by my Pediatrician as a must read & I am glad I bought it.
4,"Comfortable, easy to wash and dry","I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me."
4,Super soft and Comfortable,"I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these. At first when I was sore and using nipple cream, I used the disposables. The yellow cream stains, so I didn't want to mess up my good pads. After I no longer needed cream, I moved on to the washable ones. I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables. I forget that I even have them on. I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables, but I don't really care. I don't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables (to me the J&J and Avent disposables are the most discreet). I don't leak much anymore, so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage. I have four pair. I generally do laundry once a week, with one load at some point mid-week. I'm able to always have some on hand."
3,ok for around the house - a bit bulky and prone to leaks,"Several observations:1. Shape - After you wash these, make sure you shape them so they can air dry in an acceptable shape.2. Bulky - They're still fairly bulky but work fine for around the house under my Bravado Original Nursing bra. Shaping it helps it look less bulky.3. Leaks - Occasionally I leak a lot, and these need changing after one ""let down."" If I don't change it, it's sure to leak through after 4 hours or so if I let down again. Also, they shift around too much sometimes. That being said, I wear them out if I'm just out as a mom; I stick with disposables when I do anything professional."
3,Reviewer one is a DMI sports employee,I have no idea how this thing will work it seems that keeping the ball in play messes up the game. plus I've had the ball cross the goal line many times with out it falling back. this review is to counter the obvious DMI sports guy.
1,Aggravating and insipid,"This review is directed towards Catholics, not curiosity seekers.""The Pilgrim's guide to Italy"" was written by a couple of practitioners of an Indian religion. Their selection of saints is strange and often ludicrously deficient. One example is their omission Saint Benedict and Scholastica. Many great saints are simply omitted due to the absurd whims of the authors and their biographies have been butchered in an attempt to make them politically correct. If one is an uncritical new age ""touchy-feely"" type who samples religions like snobs sample expensive wine, one might appreciate this book. However, for an orthodox Catholic it is obnoxious and glaringly deficient. There are better books out there anyway. Lucinda Vardey's book ""Traveling With The Saints In Italy: Contemporary Pilgrimages On Ancient Paths"" is markedly superior in tone, volume of information, and quality of content."
2,Awesome Catholic Pilgrim Guide Book of Italy,This book was an awesome reference on my recent pilgrimage of Catholic Italy with my church. Father Daren and several people asked me if they could use the book during the trip. Made me more spiritually ready as I visited the sacred sites. A lot of information. Thanks!!!
3,"They can do better, and have","After releasing five exceptional albums that by-and-large touched on the same themes, this work by Engenheiros do Hawaii shows the critic that even a lyricist as talented as Humberto Gessinger can wear a sure formula a little thin.Nevertheless, in one of the better tracks of this album (Muros e Grades- Walls and Bars), Engenheiros really articulate the theme of personal alienation. While this may well be conscious expansion on subjects that Pink Floyd had addressed over a decade earlier, it's by no means clumsy. The song also alludes to the reality of insecurity born of social inequality in Brazil. With a characteristic lack of excess sentimentality, 'Piano Bar' deals with two afflictions that feed off each other: loneliness and the shallowness of purely physical love.Most of the other tracks on this CD display a mediocrity that is otherwise atypical of this great Brazilian rock band."
3,I don't THINK so!,"Minerva: The First Volume of the Six Sisters is quite enough, thank you. I do not plan to check out the saga of the next five sisters...because frankly, my dear I don't care. Minerva is a well drawn character who is so absorbed in her own narrow view of the world and of church that she is unbelievable. This perception is further reinforced when she begins her sexual life with complete abandon! Not bloody likely, I'd say. The author expects us to believe that this ultra submissive girl can actually not even imagine that her father is a cad, her mother is a hypochondriac and that her entire family uses her! Even considering the time frame in history, I find this amazing.I only wish I could get it out of my Kindle archives! It takes up space, but has no weight."
1,I don't often stop before the middle of a book,"but I just didn't want to spend more time with this unlovely cast of characters. I won't spoil it for other readers, but I did reach a point where I said, ""Enough"". I am a solid fan of M. C. Beaton and have followed Agatha Raisin through thick and thin, even with all of her quirks and foibles. But Beaton's lost me with this one. I approach the others in the series with a lot of trepidation. Sorry that I can't be more explicit, but I am resisting spoilers."
3,Cheeky romance.,"Cute, just as I remembered from reading it as a teen. Quick and easy read, good for vacation or after a more serious read."
5,Pleased,"I was looking for this for quite a while, specifically the ""Death Watch"" story, the longest in the book, & the basis for a movie, ""Before Dawn"", with which I wanted to compare it.Book arrived in a timely manner, & readable condition. Thank you!Donald W"
4,An excellent place to begin,"Before buying this book, I'd not done much bread baking before. On the few occasions I had tried, invariably the results were lifeless white breads that seemed to have more in common with the flavor and texture of paste than bread. With Daniel Leader's book I learned the value of bread starters and slower fermentation. This lead to a marked improvement in the flavor and texture of my bread. (it also makes baking a lot more fun).My favorite discussion in the book is the description of the Levain and other wild yeast breads. The procedure for creating a starter in the book worked surprisingly well for me and the resulting bread is fantastic. I'm now an ""avid"" baker and my family and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment from the start I found in this book."
3,"A Great Document, Though Not The Best","Released as one of a series of CDs dedicated to the ""Songs of Bob Dylan"" (See another in this series under The Byrds), this CD offers wonderful interpretations by a band that was one of Dylan's greatest interpreters. Both Jerry and Bobby have time and again dug into the Dylan treasure chest for material that they molded into their own seemingly without effort. Why only three stars, then? Well, there are just too many tracks from the Brent-tinkling-on-the-DX7-synth era for my taste. I've seen and heard the Dead play Dylan from the Keith-and-Donna incarnation, through the Brent years, to Dylan and the Dead (at JFK Stadium in Philly no less), and even the Vince and whoever else joined him on keys last lineup. So ... I wish this particular collection would or could have dug out performances from a deeper vault. Finally, check out the Jerry Garcia-Merle Saunders ""Live at the Keystone"" CD's for some excellent Dylan interpretations. Happy trails!"
1,ladybug costume,This was very cheaply made. It did not last three dressings. Not worth the money. My daughter had to go trick or treating with the skirt falling off!
3,cute,Bought this for my daughters Halloween and she was cute but the costume was almost too small. She is 2 almost 3 so I didnt expect that. Also some of the feathery trim had to be resewn on in parts but all in all ok
3,Cheap edition,"Always loved this film and finally decided that I should have the iconic soundtrack songs and dancing music too. Unfortunately the particular edition being sold now is sadly inferior. I almost wouldn't mind the jewel case insert that looks like it comes from a template in Microsoft Word. However what's worse are how the track titles and numbers printed on the case are quite simply wrong. Something must have become shuffled at some point so it's all the same songs, just in a different order. Great music, poor release. I would recommend what I've already owned for awhileSomething For Everybody: Baz Luhrmannwhich has nice highlights from Strictly Ballroom."
5,Just as Described,"I read many of the reviews and decided this would be my best option. It arrived today and worked exactly as described, straight out of the box. I lifted it out of the box, installed the top handle by inserting 2 screws that were provided, opened the gas line butterfly valve, poured some 2 cycle gas mix in and pulled the handle twice. It started right up, and within seconds was running smoothly. The sound level is about what you would expect from a 2 cycle weed eater idling. No problems. I have run it for about an hour without issues under a load. This generator appears to be solidly built - mostly metal."
1,Didn't work out of the box,"The generator started and ran fine out of the box, but didn't actually generate any current.I submitted a support email to Eastern Tools, but didn't receive a response. I then called their support line. They offered to send me a new capacitor to see if I can fix it myself, which is fine with me if it works. Unfortunately, they expect it to take a week to ten days for me to receive the part, and there's no way of knowing if the fix will be successful.They seemed pretty nonchalant, considering the fact that they sold me a product that didn't even work."
3,Boycott Copy Protected CDs--Make a Stand!,"Saw her on ""Real Music"" very very promising...unfortunately this album is copy-protected. After decades of price-gouging they have the nerve to inhibit fair use...you'd think they would have been fattened enough by the millions and millions of Twenty dollar cds they sold us in the eighties...apparently not. The record companies are struggling because of bad business decisions, not illegal copying.Sorry Tristan, It has to start somewhere."
3,"Good artist, but DRM sucks...find her music live!","I had heard ""Shy That Way"" and ""Beautiful"" on the radio and was impressed, so I ran out to buy Tristan's studio album, not realizing that it was copy protected. Big bummer, as most of my music I listen to on my iPod or on my car CD player that doesn't play most of the fancy formatted type discs. So this is a partial downer on the cd itself, since I don't know how much I'll be able to listen to it.However, Tristan the artist is great and I love her music. Don't dismiss her just because of the crappy record labels and their desire to control how consumers listen to music -- trust me, it's NOT her call! She allows taping and trading of her live concerts, so she WANTS to get her music out there! Buy copies of her older, non-protected singles and EPs so she can make a living, but just search for Tristan Prettyman's live archive and enjoy this fantastic artist to your heart's content."
1,Don't Purchase Copy Protected CDs,Make your opinions known to the record companies by not purchasing copy protected CDs. They restrict your ability to play freely on all forms of media players and they restrict your ability to rip and move to a variety of MP3 players. There's nothing wrong with wanting to receive revenue for music but you shouldn't have to give up your freedom to use that media once you purchase it.
1,Terrible,So insanely cheaply made did not last 10 seconds before it was in pieces!! Do not waste your money. My dog managed to squeak it once before it literally came apart at the seams.
2,Non-goldfinches love it !,"This is a very attractive feeder and if only goldfinches could use it I'd be be very happy with the item. Unfortunately, house finches (who have their own feeder) seem to prefer the thistle seed and are quite capable of standing on a perch and stretching up to the the feeder hole above it. Each finch that does this essentially takes away TWO feeding stations from the goldfinches - the hole above the perch and the one below - so two house finches take up four stations, leaving only two available for the smaller and more timid goldfinches. And yes, there is a small platform under the feeder, just big enough for an ambitious house finch to brace against while it holds on to the metal frame above. This feeder empties out in just one day ....... and the goldfinches get very little of it."
2,disapointed,It was fun watching the goldfinches feed upside down.They however prefer to eat upright and would pass up this feeder for the normal feeder most of the time.But then after a rain...the seed got wet and spoiled immediately. Cleaning it and putting in more seed became a regular occurence.So I got rid of the feeder.
2,"Ok product, didn't work for me","There was no increase in muscle mass, it just made me pee more. I did also gain some water weight. Would not recommend."
4,striking,"this book is as if someone has punched you in the gut. i think the end wasn't revealed until it was the end, which is always good. i read this book in german, which may have caused me to miss a couple things, but it was very good nonetheless."
5,good for memories,we bought this as a gift to replace a scratched record and it was the perfect gift. It's just not Christmas without Kenny and Dolly at my mom's house so this was perfect.
5,You need this,"Helps your back, helps your arms... it is so taxing on you to get your baby in the right position and this little stool helps more than you think."
4,Good stool,"This is a really good stool. I have not used any other so I can't make a comparison but I am nursing now and have used it since day one and it is definitely better to use it than to go without it. I even wish it inclined a little more since I am on the short side. By the way, it needs to be assembled yourself but it's easy to do."
5,A must have for shorter nursing mothers!,"Love it! I'm 5'4"" which is just on the border of being short for a woman. I found this stool to be very useful and help with some of my nursing back issues. I honestly didn't realize I needed one until I tried on at my lactation consultant's office. This is a very good gift for any nursing mother who is 5'4"" or under."
5,Much needed purchase!,"I sat with this stool while still pregnant, and while it was nice, I had no idea how much I would enjoy it for nursing. My husband still uses it in the living room, and we may need to get another for him to watch TV with as it is very comfortable. We have a rocking chair, not a glider, to nurse with and use a nursing pillow, and this stool makes rocking and holding him so much more comfortable. I probably wouldn't even bother rocking otherwise, and he really likes the motion. This is one of the best items we purchased!"
1,Cancel My Appointment,Seems no one cared to review for a couple years. This author is new to me and my opinion of this book does not match the other reviews. I found it hard to buy the events in this story. The gulliblity of Steve was just too much. I could hardly finish the story. Why did it take him so long and need for eavesdropping equipment to realize his lover's involvement. I'm sorry but I'll take Robin Cook's thrillers any day.
3,Old Schlock Movies are the Best!,"I remember seeing this movie on late, late, LATE, one night back in the latter part of the 70's when TV networks still showed a variety of weird and wonderful old movies. (Sadly these days it seems that networks replay the same ten movies over and over ad nauseum. Basically its the story of a woman who's car breaks down on a deserted road. She ends up at the estate of a wealthy man who seems to be keeping people prisoner there. But all is not as it seems. One of the better schlock films in my opinion."
3,DECEPTIVE PHOTO BUT KNIVES ARE OK,"READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY, THIS IS FOR THE KNIVES ONLY NO PAINT PALETTES INCLUDED. THESE WERE BOUGHT TO REPLACE A MUCH CHEAPER SET OF KNIVES THAT WERE EVERY BIT AS GOOD QUALITY BUT WE PAID THE EXTRA BECAUSE OF THE PLAETTES INCLUSION ILLUSION. WE WILL KEEP BUT ARE NOT THRILLED WITH THE DECEPTIVE PHOTO USED TO DISPLAY THE ITEM, WE ADMIT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE READ THE WHOLE PAGE MORE CAREFULLY BUT SINCE WE DIDNT HAVE A REVIEW TO GO FROM THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING AS PICTURED ITEMS. WE WONT MAKE THE MISTAKE AGAIN, ADVISE TO GET THE CHEAPER KNIVES THEY ARE OF GOOD QUALITY AND MUCH MORE REASONAL IN PRICING. OVER 20 DOLLARS DIFFERENCE"
2,Disappointed,While this seems a great value-Gustav Leonhardt playing the Partitas and English Suites for under $20-there is a catch: None of the repeats are taken. I had to return the set.
2,oH MY GOSH!,I love Oshii's anime work. I was expecting Jin Roh the live action movie...I got it for about five minutes at the beginning of the movie(The suits looked awesome..very WW2 super soldier.) Then the bottem fell out. A drudging crawl of a satire about fascism and the... oh whatever... Buy the poster instead and you won't be disappointed. I'm a little biased in that I really wanted a cool Jin Roh live action movie following the actions of the Kerboros...it is not here. If you are a film student studying Oshii...go for it!
3,The Inimitable Jeeves,"I remember reading Wodehouse so many years ago when I was a child, and somehow I am not too impressed with the subject matter this time; perhaps I should have selected a different book from Wodehouse. Maybe I'll try that again later."
2,Junky plastic space waster,"This organizer is alright for the family that uses jarred baby food. I always had three times as many jars as it would hold.Not a lot of baby food comes in jars these days. It is so much cheaper and easier to make your own baby food, or just feed the baby what you are eating as soon as they have the proper grasp.I used this product for a month or so before I wised up."
1,Poorly Designed,"When filling the tub, water is still sent to the shower head and flows fairly well from it. Replacement Price Pfister Marielle spigots did not solve the problem; instead a different, non-matching, $15 unfashionable spigot rectified the problem."
2,Truth or ...... ?,"I always admired Mickey Rooney as a performer. He had tremendous talent. What a shame he lived his personal life the way he did. Even though I wasn't born until 1947, I grew up watching his movies on TV. I obtained a copy of the book recently and it is a quick and easy read. Yet I was astounded to read about his sexual exploits written in such a way that they belonged more in in a porn manner than in a book about his life. Obviously, Mickey isn't a gentleman and yet this book was supposedly written *after* he found God. About halfway through the book, when he related another startling episode about his life, I said to myself, ""He's making that up."" While most of the book is probably based on truth, I think Mickey also created some events out of his wise-cracking mind and then came to believe them himself, especially since those who could call him on them are now dead. While disappointed in him I will still watch his movies whenever I get the chance."
2,Not what I expected,I had been eating Wild Planet Sockeye salmon for about 3 months before I decided to give Redhead a try. I was very disappointed with both the texture (mushy) and the amount of bone content in the Redhead. The Wild Planet is clearly the better choice in my book. Thanks.
4,good movie,a good movie with some great stars. it contains dry british humor mixed with world war two subversive action by civilians.
2,Rip off of Soundstage DVD,"This looks like a bootleg copy of the wonderful Soundstage performance by Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers. The audio is excellent, but the picture is fuzzy. Support PBS by buying the real Soundstage Performance (available from Amazon)Soundstage Presents: Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Live, which gets five stars!"
1,Kings of PROFANITY is a better title!,"Having NOT seen the film AND possessing the knowledge about the PARENTAL ADVISORY warning, I purchased this hoping that only a few ""cuss words"" would be uttered. Boy, was I stunned.Steve, Cedric, Bernie, and DL bombard the ear with a constant barrage of four-letter words that mask as comedy routines.Give me Bill Cosby and his ""family-friendly"" anecdotes any day.This is only for fans of BET's ""Comic View"" of which I am not.I am sure that with the above words, I have not endeared myself to the many millions that watch both the show and have purchased this one.By the way, I gave it to my brother who appreciates their brand of ""humor""."
2,The Old School Song-Cedric,"The Old School Song Cedric has playing in the background when he is driving the car is ""Cutie Pie"" by One Way.....or is it ""One Way"" by Cutie Pie? Either way, that's the song. It's funky!!"
2,Cedric's Opening Song,Does anyone know the song that Cedric comes out to? I know I have heard it before by I can't remember what it is?
2,An amateurish and disappointing film,"Sadly, the videotape of some of Gaudi's buildings is a great disappointment. Badly photographed, badly lit, badly narrated, and badly mixed (sometimes it is impossible to hear the narration over the music), it is technically visually inferior to modern home videos and shows nothing that can't be better viewed in recent books. That's right,'modern' and 'recent'; the footage in this documentary was shot in the 1970s prior to the restoration of many important buildings. At best this would function as a 'before' picture. Not recommended. END"
2,Deogratias,"This is a graphic novel about the genocide in Rwanda. I liked the informational introduction. It was well done and very informative. That said, I did not like the book itself. The artwork didn't touch me, the story was confusing and unappealing, and I did not get anything out of it."
1,conflicting descriptions,"Item description says pack of 3 but product features section says ""one 6 oz tube"". Descriptions are conflicting and buyer cannot be confident about the product."
2,"Fairly good fiction, but not worth the money I spent on it.","This book is a misleading piece of rubbish as a factual record, but as a fiction it is fairly good. I have no sympathy for this woman. Surely she must now hide her head in shame from a town that tryed to help her, and the friends that she has lost. Not because of her disease but because of her betrayal to them."
3,"Alright, but...","I bought this book thinking:1. It would give my husband and I even more of a reason to have sex.2. We both needed to lose some weight and thought this would be a fun way to do it.3. Why not?After receiving it, I began to read it and was kind of disappointed. My husband and I are already pretty ""adventurous"" and this book kind of turned that into ""work"". It was a good read, but I have to say, I haven't tried any of that stuff.I think it would be an excellent book for people looking to try new things, but if you already have a well versed repertoire, this might suck the fun out of it."
4,Feeling guilty no more!,"Fed up with church is the feeling I have been hiding for some time now. I long for a deeper relationship with Christ yet, loathed the thought of another Sunday morning service.Thank you Frank Viola for helping me understand why I have these feelings and now because I understand I no longer feel guilty."
5,Missing Link,The well-documented historical basis communicated in simple language makes this a volume for all types of readers. To me it is a piece in the missing link of doing church in a way that sets us up to more easily facilitate the type of interactions and functions Jesus envisioned. Love it or hate it...you cannot read it and remain the same!
4,review for Pagan Christianity...,"This book seems to be great ive only read the first few chapters but love the information brought to light, and the wuthors did a great job of citing where they found ALL of their information"
5,An Indispensable Resource,"""Pagan Christianity"" is an indispensable piece of historical research. The arguments the authors lay out are clear, accurate, and very well documented. I believe this is a unique book that all Christians should read and openly examine against the Bible. It shows us the things we do for church that Jesus never intended. The follow-up work, ""Reimagining Church,"" is a must read companion to this book. It shows the constructive side of the discussion, exploring what Jesus intended for His church. Viola's newest book, ""From Eternity to Here,"" is his best work yet and gives the big picture as to why the church is so important to God in the first place."
5,Rocked My Religious World!,"Frank's books, especialy ""Pagan Christianity"" rocked my ""religious"" world and set me on a path for more. I was absolutely stunned at how many paradigms I had regarding my faith that were not substantiated in the Bible. Tons of fresh Biblical insight from two very couragous lovers of Jesus. Thank you for revealing the ""more"" in Christianity to this stay-home mom of 4! Enjoying the rocking immensely!!!"
4,Challenging,"This book will challenge the way you think about church, pastors, the Bible, and your own religious experience. The book is complete but could have included more history in contrast to modern trends in the church."
4,Answers to pre-Constantine questions,"I am on the last chapter of this book and have enjoyed it thoroughly. I had many questions about how the Orthodox Church came to their practices, and assumed it had ""always been that way"". Apparently not. No wonder I found myself unable to venerate relics or bow down to a bishop like he was the emperor! This book provides many resources for me to continue my research into what the first century Christian church was meant to be. I got the impression that this book was more for Protestants, but I learned something in every chapter about the foundations of Orthodoxy. It has rocked my world and I have already checked out several books from the library about the pagan roots of Christian liturgy."
2,What a letdown.....,"Wow, I was really looking forward to this book. I waited two months for it to come out. I pastor a emerging style church that has challanged many traditions so I am not upset from a traditionlist standpoint. I love Barna's stuff and couldn't wait for this one. While it has some interesting info to think through, I didn't realize it was just a big advertisment for organic churches. It's one thing to educate and discern, it's another to be a walking commercial that if you get it..leave your church quietly and not cause a stir, if you don't, well you weren't ready for the truth yet. And how do you have a book that talks against modern churches using video to ""entertain masses"" co-authored by one who owns a company that makes videos for the church. I still love Barna but the agenda (not the info) in this book was very unsettling to me."
5,Very happy,Very informative info on how and why current church practices came into vogue. A real eye-opener.
3,FRUSTRATING!,"While the pacifier thermometer is great in concept, it is quite bulky and larger than a regular pacifier. My daughter could not keep it in her mouth and with the slight fever and her crying, the pacifier did not read accurately. I have to use my regular thermometer. I probably wouldn't recommend it."
1,save your money,"I registered for this item thinking it would be a great idea. I tried it out on myself, and after five minutes, it was still trying to read my temperature. I immediately returned it to the store!"
3,"A good tale, but shallow.","This little story is tightly constructed and gripping. A rich lawyer is incarcerated during the war with a bunch of ordinary joes. As a result of hostage-type negotiations, a set number of them are designated for random executions. The prisoners draw lots to determine those to die, and the lawyer is one of the losers. Desperate to live, he offers all his estate to anyone who will trade places. The man who drew the 10th lot takes him up on the offer, accepts the estate as payment for his life, and has the lawyer make out a will leaving the wealth to his family. The guilt over this ""act of cowardice"" haunts the lawyer to his grave.This story is hard to put down and gracefully written, but the characters are relatively flat, 2-dimensional figures. They are useful symbolically, but not terribly convincing as real people. All in all the tale reads more like a parable than a novel."
3,WARNING!!!!,"That's a typo up there. This movie has NOTHING to do with Kieslowski (who made a 30 min. Polish film entitled ""Talking Heads."" ANyhow, DONT BUY THIS because you think it has anything to do with Kieslowski!!! It does not."
5,A fascinating book,"When I read this book for the first time in the mid 1970's I was blown away. Here is a taboo subject that no one is permitted to know'bout in today's society: that one (maybe, just maybe) doesn't just live once (or as the 1973 song went ""You only live twice, or so it seems, one life for yourself and one for your dreams...""). Of course everyone has a right to their own convictions: I am not saying you ought to read this book, it's entirely up to you, but if you are curious, as I was, about what really happens after death, there's plenty there to whet your curiosity and get you thinking, ""is that really the way it happens?"", ""How come I can't remember a thing ?"" You decide."
1,lettres stationary,"I was very disapointed with this stationary. They make it seem so much better online. DO NOT GET THIS, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!So now I have warned you.bye"
5,Fantaboulous,Only one Sentence :- This book is a treatise on how a novel should be written - this is what makes Crichton one of the greatest storytellers of our times.......
2,In Case of Need,Did not care for the story. It was too similar to another book on the same lines as this one. Gave the book away.
1,A Case of you Need to put it down,"i went on a ""read 'em all"" thing a while ago. the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news. i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone. i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true. i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.thank you for you timeyours truelyKruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop"
4,Crichton's First and One of his Best,"I've read three books by Michael Crichton: Case of Need, Airframe and Timeline. They have all been good, but this one was excellent in the way that it handled the very controversial topic of abortion. Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life you will probably agree that this book was well written. It's not hard to believe that he helped create ER after reading A Case of Need."
3,An Old Case of Need,"The conflict contained on this book is not too good. You cannot expect something like ""Sphere"" since eventhough, as usual, Crichton widen our insight by his knowledge, the story is not so ""suspense"""
4,Story Line for A Case of Need,"A Case of Need is a page-turner. A pathologist called John Berry is investigating the arrest of one of his best friends, Arthur Lee. He is convicted for aborting a girl named Karen Randall. As he goes deeper and deeper into the case, he finds more and more secrets and scandals until he finds a surprising culprit. You'll have to read the rest to find out who. If you like a thrilling story with some medical background then this is a book you'll enjoy"
3,Not as good as expected ....,"because, in my opinion, 1) there were too many characters than neccessary (I kept getting names mixed up), 2) a lot of jargons, terms, abbrieviations, etc., were very well explained, but the reason why Karen Randall had gained weight and become hairy prior to her death as noticed by almost every other character was omitted, surprisingly. I assume it was a symptom of being addicted to whatever she was getting high on or did I miss something? (If somebody would care to enlighten me, I'd appreciate it.), 3) Not enough 'suspense' factor. Otherwise, it was educational and thought-provoking."
5,Good as Goldie!,"Goldie's autobiography is a spiritual journey through her life - its touching and sincere accounts of life-changing events gives the reader a unique view into the life of a movie icon. What you realize is that Goldie is one of us - yes, an amazingly accomplished actress, but also a loyal friend, a loving mom, and a genuine, down-to-earth person.Most noteworthy is the fact that Goldie did not find the need to disparage anyone from her past in order to accurately tell her story.If possible, I'm more of a fan after reading her book."
3,Good book - could use a little more meat on it's bones though!,"I've always enjoyed the light heartedness of Goldie Hawn. She has a fresh airy style that makes most movies that she's in just that much more fun and entertaining.Her personal life has been pretty full of controversay over the years. Between her divorce to Bill Hudson...and the estrangement with her children. I had been really intersted to know more about ""why"". She barely mentions Bill Hudson. Really! I guess I could be more optomistic, and say that ""at least she didn't bash him...""....but I was a bit disappointed with the fact that she brushes over her relationships...and her kids. Still, she spends vast amounts of text talking about her trips to India, and riding on an elephant...and her relationships with people I don't care about at all. I bought the audio cd - which she narrates. She did a good job, but I couldn't help thinking that most of the time she sounded alot like Barbara Mandrell. Hmmm...I had never notice that before."
1,Undated,Call me finnicky but I want to know the year a movie was made. No where in the dvd packaging or in the dvd itself was this information made available . I suspect that it was made in the mid 1960's. As for the plot and my engagement I can't say much because it was obviously not a memorable experience for me.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I received this product as a gift and was really excited to try it out. First of all, you CANNOT shred as many pages at once as it claims, you can only shred 4-5 or it gets jammed. Second, it does jam quite often even when trying to shed 4-5 pages. Third, the gears are cheaply made, and some of the teeth shear off the gears each time the machine jams. After about a half a dozen times, the machine will stop working as one or more of the gears have no more teeth on it. Guess what! You cannot buy replacement parts for this item. It was made to break, so that you would have to purchase another one. I will NOT buy another Royal shredder as I have read this is not the only model that this happens to. Please save yourself the headache and buy a different brand."
4,Good low budget shredder!,For an economic and cheap shredder it meets the needs of home paper shredders
2,Lipiderm Healthy Skin & Coat So-So,"I bought this for my dog who was experiencing some allergies that were making her scratch her belly until the hair was gone and she was bleeding. So a pretty severe allergy. This medicine did not seem to help at all. I took her to the vet and she put my dog on a prescription medicine that helped immediately. I did finish giving all the gel caps to my dog, but again, did not notice that it did anything."
3,lipiderm,"just started using this product. did note some slight intestinal upset with this product. for my dog's size it says to give 2 caps daily per direction on label, but I switched to 1 cap only daily and the intestinal upset subsided. I feed this in addition to a very high quality kibble and due to the dry weather this time of year. this does help coat."
5,The best of his post-Pixies work,"If you had told me ahead of time that my favorite album of 2007 would be a Black Francis solo work, I'd probably have laughed and rolled my eyes.But truth be told, I've listened to this album more in the past year or so than any other I own. Why this didn't make a bigger critical splash is sad and baffling. While stem to stern there isn't a weak plank, the stand outs for me include ""Angels Come to Comfort You"" (a fine example of Francis' penchant for searing biography in song form) and ""You Can't Break a Heart and Have It"" (showing once again Francis' brilliant taste in covers and his ability to better his inspirations). Here's hopin' for more where this came from..."
3,Good for reference,"I used this book like a reference point. I wanted to buy crystals but was not sure about the properties, so i picked up this book. When i was buying crystal at the shop, i just searched for the crystal and its specific properties and bought them. Explanation are pretty much the same like in all other books or what you see in net, but its simpler and easy for reference"
5,Great Crystal Reference book,"If you're looking for the perfect place to identify crystals & their powers, benefits and energies you can find it in this book. I use this book as a reference book all the time."
3,Crystal Therapy,"The book isn't what I was expecting. I have other crystal books that have a lot more information in them. However, the book was brand new and the shipment was on time."
2,A really great introduction to beginners,"This is a great book for beginning to explore gridwork, angelic influence, and a basic intro to many stones. Despite the attempt, this book still mislabels several stones, and the information is very limited. Any fan of Virtue is sure to love this book, and it certainly holds a place in any serious collection. Beyond the beginner, I do not expect that many shall use this book."
5,Beloved book.,"This has always been one of my favorite stories, and I love the illustrations that accompany the text in this book. I'm very pleased with this edition."
3,Better in Hardback or Paper,"The Velveteen Rabbit is a classic in any format, but really needs to be read to the young in hardback/paper. The illustrations are fine and the story is the same, but how can you read a story about a toy becoming real on a mechanical device. Books too need to become real for children and that experience doesn't translate well for this story. I prefer my tattered, stained, paper ""Velveteen Rabbit"" which has become real through generational reads"
3,"""New"" but not so much...","The book was listed as ""new,"" but pages are crinkled from having been thumbed through many many times. I absolutely love the illustration in this particualr Velveteen Rabbit, but am disappointed the pages are not fresh and crisp as it should be in a ""new"" book."
5,Perfect,"The product works perfectly for me. Mirror is on both sides, I attached it on the driver's side using the 2 stickers contained in the box. Fit well my 2000 Saturn SL, and it's steady. Recommended."
5,If you still have misunderstandings about aids,"If you have any misunderstandings of aids, especially Pediatric Aids this is the most knowledgeable book to read and to educate yourself. From the moment in 1999 while I was watching the Essence Awards and heard Hydeia's acceptance speech for her award. I was automatically moved. I cried during her speech and I cried reading this book. I was sympathetic to her condition and was wondering what she must have went through as a child. She had a pretty good childhood and her mom was just so honorable to take on her and her little sister."
3,The concept is wonderful but the display is dim,"My son loves banging around on the calculator but I'd give my kingdom for a display that could easily be seen. For two AA batteries, you'd think you'd have large, well contrasting numbers on the display given the target audience. Instead, the numbers are dimmer than I expected and a little difficult to see. The overall construction is good and it appears the product will hold up to a fair amount of abuse."
2,These vitamins make a difference - not any more,"I'm borderline anemic and these vitamins help me to control that. I try to take these daily but either schedule or early alzheimer's gets in the way. ;) When I take them, there is definitely a noticeable difference in my mood, appetite and digestion. If, for some reason, I forget to take these before/during my period, I get very weak. Everyone has problems taking vitamins consistently. I can definitely say that when I take these, I'm a much better person.Update 09/01/11:I noticed that I would frequently get migraines after I took these vitamins. I stopped taking them for a month and although I felt some anemic weakness, the migraines did stop. I switched to a different brand and so far, so good. In addition, these vitamins get moldy at the slightest tinge of humidity, which is difficult to control."
5,70's show review,love the fact that I didn't have to buy each season seperate. I am 46 and love this show. I found the price was a steal for a new dvd collection.
2,Pad surface is small and the product evaporates too quickly,"I've used a similar product from a different manufacturer with more favorable results. In this case, the product worked to a degree but was gone before it could be effectively applied to a surface area of only a couple of inches. I won't buy it again."
1,the worst Cussler novel ever,"The prologue was bad, the next 20 pages were worse, I gave up after that."
1,What a disappointment...,"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years. I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my buy vs library list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to Iman Wilkens' hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that the book is littered with factual errors a sixth grader would spot. The characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse.At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just."
3,A Different Dirk Pitt,"I have read all of the Dirk Pitt novels and I would count this one the one that departs from the typical Cussler yarn the most. Dirk is much more introspective, soul searching, etc. The story itself I would rate as a little better than the average Dirk Pitt novel. I would recommend this as a must read for Pitt fans because of the changes that he experiences during the book. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here."
4,Loved It!!!,I absolutely loved this book. I especially love how Cussler mixes history with science and adventure. It made this book really awesome. Plus that was cool how Cussler did a little cameo appearance at the end of the book.
2,The last Dirk Pitt?????,"Perhaps the last Dirk Pitt adventure, Dirk and his friend Al go after an industrial druidic feminist cult (wow!--must have used a ""plot wheel"") that plans to change the world's weather and profit from the chaos. They are backed by the mainland Chinese. The background for all of this is the theory that the Trojan war was not about Greece or Turkey, but about the British Isles and tin mines (tin is needed to move from the copper to the bronze age). Odysseus traveled not to the Mediterranean but the Carribean. Sort of interesting and almost believable. A decent yarn, which might be Dirk's last (he is getting a little old for all that activity)and two major things change Dirk's life. Perhaps some of the future action will go to his son and daughter. BTW, the editing could have been much better. Typos and dangling modifiers all over."
4,"Solid Story, one or two mistakes","Having read all of Cussler Novels, including the ill-fated cooperation books with other authors, I believe he should stuck to Dirk Pitt.The Story itself is quite solid, tying together several mystical legends. However Cussler should stay to his characters and their story. Lorens father supposed to be dead, died as he tried to savage gear of a lost airplane (Vixen 03), how can she be walked down the aisle at her marriage with Dirk by him? Believing that Cussler has intentional introduced this mistake, like he did in several others of his novel (mixing up Dirk mother names) it could be guessed that he wants us to comment on his books.Nevertheless it is page turner! Can't stop till the last page. Friends always know when I am not returning calls or emails, that I am reading (again and again) CC books."
1,Prepubescent adventure.,"I picked up an audio version at the library as I have a long commute. After just hearing Steve Martin's hilarious ""The Pleasure of My Company"", which kept me in stitches for five lovely hours, I'm afraid I may now drive off the road asleep.It is clear that this is meant to be adult entertainment but it is so self absorbed in style. OOH, Dirk Pitt has a bunch of cars! Listen Excitedly as they drink a nice wine! Then our hero saves the day by miraculously spotting someone who planted a bomb on his ship! Everything happens so dramatically! God, I can't stand it! I'm only finishing it because I want to write an awful book myself! With the last molecule of glucose surging into my fingers, I finished the miraculous spelling of brobdingnagian! Whoopdiefrikndoo!Your pre-adolescents will love this book. Adults: Caveat Emptor."
3,A disappointing end to a really good story,"I enjoyed ""The Shunning"" immensely. I couldn't wait to read the sequels and find out what happened to Katie. The sequels provided closure to the events in the first story but failed to develop the characters further. Even more disturbing was the intimation that the Amish are not Christians; that they have need of being ""saved"". If the author meant to insinuate that she needed to find a way to back up her theology. The 3rd book is consumed with this idea and thus confuses the message. The Amish ways may be rigid, tradition driven, and unyielding. It could be argued that they are wrong on certain theological points--but not Christians? I wouldn't want to be the one to judge."
4,sniper,"I was pleasantly surprised when my generator arrived in one piece. The packaging was a little scuffed on the edges, but everything inside was in great shape.The prior reviews inspired me to be prepared before I attempted assembly so I bought a flex neck funnel before I assembled and started my new toy.Assembly was simple with the tools included with the generator, with the exception of the nuts on the wheel assembly. But that was easily solved with the 3/4"" wrench from my tool box. After everything was assembled, other accessible nuts tightened and oil and gas filled, the engine fired on the third pull. Engine runs smooth, but its a little loud. My dad's Honda is much quieter, but he paid five times as much for his generator too.I bought this to primarily power the a/c unit on my trailer and use for emergency back-up. If you're wanting something ultra quiet for use in congested campgrounds, this might not be the best generator for your needs. But this will meet my needs very nicely!"
1,"SO, SO Contraption","The TG 4000 is not for the mechanically challenged. At least the one I received. As several have noted, the front panel was slightly damaged in shipment and the pull cord is in the wrong place. The plastic cover for the electronics NEVER fit properly, yet the inspectors sticker was on the cover which clearly could never have been in place to start with; what a joke!The good first - It starts quickly, usually on the second pull and it does produce electricity. The bad - only one of the two 110 volt outlets on mine work. Taking the front panel off and comparing the provided wiring diagram to the actual wiring reveals that the second 110v outlet is wired incorrectly; absolutely wired wrong.I intend to rewire it, but thought about sending it back;- far too much trouble to return it. So,since it provides only half of the electricity that it is supposed to provide, it gets a 50% from me. As we all remember from school, a 50% grade is a FAILING GRADE."
4,ETQ Portable Generator,"Ordered Saturday night, delivered Monday. Great. Up and running now after 3 days without electricity. Handling refrigerator, fans, computers and other small items easily. Would have given it a 5 but the directions for the simple assembly were poor as were the manual pictures and the directions for starting. Biggest issue was it shipped without oil and, not surprisingly, it would not start without oil. After a frustrating 30 minutes or so of not starting, we finally realized that the missing oil was the problem. Started immediately after we filled with 10-30W oil. It should have been mentioned somewhere in the instructions that 10-30W oil was needed and that it didn't come with the generator (and you had to go out and buy your own)."
1,Fail,"I was unable to get this generator started after following very poorly written directions. I followed the steps exactly and still, no sign of life. This led to me trashing everything in my freezer/fridge, which is why I bought this generator in the first place. I found it extremely difficult to pull the starter chord. Put fresh gas and oil in the machine and checked all other levers/switches, including choke.In short, I did everything correctly to the book and yet I did not get so much as a cough out of it. Also, as a rather fit man, I could physically barely pull the starter chord. Totally unacceptable and it failed me when I needed it during last night's power outage....If I could meet a representative from this company in person I would love to share my thoughts with them and tell them how awesome it was to throw away a month's worth of frozen breast milk for my newborn....that made my wife extremely happy as I'm sure you can guess."
4,awesome,"a little too long for our surge protector, and a little too narrow to fit large plugs(they still fit, it just seems like I might be damaging the cord! My son was loving the red button that turns the whole thing off, so its great that we could get the surge protector off of the computer table, and back on the floor, but another issue we face is how to keep him from unplugging the surge protector - but thats not as bad as that bright red button that just called him to touch it LOL! This cover is very difficult to open(a good thing) not only are the latches strong, but there are more than one latch, if you're not paying attention, one latch can close while you are trying to wrench open the second latch. Ours is brand new though, don't know how its going to stand up to being opened and closed a few times!"
4,didn't do what I got it for...but ended up helping dad's dog,"I had first ordered this for my bulldog that was having some digestive issues withfrequent bowel movements. I had read during my research that sometimes adding fibercan help with this issue. Well, it didn't seem to help my dog..but later on my dad'sdog was very constipated to the point of not eating for several days. I gave himsome of this and after a couple of days she was back to her old self."
2,Hard to swallow,This stuff may do the job for some but I could not handle the taste and the consistancy. And taking it 3 times a day was just not going to happen. I gave up and will find something else.
4,is aS advertised,"simple natural product. raw psyllium. if you need psyllium fiber, which is also in metamucil and comparable generics this is fine. metamucil has coloring and sweeteners, this does not. you can get the metamucil eqivalent at walmart for less money however."
2,Psyllium disappoints,"This arrived very quickly, so service is great. However, the product did not prove helpful for me in dealing with constipation."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT,THIS PRODUCT IS AN OK PRODUCT. WHAT I LEARNED AFTER I PURCHASED IT WAS THAT PGX WAS A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT THEN THIS PRODUCT.
3,Grahamless Sly,"This is Sly's first album without the whole original Family Stone. When I first heard it, it was obvious that Graham was not pulsating the rhythm. The sound of this album was weak compare to Sly's previous albums. The songs were good for the time, but seemed like Sly was running out of ideas. The Family Stone is a product of it's parts, not just Sly. From ""Dance to the Music"" to ""Thank you for let me be myself again"" You felt the music. Fresh was a new start with a new crew, but this crew couldn't hang with the original. ""If you want me to stay"" had the sound of the original, but it was on regular octane instead high octane. I thought it was strange that a funkmeister like Sly would include an old Doris Day tune on this album. Compare to the funk releases of that year, Sly lost step with his own beat."
1,An over-priced rip-off,"Very little or no original material based on any proven or tested methods. Bluntly put, this slim book is an over-priced rip-off. The title probably more truly indicates how long the authors took writing it. Harary and Weintraub were just turning the crank on this one. Anyone looking for a reliable step-by-step guide to lucid dreaming will be much better served by Laberge and Rheingold's EXPLORING THE WORLD OF LUCID DREAMING, less expensive and much more extensive (335 vs. 128 pages), it presents both new and traditional methods of lucid dream induction, an original and scientific theory of dreaming, as well as a sweeping review of the possible applications of lucid dreaming richly illustrated with anecdotes from scores of creative dreamers. How to have lucid dreams, and what to do with them. The real thing."
4,better than I expected,"When I ordered these, I was afraid they would be too deep to eat directly out of. I have brought lunch to work in them several times now, though, and found that hasn't been an issue. They are large enough to pack a good size lunch in without being too big to fit conveniently or so big that I feel like I'm chasing the food around in a giant bowl."
5,Lolita Lempicka by LL - Perfumed Velvet Cream,"Love this after a bath, the scent just seems to be a mist on the skin and it feels like satin. So far I've found that anything from Lolita Lempicka is good.I have used too much and that's not what I need. A little goes a long way.Ordered this from Amazon and got very prompt delivery - 5 days at the most. Iwill order this again.Pat"
1,Very disappointed!,"It would play and stop, play and stop, play and stop. We never got to see the whole movie. The DVD was a big dissapointment to my 5 year old grandson. He couldn't understand why a new movie that just came in the mail would not work."
4,A must have for electronics Kits! But a little expensive,"I've bought kits like theMintyBoost 3.0 Kitand this little guy is indispensable. I was using theHelping Hand with Magnifying Glassto hold my kit at first but I was uncomfortable with the toothy alligator clips and the fact that they were metal. This holds small circuit boards very steady with safe plastic clamps which don't conduct electricity or clamp teeth on the board.I was able to use a gift card to bring this down to 10 dollars, but I don't know if I would have bought it other than that...It seems really expensive for what you're actually getting. It's helpful but there's no way it costs anything near 20 dollars to make this device.The other drawback I had with it is that you can't really swap boards in and out. You have to twist the little lever for a minute or so to readjust when you put new things in. Maybe this is true for all vices, I don't know, but it was a little time consuming."
2,No Base,I ordered this vise and like a previous reviewer stated I did not recieve the base. I sent it back for a replacement and recieved a second vise again with no base. I have given up and sent the second vise back for a refund. That's the way to inspire customer loyalty Amazon!
3,Junior is Just OK - A Little Under-Whelming,"The plastic jaws and adjustment parts don't operate as smoothly as I had expected. The description promises ""fine/coarse"" adjustment, but in reality it's just a plastic knurled knob with wings that takes a lot of turns to get the jaws open and closed. On the positive side, it has a lifetime warranty, heat resistant plastic jaws, and a nicely finished painted base. And PanaVise has an entire ecosystem of accessories. But don't expect much clamping power from the fragile jaws or holding power from the ball clamp. Just snugging up the knob on the ball clamp isn't going to hold an object motionless against working pressure. You'd have to over-tighten the plastic knobs and risk damaging the vise. This may do for soldering lightweight objects, but that's about all it would be good for. Even for that use, I will probably use the Bessey BVVB vacuum base vise that costs less and is a finely made tool that can do delicate jobs as well as more robust work."
5,The King Author's Excalibur is the perfect gift for the king in your home.,My husband enjoyed it when he opened up his sword for Christmas and we crowned him King of his new home. It really looks amazing and is a great inexpensive give.
4,Nice for the Price,"I ordered this scarf in Ocean, which is a lovely color, but other reviewers are right - the cashmere does shed a bit. I put it in the freezer overnight and that helps some, but who wants to don a cold scarf? My overall experience with Pashmina Boutique was very good and the seller is very responsive."
5,We LOVE this chair!,"I just bought my 3rd Svan Highchair for my 3rd child. This chair is great because it grows with your child. I bought one for each of my other kids and they love them. The chairs and cushions have survived rough treatment over the past 3 years and still look as good as the new set I brought home yesterday. They put the kids at the perfect height for the table - dinner, homework, art projects are all so much easier for the kids because they can scoot right up to the table and be at the right level."
1,A slim collection of re-hashed Internet e-mail anecdotes.,"I was very dissappointed with this book. For me, it was a split between re-hashed anecdoates that I've received 100 times via group e-mail and a filmography of who-almost-got-the-part in old movies I've never seen.I guess I was expecting a little more substance. My copy was only about 90 pages long (10 cents per page) and each page contained 3 or 4 little quotes. Few of these quotes seemed to represent ""big"" missteps or miscalculations and many of the subjects could not have ""known better.""I would have preferred the book focus on more important issues and explore each one further so that we can learn from the mistakes of others.Maybe it's because I'm not an ""I told you so"" kind of person, but I can't imagine who would enjoy this book."
3,"FPS are better on PC, but it's a decent game","First of all I better say i'm pretty new to PSP, and i'm not USED to playing first person shooters on console systems. So if you are used to that you may have better success with the game. Personally i'm a big fan of the series so when it came out for PSP I jumped for it. But frankly, I fought with the controls a lot more then I fought with the germans. If your used to FPS on PC I wouldn't advise getting this for PSP. It'll only be a headache.Other then that graphics are pretty decent.Sound effects, aren't as rich as the PC games, but I suppose that's to be expected.Storyline wasn't particularly spectacular either and it's very linear and scripted.I guess I was expecting better. But hey if you love the series and you enjoy FPS on PSP I'd go for it."
3,No odor control,Product came as non-irritant lotion BUT NO odor control as we had procured from other sources before!
4,what about all the failed pranks?,"Here is an informal romp through decades of MIT pranks. Reflecting well on the ingenuity and craziness of the undergrads who devoted so much time and sweat to making these happen. Most of the pranks revolve around some high tech gimmick. As you follow the narrative, you might admire the unorthodox nature to which technology has been applied.The only lack in the book is in anecdotes of failed pranks. These could surely comprise a much larger text."
2,no appetite curbing,These taste good. They do not curb my appetite and they are sooo expensive! I used them to help with sugar craving on the hcg diet. Helped with craving but Im going to try sugar free pops?
5,When sidemen rule...,"...you get an album like triangulo.The playing is stellar, the writing , as usual with michel camilo recordings "" a little sweet..."".Since I received this it has become one of my very favourites.To a large extend this is due to the rhythmsection who , In my eyes outclasses Michel, and that means something ,I think..."
3,Great book but could've had a better editor,"This book grabs you from the beginning, but there were many parts that were not needed. The editor could've done a much better job, but you fell in love w/Una and her friends and watched their lives pass you by.Una is a very powerful woman ahead of her times. You will feel compelled to call to her and help guide her. You will need tissues.If you enjoy this book pick up Pope Joan."
4,A Magical journey,"This is a BIG read-a fairytale for grownups.Adolescent Una is wisely sent to live with her mothers sister,in a lighthouse,to avoid the increasing possibility of abuse by her father,a religious fanatic. She spends four happy years with them before running away to sea,disguised as a boy,with two young men to whom she is equally attracted.This book is the story of her three marriages,the second of which is to Captain Ahab,a whaler and declared mortal enemy of Moby Dick,the great white whale. We follow Una through tragedies,joys,the loss of two husbands and a baby,to where she finally reaches true happiness and fulfillment. The book is peopled with an assortment of fascinating characters,and M/s Naslund paints incredibly beautiful and vivid word pictures of Nantucket and both the beauty and horror of living in a coastal town with all it's connections to the barbarities of the whaling trade."
2,Nothing spectacular here.,"I purchased Ahab's Wife on the recommendation of others. I regret purchasing this worthless jumble of words. These 666 pages are filled with boring reminiscences and flashbacks. By the 60th chapter, the novel has barely progressed. The ""heroine"" is reliant upon other characters in the novel. Una is a weakly constructed personality, less of a heroine and more of a dependent. The writing is calculated and boring, formulated for popular success but nothing more. This is an enjoyable yet shallow read."
1,Turgid and self-important,"Disclaimer: I didn't finish this book. I COULDN'T finish this book. It was so preposterously self-involved, so ridiculously dreary, so bloated with period-speak and crammed with philosophy, historical name dropping, heavy-handed pseudo-feminism and scientific lecturing, that I made it about a hundred pages in and gave up. A hundred pages. If a book's not going to grab me by then, it's never going to get there."
1,Test your endurance,"After reading the first chapter I was rubbing my hands together giddy with delight, and I believe you will too. This is a great author, this is great material! I could not touch the style and skill of just one of this author's paragraphs if I had a twenty years to do it. Honestly though, I eventually didn't enjoy the book as much as hoped. It's a little too feminine perhaps. As you continue it becomes obvious the book is somewhat of a soap box for ""agendas"" which wear thin and taint the prose. It was a challenge to see it through and read the whole thing."
1,Over rated Ahabs' Wife,This book might have benefited from a tough editor. It could have had at least 1/3 fewer pages. The author felt obliged to introduce every late 20th century politically correct idea into 19th century New England.
1,tries to do too much,"I read this book for my book club's next discussion. The plot idea and first chapter really drew me into the story. Then the book fell flat. The characters are not truly developed on their own, they float around as reflections of social issues. I lost interest quickly with the author attempts to comment on far too many issues in this book (slavery, liberalism, existentialism, feminism, etc.) If she had stuck with a few issues, we might have actually seen who Una really was. Although the writing itself is good, the novel is a poor attempt at modern literature. Not worth the 600 page read."
5,Beautiful Language,I can not recommend this book highly enough. The language is beautiful. I would have to re-read sentences several times because they sound so good and conjoured up such images. I have read 3 novels since this one and while their content is ok I am bored by their style - their lack of creativity and imagery.
5,A literary tour-de-force!,"An exemplar of that rare-breed, the literary page-turner. One gets the sense that the author put everything she knows, has lived and experienced--and all that she is--into this book. ""Ahab's Wife"" is both old-fashioned and modern, and it stands--proudly and boldly--alongside Melville's masterpiece. A literary tour-de-force!"
2,Unimpressed,"Very little research was done on this novel. The protagonist, Una, acts like a time-traveler from the present, and is completely out of place in this book. She also manages to meet nearly every real-life, famous literary figure from the late 1800s in the course of her travels. Pure fantasty, not anything like a historical novel. The writting style was also difficult to get into, and POV shifts were irritating."
2,based on a true story,"I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, ""The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex"" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events. I suggest that readers of ""Ahab's Wife"" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read. Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves. I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts. In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish."
4,A great story on relationships,"To highlight one small aspect of this novel, the author does a wonderful job of portraying many positive relationships throughout the course of the novel.Although there are some relationships in the novel that have conflicts, the depiction of mother / daughter, father ""figure"" / daughter, female friendships, business partnerships, teacher / student, boss / employee, and husband / wife (or partner / partner) are generally strong, open, and powerful.Throughout the book, the compassion and devotion the character exhibits within these relationships is at times to a fault, but is generally something to be admired.Granted, this is a small component to a book with many facets. However, I found that this relationship theme was fascinating and added tremendous depth to each of the characters."
5,Ahab's Wife is a work of art.,"Ahab's Wife is a work of art with characters who emcompass the full spectrum of good and evil. While Ahab looks outward and to Moby Dick to find his truth, Una searches inward for her truth and finds a spirituality worthy of our time. Una's journey to self is genuine and spontanteous, surprising and familiar. The story is rich in details (historical and fictional) which hand you a vibrant, authentic world."
4,Ahab's Wife,Everyone says it's a good book but so far I haven't gotten into it real well. That's not your fault.
2,Ahab's Wife,"It was said to be ""new"" and it was definitely not new...the pages were warped looking.I wanted to give it to my mother for Mother's Day but had to go buy a NEW one at Hastings. I was disappointed. If I had ordered ""used"" I wouldn't have minded because I would have been buying for myself but when it's stated ""new"" I expected more."
2,Why Do We Support These Types Of Books?,"I just don't understand this. Ahab's wife? What? And she's been married before and since? Wow. That certainly degenerates our classic obsessor even more. What is with all these books trying to spin off other things that were better. Dune: House of Atreides? Doctor Who: Interference? Casablanca: As Time Goes By? Young Indiana Jones: Treasure of the Peacock's Eye? What's wrong with keeping the integrity of the originals by not taking revisionist approaches to that which inspired you. Why does everything need ""Further"" and ""Missing"" adventures. To make a buck? This was Moby Dick. Where will this madness end?!!"
2,Just not the same,"I became a fan of W. E. B. Griffin in 1994 when I read the first book in the Corps series. I was hooked and subsequently read all of his offerings that were in print, and eagerly awaited his new releases that generally came out once a year. I have noticed a substantial change in Mr. Griffin's books in recent years. They still have the detailed description of characters, equipment and military policy of his past works, but there is little plot and the recent releases certainly are not ""page turners"". If you expect this edition to rival his earlier efforts you will be disappointed."
2,Go Back to WWII!,"I have read everything in the Corps series and loved the first few. Griffin came up with a unique style that educates the reader on the details of military life through the stories of a number of interesting and heroic characters with comic relief provided by an occasional cowardly and/or incompetant martinet. Griffin should go back to WWII where there is much left to be told. The Korea books are not up to standard and make the personalities of the heroes redundant, boring, ridiculous, and parodies of themselves. Has anybody ever considered the similarities of Griffin's books to Star Trek? The main characters never die, just the ones new to the current episode! Or are they like Buck Rogers in which the hero goes off on harrowing missions every week and ends up back at headquarters lauded as the conquering hero once again? The funniest thing of all is that Griffin still has me hooked and I will buy the next installment (in paperback, of course)!"
4,cross creek,The book was written in 1942. A good description of life in rural undeveloped Florida. She loves her life in the orange groveand writes about it with a good sense of humour.
5,Given as a gift,"I plan on purchasing my own soon, and I'm certain this is an incredible read. I loved the movie and ""of course"" the book is ALWAYS better right??"
3,It's nice but...,"If you're looking for a coaching book, this is very good, but there are better. For instance - any title by Joe Luxbacher."
4,Good episode,"Fun episode with several heartwarming story arcs. There is a 2-3 minute weird Jenny dream sequence which can be easily fast-forwarded through. Actually, it would be great if someone did a re-edit where all the Jenny dream sequences are edited out of the show. I'm pretty sure the show would be better as a result.Worth a watch!"
4,The best series ever!,"I loved this the second season of this groundbreaking show... I found myself laughing, crying and gasping with shock all in the same episode!! The only slightly negative aspect of this 4-DVD set is that the special features are pretty short... I would love to have seen a gag reel, some behind-the-scenes stuff and longer interviews with the cast (especially Jennifer Beals!!) However, the L-word Balderdash feature is hilarious!!Overall, great value for money!"
5,A great resource book,"We have been using this text in our Texas Public School Law class in a chort of SFA in Mabank, and it has proven to be a wonderful resource book, sparking interesting discussion and debate."
1,Outward Hound Booster Seat,I recently bought two of these for my two shih tzus. I returned them right away. They were much too cumbersome to use and the seat was too shallow. They're cute but not well constructed for the purpose intended.
1,The horror... the horror...,"Okay, I admit I have not purchased this item... but seriously, take a look at that picture! These 'decorations' are hideous looking. I think I know which one is meant to be Ringo, but I honestly have no idea about the others. I'm pretty sure no one will ever buy this, so my review is irrelevant. I just find this item to be deeply disturbing and I really wish I would never have stumbled upon it."
3,A Melancholy Refrain,"Young Roddenberry's constant refrain about not knowing anything about his father's seminal work eventually creates a tone of petty self-absorption and manipulating for sympathy; the viewer can see the hurt with which Mr. Roddenberry has yet to come to terms. Hopefully, this movie journey has helped.Lots of familiar content for the trekkie is included here, plus a few new bits of material (like the clips from one of the first Trek conventions). The interview with George Lucas was awkward.But, of course, it is always pleasant to revisit the cast and rewatch classic clips from TOS."
1,bad book,"Samples of badly sewed footwear are given. One star - for quality of printing house, for the rest work awful. I very much am upset because of the money spent in vain. It not handmade, is hack-work. I do not advise to buy."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I LOVE ""Goodnight Kisses"" by the same author. This left me disappointed with the cheap mirror at the end of the book. But, hey, it's a baby book and my baby seems to like it just fine."
5,Concise and clear,"The best description of this commentary on Daniel is -I think- the one offered to the author himself by one of the elders of his church: ""Instead of going into all the minuted details of these profecies the way some do ... you've tried to extract the main principles and apply them to our lives now.""I thank the author for the clarity of his exposition, his humility when -sometimes- announcing that his interpratation may be wrong, and his bringing the text to our modern lives. As for the events announced and that have been fulfilled, this is a good survey; as for those events that are yet to be fulfilled the author does not speculate but sets clear demarcation marks between the former and the latter.I also appreciated this book for the concise and clear way that historical facts were presented as the chapters in this prophetic book of Daniel progressed."
4,A quick summary of Daniel,"If you are looking for a clear concise analysis of Daniel, then this is the book for you. It is a good book and he gives you direct interpretations. To this extent I was a little disappointed for I have heard and read some of his other material and he gave quite extensive details and explanations. My wife and I are studying Daniel, Olivet Discourse and Revelation over the last few years, so I purchased this book and Walvoord's Daniel Commentary to help us more thououghly understand. Both books are are good but Walvoord, is way more detailed, giving conservative and liberal understanding with his final summation."
5,Just what I was looking for.,This book was recommended to me for my church's study in Daniel. What an incredible resource! Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to dig quite deeply into Scripture.
5,A terrific collection of witty essays assured to please.,"My mother became an enthusiastic Frances Weaver fan after she attended a lecture several years ago. She was thrilled with this collection of Weaver's witty essays and antidotes and I was pleased I bought it for her. Since reading There's More To Me Than I've Used Yet, my mother has taken on the world and approached life with a renewed since of excitement."
2,"Good, but needs some updates","I was handed the text to pickup teaching an existing Java class. The book does a good job helping a student get going early with objects and graphics, and has good setup instructions for the four Java IDEs suggested. It was impressed by the step-by-step instructions to ""dumb-down"" JBuilder5 (provided on CD) for use by students new to Java.Unfortunately, JBuilder5 is quite outdated, and the free version doesn't like the newer JDKs. But the main issue I have with the book is the use of AWT for graphics examples. Other books of even earlier vintages converted to Swing, but not this one.Hope there's an update soon!"
2,Outdated,"The book is outdated at 7 years old. Even the book itself thinks this book is outdated because it says that Java is a language that gets updated often.It also bothered me that it didn't use the free Sun provided Netbeans IDE. It doesn't even mention it, yet it was available two years prior to the copyright of this book.Finally, I'll admit that the book doesn't do a bad job at teaching the material it does have. However, sometimes I find myself reading the most cumbersome paragraph and wonder who wrote this book. For instance, I can't understand what it wants me to accomplish in the Case Study on page 189. It makes no sense."
1,Boring boring boring,"I was expecting this book to be an extension of Ireland's book, ""Life Wish"" and it wasn't. This book is all about her adopted son's drug addiction and her father's stroke. Not interesting at all. What a disappointment !!!"
4,Innovative,"A beautiful sample of peyote, sure to give any beader artist values to explore and invent. This book is a real motivator to push your own interpretations."
3,"Standard Higgins, but MacNee AWFUL!","If you've ever heard a great professional reader like Frank Miller or David Case, you'll know why I can't stand it when authors or actors narrate a book. Patrick MacNee has no feel and his accents are atrocious. His idea of an Italian accent is to add an 'a' to the end of every word. Just awful!"
1,"Oh, My!","Screwcaps on wine bottles - actually not invented until about the late 1960s, I think. But that (and a lot of other weird stuff) pales when you compare it to Sara, the secretary of the Führer.A snowball in hell would have had a lengthy life compared to a Sara in Hitler's bunker; bear in mind that one of the most dignity-killing acts under the German Racial Laws was that every Jew had to use a Jewish first name -- Sara was one of those names, as was Moses for men.A little research by the author would have shown that Hitler, at that stage in life, was a foaming-at-the-mouth paranoiac (maybe for good reasons), and his gentle conversation with the ""SS pilot"" who renders a forbidden salute to the Supreme Commander of the Reich's military....well, what can I say!Oy, Gevalt, mein Führer!"
2,The Vicar of Bullhampton (Illustrated),"Trollope worked hard, escaping the memories of povertyby producing such; this is only 1 volume of The Chroniclesof Barset. Read The Warden first to introduce2 characters, crucial to Chronicles, Mr. Harding and ArchdeaconGrantly. Insights into Trollope's family woven into Chronicles creation."
1,"terrible, archaic translation","I am a third of the way into the book and I am giving up. This horrible translation is ridiculously archaic. Does the modern reader really need this many thou's, thee's, shalt's?? No, the modern reader does not. If anything, the language used makes it even harder to process and internalize the otherwise useful and insightful journal entries of Marcus Aurelius."
4,A Glimpse into Roman Philosophy,"Marcus Aurelius' ""Meditations"" is a celebrated work composed by one of Imperial Rome's most celebrated leaders. While at times a bit challenging to get through, the most impressive quality of the work is its classic endurance. Partly a collection of life-lessons and partly a discourse on the psychology of mankind and government, Meditations is as insightful today as it was in ancient Rome. Overall, an impressive intellectual piece and a good edition to any well-stocked private library."
3,An oldie but a goodie,"Thirty years ago i read this little book, and even memorized some of the meditations. The only flaw is that stoicism represses feelings, which is why Marcus Aurelius was reported to have had constant migrain headaches. The rest of it is pure Zen, except where he writes to ""Let no emotions of the flesh effect the supreme and sovereign portion of the soul"""
1,NOT THE EDITION PROMISED IN THE AMAZON REVIEW SUMMARY,"This is NOT the Hays 2002 translation and edition. The mistake is Amazon's, evidently, not the booksellers': the Amazon summary refers to the Hays 2002 translation, although the image is different. Amazon and the booksellers need to clear this up!"
3,Love the series but this one missed the mark.,"I have been an avid Deathlands reader for many years and for James Axler to go out this way for his last book was a bit typical deathlands read. I liked the story o.k, but you would think the writer would go out with a bang - instead he seemed to slink away quietly. Too bad from someone who brought this series to the top of post-holocaust reading. Ryan and the group are just too darn trusting which in this world - will get you killed! How come they just eat or drink anything that the bad guys give them? Come on Mr. James, you know you want to come back and give us a superb adventure story sometime. Never say never!"
3,Average,"Well, as the last book to be written by Laurence James for the series that he brought to life, it wasn't all that spectacular. I hate to say it, but it was filled with all the typical cleches that we have grown used to. Example. The baron that had a history with Ryan and the others, wanted to kill them but ends up forgiving them. Another ville where they are forced to participate in 'tests'. If they pass, they become members of the community, if they fail, they die. Of course we nearly lost one of the characters and when Ryan went for his nightly relief in the woods he was attacked. There were a few suprises though that made up for the usual. The biggest was the meal that they ended up sharing. That suprised me more than you can imagine. Overall the book was average. A real shame. I was hoping for something really spectacular."
5,It is a Paradiso,I have not seen A better classic concert. The atmosphere is unique. Themes are part of the greatest movies and everyone's life.Morricone is a master...there is no need for more reviews.
1,Do NOT waste your money,I bought this at babies r us. It did not fit my rail. It says it fits most standard rails but doesn't give any measurements. How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it? What a pain.
1,Crib rails,"The product itself was okay. Our crib rails were wider so we returned them for the cloth kind. Even if this set would have fit, not sure I would have used it. Great for functionality but looks like something you'd find in a place like a daycare--not cozy."
2,Didn't Work,Was hoping this would be the right product for our crib - (after the Gummi crib protector failed to work).This product seems to only work if your crib is exactly the correct size as there is little flexibility with fit.
1,Straight into the garbage,"I have a fairly common Graco crib, and these rail things don't quite fit. They pull off at the slightest tug. In fact, my toddler was injured when he tried to pull himself up on the crib rail to see his baby brother. The crib rail protector came right off in his hand and he slipped, knocking his face against the side of the crib. Forget it. It's safer to just let the baby chew on the rail."
2,"Might Work, Might Not","The tops of my son's crib rails are rounded over. The Crib Rail Teether slides on easily enough, but doesn't snap into place. My son (12 months) pulled it off in less than a week. After he pulled one portion off, he fell back down onto the crib mattress, jabbing the end of the crib rail teether into the bottom of his chin causing a gash, but not serious thankfully. Please check to see that your child cannot easily remove the teether strips. If he can, an accident like this can easily happen. If the strips stayed in place, they would have been fine. However, each crib is different, so check first to see that the strips are a good ""fit""."
1,Not childproof,"It was great for about 2 weeks. Then, my 10 month old figured out how to pull them off. I gave up on using them."
1,Not Satisfied,I BOUGHT THE ITEM ON THE 3RD OF MAY AND THE PUMP STOPPED WORKING BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY. I HAVE TO RETURN THE ITEM.
1,Okay --- Keep Searching!!!,"Pastor Smith, in his book Raising Up Young Heroes, writes common sense and practical and restates what has already been said. Raising Up Young Heroes is okay. The book takes a holistic approach to youth ministry, in an attempt to change the student from the inside out. This book will NOT really help you better minister to a culture that is ever changing. He tells you what to do, but now how to do it. Keep searching for something more concrete and useful. Save you money."
3,"Nice, but not very sturdy","This wood basket sits nicely next to my fireplace. But don't expect this to be able to hold more than 3-4 good sized logs. Also, the nuts and bolts seem to come loose for no reason (since it doesn't get moved around). All in all, this looks nice and will well work for someone who is looking more for a decorative piece."
1,not worth the money,"this book doesn't cover any theoretical aspect of credit scoring. for example, almost every authoer is still using K-S statistics, which is no better than just eye-balling the difference between any 2 curves. the book provides no useful information to someone who wants to learn how to do the scoring. this book has 1/3 of overlap with the editor's last book. are the editor and authors just lazy? or the articles are just too good?"
2,Rather disappointed,"I normally LOVE Zyliss products, so purchasing this cheese grater seemed like a no-brainer.Wrong.As others have noted, the handle is far too short to make the grater work as effectively as it could. And the handle-hold is plain ergonomically weird.The Mouli cheese grater (a French production) is hands down superior to this style. I had a contemporary, plastic version of it for YEARS before it gave out.This Zyliss grater also lacks 'grip' on the under side of the press, so the cheese slides forward and wedges in place in a way that leaves large pieces ungrated.Overall, would NOT buy this again, though I'll figure out how to make it more happy for me to use...hopefully."
3,"Works great, doesn't last long","I had no problems with using it, but the plastic just doesn't hold up in the long-term. The spinning part of the handle that you hold was starting to come off if you applied any pressure in the ""pulling it off"" direction (not that I'd ever tried to take it off before), and finally the handle snapped off of the drum from all the times of pushing it back to lock into place. Wish I could order a 5-pack of replacement drums, because it beats hand grating zucchini and parmesan!"
3,Cheese grater review,"Although it was exactly what I ordered, I had to give it awayI have arthritis in my hands and thought it was more like an electric one where you just put the cheese in and it goes. I would never have been able to turn the handle to get the cheese goingI sent it to my grandaughter and she loves it and says they grate cheese every day"
4,"works great, easy clean-up","works just as advertised. easy system of changing drums. easy to clean. unless it breaks, I've got no complaints."
3,Not the holy grail of cheese graters,"Lipstick on a pig comes to mind rating this product. A nice design but poor functionality. Let's compare this with an old aluminum hand cheese grater many of us are familiar with:- Both grate cheese: Old grates more fine like you would expect grated cheese to be. All Zyliss drums shred the product.- Both use hand pressure: Old is flimsy but more forgiving of cheese chunk size. Zyliss is less forgiving. Old seems easier to apply pressure.- Both have a hinge: Old is permanent, Zyliss comes free and could get lost in dishwasher.Other than easier cleaning for the Zyliss, if you don't count the worry of the hinge piece getting lost, I see no discernable advantage other than better looks"
2,Poor Choice for Soft Cheese,"I won't keep this cheese grater. I have been looking for a grater for soft cheese. This is uncomfortable to use and makes a mess. I think a smaller size is better if you can find one well made.I am disappointed in this product and would not recommend it for soft cheese. Also, for hard cheese there are much better choices such as the OXOOxo Good Grips Seal and Store Rotary Grater, White"
5,Love it!,"I had been looking for a cheese grater that would be easier to use than the typical ones. After reading some of the reviews on here, I wasn't sure if I should actually purchase it. But I went ahead and got it, and I am so glad I did! Many of the complaints are that the handle isn't long enough. I can see how if it were longer, it might be a bit easier, but I really haven't found it to be a problem. I could just have small hands though. It grates cheese quickly and easily. It cleans super easy too. I just put it in the dishwasher and it gets completely clean!"
4,The slog through misprints is worth the effort.,Beautiful book especially if you love nature. A glimpse of the West in the later 1800's from the eyes of a New Englander. Worth having to contend with all the typos (only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars.)
2,Microfiber Camisole by Cinema Etoile,"Disappointed. Had purchased other items of theirs, and was not thrilled with this fabric: to shiny."
5,meets expectations,I am very pleased with the Gingher pinking shears purchased from Amazon. I purchased another brand from a local store just because THEY were available immediately and I had a coupon. The Gingher ones are sooo much better.
2,EHH,"These scissors look really cool. They even come in a cool little tin. But they are super heavy, they hurt your fingers when your trying to cut something thats a little tough, and they dont cut through tough materials very well (fabric swatches with paper attached to the back for example) it shouldnt be that hard for it to cut."
4,Somewhat EZ to Install,"Much cheaper than buying at a dealership or auto store. Was somewhat ez to install, except for inserting it into the harness without breaking the bulb. Been a few months & still working great!"
3,A solid foundation for discipline.,"Dr. Dobson's main concept - that parents need to be in charge of their children - is right on. If more parents did this we would have less violence and disturbing behavior from our country's children. However, he can be a bit tough, so you have to temper his advice with your own common sense. I'd also recommend: Kid Cooperation (How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading) by Elizabeth Pantley"
4,wonderful,I am expecting my second child and I think that this item is wonderful. Because for my first child no matter how much I cleaned her dresser I still managed to get wooden pieces on her clothing. I really hated this so I had to wash her drawers every time I had to put clean clothes in her dresser. This was an great idea and the pattern is very adorable. Not to mention it is a neutral color for either a boy or girl. I can just imagine my new babys clothing smelling like they were just washed straight out of the dresser drawer. I would never have to worry about wood fibers from the drawer getting into my babys clothing never again. Thanks for this wonderful and unique creation.
1,dont like it,I rely didnt like the way it was made i mean when you make anime you could have any camea angle in the world but this has alot of still pics and it could be beter
1,Not to the point,"This book will explain how the rules were created and turned to what they are today. Who cares how they came to be, the only important thing is what you can and cannot do under the circumstances. It will explain what to consider, in general terms, when valuing distressed companies. But what discount rate should you use? How would you value different assets? It doesn't explain. There are no numbers in this book. It's not practical. It's like buying a cooking book and when you want to know how to make a cake the book reads: ""use eggs, milk, flower and mix"". Ok, thanks."
3,A fun read,"Even though Ms. Greenwood shifts her story between countries and decades, she never loses track of the murders, the characters, and the plot. Intelligent and fun!"
3,"Entertaining, but a little light","I enjoyed the book, but one does have to willfully suspend disbelief. Things are just a little to easy for Phryne which destroys any suspense. Do not plan to read any more in the series."
5,King's political horror story,"The lead character of ""The Dead Zone,"" the tragic hero Johnny Smith, is one of the most memorable that King ever created. This is not a pure horror story, it reads more like the anti-""Its a Wonderful Life."" Smith has a near fatal accident, spends years in a coma an awakes with the ability to see the future (or at least, the bad things). He becomes convinced that a rising politician will one day set off global armageddon and tracks him across a mid-1970s landscape which even brings him into contact with a startled dark horse Presidential candidate named Jimmy Carter. Even though it may lack the gutteral horrors of some of his other novels, this is still one of King's best."
5,"Low men, high moments","Hearts in Atlantis was an endearing nostalgic book, a pleasure to read. It had frightening moments and nightmarish situations but there was a change in Mr. King's writing style. It would be difficult to explain this subtle change. Nevertheless, it is there and personally, all his fans will feel privileged if this change becomes part of his permanent style of writing."
1,Horrible edition of the book,"You do not want to buy this edition of the book. It's teeny tiny and looks like the hard cover books that the whole class would get back in middle school. The words disappear into the spine of the book. Check the dimensions for whatever edition you buy, and get something that's normal size."
5,One of the best books ever written,"I admit that the book kinda started out slowly, but when it got going it was full steam a head. Congradulations to Stephen King on another find piece of work."
3,Easy reading,"It is easy reading, plot simple, a bit drawn-out, however, I enjoyed it as I like the author's style and Scotland."
5,Another View,"'AnotherView 'love all her books ,just her style of writing you can lose yourself in the story only problem ,it was not long enough"
1,I never thought I would say this about a Pilcher's book....very very boring!,"Sorry Mrs. Pilcher but your muse of inspiration left you while you wrote this book, about a girl who couldn't get on with her life but to wait on everyone else. Totally boring, do no waste your money. I just started ""under gemini"" and so far it has not click in yet, kind of slow but it may change. I will write about it too."
4,"Engaging, funny, light-hearted, good local color","Nick Fashon, the young, handsome and charmingly vain co-owner of a clothing store called Love & Fashion, with his partner, Vince Love, finds himself sole heir to the estate of his barely-known grandfather, a desert rat whose invention, the doohickey of the title, may possibly be a money-maker. This drives a plot with wacky, funny, wise-cracking characters like an ambitious Latina TV cooking show hostess, an archaeologist girl-friend, a hick lawyer who is a wannabe dude, all in a mildly twisted mystery plot.There is an awful lot of talk about mouth-watering food in the book and you'll find yourself inexplicably hungry throughout, hankering for menudo or huevos rancheros washed down with margaritas grandes. And you'll enjoy the well-described Tucson scene.Not in the same league as mysterydom's big-hitters, but worth an evening's read nonetheless.Scott Morrison"
1,rediculous,"This book is disrespectful to the culture, environment and residents of Maui on very many levels. Why does everyone who comes here have to take and never give...look for opportunities like this [...] if your coming to Maui, leave something better behind you, or don't come at all."
5,Great book,Wanted to know what to cram into our schedule for a week to make the most of our 6 day visit. This book (although an older edition) had all the suggestions. For the adventurous (the non-resort hotel type) put this in your backpack.
2,Snorkeling,"I read every guidebook I can get my hands on before I go on vacation. Of the pile I took along, this was the worst for snorkeling. My main problem with this book is its tone. It was trying to be too authoritative on every topic. Snorkeling experts they are not. There is a much better book out for snorkeling called SNORKELING MAUI by Malewowski. The maps are much clearer, there are far more places to snorkel and it is much better written."
4,Great idea for dutch oven tote!,I was very please with this Lodge Camp dutch oven tote! It make transport of this item very easy & secure.
1,Pointless!,"As others have said and I agree this movie has a lot of quailty issues for sure. However I could have overlooked a lot of that including some questionable not to mention cheesy content, IF it had had a decent ending. It just seemed so pointless, to have him lose the woman and then he gives up the kid and his ranch on his own anyway. She gives him up to save him and then he gives everything up anyway. What point did that serve? I can deal with a hard realistic ending If it serves a purpose, But this ending just didn't make sense to me."
2,Beware of Old VHS tapes:,"If you are ordering a VHS tape video, try to make sure that it is 100% playable...time and heat are enemies of VHS tapes. They stick together and loose the sound track or more..This happened to me on this last purchase of ""Valdez's Horses""....Mostly unplayable."
2,Not enough plot...,"I enjoyed THE LONG RAIN, and decided to read Gadol's earlier novel. While the concept of the story is interesting, it is ultimately unsatisfying. There is too much description of ""woods"" and house-building techniques and not enough plot.I don't feel as though I ever got a handle on Helen.Though THE LONG RAIN is flawed by too much description (this time it's wine-making), the story and characters are better-developed."
3,"These guys have unbelievable chops, but it'd be nice if you could hear them....","Kenso is a band out of Nippon Japan, led by a guitarist who is also an M.D. Starting with the first track 'Kojinteki Kikyu', the band takes off into a blazing instrumental, showing that they can hold their own with prog-metal stalwarts Dream Theater and Rush. The rest of the CD is mellow songs mixed with hard rocking fusion. Unfortuinately, most of the instruments are hard to tell apart on this CD, as the sound mix is mediocre at best. The songs sound like someone put a microphone in the middle of the room with no regard for what instrument was soloing at the present time. Hopefully, in the future, someone will remaster this CD so you can get the best out of it. Until then, buy only if you're a Kenso completist."
4,Great book,"Such a great book! I got this because I liked the description and when I needed a break from the deep, loaded books, I picked this one up and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the typical girl falls in love with guy story, but it was well beyond that. Enough twists and unexpected surprises that kept me shocked many times throughout the book. I really thought I'd always know where the book was going, but many times I sat here thinking, ""Man, I didn't see that coming!"" I also enjoyed the writing stye and laughed many times through.My only complaint is that the editor wasn't very good. There are so many grammatical and spelling errors, even words missing (small things that probably no one else would pick up normally). And the author has a tendency to use the exact same phrases over and over again when describing things, so I'd be thinking, ""Didn't she just say that exact same thing?"" and indeed, she would have.This was my first Elizabeth Young book, but I plan to read others."
2,This was not for me.,"Of all the books I have read in the past year this was by far the most stupid of them all. It is based upon a lie in which gets everything spiraling out of control. This books is not like the Brigdeet Jones or Becky Bloomwoods. It is just not great, actually it is not even good."
2,"Not Anywhere Close to Film,""The Wedding Date"".","Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney were ""Kat"" and ""Nick"".Yes,Duplicitous Is a great word to describe Why ""Kat"" in the film did what she believed forced to Follow through.By not keeping the same names as the characters in book and tweeking readers into ""false"" feelings of the same book to film is not my cup o' tea.The film,based on this book is a ""bit o' crack"".{Fun for those not knowing the British slang}.Film is witty,a great Supporting Cast w/Holland Taylor,Amy Adams and a slew of British Actresses&Actors many will recognise and Delight in trying to recall where they were seen and what Film{s}.Glad I read review prior to purchase of Book.Film is a more even easy to follow Reasoning of Events.Top Notch and Own the Film..."
1,The wedding date,"Saw the film The wedding date, which I greatly enjoyed, especially Dermot Mulroney, and was anxious to buy book film was based on i.e. Asking for Trouble. Found the book a load of rubbish with very little to do with the film."
2,British Jargon,"I picked up this book thinking it would be a light, easy, enjoyable read. I have to admit at times it was all of those things, but other times this book was quite annoying. The author often uses British jargon and random sorts of acronyms such as ""STM"" that I found extremely annoying and completely random. I was never a fan of the whole ""Bridget Jones"" thing and maybe that's why all of these reviewers who liked Bridget Jones also liked this book. I will admit that overall, the story was kind of cute, but I really wouldn't have minded if it was about 150 pages shorter. Furthermore, I have read many incredible books and by NO MEANS would I rate this book 4 1/2 stars on average. I guess that you have to take it for what it's worth, which is a light-hearted read, but also keep in mind that at times, the main character seemed somewhat pathetic to me and unlike other readers of this book, I could not wait for it to end so I could start something better."
3,This plot is as overused as the title,"I read this book because it was recommended by a book cataloge that I highly respect, but now I wonder if they even bothered to read it themselves. The main character annoyed me from start to finish, the ""love interest"" seemed anything but interested, and the plot was just a drawn out version of a million sit-com and romantic comedy story-lines. I found myself skipping whole pages toward the end, just to get through Sophy's uptight, self loathing rants and boring repetition.The book was mildly funny, and I enjoyed the British Colour (although I must admit to not understanding half of it), thus the three stars. I would recommend it as a light beach read."
3,So So,"I admit it. I am addicted to romantic comedies, even when they let me down, like this one did. There is nothing wrong with Asking For Trouble, but there is nothing that distinguishes it either, save for the rather unique story. Instead of your generic girl meets boy and is interested in him, etc. story, Asking For Trouble offers the girl hires boy to act as boyfriend, etc. storyline. The humor is at best mildly amusing--there is nothing in here that is going to make you laugh out loud. Additionally, Sophy, the protagonist who hires Josh to impersonate her nonexistant boyfriend for a family wedding, is pretty annoying. She lies constantly and that behavior was frustrating to read about. Asking For Trouble is not, however, a bad novel. Elizabeth Young writes well and the story hangs together. There is just nothing terrific about it."
3,movie was better!,"Although the book had its charming moments, it was too long. As I read I felt an increasing sense of dread about what Sophy was doing. It was almost painful to watch her lie constantly while digging herself an even bigger grave. Like I said, it did have its fun moments, but if you were impressed by the movie, I wouldn't ruin that feeling by reading the book. If you read the book before seeing the movie, you might be more impressed than I was, but overall I found it bland and very unbelievable. Watch the movie- it's a bit more understandable and a much better version!"
5,The Jeweller's Shop,"This film has an excellent cast of Burt Lancaster, Olivia Hussey and Ben Cross.It is a touching and lovely movie, while still portraying the sorrows and challenges in married life.This film is one of the best and truest films on the subject of Real Love!I woud recommend this for anyone."
3,Bible Commentary,I found the book useful but biased with a certain social agenda promoting popular earthly interpretations rather than biblical exegesis.
5,Only the title is long-sentences are normal,"Author Mary Hershey is on great trip and generous enough to take all of us along. Her fantastic character development is a sure-fire cure for anyone afflicted with siblings, no matter what their age. Follow her formidable plot development through real moral dilemmas in a twist and turn mystery that sets up an addiction to sequels. Read with caution-you will need to buy the series before it is all over."
3,Not what I thought it would be...,It really isn't any more information than you could get it you just made a little effort yourself on the internet. I had expected some new ideas or better results than what I got.
4,great shoe,"this shoe is just the right color and fits wellthey were made in brazil, but now of course made in china"
4,Great shoe,"I really like this shoe, especially since it comes in a wide width which is difficult to find in a quality shoe. They are very comfortable and stylish. Only suggestion that would make it more comfortable for me would be to have a less pointed toe."
2,NOT LEATHER SHOES UGH!,I liked the styling of the shoe but it said that they were leather and they werent so I was very disappointed
