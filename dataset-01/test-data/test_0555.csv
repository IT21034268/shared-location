5,Ed Murrow,"I have the complete Ed Murrow collection, and I must say this portrays him and his fight with McCarthy very well, the good thing is it cut McCarthy,s venomous speech against Murrow to the nitty-gritty, making it more understandable, without the rambling that went on and on. I know I will watch it more than once."
4,More Hollywood Rewriting of History,"Although this movie was entertaining, it is a completely slanted version of history. America is in the dire condition it is in today because the media trashed, slandered and libeled the great Senator Joseph McCarthy and got away with it.America is in the grip of global organized crime based on zionist philosophy and centered in Israel. If senator McCarthy had been able to rid the gov't of treasonous zionist criminals, the Kennedy's would never have been assassinated, and many atrocities like the Iraq war would not have become reality."
3,Yet another iteration of liberalism's passion play,"I'm so tired of Hollywood rehashing the McCarthy era. Most recently it was ""The Majestic""; before that, ""The Contender""; before that, ""The Crucible,"" and before *that*, ""Guilty By Suspicion."" Give us a break. The only thing that redeems this movie is great acting, skinny ties and chain smoking. Those guys in the 50s knew how to dress and they knew how to enjoy life."
3,Just a few speech,"This movie contains very little stuff except some good speech. Most of the events in the movie are added to expand the length of the movie to about 90 minutes, without any significance or relation with each other. It must have cost very little to make this movie; it does not even use color film."
1,Revisionist History,This movie is a one-sided attempt to rewrite history. It does not even mention the VERONA documents that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that McCarthy was correct in his assertions.Good Night and Good Luck is not interested in the truth. Clooney tells a twisted falsified tale to once again demean a man that died 50 years ago as if his name weren't already tarnished.If you are interested in reading a factual biography of McCarthy please see http://www.senatormccarthy.com. Please do not rely on this movie as a historical source because it fails in that department miserably.
5,B2B - The revolution continues,"Cunningham has captured the essence of the B2B marketplace and built a tremendous guide for those planning ""do something about it"". Obviously based on real world situations, the book will be useful for those trying to figure out where to make their next move, with an excellent roadmap with prescriptive milestones and waypoints. As B2B includes business process improvements and the new destinations emerging in the market, there is something here for start-ups, brick and mortars and interested bystanders. Impressive and very consumable."
2,"Carried the theme, but would rather not have read","For me, this was the worst book of the series. Though you cannot skip it if you are hooked, I don't know why the author did not just add the important pieces to books 2 and 4 and skipped the third book. I felt it meandered along and that the characters became too muddled.As another reviewer indicated, having the character Noah/Caela/Cornelia fall in love with someone who has mistreated her for centuries is a bit of a stretch. The author's storytelling is complex, but after 2 books of extreme behavior by characters, it is a tough sell to get us to forgive all. I moved on to the 4th book only because I was committed and wanted a conclusion, not because of a great love for these role-changing characters."
5,The Kayakers' Friend,"These are the binoculars I carry when I kayak, canoe, or raft. They've been in and under water in the far North Pacific, the Atlantic, the fjords of Southern Chile, Lakes Superior, Ontario, Kabetogama, Yellowstone, and a lot of smaller ones, as well as deep under the Green River and the Colorado River. They're still completely functional. Good optics, good feel in the hand. If you have any interest in bird-watching from a boat, these are what you need. And the price is decent. One word of advice, based on experience; stick to Nikon, Canon, and Celestron, and avoid Bushnell like the plague."
1,will not stand up,"i've purchased these 3 times...and each time the eye pieceseither come apart or fall off, or will not adjust anymore.these are nice binoculars but will not hold up with usemore than 1 year."
1,Not Advantagous,This item was used by my father and was found to be useless. It didn't help him get in nor out of the car.
4,A Good Read,"I really don't agree with the Publisher's Weekly review. This book is certainly not as good as most of Alternative's output, but it is a solid read. I have a review up at www.brokenfrontier.com for further explanation."
4,Good,"I thought Zoe Jakes did a great job with this dvd. Even though there are a few times where it gets a bit confusing; she's very informative with the material. It's a great dvd, some may disagree due to editing but I honestly didn't find anything wrong with it. It's a great dvd to touch up on certain moves that may be troublesome and better yet learn new tricks to make moves a lot more easier to execute.I give it 4 stars because it isn't the best dvd neither is it the worst. It's a really good dvd, I would recommend it to anyone who'd like to do nothing but drills that break a sweat. However for beginners it maybe a bit hard to follow. It's still a good dvd."
4,Well crafted tale.,I loved how much importance each of the characters placed on his/her familial relations. That each person's future is the world to come is a wonderful perspective on how to live life.
4,Great writing but sometimes a challenge,this is a wonderful book but not a 'beach book'. the story is often disjointed and the plot so nonlinear that it was hard to follow if put down for any time period. Personally I did'nt enjoy some of the fantacy sections that interrupted the action but have great respect for the prose. The allegory of neonatal life that closed the book is a classic of imagery and a pure delight.
3,Geoffery's Animal Alphabet,"Can't buy a DVD, so this remastered version is as good as it gets. The kids love it! Video is not HD but better than the old VHS we use to play and the audio is fantastic."
5,An innovative account of the pre-Arthurian age!,This graphic novel retells the episodes related to Merlin from Geoffrey of Monmouth's HISTORIA REGUM BRITANNIAE (HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN). The narrative is told from the point of view of both Uther and Merlin through a series of flashbacks to explain why Uther is the half dead king of the title.
5,Great Book!,This book was great for me and my wife. It helped us understand some of the exercises we can do together to help throughout the process. They were really easy to understand and do from day 1 to the end. Our doctor worked with us and monitored the great progress we had going through the exercies. The pictures really help!Trust me it helped!
2,Looks can be deceiving,I was very disappointed in this item. It is much smaller in person than it appears in the picture and therefore not worth the $40+ it sold for. My friend bought it for my son for his birthday and was equally disappointed when she saw it at my home on it's size. My son does play with it but it's not what I was looking for.
3,Let's Say Grace,"This book has some very good grace prayers for mealtimes but many are not generalized for all occasion, every day. Instead they are specified for certain celebrations and occasions. It does give one the basics of saying grace and furnishes appropriate words."
3,A Concern,"The item description says that you can save any leftover flour/breading to use again, but there's a big problem with this...if you coated your chicken, etc. in egg first, then your leftover flour could be full of salmonella!Just something to consider."
4,I use it in flat wick lamps,"So I've heard time and again not to use this stuff in flat-wick lamps. But I do and it's not a problem. Maybe it's not as bright as kerosene but I had a kerosene lamp years ago that put out soot and awful odor. This does not. I'm willing to put up with 50% less light for 98% less particulate matter in the air. I use this one in a very small indoor space and yes there's the tiniest bit of odor but not it's not bad at all.Furthermore the bottle says ""For use in oil lamps and oil candles"" with a photo of a flat-wick oil lamp on it! So I think the manufacturer knows what will work in its own lamps. If I have a problem with the paraffin in a flat-wick lamp I'll come back and edit this review."
4,gift to the bride.,This was a gift for a long time family friend who is now a bride. She had specifically asked for this product on her wedding registry and as such I thought I would make her wish come true. Now I rest easy at night knowing that she has just the implements she wanted in her life in the kitchen.
2,not so good,"we bought this item for it's good review. But we can't pour the liquid from the bottle easily, every time you should screw to open the top, it is a trouble for me to use it."
5,Excellent insulated mug,"Been using this insulated travel mug almost every day since I got it and have no problems with it.Pros:-Keeps cold drinks cold for hours (haven't used it yet for hot drinks). The 16oz size is perfect for your typical energy drink can which I sometimes use this for.-Fits in the cup holder in my 2003 Chevy Tahoe (phew!).-Fluids flow nicely through the lid. I like how you can control the amount of flow by how much you turn the lid and it's designed to funnel smoothly to the lid's lip, i.e., it's not going to splash all over your mouth or flow unevenly.-Easy to clean withOXO Good Grips Bottle Brush.-Very stable base and overall feels tough as nails.Cons:-The carabiner rattles annoyingly when I have this tumbler in my truck's cupholder while driving. I don't need it so I took it off."
3,Great,I use this every morning for making my oatmeal during my drive to work. Cooks the oat great by the time i get to work.
5,"Great Desk, I've been using it for about 6 years","This is a great desk. I've had mine for about 6 years. It is very roomy, has space for all my junk. In fact, maybe too much space because I never keep it clean. I don't understand why it is so expensive on here though. I got mine at walmart for fifty bucks. It was great deal!"
5,surpisingly comfy,"i get tons of compliments on these boots - the heel is sexy, goes great with jeans, skirts and capris. and you can actually walk in them without your feet killing you the next day."
1,Toy broke after using it for 1 minute,THis toy was a piece of crap. It was poorly made and broke after playing with it for one minute. I would have returned it but needed it for my halloween costume so I didn't have time to order a new gun. It was not worth the money. I would not buy this gun even if it was just a penny. Do not buy this cheap gun!
1,Nearly Useless,"This cooking appliance is the first I've purchased with NO cooking guide or recipe booklet. The micro-print guide for vegetables on the back of the unit is not enough information to make me keep it. How much water should be added to rice in the rice bowl? Same as stove-top cooking, or less, because of the steam? What about brown rice, or pasta, or, as the instruction booklet suggests, poultry or meat? The instructions direct the user to ""fill the water reservoir...to the appropriate line"" with no advice about which fill line is appropriate.I'm not willing to waste food or ruin meals with trial-and-error. I'm returning the product today."
3,the shape is not good,"it is not small, however, the shape is not circle, it is hard to put a dish in it"
4,easy to find belts,Nice that this turns 360 degrees; makes it easy to find my belts; so much better than the previous holder
3,Review of Evriholder TAB-W Twirl A Belt,Product was easy to assemble and does what it needs to do especially for the price that was paid for it.
2,OK For A Few Belts,"I bought this with the matching tie rack, but ended up not using it. The tie rack is great because it can store a lot of ties in a small area, but I bought a different belt rack that could store several belts using a smaller amount of space."
3,Works alright,"It will work well enough holding your belts. But it would hang awkwardly if you don't hang the belts evenly all around. For the cost, it's not bad"
4,Does the job,"Works fine and holds the belts. It is a little cheaply made, but has not broken yet with about 20 belts loaded onto it."
1,Low Price Low Quality,This is cheap and the slightest bump knocks it off the rack. Spend a couple more dollars to buy a product with some weight to it and save yourself the trouble.
3,Expecting alot more............,"I'm a big fan of EJ's and was excited to get this and don't get me wrong,I like this,but there's alot of things that they left out or could've used than what's on this..Why not show something we haven't seen?? Some of us have the Madison Square Garden concert and we've seen the concert with the symphony orchestra,right?? It was on Bravo.What about the videos he's done from the past to present?? What about the solo tour with Ray Cooper in Russia??? What about his appearances he did on American tv shows??? What about the doc Ej and Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye to Norma Jean and Other Things??? Too much rare footage they could've used,but didn't...I like some of the rare footage,but there's not enough...Overall,nice package,great quality,but they could've done alot more with an artist like EJ....."
5,Great collection,"Even if you don't know any Japanese, you will be moved by Chihiro Onitsuka's singing. Onitsuka has a voice that's powerful and full of emotion. There are so many good songs in this collection. My favorites include ""Infection"", ""Gekkou (Moonlight)"", ""Memai (Dizziness)"" and ""We Can Go"". The lyrics are often about suffering and injustice. ""Gekkou"", for example, begins with the words, ""I am God's child, dropped onto this decayed world. How do I live on such a field?"" One might think this kind of music is depressing. But the irony is that her singing is so uplifting. It's like she's breathing life into the ""decayed world"". Incidentally, ""Gekkou"" remains popular in Japan, even though the song is six years old now.This is not your typical bubblegum J-pop music. Chihiro Onitsuka is a singer of substance, with a voice that sometimes soars into the stratosphere. If you are new to Japanese music, this is a good album to get. You won't be disappointed."
1,The infuser warps!,I was quite happy with this product until the infuser started to warp. After that I threw it away because the infuser wouldn't fit anymore in the slot and I wouldn't drink anything from a warped plastic container. Don't waste your money.
3,not what i expected,"i bought this teamaker because i interpreted the description to mean that it somehow brewed iced tea more easily than the usual boil-the-water-cool-it-off method. i found that the overnight in cold water method recommended makes really uninteresting tea. i started using the traditional boiling water method.since i bought this two years ago, i have had none of the problems more recent users have mentioned. the plastic on my model seems quite sturdy, so i suspect even bodum has succumbed to cheap manufacturing in the interim.as a convenient pitcher to cool and store iced tea in, its nice. and removing the tea leaves after brewing is simple with the insert--no need to juggle two containers and a seive. but it certainly isn't a clever, easier way to make iced tea."
3,No Instructions,"From reading the other reviews I am sure this will be a good product. However, I am glad the reviewers mentioned how to make the tea as there are no instructions provided. The pictures on the box are the only instructions available. (perhaps they are just missing from my order)"
5,I LOVE it!,"What more can I say? I think this thing is the best. Prior to this I was using cheesecloth to keep my loose leaf tea contained while making sun tea. It was a pain. With the Bodum Ice Tea Maker, it's so easy! I just pop in the tea leaves, add the water, and put the whole thing out in the sun. A few hours later, sun tea! Then I put a few springs of fresh mint in the filter side, add some sugar and put the whole thing in the fridge. Or, just pour it over ice. Really happy with this purchase."
3,Works great but won't last,"I am probably on my 4th or 5th pitcher....they all break either by cracking/leaking or the lid breaks off the top....the loose tea sleeve always breaks too! they last a year or 2, i make alot of iced tea tho!. not sure whether i will buy another one or not. might be best to find an alternative that will last."
4,It is what it is.,"If you are looking for a heavy duty iced tea maker...this is not the product. However, it works well to infuse tea and make iced tea with teabags. It is made of a thin plastic which wouldn't hold up using everyday but like a lot of items it has its purpose.It is thin, lightweight. This is the 2nd one I have purchased. It lasted about 3 years. For what i use it for ...it's great."
3,Disappointed,"The idea of the removable filter is awesome. However, the holes are to big in the filter and the tea leaves get through. It's great for fruit teas, not so good for leaf teas."
1,Celestron Oceana,I really wanted to give these binoculars a good review being that they are from an American company right near my home but sadly I cannot. The first pair I purchased were defective when the illuminator button fell out when I opened them to first examine them. The second pair I recieved were also defective because the Illuminator did not work at all and there was a black splotch in the viewing area that was internal and could not be cleaned by me. I give up. I will save my money and buy some Steiner's now.
4,Great Value,"Great Value!Last year (2010) I purchased these binocs by Celestron for $118US via Amazon.com.I have used them for a full cruising season and am quite pleased. They certainly exceed my expectations for relatively inexpensive binocs. I also have an older pair of West Marine branded binocs aboard (which have survived many years (at least 10) of marine use and not always the best treatment and are now showing their age). The West marine binocs cost about $150 more. The Oceana binocs are certainly comparable to these (even a bit better in some aspects). Optics and ergonomics are good, padded case included, backlit compass uses red light (battery included), quality of construction seems comparable to somewhat more expensive binocs. While the optics are not likely up to Steiner quality they are certainly quite adequate for typical boating use (low light performance is comparable to binocs costing a few hundred dollars more)."
4,Rangefinder Capabilities,The Celestron Oceana 7x50 overall is a great set of binoculars.Pros:-Great optics-Built tough-Built-in Electronic Compass-Attached Lense coversSuggestons for improvement:-Rangefinder scale needs better resolution (more lines)-Documentation should include formula as to what each scale line translates to in distance or object size (such as MIL or MOA)-Focus should have common adjustment for Left and Right eye pieces (this model requires that the Left and Right eye pieces be individually focused)
4,Very very good,"Hellfest looks like a very fun music festival to attend and this DVD does a very good job of showing what the Hellfest experience is like. With top notch performances from The Red Chord, Figure Four, Full Blown Chaos, Terror, Biohazard, Unearth, Lamb of God, Death Threat etc. any fan of hardcore should enjoy this DVD. I wont even bother commenting on the punk bands that are on this DVD (Bouncing Souls, Anti-Flag, Thursday) because that crap isn't even music. Listen to Lamb of God and TERROR!"
1,Cracks after a short time,"I was foolish enough to buy 3 of these. Each one developed a crack in the inner liner after being used for about a week or two. In addition, the top tends not to seal well and often leaks. This product looks great but performs poorly."
2,Great until it cracked.,This item was great until it cracked after about two months of use. Before it cracked I would have rated it four stars.
2,"Ok for home and a single cup, but it doesn't travel well","Being a commuter to an office where everyone else is satisfied with burnt coffee, I was optimistic this would solve my caffeine needs. Alas, while the coffee this tiny french press (enough for a healthy mug) brews is delicious, it does leak!Because I have a wonderful, reliable 8-cup (read ""two mug"") glass Bodum at home, I'll keep this at work. If you buy this, I recommend you use it the same way - unless you want to increase your dry-cleaning bill.If anyone's used the thermal Bodum travel press, please write a review. Does it also leak?"
2,'if it's too good to be true'........,"The concept of French Press coffee to 'GO'is a dream come true for a coffee lover.HOWEVER, I have yet to have found the correct temperature of hot water to pour into the cup without it cracking and traveling up the sides of the double insulated clear cup or TOO cool to have tepid brown liquid with no flavor.I've tried four cups and all have cracked. Until the company improves the cup material, I'll have to settle for something else."
2,cracked after 2 mos,"the first 2 months of using this little contraption at work really had me hooked on french-press coffee. The convenience, and the flavor. But today something odd happened. I was drawing hot water from the machine at work, and I heard two distinct cracking sounds, like the sound ice cubes make in water. Later on I discovered what had happened. It basically shattered on the inside, and started leaking through into the vacuum. I've never seen plastic do this. I'm taking it back, getting my money back, and seeing if they have a glass one I can leave at work."
5,Only the best controller for the Nintendo 64!,"This is the greatest choice for one of the the greatest game systems made. It makes a fantastic addition to your Nintendo Zelda games. Even if you are some psycho and for some reason don't like zelda, hey its a gold controller! better than a bland grey one anyday.P.S. Make sure to get one that doesn't have any messed up loose analog sticks, or else playing games can become frustrating.Otherwise, enjoy!"
2,Not real CorningWare,"This item is not like the original CorningWare. A company called World Kitchens bought the rights to the CorningWare name and uses it on stoneware products. The product is made in China, not Corning, NY. My real complaint is the limited utility of the dishes. A sheet that comes with the dishes warns not to use them under a broiler, under a microwave browning element, in a toaster oven, or any other direct heating source. Obviously, they can't be used to make creme brulee or even shrimp scampi."
4,Shallow for toaster ovens,"Yes you can use this in the oven, but for it's low profile, it works amazingly well for toaster ovens. Yet the only size larger I can find is a 1 & 1/2 qt shallow corningware dish. But perfect for small meals that need a quick heating instead of using the toxic microwave. Tried and true for veggies for use in the toaster oven. Just add some water and keep your oven mitts close."
3,Typical Zydeco In An Atypical Place,"If you've wanted to jump into the vigor and joy of zydeco with both feet, but don't want to spend a fortune, here's a good place to start. Rapone hits a number of zydeco standards with verve and without a lot of fuss. His band is quite good, particularly Ms. LaRue;They have some lovely harmonies together. Their UK audience is enthusiastic, and if this lacks the pristine sound quality some better-known and more prolific artists of the genre get, that still doesn't get in the way of musical enjoyment.It's a shame so little of Rapone's work, especially with this particular group, is recorded, or perhaps there's more in the vault that's unreleased. He deserves to be better known."
5,My first tea press and I love it.,I have always been a tea drinker but used standard tea bags in the past. I saw the two-cup version of this tea press in a magazine and knew I had to have it. Its a pretty little tea press and does a wonderful job of making my morning tea. I can honestly say that the tea I make now is so much more flavorful than that made from a tea bag. This tea press has elevated my appreciation of tea to a whole new level.
2,Not an impressive stuff,"Yes, you can press garlic without peeling, but you will also have to pull the skin out everytime you put another glove, unless you only need one glove.This is my first garlic press. I don't know how other press work like, but I still can tell that this is not a very good one. Not comfortable in hand and fell apart very soon. I already fix it twice since I got it. I just use it a couple times..Don't buy it."
4,What first wave ska revival should have sounded like.,"Good band. Unlike the other Minnesota ska bands on the concert/recording scene right now, these guys have a record that's very easy to purchase. It's good musicians who sound loose. They have been able to find creative room in non-mainstream, established genre. Good stuff!"
5,Door Stop,"I bought this product a couple months back, and every since i have been using it! No problems so far, does what it says and is a great price."
4,A sensitively told story about real people in an extraordinary situation,"I saw Three of Hearts at an NYC screening and was really impressed with both the bravery of the documentary's three characters and the filmmaker's sensitivity in telling such a personal story. Threesomes may be an interesting rarity, and the film could have been exploitative, aiming for titillation and shock, but instead it's a really well-told story spanning years, covering all of the natural highs and lows of the relationship, from love and sex to finances and children.I think in the end it shows how strikingly normal this rather unusual set-up is, and how the people in it have to deal with all of the same things people in more common partnerships do. It's also consistently funny and entertaining to watch, though its being realistic and honest about the relationship means it has its bittersweet and even uncomfortable moments as well."
4,what do moths eat?,"Martha is a moth that is getting ready for her birthday bash. As she cooks the ""food"" for her party she gets really hungry. She ends up eating all but 2 socks! When her friends arrive she is really sad she has no food to serve them. Read and find out how they cheer her up!The books was well written and just the right length for a picture book. The pages had lots of great illustrations to talk about while reading.Yes. It's a neat way to learn about moths!"
1,Wrong descriptions of myers brigg types please r/o,"I read this book and I read a lot of books on Myers Brigg types. Some of the descriptions are right but a lot are not on the money. For example: INFP and ENFJ are the less creative types who want formal types of prayer. (Then on another page, INFP's want spontaneous prayer - Augustine or Franciscan type of prayer?) Horrible book. There are other books that explain the Myers Brigg types more accurately."
5,My daughter stole this my copy.,"I've had this book since before she could read. When she got old enough to appreciate the content, I let her borrow it. Now, I'm pretty sure it lives in her dorm room. Honestly, this isn't the worst outcome. Perhaps she'll share it with her friends. I'll buy another for myself. Thank you so much for this delightful book."
5,I could not put this book down,"I was given this book as a graduation present. I have to say the thing that I like about it most was that it does not really relate intellectually, it really makes you think about yourself and not so much about other people. All the stories were interesting. There were some views I personally did not agree with, but I really love the idea that women should love every aspect of themselves. This is not really a manhatting book at all, it's about women bettering themselves for the good of themselves."
3,Book.,I ordered my book August 31st. It is now September 26th and I still don't have it...This is not okay.
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!,"I LOVE this book, this is the third copy i have bought because i just keep giving them away! every woman should read this at least once, i've read my copy probably 20 times already! <3"
4,Pretty neat,"Well, I wasn't expecting a really great A-quality ring for the price; as in, real steel, comfortable, etc. But it's a good ring nonetheless. The little screws in the back holding two armors dig into the back of my finger, but not terribly bad. The ring is comfortable if worn right, so it just takes adjustment and practice.Personally, I love the ring. I got it to 'sample' what armor rings were like, if I wanted to buy a more expensive one later. With proper care and polish, this ring will last a long time, and remember that it's a decoration ring, it will bend if you try to use it as tool."
5,very good brush,used weekly holding up wonderful we had a tougher than normal application to clean and it does awesome recommend this product highly
5,Impressive documentery,"I was in the US for the first time a few days after Columbine, so I do remember this tragic event well. This documentery tells the story of the families who lost a love one on april 20th 1999. Good to see the families have heeled a bit since Columbine. This documentery is a must have for people who are interest in what happenend at Columbine High School and want to know a little bit more about the 13 people who were killed and their loved ones. Let us hope that tragedies like Columbine won't happen again if you realise the pain these 13 families had to go through."
2,Perhaps best for the Brust fan,"Steven Brust's fantasy novels created a rich world, with plenty of room for narrative exploration and adventure. Characters, magical elements, and a smart-mouthed mini-dragon offered readers plenty of fantastic imagery.It just didn't come together for me in this graphic form. The story adaptation lacked a bit - parts of the mythos might remain opaque to viewers not already familiar with Brust's stories. I could live with that, but the watercolor renderings just weren't strong enough to bring it to life for me. John J. Muth'sMoonshadow, for example, shows just how literal and expressive watercolor can be. This, on the other hand, comes across as merely competent.The story pulls the reader in and the artwork carries the reader along, but I can't say that either stands out. The whole, unfortunately, wasn't quite the sum of the parts.-- wiredweird"
5,This thing is great,"I haven't found a jar that this thing won't open; it even handles those vacuum sealed fruit jars like they're nothing.If I have a complaint, and it's a minor one, you have to be careful with the can opener lever. The lever comes off for cleaning which is nice but it also comes off easily if you have it up. It goes back in easy enough but it's a bit annoying."
1,Bothersome problems,"The Jar opener portion works great.To raise the upper the release mechanism only moved one of two pins keeping the top over. The second pin had yo be moved manually.Using the Can opener is not convenient. Kept coming off the housing.Phil, Laguna Woods, CA."
1,This is feminism?,"I thought feminism was about choosing your destiny, not necessarily succumbing to biology.I didn't know that it was now imperative that women accept that they have pretty much no choice but to ""breed"" to feel self-worth, AND to be proud of it as ""our destiny"" and our primary value to society, AND to expect entitlements from un-childed persons because of a choice that BREEDERS make.Making imperative breeding seem like a ""cool"" thing to do is only a guise. What's really happening is a reversal of everything feminists have worked hard to achieve. The CHOICE of having children, and it being OKAY not to have them. I mean JUST AS okay not to have them. The child-free life is not a lesser calling, yet you would get that impression from reading this book. The fact that these women call themselves ""breeders"" says it all.To me this book represents nothing more than a slap in the face to any *real* feminist."
2,tastes like medicine,"disappointed. the mix of tea tree oil, menthol and cinnamon was too medicine-like. the shipping way overpriced. save your dough!"
2,Outdated Trail Guide,"Wow, how did this book get on Amazon! I own this book as I collect trail books of Sedona and Flagstaff for their historical purposes. Not that this wasn't a good book for its time. A lot of the trails are no longer there and there are so many new trails that are much more fun to ride!You could get very, VERY lost if you relied on this book!"
4,Good quality; a little too shallow,"The item works fine and looks good. My only complaint is that the dish a little too shallow. It could be a little deeper/taller, perhaps with a smaller diameter. If it were deeper, I would have given it a five. Arrived in perfect condition."
3,They're OK & a great value but 10x50's are better,"I recently bought the Nikon 10x50 ""action"" binoculars and I LOVE them. Super clear, crisp images. I read reviews saying that 10x50's were the best combination of magnification & light transmission & size. Did I listen to those reviews? No. I wanted more magnification. The Celestron 15x70 are good but the Nikon's are better/more clear & less ""vibration"" (because they are slightly lower magnification). These Bino's are OK but 1 pair of good 10x50's would have been sufficient for day & night (astronomy) use."
5,Nice binocular,This is a very nice binocular. You can hold it with your hand when using it at the daytime. And you'd better using the tripod when you want to stargazing at night. It is easy to see the four moons of Jupiter by this binocular. Very sharp and bright!!
5,great binos,"What a wonderfull binoculars , it worth the price , can believe that such product is so cheap an very reliable"
4,I see you,"Good pair of binocs, pretty heavy though, so I can't hold them up for too long. Since they're so heavy I wish they would have come with a strap."
5,"Amazing quality, Low price!!","You won't find a better deal. Great quality,(was expecting less for the price). Comes with tripod adapter,case,dust cloth,lens covers,cheap as hell strap and instructions.Rubberized outer shell for water proof.You don't need a tripod for these dont be misled. You can easily hold these just like any other smaller pair and steady them,when you get used to them you can even hold them with one hand because they are lightweight for their size. Very good 3D images, I am very pleased with these and very happy I did not spend alot of $ for them."
4,Celestron SkyMaster,The binoculars are fantastic. The site is clear and distance is good. The weight can be an issue if you do not have a steady hand or holding it for a long streatch of time. I would recomend the SkyMaster.
3,Needs stabilization,"These are very nice binoculars but difficult to use without a tripod or other form of stabilization. If you don't have a tripod, propping your elbows against a solid surface while using them helps. However, they're not a great choice for free viewing because of their length and weight."
4,Perfect for a beginner,"I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas, as he has become interested in learning more about astronomy. Since he is a beginner, I thought, instead of purchasing a telescope for a small fortune, I would get him a good pair of binos to start with. He loves them! I was worried about them being out of culmination after reading all of the reviews, but the pair we received are flawless. We tried using them without a tripod for a while, but quickly realized that a tripod was a must in order to see anything clearly. We just ordered an inexpensive, universal tripod and it works perfectly. Obviously, the power on these binos is not strong enough to see the surfaces of the planets, but we are able to see the four moons of Jupiter and Orion's nebula, and they give a great view of the moon and all of the craters. Whether you are a beginner and wanting to learn more about astronomy, or just looking to add a quality pair of binos to your collection, these should not disappoint you."
4,SkyMaster 15x70mm Binocular Review,"Optically, it seems to have decent quality for the price.I have noticed that many other reviewers giving good ratings on optics.However, regarding the tripod adaptor there seems to be some problem.First of all, female thread(1/4-20)location on the binocular was not balanced; front objective lens side is way too heavy compare to eyepiece side; the location of the female thread should be moved to more balancing point.2nd, the material for both male & female thread is aluminum; it should be made of steel considering the rather heavy(3-5 pound)one for binocular. It already showed wear on alum thread just after a few usage.I find the tripod adaptor was flimsy and inadequate; it does not provide solid, sturdy or secure holding on binocular. It need to be improved.But overall, with relatively good optics, it's not too bad for the price.Isaac"
2,Disappointing,"While I was glad that the series ended the way it did, I was very disappointed with Druid's Sword as a whole. The characters were pathetic paper cutouts of what the had been in the previous books, and spent most of their time focusing on petty insults and drama and sitting around moping about how they couldn't do anything about the Troy Game. I was very disappointed with how Noah was stuck in the background - she had been the foremost character in the previous book and was now she demoted to a minor role, not to mention how her personality was so changed. Also, it really bothered me how everyone depended on Jack for the answers. He was the most volatile character in the previous books and now everyone bows to his wisdom and judgment. All in all, Douglass failed to capture the characters that she portrayed in her previous books, and I didn't enjoy reading it. I would recommend reading it for closure to the series, but that's about it."
1,Horrible Last Book in What WAS a Great Series,"In this last book all the characters became flat and one dimensional. They lost their passion and interest. And several of them did a 180 in the views and loves with no explanation or information leading up to their changes. I was really shocked and disappointed at how bad this last book was, considering how good the rest were. I was looking forward to rereading this series many times in the future, now it will go to the thrift shop."
3,Can't turn over cause I'm too big,"I would say the Swiss Gear SG11081 Belay Mummy 0-degree Sleeping Bag is a very good product. It kept me very warm while motorcycle camping right after Christmas. The nighttime temps got down to 25 degrees. It was warm.It was not big enough for my clausstrophobic mind. I am 6'2"" 225lbs. The bag kept me warm, but I did not have enough room. My fiance just inherited it. I had to get a 40""x90"" mummy bag. The Swiss Gear bag is a very warm bag and has quality enough to have a great warranty."
2,Design could use some work....,The sleeping bag is warm.....if only the zippers were of better quality..zippers broke loose after first camping trip.
3,For my husband,"I wanted to give my husband an auto magazine for Christmas and this among the choices I was given for a bonus gift for something I bought. He likes the magazine, but doesnot love it, because he is in to older cars. He said that it is a good magazine though. It isn't thick."
2,"For $5 a year, I am sure they can write a couple good stories","I had let my subscription expire as I got tired of the same ol' stories about how the ultra expensive mostly european hot cars were so superior to US products. The US products offer similar and sometimes superior performance to the million dollar exotics at an often small percentage of the price. They are a value that is not comparable to the high priced vehicles. I got tired of the review comparisons of the two catagories. For $5, I will read the reviews on the GM hot cars (Caddies/Vettes/Camaros), the Ford Pony cars and MoPar SVTs. I will still read the reviews of the expensive cars, but when looking at the prices,I think of the phase where a fool and his money is seperated! I don't have those kind of funds, so don't have to worry about that occurance, so will spend the $5 as the mag is ok for that price... so I can buy a US muscle vehicle for my small fleet. PS: We do own a BMW 335i hardtop convertible, it is fun!"
4,¡Muy bueno! ¡Muy romántico! Very good!,"This book is actually in Spanish, so I'll try my best to write something about it in Spanish.¡Lo siento! Mi español es muy malo. Peor. Pero, leo mejor y gozo de las novelas del Harlequin en español.Connal tener uno misterioso vida. Él desea para olvidar. Él bebe demasiado. Muchas copas. Lo intoxican y casada a hija del jefe en México. La novia cree que la boda no es auténtica porque es en México. Él no recuerda la boda. ¡Por supuesto, la novela termina con amor verdadero!Tengo gusto de este libro. Libro muy bueno. Muy romántico.I really liked this book. It had a typical Diana Palmer flair and I enjoyed the characters. I've tried to follow the stories about all of Connal's brothers as well! I recommend this novel!"
2,Handle Burned,"I loved the tea press. The simple design and the fact that it poured very nicely. You can not put the pot on a gas stove directly because the handle starts to melt. I realized that the handle was made of plastic, but it stated that it was resistant to heat up to 500 degrees. I recommend buying the tea warmer stand or pouring hot water in the pot and letting the tea sit in it. I think this press was not suitable for me because I prefer to add other spices and boil the water for some time. I later purchased a tea pot with a diffuser that had a glass handle and it works very well and was a bit cheaper."
4,Almost great,"I really enjoyed the book. It made a lot of sense to me, and led me to re-ask questions that I had shrugged off.But I felt conned when I found that the book was fiction. Then the book became more about opinions and wasn't really a historical representation of the fruits of the beliefs and questions of the book."
5,Very freeing!,"Truly one of the best books I've ever read and the timing was divine. This, however, is not a book to read if you are not drawn to it. And if you judge this book by it's cover, you are in for a surprise."
5,Well-satisfied buyer,"I was pleasantly surprised that there was no typical ""church-bashing"", but the book was filled with a sense of how much our Heavenly Father seeks to have meaningful relationship with us, His children. It revealed that the organization of the ""church"" can take on a life in itself, totally apart from being the ""body and bride"" of Christ. It certainly pointed me toward the Father."
2,Would not recomend it to educated Church members,"Excellent points about the mistakes, materialism, power and human doctrine fanatic approach of many churches. However, the authors fail to describe the word Church and they claim that the Church is an ethereal, non physical entity which may or may not exist in a physical (human group) form. They also claim that the best option is in houses with non-commitment occasional and spontaneous reunions.They seem to ignore that the word Church whose original word is from the Greek word Ecclesia means: The group of believers gathered in faith."
5,LOVE our CE 8.0,"We bought the Smooth CE-8.0 elliptical directly from SmoothFitness.com. It was one of the best purchases we've ever made. The elliptical is strong, sturdy, SMOOTH, and nicely crafted. It took about an hour to assemble. It is whisper-quiet and we can watch TV while using it with no problem. You can move it around fairly easily. It is a substantial machine so does take up a lot of space, but that's okay. I love the longer stride because I am tall. Would definitely recommend Smooth to anyone. Their machines are just like the ones at the gym, if not better."
1,Question about stability,"We put ours together ourselves. I am an experienced electromechanical assembler. Ours was missing a bolt in the base of that mast, which Smooth would absolutely not send to us. We eventually bought one from a hardware store.Now that it's done, is the entire vertical mast assembly supposed to move around? I expected it to be stable but you can grab the stationary handles and move the entire display/mast assembly laterally. Is this normal?"
1,No benefits from Smooth,"Smooth does not recognize the purchase of their equipment from Amazon, other then (maybe)some warranty stuff. They have training information on using their equipment that they share with their customers who purchase directly from them, as far as they are concerned I am not a customer therefore do not warrant anything from them. This is new equipment purchased from Amazon and not second hand stuff. I will never purchase another piece of equipment from them. Obviously they have no respect for customers."
4,Great Album Start to Finish,"I had the great fortune to live in Spain through most of 1997 and though I didnt speak spanish particularly well you cant escape the local music even if you tried. I bought several discs over there which featured a catchy song which was a hit over there only to discover that there really was nothing else worth a second listen on the disc. On the other hand, there was ""La Flaca"" by Jarabe de Palo. I thoroughly enjoyed this one! the title track was a giant hit that year and deservedly so. However the entier disc includes a nice mix of musical styles into a disctinctive rock sound. The only complaint I had was the use of sythesizers on two or three tracks just didnt seem to fit in with the rest of the disc, which has a very minimalist ""just the music"" feel to it with no electronic effects or the like. But I can overlook that for a great CD."
4,Allmost the cap I have been looking for.,"I have been looking for a low profile cap in light blue denim. I have bought several caps over the past couple years, ranging in price from $15 to $30. I have been happy with none of them. The only thing wrong with this cap is a few missing stitches in the bill, which make no real difference to me. I miss the days when ""Made in the USA"" was proudly proclaimed on most items I bought, and this cap is made in China - but then, It would have sold for double the price if made here.The adjustment is not cheap-made plastic, but denim strap with a metal clasp. Also a feature I have been looking for in a cap, but have seen rarely as of late.I am a cap kind of guy, so I am sure I will be buying more of these if this one holds up as I expect it to. I recommend it."
4,Good intro to the most interesting item in the universe.,"Robert Ornstein is a neurobiologist and co-author David Sobel is an M.D., and together they can write. This is a clear, readable, informative introduction to the brain and its impact on human health - surely one of the most fascinating frontiers in medicine. I read the 1986 edition of the book; some smart paperback publisher should get Ornstein and Sobel to write a new chapter summarizing the latest research in this fast changing field."
5,Present for my friends son,"We got this and a bug net for my friends son, while he lost the bug net this his thoroughly enjoyed! especially the rubber spider and catching tiny moths to put in it"
3,"Galilee means ""land of the Gentiles""","I doubt the authenticity of the family lineage of Jesus. In Matthew, it was Jesse to David to Solomon (see Matthew 1:06), : in Luke, it was Jesse to David to Nathan (see Luke 3:31). See also John 7:52 and Matthew 4:14."
1,Ear Ache,I have search high & low for the perfect pair of headphones to use while working out. These are not them. They're too large for my ears and are uncomfortable to wear. Might work for someone with bigger ears though.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Some more entertaining Invincible action. Mark goes off to do the university thing, and has to deal with the evil American roommate idea, and having a secret identity and living with a stranger sort of problem.How to keep a girlfriend, some good old fashioned super villain violence, and being tested by an alien superhuman planet defender inspector."
3,Bollywood compilation,Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Just didn't like 1/5 the selection. The Bollywood heavy music was excellent but there was a lot of rap mixed in.
1,Be Careful! These CD-R could be Ritek's CD-R!,"TDK used to be my favorite CD-Rs. They were used to be made in USA, now they are being produced in Taiwan. I bought TDK CD-R spindle from Amazon a couple of times, and I have 100% failure with all the TDK CD-Rs I bought from Amazon! ...A quote from [another] website ...:By selling RiTEK made CD-R's TDK has seriously damaged their credibility of selling quality CD-R media, as stores don't know the difference between these CD-R's and just sell them for one price. Usually this price is higher than the regular RiTEK made CD-R's. So check the package before buying TDK CD-R's!"
3,Forget the Body Fat/Water Analysis...,"This scale accurately and consistently measures weight, but the body fat & body water analysis is so inconsistent I don't even know what values are correct. From consecutive readings taken at one minute intervals, readings have varied by up to 10%. That makes it an expensive weight scale."
2,VERY buggy,"Same problem as stated earlier; using English units, I could only select heights of 3'3"" to 3'4"" and, since I'm 5'7"", my 170 pounds would make a 3'4"" person morbidly obese. Doing things in metric was more consistent, but I still found rather wild swings in fat and water measurements at times (60% water one day, 30% the next). Don't waste your money unless you use metric and even then, beware. But of course, even a metric-lover would have to admit that kilograms measure mass, not weight, so kilograms are technically not the unit I'm looking for."
1,"Unusable, cap not working","The device is unusable, the cap does not close properly and it leaks. I bought two of them, same on both. Looking for something else now."
3,Great Old Movie,Old movies are always fun to watch and this one had some great makeup and presentation for its time. Also interesting to compare it to similar movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
5,"If You Enjoy A Stronger Coffee, Give This A Try.","I enjoyed this coffee, my wife enjoys this coffee, and it's likely that you will too."
2,Disappointed,This was not what I expected. I like Midnight Magic and I thought this would be similar; but it wasn't. It had very little flavor and was not strong enough! I will not buy it again.
5,"Rich, Strong & Flavorful",There is more coffee in these K-Cups than most of the others. We found one other and have been using our Keurig as our everyday coffee maker ever since. We were originally disappointed because we were used to a strong cup of coffee. I tried using less water with the other K-Cups but with these I can use the regular water amount and still have a great cup of coffee. If you like strong these are the K-Cups to buy along with Parisian Nights.
4,Good lift and learn,"I purchased a similar book (title must've been slightly different) a few years ago. The other one told the story of the the little engine that could and the flaps differed a little. This book sort of tells the story. If you want a book to tell the story, you will probably have to buy the normal book as I haven't seen the other lift the flap in at least 4 years, maybe longer. Anyway, the book teaches abcs, opposites, etc. with a very simplified version of the familiar story. The illustrations are ok. The cover is a good indication for illustrations inside. This is a particularly good gift for young kids who enjoy trains. I purchased the book for a co-worker and her son (age 3) was thrilled!"
5,Magnificent Movie and All Star Cast,"I enjoyed Murder On The Orient Express when it was released in the movie theaters in 1974....this movie is my all time favorite including Death on the Nile, Evil under the Sun, Ten Little Indians and A Caribbean Mystery...have been a huge Agatha Christie fan. I loved watching the superb performances of a huge excellent cast considers of: Jacqueline Bisset, Ingrid Bergman who won her well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress playing a Swedish Missionary for her short role in the film, Wendy Hiller, Rachel Roberts, Albert Finney, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Jean Pierre Cassel, Richard Widmark, Martin Balsam and Lauren Bacall...This movie I can watch over and over many times."
3,May be disappointing,"While the movie is a faithful adaptation of Agatha Christie's book, Albert Finney's portrayal of the quirky but brilliant Hercule Poirot is disappointing. Even those who are not familiar with David Suchet's interpretation will be disappointed if they have read many of the Poirot mysteries. Gone are most of Poirot's most obvious traits--his enormous vanity, his charm, his fastidiousness. If Albert Finney was familiar with Agatha Christie's character at all before the movie, it was only a very slight aquaintance.The rest of the cast is impeccable--Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Ingred Bergman--the list goes on and on. While some parts of the story have been changed, they are only slight changes and the movie remains true to the spirit and story of the book."
4,Good Christie rendition,"This was a gift for a friend who is an avid reader and Agatha Christie fan. She said it's a great movie - it only received 4 stars, however, because of the age of the film and the resultant film quality discrepancy."
4,A Classy Whodunit,"Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most famous stories, and in this film it is brought to life by an amazing cast. Businessman Richard Widmark is found dead with multiple stab wounds while aboard the famous train, and it's up to passenger and detective extraordinaire Hercule Poirot, played by Albert Finney, to solve the crime while everyone waits for the tracks to be uncovered from fallen snow. Surprisingly, my only criticism of the film is the lead performance by Finney, which is mannered, difficult to understand at times, and not at all what I picture Poirot as being like, having read a number of Christie's books. The rest of the cast is terrific, with special praise going to Ingrid Bergman and Wendy Hiller. The final scenes of revelation are very well done, and whether or not you already know the story and solution to the crime, I think you will find this movie to be very entertaining."
5,Awesome Book,I've read countless books on ActionScripting and this one is by far the best. The author obviously has a talent for teaching that puts this book heads and shoulders above many other Flash ActionScript books that have received excellent reviews on this site. Get this book if you REALLY want to understand not only how to use ActionScripting but WHY you want to use it. I can't tell you how may Ah Ha! moments I've had reading it. Excellent!
5,"Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2",Tastes great and the price was good.
4,Timothy's Kona Blend,"Timothy's Kona Blend is excellent. The K-cups are ultra-convenient & easy to use, and the coffee is fresh & tasty. I will re-order again & again."
3,Live Acoustic,Great sound but only 20 minutes!!Based on the 20 minutes would not recommend unless price is adjusted downwards.
3,love the cradle,"I purchased this cradle for my 5 year old granddaughter because I liked the looks of it.The cradle is large enough and very sturdy. The mattress, blanket and pillow are cute, but the pillow was not stuffed (just a piece of cloth). So I'm making another set with a stuffed pillow, mattress and quilt, so that she can change the doll's bed."
4,Great Doll Cradle,We love the doll cradle. It is durable and perfect for most dolls. The bedding inside was poorly lined and inadequate for the size of the cradle. This was shabby in comparison to the beauty of the cradle itself. Overall the cradle met with satifaction and would be recommended.
5,Very nice,"My 2YO daughter loves this doll cradle. She will put her babies to ""sleep"" and sing a song to them as she's rocking the bed. Or if her babies are ""awake"" she'll sing row row row your boat.The bedding that comes with it is junk and it ended up in the garbage. Instead I folded up a receiving blanket to lay on the bottom.The cradle is very cute, sturdy, and seems well made. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Too Sweet!!,Very sturdy easy to put together and my little one loved it !Would like a plumper pillow and cover but that's not a big thing.
4,ATT Corded Phone w/Speakerphone/Caller ID/Call Waiting,It works well as advertised. However its display is not very easy to read.
2,Incomplete Instructions,"The basic problem I have with the phone concerns the written instructions. I needed to read betwwen the lines in the manual and make some trial-and-error experimentation. Three weeks after receiving the phone, I am still running into problems not addressed in the manual."
2,ATT 950 Phone Caller ID Unreadable,"This phone works well except the main feature we bought it for, the caller ID screen has faded and is now unreadable. This is the second ATT phone with a caller ID screen that has failed."
1,Not up to expected standard.,"You would think after all these years that AT&T would be able to make a phone where you could actually read the display screen. There is no backlight, therefore you almost need a flashlight and magnifying glass to see the print on the display screen. The sound quality and many features are good but if you want to use the caller id feature, you will be disappointed, like me, with the display. With all the technology available today, why couldn't AT&T get the most important feature to work where it's usable to consumers?"
2,Wall Phone???,"The ATT 950 Corded Phone was the only phone that I could find that had caller ID, preset call buttons, could be wall mounted, had no answering machine but was battery operated and at a reasonable price. Operationally, every thing seemed fine even the initial set-up that I accomplished while the phone was resting horizontally. However, after mounting the phone on the kitchen wall at the standard height that I had used for years, the fatal flaw of this phone became apparent. The display screen was tilted to make viewing easier when the phone was used as a desk phone but the angle of the screen is so severe that the characters cannot be seen while standing. With this type of LCD screen your eyes need to be practically perpendicular to the screen, which means that you have to kneel to see the display. The characters are also small, further complicating visibility. Will keep the phone but will be annoyed each time I try to read the display."
2,Poor Wall Phone,"When adjusted for wall mounting, this phone still faces down, making the display dark and hard to read and the entire keypad poorly positioned. Not acceptable because of poor design."
2,Not great,This worked for a little while but after about 2 weeks it started shorting out. now it only works at a certain angle and if i move it it disconnects and reconnects then my computer says there is problems with it.
4,Cingular 8125,"Great Product,Works right out of the box, shipping and payment easy as pie. I would recommend getting the 1 gb mindisk from kingston, its only 7.00 bucks."
5,Good stuff...,CD's work great. I previously had an issue with other cheaper blank CD's in that I could not burn music from itunes. It always kept giving me this error. i switched to these CD's and I burned it at a slower speed (8x) and now it works great. Sounds great too.
3,K CDs,There ok. don't work in most computers and only have 700mb of memory space on them. good for moving data from computer to computer. As long as there the same operating system its fine Ive found.
1,weak,"the ""certified plus"" tdk's don't work with my burner. the burner locks up and freezes the program"
5,new remix of the marvelous dance song,"The English release of the Dee Dee's first hit Foreverfeatures a new remix: Pulser Dub. Mystical and innovative, dark and strong. If you like Dee Dee, this cd is a must! And there is a present for all Dee Dee's fans - enhanced video of the song!Buy it!"
2,Mediocre Quality,"I ordered these 1,000-thread count Pike Street sheets and received sheets made in Egypt with a Pike Street tag that said 1,200 thread count. These sheets are not much thicker than my 600-thread count sheets. The sheets appear to have been manually finished, as the edge sewing is uneven (I think I could have done a better job, and I'm a guy). Lastly, there was spotting on the sheets. I did not wash the sheets (instead opting to return them), so I don't know if the spots would have come out or whether this is a bad dye job. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Rough Scratchy Material,"Although the material of the sheets appear to be exremely durable, they are very scratchy. My husband said they reminded him of government issued bedding. I was very disappointed with this purchase. Lesson learned: the high thread count is not indicative of the material softness."
2,Disappointing,I bought these sheets as a gift and feel embarrassed that they are so heavy and rough. My friend sleeps hot so these are not going to work well for her.
2,Not what I expected from high thread count Egyptian Cotton!,"I purchased this set of 1,000 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets and am very disappointed. They are scratchy and not at all soft! I just hope that I can get the softness/crispness that I want with many more washings."
2,"Nice sheets, WRONG SIZE!","We live outside of the U.S. and had these sheets, ordered in a Queen size, sent to a friend in NYC who then mailed them to us, with considerable extra cost to us. We received the package, labeled Queen - only to find King sized sheets inside! As we have both a California King and a Queen sized bed in our house - the sheets do us no good. It is unfortunate, as they seem like nice sheets. In reading the prior reviews, I decided the company is dealing in seconds and slightly irregular goods - and it was probably a ""luck-of-the-draw"" chance of getting a really nice or really crummy set of sheets. At the price, I took the chance, and lost. If we had the ability, I would return them. Unfortunately, we would lose more money than the sheets cost. So, buyer be aware!"
3,very thick and rough,sheets are great size did not think 1000 thread count would be so thick sheets good for winter have washed many times to soften up remind me of motel sheets would not purchase again
4,"Very nice for price paid, but not great luxury sheets","I purchased these while on sale for $70. They are excellent sheets for the price I paid, but they are certainly not $400 sheets. I would never actually think that I could buy quality sheets for 17% of retail. The sheets do wrinkle, but they are very soft and comfy. I would buy again for the same price."
3,"Slow, Disappointing","My experience with Tanith Lee's novels is rather hit and miss, and I'm afraid this one falls into the latter category. Only my love of some of her other works kept me reading until the end - to be ultimately disappointed.This is actually two stories; in one the vapid Vitra is a Fabulast who lives on the dark side of the planet, and she is writing a story about the spoiled Vel Thaidis who lives on the light side of the planet. Or is it a story? After a crime is committed in each world, the stories strangely take on a life of their own - which is explained in the last chapter.Definitely not Lee's best work, but you can see shadows of concepts explored more fully in other books, like the spoiled teens fromDon't Bite the Sun (Starmont Hardcover Collection, No 1)and the evil (almost incestuous) twins ofThe Silver Metal Lover. She hints at the eroticism that is an integral part of her other works, but never delivers."
5,Awesome!,"Cell phone pouch is a great buy ... very well made and accommodates phone with extended battery quite nicely. Clip is very snug ... phone is very snug, but can be removed with one hand without coming loose from whatever you have it clipped on. I felt the price was very fair."
4,Read for Class,"This book was a pretty good source of article information for a class I took. If you are looking for something that helps open the mind regarding what ""white"" means in race/status this is the book for you."
2,A Cautionary Note To Students--,"This Author has been known to ignore events, & cite unobtainable sources that, try as they might, scholars cannot verify.This author is notorious for errors, serious omissions, & questionable ""sources"" in his work.If you are a student, DO NOT CITE THIS MAN'S BOOKS AS SOURCE MATERIAL IN A PAPER OR THESIS!"
1,Junk!!!,"I had one of these four track's about 11 years ago,and the thing was total junk.It lasted me about a month,then all the wires from the tape head just popped right off.For NO REASON at all.I had to throw it in the trash.Even when it was working,I could not get the right sound with it.It's just a very bad product.Avoid it at all costs!!!"
5,All Blues A Winner,"This album is one of the best recordings of the 70s. Light Blue by Ron Carter is worth the price of the disc alone. This music has made me an incredible fan of Roland Hanna,the pianist,who always played with great taste and marvelous invention. Great tunes and a clear bass presence in the mix."
1,Grundy is still a sloppy researcher and Aryans are not Arians,"To the review belowAny babe in the woods who's taken a 101 medieval history class where they teach Americans to locate the Danube knows the difference between Arians and Aryans. Grundy does, too; yet there are a few spots in the book where he gets carried away by the urwuechsigkeit of the latter word. Years later, I still laugh at his inclusion of Seyfudin in this book (scilicet: Properly Sayf al-Din, but here in pseudo-Turkic spelling means the sword of god and was never heard of east of the Tigris before the seventh century).Ach, this world would be so lovely if we all wrote Runic and Ogham script and the brown peoples who pester the four corners of the earth stopped bothering us..."
5,Hear it to believe it,This is a very simple way to maximize the sound of your music. It significantly increases the clarity of your highs and lows. I used to have to keep EQs adjusted all the way on my mixer but not anymore. For $150 it is a easy addition to your system and can make even a budget system sound so much better. Absolutely love it.
5,Great book,I was concerned about how to teach my 6 year old on the subject. This is a great book. My daughter can read this book over and over on her own and we can have some great discussions. I would recommend this book to my friends.
1,Kids Don't Need to Know Those Words,"I saw this book in the library where I am student teaching pre-schoolers. They use all the ""politically correct"" words for private parts and it's disgusting to think that kids need to know those words. Why won't ""private parts"" suffice? There shouldn't be books like this. Parents can easily tell their kids, ""Don't let anyone touch your private parts"" and be done with it. There especially shouldn't be books like this in a school. All we need is for 3 and 4 year olds going around the classroom saying those words."
5,body privacy,important to my 6 year old niece to understand privacy without upsetting her. She swims and undresses outside with her parents and when other family is over strips the same way and it was becoming uncomfortable for me and her mother trying to get her to understand private versus public--it is very innocent and we want to protect innocence but keep her safe and appropriate.
5,sweet book,I bought three books of this kind. This is my childrens favorite. I as an child abuse survivor myself find this book to be the best of the three. This book is about giving the child a sense of ownership over his/her body. An entitlement to say no. it is written from the childs POV which comes accross very well to my children. This is a gentle book with a supportive mother figure. I realize that it may be uncommom or unrealistic that one should have such an in tune and supportive mother and that there may be other flaws. Yet it is gentle and the child finds success in standing up for herself. It is still my favorite. I like the way it couches the responsibility to say no on the child but that the child has back up or confidence with the mothers support. The book begins with small things like personal belongings and knocking. This book has a senitive approach and a nice pace. It gets the information accross without threatening a small childs mind.
4,Sounds nice!,"The sound from this device is pretty good, if you do not need strong volume. With just the inconvenience of cables."
4,Very good for the size,I've got an older Sony SRS-T77 portable speaker system and my brother received the JBL On Tour system for Christmas. We compared them and the JBL hsa a much fuller sound and also cranks to a higher volume.
4,Good Times Bed Times,"This was a pretty cute romance-comedy. Paul Ko (Louis Koo) is a popular and handsome police officer who has a problem. Carrie (Sammi Cheng) is a reporter for a gossip magazine in which they want to let all their readers know whether or not the popular Louis Koo does or does not have this problem. Carrie receives the assignment to find out whether or not Paul really has a problem. The two hit it off pretty quickly.Raymond (Lau Ching-Wan) is a judge and has a past relationship with Carrie but because Raymond is caught cheating on Carrie, the relationship is broken. Raymond meets Tabby (Charlene Choi) during a trial case where Tabby was suing someone for sexual harassment. After Tabby meets Raymond, she tries to hit on him.All the actors/actresses did a good job and they appear quite believeable. The story also flows pretty well. This movie is worth watching at least once."
5,Secrets,"Yesssserie! If you get this book, you won't put it down - errr - only to go find your partner!!!!"
5,The best so far on this topic,"A long well written book on that shows how after the failure of Soviet invasion, Afghanistan descended into a battlefield where countries and movements with different ideologies clashed with their respective agendas.Although after reading this book, I am not so sure as the writer suggests that a more pro-active US policy have made that much difference in the country unless it was willing to send in ground forces."
4,"Along party lines,","As I write this I am listening to members of the 9-11 Commission reading and quoting from this book. It seems our fellow reviewer from Sag Harbor, who doesn't have the fortitude to sign his/her real name, has a lot of criticism for those who do have the courage to act. If, as this character from Sag Harbor suggests, the book is as poor as he states, why is the 9-11 Commission interested in it enough to include it in the hearings? If you have watched any of the hearings, read this book and put the pieces of the puzzle together, as far as it can be done at this time. I think you will find it goes well with the line of questioning on parts of the Commission hearings."
3,A Layman's Viewpoint,"I don't want to take away from Steve Coll's amazing scholarship and knowledge, but I found this book entirely unreadable. I've stopped and started it about 20 times. It's just so dry! Too many names, not enough narrative drive, and just sloooow and boring. I tried! I really did! I respect the writer and he is obviously a great journalist and historian, but I don't think writing is his strong suit. JMO.Also, I found it was way too descriptive and ""objective,"" just saying over and over what happened and giving us all these details and facts without much analysis or overall scope or theme. Maybe the style is just not to my taste, I admit.I enjoyed The Looming Towers so much more. Now that is a fascinating, readable, incredibly engrossing book. I've read it two times!"
2,Who edits the managing editor ?,"Despite favorable reviews, one might ask: who dared to edit this tome ? Seemingly no one. Coll is like a draftsman; heavy on detail, good red lines, straight right angles but weak on telling a good tale and moving the story along for the general reader. The reader does not need to know of all the feuds between the Afghan tribes and the CIA and the State Department. A David Halberstam would have knocked this book off in 350 pages, Coll takes another 125 weighty pages to tell the same story. The Washington set may call it the definitive history of the CIA's involvement in the Afghan War but it is questionable if the general reading public will wade through the book to the end."
3,If you are a policy wonk .....,"..then you'll love this book. Otherwise, this is a very dense book that you may have trouble getting through. It is extremely well researched and detailed (almost too much so). And it does demonstrate the political and social complexities within south Asia that our spy (and civilian)agencies must deal with. One thing that struck me is that, in spite of American's deep involvement with the powers in this area, we still could not prevent 9/11. An utter failure of our intelligence community, in my opinion."
5,This works with my Electric Yard Man YM137,"So, this attachment will work with any gasoline power unit.The Poulan PP1000E's modular design works with my electric Yard Man YM137. So, it will work with just about anything made by MTD/Troy Bilt, Ryobi, Craftman, etc.It's light weight, easy to control, very forgiving and has MORE than enough depth control. In fact, with the Poulan PP1000E, I have so much depth I could probably go with a smaller blade from the stock 7 inch blade.But, what is really cool about this edger attachment is that I was able to create the ultimate electric edging tool. With more than 600 feet of edging, I can knock it out in about 15 minutes at a walk with no muss, no fuss, no hard starting, no noise and no toxic fumes. It takes longer to clean the trimmings than to cut the edge. This beats the pants off those pathetic B&D; Edge Hogs. I love the YM 137 and I love it even more with the PP1000E."
4,Great edger,"I just used this edger for the first time yesterday, and it worked great. It did have a little trouble getting through the hard wet dirt, but to be fair anything would. I used to use a weed wacker to edge. Never again, this is so mech better and it cut a perfect edge down into the ground. Now when I go back to do it next week it will be easy since the slot is already there! It snaps on to my new Poulan Pro weed eater quick and easy. It even comes with a end cap that let's you hang it up when your done. Also there are no parts to assemble. Just take it out of the box and snap it on to your weed eater!"
5,Please All the Way Around,The edger arrived in a timely manner. It works just like it should. What more could I want?
3,Solid Edger missing barrier handlebar,"Great price for a solid piece of equipment. However, the product description says the barrier handlebar is included, but it wasn't in mine. However, I called Poulan and they shipped me one for free."
3,it is what it is,This attachment is what it is. It will supply you with a stick edger that works decent for the average home owner. It is heavy and therefor makes for an unbalanced peice of equipment. It does the job and I must say if you need an edger without spending a bunch of money it will do. I'm on a budget so I'll give it a satisfactory review.
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"I COULD CUT THE GRASS FASTER WITH A HAMMER, IS DULL, AND THE FLAP BEHIND IT IS USELESS, THE HIEGHT AJUSTER IS A PIECE OF, IT DONT WORK ANOTHER TONKA TOY"
5,Great tool,Product arrived on time and works wonderfully as an accessory for my Troy-built weed-wackier. It is easy to install and operate. I will recommend this product.
5,replacement blades hard to find,"replacement blades hard to find. most edger blades are 9"", on this unit standard and universal blades won't fit, so you have to spend $11 plus shipping to order their 7 1/2"" blades. another reviewer said he found 7 1/2"" blades are local mom and pops stores were you can find them. I called local mom and pops stores and lawn mover parts stores , Homedepot and Lowes, and looked on internet and can not find any edger blades that fit this model except the $11 plus shipping for Poulan. To make matters worse, the $11 blade wears out very fast. only worked one time on med size yard. would not recommend due to this blade issue.updated: finally found replacement blades at a different Lowes store, two blades for $10. so change back to five stars"
4,good hair music,"Has a few songs worth getting, recording quality is good, vocals and instruments played well. Some definite talent with this band. Glad i acquired this CD for my rock collection."
3,"The Versus, BradyGames, & IGN guide are a lot better...","After I read this book, it left a lot to my mind. There was SOME strategy, but not very much per character. Ben Cureton's, Versus Books', and IGN's guide were much better done, and they were all written by Tekken experts (especially Cureton, who is a three-time national Tekken champ). This book could have been written by my ten-year old brother. Avoid this and buy either BradyGame's book or (better yet) Versus Book's."
2,Kim Won Jin's amazing kicks are the only reason why this is worth a look,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's about a kung fu hooker who meets a female cop and they become friends. The cop and the hooker have to go on the run when they get in trouble with the police. This is basically just a bad exploitation movie. The only nude scenes have the lead actress fighting naked, and it's very distastefuly done. Literally the only thing worth watching is the 3 or 4 minutes where Kim Won Jin gets to show off his kicks. This guy is the best acrobatic kicker I have ever seen. Check out Operation Scorpio if you want to see the best of his abilities. He fights Lau Kar Leung.1.5/5Picture and sound quality on the Megastar DVD is good. The subtitles are decently written."
2,Real Disappointing,"Much of the book is given to explaining reincarnation to the beginner, and little to someone who has already studied the topic. There is a bit given to the early church fathers who believed in reincarnation, much to those who fought them, and only two instances, known by almost everyone by now, shown in the new testament. If you know the story of the man blind at birth and Jesus telling that Elijah had come again in the form of John the Baptist, then you would be better off trying another title, or better yet, the writtings of pre-Nicene Christians"
3,If you're in the mood...,"This book was a good read, when you felt like reading. It was helpful passing time, but the plot and the characters are shallow and confusing. It has a good ending, but I'm surprised I even got to it because the book's lethargic content drags on so. If you have time to waste, waste it on this. It has absolutely nothing to do with the ""Crusader"" or heroes."
5,"Well Written, Couldn't put it down!","This book is a new favorite of mine. It has a lot of great details. I can really picture what is going on in my head. I read this book day and night for 3 days until I finished. I couldnt put it down! If you like mysteries, then this book is for you. Don't accuse anyone right away though, things aren't always as they seem. This book has viloence, and deals with mature subjects (murder, racisism, death, etc.) If you can't handle things like that, don't read it."
4,Definitely worth your time...,"A really good friend of mine had let me borrow Crusader. I thought the cover was really cool and started reading right away. I have to admit the beginning is ssslllooowww. Several months passed by before I actually picked up the book again. Overall it wasn't bad. Very clever ending if I do say so myself. In fact, I LOVED the ending! lol Yep. But the book was wwwaaayyy long and it would have been just as good if not better if several unimportant parts were pulled out. It started getting very good towards the middle and better and better but yes the first part is pretty dull. I still recommend it. You'll most likely enjoy it."
3,"Good, but not on the level of Bloor's first novel","For anyone who may have read my review of Tangerine, I wrote that I was thrilled that Bloor had another novel out and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Well, I have read it now and have to say that I was disappointed. I wanted so badly to love it like I loved Tangerine, but it just didn't happen. I found Roberta to be a difficult character to feel for. I just couldnt get into her or identify with her, even though I shared some of her adolescent experiences of being shy, bookish, and slow to develop. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more if I hadn't had such high expectations for it, because I found the subject to be quite interesting."
4,This book challenged at my school,"This award winning novel by Edward Bloor was unsuccessfully challenged by a group of parents whose students attend my school. The parents objected to racism, violence and by the father's lack of morals.I read the book and thought it was great. The main character was the moral center of the book. Sure, everyone was making unwise decision around her but Roberta rose to the challenge and really, set everyone straight. What an empowering book for teenagers...."
4,Crusader- A Review,"I found this book to be very interesting and it reached a nice climax, but it was missing a few things. It did not, unfortunately, have a solid flow to it in the way I had hoped it would when I purchased this book. I thought Roberta was a very inspiring character, however. I thougt it was with great detail that Mr. Bloor described many scenes in this book. Four stars."
2,NOT YOUR BEST EFFORT!,"After reading the book titled After Dark, I was terribly disappointed with Island Magic. I anxiously awaited Island Magic and had it on reserve but I certainly could have waited. Cassie and Gordon worked my last nerve with their on again off again 41/2 yr. romance. Gordon needed serious therapy and Cassie was more patient than any one person should be. ""Bette Ford, I know you can do better than this, therefore, I won't hold this one against you."""
4,"Great Single, but expensive if u buy it from here!","Great double a-side single, but at $12.99 your better off buying the new double disk album entitled ""Finlines:Between the Lines"", which has all the tracks featured on the single plus 17 more. I payed only 11.99 for the double album from a local music retailer, hunt around for a decent price."
1,Worthless,"This thing worked for six grillings. Now all the temperature shows is ""Low"" and ""High"". I've tried everything and can't get a digital temperature readout. I think the wire to the probe must have malfunctioned. I put a new battery in it, but I'm going to take it out before I throw the dang thing in the garbage. I'm going to get a remote thermometer and it won't be Acurite."
4,prefer Genisoy cheese soys chips,"I have ordered both the zesty nacho and bold cheddar in the past. The cheddar soy chips have more flavor. I believe they are Genisoy bold cheese. These were fresh and crisp, great shipping, just the flavor was so-so."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED BETTER,"I HAVE TRIED THE DIAMOND IV FLASHLIGHT.ONE UNIT HAD A SWITCH THAT STICKS.DIAMOND COULD HAVE PUT ONE WATT LED INTO THE FLASHLIGT, SO THAT IT WOULD EQUAL SOME OF THE HIGH QUALITY FLASHLIGHT ON THE MARKET.OVERALL IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT WITH A LITTLE BETTER PLANNING AND DESIGN."
3,good for emergencies,"It takes a long time to charge this flashlight by shaking and the light is fairly dim by comparison with a hefty regular flashlight, but it's a good thing to have in your emergency kit,since you never have to worry about the batteries running out...."
1,No stars,"Never received product. Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec. 3 for Christmas presents. E-mailed seller several times to find out where order was, they never answered my e-mails.Good way to do business!!"
5,"Clear, concise introduction to OOP and VB.Net",This book is very well written. The material is organized well and the information is presented in easily digestable pieces.The book gives a nice overall background of OOP then shows how to implment it (on a very basic level) in VB.NET.I highly recommend this book for VB programmers who have never incorporated OOP in their programs.
2,This book is full of errors.,"If you are trying to learn the concept of OOP with VB.NET, this is a good book to start with. If you are trying to learn how to program OOP in VB.NET, I would look else where. I found the book to be full of errors. You can download a list of errata from Apress, but don't expect to be able to fix all of the errors with this. I spent more time trying to figure out why the code did not work than I did learning OOP. I know fixing errors will help you learn what the code does, but that is not why I bought this book. If I could do all over again, I wouldn't buy this book."
2,They'd fire me ...,"No way would I turn in code with as many errors as I found in the examples from this book. The approach to learning Javascript is good, it's just not backed up with any decent examples or exercises. Not recommended."
1,"Good for Housebreaking Beagles, Bad for Learning JavaScript!","The book begins by diving straight into the examples, without so much as a brief discussion of syntax. I found the example code was usually full of errors. It is not useful as a reference or a learning aid. I bought this book in London to read during the flight home. Next time I go back, I'm going to attempt to return it. Avoid the ""Essential XYZ For Web Professionals"" series like the plauge (or British Beef)."
5,ablsolutly loved,I got this for my boyfriend and he just loved it. He responded with a stare and then he tackled me with a huge hug. lol He couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it when I found this. I have never seen a yin yang pendant like it and I doubt I ever will again. It's amazing.
1,"worse, worser, worsest","Instead of just griping about the Maxell ear buds' deplorable sound quality, permit me to recommend a superior alternative.""Customers who viewed this"" set of Maxell ear buds would be better off listening to music/podcasts by pressing a stethoscope (check this website for availability) against the outside of any mp3 player.In a side by side comparison:Appearance - Stethoscope winsComfort - Stethoscope againDesign - same as aboveROI/value - give it to the 'scopeAudio quality - STETHOSCOPE, BY A LANDSLIDEBonus suggestion: Have your small children use these awful Maxell ear buds just for listening to music you want them to hate."
4,CAREFUL Unwrapping it!,"Don't get me wrong, for the price this is absolutely worth it but be careful taking it out of its packaging! There are little prongs on it that break right off if bent even slightly the wrong way. I took two of mine off when I opened it. It still installed just fine, no problems at all...but I freaked for a minute.Holds my new pioneer stereo without any issues! I would recommend this to a friend, for sure."
4,Great Aftermarket Accessory,"If you ever have the occasion to upgrade the stock head unit in your Saturn L-Series, you'll need this item to give your installation a polished look."
3,A little help is better than none,"I cannot give this product any more than three stars. It does help the sagging problem when sleeping on the pull out bed...but barely. It tends to slide downward quite a bit through the night. It also needs to be flipped every other time after use..because it tends to bend and stay that way. Also, do not keep it in the couch when not in use...put it on the floor underneath..or you'll have a really fun time trying to bend it flat again."
1,"Dumb, inane, ridiculous.","I flipped through a friends copy of this book (which he was given as a present) and we both laughed ourselves silly at this vacuous idea for a coffee table book. Who on earth would pay this amount of money for this ludicrous concept? Another example of the ""dumbing down"" of our society is the fact that books like this are published and that people continue to buy them."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought I was getting a good deal, but it was just a cheap product. Not the seller's fault, mine. I could have received a refund, but for this price, it would have cost more to ship it back than to just keep it. The customer service was fast and friendly, I just was not happy with the product. These tear easily, and they are difficult to get on the remotes. My kids wanted the colors, so I ended up just putting them on with the clear remote covers over them. You can barely see the tears, that way. Oh, and once you get them on, they slide if you don't put the clear covers over them. With the clear covers over them, they don't look too bad. The kids are happy, and that's all that really matters to me. I did want to warn those of you who might be a little pickier than I am. These are very flimsy, the nunchuck covers are difficult to get on, and the remote covers slide. which is exactly what they are supposed to prevent."
5,Very detailed documentary,"Like the History Channel, A&E always does such a great job with there various historical documentaries. The video gives a very good overview of the Black Death that swept over Europe and has a good price as well!"
2,"I know the author means well, but...","Unfortunately, this is a pretty bad book. The author means well, but that doesn't automatically translate into good writing. First, I think the book is too long; at least a hundred pages could have been cut. There is way too much time spent describing fairly meaningless action (like the 3 or 4 times on the outdoor shower). Secondly, the dialogue is not remotely believable--all of the characters are amazingly articulate on their innermost thoughts and sound like they're giving speeches, not having conversations. And thirdly, the plot of the book is both obvious and ridiculous.Some of the early scences between the two main characters are kind of sexy, which is why I'm giving this 2 stars rather than 1, but I cannot at all recommend this book."
5,LaserJet 4L on a Windows 7 x64 PC,"I'm a telecommuter, and I just received a new laptop from work. In order to continue to use my work horse, 20 year old HP LaserJet 4L (unsurpassed quality...HP doesn't build a printer this good any longer), I had to have a USB to Parallel adapter. I was familiar with the Tripp-Lite name, and I read the good reviews here so I didn't mind paying $20+ for quality.Out of the box, I connected the Tripp-Lite cable to the laptop and Windows installed drivers. It showed it as an unknown device. So, I connected the other end to the 4L...nothing. Then I disconnected the USB end and reconnected it. After a couple of minutes, Windows located and installed 4L drivers. The only way it could have been easier is if I'd connected the printer to the cable prior to plugging in the USB connection.I highly recommend this product!"
5,Jeep hard top hoist,This makes taking my Jeep hard top off an easy one man job!!! Its also nice to store the hard top all summer long. I have 10 ft. ceilings in my garage....I can park my wifes Jeep liberty underneath the hardtop. Its a hardtop owners must have!!!
5,"By far, best money spent ever on a Tejano CD set","Tejano fans, this two CD set is the very best live Tejano concert I ever heard. You can feel the energy of the band, the fans, the night, the area, it's LIVE, literally! Whenever I have to be on the road for an 4 hours or longer, this CD set goes with me regardless! If there was anyone who asks ""What's Tejano music?"", this CD represents it. Even the part where the lady fan says ""I want to give youuu a kiss!!"" and Jimmy goes ""Oh my God!"" and Joe goes ""Alright honey, a little kiss won't hurt no body"". I don't know nor do I care about the state of the band, but for one special night, on this night, Mazz were the King of Tejano and represented Tex-Mex with pride honor and love! Buy this double CD set, it will be the best money you ever spent!"
2,not what I thought it would be,recieved the Whynter Sno and read the info which had both heat and cool operation. When I recieved an only cool version and contacted the company they said they were out of stock of the unit I was expecting and sent a cool only version. Shipment cost were too great to send back and forth so I kept the cool version and bought a separate heater. Poor customer service to send the cool version when out of stock rather than notifying me of the issue and ask what my preference was.
4,Very good purchase,Have been using this player for over 3 years now and it has served me well. Picture quality is very good both on DVD and VCR. Only wish I'd stop breaking/losing my remote control :-)
4,Not for everyone,"This movie is without a doubt of the wall. Totally wacked and wierd, to be more specific. I first saw this ten years ago when I rented it and laughed my ass off. I recently bought it on Amazon and laughed myself into a near heart attack almost a decade later.If you get a kick out of practical jokes or enjoy tormenting people for your own gratification, then RED should most likely be right up your alley."
4,"7 Day Pill Reminder - Size Small - Clear, Blue or Green","Good product but smaller than expected. The seller should put product dimensions in the description. This item will not hold many pills, and if yuu have any large vitamins you will only be able to fit one into each compartment."
3,Don't Expect Too Much,"I love 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', so I bought this book thinking it would be just as romantic and exciting. Well, I was sorely disappointed. The characters lack depth and the story was rather thin. I would rate it as 'readable'."

4,As advertised. Recommended.,- Loos and feels good.- Made out of wood.- Light weight.- Fits a standard kitchen drawer.- Compartments of appropriate sizes and fits alot of silverware.- Makes organizing kitchen silverware easier.- Good price for what you get.Recommended.
4,"scary, to the point, no nonsense","This is so true to life, it really got me thinking about what is going on in the world. Watch this and be prepared to need to get prepared."
4,Where is Le War Lance now?,"I enjoyed the book, which, I read as a journalist's travelogue. I suppose that's what Ian Frazier had intended (and seems to imply at the beginning of the book.) Most of the book was quite good, though it may not have been necessary to spend three chapters (out of 15) on basketball. The author probably could have made his point on the basketball player in one chapter, while writing more about his friends Le War Lance and Floyd John. In the book, Frazier mentions that he and Lance consider themselves to be brothers. It would be interesting to know about what's been happening between them over the last dozen years since the book was published; a second edition of this book, or perhaps a new book would be a good addition to the story."
1,Belongs in Fiction category,"I found this book very disturbing; fortunately I read the paperback version and carefully read each footnote. This is where I discovered that the author had basically made up the entire SuAnne story. Consequently I found myself not really believing much else in the book either. I really got the impression that he didn't much care about the people on the reservation; he just wanted to be able to pop in and visit at his leisure, then leave again. It is an interesting book, but I suggest you read it with a heightened level of skepticism."
2,Not Practical,"The suggestions in his book are misleading. Not for the motivated young people who want to make a difference in the world. No one can argue with his conclusions about workaholics. However, no one is going to achieve much success with a goal of living and raising a family on $6000 a year. I read his book in about 3 hours - really a waste of time as far as practical advice is concerned."
2,"Big on inspiration, little on practical advice.","This book would be much more effective if it gave practical advice like 'Your Money Or Your Life'. There is little advice on how you get from one financial situation to the other and assumes perfect health (no reliance on health insurance)and diverse talents (able to get money only as needed). If you are in less perfect health, definitely give this book to a younger, healthier person."
4,Excellent Range and Selection of Italian Pop Superstar,Celentano is unique and that he is authentically Italian at the same time he wears his adoration of North American pop culture on his sleeve. I wish there were more if his English language songs on here but it's a great collection to add to my on the go mp3 collection.
4,Better than expected,"I own one other Kelly Willis CD, simply because I find ""Not Forgotten You"" to be one of the best songs there is. However, I was disappointed by the rest of the songs on that CD, but felt that maybe I should give Kelly another shot. I was quite pleased. These songs seem to be more polished than her earlier works. The music seems more rehearsed, the lyrics are orginal and beautiful, and her voice is a welcome change from many of the cookie cutter singers that seem to spring up these days. It may take a couple of listens to really get into it, but if you liked Kelly before this at all, I am willing to bet you'll be in love with her after hearing this CD."
2,"Not Comprehensive, Incomplete, Some Errors","This book is a mixed bag. It is a usable resource on non-Greek/Roman mythology, but is marred by the author's essays in regard to the Greek/Roman mythos. Baumgartner's views aren't necessarily invalid and may be an attempt at humor, but personal opinions and humorously incomplete writing have no place in a book calling itself a ""dictionary."" This is *all* she says about Perseus, one of the most-written about Greek heros: ""Son of Zeus and Danae. He cut off the head of the gorgon Medusa, who was minding her own business at the time, and gave the head to Athena. This disgusting homicide won him acclaim and honor."" Real funny, huh? It gets worse. This is an example of an error: ""Maia - Greek: Daughter of Atlas and Pleione. Mother of Herakles by Zeus."" Wrong. Should say mother of Hermes. Herakles' mother was Almene. Only use this book as a last resort. Buyer beware."
4,:),"Happy with my purchase. Came neatly packed, and as described. Only problem I had was there was a crack on the back of the case. Not big enough for the tacks to fall out but still a pretty nice sized crack."
1,Fell Apart Immediately,"I bought these gloves for my 9 year old. The fit was was good and they seemed well made, having a good leathery weight to them. He liked them because they weren't cartoony or too childish. However, the seam along the back, where the cuff meets the rest of the glove started to unravel immediately. The teal striped fabric has a loose weave and is not reinforced. The fabric basically shredded into fibers, leaving a gaping hole across the back of his hand just below the cuff. My purchase included two identical pairs. The second pair, before its first use, is already beginning to unravel in exactly the same place."
5,The fictionalized account of a true story,"The River Jordan: A True Story Of The Underground Railroad is the fictionalized account of a true story - the escape of the slave Jane and her seven children from a western Virginia tobacco plantation, on land once owned by George Washington. All major characters and events are not only real, but also closely researched from newspapers and documentation of the time. Careful attention to detail and powerful imagery bring this near impossible journey of hope and freedom to vivid life. Highly recommended."
4,Great trailer,"I have gotten so many complements on how cute this ""buggy"" is. The bike trailer is perfect for my kids (4 and 2) to ride in and they love it as well. Although they have to sit relatively close together it doesn't seem to bother them once we start riding. I did ALOT of research on ALOT of different trailers and I decided on this one because it looked more sturdy, has 20 in. wheels (for more ground clearance and smoother ride), has somewhat padded seats, and the seat is more substantial than some of the others in the same price range looked. It is also very easy switch it to a different bike because of the vice- like connector (verses the pin connector where there is a piece that has to remain attached to the bike even after the trailer has been removed). For the price I paid ($99.00- on sale, 50% off) I am very satisfied with what I got. I saw very little difference between this one and the ones that were very expensive."
5,great carrier,"My husband and I purchased this carrier about a month ago and we LOVE it!! We have 3 boys ( 4.5, 2.5 yrs and 10 months) all 3 have been in it and enjoy the ride. Have not had a single problem with the hinge, would never use it without the safety strap though. Super easy to put together and attach to the bike. No complaints and definitely a fair price. As for the space in it, our oldest is just over 40 lbs and the middle boy is 30lbs, when they ride together there is not much wiggle room for them, but I would not say they are cramped. All kids have plenty of room to wear their helmets in it. Hope this helps!"
1,Copilot Rollover,"I've been riding my 16 month old daughter in the Copilot for about a month and have been loving it. But, two days ago it tipped over when my bike cleared the curb while heading off the street and onto a path, but one wheel of the Copilot trailer carrying my daughter hit the curb and the trailer flipped to its side, the extra wheel hitting the ground, bending, but keeping it from rolling over. We removed the extra wheel, thinking it had caused the tip-over. My husband took baby girl out today and the same thing happened, one tire hit the curb while exiting the road onto a trail, and the entire trailer rolled over 1 X. Thankfully both times the straps and bars kept her from hitting the ground. We realize now that the joist that attaches to the bike will rotate 360 degrees when it needs to be stable. I am scared for other parents and wanted to share our experience with this product."
1,Awful,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend whose taste in books is usually very similar to mine. When I gave her this book back, I was tempted to punch her in the face.You can literally skip chapters and when you pick back up you will have missed nothing. There are at least 30 pages dedicated to explaining how an ancient indian tribe kept track of time. WHY? That has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Tim Robbins would start on a long, overly detailed, often nonsensical description of something, and I'd start skipping pages, only to find that 5, 6, or even 20 pages later when I tried to pick back up, he was still describing the same thing.I tried to get through it, but this is the only book I have ever been unable to finish."
1,Lack of Quality,"I was very happy with the quick delivery of my games, however, I am not happy with the quality. I have had the games for a few weeks and already the black paint is wearing off the dice dots, some of the cards are splitting, and some of the 1 dots on some of the dice are off center. I have emailed the comapny and the amazon company and have not received a response from either. It has been about a week since I emailed them.So, I am not very happy with the lack of customer service."
2,Not Much,"I read this book recently and the author seemed like a ""princess"" rich bitch trekking across Tibet on her parent's dime. She did run into some harrowing moments, but never seemed to lose her ""isn't it all wonderful"" attitude toward the people around her. I can well imagine the reason why the natives were so caring, she paid as she went and spoke as if the natives were naturally just so wonderful. Everyone you are giving money to is ""just so wonderful"" I would rather have read a book about the hard realities of these places outside the bubble of a insulated money'd post college girl"
1,Don't recommend this supplier,When it says remote controller kit that should mean kit not just the remote. when i pay the money for something like this and no sensor is sent it bull. so this company lies and i would not recommend them to any other future buyers.
2,Probably works well. Taste... well not so good.,"I like trying various kinds of energy drinks, foods and such, so I purchased a box of these based on the reviews.If you are running a race and need a boost, it would probably do the trick.As for taste, it's not ""bad"" persay, but it's not good either. The taste is exactly as you would imagine if you mixed strawberry jelly with artificial banana flavor and added a bunch of salt.Which leads to often, a pack of warm sweet and salty goo.While appealing to some, it never ended up appealing to me, as such I still have most of the box in the drawer which it will probably stay."
3,"product good, shipment arrived damaged","This product arrived 24 packs in a box. Two packs had leaks which caused a big mess upon opening. The damaged packs were identified and discarded. The clean up required gallons of water as the sticky gel surrounding most of the packs had to be washed thoroughly. I cannot imagine how the damaged packs could have been opened enroute, so the shipment must have left the dealer broken. Lesson learned, never buy bulk through the mail. It is too tempting for a unscrupulous dealer to unload damaged goods. So I saved nothing over retail cost by buying from this source. BTW: The gel taste great, that's why I gave it 3 stars."
2,Packaging makes it unusable,"I received the above product with 3 of the 24 units already leaking heavily. I figured that they burst in transit. No big deal, right? However, while cleaning the rest of the units I noticed, that with gentle pressure the seams were leaking very easily. One that didn't leak I took for a run......that burst in my pocket...no pressure applied as far as I could tell. Contacted the seller, they told me that ""this happens"". Wrote PowerBar more than a week ago, no response. I will not be buying them again.That being said, I was able to try 2 units. I love the stuff. The gel is thin enough to slide down a dry throat on a hot day. The taste isn't that bad, the citrus helps you salivate a bit to help it down. If it weren't for the poor packaging and horrible customer service, these would be my go to gels."
3,Not Bad But Lacks Muscle,"Magnum PI as Ike? Credit to Tom Selleck: his understated Ike portrayal is far more complex and engaging than the bland, amiable Ike conveyed by most Ike biographies. Selleck's performance truly shone.Generally, the film is evenly paced and provides a cursory but informative view of one aspect of high command in WW2. Yet it has flaws. For instance, the supporting cast is, frankly, somewhat weak (except for the splendid actor who played pesky Monty). The film also deviates from some plainly known facts. Bedell Smith is portrayed as a softie sounding board and feel-good chum, not as the ruthless, vain, and superbly efficient SOB he was. Putting those quibbles aside, the film allows an enjoyable, visual break for anyone tired of reading history."
2,Great for a couple of weeks,"We wanted a small pond in our backyard but didn't want to have to use electricity. I thought this solar fountain would be perfect, giving some circulation in the water, plus looking pretty. It did just that for a couple of weeks ONLY when in direct sunlight, but since then, has decided to quit working most days. I don't know if there is a short or what, but the fountain does not even come on most days now, even in direct sunlight. Unfortunately we threw away the box so I haven't tried to return/exchange it. I'm now looking for an alternative."
1,disappointing,"well, I must have gotten a defective one. I placed it in our pond which has full direct hot sun and it made lots of noise but didn't pump at all. I tried putting it in just a big barrel full of water to see if it would pump in that, and nothing. I returned it for a refund and won't try again, too disappointing. I have other solar products doing just fine in the blistering sun here."
1,Huge disappointment,"Simply put, this doesn't work well at all. It gets clogged up with the tiniest algae and even when it is working, the ""fountain"" is a joke. The water barely reaches 4 inches. It might work in a bird bath if it wasn't so huge."
1,Solar fountain,"This solar fountain has no battery reserve, so it only works in direct sunlight. The direct sunlight has to be pretty intense for it to even have a 3 inch spray. Do not buy unless you live somewhere with really intense sun, not ment for New England summers!"
2,Sloppy top,Not hard to install. But does not align when you close it. Not easy to remove. You must loosen hinges.
4,Goddess Initiation,"Everyone can use this reference in your lifestyle, easily adaptableThroughly enjoying reading and partaking of the wisdom of this author"
1,"Total disappointment: Winsome Wood Round Coffee Table, Espresso","The coffee table has a perfect size and design for my family room area. It is only 30"" diameter. The quality of this piece of furniture is simply unacceptable. There are deep dents and scratches which the factory finished over anyway. Quality control sure is lacking. If you decide to buy this coffee table, prepare yourself for returning it back to the seller as I did. Thanks to Amazon, I received very speedy replacement. I was hoping that the second table will be much better quality. Boy, I was wrong. I had to order 2 another (same kind) tables from Wal-Mart and from all 3 assembled one which I can accept. I would not recommend purchasing this coffee table. It is not worth $119.00 and tons of your time and frustration."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I found this item in other stors for quite a bit more. Even with adding shipping. And really I have a small car so fitting the monster box in it would have been a chore. Delivery was a great way to go. Just as pictured. Once put together is a tad bit shakey. I have some heavy books on it to stabelize it. I'm sure some wood glue in the areas that are screwed in would help that though. Really is over all a lovely piece and the parts on their own are sturdy, just use that glue to keep it solid."
3,Mediocre,"The wood has an uneven texture to it and the paint job is pretty slapdash, but if you have furniture that matches this, you should be satisfied."
4,winsome table,"This table took awhile to assemble. The manufacturer recommends 2 people to put it together, but it can be done by yourself. The bottom of the lower shelf was ""marred"" but it faces the floor. Not a big deal. It's one SOLID piece of furniture. Would recommend it...just be patient while assembling."
1,Wow.... Major disappointment :(,"I could not be anymore dissatisfied at the poor quality and terrible craftsmanship. I recently placed an order for all three pieces (coffee table, two tiered end table and three tiered end table). They were poorly crafted. Cheap quality wood. Pre-drilled holes were not even cut all the way through. Assembly took for ever because pieces were not cut correctly. I would not recommend the purchase."
4,I love Time Travel,And love-love-love this trilogy. Ma. Bretton is a wonderful writer who draws you in to the world she's created and you don't want to leave. Definitely a keeper!
1,Forumal writing,"20 pages of character build up. Then 20 pages of character sex .... I gave up at page 23! Been a trilogy I should maybe have given it more of ago, but why bother!"
1,yuck,"well darn it all.....this book started out great and I hated to delete it, but the sexual explanations were graphic....I avoid that kind of writing. Too bad, the author has talent and sure could have left out the muck."
2,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"read my full review here:If you're requirements for a horror film are blood, gore, death and gratuitous nudity, then Blood Oath might be the kind of horror film you can sink your teeth into...[...]"
1,Disappointed,I ordered these for my daughter-in-law for christmas this year 2012 and am very disappointed. They appear very cheaply made. The hoop portion of the earrings were bent and not smooth. I will not be giving them as a gift. I would not recommend these for anyone.
1,TERRIBLE!!!,Terrible resemblance! It stinks! What the heck? How could someone so vile and cruel discrimanate Legolas' skinny body!!!! It looks like he went on the fat world cruze! Is he on fat pills? WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chloe says what in God's name were u thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Meh,"The very epitomy of a 2 1/2 star, mediocre book.I was neither impressed nor appalled. It reviews South Africa from prehistoric times until after Aparthied. If you want to know some basics about South Africa, I'd read it. If you are looking for real in depth analysis, find something else. I would neither suggest nor disuade readers."
5,An exellant book!!,"The book was moving, funny, and sadeach 7 biography changed my emotionsI cried and laughed while i was reading this bookit was a wonderful story that i wuld never forget^^"
2,A MUST NOT READ,"I very much enjoyed Earth Song and Warrior's Song. I purchased this one based on the expectations that it would be at least as good. Alas, what a disappointment. I found Graelam to be an ignorant lout. Never have I met such a cruel, unfeeling brute who raped and humiliated the dear Kassia on the pretext that women are naught but animals to be used by their masters. I stuck with the book, mostly because Ms. Coulter does write well and because I liked Kassia and hoped she would find a real man to fall in love with. Graelam's sudden insight to his idiocy came too late in the book to make it worth the time spent - he will never be redeemed in my eyes."
4,Fire Song,"I've read all of the Song books, and I can honestly say that this is the most emotionally painful novel I've ever read in my life. I thought that the writing and the characters were great, but how this man turned from being so sweet to being a total monster and back again escapes me. I think if it had been me, Graelam would have had to do some serious groveling. All in all, though, I liked the book. It was interesting to see a villain become a hero in a sequel. I've always liked Coulter's books(though she can be a bit brutal sometimes), and I will continue to read them."
4,Beautiful dog collar,This collar is very nice looking. It has a beautiful pattern on it. It is strong and long lasting.
1,NOT FOR SI,"This product is not for SI models. It was frustrating to take apart my dash and find out this did not fit. I assume it works well for other civics, but I wouldn't know."
1,Doesn't fit my 03 Honda Civic Hybrid,"Couldn't get this kit to work with my aftermarket radio in my civic, so I am returning it. The trim piece fit nicely, I just couldn't get the radio to be at the proper depth for the screw holes line up. The instructions are worthless."
4,Interesting Piece,"Benjamin Weissman's ""Dear Dead Person"" is truly a very captivating work. His minimalistic style makes everything clear and concise although the events are so confusing and irrelevant. His book contains witty humor, horrific images, and quick, readable short stories for those of us who don't enjoy long novels. Check it out, I think it's pretty good."
5,Awesome!,"Excellent Saw. Great product, great price. Prompt delivery. I am VERY pleased with this purchase."
4,Cute socks,Comfy and cute socks. Perfect socks to go with a '05's costume. The poodle detail on the side is adorable.
4,I think this was great,"I was and still am a Twin Peaks buff, and if you like odd tv shows or like the show Twin Peaks, then this is for you. If you watch and notice in the last episode, Agent Cooper is warned many times about what is going on about him. END"
1,Not very useful.,"I'm already an experienced admin and I picked up the book for review before I took my exam.The book is misleading in a few areas and contains several pages of command output or config files per chapter that are completely un-necessary. They should've been truncated or the reader should've been encouraged to investigate the commands themselves.This book is also out of date as the current exam is for SLES 10, rather than 9."
4,The Man has a Plan,"In his book, Nelson McAvoy offers you a plan on how to teach young players the game of Soccer, rather then another book of drills. Unlike most books, he centers on the development of the child learning capibilities and how they learn to kick a ball. Then he explains how to teach it.Through a step by step procedures, he develops the laces kick, then the inside of the foot push pass as the child learns how to turn their foot.The book is filled with enough pictures, practice plans, and games to keep your youth team busy and learning in a fun environment.I would recommend this book for any coach who is looking for the long term development of the youth player."
2,One of the worst phone i ever used,i change my phone every 2 month so i ve tried a lot of phones and this is by far one of the worst. it freezes.. restarts for no reason.. applications crashes.. and when you call a computer service line.. e.g. when you call customer service and you have to choose different options.. the phone doesnt register that the line is connected and on the screen is just says dialing and it wouldnt let you choose any options..
5,Love it,This is one of my grandchildren's favorite movies. Well made and graphics are realistic. I would recommend this to others.
2,Singing is awful,Movie is eh- singing is horrible. Songs are reallllyyyyy bad. worst barbie movie we have seen. We like the older ones better
4,Entertaining for Barbie fans,"My daughters (4 yrs. and 7 yrs.) both love this move. They got a kick out of seeing Barbie's sisters too. Good story line, with a meaningful message. Perfect for getting your little ones in the spirit of Christmas."
3,Science of Sports,"The film of the science of sports/Rock and Roll was very interasting movie. It talks about how science is related to sports in some ways. This film can encourage childrens to work hard to achieve their dream. For example, in the film there is a interview of Michael Jordon how he became to be a world's best basketball player. When I watched this film, I actually liked it because the film was very interesting and they showed that education can be tought by having fun."
2,Wasn't what I thought,I thought it was supposed to be the entire version but it would only let my daughter play at minimum and wanted more money to upgrade to play other games on disc.
2,Uniden desperately needs a firmware update,"As stated before the router does split your internet connection. However, even if you do not upgrade your to 1.08 you still can network between wired and wireless computers.This seriously limits the function of a router. Instead this device should have been labeled as an internet gateway.Calling this device a router is a misnomer. Hopefully Uniden will address this issue.Because this product does have potential. If this issue was fixed I would give it 5 stars if you can buy it for less than 30.00.I think outpost had it for that price.Sincerely"
2,Cheap at any price,"The two best things about this item are that it looks neat and doesn't sound half bad. The worst things are that the main unit that plays the CD and has the controls and radio is considerably flimsy, it plays the CDs it wants to play, and having to figure out where to put the 50 lb sub-woofer considerably counterbalances the (optional) mount-on-the-wall, low profile gestalt of the rest of the system. Since I got it as a stop gap to play CDs while my beloved Denon Cellina is being worked on, I suppose I should be satisfied. However, I shouldn't have paid more than $40 for a machine that doesn't play every CD I have."
1,Just Stop Reading,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life. On top of the author being extremely boring, he can't even get his facts right. There were numerous errors in the book. The most blatant being the author stating that Mike Vernon won the 1989 Conn Smythe award when in fact is was Al MacInnis. Another error I found was in starting goaltending. The book says that Garth Snow started game one of the 1997 Stanley Cup finals, when in fact it was Ron Hextall. If I picked out these simple errors in the book, how can I believe any of the other information in it? The author and publisher should be ashamed of themselves for letting hockey fans read such a book. The author is a disgrace to hockey. Don't waste your time reading this book."
3,Golden Gypsy by Wanda Owen,When Dominique consented to be the hostess for the high stakes poker game she didn't know that her lush body would be the prize -- or that the winner would be the impossibly handsome Jared Barlow whose fortune was to forever crave the GOLDEN GYPSY.
4,Easy book to learn from,With or without a teacher this book is set up to teach yourself the Spanish language. All you need is motivation
3,great format -- tons of typos,"I have been using this book and find the format helpful. However, I have come across numerous errors/typos, which can be confusing for a beginning language student. Additionally, the CDs included with the book do not match the lessons. It is almost as if the CDs were made for an earlier edition and never updated."
2,mistakes and confusing literary translation from English,"I have been using this book and find the authors intentions good with the format, but the book is full of errors, grammar mistakes and examples, and exercises that seems are literary translations from English, which does not make sense.It had been a good idea that the authors had asked a Spanish native to read proof for the so many mistakes and errors, and literary translations that are very confusing for a beginning language student."
4,using in class,"I am just beginning a Spanish class, and this book is the text. I note that one of the reviewers said there are a lot of errors and omissions. However, my teacher is a native speaker, and I am not trying to learn on my own from the book. Therefore, I think the book is good for my purpose."
3,Spanish Now,Instructions of the exercises are not clear in some places and have to look t the answers to see what is wanted. The idea of Mexican spanish and Spain is also unclear in the lessons
3,Missing CD,"The text book is exactly what it was supposed to be. However, I find that when I got to my first class that there are two versions of this text. The other one has a CD so that you can hear the lessons. Your site did not indicate a choice and I received the one without the CD. That makes no common sense to me! So, I will have to drive to a physical book store and buy another book that has the CD."
4,Buy the one with the CD,"This is a good textbook for learning the basics of spanish...but I wish I would have bought the version with audio CD. So make sure you do that, and you will be all set."
3,Spanish Now,Book is good but for the stories they should have a section to translate.You just practice reading and speaking but no interpretation.
4,obscure hands of doom,"paul chain is a very underrated musician in the metal scene today,having been around since the seventies.His style is reflective of black sabbath,but paul is not content to merely imitate a style of music,so if you are bored and pi##ed off with with the cockrock trends etc that have permeated the stoner/doom scene,then try and get your hands on this(though you should start with alkahest,which is heavier).Apart from playing doom/metal,chains music inclues excursions into electronica ,and phonetic vocals which produce a sound that coul be described as dark psychadelia.."
2,great price poor quality,"I recently received this product and am disappointed. When I uploaded Images to my PC it turned out a little red. The display is just that, don't confuse display and viewfinder. It makes a great camera for your computer but not if you're looking to capture moments. Because of the battery save function it can be greatly time consuming when still-shot taking. If you don't really care of the quality and convinence, then this camera is for you."
2,Limited uses,"I got it as a service award from my company. Glad I didn't spend any money on it. It works as a web cam, or for posting pictures on the web (EBAY etc.), but not great as a camera. The auto turn-off is a pain, because you have to re-select all of your option once it turns off. It also beeps for each option you select. Animals don't like that. Seems to chew up batteries quickly, even when not in use."
2,NO NO NO Top Leaks after washing,"First, I would like to say I love Amazon.com for allowing us to post reviews, which has helped me so much in choosing my purchases.I thought I had found the perfect travel mug. After you wash the mug, you will continue to see leakage from the top rim, if you don't let it soak up with a paper towel, your coffee will taste YUK, not to mention, this is totally unsanitary. Also, the mug is top heavy, we have had a few spills. I am not happy."
4,"Snazzy looking, does the job but can't use with a straw","This cup is fine, looks good and doesn't drip. It arrived in a timely matter, well packaged.The downside for me is that you can't put a straw through the lid. I know that is very princess like but I really can't drink without a straw. Before I orderd it, I read tons of its reviews and looked at all the pics to see if the lid could fit a straw. Nothing said or showed it could not, so I took a chance.Otherwise, cute cup and keeps coffee warm for at least an hour. Passed it on to my mother who is happy with it."
4,Awesome brand,This cup is very sturdy and yes it's leak proof. I knocked it over on my desk at work and one tiny spot dripped from the lid. I suggest dabbing the lid with a napkin before you tumble it around after drinking. It keeps my coffee warm enough to drink for a few hours. The material is sturdy and it's a quality cup. I have only had it a couple of weeks I have noticed something another reviewer wrote about. After I wash it I store it upside down to dry. After a full day drying I noticed when I turn it back over its still damp inside. I believe water is getting into the inside rim hasn't posed a real problem yet but it might. That's the only reason I didn't give five stars. I love the construction and spill proof design of this cup I bought their cool cup tumbler as well. This hot mug will keep me caffeinated and the cool tumbler will keep me hydrated! I have been looking for cups of this quality for quite some time. I'm happy to have found this brand.
4,works great for a great price,I'm very happy with my purchase and it works better than the more expensive item i returned. The only thing I am not crazy about is that it appears on the inside chamber to have actually been painted to LOOK like aluminum. I am not actually convinced it is aluminum. It is made in China.
1,Love the way it looks and THAT'S IT,My pink mug doesn't keep my coffee hot for the two hours it claims. Kinda like a gorgeous but empty-headed guy - fun to look at but lacking substance.
2,horrible camera,"hmm...where should i start....the adjustment for macro/portrait/landscape is on the front of the camera and easy to forget about. the shutter isen't to fast, if your moving even the slightist amount the picture will come out blurry, so its not good for people without a very steady hand.as others have said, anytime you open the battery cover to change the batteries (it does go threw em like crazy) or the SD card, you have to reset the tiem and date. this isen't to big a deal since unless you really want to use them you can leave them with there default incorrect times. however, something that truely IS a pain, and very obnoxious, is that the picture settings revert to default EVERY time you turn the camera off. the default being medium quality and large size. which really sucks if your trying to max out the number of pics you can take.overall, its a horrible camera.the old bulky digital camera i had before getting this one was even better at taking pics."
3,Where do you buy an sd memory card ?,"I have looked everywhere on Amazon to be able to buy a sd memory card for the camera vivitar vivicam 3715, 3.3mega pixels, but not to avail. I am not very happy about that. Can you tell me how can a person purchase this accessory ? Regards, Trevor Moon"
5,Shes A Superstar!!!!!!!,"I been waiting soo long for Keyshia's cd to come out..First time I heard ""I Changed My Mind"" I automically became a fan so I had to buy the single from Amazon since her album wasn't released yet..This girl can sing with all her might & she is TRULY talented & isn't like no other..She has her own style & she is from Cali like me lol soo thats even better..The whole album is great she can't really be compared to any female artists today because she is just Keyshia natural & mos def gifted..Go copp her album lets make her go platinum"
1,Keysha Cole is a sucky ho,"When i finally bought this album for my younger sister, i practically vomited during the whole song. i listen to the radio all the time so i've heard ""I shouuld've cheated"" (That song was so whack! No wonder the guy is cheating on her) ""I don't love you no more"" ( the song was played out. Kanye West shouldn't have even been on the track. all he said was ""Kanye's on the track by the way"" kanye, i love you but, shut up! i've also heard ""the way it is"" Which is very sucky.All the songs have a fast beat that's kind of gay. Keysha, take my advice and throw in new tunes. Also, that hair has got to go, and you look like a ho in all of that itty-bitty wear.DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! i wasted $20.00 on that track. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! it is so incredibly whack!!----yawn---Get the bobby valentino album. he is sexy and hot and has a better song chart"
5,HOT Debut!,"This girl can SING!!! With the sudden outburst latley of these R&B; ""singers"" (you know who they are) - NONE of them can hold a candle to Keyshia! She can belt!She reminds me of a raspier Brandy (earlier stuff) crossed with Mary J. Blige. When Keyshia sings you can tell it comes from her soul and you can feel the rawness and the openess in every song. She writes and co-writes every song on this CD. There is not one song that I skip over on here. It is refreshing to hear someone that is singing/talking/writing about things that are relatable and relevant and not hearing things that are jevenile relying solely on beats to make the song.She has a few guests on here: Kanye West, Jadakiss and Eve but otherwise it is ALL on her. And she carries her own with no problems at all.Every single song on here is note worthy. This is the best R&B; CD I have purchased in quite sometime. It is a MUST HAVE! If she stays on the track that she started on she will be around for a LONG time!"
5,The Best,"This CD is why I started liking Keyshia Cole, almost every song is really really good. There's nothing else to say, just go get it"
2,"Call me a hater, but this girl sucks......","now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no ""Dangerously in Love"". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me.Aside from the obvious car banger ""I Just Want It to Be Over"" and the wildly popular ""Love""(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me. Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon."
1,Can NOT play online,I bought this for online play via comp to comp or via gamespy - neither worked. They say to disable your firewalls and everything else (which I've done)...and I am still unable to play a real person over the net.I emailed for tech support and they basically told me to contact tech support for my router.Playing vs the comp is fun and I like the graphics - but since I bought the game to play others online and can not...I give it 1 star.
5,Safe and secure,"This seat is easy to slip on and off and seems very comfortable for my 9 month old son. I love the fact that my husband can take a turn riding with him (with an additional rack purchased seperately). He always falls asleep when we go on a ride! The seat makes it easy to ride with him in tow, you hardly notice the additional weight. It is easy to load him onto the back while holding the bike. I like the easy to use strap and the safety bar that lowers in front of him. It also keeps him far enough behind me to keep him from messing with me when we are on our ride. It easily allows for his helmet too. I can't think of any complaints..."
5,Safe in a crash,"We've had this seat for a while. I always thought it was a good product until today. Now I think its a great product. After about 10 miles of cycling today, the rear wheel on my bike dislodged (no idea how it got loose) and the frame and derailer came down on the spokes. It felt like the back wheel had seized but it was partly sideways and I couldnt control the bike. So we hit the ground. I immediately turned around to see my four year old sitting quite unperturbed in the back. The combination of the seat belt, the guard and the sides of the bike seat, coupled with the helmet meant that everything worked as it should and she didnt have a scratch.Our bike is junk -but Im keeping the seat!Any complaints? - its small but I find the velcro foot restraints very annoying to get on/off. And there is a thumb-trapping danger when removing the seat, which I do a lot as we take the bikes on the car to go to fun destinations."
5,mother of three,"the only complaint I would have is it sits too close to my seat on my particular bike (schwin). The exta rack is a must if your spouse rides. It makes it a BREEZE to put the seat on another bike, done in literally seconds."
3,Bionnaire dehumidifier stopped working after 1 year,Worked very well until it broke after about a year. No replacement; no fixing; no support from Bionnaire.
4,Works pretty good,"I have had this product for about a month now, and it does a pretty good job. Don't run it on continuous, it will freeze up and spill all the water in your floor. I can have condensation on the windows, and it will not turn on, saying that the humidity level is low.It works great sometimes, pulling about a half bucket of moisture out of the air a day. I still recommend it because of the price and that it does work sometimes very well. It is large. It doesn't look that big in the pictures, but it is about 2' high, 1' wide, and 10"" deep."
2,BlueAnt Interphone,"We do a lot of offroad woods riding and the range ""in the woods"" is only about 50 yards. It's very easy to loose someone plus once you loose range the radios disconnect from one another and you have to physically reconnect them when you get close again. I would not recommend this product to off-roaders such as Enduro's, Hare Scrambles, or GNCC'ers. It does work well on an ""open"" Motorcross Track. The overall durability seems to be really good and the product is very well built. The audio is superb!! The range is our only issue. We were anticipating much more. Too bad they can't attatch an external antenna that runs up the back of the helmet or something. The range would be increased 10 fold."
4,Interphone works great!,"This is a product worth buying if you use a GPS, Cell Phone or want to talk between bikes or rider to passenger. The hardest part about using it is taking the time to read the instructions so that you can get it setup correctly. Once you understand how it works it works very well. I have used it with my Zumo GPS and iPhone without problems, battery life seems decent and the sound quality is very good. I recommend it highly. The only reason I did not give it the full five starts is that it takes a minute to get a feel for the various button steps required to sync with a Bluetooth device, sync between headsets and control volume levels, etc. Once you get that down it is a great product."
1,FAKE,This is not the original design. This is a bad knockoff. Research the net and you find Medina Sod on the back and a ABC Patch o nthe arm..
5,the dude bowling tee,great tee shirt. perfect for friday night bowling with friends. good experience with vendor. product shipped and received within just a few days of order.
4,DC Doom..l.a. style,"This cd is really good,its solid.If anyone has heard of ""Wino"",should already have heard or know of this now defunct band.This is the second record(The Evil In you And Me being the first).This came out when a time the alt.rock had the take over and that scene threw the baby out with the bathwater(anything remotely heavy was a real no-no).Lost Breed was a sword for the other side(along with the obsessed,cathedral,etc).All in all at the end of the day,its worth owning,and definately worth playing at a LOUD volume with a F@#k you attitude.RIP guys!!"
2,stuck at lesson #2,"I've been battling lesson #2 for 3 days. I found the infamous missing files that you need to complete lesson #2 from one of the other amazon reviews of this product(thanks for pointing me in the right direction, fellow reviewer!) I would follow the directions to a ""T"", but would continually come up short somewhere along the line. There are too many things left out in the lessons. Like you need to have something highlighted before you do a particular step. Anyway, I've finished lesson 2 three or four times, but my finished product still isn't quite right. I DO like the format of learning right on the computer screen, but when you hit a snag, there's no glossary to turn to. Or help section to click on. I think I need a beginners book on the subject, and will study the reviews on the various frontpage 2003 books offered in Amazon to come up with a good one for rookies."
4,Truly Berserk!,"This book has all the elements of fun--one author, who obviously loves to write children's books, one subject (HIPPOS) and counting and you have the ingredients for a fun book. My 6 year old loves Hippos Go Berserk! and is learning to read it. She loves the counting as well. This book is in our Boynton collection (we must have the ""Boynton Memorial Library"" by now!) and it gets read weekly. We have to rotate through all the other Boynton books we have. It's a very good book and I recommend it, for children of ALL ages."
5,To Love A Princess,"I love how Ms. Grasso has little cameo appearances by her characters from previous works. It's like catching up with a friend over a cup of tea. I found Princess Amber to be a clever character and one not willing to let her life be decided for her. She takes hold of her fate and wrestles it into a very happy outcome. Princess Amber is exactly what Miles the recluse needs. She bursts into his darkness and reminds him that physical scars are just boundries, and boundries she's willing to breach if he is. Together they travel the bumpy and intimate road of romance. In the end they triumph over their personal demons and challenge one another to be the best they can be."
2,"Useful, but not comprehensive","This is an oddball mix between a somewhat useful guide to experts on a broad range of topics, and a crass collection of phonebook-style advertisements that undercut the integrity of the information presented.About 85% of each page is taken up by advertisements, with the remainder being more traditional listings that are also paid for, I imagine.The fact that this information is derived from a ""who will pay"" philosophy instead of a ""who would be most useful to journalists"" means that the information is suspect. You might find what you're looking for (and will certainly find someone who will do), but you won't find a helpful set of criteria that governs who made the book.This book might be better than a Yahoo search in that you can hone in on the contact information right away (useful on deadline), but if you have some time, a Yahoo search is probably a better way to get the perfect source for your story."
3,Sleek Modern Design With One Flaw....,"This mug looked like the perfect fix for my travel and desk mug obsession, and I loved the sleek stainless-pink fauxe color. The stainless interior keeps coffee warm for a long time, and the cover forms a tight seal to trap in the heat.I should have looked at the picture closer, because there is one major design flaw, in my opinion. This mug does not have an opening on the lid, so you must either take the lid off and drink away, or drink, recap, drink, recap, drink, recap. I sip on an endless cup(s) of coffee all day long, and this feature annoys me to death. I bought it for the office, but will stick with my old ceramic and stainless Copco model. While not as heat efficient, it does the job and I can mindlessly sip away without taking my eyes off my screen to remove a lid. I'll save this one for lazy Sunday mornings at home."
4,"Good volume, practical and stylish design, moderately good at insulating","Good volume, comfortable handle, stylish design. Keeps coffee warm, but not as long or as hot as I had hoped. The lid fits nicely and tightly and is really necessary for keeping any heat in. The lid is also very convenient because you can carry a full hot mug around the office or home without worrying about spilling anything. Compared to a ceramic mug, this keeps coffee warm much longer (maybe 45 minutes versus 15). However, once the coffee (or tea) gets cold you can't just microwave it to warm it up again. The lip of the mug is a bit sharper than I was expecting. It is not rounded like a ceramic mug, but comes to a point that you can definitely feel. After my initial discomfort, I've gotten used to it. It has a non-slip rubber base. Hand-wash only. Overall, it's much better than any ceramic mug in my house, and this is now the only mug I use for coffee, but I do wish it insulated better than it does."
5,THE NEW INTERPRETERS BIBLE. VOL 11,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A STUNNING COMMENTARY OF ST PAULS WRITINGS AND A GREAT AND EASILY READ COMMENTARY FOR ALL LEVELS OF READERS OF THE BIBLE OR STUDENTS OF ST PAUL.
5,Excellent read and thoughtful...,This book was recommended to me by a counsellor. I could hardly put it down. Even after 3 years of Seminary training some of the principles and perspectives presented here were refreshing to my soul. Buy it and read it and give it to someone you love.
3,Thank you for dancers angle,"The only way to watch this DVD is to change the angle setting to angle 2, the ""dancer's"" angle. Otherwise you get an over-cut mess of head closeups and funny angles that make it impossible to see what the dancer is doing. I wouldn't want this DVD if I was missing the remote to my DVD player. Rachel and Shannon are AWESOME!!!!"
3,Need more tribal!,"The only tribal performers were Rachel Brice and Sharon Kihara - I wish there had been more! Besides those 2, I thought Sonia was great and the routine with the wings was very elegant. I'm more into tribal style so I'm not going to buy this DVD (I rented it on Netflix). If you are into cabaret you should definitely check it out though!"
2,fire the camera man,all the performers are of top quality but the camera man must not think the dancing is interesting enough in itself -perhaps he thinks he is making it more exciting changing the camera view every second-flitting from one position to the next to the next to the next is extremely annoying -the camera closes in to a closeup missing fantastic hip work or footwork -it is disappointing -misses a lot of the performers best work-would like to say to the camera guy just hold the camera still and let us see the subtlety of the movements-must be better bellydance videos out there.
4,Works good,"I bought this headset almost a year back. It is working well all this time.Initially I had some problems when I switched it off. My cellphone will go on mute, its because the headset has the same button for mute & turning it off. Then I followed the proper method of switching it off i.e. disconnect it from my cell & then turning the power down.It also got disconnected few times during calls, but that was very rare.Overall its a good one. The design is very comfortable & light, you won't even realize that you are wearing it. The audio quality is better than when I talk directly from my phone.I would recommend this."
1,Hello? I CAN'T hear you!,"Totally agree with other reviewers that point out the fact that the sound level, even at max volume, is barely audible. Completely useless in a car unless you press it uncomfortably deep into your ear AND hold it there. So much for hands-free! Why won't Nokia recognize this problem and either fix it or come out with a version that works?"
5,Left Behind,This is an excellent book for understanding the Biblical prewrath rapture and comparing it to current trends. I highly recommend it.
2,I remember my old VHS copy looking better than this.,"I'm glad to see this back in print and in DVD release, but come on now. I'd expect this quality from someone who dubbed their old videotape copy to a set-top DVD recorder, not from an official release. Also, this either didn't come from the original master or someone cut corners on PAL-to-NTSC transfer. Rent it from Netflix first and judge the quality yourself before you commit.The extra bit, ""Live At Leeds"" is so darkly lit that there's almost nothing to see. Good for a completist, I suppose. But since they didn't make this a dual-layer disc, I think ""Perverted By Language"" could have been spared the additional compression required to fit both titles on a single-layer disc.Caveat emptor."
3,Doesn't have caps.,"I really liked this thing when I was little, and I still do. The only thing wrong with this thing is that in the picture it shows caps with the cap bomb, but it doesn't really come with caps."
4,Adobe Premier Pro 2.0 Classroom in a Book,"This is a good lesson, but requires some basic knowledge of computer video digital editing."
1,What a disaster,Be careful guys and gals. This is only a MP3 player. It does not allow you to copy files (any type of audio) back to your PC!!!These guys are worse than the RIAA when it comes to copyright of audio files. Even audio files you created!Go look somewhere else for a storage/file transfer device.
1,Annoying DRM makes this largely useless.,"I bought one of these and ended up returning it in favor of the Yepp Yp-55. In essence, both have the same features, but I originally leaned toward this one because it actually included decent headphones (rare in any portable).The only problem (and one not mentioned anywhere on the packaging) is the fact that you *have* to use the included program to transfer files back and forth between the player and computer. The player will not accept files encoded using another program, nor does it act as a simple removable drive. Not too convenient, especially for those of us who use other operating systems and better encoding software.That said, sound was decent, although the included 'phones are still sub-par, and the controls were somewhat intuitive after a short learning curve. The big sticking-point for me, though, was being chained to iRiver's software to use this device. The Yepp had no such problems, so I've gone with it and been very happy."
4,Convenient and Intuitive,"This mp3 player has a great design in both usability and looks. There are a few points that did bother me. The latch to hold the battery is flimsy and I've already lost one battery while walking down the street. The necklace type design is convenient for walking but this device is not easy to run with. The FM tuner is nice but the reception isn't great. Although the USB is still 1.1, the transfer time is acceptable and the computer interface is fairly intuitive."
2,Not Reliable,"While I enjoyed the sound and small, sleek design of my iRiver MP3 player I will not purchase another one. After only 1 1/2 years from date of purchase the product no longer works. For no apparent reason it will not turn on. I called customer service and they were of no service. I was disconnected twice before getting any live person. I paid $149 for the player and really believed it would last longer that that. I don't think this company is all that reliable. iRiver needs to improve their products and their customer service line."
2,it was okay,"i got this about 2 years ago. when i got it, it was really great. about the fourth or fifth time i changed the music on it, the things that hook it up to the computer got bent and broke. i think that it is a waste of money and you should buy the ipod. it is a better value, holds more music, and is better made"
3,BROKE DOWN AFTER 5 MONTHS,"GREAT SOUND, EASY TO USE, SMALL, I LOVED IT UNTIL THE ON/OFF SWITCH WOULD NOT WORK. NOT UNDER MFG WARRANTY BUT I HAVE BEST BUY WARRANTY. IT WAS NEVER MIS-USED OR DROPPED."
2,Product does not Support Windows Media Playlists,"I bought this brought because it played WMA files and had 256 MB of Storage. Unfortunately, there is no support of Windows Media Player and I had to use the included software to load files. Not very practical (at least for me). I ended up returning it and getting the SonicBlue RIO S50. The S50 worked like I expected but only has 128 MBs of Storage."
2,Good features yet unpractical for loading songs,"I bought this product because it plays mp3 songs, it has FM radio, and can be used as digital voice recorder.Pros:- it is possible to record audio of the playing FM station- easy to move/select directories of songsCons:- When plugged into my computer (windows XP), it does not get recognized as an external USB drive. So, it is absolutely necessary to use the software that comes with the mp3 player- One of the ends of the USB cable does not seem to be standard connection. In case of misplacing it, there could be issues on finding a replacement cable"
4,BEST MP3 player yet!!,"This device is unbelievable! Dinky little guy, this player has more audio than any other of the four players I own. Runs on one AA cell, so you don't have to worry about internal batteries failing, and the short life of AAA cells. A very good price, on a very good product. I haven't bought anything I was this impressed with in quite a long while."
2,Looks Good. Not Durable.,"It's a flimsy device. The power button on the one I bought a year and a half ago for 175 dollars broke this week. When I press it, the player doesn't turn on. These things weren't designed to last. While I did enjoy it when it was working, I don't think it's unreasonable of me to expect something so expensive to last longer than 18 months."
1,sensationalism,"This movie unfortunately is made with the intent to spread dislike of the Mormon faith and does not accurately portray it. I caution anyone looking to buy this dvd for the sake of ""learning"" about the Mormons because it's been found by independent reviewers to be ugly and not true:[...]"
5,Useful!,"This is a very useful accessory for the iPod mini -- it made an ""old"" ipod more fun to use!It's good to have vendors that sell older no-longer-carried accessories for ANY electronic item."
4,My Head Hurts.. in a Good Way,"I don't normally read books... I'm more of a magazine, short story, newspaper type of guy. In all honestly, Like Askew was probably the first book I have picked up in ten years, and once I did pick it up, I couldn't put it down.This urban fable takes place in an environment that I am sure I know, with a main character and his world of friends, employers, co-workers, and acquaintances that must pass on the street everyday ... maybe I even sit next to them on the bus-ride to and from work. Barry Fitzsimmons has created a world and story that I familiar with, intrigued by, and sometimes a little frightened by.If your world is filled with people you don't understand, people you like for no reason, people you loathe for no reason, and people that you love with all your heart yet can get so angry at, Life Askew will entertain you, disgust you, make you question yourself, and probably make your head hurt.. but in a good way."
5,A Must Have for Nutting Genealogy Enthusiasts,"This book was written by Reverend John Keep Nutting, and was originally published in 1908. It includes 9 generations of descendants of John Nutting, who came to the colonies from England in the late 1600s and founded the town of Groton Massachusetts."
4,Does what it should,"This fits myOster Classicjust fine. It is great for a quick one person smoothie in the morning. Basically just blend and go!Instructions (since the description is vague):* Throw all your ingredients into the cup.* Screw your own blender blades right onto the top of the cup. The cup is threaded to fit most blenders.* Blend* Remove blender base* add the lidThe lid isn't perfect. The opening flap can get in the way when you are trying to sip out of it. A straw fits well into the hole, though, so I recommend going that way.It also comes with a shaker ring for breaking up protein powder etc, but I use it for smoothies so I can't comment on its effectiveness."
4,This one takes the lumps out,I bought a few shaker bottles of different brands but none got the lumps out - but this one did - the only thing i don't like is thatthe top does not fold all the way back for drinking - it hits your nose and to get the bottom of the liquid out you have to turn and do your best - but still like it
3,Seems they changes the threading...,"I'm wondering if the threading got changed, because my blender is the standard regular mouth mason jar threading... but with these bottles, it leaks like mad!! I'm able to use regular mouth mason jars just fine on my blender, but I wanted something I could take with me out the door. To avoid as much leakage as possible, I ""seal"" the top of my ingredients with yogurt and that seems to keep most of the milk and things in, but not all the time.I'm now looking into some of those personal blenders... I think I'll just give the three of these bottles that I bought to my husband for his protein shakes..."
4,Nice but fragile,"The mare and foal are lovely, realistic, and great for pretend play. However, the legs are rather fragile and thin enough that they're next to impossible to repair. Be prepared for breakage if they're actually played with."
1,horrible shipping,"This shampoo came in a box with no padding or tissue, with scotch tape over the top of the bottle, that had ripped and there was shampoo everywhere. It was a huge mess and a lot of this expensive product was wasted. I would ask for a refund if I had any idea how to to do so. It was packaged so unprofesionally it was a joke!"
3,so-so,It doesn't lather well. I think there are cheaper brands that do just as well. Mrs. Wm Mitchell.
4,rubber band,The service was outstanding the product was as described the only reason I gave them 4stars is becatuse they seem to be a little flimsy.
5,Great way to relive the Glory Days,"This DVD is exactly what it's described as - network broadcasts of the 3 Super Bowl victories of the Washington Redskins. I know other reviewers want other games included as the ""Greatest"", and I think the 1982 NFC Championship victory over the Cowboys is one of the greatest, but these are the Super Bowl victories. If winning the World Championship isn't the greatest, then what is? No need to rate down this set because it doesn't include such-and-such game. For what it advertises, this DVD set delivers. Audio and video quality are what should be expected, and while the games are slightly edited, I didn't feel that it took away from the games at all. Pregame player introductions were still there, and there was a little postgame footage as well. I'd searched in vain for Super Bowl XVII, and this is by far the best one around."
3,Collection of selected papers.,It's a good start point. Don't expect to have a very well organized body of knowledge. It is just a selection of some important piece of work. Most of the papers are available in IEEE and ACM digital libraries.
5,Great product!,"This item is exactly as described. I do agree with a few other reviews in that the picture is a bit deceiving - the item is in fact two pieces that lay over eachother to create one single second seat floor mat. Just do the research to ensure it will fit your vehicle before buying. Overall, I am very happy with the floor mat! Very durable and matches my Tahoe perfectly! I have already had a co-worker buy the same set."
5,A Great Guide,"This guide helped out so much with planning my ceremony. I was able to mix, match, and edit my wedding ceremony. I made it in the order I wanted, the length I wanted and the words I wanted. This book provides a great guide, great ideas, and the worksheets helped out alot. I went throught the book and made changes and notes and then my fiance went through it and made his own changes and notes. We both enjoyed creating our own personalized ceremony and ended up with exacly what we both wanted! From traditional to totally personalized - I reccommend it to anyone!!!"
5,My boys love it,"We bought this set as a present for my 3 year old. My boys (ages 3 and 6) play with the train track almost everyday. They love the bridge and mountain. The set has several trains and different types of track pieces. The houses, people and trees are cute but my boys don't really play with them. They do like the road crossing and boat. Best of all this set fit with other wooden track we already own."
5,A heavenly voice,A very warm and gifted voice. Our Lord said He would sing praises in our midst. A voice like Angelina exemplifies that promise.
5,Sennheiser E604 are in the house!,Sennheiser E604's will be on my drum tracks from now on. Flat out the box they perform...period. If you really want the Big Boy sound this is where you need to start. I've seen them in many studios and heard the stories of how good they track and now I know for myself that it's not just hype. These mics sound great! Get these ... you won't be sorry!
4,"""Mozart Babies"" is a must for parents with little ones!","I love the classical Mozart music. My little ones love to watch the babies dance and play, and the music is more beneficial to them than the usual ""kid tunes"".A refreshing change."
4,True images of Ecstasy!!,"I really enjoyed this story! One can come to expect great work form Bussey. The thing I liked most about this book was that it did not just concentrate on the two mean characters, but on almost ever character in the book. A really nice read, please go get a copy!"
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,I really like Ms. Bussey's writings and I was no disappointed with this book. This is a book that you will read and then read again later.
4,Good Steam Juicer,"I had this exact steam juicer for a number of years (my mother has had hers for a couple of decades) and I really liked it. I forgot it on the burner one time and melted a hole in the water pan. I ordered a new one to replace it. I would have given it five stars, but when using it for the first time the rubber hose broke. I was lucky I didn't end up scalded by boiling grape juice. I replaced the hose and it has continued to work great. So if you buy this product check the condition of the rubber hose before using it."
4,steam juicer,"This steam juicer worked well to remove the juice from elderberries for making jelly. The directions said that after the water started boiling it would take about 1 hour to remove the juice. It actually took about 2 hours to remove all the juice from 2-plus quarts of berries but there was no need to strain the juice from the berries as is done when the berries are cooked in water. One problem that could arise is the amount of clearance between the juicer lid and the bottom of the cabinet or microwave when cooking the berries. I had about 2 inches of clearance. My sister, who also has one of these cookers has solved this problem by using her steam juicer on the grill burner outside.Over all I am satisfied with this product."
5,"Easy to use, easy to clean!",Used this for some conchord grapes to make juice and then from there to make jelly. Amazing product. Creates very pure juice without any of the seeds or pulp. A little large so wouldn't fit on my double oven with range because the top oven was in the way. Works great outside on a BBQ with a side burner. An excellent way to get more out of your extra produce in the summer!
2,High quality but too expensive...,"Made with high quality components but still expensive for one 20-inch diffuser.Edge is a little bit thicker than usual. If you have $25 buck, buy something else such as 5-in-1. This product is not recommended at this price."
5,This book is awesome!,This book is awesome! I have received hundreds of autographs by using the addresses in this book...I highly recommend it!
5,Spellbinding!,Absolutely one of the best hours you could spend in front of your TV with the stereo operating at full impact! Her sense of style and performance are highlighted here in the more contemplative songs as well as the more full tilt numbers. The tracks shot in Venice are unforgettable as is Annie's smouldering beauty (believe it!) which is revealed in progressive magnitude as the music reaches the chorus. A true Diva and she shows it here!
5,Farewell to the World (Deluxe Package),"I bought this Farewell to the World (Deluxe Package) for a friend, and he is very please with the deluxe package."
4,National Guard at War,"This book told a story about a seldom-covered part of our military. It is written from the perspective of an active duty Captain (son of the ubiquitous Scott Dixon) who is assigned to a Virginia National Guard unit in order to quickly bring it up to speed in order to fulfill a mission in the Middle East that apparently only a Guard unit could handle. It gives a godd insight into a side of our military that is seldom written about as a novel, rather than a ""history"". Having served in both the Regular Army and the Guard, I was impressed with the more personal face this novel put on an entire unit- a subculture, as it were, in our military.Having said that, I was not impressed with the plot; I cannot believe a semi-raw unit of any kind would be sent into a political powderkeg like duty in Israel involving confrontation with the local Arab terrorist infrastructure. Biological warfare, especially a strain of Ebola? Please- Clancy handled that plot awhile back..."
3,Not his best,"While I generally like Harold Coyle's writing, this is not his best work. It's not bad, and it is topical, but it could have been better.He spends a great deal of time impressing upon the readers the different thinking of National Guard troops compared to regular and reservists. Don't get me wrong, he does an excellent job at this, but he could have reduced the number of times he brings up the subject.My second complaint is that nothing really happens until 3/4 of the way through the book. Harold needs to go back and read his own book, Team Yankee, which is probably the finest of the cold-war era military novels, better than Clancy. In that book, things start happening with a few pages, and the action never stops. Here, not so much, as the current hip phrase goes.Lastly, the book stops, it does not end. Most books come to a well-written ending that wraps up the story. This books just stops. It tries to end, but fails miserably.I think Harold really needs a new editor."
5,ACDelco 215-364 Air Pump,"Item was as described but supplier was slow in responding to a phone call as the wrong part had been ordered. I wanted to exchange it but due to their slow response, I ended up ordering it from another supplier."
5,A Grim Interpretation of classic Poe,"This is a must have for any Poe fan!You may already own the stories here, but it's worth it for the art alone. The classic stories combined with Gris Girmly's artwork are truly amazing.There was one particular image I recall from reading The Fall of the House of Usher that was such a loving tribute to Vincent Price it really moved me. In fact, I ended up writing Mr Grimly an email to tell him how much I appreciated his work and to ask about the possibilty of a companion book which he hinted was in the works. You can tell he is also a fan of the material."
5,Flashlight,If you want a very bright light this one is for you. For a little flashlight it has the brightest light I have ever seen. The price is the best a round !
5,Useful flashlight,I walk my dog in the early hours and feel a bit more safe with the E2D in my possession. I know that the bezel both front and back will allow me to defend myself. It has a solid grip perfectly fit for my hand so the likelyhood of dropping it is lessened. The bright LED is a good first step towards warding off trouble. I am truly happy with my E2D.
2,USB cable,bought for nokia phone with memory chip and essentially useless. It works but it has its own unintuitive software. Buy the memory card and card reader. I think it works much better.
2,You get what you pay for,"This cable functions fine (at first), but it probably won't hold up to everyday use. I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck, making the cable worthless. Sure it's dirt cheap, which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable, but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping, I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items. I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I would give this product NO STARS at all but the minimum was 1 star. This cable broke the day after I received it! One of the prongs just fell off! Well I guess the old addage is true, you get what you pay for..."
2,wrong item,"i had received it in good time, but the item was not the right one even though the website says it fits my make and model of car. I contacted them and was told i could return it, but it cost me as much to ship it as it did to buy it so needless to say i was sol."
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased this video to use in my classroom. The quality was very poor. This video should have been trashed as you cannot see the picture.
3,More suited for Hard Style Martial artists,"This book was presented as a ""graduate-level"" course for martial artists. As a long-time Aikido practioner, I found almost all the concepts in this book consistent with basic level Aikido concepts- for me, there was nothing ""advanced"" about them. Perhaps martial artists trained in a hard style art will benefit from reading this book. But for those trained in a ""soft"" art, it will seem remedial. The last two chapters on Asian Weapons and Real World were outstanding, living up to the ""graduate-level"" billing."
3,poor insturctions,"Instructions to use are not written in plain english. No I'm not stupid I do understand you put this in the tray and press play. But there are 7 tracks on here and only one is supposed to line up the brush to clean the head. But you'll never know unless you listen to the whole disc and even then it never says ""THE CLEANING PROCESS IS BEGINNING NOW"". Others I have used say just that."
5,Guided To Enlightenment,"R. Keith's genius wraps the reader's psyche in gossamer threads of thought. Beautiful images, hard images, images of pure joy and sorrow simultaneously celebrate the beauty of our world, yet warn of the consequences of man's abuse of the earth.More than a travel log, Keith invites us along on his personal journey of physical and emotional discovery. As we travel with him, the glory and sorrow of existence glow, then burn white hot. Read this book and grow!"
4,Eye'd Buy This Book,"Who has been murdering prosititutes in Dallas and removing their eyes with surgical precision? Where are the eyes? This fast reading paperback cuts through hard-to-understand scientific and legal jargon and tells a story that keeps you turning those pages. Despite its title, the book is not gory but an interesting diversion into the dark side of a serial killer who collects unusual souvenirs of his conquests."
3,SCI-FI,A good story and I read them all. that's the reason for the 3 stars or I would have quit in the middle of the first. The author needs to take more care and have a good proof reader correct the stories.
2,"Forget Palos Verdes, more like Beverly Hills 90210","I currently live in,am raising my children in, and grew up in, Palos Verdes. I do not know what Palos Verdes the author is referring to. I bought this book as a quick read while giving blood at the hospital. That's about the depth of it."
3,litter maid,So sad that this is your only option if you have a littermaid. They are very expensive and are supposed to be used once. I can usually use mine a couple of times before I have to throw it out. Just spray lysol into it between uses.
1,Not as easy as it should be,"It's a good concept but the tray is poorly designed and does not fit into the automatic litter box easily. It is also difficult to remove the waste recptacle once it is full. Because the lid does not securly fasten to the receptacle, litter tends to fly all over the place as you attempt to remove it. Yes it's nice not to have to scoop the box every night but it certainly can become a messy ordeal once the receptacle needs to be changed. This product is also very over priced. It's just plastic."
1,You only need about 3 of these per year,"Save your money and line the receptacles you receive with your LitterMaid with cat pan liners. ...you can get 40 liners as opposed to 2 of these receptacles, and it actually makes disposal of the waste easier."
2,Does not fit LitterMaid exactly,I've tried all kinds of automatic litterboxes. The LitterMaid gets stuck often. These boxes do not fit as well as the ones that came with it. A nonautomated litterbox has worked best.
5,hard to find article,"I bought the LitterMaid litter box at WalMart and they no longer carry the product. As this model must be no longer made, it has been difficult to buy the replacement receptacles. As usual, I found it on Amazon.com. Thanks, guys."
1,Crushed,These items just like the ferret tubes I ordered were also crushed in and we had to crush them back out to try and use them. Luckily it didn't put holes in them.
2,Movie is good but its not original :(,"Got this movie I have been searching for a long time, the only thing that is bad to me is the quality of the video, it is a copy, doesnt look very good, you must specify it in the product details"
3,Anne Mather,"The affair between Rachel Williams and Jaime Shard had been over for years - but despite the bitterness she felt about Jaime, Rachel was still fond of his parents, and when they invited her to spend Christmas with them she could hardly refuse. But she had not realized that Jaime would be there too..."
2,Be Prepared!,"I viewed this film on a pre-release DVD edit and thought it was well put together for such a limited budget. There are some technical issues regarding uniforms and equipment that a purist historian will have problems with, but considering the majority of extras are World War 2 reenactors who receive little or no compensation, one can easily overlook these issues. The acting isn't that good and the story moves at a terribly slow pace, but cast members attempt to provide convincing portrayals of US soldiers fighting in 1944-45 Europe. Would this film earn any major awards? Probably not, but if you accept it for exactly what it is, a low budget independent film produced outside St Clair Missouri, then you will enjoy your viewing experience."
4,Muy Interesante,"Creo que es una excelente fuente de información. Lo único malo, es que uno se queda con mas ansias de seguir leyendo. No se que pasa, pero la juventud de este tiempo solo está en escuchar todas estas porquerías que los ricos nos están vendiendo, en lugar de leer y estar actualizado con informaciones valiosas como éstas. Porque estos ricos tildan al Che y las personas que piensan como él de comunistas, no sabiendo que ellos tenían verdaderos pensamientos cristianos. Porque ningunos de estos oligarcas están viviendo el Evangelio."
3,wish there was more information,"The author of this book has a funny little story to tell about a fragment of her life as a navy wife, but I wish there would have been more information, rather than her talking about how she cries everytime her husband leaves. The story is cute, but not very informative."
3,So So for a Novice,"I haven't played in years and years and this particular item didn't renew my interest. I guess I expected better graphics and clearer tutorials. Perhaps it's just me, but I've already uninstalled it."
2,Printed Upside-Down!,I bought this last week and need to use it (mark in it) today or I'd send it back. The whole thing is bound upside-down. These are expensive commentaries and the best in my opinion (the real product review right there). I've never had anything like this happen before but I'd expect the manufacturer to check something this basic before passing the item along. Now I've got one really weird commentary in the series.
5,You get your money's worth,This was a very good DVD. We were extremely happy with the performance they gave and the length of the performance. The Whispers certainly gave us our money's worth. I would recommend this one to all our friends.
4,Even Now,The book is new and am plesed with it with one exceptoin---it did not have the group discussion questions which I needed. Other books have those questions. Don't know why this one didn't.
3,Well.....,"I'm a big Karen Kingsbury fan, don't get me wrong. And this book had much to like--engaging characters, good pacing, an honest attempt to show both sides of an issue. And the first part of the book, a long flashback, is mostly excellent. However, when we get to the ""present day"" of when the book was written, the plot becomes a bit contrived and unbelievable. I still enjoyed it, but I was making myself suspend disbelief--and certain scenes and dialogue were so contrived I had to quickly skip over them. This may be because this book deals with a hot button issue, and though I could tell Ms. Kingsbury was sincerely trying to understand the position she doesn't hold, hot button issues aren't her strong point. But I do give her points for trying, and I'm glad I read the book."
4,Smile through the tears,"This book is full of woven interlocking family misunderstandings and broken relationships. A young couple is seperated by their parents and a baby is left behind by a teenage mother. You'll laugh, smile, and cry as this story unfolds and your heart will both greive and rejoice along with the characters.Karen Kingsbury brings her characters alive through their emotions. Yow won't be able to put this book down until the end, and even then you'll be wanting the next book of the series.Ever After (Lost Love Series #2)"
5,Sweet.,"What can I say, Amazon always comes threw when it comes to the prices. The product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived. Not to mention this is a great movie."
5,Stable and great for accessories,"I purchased this stand to replace a very old folding stand that was unstable plus I wanted the shelf for storage. The stand is very stable and the shelf is just the right size to put reading glasses, rosin or a pencil. It was also easy to assemble and it was packed for shipping in a double box so it arrived in great shape. I highly recommend it."
3,It looks good,"This baker's rack looks good, but isn't very sturdy. If you're going to have it on a carpeted surface it may be a problem. It's actually more like a plant stand than a baker's rack due to the open-bottom shelves. If you don't want to spend a lot, then this is definitely your best bet."
2,Not more but a short overview,"This book actually covers most topics concerning hostage rescue. It is well written and easy to read.But it doesn't offer any details, just some short overview.E.g. it deals with hostage negotiation for about 3 pages, whereas I got a professional book that has almost 300 pages just about this topic.If you are a professional already, or if you will rely on many other sources of information, than you should consider buying this book in order to have a nice summary of all main topics.But don't get the idea, this book alone will help you doing your job - it'll be lethal!I personally am really disappointed and will send it back to amazon!!"
5,Perfect replacement,"I've had this coffee maker for 15 years. Somehow the stopper that stops coffee flow when removing the coffee pot broke after so many years of use, and I started shopping for a new coffee maker. I did not like any of the coffee makers out there, and I was glad when I found a replacement filter basket. The coffee maker now works like new."
2,One for the shelves,"I am a die hard Indigo Girls fan but I was really olet down by this album. It was like they didn't even try. Their sound was as good as ever but they had no poetry, no soul, no...feeling. It makes me quite sad really."
3,Stand Together,"""Despite Our Differences"" is a good disc. My favorites come in the middle. ""Rock & Roll Heaven's Gate"" is the repeater in my changer with its rock & roll punch, ""And the wind may come & the rain may fall, but we stand together or we don't stand at all."" On either side of that track are my two favorite Emily songs on this set. ""Run"" boasts a distinctive melody and strong vocals. ""Lay My Head Down"" plays like a sonic waterfall with a darker lyric, ""She leans back against the wall & she watches, tugging her collar like it might be a noose."" ""Three County Highway"" is another favorite here with Amy writing at a slower pace. While I personally prefer the bite of Amy's two solo sets to the Indigo Girls, this is a good set with special moments. Enjoy!"
4,Tracklisting,"Great indie-pop from Sweden similar in sound to The Cardigans classic early releases.1. Obsession2. Always Someone Else3. Playboy4. Unheavenly Position5. Night People6. Magazine Connection7. Even If I Like You8. My Boyfriend Was A Girlfriend9. Last Night10. Camera Girl11. Rocky Boy12.

1,Not only wood - particle board & MDF,"I had to return this kitchen upon arrival. If you are looking for a wood kitchen, look elsewhere as most of the parts in this kitchen are MDF and particle board. Due to formaldehyde emissions, I don't think MDF is ideally suited for children furniture or toys. If you don't really care however, the kitchen colors are very pretty and the build looks quite sturdy."
5,Excellent Entertainment!,We got this kitchen for my 1.5yr old. It was really easy to put together (good instructions and everything was labeled well and color coded) and it is in our living room. It makes a great play place but also still looks really classy in our main living room. My daughter has LOVED it from day one and will spend almost an hour by herself just playing in her kitchen.
3,Dinner is FINALLY served!,"This kitchen is wonderful for the price. Our toddler loves it. However...we did not love putting it together. The main piece you start with was backwards from the written instructions..so we had to take it apart and come up with a different route. Everything is marked though and has plain, easy to read instructions. Just hope things are marked correctly!"
4,kitchen,It is a beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - I boughta lot of food and stuff to go with it and she gets a total kick out of it.The microwave plastic came cracked and it was so involved putting it togetherthat we didn't bother un assembling it and sending it back.
4,"Fruition is OK, but.......",This animation is good but somewhat too drawn out. Parts of the movie make one want to yawn... You can also get the item brand new WITH shipping for [...] total from the FRUITION web site......I would never purchase it for the price here......
4,Good buy!,This is a good representation of Custer and the Little Bighorn. Presented both sides of the story and varied viewpoints on Custer.
1,Pretty bad...,"If you're looking for concise explanations and helpful examples, please DON'T pick this dictionary!!! Extremely unorganized and un-helpful, there's even a ""supplemental list"" in the back of the book as if the authors suddenly wanted to throw in more words and didn't know where to put them in or something..."
1,waste,"please don't waste your time and money on this dictionary. it's not sufficient for any sort of serious use, and if someone is just using it to look up isolated words, a combination of hans wehr and google translate is just as effective."
3,A mindless show to enjoy,"No one will ever confuse Blood Bloods with great drama, but as a mindless source of entertainment it excels. The actors stay true to their characters and never seem to grow or mature, and I doubt that they ever will."
5,More than just car chases and gunfire,"It is easy to like everyone on this show, and it never disappoints in providing a depth to its episodes."
1,More trouble than it's worth times 10,"I was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player. I am even a bit technology oriented, so I thought it would be a breeze to set this up. Unfortunately, the player would not read any of my region one dvds...even though they were not damaged in any way. I called Apex's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing...I hope that Amazon will let me trade it for a different, more trusted brand of dvd player."
4,Read the Manual!!,"I'm editing my review, because now I wish I read the manual before returning the player I bought for my girlfriend. The button on the remote to switch from PAL to NTSC was undoubtedly my problem.. now I may buy two! (my orignal review is below:)Great feature list, poor reliability. Output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections, and with no v-hold.Thankfully amazon has free return shipping!"
4,Well worth the money,"I will never use all the ""whistles and bells"" this machine is capable of. But for what I do use it is perfect. I was, however. somewhat disappointed that I could not ""hook up"" to my Sony Multi Brand Remote Commander. Small problem."
2,Customer Service nonexistant,I have not even used my new DVD player and already I am disapointed! I have been trying for over a week to contact Apex. They will not respond to my emails (Promised turnaround time is 24 hours) and the phone line is constantly busy. All I am looking for is a rebate form!!
1,Garbage - Constant problems reading DVDs,"Simply put, the low price isn't worth the trouble. I picked up one of these to throw in a spare room and it constantly has trouble reading DVDs. Many of the DVDs I use nowadays are from Netflix and this player fails to read at least half of them. It doesn't do so well on the DVDs I own either.Save yourself the trouble and just spend a little more money."
1,Full of glitches,"Terrible piece of equipment. Will not display JPEG's properly. Background music for slideshows is distorted and frequently does not read disks that are read by other players. My advice, ""you get what you pay for""."
1,DO NOT buy this piece of junk,".I purchased this unit 3 months back and I think the unit knew when my warrenty expires. It is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what I do. I can only hear the sound. I changed video cables, tried connecting to TV on INPUT1 and INPUT2 but no help.I think you get what you pay for stands true."
1,Don't Buy!,"I bought 2 of this model for Christmas presents and neither one of them work! It is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working. One stopped working in February and the other in March. Amazon has been working with me to refund my money, but they reminded me that I have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return. I have had great experience with Amazon, but I will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems."
1,Works intermittently,DVDs that work on other machines won't load on this machine. Sometimes it will take 20 minutes trying to load and then will reject the disk. Sometimes it skips large segments of a movie that plays fine on another machine. Not worth the trouble!
1,We had problems,"The DVD player does not work properly. The player usuallyplays DVD's, but has occasional problems such as: 1) not recognizinga DVD 2) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we playedit 3) not being able to access certain special features on a rentalDVD. This has happened with several different DVD's and occasionallyif we keep trying something, it will work when it did not work onetime before. After we discovered the problems, we tried to contact Apex (fkor 3 months), but we never got in touch with them.The Customer support telephone number is always busy, and they do not answer their web customersupport."
5,The book to get if you want to write to a celebrity!,"2002 Deluxe Celebrity Address List is a no-nonsense, up-to-date reference of more than 13,000 addresses of movie, television, and sports stars, as well as politicians, authors, models, directors, world leaders, religious figures, and more. Many celebrities will respond to autograph requests, making this a first-rate easy guide to expanding one's collection of treasured memorabilia... 2002 Deluxe Celebrity Address List is the book to get if you want to write to a celebrity!"
4,not bad for the price,"I bought this product on clearance at Sears about 5 years ago. It still works great and has a very clear picture, although I prefer to use earbuds for better sound. Don't know why so many other people got such a short lifespan out of theirs, although I'm extremely gentle with portable electronics...I know they can stop working if you drop them once or even jolt them slightly. It works great for power outages to have something to watch, but the battery life is only about 1.5 hours per charge (not long enough to watch a movie). Luckily I was able to find a spare battery pack a couple of years ago."
1,Breaks Down -- Warranty No Good!,I agree with all the other comments about this product not lasting very long. Ours worked fine for about a year then suddenly stopped playing for no reason. I called customer service and was basically told I was out of luck!
1,Poor Service,The battery never held a charge. Sent message to customer service and never received a response. Wouldn't recommend this product or company.
1,Teachers: don't bother with this one,"Just wanted to echo the earlier review... fortunately I didn't pay anything for this video; it was given to me. Still, it's not worth the price. Not only is it deadly dull and the talking heads overly pretentionous, but the piano music is the most annoying background music I've ever heard in a documentary. I wouldn't even think about showing this to my high school students."
2,She wrote this for herself,"In an attempt to gain a realistic view of marriage, I gravitated to this book. I was intrigued initially. The excitement soon fizzled. The best parts of the book were the excerpts from those that were interviewed. I took offense to the author's attempt to place homosexual relationships under the same banner as marriage. This book lacked depth and variety (economic, racial...)"
4,Yes. this is good...,"and I believe the words are real. They resonate inside me. I feel their truth. It is not easy. I also found strength reading the novel Defenders of the Holy Grail. Sometimes we must move through anger, judgment, revenge, etc. before we move into love, an unconditional love, the kind Agori writes about"
4,How Stalin managed to outmaneuver so many,"I agree with those who wrote that Montefiore's voluminous ""Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar"" is not always easy reading. But it is certainly worthwhile for the light it sheds on relations between Stalin and his close subordinates, those whom he liquidated and those who survived him. Stalin's methods of domination--both brutal and ideological--are skillfully described. The same applies to personal relations between communist leaders. The Soviet Union was the first country in which the idea of proletarian dictatorship, formulated by Marx, was implemented. That is why all aspects of Soviet history are worth studying. Be aware that the number of characters is unusually large. Fortunately, Stalin's family tree and the introductory section entitled ""List of Characters"" should help readers to deal with this problem.Ludwik Kowalski (see Wikipedia)Professor Emeritus,Montclair State University, USA"
2,This is not a biography I would highly recommend.,A rather tedious book. I found it to be difficult to follow. Chronology not clear and the author likes to use rarely used words for no good reason. I was constantly using a dictionary to understand what he was trying to say. It appears that plain English is not the objective here. I have read many biographies but this is not one I will finish. On to another book on Stalin.
2,I tried...,"I really tried. But this book is just too poorly written.Yes, the author did his homework.Yes, all the different little-known facts make it an interesting read.But the problem is that Montefiore writes as though he has ADD : his mind is all over the place and is unable to stay on the main subject, the storyline. Not to mention that at times the writing is just plain odd. To the point that I can't read the book without getting thoroughly annoyed.And as mentionned in other reviews, he skips over some of the facts that he SHOULD be talking about.Therefore, I unfortunately do not recommend this book. Being a historian and doing your homework isn't enough : you have to be a good storyteller, heck, a good writer too. And this is what is missing in this book."
4,Nothing that wasn't in the previous releases?,"At a glance, it would appear there won't be any episodes in this box set that weren't in the Image releases of several years ago. As a ""Naked City"" lover, I got each of those volumes as they were released, I have kept them all, and I do rewatch them from time to time.Disappointing if you're like me and have wished for a complete series set, or at least the complete hour-long episodes. I would buy them all over again if they were part of a complete set (hear me, Madacy?)That said, this set does look like a great deal for the price if you don't have these already. Four stars for the content. Very highly recommended ... a great slice of early 1960s attitudes and styles. Thoughtful dramas, terrific looking on-location scenes in New York City, inspiring music by Billy May and Nelson Riddle ..."
4,Very entertaining movie.,"The great cast make this movie genuinely outstanding. Nicholson and Hunt, in particular, are truly superb. The script is well crafted and, at the end, one is aware that one has viewed a hugely entertaining film."
4,Way too cool of a saw,"This is my first worm drive circ caw and i tell you what this puppy can actually cut a straight line unlike the regular side winders. It is heavy and you can feel the torque when you fire this saw up. I ripped up 3/4"" ply all day with the factory blade and it was flawless. Only complaint is the cheap plastic handle I can see that will be the first place it will crack, I will just have to becareful when storing it...doesnt effect the performance of the tool...if you dont have one go get one tell your wife and your girlfriends you need this saw!!!"
5,Elated,"Very light saw. Good power to weight ratio. I don't have a tablesaw, but this saw is doing its' work in the mean time."
4,QUITE INTERESTING NOT DETAILED ENOUGH,"PACKING FROM THE SHIPPER VERY GOOD ... AND TIMELY RECIEVED THREW THE HOLIDAYSVERY SATISFIED WITH SERVICE . MOVIE I LIKED IT BUT WASN'T IN DETAILED ENOUGHHAD GREAT FACTS, BUT SLID OVER ALOT OF LITTLE FACTS THAT MAKE A ALOT IN DIFFERENCEOF HISTORY THATS BEEN RECORDED. SO OVERALL I LIKED WHAT THIS FILM DID PRESENTOUT TO HISTORIANS AND THE PUBLIC. I GIVE IT A GOOD RATING"
3,"Nice costume, but my son won't wear it.","I purchased this Tigger costume for my son who even chose the costume himself. He's only 2.5 years old, but he knew exactly what he wanted to be for Halloween. Unfortunately, when the costume arrived, he didn't want to try it on. It's been hanging in the closet ever since. I am hoping to get him to wear the costume on Halloween so he can go trick-or-treating.As far as the quality of the costume, I was expecting the fur to be much softer than it really appears. It's not the same texture as I was hoping. It almost feels like someone threw the costume in the wash and the fur became crinkled and warped.Needless to say, I definitely splurged more than I had intended for a Halloween costume, but I hope that it won't just be sitting in the closet like it is right now the rest of the year. It would be nice if my son considers wearing it for fun throughout the year such as during pretend games, dress-up, etc. We'll see."
4,Excellent system for $100,"You won't be able to do much better than this unless you spend close to $200.PROS:- The system does an excellent job with Dolby Digital and DTS on DVD's.- The DVD player plays just about anything- You can play MP3's from a DVD-R- Although the Aux input only uses 2 channels + the subwoofer, it sounds great.CONS:- No Dolby on the auxilliary input (so TV broadcasts and VCR tapes coming through on Aux input will only use 2 channels).- No SVideo input (I still have to use my switch box since I use my PS2 with SVideo).- CD / MP3 playback tries to emulate Dolby, and doesn't always sound that good (because of this, I'm still using my old CD changer on the aux input, which sounds awesome on the system, but it would be nice to hear it on the rear channels too).Still, you wouldn't get the features I'm complaining about on any other system in this price range!"
1,"Great!, for a week. Then it broke.",Worked great for about a week and then just stopped working. Nobody seems to carry them anymore which makes me suspect they had a major design flaw that the manufacturer does not want to recall?
1,model 2372-01 Skil Electric Ratchet Junk,These ratchets are so bad that Skil discontinued them. I have had eight of them and still didn't get a good one. When they charge they get very hot. After a week or two one of the batteries goes bad and something burns up on the circuit board. I took one apart and connected 7.2 volts to the cell input wires and it still didn't work indicating that something else failed also.I like the concept of the small electrical ratchet but the Skil model 2372-01 is not worth 2 cents. Bosch makes them for Skil so I don't know if the Bosch model is any better.
2,Problem is in the design,"I bought this tool because it was on sale at a drastically reduced price, and I have had good luck with Skil tools in the past. When I took it out of its box I was impressed. It had a nice heft to it. The first time I used it I think I discovered why they reduced the price. The problem is in the design. If you just pop on a socket or screw driver bit, most of the time the body of the tool or your hand will be interferring with the wall or whatever else it is you are working on. This can be somewhat mitigated by adding an extension to your tooling, but this can be awkward. Also the tool runs at a pretty slow speed. I have decided to keep it and put it in our utility room for use inside the house on small projects, but it will never be one of my favorites."
3,"I loved it, so I bought 4, Two months later 2 are already dead","I bought two of these on special at Home Depot and I thought they were great. I thought I had ""lost"" them and so I bought two more before the special expired. That was in the last week of February and now just a little more than two months after purchasing these, two have just stopped working in the last week. They have a full charge and the charger light is green, but when the button is pushed...nothing. They were not abused or treated badly in any way. I kept them charged. I know they have a one year warranty (I have to send it to them at my cost), but I had never expected to use it. And the fact that two of the four died makes me wonder if it's not an isolated problem.And it's really too bad, because before they died I would have rated these as one of the best tools I have ever owned. They are far superior to a portable drill for so many jobs. I hope Skil replaces the problem ones quickly."
1,Not worth the money or the trouble,"I have owned the ratchet for almost 8 months and used it on a daily basis and have had nothing but problems with the ratchet randomly not working. The battery is charged, but it seems to have a problem with the switch that activates the motor. I disassembled the unit to have a look at the switch and possibly install a new one only to find that the switch is soldered to a circuit board. So its not a simple switch replacement. The ratchet is fantastic and a real time saver when it works. but overall a total waste of time when you need to use the ratchet and it stops working while your in the middle of an assembly job and have to stop and dig out other tools to finish your work. I have read on many other tool websites about customer complaints that the tool just stops working. It's a real shame the tool just lays down and dies. I would say i have used the ratchet enough to have paid for the original cost, but I won't be purchasing another skil ratchet any time soon."
1,Absolutely Worthless!,"Most worthless tool i own. no torque whatsoever, doesnt hold a charge worth crap. do not waste your time or money on this product. mine is sitting at the bottom of my tool box."
3,"Skil 1/4"" ratchet","Has great speed, quite a bit of torque. There is a thermal circuit breaker in the tool that limits the motor's torque. If you lay it in the sun it will not work. The heat from the sun kicks the circuit breaker. I keep mine in the shade or air conditioning so I won't be disappointed when I go to use it. The circuit breaker is self resetting. In spite of limitations a pretty useful tool. Maybe I will open it up and bypass the circuit breaker!"
5,Nice addition to the tool bag.,Good for light to medium duty work. Feels solid even though it's pretty lightweight.
1,was nice when working,I HAVE YET TO SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON THE MARKET......LOVE THE IDEA .......MINE BROKE AFTER A MONTH OR SO........WORK ON SMALL ENGINES AND IS PERFECT FOR FITTING INTO TIGHT AREAS......BROKE AND IS NOT REPAIRABLE......BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR A YEAR OR SO......BATTERY STILL WORKS........LOL
3,I wanted to love it...,"...but I don't. I mostly just use it to hold vegetables, etc, after I've cut them up - it's pretty much worthless as an actual measuring cup for liquid ingredients, because it doesn't pour very well at all. You end up with a large portion of whatever you were trying to measure spilling all over the counter. I thought that maybe the one I got was defective, but then I saw the same thing happen several times on Iron Chef, so I know it's not just me.Incidentally, I also have the 2-quart measuring cup and it pours perfectly."
3,Very misleading description,"The description of this product is deceptive and misleading: ""PURELL 3659-12 Instant Hand Sanitizer, 12 oz (Case of 12)"" You actually only get 1 bottle in a bunch of useless packaging. They overcharge for shipping and send you 1 bottle. Very dishonest."
2,Don't waist your cash,I purchased this VCR/DVD combo two months ago because it was an inexpensive way to have the benefits of a VCR and a DVD player. The DVD player quit working last week.Don't waist your money!
3,Alright in a pinch,I got this item several years as a present for my mother.First - The description said you could record the DVD to a VHS tape...NOT TRUE atleast not with out some surgery inside the case.Second - The thing began to eat tapes within a yearThird - The DVD literally burned the plastic coat of a disk on christmas eve of year 2...then began to scratch every disk you put in it.Total piece of garbage...Wish I had spent the couple more bucks and just gotten a good brand at a Big Box Store.
1,Where's the music??,"No stars!! I just received this as an early Christmas present. I'm taking it back! I tried 3 different CD's, and the ONLY sound each time was a scratching noise. Hitting the Stop button didn't do any good. I just had to wait for the noise to stop on it's own; then the ""disc"" message came up. All 3 CD's were waaay off-center when I opened the CD compartment."
1,do not waste your $. buy the sony. orange@ cream,This is by far the worse sounding boombox ever!!!!!! where is the boom?????????
2,Nautica 2 quart glass pitcher is a bust.,"I bought this pitcher to be used for drinking water often and through out the day. Either this pitcher was not designed to be used much or there is a fault in the design. Within 10 days of use, a stress fracture is forming in and along the junction of the lower part of the handle and the base. I gave this product a generous 2 stars because it is attractive, the spout pours very well and it holds the perfect amount of water in which I like to drink per day. I would not recommend purchasing this pitcher, however, for the fact that it is heavy and the weight may be too much for the handle to handle."
5,Great book of culture,"This is a great introduction to world cultures for young children. It is written quite appropriately for children that are beginning to lose their teeth. My daughter loved the use of foreign terms. I also liked how the culture was woven into the story, such as how all they ate out of one large bowl and slept in bamboo beds. We also enjoyed finding Mali on our wall map and tracing the route they took to get there. Lastly, I think that it's important to note that this is a true story.I do want to mention, however, that one must realize that this story may certainly stain a child's belief in the American tooth fairy. I personally opt for straightforward honesty in this area, but some who want to draw out the fun for their child may want to avoid this book."
4,Great story and illustrations,"Since I, too, am from Portland, OR, I enjoyed this story even more, and I loved the illustrations."
5,"Fun aerobic workout, not too taxing",I thought this was a great beginners belly dance workout. It keeps moving so you don't have to keep stopping between different exercises. There is not a lot of real dancing but you do keep moving.
1,Do not waste your time or money.,This tape is very dangerous. They do the whole work out barefooted. You will be jumping around hurting your knees and ankles. The tape has nothing to do with bellydancing. I would recommend the Basic Moves tape if you want a good bellydancing tape.
1,Worst Workout ever,"First of all, the twins are not talking during the entire video, instead its a narrator barking commands in a very strange way. ""Now left, now right"" very very annoying. Add to that the moves are extremely repetitous and this is NOT cardio in any way, the only way you will ever lose weight is if you are 400 pounds and the bare minimum will help you OR if you are 75 years old. Everyone else should steer clear of this workout it is HORRIBLE."
4,Good for beginning work outs!,This is a nice cardio-workout. It is not the most difficult but in 30 minutes you definately work up a sweat. It might be good to review basic moves before this video.There is a warm up and a cool down. The actual work out leaves my shoulders feeling tired (I am only into this about a week.) just like when I was learning veil work. It also helps you to learn to isolate and combine some moves -- which can be helpful!I think the quality of the video is pretty good. However I think their sensual belly dance videos are great! This is purely for the workout value not for dance. Look for the others if you are wanting to learn a dance.
4,Great workout,"Easy to follow, a little more instruction on the moves would have been helpful. Good overall.Provided enough workout to create sweat."
1,Bad Product,I was not able to play this in my dvd player I could only get it to work on my computer.
4,Lots of fun,"Wow, Bellydancing is harder than I thought it would be! This video is fun and gets the heart rate up--and talk about isolating your hips and abs. I found it easy to go at my own pace--move fast/slow depending on the move. If you are not into repetition however, this video might not be for you."
4,A refreshing way to workout,"This workout is a completely new concept for me! Although the workout is almost completely non-impact, I still worked up a sweat and felt like I'd gotten a nice workout. I am newly pregnant and looking for a way to keep my abdomen in shape without doing situps, and this video will work perfectly. Veena and Neena are so graceful and beautiful in the video and pleasant to watch. The production quality is much better than other workout videos I own as well. The 30 minute length is great for a busy mom like myself! I highly recommend the video for anyone wanting something new, refreshing, and easy to accomplish."
3,Fluff,"Watch this movie for the live footage of von Richthofen, but not any worthwhile information on his life or who he was. Peter Kilduff in his book ""The Illustrated Red Baron"" does a much better job showing exactly who von Richthofen was and how he fit into his time."
2,Not a warm person in the family!,"I really didn't enjoy this story. The bad brother was miscast; I found it difficult to watch or listen to him. The story had no substance. All the family members were hollow; it was difficult to identify with any of them. I ordered Season 1, but will not order Season 2."
1,Dreadful,"This series tries to be ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" set in a hotel. While ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" was a remarkable social history, ""The Grand"" is a very bad soap opera. In fact, it's all bad: bad writing, bad direction, and bad acting. One dimensional characters, and a plot that often makes no sense in terms of continuity among episodes. Add to that audio problems that make the volume rise and fall regularly for no reason...save your money and buy ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" instead."
3,Not bad for the price.,"I have had this awhile and admit I bought this w/o researching as well as I should have. It plays fine, the only problem with it not playing discs is when they are badly scratched so I haven't had a problem beyond that. It is fairly easy and does most of what I want. What I should have checked before I purchased this machine is that it won't record one thing and let me watch another. So I will be checking those functions more carefully next time. If you want a fairly simple dvdr this one is fine."
1,"Junk: ""Disc Cannot Be Played"" error after 2 months","Worked fine for a month. Then it stopped reading some discs. Now it won't play anything. ""Disc cannot be played."" Even on brand new movies."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Works great and is nice that it matches my other Shun classics. I wish they had put the Japenese angle on 2 sides instead of just ones, but it's really not that big of an issue. Nice that it also has the Euro angle as I do have some of those as well."
4,Works great,"When I was growing up I remember my father using one of these but never really paid attention as to what he was doing. So when I finally purchased a good knife I wasn't sure how to keep the blade sharp. But after getting a whetstone and this my knives are now perfectly sharp and this keeps them honed between uses of the whetstone. It's a well made product, and works perfectly."
2,A tedious book.,"This looks like a first draft written by a bored author who was getting paid by the word. Since I only made it halfway through this book, I may not be qualified to comment, but opening a page at random just now, here is the first sentence I saw:For one thing any such discussion would have been between two men who were more than father and son since Scott Dixon was a very senior general who wielded enormous power within the Machiavellian world of back-alley Army politics and Nathan was a professional soldier who was expected to display the same sort of loyalty to his superiors that he expected from his own subordinates.Most of the book is like this - a series of trite, adjective-infested sentences limping painfully toward a predictable conclusion."
1,no more coyle books,I will never buy or read a Harold Coyle book agein after he killed off his hero LT Gen Scott Dixon he has lost the plot.
1,Must have been paid by the word,Coyle could have written an acctually interesting book if he had skipped about 250 pages. i read and read and read some more waiting for something resembling Action to occur. Only in the last 50 pages does anything even mildly interesting happen.
4,the rules rule,"I bought this book for a friend who was new to the biz. I thought it would be a funny gift but I started reading it. The ideas and philosophies where amazing. I'm a seasoned veteran of Hollywood and Broadway. I didn't think that I had anything to gain from this type of material. However, it was entertaining and enlightening. I strongly suggest this book for anyone looking for a place in the film industry or any form area show business."
5,My New Bible,"When I bought this book, I was prepared to read the words of someone who had watched Swimming With Sharks and The Player one too many times. However, this is not a book that teaches you how to be a player. This is a book that teaches you how to get noticed. You can tell that ""Anonymous"" knows his or her stuff about how to set yourself apart in Hollywood-- by playing by the right rules. There are insightful tips in this book that it would take three years worth of meetings to realize yourself. It is like the Hollywood version of Strunk & White's Elements of Style. Don't leave the east coast without it."
5,For Fans of Mk 1,"This is a mandatory purchase for loyalists of the original line-up. I promise you'll find something on here that'll blow you away. 'Why' did it for me. (If you don't, listen again. ;)) Not really like D&W; or MB, but an assortment of great earlier music.Also, there are two versions of 'The Landsdowne Tapes', a single disc and a dual disc."
3,Good for beginners...,"The history of Rome in only 50 minutes? They try and do hit the major points - important historical events, the Roman military, the great leaders, the Rise and the Fall, with some details to fill in the blanks. Good for a person with no idea about Roman history or maybe a World History class in which you needed to cover the history of Rome in one class. But for those of you with some knowledge, who have already watched a few DVDs and absorbed a few books on Rome, this may be a waste of your time."
2,Save Your Money,"Good news: Accurate historical information. Bad news: I was hoping this video appealed to high school students, but it is a snoozer...talking head after talking head, and some of them seem to be very dated. I watched it once because I paid for it, but I've not used it since."
3,Is there anyone more boring than a saint?,"...Lowe does manage to capture something here that very few ""political"" writers have been able to duplicate. If you're a political junkie like me (and it probably helps to be a Libertarian Republican as well), its hard not to relate to the novel's pure joy in the sleazy tactics used to win the political games. As one reviewer pointed out, Lowe gives us a portrait of hustlers and hypocrites, all out to advance their own careers at the expense of the common voter. And it is indeed true, Lowe wastes little time with remorse. However, as opposed to that previous reviewer, I have to say that there was something joyfully intoxicating about Lowe's lack of guilt. Aren't we all a little sick of guilt and earnest idealism by now? Is there anyone more boring than a saint? Luckily, Lowe doesn't give us a saint and that's the saving grace of his first novel."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Dodgy, deadly dames and manly male meatheads. Well, Dwight is not as dumb as all that, but he pretty much falls hook, line and sinker for the old slinking femme fatale routine. Those damned pheromones and all.All is not as it seems, except for the hulking psycho bodyguard type. He is exactly what he seems."
3,It's no... Big Fat Kill...,"For a graphic novel that has more artwork than words, it actually took me a while to read it. I tried reading a chapter a night, so it wouldn't be over like that. Overall the story is ok if all you are interested is in background information on the character of Dwight. And if anyone is a fan of the novels because of the movie, The story of Dwight will make some more sense after this is read. And know that this story in intertwined with the Marv story."
4,Herodotus,"This is supposed to be for a review of the book, not the rantings of consumer stupidity. Yes, it is a good idea to be sure of the contents of a book before buying. That's good sense. I own all the books but the older ones are definately falling apart. This is a nicely chosen compilation of three previously published dragonrider novels. These three stories from earlier Falls fit well together. Almost like a Pernese book of histories. I'd recommend it for any Pern lover, old and new."
2,No longer holds it charge,"I have owned two of these units. The first died and could no longer be charged after about a year. Thinking it was an issue on my end, I purchased as second unit which again failed about 18-months later."
3,Watch out - no auto shutoff,"I was looking for a walkman to play my old tapes.This one has auto reverse, but not auto-shutoff. So it just keeps looping around."
2,"beautiful design, mediocre sound","I almost bought this system until I walked into a store and tried it out with my own tapes and CD. I'd strongly recommend you do the same.Problem: the speakers [are not good], and because they're bi-amped, you're stuck with them. If you put in regular speakers, both speakers and amp would get messed up.Instead I chose the Sony CMT-HP7, despite my worries about its slot-loading CD mechanism.I have another compact stereo system which I use in my living room, an older Sony, and its sound went from mediocre to superb as soon as I upgraded it with ... bookshelf speakers.Dear Panasonic: stop using such cheesy paper-cone speakers, you've got everything else right!Two and a half stars."
3,Nice but bad warranty support,"This unit is very compact but produces decent sound. However, the CD changer broke about 6 months after purchase, and now it is over 3 months in the repair shop and Panasonic still has not fixed it! The warranty station said not to buy Panasonic due to many failures.Update added: Panasonic eventually gave me a refund, but it took a long time."
4,One of the only decent hint books from Prima,"I don't know what the other people are talking about; it has the full points list for all of the characters. The only errors I found were that for the fighter's path, it doesnt' give all of the correct bets for the combat arena."
1,Classical Gas?!?! Please...,"Listening to the arrangement of ""Classical Gas"" evokes an image that could easily be taken directly from ""The Simpsons"": A 90-piece orchestra, probably performing in an outdoor amphitheater in front of a crowd of 60-somethings, laser lights, and Tommy Emmanuel delivering quite possibly the cheesiest performance in history. The guy is a decent player, no doubt, but it's hard to take him seriously as a musician with this garbage. After the intro when those electric guitars enter, it's hard not to either laugh or groan.I also agree with the other review regarding the lousy sound. This was recorded in 1995, not 1945, so you'd expect something a little better production-wise. If I were Tommy Emmanuel, I'd be embarrassed to have this recording in my catalog. This is the kind of thing you'd expect to find in the $3.99 bin at Wal Mart."
1,Blades are not carbide,"I too am disappointed with the blades. They are razor sharp and cut fine but they are not tungsten carbide. They are high speed tungsten steel. If you read carefully the ""technical details"" will say high speed steel which is correct. Who ever wrote the ""product description"" saw the word tungsten steel on the package and made a huge leap and wrote tungsten carbide. There is a big difference. If you have the KP312 plane you will have to invest in several of these blades. It will be part of the cost of working timbers. You will also pay attention to nails, grit, and dirt on the surface so as to extend the life of your blades."
3,Reducing my cholesterol...,I truly hope to reduce my cholesterol drinking one capsule a day and of course watching to eat as healthy as possible. I only had taken a quater of the bottle content. Even though they smell quite a bit - which I had read that is the way it should be to avoid destroying the content that really works on your circulatory system - I don't taste any after flavor.
1,WORST RETAIL EXPERIENCE,"I received the Atlin Terry mocs in November 2010, by Febrary 2011 the stitching had broken and unraveled, exposing toes. I contacted the manufacturer L.B. Evans about returning and perhaps purchasing a more expensive item and paying the difference. They refused, requiring me (a disabled person) to find a way to get the shoes to the post office and pay to have them returned. My offer of purchasing a higher priced item was rejected. What to do now? Mail order from Lands End."
4,Sizing,These do run very small. He normally wears an 8 1/2 so I ordered a 9 but that's still too small. I've exchanged for a 10 but haven't received them back yet. Other than that they look durable and feel REALLY good on your feet.
2,Disappointed in the Poor Quality,"These slippers look good coming out of the fancy box with their name in gold print, but as soon as I looked inside the slippers, I knew I'd be sending them back. The raw edges of the lining were completely visible on both sides of both slippers, almost as if they weren't stitched (or glued?) properly. In addition, there was a spot on one toe where the sole was not glued down and gaped away from the shoe upper. For $40, I expected better quality. Disappointing."
5,Excellent perspective of Christianity's beginning,"To read any of Bart Ehrman's books will truly allow you to enter into the world of Christianity without the typical Christian rhetoric and spin. It is refreshing to see a more historical (and therefor in my opinion accurate) depiction of the start of Christianity. To put aside all the grace, love, and repentance speak to see what the first followers of Jesus of Nazareth were like and truly about. It ashame that the church(es) have painted such inaccurate pictures of greats like Mary Magdalene. And why cannot the true foundation of the church be a woman (after all who better to understand grace, love, and sacrifice)"
5,It's Beautiful!,"I have been searching, online and off, for a shelving unit for my living room for quite some time. We live in a small condo and were sorely in need of extra shelving space for pictures, etc. I found this item, which was delivered in approx. 1 week. We had a little problem problem putting it together, more specifically, making certain it was even for proper placement of the the glass shelves. Other than that, it was pretty simple to put together. It looks great in our living room and I'm really happy we purchased it."
5,Pretty good stuff,"First, the surface of this paper is shiny, but not sticky, and will not smear. It produces prints every bit as good as any laboratory (and in most cases, better, because you do the pre-production).Second, Canon had a two-fer deal on their site, so I scooped up what I could afford of this topnotch paper at very reasonable prices. I also bought a bunch from Amazon.Used with the Canon Pixma Pro 9000 MkII printer, this paper sets a new standard for home/office/studio printing. I am a pro photographer, but it's not my only source of income. I run a small home studio and feel confident that the prints I sell equal or exceed the quality available anywhere else."
5,Real Computational Linguistics,"Computational Linguistics is not only the toys in Scholar's hands. It should solve the problem of natural language communication between humans and computers. This book give us systematic and complete solution and 'solid' solution.It is a real and true computational linguistics. We need 'solid' foundation more than 'smart' technique in CL. If you are interested what's a real CL, this book is worth reading and using as textbook."
2,wrestle,"an older 10% production, this was made before a lot ofnudity was in films. actors are some of bel-ami boys,they are cutebut not exciting in this format"
1,Wrong Item,Did not receive product that was advertised....Returned for credit....repurchased product through ebay...Product received as advertised....very sturdy and easy to use.......my father who had a stroke over 6 yrs. ago found this product very convenient and helpful for getting in and out of bed .....The product would be more benificial if it had more than 1 locking position.......could be even more user helpful.....but still very happy with the product........
1,JUNK,"All had acid all over them; but 2 batteries looked usable. I tried the 2 that were somewhat clean and put them in a headset, they lasted 1/2 hour. I threw them away too.This was the first time I received junk from an Amazon supplier. Did not send back. (I'm sure they were counting on that) - Pay your money take your chances."
5,Good price for breyers,"This is a good buy for breyer horses. Typically, you can pay at least 20.00 for one horse. My daughter liked this b/c the mom and the baby were together and ""matched"". Fast shipping and looks just like the pictures. Just be careful with Breyers, their legs break easily if played with too roughly. However, they are the most real looking model horses out there.Mom of 3"
5,Absolutely outstanding book -- could not put it down,"This is an absolutely outstanding book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The book chronicles a down-and-out guy with nothing to lose who attempts the second largest cash heist ever. The author does a terrific job of telling both the criminal and human sides of the story. While painting a vivid picture of the crime, its mechanics, and the ensuing police investigation, one also gets a good feel for the people involved, what their lives were like, and how they came to be part of the heist. Really, an outstanding book, even for folks who generally don't read books very often."
4,Pam Ann a must have...,"If you think of all those times you got on a plane and thought to yourself....Goodness, that flight attendant doesn't look like she wants to be here looking after me, well you are right...Pam Ann is absolutely hilarious!!! Being a flight attendant myself I can totally relate to this comic performance. Very talented comedian, hopefully they bring out more things from Pam Ann."
5,Hilarious! (VERY Fast Shipping!),Purchased this DVD with 2 day shipping as I was going to be traveling soon and wanted something to watch. The product came an entire day earlier! Practically 1 day shipping for the price of 2! Over-all this is one of the most hilarious and entertaining things I have watched in months! (Maybe years?!) Definitely worth it if you have any interest in travel. Highly recommended.
3,WOW the jackked the price WAY UP!,"This was awesome when i bought this same product from this same supplier 6 months ago. back then i bought this for 23 dollars plus free shipping!it tastes great and mixes well, tastes like cold hot chocolate.What I did was take the recommended serving of this and mix it with 14oz of milk and blend that with 1 cup oatmeal, 8oz vanilla yogurt, 5 tablespoons of peanut butter, and a banana - then blend it all together in the blender for a HUGE calorie and energy boost! I cant remember exactly how many calories the shake yielded but if i remember right it was something close to 1200 calories per shake! if your a skinny guy and gaining weight is almost impossible, down a few of these shakes per day along with your regular meals and you WILL gain! i did."
2,No pictures of dishes,"My husband LOVES to cook and try different recipes. I bought him this book but he didn't care for it because it has no pictures and he likes to see what the dish is supposed to look like or even to decide whether he wants to try it or not by seeing the picture.This books gives a lot of Greek culture, he says, but he wasn't interested in that."
5,Awesome,I use this as a prewashing deep containing treatment and it works well. I love this product and will repurchase it!
2,pretty disapointing,"This book had a good plot and characters, but Ms. Peirce should have kept on writing about Daine and Numair, I hope her next series will be better."
4,A good read,"When I picked up this book my immediate hope was another saga that included Alanna and all my friends from the last book. Finding a completly different story was surprising, but not by any means unwelcome. I liked Sandry's Story and feel it has merit. It's a story about friendship and what friendship means, especially to those who feel like they're outsiders. I enjoy any good fantasy literature, whatever it's designated age, but to be truthful, this new series probably wasn't designed as much to satisfy veteran readers of Tamora as much as to reach a younger group of readers. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this new series."
1,"Simple Vocabulary, book was dead on confusing","This book was dead on confusing. The writer jumps back and forth from characters to narrate the story with first person, giving us the reader no idea who's speaking. Also, the ""romance"" (if you'd call it that) scenes were able enough for a 15 year old but the vocabulary was written for a little 9 year old. Weird, huh?"
4,"YEAH, I GUESS IT WAS O.K","The book was o.k. It kind of had a Tamora Pierce ""flair"" to it. I also have all the series she's ever written, and I would still have to say ALANNA ROCKS!!!!! The thing that bumbed me out was the name of the book. I mean, how stupid can a title be? It just kind of messed the book up. I still want to read the rest of the series to see if their better. Anyway- did Daine marry Numair, hmmm. We'll have to wait and see.(Also, the book didn't make me feel as if I were one of the charecters, and actually there.)"
2,a cheesy beach read,"Luckily for me, I bought this with plans of unwinding on a beach vacation because it was pretty cheesy. I don't think any of the characters were likeable and I don't think the whole plot was particularly plausible. To be honest, I left the book in my hotel rather than pack it back up to bring home. I didn't plan on rereading it...ever."
1,Sweet and Sour,"These screens really look good. That's the sweet side. The sour side is they do not fold flat. The most they go is about a 45 degree angle one to the other. We needed to store them in a closet when not in use, so we hack-sawed off the hinges, covered the blemish over with duct tape, and improvised with plastic zip-ties for hinges... which is not elegant, but works fine.So - the moral of the story is - if you plan to leave them open and in place all the time - these are great. If they need to be stored, or put up and taken down - keep shopping."
1,Need the hardware and can't find it anywhere,"During our move, four of the chicago screws that hold the panels together dissappeared. We've been to every hardware store in town and have visitied sites that specialize in chicago screws, nuts, bolts etc. and no one has these. They are made in China and come with the screen but if you lose them you're screwed (no pun intended). If anyone knows how/where to find the replacement screws/hardware please post it here. Thanks."
4,Great for when you get lost,"This little map book has put me back on track several times, a good quick reference in a compact book."
2,Got what I paid for,"I got these because I had a gift card and they were cheap. Unfortunately, after using them for a year, I realized how cheap. While they lasted, they were a constant annoyance. The twisting ends that locked the telescoping handles constantly unlocked, and the handles would slide out. Additionally, the handles were long enough to give you more leverage than the cutting head could handle, and they snapped. Good riddance."
1,MADE IN CHINA,ad said made in USA but was actually made in china. very poor packaging also. i'm surprised the shipper allowed it in such a flimsy and very large box.
2,not so great,"I am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls. I received them a few days ago and washed them, and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink. A melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this. The orange measuring cup/bowls towards the center are nice, but the outer bowls are rather flimsy."
1,I need help!!,"We received the item and when opened found it to be shattered. Made contact with the seller and was told it would be taken care of. It's been well over 3 weeks and it's still sitting in my garage and we have never been contacted by UPS or the seller. We would like our money back and the item picked up ASAP.Thank You, Dennis"
1,A newspaper article would suffice,"This book describes a forgotten tale of an Indian Maharaja removed from his throne by the British, and his futile attempts to return to India.The book is extremely long. It details every letter and every telegram the author was able to place his hands on. It might be interesting if you have some family connections to the Maharaja, but otherwise, it is just tiring.A newspaper article would have summarized the whole affair in enough detail. The book is too detailed to be interesting."
3,United States of Leland,"I could not enjoy this movie because my DVD came scratched, and that is one flaw of DVD's: You cannot advance the movie, if you are stuck on a disc scratch.All in all, we know what is going on, but we are anxious to see things resolved, I have a feeling I missed a lot of that movie."
3,Good Product......But!!!!!!,"Good product but the lettering for the functions on the remote control are smallish (which to people in their 50's is critical). Also, the timed recording mode cannot be turned on or off - if there is any item in the programming menu the VCR will be in the recording mode and will record whether the unit is turned on or off."
3,Does NOT record from DVD's,"Contrary to a previous review here, this unit does not record DVD's to VHS. It says so in the manual and I tried it myself. I'd like to be able to record the DVDs I make and copy rentals in case I can't watch them before they are due. It really sucks that most do not do this. Are they perhpas threatened by the Motion Picture Industry not to include this feature? You have to dig deep for them but there are some that will copy DVDs to VHS. This unit was a gift and it goes back tomorrow."
3,Connection Problems,"Initially, we purchased a Samsung DVD changer. We used it for two weeks in our RV. When we arrived home & connected it to our home TV, we had a red screen. After speaking with a tech support rep, we returned the unit to our local Sam's Club store and picked out another Samsung unit, the DVD/VCR combo. Upon connecting it up to our Sony wide screen TV, we again had the red screen problem. Since this seems to be a fairly common problem, why does Tech Support claim no knowledge of this?? My husband accidently discovered a switch on the front & when he switched it to ""Progressive"", the red screen went away!! We now have a great picture. But this just all happened today, so I will update if any further problems arise."
2,No DVD Player should only last 6 months,We got one of these for Christmas last year. We were so excited to have it because my VCR was on its last legs. Then about 3 months went by and it started freezing and skipping on dvds. Then 3 more months later the dvds would not even load at all.We ended up sending it back to Samsung's service center (Which cost us $60 in shipping!!) and they replaced two parts on it and sent it back to us. We recieved it today and an entire dvd did in fact play through. I'm hoping it'll last more than 6 months this time.I will not be buying another Samsung DVD/VCR. I have better luck with Magnavox anyway.
1,don't buy low-end,"Same problem as many others, with the DVD functions conking out and VCR working fine. As it is, no Godfather marathon last weekend, and ended up watching on a 15-inch computer monitor. :-(I bought this combo last Christmas, lasted 8 months. It isn't even worth returning because I can buy a new unit for cheaper than the shipping. I will look for a stand-alone unit now and go back to my old VCR.So strange, because I have other Samsung products, like a high-end monitor and camera with no problems for over 3 years. Probably is a problem with the low-end, mass-produced electronics."
2,"Looks beautiful, if it works",I just bought this HDTV because of the great price and when I got the TV it looked amazing and for a week it was the best $1500 I had ever spent but then the TV stopped working.I turned on the set one night about a week after it arrived and heard a pop. The bulb blew! The Tv was done already.Luckly Tigerdirect said they would refund me and I am waiting on the truck to take the TV back.If that all goes smoothly (please let it!) then I will have to decide whether to re-buy this TV.??? I can't decide. It looked so amazing but this break worries me about the product.Buy with caution and get the warrenty just to be safe.
1,Mitsubishi Scraping the Bottom!,"Read the reviews carefully, Buyer Beware! Mitsubishi once positioned itself on the upper scale of quality video and television products. No more. It's questionable if Mitsubishi's DLP sets can genuinely produce a true 1080p picture as advertised. Their customer service and customer relations is pure garbage. Don't touch this or any other Mitsubishi Television product with a 10-pole. You'll be taken and you'll be sorry. Sony, Samsung and Sharp offer superior products and customer service. Mitsubishi has fallen to the bottom of the heap."
2,Buckethead seems to be lost in the bermuda triangle...,Otherwise he would have focused more on shred and good times then this. Sorry that's all I got to say.
5,GREAT!,This little booklet was short and to the point. It really helped me in rethinking how I should eat and how to be healthier to my body. (With God's Help :) )
5,really good,"It has some limitations, and a few glitches, but other than that it is a very good editing program. It is also very easy to use. A friend of mine got to National Histroy Day competition with a documentary edited on this program."
4,Tris's Book,"Tris's book is the second book in the Circle of Magic series. In this book, a powerful earthquake has destroy parts of the Winding Circle's defenses. Although pirates have not dared attack it for years, they can't help but take advantage of its vunerability. The pirates are led by the pirate queen, Pahua, and her mage brother Enahar. The four young mages, Sandry, Tris, Briar, and Daja, are some of those to witness the pirate new and dangerous weapons--boomstones. These stones can explode a large amount of land and kill hundreds of people. All four mages must use their magics to protect the Winding Circle from invasion. Tris also dicovers what she needs most--control over her powers."
4,My Favorite,"Tris is my favorite character. I love her attitude and how she can controll the weather. I like the way the book was specified. Not too many details and not too little. I think I might be adicted to these books and can't wait to read Daja's,but the thing I would like most is if there were more Circle of Magic books. The 4 is only because you can't make it a # and a half."
5,You like Thrills and Magic then you'll love this one =:),If you like magic and thrills you'll just love this book. The story makes you not want to put the book down. I know I could not put the book down. I like that the book had a map so you could locate where everything was happening. The book also makes you wish you had magical powers like its charaters. Read about how the charaters use their powers to help their teachers and their only real home from dangers.
3,OK,"I thought Tris's book was alright. But, I don't really like Tris, and I thought the first book of the quartet (Sandry's Book) was a lot better. I happen to like Tamora Pierce's books with romance in it, but I still thought that the Circle of Magic books are good. I probably wouldn't buy this book, but I would definently get Sandry's Book! And although I do miss Tortall, it was a good change. I mean, there has to be other places other than Tortall!!! So anyway, on the whole it was pretty good."
4,Okay!,"This book has a different plot than most of her other books. Which, Tamora pierce is my favorite author, and i love THE IMMORTALS. I ordered Daja's book in the hope that there will be a bit more adventure in it. Overall this book was great and I can't wait to read Daja's Book."
1,I Thought The Monkees Were Supposed To Be In It.,"This is the strangest, most frightening piece of nightmare fodder I have ever come across in my life. If you are one for having a complete collection, at least try to buy it as part of the box set... Don't waste your money buying it individually. It is alright for bashing, but not as a worthwhile Monkees picture. Another Head it is not."
3,Not great but...,better than some of the alternatives. If you just are looking for a couple of sounds this might be worth the $5. Certainly better than the Snap! 2000 Sound Effects.
4,Afrikaans review from a new learner of the language,I bought this book/tape langauge course because I was interested in learning this beautiful language. It is easy to follow. The tapes are very helpful in learning how to pronounce the words. The content is about phrases and words that would be usefull to know if you were to go to South Africa. You need to listen to it and speak it often so you will get more familiar with the language. I would highly reccomend this package!
1,High price...low opinion,"I purchased these knives and paid the VERY high price because I never wanted to have to buy knives again. I considered them heirloom items. I've owned them just under two years, and I find that they do not hold their sharpness evenly or for an extended period. I almost find myself having to rinse, dry and sharpen them during butchering! They definately do not perform as well as my Forschner or Cutco knives. Alst they are extremely likely to chip at the edges and two of the set of three have already gotten chipped at the tip. Apparently they can't seem to handle any contact with bone. In this case, price certainly doesn't equal quality. I can't imagine why there were so many reviewers on here that recommended these knives. Maybe I got snookered and these are ""knock offs"" of the real Shun?"
3,The blade chipped :(,"I purchased this set about three months ago. I used the chef's knife to cut up a chicken and the blade chipped in three places. It's no wonder really, the blade edge is extremely thin. I try to cut through cartilage and not the bone. Sometimes I miss, oh well. I have had set of Wusthof knives for 20 years and they have never chipped. Even on chicken bones! I have not been able to sharpen my set of Wusthof knives to a satisfactory level, that is why decided to try the Shun set. The Shun knives are extremely sharp, I wish they were more durable."
5,Clapton Collector? Gotta have it!,"Doesn't really provide much information on this Japanese cd, so I'll use this opportunity to provide that info for those of you wondering what this mysterious import is :) The cd was released by Reprise and Duck Records in 1995 with the catalog number WPCR-440. It contains five tracks and comes with a booklet that has complete lyrics in both English and Japanese. The tracks are: 1.It Hurts Me Too(Elmore James p.1994)2.Crosscut Saw(R.G. Ford p.1983) 3.Everybody Oughta Make A Change(Sleepy John Estes p.1983) 4.Bad Influence(Clay-Vannice p.1986) 5.Before You Accuse Me(E. McDaniel p.1989) As usual with Japanese imports, the recording and packaging are excellent. Probably a little pricey for casual Clapton fans, but a wonderful gap filler for serious Claptonites."
1,Confusing to say the least!,"This volume seems to be the victim of ""progressive"" approaches to education. Grammar is presented in a fairly non-systematic way. This book presents grammar from its most common appearances in the Bible to its least common ones. The methodology is entirely inductive and will not work for everyone. I used this in a class of 6 people. We all found this text confusing! This is not a book I would recommend be used without a higly skilled teacher present. Clearly, this book is not for those trying to teach themselves."
5,Delish,"My husband and I really, really like this product. Compared to the convenient powder in packets, this dissolves much easier and is more economical for home and office. No after taste and very, one 1/4 dropper in cup-o-jo or tea is just what we like. Remember to refrigerate after opening."
1,I do not like,The color of the product change from clear to white it did not happened with the last one that I bought
1,One quick step to end insomnia.,"This movie was assigned for a class of mine and though it was only 90 minutes long I feel as though it lasted an eternity. Though I would call it boring, that would not begin to describe the malaize I felt while watching it. If you value your time and your mind, give this film a pass."
2,Dreadful Ending,"This book, which should have been the best, turned out to be a complete anti-climax. In fact, the only reason it's not getting a one-star review is because of the (he he he) ""nice"" pictures of Foxglove; she's better looking in this book than she is in Overlord!"
4,Great for kids and grown-ups too,A great little book for chess fans. An understanding of chess is assumed as well as some proficiency in the game. The puzzles should be fun and the answers are in the back of the book. Great book for kids or anyone wanting to improve their game.
4,Spy Fox,"My 7 year old son loves Freddy the Fish, Putt Putt, and Pajama Sam. I got this for him since it was the only character in the series we hadn't tried. He loves it. I like that he has to work on his observation skills and use logic. The only draw back on this one is that each time you complete a mission, you have to do some of the same things again, like getting the talk balloons from different characters and play the pig in go fish to get what you need to move on. After his first round, he was a little concerned that he was solving the exact same case, until he realized the signs were different in the club. For younger players, just remember you can hit F1 and get hints to overcome places the kids get stuck."
4,Insights into Industrialisation in java,"Diane Wolf tackles a complex area with style. Her objective presentation of the impacts on women (and their families) of the increasingly industrialised Java provides the reader with a wealth of information without overuse of terminology from either the developmental or feminist schools.Her consistent concentration on Java, recognising the diversity of Indonesia and the danger of generalising the numeorus ethnic groups, gives strength to her research, as does an overview of the methodology which illustrates the time Diane committed to the region in completing her study.The use of 'real people', and their stories, brought a personal touch to the book, allowing the reader to appreciate the reasoning behind many of the decisions and actions of the women involved.An interesting and informative book that I was able to read from cover to cover, but also able to refer to sparodically for specific information."
5,My favourite Autibiography,"Such a great read, I mustve recommended it to at least 100 people who have all enjoyed it. Such a fun time to be had making your way through this one. I love the emails from fans he has included too. Also the paperback has a bonus chapter updating you on his book tour from when the hardback came out."
4,great for bruce cambell fans,"On the assumption you are a Bruce Cambell fan (no one else would even look at this book), this is a great read. It has fun insites into his perfectly normal past as well as a perspective on what a long term struggling actor goes through. My only complaint is that I read through the book too fast."
5,You don't have to be an Evil Dead fan to enjoy this...,"An down to earth book that gives a glimpse into the lives, antics and personalities of Bruce Campbell and the people at the heart of the Evil Dead Series. As well as quenching my thirst for ""behind the scene"" tidbits I found myself charged by the basic need for fun and creativity that has driven Mr. Campbell and company to acomplish all they have."
5,Excellent,"I looked through 10 pages of other peoples reviews on this book and only saw 3 ratings below 4 stars. Two were people who seemed to believe that if a book is light and entertaining instead of thought-provoking, it's not worth a high rating, and one who claimed that the reviews were clearly written by Bruce's friends and family.I agree with everyone, except for those 3 people. The book is a pleasant and funny light read without trying too hard to be funny. It's a wonderful book for fans and you get great insight into Bruce's personality and makes you feel like you've gotten to know a nice guy.I loved hearing his opinions on people (not unlike myself) who are huge fans of the Evil Dead movies and his casual attitude about it all. And it's wonderful to feel acknowledged while knowing that he doesn't let cult film fanatisism go to his head.Excellent job, Bruce. We all appreciate it...... well..... most of us anyway."
5,A slap of realism,"Bruce Campbell's brutal honesty about the Hollywood industry paints a picture of what its really like being a professional actor. there isn't much glamour, and its a lot of work finding a job. Only those who love the craft of acting, not fame. Should venture out in this profession. Not everyone gets famous right away or at all. The message is printed clear, with no bitterness directed toward the up and coming would be actors out there. This is a good read if you want to become an actor.P.S. If you are an ""Evil Dead"" fan, then this book is for you."
5,A must-have for new mothers!,"So, so much more than a ""baby book"" or a scrapbook, this journal asks many thought provoking questions, and guides the new mom through the process of documenting so many of the precious details and important memories of her baby's first year that might otherwise get lost in the whirlwind and sleep deprivation of that first year. Even the feel of this book is solid and warm and just a little earthy."
2,"Good movie, but scenes were inexplicably missing.","The movie is good. Not great, but funny and entertaining enough to be worth a rental or even a purchase. However, having seen the film before, I noticed several missing scenes. Not scenes from an extended or uncut version either, but some of the original scenes from the original cut. Many of the scenes are important too. Some are essential to whatever this film has for a plot, and for whatever reason, they are just gone. Vanished. I am disappointed and hesitant to use Amazon rentals again."
3,You get what you pay for,"One of the wheels broke immediately after putting unit together. The telescoping pole was extremely difficult to operate and when I finally was able to extend it, it would not easily stay at the height I chose, no matter how much I tightened the collar. Luckily I do not have to wheel this unit around and for now I am able manage with the height it has ""chosen"" to stay at. If I ever have the need for another pole like this, I would spring for a higher quality pole if I am able to determine what that is by the description."
5,GREAT BOOK,"This book included everything i ever wanted to know about serial Killers. Fasinating, intriging, and led me to read more and research more on certain killers after having read the case studies on certain killers. I recommend to everyone who has the guts to deal with that tiny part of them that is fasinated with this kind of stuff."
3,All You Ever Wanted to Know About Serial Killers...Mostly...,"This is a veritable compendium of serial killers (who they are, how they kill, why they do it) and each killer has an in depth case study, and I do mean IN DEPTH! What more can I say. It was an interesting read with loads of resources for whatever macabre murder or murder type strikes your fancy...my only complaint is that there was actually quite a bit of repeated information. I'm assuming though that the author probably doesn't intend for the book to be read cover to cover (as I did), so he repeats information in various sections one might reference, probably to ensure his ideas are conveyed thoroughly for those not reading the entire book, like say, looking up a specific killer or type of killer. I give it a solid B, this would make a handy reference for a library or for use in a personal library if one writes about serial killers! :-)"
4,Entertaining is a creepy way,"This was entertaining, and really glad much information as far as what is going on inside the heads of these killers. Seemed to be well researched, but not for the weak stomach, it did give all the details."
5,fa la la fimo,this is a great book for people that like to do polymer clay. this has to be about the hardest book to get so i think the people who got me this book has a great customer service. wish all people that had companys would be this way.thanks
2,ONLY FAIR,"THE SELLER WAS VERY PROMPT , VERY PLEASED WITH THE SELLER, BUT THOUGHT THE BOOKWAS HARD TO READ ,TOO MUCH SCOTLAND BROGUE, BOOK ONLY FAIR WOULD NEVER REREAD IT"
4,Music from the heart!,"I first was introduced to Karen and her music at a ""Radical Forgiveness"" workshop. This was held in Cincinnati, Ohio and was based on the book ""Radical Forgiveness"" by Colin C. Tipping. Colin facilitated the workshop and Karen provided the music. This was a great experience! If you like music that has a great message this may be the CD for you. Her other collections are excellent as well. Her message is especially good for many of the changes women experience. Highly recommended. (D. Steven Ledingham)Don't know why the tunes are not listed on Amazon, so here they are: (The ""Still Small Voice"" CD)The Mountains, Not That Different, Who Do You Think You Are, Eleventh Commandment, Once You've Love A Woman, Still Small Voice, Supper For One, In The Name Of The Father, The One Who Loves Me, I Need A Witness, Be Strong"
4,Excellent Program !!!,"Terrifc program, wow! Tha's why I bought 3 more programs from Magix:Video Deluxe 2.0 Plus;Music Maker 7 Deluxe; Video/Music Maker Generation 6 Deluxe: This aplications ROCKS!!!(Portuguese: Excelente programa,wow! E por isso que eu comprei 3 mais progrmas da Magix: Video Deluxe 2.0 Plus;Music Maker 7 Deluxe; Video/Music Maker Generation 6 Deluxe: Estes programas da SHOW!!!"
5,When life gets crazy.,"I've read a couple of Elaine St. James' books, and this is my favorite. Lots of important reminders for creating more peace and joy through simplicity. I pick this book up when life gets too crazy. It's a good gift, too."
3,Not what I thought,"This book is great for the over stressed under rewarded professional, it is not however strictly a book on all out simplicity, it is more about de-cluttering your lifestyle."
5,A Great Guide For Creating Adventure and Wonderful Memories,"Where was this book when I had my first child? This book is a great way to help plan fun outings with little kids, especially if you're new to parenting or Southern California. It's well organized, very thorough, easy to use, and formatted so that you can get an overview without getting bogged down in too much detail. I like how you can check out the events that occur by month, like the harvest festivals or holiday events. I highly recommend this book for new moms and moms who are looking for adventure and wonderful memories with their kids."
1,Grossly over-priced,"They haven't even titled this right. The product pictured is Future Glue. This size of Future Glue sells for under $2 almost anywhere. By the time you add shipping to this one, you will have paid at least four times what it is worth. Your local hardware store probably stocks it."
2,Book is great! Where is the CD?,"The book is supposed to be sold with the CD that is specifically referenced on the cover. I sent the first book back and received another -- also minus the CD. The second book showed signs of wear -- returned by another customer trying to get the CD? I finally contacted the author who graciously sent me the files that would have been on the missing CD.This experience was so different from all of my other experiences with Amazon that I am inclined to wonder how much of it was an Amazon problem and how much of it was a publisher problem. David Lyon, the author, was the person in the loop who was really interested. It wouldn't have been so ironic it whole issue had not been about a Configuration Management book!"
3,it's okay,"it's easy to use, but the recordings seem to be fuzzy and static-y. It works for my purposes, but the recording quality is not great."
5,Excellent and simple to learn,"This DVD is easy to follow and the exercises really seem to work. I was somewhat dubious at first, but after trying the exercises I'm quite excited. The form is easy to learn, and the format makes it easy to follow from the first time. The same form is used for a ""power"" exercise and a more meditative ""peace"" exercise. Both work well, and his philosophy appears well thought-out and grounded.I like the fact that he uses real people in the video, not models or experienced martial artists. It has a authenticity to it.If you want something more simple to learn than Tai Chi, yet has many of the same benefits, I would recommend this video."
5,This is GREAT!,"I recently ordered this DVD from Amazon and after only one session I can tell it has helped my back pain, cleared my mind, and improved my overall mood. Its very easy to learn, short, and invigorating but not strenuous. I've taken Tai Chi, various forms of Yoga and Pilates and this is my favorite practice to date because it boils down and incorporates everything you need into one short moving meditation that includes stretching, breathing, concentration and muscle tension. I can't endorse this product enthusiastically enough! If thisDVD has helped my back pain after one session I can't wait to see what it does with continued practice. Highly recommend this DVD!!!"
4,Excellent work on a fascinating dynasty,"They were brilliant, violent, and dissolute, and it seems appropriate that they reigned over France's Hundred Years War with England. They witnessed the disaster at Crécy and the triumph of the Maid of Orleans. But all seven of the Valois kings were complex and fascinating men and their story is presented here in an able translation of the work of a prize-winning popular French historian."
2,Does Not Address Important Issues,"This book ignores the elephant in the room - the skyrocketing cost of education. How much should parents pay? How much should kids borrow? Should kids be required to repay some of the money to their parents if it comes out of retirement savings? When should parents tell their college kids that they are not paying any more because the student is not working hard and playing too much? Should a kid at a private school be forced to transfer to a cheaper state school if they are not working up to their potential? Will kids take college more seriously if they have to ""stop out"" and work at menial jobs for a while?"
4,sweet...but kona town still reigns,"this album is incredible, but the reason i didn't give it five stars was because i was looking for another album just like kona town..that album is probably my favorite album in my collection of cd's..it rocks me and moves me in ways i can't understand..i feel that ""In with the Old"" is more like 311's revolver..a sound that you will have to get used to because it is different than their other albums...Ron Saint Germain produced this album for pepper and same with 311's revolver..i feel that they are somewhat similar in certain aspects..i still absolutely love ""In with the Old"" because i am a huge pepper fan, but if you are new to the band..check out KONA TOWN first. catch you on the flip side...."
4,Our Vet recommended this shampoo,"Our vet suggested this shampoo for our dog who has skin conditions; it helps keep the bacterial skin infections at bay. We must have some other issue in addition as it does not alleviate his skin condition totally. I suspect it will be a combination of things like washing him once a week, feeding him cod liver oil, and finding additional methods to treat his skin condition."
2,Motor bearings lasted 6 months,"I have the 18"" model. It ran 12 hours a day for 6 months then suddenly stopped. I turned the fan blade by hand and noticed it would hardly budge. I took the motor apart and the sleeve bearings on either end were almost dry. I packed some grease into those bearings and reassembled the motor and it is now working, but I don't think my fix will last long.When I first got the unit, I noticed that spinning the fan blade by hand was more difficult than I expected. The sleeve bearings are too high in friction so you pay for electricity to overcome this as well as create a lot of heat that tends to eat up lubricant.The shutter assembly is understandably very thin and light weight. Unless you mount it to an absolutely flat surface, the slightest racking of the aluminum frame will prevent the shutters from opening or closing.Not too impressed with this unit."
2,Roger's review,Memorex MB1055 cassette recorder--The speaker is too small & thus doesn't pick up the sound sufficiently to be heard clearly. When you turn the volume up to hear the music it sounds like it is vibrating. The lid to close the battery compartment is missing.
3,Some what disappointed,It appeared to be larger in the aid. However its ok. I would still recommend this site to anyone who are searching to order on line. Thanks for you asking. that really made me feel appreciated.
5,A welcome edition for serious biblical scholars,"I've been deeply involved with scholorly understanding of the bible for quite some time, both as an anthropologist and a lover of ancient Greek text. I must say that from the academic level this book hits more or less square on. The comments left before concerning this book were made by religious people, who naturaly feel the urge to protect and promote Jesus as a God and not a man. Their comments were quite colored, and for a more balanced view of this book, please read the actual book reviews by less influenced groups."
4,This book had me giggling from beginning to end.,"Fractured Fairy tales has some of the funniest fairytales that I've read. Though it's not a book you'll read straight through from beginning to end, I found myself pulling it out every time I needed a pick me up. The stories are very witty, and you'll have a good time reading it."
1,The Fairy Tale is Over Success Was Not Achieved Here,"Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door and Snow White Blood Red edited by Ellen Datlow as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books."
2,Classic cartoon stories with 90's update?,"I bought the book hoping for reasonable reproductions of the original ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" from Bullwinkle. For example, Pinocchio wakes up and wants a cup of ""Joe""? Come on, how nineties can you get? That is just one example of how the original fractured fairy tales have been bastardized by this book."
3,BIO: JOHN WILKES BOOTH,"AS A HISTORY BUFF, I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. I FOUND SEVERAL ERRORS IN IT AND I DID NOT THINK IT DELVED MUCH INTO HIS PERSONAL LIFE, WHAT MADE THIS MAN TICK. I KNOW HE HATED LINCOLN AND LIKE SO MANY SOUTHERNERS, THEY DID NOT GIVE HIM A CHANCE WHEN HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. IF HE WAS NOT ASSASCINATED, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST CHANCE FOR THE SOUTH TO SURVIVE, AS IT WAS....THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE CARPETBAGGERS. WHAT A WASTE....."
1,Possibly the worst sham ever,"I was tricked into buying this book when I placed my order for God's Politics. It represents an extremist view of ethics, shaped by Ayn Rand and movie stars. It is verbose, didactic and essentially useless for any serious ethical inquiry.I believe its promotion by Amazon is part of an orchestrated campaign to garner false positive publicity for the book, which appears to have been published by a vanity press."
2,One hit wonder.,Only the first movie is any good. Your only use for the other two films will be to try to decide which one is lousier. Just buy the DVD of the first film
4,Scream...Laugh...It's Entertaining,"Although the 3rd film leaves MUCH to be desired, it is still great entertaining. With witty characters (that both deserve and don't deserve death) throughout the series, everything has a purpose. The end of the 3rd sucks when you find out who the killer is, and you will feel a little cheated, but all in all, this packaged set is a good buy for any fan of the series.4 Stars because the 3rd just isn't the greatest and left me a little dissapointed, but nothing too major. :)"
4,"They're not 'Army of Darkness', but what is?","I saw the first Scream movie, years ago because I loved the look of the mask and I had heard good things about it - Number 1 is simply a classic slasher, ranking up there with the first Nightmare on Elm Street, The Evil Dead Trilogy, and the original Halloween. The 2nd one has its great kills and great parts but I would say it would have to be the worst in the trilogy - I hate Neve Campbell's boy friend so much - I want to stab in the forehead with a nice for real. {he's that idiot for Sliders} Anyways, the third one is my favorite because the Scream Stalker is so much cooler - he knows what he's doing. Its only downfall is countless of unfunny jokes. If you are a slasher fan, these films are not ones to miss. But if you're looking for horror film cult classics see the Evil Dead Trilogy or the first and third Nightmare on Elm Street films. If you love these films - I strongly suggest you watch and enjoy 'Scary Movie'"
5,Greatest trilogy ever!!,wes craven is a amazing. All his movies are great....but the Scream films are my favorite. 5 stars baby yeaaaaahhh
4,1/2 Truths & 3 3/4 stars rating,"In this world of digital cut & paste MTV style editing, people often have trouble sitting through a portion of movie that isn't changing scenes every 2 seconds, or doesn't cut to the chase scenes fast enough. For those who can stand to let a character or two develop, this is a pretty cool movie (although hard to sit through for different reasons). I had trouble with the characters in the beginning (not the best acting starting out), but man, they bring it on in time. The movie is not a horror movie but some scenes are pretty hard to watch, and not wanting to spoil any part of the movie, the one that would be the hardest is done Hitchcock Psycho Shower style. But the images my mind conjured - whew! Anyway, I'm glad I watched the film and if you are a film buff, I believe you will enjoy it too. Remember, no one is going to win any Oscars with this film, but you will be left moved (momentarily scarred) none the less. Peace Out!"
3,"Skiliftaphobia. Just because I made it up, doesn't mean I don't now suffer from it","Frozen has a very neat idea, a few sequences of genuine suspense, okay acting, but ultimately it runs a little thin by the end. Three young people get trapped in a ski lift because some idiot workers don't care enough to pay attention. They are left high above the ground in below freezing temperatures, with full knowledge the resort will be closed during the week. Guess what? It's Sunday night! Nooooooo!!! Think of Open Water, but instead of sharks, we get a very hungry pack of wolves. It's far from great, but it's probably Adam Green's most complete work, though Hatchet and Hatchet II have moments of goodness. It's worth a rental on a cold fall or winter night.The Blu-ray looks and sounds good, but I've seen better. There is also a series of interesting featurettes that run as long as the actual film."
4,"For a Man V Nature flick, well done","If you can imagine a storyline revolving around 3 friends stuck on a ski lift, you'd be hard pressed to top this one. Not giving anything away! The director did a very good job of adding plot, story, depth, and action to what would seemingly be a run of the mill generic plotline. The characters feel real, the hopelessness seems, well, hopeless, and aside from a few annoyingly trivial points, Frozen is a movie I've rewatched just for its brilliant take on what would seem a horribly accidental but normally much less eventful ""problem,"" if such a word could be used. At the very least rent it - its a fun albeit disturbing ride."
4,Look for Easter Egg on Frozen.,"Most of the other customer viewers said it all but I noticed that in this movie you couldn't really see the collage kids breath in the outdoor scenes. There is an Easter egg on the dvd version, go to Special Features, then hit the button to go to the left side of one of the actor's collar and what looks like a paw print will highlight that spot. Easter egg title....Chair 92 Easter Egg. I'd say this movie will keep your interest from the beginning to the end. It shows you what people would go through to fight for survival and the will to live. I wanted to see this movie in the theater but it never made it here where I live. So waiting for it to come on dvd well....was worth the wait. This is more of a suspenseful movie then horror and was a refreshing outlook with the story as appose to a slasher B movie.in a short amount of time we discover just how 3 friends become even closer then ever before."
5,ICE COLD!,"THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT!I GOT MJ'S 'THRILLER' SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW CUZ THIS MOVIE WAS A THRILLER AND A HALF!MAN, I DIDN'T KNOW SKI LIFTS GO THAT HIGH IN AIR...HELLLOOOOOOOO!!CAN YOU HEAR ME FROM DOWN HERE?!!!!!WELL IF YOU CAN LET ME TELL YOU 2 THINGS1. GO SEE FROZEN AS SOON AS YOU CAN ASAP CUZ THIS MOVIE IS CRAZY! AND...2. DON'T JUMP OFF THAT SKI LIFT BRO, THERE'S MAD WOLVES DOWN HERE JUST WAITING TO TEAR YOU UP! IT'S WINTER AND THEY'RE HUNGRY! LMAO!CALL FOR HELP BEFORE YOU GET FROZEN!!LOVED IT!P.S. THANKS, BUT I THINK I'LL CURL UP BY THE FIRE PLACE DUDE, YOU CAN GO HIT THOSE SLOPES. ROFL!"
1,Poor Construction,"The quality was notably less than I would have expected from a set of Japanese tools. Since I didn't pay much for them, I wasn't too upset about this. I tried using the concave cutters to remove a small branch (approximately 1/16th of an inch). Rather than cutting the branch, it just smashed the wood. The bark is torn and I had to attempt to repair the damage to the branch with tweezers and a knife. When I took a closer look at the cutters, I noticed that the blades didn't mesh properly. These tools aren't worth the savings. They'll just damage your trees. I'm definitely sending these back and paying the difference for a smaller set of Joshua Roth tools."
4,Let It Go,Do you not think that it is time to let the past be the past. A decade later and we are still concerned about how wrong Charles Thompson was. Learn from this book learn from his mistakes. I have had the great fortune of getting to know him personally and he has a great story to tell. Let's just grow up.
2,Beautiful but fragile,"I bought this toy for my daughter, and she was exceptionally happy to get it. She couldn't wait for me to get it out of the box, unfortunately within 5 minutes of flying it around the room, one of the legs snapped and had to be super glued back together. She doesn't mind that it had to be glued, but couldn't understand the weakness of the toy. She had received another one also for her birthday and that one's front leg broke within a few minutes of play as well. These horses are very pretty to look at, but not really meant for much play time."
4,Pre-Pilates at its best,"Lynne does an excellent job explaining the foundations of Pilates. This is not a typical ""workout"" DVD. She emphasizes alignment, breathing, and working from the inside out. Her instructions are easy to follow and her tone is soothing and encouraging. The intermediate or advanced practitioner will need a more advanced workout."
5,Effective and Concise,"Another review gave a VERY detailed review that helped me choose this book among the many others. This is the perfect review book!!! I have been out college for 20 years so all math and general test taking skills were very rusty. This book gave me everything I needed to pass without stress. The math section is what makes this review book so much better than the rest. Apparently CBEST revised the test several years ago and no longer includes some of the more difficult math that many of the books spend time covering. The math was easy if you read the Princeton Review Cracking the CBEST. Get this book and only this book and you will be set. I was able to study and pass with flying colors with only 9 days preparation (I have 3 kids, so I only had a few hours of very interrupted time per day!)"
4,Passed on the First Try!,I graduated from college 10 years ago. Exams freak me out period! I got through this book in 1 week! I took the exams in the back of the book. I only focused on the Reading and Math section! I saved the writing for the day before the exam. It was easy to get through and the right answer explanations were detailed. Also I used the Cliff Notes book. I got that book because it had 4 exams! I only used it for the exams (again only focused on Reading and Math sections). This book did not do a good job in explanations. I would say the Cracking the CBest book is all you need! I wanted to mention do not use Kaplan! I got that book as well tried one of the exams and the questions were way too hard! It will give you an unnecessary headache!!! Good Luck!!!!
1,kills batteries,This recorder kills batteries.I use the recorder turn it off and try to use it again (within 24 hours) and the batteries are dead. I called Memorex...They said to take the batteries out after every use. Not a great idea as I purchased this to use while driving.
1,Not very good,"Crummy web software with minimal use. Freeware online is a better choice than this.Also, the only other review at this time comes from a seller of the software who is just trying to up the ratings."
1,Bad company policy when things go wrong!,"Don't buy this drill! Once the battery doesn't charge anymore, (mine went in less than a year) the company doesn't sell any replacement batteries. You end up being stuck with a power tool that's worthless.I contacted the company over and over and basically it's too bad for me!I loved the drill while it worked, but now I'm so sour about what they're doing I'm telling everyone. They should let you know up front that there is no replacement battery! Barbara K sucks - she should make this right!"
2,needs more exitement,"it was ok , i thouht it was boring because it did not have that much exciment in the book. i think the book was not that bad it was not scary at all. it sounded like a mini mystery book. this book is about two girls that get stuck in a library. and they dont know what to do. they write signs and call the police but t there plan dose not work. I did not like this book that much. the only part that can scare you if you ara a scary cat is the par when it lookes that the dolls are moving. if you want to read a good book read down these mean streets by piri thomas."
2,Poorly written,"OK book, but it is quite dated. The writing style is annoying. You can tell it's written by a coder, not a professional tech write. I don't recommend it."
1,Not for a newborn!,"This costume is not sized for a newborn! I bought this from BrandsOnSale because it is advertised as a costume that fits babies 7-15 pounds and 20-25 inches. The costume is about 4 feet long, however, and the the hood fits my head easily (a normal adult's head). Please do not buy this for your infant -- it will definitely not fit. It is also very rough texture - not something I would put on my 2-month old baby."
4,A Great Book on Homeopathy For Cats,"This is a useful reference text for anyone who wants to treat their cat with homeopathic remedies, I found it very practical and informative."
3,It Was Alright,"The fact that the WWE owns the majority of wrestling footage in the country, you'd figure that this would have been worth the money to purchase. This dvd set has only a handful of matches in full (which is pretty bad considering the caliber of talent that is featured). The only matches that I sat through and enjoyed were the Magnum T.A.- Tully Blanchard, Snuka-Muraco, and Bret-Owen. I wasnt to crazy about the Rhodes-Flair match though. Anyway, they could have thrown in some War Games matches from the NWA/WCW era. I believe those matches would have made the dvd's worth buying. I'm gonna end up trading it in for The Ric Flair Collection. Thanks!"
5,THE MOST INCREDIBLE CAGE MATCHES!!,"This is #16 on the top 130 greatest WWE DVD's. This DVD may be expensive but it is worth it. BloodBath is a great DVD to have, no doubt.Triple H vs. Mankind was a great match and it was obvioulsly bloody. Triple H trys to use D-X to help him steal the match and I'm not gonna tell you the ending.Edge vs. Kurt Angle was a weird choice to have on this DVD. Edge & Angle didn't have a great match but it was interseting and defintly worth seeing.This DVD is great and it is brutal so if you can't take blood don't pick up this DVD because there is tons of blood."
4,They forget one...,"I can't give 5 stars because when they made this compilation they forget one of the greatest:Mankind vs. The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock al IYH: BreakDown on September/1998. It was incredible the way that Mankind almost defeat both of them, flying from the top of the cell to land on this pair of morons. Sadly the referee applied that stupid rule of nail one of your oponents in the mat instead of go out of the cage, and the Rock won nailing Ken. Meanwhile Mankind scalate the cage.This was one of the best matches that I ever seen !!!"
2,i haven't seen all this matches yet,i didn't c all da required matches listed on da tape but da greatest cage matches that i did c and show b included on da tape is1.Kurt Angle vs edge Smackdown 5/31/02 ****1/42.HBK vs Undertaker HITC Bad Blood 97 ****3/43.Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit Raw 2001 ****1/44.Edge vs Chris Jericho Smackdown 2002 ****5.Mick Foley vs Undertaker HITC KOTR 98 ****6.Mankind vs HHH Summerslam 97 ****7.Bret vs Owen Hart Summerslam 94 ***3/4
1,HUGE let down ! sux!,Horrible Let down and also the dvd sucks ! I would never buy this dvd again if i could ! Thank god i sold mine !WWE SHOULD HAVE PUT MORE WORK IN TO THIS DVD! Thx for nothing wwe !
3,Not enough detail for a beginner,"This book is OK and it does give you some basic information but it didn't really get to me like ""The Complete Guide to Quilting"" by Better Homes and Gardens.This book is a good backup with projects to get you started in quilting."
5,"If you have no clue, this book is for you. :o)","To put it simply, prior to this book (and ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Quilting""), I could barely reattach a shirt button. I don't know what made me think I could hand stitch a quilt, but I just jumped into it. 6 weeks later, I had a beautiful, hand made lap quilt as a present for my mother.This book shows the necessary techniques, provides pearls of wisdom and offers projects from start to finish, all with a nice touch of humor."
1,This should NOT be your first quilt book.,"I bought this book because the reveiws I read lead me to belive this book covered basic qulit making. The book for the most part does indeed cover the basics BUT, with one huge omission. The topic of mitered-corner borders is not addressed at all. This is a monster mistake as the majority of quilts are finished with a 45 degree mitered corner border and it is an important skill for any quliter to learn. had I known this topic was not covered at all, I would not have wasted my money on this book."
5,Your first Quilt Book,Recommended to me by a beautiful quilter and I think it is the best book so I purchased one for my sister as well.
5,This was my fisrt quilt bbook,This books continues to answer some questions even after I have become more experienced. This is a great book for beginning quilters!
1,Title Mistake?,"This book was highly recommended. Oh how I was excited to receive this book, as I opened the pages I thought, what? This was not what I expected, where is the easy step by step color photos? hello, I am a beginner. Where was the easy to understand directions? I was so unhappy with it, I returned it."
5,British Holden Caulfield,"OK, maybe Amis is a little full of himself. The Rachel Papers does get bogged down a bit as Amis seems to want to impress himself above all others. But, Amis displays a savage wit that eviscerates a stratum of British society. I've read a few of his other books and the guy is a true talent, which I regret to report since Amis probably lives for these reviews to feed his insecurity. Anyway, The Rachel Papers is like The Catcher in The Rye on steroids. Amis presents a latter day Holden Caulfield that actually gets to live out a few of his sexual fantasies. Overall, a great book!"
3,Autobiographical with peaks of linguistic brilliance,"Martin Amis went to Exeter College, Oxford and lived before that with his father in a village in Oxfordshire. Sound familiar, of course it's just like the plot in the book!. Martin Amis' first novel shows hints of true genius. The characterisation of the books sort-of-hero, Charles Highway is fascinating, and he dissects the typical foibles of an adolescent with skill and integrity. Other high points include the amazing vocabulary that the book is written with. The outstanding prose makes me (excuse me) laugh out loud every time I read it and almost makes up for some of the unconvincing aspects of the plot. Autobiographical? Yes. Self-Obsessed? Yes. Extremely funny? Definately. Worth Buying? Without a doubt. Some have said that to start reading Martin Amis, other books like Money or Success would be better. I disagree. The Rachel Papers is a brilliantly funny introduction to the writings of one of the strangest and most talented British Novelists."
5,Adolescence told with style.,"I read this book about a year ago, but as I recall, there is a scene where Charles, the protagonist, suavely takes a used condom out of the trashcan in response to his girlfriend's reminder that he has one left--""I saw it last night"". Charles Highway is a lecher and a brilliant one at that."
2,Let Down Big Time,"I bought this book all ready to love it, and ended up mourning its lack of humanity, its quick slap-dash descriptions of women, and its obsession with sex--and even that wasn't good. I think fans of Amis will enjoy this book, because it's his style. Those who pick it up expecting meaning, however, might be let down."
1,Poor Performer,"I own this unit. I attempted to purchase earphones from Olympus but after phoning them 5 times, and getting put on hold each time, I gave up. I was never able to speak to a live person.The unit itself does not have enough audible power with batteriess or by AC connection. I do not recommend this unit."
5,great microcassette recorder,The doctor I work for has gone through a lot of microcassette records and this Panasonic model has been the one with the clearest recording out of all the other brands he has had. Great machine for the money.
2,???,"Unless you already have the pumper, don't buy this...I know have a useless waste of space container whose lid won't seal because I don't have a pumper...it does make a nice glass for those really hot days when I just want a big glass of ice water...save your money...tupperware is the way to go."
5,Worthwhile and moving...,"I am just kicking myself. I had the chance to see this wonderful poet read, and I missed it. The poems in Cardboard Urn are pure, elegant, and moving. Meyerhofer's work covers a variety of subjects, but is consistent throughout in quality. Get this book!"
5,Great Seller,"My order arrived only three days after I placed it (over a weekend, in fact) and worked just the way it's supposed to. I even got a second memory card free. I would definitely shop from this seller again."
3,Be sure to read the description,"I bought this as a gift for my mom only looking at the picture and not the description. I thought, ""Wow! What a great price for this set!"" When she got it she asked me if it was supposed to come with a cup. I had to go back and review the item and indeed it says that it is just a saucer. It would have been nice if the picture would have been of a saucer only and not a cup and saucer."
5,Keep an eye on this band !!!,"I have purchased both cd's and I can say I am hooked. They seem to challenge and push music to another level. They have a classic sound with a new edge. I was able to catch these guys in New York and they are amazing. These guys know what they are doing musically and it shows, they are tight and the progressions are amazing.If you get a chance, CHECK THEM OUT !!!!You will not be disappointed !!!!"
4,Good story,"Loved the All Creatures series and enjoyed the story behind the characters, although the filming quality was a little dark, and I prefer outdoorsy and sunny."
4,Good period piece,This DVD had a lot of good character plot to it and the set was authentic. Issues such as women's equality were well dealt with as well as different levels of society. Lot to it and I highly recommend it.
3,The Celebrity Black Book,"I rated it just OK because I failed to notice the publication date of this book. So many persons that I want to look up are not there because 2005 was too long ago. I should have been more careful, and I will be from here on out when I order books."
1,Civil Engineering PE Exam Guide - Breadth and Depth,"Paid over $90 for this book at Borders and was extremely dissapointed. The CD is an exact replica of what is in the book - Many equation errors and typos, no ""practice test"" questions as stated on the cover. The editors of this book are certianly not PEs and could never pass the test with this!"
3,Warning : the editorial review is not of this book!,"What a mess! The editorial review (excerpt from Kirkus reviews) is about the Eva Ibbotson book Morning gift - set in Vienna and Britain before and during World War II. Great book: 5 stars.The Diana Norman book is the one about the Saxon heiress. I also read it, but can not remember much about it, thought it was average."
2,Pricey & Loses the Seal,I really wanted this to work but what I found is the vacuum is 50/50. I wipe down the inner rubber washer & the lip of the container & it's still hit or miss. Pricey for an iffy product; I'll search for better vacuum sealed container.
5,just right,The selection of guitar straps in stores is kind of scary. 75 percent of what I saw was satanic or drug-related. The rest were just tacky. My daughter had seen this one in a store and when we went back to buy it it was gone. I was glad to find it on Amazon. Most of my Christmas shopping was done on Amazon. This was just what she wanted at a reasonable price.
3,does this contain recipes designed for Mastercook software?,"It seems this product contains 12,000 recipes designed for Mastercook software. this assumption is based on the 1st review of this product and that other buyers bought both Mastercook software and this product.no where in the product description is Mastercook referenced.Can anyone verify whether recipes are specific to Mastercook or for anyone interested in 12,000 recipes, regardless of software they have to view recipes?"
5,THE NEXT BIG THING,I HAVE LISTENED TO THESE TRACKS AND CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ARTIST BEFORE.I LOVE HIS SOUND.THE BEATS ARE PHENOMAL AND THE WORDS MAKE YOU LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER.THIS GUY NEEDS TO BE SIGNED TO A MAJOR LABEL AND I WISH HIM MUCH SUCCESS.
4,Smooth And Nicely Detailed,"A nice CD by Marion Meadows, some very good tracks here! Tales Of A Gypsy the best of the lot but there are other fine trakcs as well. Show Me, Show Me is good as well as Flava to name a few. This is an enhanced CD, so there are other goodies on this CD also. The quality of the CD itself is very good and should bring out the best in your stereo system. He does seem to have a thing with his hair as does another sax player???? An A+ CD!!"
1,Adams is Turning in his Grave,"Horrible printing of Adams' most obscure photos. Fuzzy images with none of the range of tones normally produced by his incomparable application of the ""zone technique."" The poor images even make it impossible to appreciate the words of John Muir."
4,The best producer on the mic?,"How about the best producer. Period. J-Zone has taken basement-sounding beats to a level that's unspeakably dope. Just check out the beat creativity on tracks such as ""Bum-B**** Ballad"" and ""Jailbait Jennifer."" What makes J-Zone extra dope are his concepts. Though the subjects of his raps are nothing new (women, sex), his unabashed take on them is very refreshing and always done in a humorous way. He's not afraid to go that extra mile to offend the listener. Just listen to the hilarious, ""Trojan War,"" a song about unprotected sex. The fact that he can flow better than any commercial rapper out now, says a lot about his talent as a rapper and producer and DJ. Someone hand him his ""best producer on the mic"" plaque now."
4,Roll through the ghetto pumping 'Ice Ice Baby'...,"What grabs you when you listen to this album for the first time is the quality and the originality of the production. J-Zone has managed to craft some inventive beats with retro samples that seem to be taken from an old amusement park. He uses violin, trumpet and accordion samples blended with plucked loops that result in a catchy and unique sound. J-Zone is also a good MC that blesses us with sarcastic and vicious rhymes. His lyrics may not be 'deep or conscious' but they manage to be clever enough to be funny and dope.Overall this is a consistently strong album that stands way above average Hip Hop releases and you should definitely check it out."
4,Tons of Personality,"Personality is so important in hip-hop. Sure, you need a tight flow and killer production (which J-Zone has) but you are nothing without personality. The way J-Zone gushes about wanting Lucy Liu, bragging about how he is going to get a phat Caddilac, his feelings on using condoms, and lots of other details make this record endlessly interesting, and a hell of a lot of fun. J-Zone is one of the freshest MCs/DJs/producers in hip-hop today. It's artists like this that make digging a little deeper for new music so worthwhile."
5,Really helps wine last longer!!,We had lost 1 of the 2 that came with the original set and we just loved how it really vaccum seals well the wines so we bought more!!!! Really good specially with the reds.
2,No Packaging,I ordered these as a gift. They arrived at the recipient's house in a ziplock bag. No instructions. No product information. I can't believe Amazon would do something so tacky. Huge disappointment!
2,how do you use these things?,I am guessing that there is some other part that is necessary for these to work because they do not work.
4,"Little Pricey, but a must have",Overall I think this is a great product. I think the shipping and product was a little pricey but that's something that is typical.
1,do not mislead by the photo,The set of stoppers that was sent to me is not the same as the one shown in the picture. This set does not work. Would very much like to return it.
5,great gadget,"They work well at extending the life of wine in open bottles, resulting in savings far beyond their cost"
1,Cheap oversized knockoffs that leak,"As sold by CS Imports, these are not vacu vin wine savers, not even close. It looks like this seller found a very cheap manufacturer to produce something resembling vacu vin wine savers in cheap black rubber that doesn't fit bottle openings and is probably the reason the seals don't work because you have to jam them into any bottle opening misshaping the rubber.They arrived in tied plastic bags with no labeling. This seller probably bought 1000s of these knockoffs and sells them as vacu vins. Don't waste your money. The cost is just cheap enough that you won't want to bother sending them back, so let this be a warning."
5,Great product....saves multiple times in the wasted wine!,"Vacu Vin wine savers are a terrific idea, if one doesnt finish the bottles. One would almost waste the wine, or really drink it (nothing wrong with that!) if the bottle cannot be finished. But this produce ""allows"" one to enjoy the same wine for a couple of extra days, and hence pays for itself. This really works!"
5,tight seal,"Sometimes these stoppers don't seal tight enough, therefore really making them useless, but all four of these stoppers sealed perfectly."
1,Gloria: I Just Kept Hoping it Would Get Better!,"What a sad and bitter disappointment. This poorly written diatribe by Gloria Stuart, a faded silver screen legend, makes little attempt to recapture what it must have been like to be in Hollywood in its (or her) glory days. Instead she fills her book with innuendo and half truths and uses it as a vehicle to take a final stab at those who scorned her over the years. She bitterly attacks everyone, but most cold heartedly those who are no longer with us and are unable to defend their character or actions or to reveal the whole truth.In the hands of a better author, better storyteller and better person, this could have been a magical tale of a former legend recapturing the hearts of the America one last time. Instead it is a dripping, self-serving gossip rag that soils Ms. Stuart worst of all.This book is a sad embarrassment for not only its publisher but also its author, Ms. Stuart, undeniably a finer actress than she is a human being."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"I loaded ""Recover Lost Data - StompSoft ware"" onto my healthy C:drive. I wanted to recover data from a USB jumpdrive. The software came with an instruction manual in pdf format on the CD. When I attempted to access the instructions the computer continually shutdown and automatically restarted. The technical support from StompSoft after 7 days had not responded to my service request. It cost me $95 for a local IT person to reinstall WindowsXP and delete this software. It took me an additional 5 hours to reinstall the rest of my software."
3,Watch out. Does not include bci-6 black,Watch out. With all the confusing lettering and description -- it is hard to note that it does not include bci-6 blank ink tank. My printer i860 requires that. Other ink tanks are fine. I guess some other model printers don't require that.It is easy to miss that.
2,Would be good but my ink expires in July,"The ink seems to work quite well so far, I've printed several b&w; and color documents with no problems.The problem is that all 3 b&w; cartridges that I was sent expire on 7-20-10. I don't think I will be using more than one cartridge of b&w; by then so I'm probably going to get screwed on this one."
4,Good for the price,"The ink arrived pretty quick - didn't have to wait a long time. The only one we've installed so far is one of the red. The color on my printer seems a little off - a little too pink on people's faces, etc. - but I don't use this printer for printing photos, so I really don't care. If I were doing photos I'd likely stick to the brand name & pay more, but these are great for what I need. Can't beat the price! I can now print recipes & patterns, etc. without being so concerned with 'wasting ink' that's expensive. I didn't have ANY trouble installing - no leaking, etc. I just handled it carefully & it went in fine! I'd buy these again for sure."
1,Ink all over my hands!,"These cartridges leaked ink on my keyboard and hands during installation. I'm lucky it didn't get on my carpet. The mess isn't worth the savings. You're likely to do more damage than proper ink cartridges would cost. If you buy these, wear gloves and put remove the packaging over something you don't mind getting ruined."
1,First time using compatible ink,"And my experience is less thrilling. Pretty anything that requires color produces faded results, even after numerous nozzle cleaning. Ok for printing in black only but even some of the text is faded on various pages. Used in a Canon Pixma MP780. I literally threw this whole pack of 9 cartridges away and am ordering genuine Canon ink."
1,Don't Buy This Book,Colonol Robert Green Ingersoll would be outraged if he saw the condition this text is in. The book was clearly xeroxed from another document. The principle document was fine but the fool doing the xeroxing could keep his hand on the machine so every other page is black toner where his hand slipped. Pathetic! There is not one readable passage in this book.
2,Not what it seems,There are only two themed stencils in a package not the many the picture shows. I ordered this for my four year old daughter and recived airplane stencils (not pictured). The plastic seems tough enough but I thought I was receiving a package of at least 6 stencils with horses and clothing stencils as pictured. I won't even wrap this Christmas present. Buyer beware.
1,Fuggedaboudit stencils,"Fuggedaboudit. This stencil selection is useless. Not multiples, as photo shows. Posting states: ""Stencils (sold as single set. Each set includes 2 stencils & color guide) is just that, one 2-pc. set, NO choice for us on the stencils' subject. We received stencils of no interest. Avoid this purchase unless you have $6.70 to waste or want to play stencil roulette with the choice. Number of stars would like to assign: zero."
2,Where is Oasis?,This DVD does not hold up with nothing from Oasis on here. The best British band left off the biggest British Festival DVD. Does not make any sense to me. Who cares about Robbie Williams and Blur.
2,Dolby Digital 5.1 track is a lousy stereo... 48khz/16bit,"As I don't have an DVD Audio player, but a DVD Video one, I bought the disk knowing that there is also a 5.1 track (as written on the cover of the disk). But surprise... instead of a beautifull 5.1 compilation I found a lousy stereo... with the same quality as on CD. The disk was bought in France and I returned it the same day."
4,The Physiology Coloring Book,I found this book to be helpful as a reference material for my physiology class.
5,Color great learning media,I didn't realize how much quicker I learn with color added to learning process... will get more of these learning aids
3,when studying becomes fun,"I was sorry to see there were some missing pages on this books, the coloring ones! It looks entertaining and should be fun to work with. I can wait to have those color pencils ..."
4,Evolutionary Mechanisms,"""What keeps mobs of bacteria, insects, birds, and Jurassic kings and queens from lapsing into anarchy? What so consistently turns groups into social learning machines?"" Professor Bloom tells us he has observed five timeless and universal mechanisms: Conformity Enforcers, Diversity Generators, Inner-Judges, Resource Shifters and Intergroup Tournaments. Along the way from the Big Bang to the Internet (his optimistic predictions were unwarranted here), he confirms the fundamental evolutionary role of the archetypal Inner Judge (and, in primates, serotonin levels) and, further, the fundamental role of (typology and) Jung's psychological types (extraversion vs introversion) in shaping human social groups and subcultures. There are only 223 pages of text -- the notes, references and bibliography for all that Bloom so expertly and methodically weaves run 129 pages -- so Global Brain is a much quicker read than you would think."
5,Wonderful!,I enjoyed the story very much and can not wait to continue the adventure of a very admirable family in the next book!
4,A Solid Debut Effort!,"Baddy Doub is a great album. But not Elissa's best. She did so much better with Ayshallak (2002), Ahla Dounya (2004) and Bastanak (2006). But this doesn't mean this album doesn't contain great songs.Recommended Tracks:Baddy Doub, Helm El Ahlam and Zaalan."
1,Finally this dumb show is over.....,"They finally ended this show after several years, and endless times that Jessica Biel had bad taste in boyfriends (both on and off camera). Actually she left the series in disgrace, but that was unavoidabale because this was a garbage show both in concept and casting."
3,An alright/unrealistic show,"This show is a great family show. Although I never understood how all of the kids could have the same problems at the same time...and then are able to solve life problems...in an hour...and still be at home for dinner! Anyways...its a great show, and it has kept me interested in it for years! This also is not the best season...but hopefully the will produce more seasons on DVD soon!"
5,Amazing!!!,This show is awsome! It is without a doubt my favorite show! The first two seasons are out on dvd and I am hope that they will release the third season soon!
5,Awesome TV series!!!!!! Highly Recommended,"I absolutely love this show. It's good wholesome family TV. I love that it involves religion (though I am not a religious person). This show incorporates it so well that you don't even realize it, and if you do, you forget after a while. But the values it teaches and the issues the show deals with, are real life, and it's nice to see such a functional family have such disfunctional moments."
4,Makes fresh pineapple easy!,"I have always loved fresh pineapple, but hated trying to cut one up. This little gadget solved my problem. It is easy to use. The three blades are great for different size fruit. An excellent tool!"
4,it works,"not perfect, but worth having. sometimes the core is not lined up with the corer and that makes yoru rings have some core. sometimes there can be a lot of perfectly good flesh left in the shell (just scrape it out with a spoon). BUT despite these flaws, I use mine every week."
4,"two of three sizes useless, but it works well","Overall, the product works well, and it makes prepping a pineapple a snap. However, two of the three sizes that come with the handle are so small, I don't see how they could be of any use. Who would ever buy a pineapple that small?! I was hoping for larger sizes, not smaller. Oh well. You can save a little and buy the single corer/slicer, or get this version in case you ever have occasion to core a miniature pineapple!"
4,"Great product, great price.","I tried this item shortly after I received it, man-o-man what and invention. I am very glad that I bought it."
5,Works far better than expected.,I am so pleased I took a chance on this really practical pineapple corer. No longer will pineapple be a chore. The growers should give them away!
4,Fresh fruit in 60 seconds.,The product performed as advertized. A pair of strong hands arerequired to make the job easy.
1,Kitchen,"Vacu Vin Pineapple Easy Slicer, Set of 3Recieved item in excellant shipping time!!! Love the product"
4,"Great idea, and It works",I used this 3 times so far and I was able to cut the Pinnapple with out a mess in under 30 Sec. It comes with 3 sizes so as long as the Pinnapple fits these 3 sizes you should not have much waste. It is easy to use and leaves the shell in full so you can use it for drinks.
4,The Doctors meet Omega,"This episode starred the first three Doctors. William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee. When I first watched it in 1986, it ticked me off. I got mad because Hartnell was only shown in it for a few minutes instead of being in the whole show like Troughton. But at the time I didn't know that Hartnell was ill and couldn't perform in the whole show.The Doctors had to battle another Time Lord named Omega who was sucking all of the energy from Gallifrey. They eventually defeated Omega and Gallifrey got a new power source. The Time Lords were so grateful that they gave the Doctor a new dematerialization circuit and freed him from his exile on Earth.This wasn't the greatest Pertwee episode but it was good. Buy it today. You won't be sorry."
5,Great video!!,I got this for my husband who is a long time Dr Who fan. He loved it!!! This is for the really devoted fan!!
2,Kind of disappointing....,"I will admit the wrestling footage is full & complete; my expectations were high on this. Maybe a more personal Flair; the plane accident was very lightly touched(7 Minutes). He is a more inspirational human being & when I met him once, he is a very gracious gentleman. Would have loved to seen that side more... but STILL worth getting..."
5,The Man!,"This is it!The price is resonable for over 10 hours of wrestling by the the man.All the early stuff you can imagine.Some of the commentary is great.Especialy when talking of leaving the NWA for the WWF with the NWA belt in tow.The match with HHH is ok but the tribute paid to him after the show.Shows how respected he is.The early days with Dusty,Garvin and Race brings back memories.Flairs first match.This shows how cocky he was going to be."
1,absolutely not my taste,"I didn't even read the book,because I found the projects horrible.I gave it to one of my friends who also gave it to somebody else because she found it also horrible.It shows lots of projects from different people,very modern and abstract.Definetely not what I was looking for.Don't get me wrong,I like modern art and I'm very open-minded.I just found it ugly to my taste.I even feel bad of talking like that about someone else's work.I'm sorry,I really hope someone likes it."
5,BEST Tennis,"This was my son's first tennis shoes!It's wonderfull. It's really tough and it will survive the daily routine of a toddler.I started with the size 7. Then 7.5, 8, and now I just got the 8.5!My son LOVES IT!"
1,"Not a ""video card""","This is not really a ""video card"". This is a adapter, it just adds a DVI port to a very specific on board video. Should not be labeled as a video card and should be labelled as a ""video adapter"" or ""video port adapter"". Even Silicon Image calls this a ""DVI Transmitter""."
3,it works,"This clock is cute and I think this mermaids design is the best one out there for babies! Had it almost a year and it works fine. I do have a complaint, and that is about the hands. They are white, not black as shown in the picture. In a dark baby's room it is impossible to tell the time. Not so much of a big deal now, but when I was nursing at night I had to put a small digital in the room because I couldnt see the clock hands in the dim light.But it works, and its cute!"
1,not very good at ALL,I'm not sure about the previous reader but I couldn't find any depth at all in this book. I mean I know it's a Harlequin and not exactly a high-class book but STILL. There wasn't any character development at ALL. Also I really did not like the premise that the female character would have slept with that old guy just because of the male character annoying her. I mean COME ON.
5,The best book in the Villains series.,"So what happens when two demons of the abyss want to do an experiment to discover if you can be evil and die noble. Well, they bring back Toade and hilarity ensues. That's all I've got to say. This book was brilliant and so much fun... yet it still had adventure and plenty of fantasy to spare. An awesome book and well worth the read."
5,Good item,This product was exactly as I'd hoped. It works well for archiving slides and fit into the binders I am using for my project. Very good value!
5,"A beautiful story, full of hope","AHAB'S BRIDE took me to a time and place that became so real I felt as though I were there, too. The characters and their journey together made me weep and laugh with them--incredibly rich and real. Hannah's internal journey from innocent young girl to mature woman, able to withstand difficulty with grace and dignity, is a story we can all take to heart and try to emulate. Ms. Gouge has created a beautiful story, with a language that draws one in and makes one want to stay for a long, long while. Highly recommended."
4,Funniest review I've ever read...,"OK, going outside the bounds a bit, but have to say that the previous review (yak farmer) is the funniest I've ever read on the internet... and I must say, I do read a lot of these. Just had to tip my faux suede hat to the reviewer. Thanks for making me laugh!"
1,Don't buy it!,"Have owned this machine for 2 years. Started out okay, but after a year or so...Document feeder does not workColor prints have lines/incorrect colorsPrinter will lock up and say ""clear paper jam"", when no paper jam exists. You have open the back access panel, then close it to reset the machine.Numerous problems getting the drivers to install.BEWARE!"
1,Not too happy with it...,"I bought one of these and returned it 2 days later.The printer is exceptionally loud, probably the loudest printer that I had ever owned. It makes several very loud clicking sounds when it starts a print job, and it continues to be loud throughout the entire print process.The ink tended to smear on high quality inkjet paper and photo paper, even when I tried the different paper/media settings in the printer set-up. The print quality was good, but there were too many streaks and artifacts to make the print-outs useable.The scanner light is always on, which I assume is to make sure that it can start a scan or fax job quickly. The downside to this, though, is that it wastes power and it shortens the life of the optics.It is a good first-try for a multifunction device with a document feeder, especially in this price range. I would definitely take a look at Xerox's next release in this model line."
3,Good for keeping pre-chilled wine cold,This product works well for keeping an already chilled bottle cool at the table. Ours won't chill a bottle of white wine from room temperature to drinking temperature. It would probably work well for bringing a bottle of room temperature red wine down to cellar temperature. Our only freezer is the one in our refrigerator. It would probably work better if frozen in a chest type freezer kept at a lower temperature.
3,Hatfield & McCoy VHS A&E Biography tape review,"I've seen this tape several times since I am a direct desendant of ""Devil Anse"" and I'm impressed with the film makers desire to stick to the facts. One part however that I disagree with is the downplaying of the Civil War and its effect on the feud. This debate will go on forever no doubt. Fact is that most of the McCoys were of the Union Army and most of the Hatfields were of the Conferate Army. When the war was declared over the sons of these two families had to come back into the same valleys and try to live as neighbors...so..""do the math""."
5,Finally after almost 2 years of waiting!!!,"Can't wait to see the fourth & last season of PUNKY BREWSTER. I always loved this show. Like I said on season's 3 review,this season was never viewed here in P.R. but dubbed in spanish in late 90's & it didn't cause any impact on viewers here cause people got use to the 2 pony tails colorful girlie PUNKY BREWSTER. On season 3 & 4 she still was colorful but more mature, but I still love the show & I am very overwhelmed that it's finally gonna be release on dvd after almost 2 years since season 3.This is the most unforgettable since the last episode is Brandon's wedding to Brenda!!! Weird but very beautiful finale for the show!!"
1,Could not relate,Do these people live in the real world? I mean who talks about people like this?I just thought this book did a terrible disservice to the human race.Hopefully these authors haven't written very many books.
3,It's a Kit - but not what I was hoping for...,"I guess I wish they would have listed exactly what was included. There were only two little samples of ""neosporin"" type stuff that we used practically on our first day out. Plenty of bandaids and things to wipe and clean wounds though I'll give them that. Other than guaze, all the bandaids were the same size, but that works in a pinch. I wish there were some head and pain relief type things included as well. Wouldn't bother buying this kid again - not what I anticipated."
4,Sometimes the Truth Hurts,"This is a wonderful book, but is doomed to be unpopular. It details the undeniable failure of the 'War on Drugs' and the lives ruined by the failed effort. Those who are able to make up their own minds on issues should read this book and not just be led along by the political rhetoric that is so popular today."
4,good value,this was bought as a gift. He had one and wore it out. I paid more (almost twice as much) for this on as the origional but he is happy and that is what is most important to me.
5,Hardback format,This is the hardback version ofPhysical Chem with Applicatns Life Sciences# ISBN-10: 9780805324020# ISBN-13: 978-0805324020# ASIN: 080532402X
4,worth the money for me.,"I am currently still using this exam review, and am finding it very useful. It divides AT into five separate categories, and it's easy to identify where your weak spots are...and what areas you need to study more closely. If you are taking the BOC in the next year, I would definately recommend using this book as a tool when studying."
2,"Palm Treo 650, 700w, 700p, 700wx Silicone Skin Case - Black","Nice colour!!! Excellent traction. Decent price. However, the case does not fit the phone snugly; in fact it is a little loose, especially at the bottom near the microphone and the entire case tends to move slightly as a result.. bloody annoying!!!! The designers should make the case to fit better. Definitely needs to be re-designed!!!"
2,not very good quality,I've been using this skin for about 2-3 weeks now on my treo 700. Let me first say that you usually get what you pay for. The Skin does not fit the phone very well and it looks cheap and generic. The one good point is that it does seem to protect the phone ok.
4,Nice story,I love this story. My children enjoy it. Its great for children at bedtime. It is actually a play....thats how the story is being told.Must add to your library of African tales!!
1,Pasture Pals a dissapointment,"I purchased the pasture pals for my daughter thinking that they would be solid plastic toys because of the price. Upon receiving the toys I discovered that they are really hollow white plastic horses covered badly by a fuzzy cloth to resemble fir, and it falls off quite easily. I now have thrown many of them away as their manes fall off and their fur peals back to expose the white plastic beneath. I've only had the horses for a couple weeks. I'm very dissapointed."
3,Linty Little Things.,I bought these for my twin 4-year old daughters for Christmas and they have a lot of fun playing with them. My major complaint is unless you lie the box flat and store it under the bed (or where ever you have room) the horses tend to fall out easily. Also they collect a lot of lint over time. Every little hair or piece dust seems to stick to them which can be annoying. Other than that they are pretty fun.
2,Cheap,"Bought this for my niece and returned it. Great price, but the horses themselves look like they came out of a gumball machine. In China."
4,My 7 year old LOVES these delicate little horses,"My 7 year old LOVES, LOVES these delicate little horsesThey are different and more realistic then other model horses. They are delicate. She took good care of them because she loved them so much. They are like little GEMS to her. WATCH OUT if you have DOGS...These are a yummy chewy toy to dogs..they will track them down and just wait to move in and grab them.. my teacup 3 lb poodle could not resist over time she stalked everyone of these toys when my daughter wasn't looking. She would grab them as fast as she could and DESTROY in one Shot! My daughter was so upset CRYING!!!! I am now going to buy another set for Christmas. It was the first thing on her list. I hesitant because of how delicate they are but what really matters is how much she enjoys them and hopefully learns she will just have to keep them off the floor so the FiFi (dog) doesn't get them. A lesson to learn on her part.."
5,Hours of cooperative play for little girls who love horses.,My nieces loved these horses and played with them non-stop for weeks after receiving their gift.
2,Sad little plastic toys...DISPLAY only...dont waste your $$$,"we received this set as a gift for our then 2 1/2 year old son. I was really excited because we love all the Melissa & Doug puzzles and he loves horses! After about 1 week of playing with them, several of the horse's ""coats"" began to peel off the plastic toy. So now we were left with a sad display case (empty) and several sad little bald horses all over the play room. I think this would be nice for DISPLAY only. For horse lovers, buy some inexpensive ones at your local Big Lots and save the $$ for the well made items."
4,coping with predisone,"a pretty informative book especially if you are on pred. for a very long period of time, even though it does effect people differently, it does give an idea of how to cope with things. recommend for people to buy."
4,"The ""Bible"" for those on Prednisone","WHen my husband was put on a high dose of Prednisone and began having severe reactions to it, I looked for help to really understand what was happening--a friend mentioned this book so I got it and immediately felt like I had a real support system in place!! When my husband felt well enough to read anything, he also read it, underlining key passages, saying that it addressed his concerns and what he was experiencing--he is better now and weaned off of the Prednisone--hopefully won't need any more as the side effects are extraordinary! but thanks, Eugenia et al., for writing this guide!!!"
5,Great value!,"Girlfriend loved it! Everyone asked where she got it! Certainly an excellent deal, and just as described!"
2,Interesting read but not top notch,"The book LA Exposed is an interesting read, but not being from California, a lot of the legends and myths were unknown to me. I think this book would be a lot more entertaining if you knew of the legends prior to reading the book. However, I learned a lot and would recommend the book if you are interested in learning unusual stories from the LA area."
3,Begging for more details,"While I do really enjoy this set, after watching it twice I still feel disappointed that so much of the material is ""candy coated."" Possibly it's too much to ask of just 6 hours of video, but each segment I watched had me begging for more information & technical detail (maybe that's a good thing?) They certainly covered all of the ""Who, What, and When"" but left out much of the ""How and Why."" My overall experience was still quite positive, and I certainly learned an extra history lesson or two along the way. I guess it's ""back to school"" if I want to know all of the gory details."
2,Not for people people who practice the Chans family styleCLF,"I think this book gives a good introduction to CLF and it's basic s but if you as me study the chans family style, I suggest you don't buy the book! I bought it and found out that many of the movements we practice are not the same as the ones in this book! This can confuse both you and your sifu! For example the basic movement Ng Lun Ma that we practice is not the same as the one in the book at all."
1,Rigged reviews!,"All of the ""great"" reviews of this film are from people either starring in or involved with the making of this film. I did buy the film. Have not received it yet...but, I have watched clips on myspace. This is shot on video. (need I say more). I am sure it is a movie that I may only watch once. I enjoy ""different"" films. I feel that the low, low production values ""suck"". Seems the only way to appreciate this movie is to either star in it or been involved with the production of it, judging by the ""actual"" reviews."
2,A Moderately Low Budget Film,The acting is fairly good and the film is moderately budgeted. The only problem I had with it was there needed to be more sex scenes. When you consider the story line is that they are abducting women and using them to make babies - There should be more sex scenes. It is a softcore film - there aren't any scenes showing penetration. I don't think I would recommend paying $15 for this film like I did. Id say maybe $5 or $10 at most.
4,I like it,I wanted some details about my future career as a psychologist. This book is helpful because it is detailed and specific. Each chapter expounds upon a different caree focus.
4,Lynette Jensen has done it again,"This Thimbleberries book is a must. The book contains over 140 pages of easy detailed instructions to make the beginner quilter a success. Each of the 22 projects are easy for beginners and intermediate quilters. Pillows, table runners, place mats, wall hangings and quilts for every room. Motifs include apples, pumpkins, oak leaves, baskets, mittens and more. Try these projects and your friends and family will think you a genious."
3,Shorter life than APC UPS,"I bought it due to its lower price. It worked for a little over 3 years. First the battery died. 3-year battery life is acceptable. Then before I ordered a replacement battery, the whole thing was dead. Press down power button, nothing. Opened it up and checked the fuses. They were ok. So didn't know where the fault was. Will send it to recycle. I have used many APC UPSes and Liebert UPSes. APC's unit last much longer (battery: 4-6 years, unit: 10+ years. I have a couple of units purchased in 1994-1998 still running strong). I am on market searching for a new UPS. This time it'll be an APC."
5,as a teacher,"I truly enjoyed this book. Sometimes as an adult you forget that kids are going through their experiences in life for the first time. This book helps the teen as well as the adult to understand that we too have gone through what they have. We can relate to their issues. AND this book had alot of relating issues to true life!!! I found it uplifting, tear producing, and full of laughs as well."
5,Give This Book To Your Sister!,"My sister gave me this book for my 40th birthday, and I stayed up all night reading it. This is a novel for and about sisters. What insight into sisterhood! And what a gripping, tender story about three very different women."
2,Boring,"This is the second book I've read by this author, and although it American Pie is better than She Flew the Coop, it still wasn't good. It semed to be building up to an interesting tale, but then it just ended. The characters were quite interesting, but the story fell flat. Apparently I was one of the few who didn't like it though, so if you enjoy southern, gentle fiction you may want to check it out from the library."
4,these are 2 of the best two episodes of the first season,"The first episode deals with ""the strangler,"" while the second deals with the foster boy that accidently shoots Kelly in the head. As an avid CA fan, I enjoyed both these episodes, and only wish amazon offered the rest of the series."
3,Bible,This was a beautiful Bible and arrived in good time and good condition. I had wanted Large Print and this was only medium print once I got it. Good value for this purchase.
3,Was expecting a real leather cover,"Content is good, however the item description is misleading. It was advertised as Leather cover, but the actual cover was a budget faux leather."
3,"Concert good, audio mixing variable","Initially I was disappointed with the DVD concert. The audio started out horrible (in PCM or dts or DD5.1), however it wasn't the DVD's fault, it was the mixing engineer at the time. As the concert progresses, you can tell when each microphone or instrument input gets adjusted to the correct level, and by the time the concert is 45 minutes or so old, the audio is fine. Unfortunately, that first handful of songs has very poor mix, and that ruins the concert, at least at the beginning. The video is good, not pristine, but good, and in 16:9 though not anamorphic. Overall, unless you're a Moodies fan, you probably won't be impressed with it. If you are a fan, then it's worth the price."
5,Fun and Entertaining,"This is a great DVD for fans of the Moody Blues. The sound quality isn't exactly top notch but the video truly captures the band in concert. The Moodies are having fun during this set, and it carries over to the viewer. I especially enjoyed Ray Thomas's ""Legend of a Mind"" and Justin Hayward's superb guitar playing. The sound problems, through half of the DVD, provide a few windows of John Lodge's bass work. Graeme Edge shows why he is such an outstanding drummer. The background singers also are showcased as well as the other musicians."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I loved this DVD. I've seen The Moody Blues live in concert probably a dozen times and have not seen them as ""animated"" as they were on this DVD. Justin Hayward was the best I have ever seen him. This version of Nights In White Satin is breath taking. Absolutely wonderul. It's a must for any ""true"" Moody Blues fan."
3,"Do the crime, serve the time.",One easily forgets that the grandmother had as much right to her life as the teenagers did. They committed this murder and should be punished accordingly. There is little sympathy for cold blooded killers who use age and circumstances as excuses for their behavior.
3,You must buy this product if you have Targus Wireless mouse,"You must buy this product if you have Targus Wireless mouse. Without cradle batteries have to be changed about every month or two. When I bought this cradle I thought that I will charge my mouse using USB. This is not true. Cradle should be actually plugged both in the outlet and into USB. As a result, I have now much more wires around my computer that I would have if I have bought just usual mouse. If you have a mouse, buy a cradle. If you are looking for a mouse do not buy wireless."
5,Very useful for jazzstudies,I bought this book for my beginning jazz studies on guitar. You have to do a lot of homework but it will pay back.I am very pleased with the book and can highly recommend it to start your jazz chord studies whith.
1,Buyer Beware!,"The battery type does not match what they list. The batteries they sent came dead and I had to buy 2 new expensive batteries. I tried multiple times to contact the company, Plexon Inc. both by email and by phone and had ZERO luck getting them to respond. They charge $8 shipping on two tiny pointers.The laser pointers worked fine after I paid to replace the batteries. I would NEVER buy from this company again."
3,Like Magdelena...this girl's funny!,"I didn't much care for the plot of this story or the boiler plate murder mystery formula, and wish that the author would spend more time on the storyline, but I sure like the character. I liked the fact that she was making a new life for herself after her snake of a husband leaves her for a younger model.I've read all of this author's Penn-Dutch mysteries and liked them. I'm looking forward to reading more Den of Antiquity mysteries.I like the wit and dry humor of Tamar Myers...she makes me laugh out loud...Enjoy!"
3,Larceny and Old Lace,"I just cant identify with this series and have stopped collecting these books. I believe, however, that the books are a cut above most ""mysteries"" that are being published today."
5,The same?,"Is the the same documentary as the one from 1996 with the same Title? I just ordered the other one, and was wondering if I should get this one as well. But I don't want to spend money on duplicates.Please help me out here =)"
2,So So,"As file jackets go, this one is only so so as far as durability goes. I've stuffed them full of the children's last year's school papers and projects and they showed wear at the seams quickly - not what you want in a folder filled with papers. I think I will stay with the brand I get at Staples."
3,Great but smells bad,"I would have given this five stars, first tried it out at my biofeedback/ ergo specialists office, but when I ordered mine, they smell like burnt plastic, I don't know what 's up with it! I called the company, they told me to let it air out a few days. So we'll see..."
4,Better than most,I've tried a few of these palm rests for mice and find these one of the best. I really like that they have a material on the bottom that prevents any sliding. And you get two for the price of one. And the material they use doesn't cause your hand to sweat. My only complaint is that they are just a tad to high to be comfortable throughout the day for all day-usage. But they work great with my wireless mouse.
5,"Product has a great software suite, as well...","The card does come with Audio Surgeon LE - as it is clearly advertised. If that's not what you wanted when you bought the card - you could have always returned the product. And if the user wanted Audio Surgeon, why wouldn't they simply buy that product?This is a great card with:Optical S/PDIF output for pass-through of Dolby Digital and DTS multi-channel DVD sound to external A/V receiversSelectable 2, 4, or 6 analog line output channelsExternal line inputInternal CD and Aux inputsSupports Game Surround Sound APIs such as EAX, A3D, I3DL2 and DirectSound 3D supportConverts stereo sound sources to multi-channel formatEnvironmental EffectsGame port for dual analog joystick connectionYou can't get a software suite like it with other cards, and for under $30 (the cost of Audio Surgeon by itself, by the way) you get a great product."
5,Awesome!!,"I absolutley love this sweatshirt. I bought this item for a Marine Corps birthday party. The Marines loved it. I'm not a Marine, but my dad, brother and uncle are. It came quickly, and the quality of this item are fantastic. I highly recommend it."
1,remote for avic z2,dont wasre your money on this remote i purchased for my stereo avic z2 because touch screen wont work so i thought i could bypass touch screen menu by this remote let me tell u only volumne button works thats the only thing and nothing else works big dissappointment
2,Santaland Diaries,"As a writer myself it's encouraging to see that David Sedaris was once not a very good writer, who became a very good writer. But in this book his skills are weak."
4,my take on it,"Business reading. Not a fun summer read but did give interesting, well researched facts as the author was able to interview the subject, Edith Bolling Wilson."
4,COPPER...ALMOST BETTER THAN GOLD..WELL....ALMOST!,"PERMATEX HAS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND LIKE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS THEY PRODUCE, THIS IS TOPS.THIS IS THE ONLY ANTI-SIZE THAT CAN GO FROM BREAKS, TO HIGH HEAT TO WET USES. I USED THIS ON BRAKE BLEEDER SCREWS TO CALIPERS TO DOOR HINGES...THE ONLY REASON WHY IT DIDNT GET A 5 STAR RATING IS THAT ITS MESSY. THE APPLICATOR IS TO LARGE AND SLOPPY AND CAN NOT BE USED IN DETAIL APPLICATIONS. I USE A Q-TIP INSTEAD AND ALL IS WELL.I PLACE MY ORDER WITH AMAZON AND I HAD IT IN MY SHOP IN TWO DAYS...."
3,Live Through the 70's,I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband. It wasn't what we thought it would be. He didn't even finish watching the DVD because he was disappointed.
3,Risk Analysis: A Quantitative Guide,"I purchased this book to learn to write simulation equations in excel but only found it was a manual ( type book ) with good information for a very expensive software I did not have....If you have RISK software, it is a great book to have... I returned my copy w/o scanning the entire book."
3,Where No man has Gone...,"A mildly amusing parody of Star Trek. This thin book reads more like a short story than a novel. Certainly could have been better, but not a bad 2-hour read. Personally, I thought Dechancie's 'Castle Perilous' books were funnier."
4,Excellent booster seat,"I purchased this seat for both my 5 year old and my 3 1/2 year old. Even though they are 18 months apart, they are about the same size and weight. Both fit very comfortably in the seat (even though they are both barely above 35 pounds). The seat belt shoulder adjuster is great and they do not complain about the seat belt hitting across their neck. The cup holders may be useful (I did not put them in) but my kids are not allowed to have drinks in the car so I do not know if they get in the way. I do agree with other people that to carry the entire seat is difficult because of the way the seat back folds, but since it folds, it does fit in a trunk for transportation very well. My only other complaint would be the arm rests do not lift up so it makes it a little more challenging to reach around and tuck the seat belt in to buckle it in the car. Otherwise, it is a great seat and I am planning to purchase 2 more for my husband's car."
1,"""Nude"" is ORANGE!","I was a fan of this product when it was sold in a color called ""Light Beige."" Unfortunately, it seems like that color is no longer manufactured, and has been replaced by ""Nude."" Since I am very fair with practically transparent skin, I bought the nude color. As soon as I tried it, I hated it. Compared to the old Light Beige, which has a brown undertone with a bit of shimmer, Nude is very orange. This product does not look like stockings on me anyway, but the Light Beige color is much better. I hope they bring it back."
2,NOT her best,"Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorite authors (Howl's Moving Castle is my personal favorite) but this book seemed like an idea for a story. The characters, while well researched, were not developed at all. I couldn't connect with any of them, not even the main character. Jones came up with some interesting ideas like the mythosphere, but that's all they were- ideas. After I finished the last page, I felt like I had missed a chapter somewhere. Over all, I was rather disappointed."
4,Too short,"I liked this story, but it wasn't among my favorite Diana Wynne Jones books. I think that's because it was so short - a lot of things are left pretty vague, and while the concept is imaginative and creative with the best of them, I wished that there was more detail, to make this world more real. I guess I would call this story more ""clever"" than ""immersive,"" if that makes sense. So, 4 stars for an interesting story, anyway :)"
2,Disappointing for my purposes,"I purchased this paper for double sided printing, and found too much see-through, despite the claims in its description."
5,Best paper I've ever used!,"I self-published a book using Hammermill 24-lb bright white paper, and I can't say enough great things about it (the paper, not the book). The book is a transcription of my great-aunt's diaries from the 1880's and I scanned each yellowed page and printed it, with my transcription next to it. The ink is faded & the handwriting hard to decipher, which is why I typed out everything, but I wanted people to see how the actual diary pages looked. I needed a heavyweight paper to keep all that color ink from bleeding through on both sides, and Hammermill's did the trick! I used it for my Christmas letters, too, and printed photos on both sides of the paper. Now I use Hammermill for everything. It has a heavy, smooth feel to it which I really like, too. Now all other paper feels flimsy and rough to me. I've tried HP's 24-lb bright white paper and I like Hammermill's better."
3,Hippo Eats Dwarf,Hippo Eats Dwarf is a story that a lot of American's can relate to. It is the story of obesity.The story is told of a female trapeze artist called Ursula Shipton who due to an accident is unable to continue her high flying work. Due to these she quickly gains wait and notoriety for eating just about anything. It finally gets to a stage where she has to choose between continuing her glutinous ways or doing the right thing.Overall the book is light hearted written well. 3 out of 5
4,Grat book,Absolutely loved this book and how it uncovers hoaxes. Very well written but not so overly wordy or intellectual as to sound snobbish.
3,rather disappointing Da Vinci Code cash in,Despite the book's outlandish claims this is probably the worst diet plan since Atkins and I am yet to loose any weight after 6 months of hippo salads. Avoid.
3,Lesson Learned?,"I am a middle-school teacher. I showed this video to my students with a worksheet to focus their attention. The worksheet had three sections: 1)List 10 facts about Leonardo di Vinci 2)List 5 facts about living in Leonardo's time 3)List the three things you know now that you did not before seeing this film. My students learned that Leonardo di Vinci was a homosexual and that he wrote backwards. Although they wrote many interesting facts about Leonardo, one week later these two items were about all that they could recall."
1,Extremely disappointing,A bland account that doesn't go very deeply into the subject and fixates more on the possibility of Da Vinci being homosexual than on the accomplishments and other interesting points of the mans life.Certainly not worth the money spent to buy it or the time to view it.
3,NICE,"This record is some seriously good hip hop.Straight forward approach, no gimmicks.These two can really throw down on the mic. They handle it.Buy this record... and buy anything else they put out if you love hip hop."
5,Fresh batteries delivered fast at a fair price,Hard to say much about a battery - mine were fully charged and arrived quickly.
1,BEWARE BUYING THESE...,"I bought these Jan. 2012. My Voice Alert system will tell me when battery charge is low and the last 5 ""new"" batteries I've put in has triggered the low battery alert. I will not be buying alkaline batteries from Amazon in the future if they're sending me ""new"" batteries with no charge left or can't vouch for the freshness of their products."
5,Light,"So far this light works well, it shuts off and turns on at yhe perfect time. I hope to save some money with this light it has the energy star rating and the package says it will save you 75%"
3,Very Intertaining Book,Very entertaining read. A flight attendent sharing some humorous moments with the traveling public. If you wondered what goes on with the flight attendants this is a good book to read. However I think this guy has to much drama during his time in the cabin.
4,"United, obviously.","While the author does not name the airline he worked for its a safe bet that such a 3rd rate carrier out of Chicago would have to be you-know-who.Some of the stories are very funny and some are ""Dave Barry"" funny--which is to say, almost funny. The author does come off as a bit mean spirited."
5,Capturing Air Travel Culture,"This book, ""Planeinsanity,"" encapsulates, in brilliant language, the culture of air travel. The author's fast paced tales, beautifully spiced with countless analogies that reference behaviors and situations embracing almost every apect of culture, inform the reader about a flight attendant's view of the world inside a ""tin tube"". It is a book that is informative, humorous, captivating, and one of the best that I have read on the subject of commercial air travel. I've already begun to read it for the second time."
2,I was hoping for so much more.,"I was expecting a lot of laugh-out-loud humor from this book. Instead it is mostly filled with anonymous, tame and predictable stories. At least it's a quick read."
3,I laughed once...,"It was an ok book to read, it was not hilarious like other readers said it was. The author tried his best trying to make it funny, and that is what ruined it. The first reviewers must have been family."
4,Interesting Reading on a Flight !,"I happened to share 2 nights with the author Mr.Hester on a train journey from New Delhi to Bangalore India and made acquaintance with a man who certainly has ""seen it all"" on board during his long tenure within USA !It was also a sheer coincidence that I was working with a major european airline myself and so the common platform we shared was indeed interesting ! Having experienced almost every facade of passenger profiles on the ground and since Mr.Hester has every experience to share onboard, perhaps we could both write a book oneday !His book is definitely hilarious from all directions and his lucid style in expressions will keep you rivetted on your seat, and should you be reading this book on a flight - watch out for anything to happen - around you !Simply hilarious, and his style is unique !"
2,A good book if you know the author,"When I'm out with a friend and he tells me stories about his life, we all have a good laugh. But that's often because I care about my friend, and I'm intersted in things that happen to him. Try putting such stories in a book for strangers to read, and it flops. Unfortunately, this is what Hester seems to have done in Plane Insanity. I suspect that over drinks one time, a friend of his told him he should write. So now Hester has published a collection of stories that is quite uninteresting, unless you happen to be his mom or best friend. Yes, people sometimes throw up on planes. Yes, people sometimes get angry when they have been wronged. My advice: skip the book, and go out for drinks with a friend."
2,Metaphorical Insanity.,"Boring tales inundated with superfluous metaphors. You'd think the author prayed to the god Metaphor morning, noon, and night for inspiration."
3,Interesting,"I thought the content in this book was quite informational as I have never know anyone who was a flight attendant. It was quite comical and believable as to how some humans act under some extreme circumstances. For the price, I would recommend this to anyone wanting a light read."
1,Junk!!!!!!!,"I purchased this a little over a year ago and the coating has already come off. Sad part is I have another ""no name"" 8 inch pan that I have had for four years (I needed 2) and it is still in pristine condition even though I have used it 4 times as long. In addition the company has no customer feedback or assistance on their website.Don't waste your money!!!"
2,Poor coverage,Print was washed out couldn't produce a good black everything tended to be gray even on HQ setting. Buy the brother brand as this was a waste in the end except for rough drafts but who has time to swap out cartridges based on quality of work desired.
5,Still a Winner,"This was the first book I ever bought when I decided to try my hand at free weights at home. I used it for about three years solid, then began working with a personal trainer to really up my workouts. Recently I quit the trainer and have built up my own little home gym, and guess what - I'm back to this same book all these years later. I've found that even though I've got a lot more experience now, and have built up good muscle tone, I can still use this workout because of the advanced options she offers to add-on to each routine. It worked for me as a beginning book and helped me get started on my road to better fitness, and seven years later, it's still helping me stay in shape. I have some of her other books, too, and they are all in heavy rotation in my weekly workout routines. Some of the best books out there for all levels of weight trainers, in my opinion. But this particular one is still the best!"
1,Beta version passing as full retail version,"I have never bought a piece of software that works SO badly. It turns out the product is extraordinarily particular about which drives it supports, which brand of media, etc. And the list of known issues with mainline software (listed on their 'README' offered to you during the installation) is staggering. My experience with Roxio CD and DVD Creator would be comical if it were'nt so sad. I would be extremely wary of this product...if you could see the type and frequency of problems and complaints in the Roxio web discussion groups, you'd be shocked that this product isn't being recalled. It should be. An utter waste of money."
2,Cat-owners Beware,"These sheets are indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old 100% cotton 400-thread count (and VERY expensive) sheets, but are much thinner, surprisingly, suggesting more delicate threads. This fact was borne out when less than a month after starting to use them, one of my cats ""kneaded"" on the bed with his claws, and the sheet was irreparably shredded. This has never happened before with ANY sheets I have owned in 40 years of multiple cat owning. Sure, I've gotten thread pulls and tiny little holes in other sheets, but not the knife-like cuts that appeared with these sheets, after just one kneading session. It really looked like someone had taken a pair of scissors and stabbed the sheet repeatedly. Despite the high thread count, this cotton is thin and delicate. So beware if you are a pet-owner. You do get what you pay for with these inexpensive sheets."
1,Stiff and itchy,"I was incredibly disappointed with these sheets after reading the rave reviews. After two washes, they were still very stiff. Additionally, there's something in the sheets that makes me feel very itchy, which has never happened with other sheets. On the plus side, they don't wrinkle, but since they're too itchy to sleep on, the wrinkle-free quality does me no good anyway."
5,"Deep Fitting, Soft, and Well Priced","I was looking for sheets for my new bed which is a pillow top and seemed to be having little luck finding something resaonablly priced that would fit. These sheets are perfect, they even have some material left over to push up under the mattress. I washed them and put the on my bed the day I got them and they were so soft. They get softer with every wash and there is no pilling. These sheets are a great price and I highly recomend them for yourself or even as a gift. The price makes it well worth it."
4,goodstuff!,"ThisCDwas better than I expected!Makes a great party record!insert doesn't say if this CD was remastered.If it wasn't the production values are great.Also,these guys are very good musicians."
5,Exquisitely breathtaking.,"I happened by accident (is there ever an accident?) to have the Soundscapes channel on my digital cable and one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard in years played. The song was called ""Common Places"" by an artist named Starr Parodi from the CD of the same name. I was instantly moved beyond words. In the past few months I have heard three musical statements that have touched my soul deeply: Mychael Danna's soundtrack to the film ""Water"", Maneesh De Moor's CD ""Sadhana"" with the incredibly haunting piano piece ""Pure Essence"", and as of tonight Starr Parodi's ""Common Places"". The emotion in Starr's playing reminds me of the depth of my late mother Barbara's piano playing. Memories of those I have loved and lost pour into me and I am touched by that longing (en Espanol ""Anello"")that reminds us of our eternality. Shades of George Winston, Bruce Hornsby, and Keith Jarrett.What beauty! Thank you.Om Sai Ram, Om Shanti Shanti Shanti."
4,Good 80's CD,"I grew up in the 1980's and this cd takes me back to simpler time. I listen to this cd when getting ready for work and dance across the room. I was really happy and surprised to find my favorite dance song, Together Forever on it. I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to put a beat to their step and also remembers the 80's"
5,These books capture you. they suck you in & don't let go.,"these books have style. they're great.they got up there with star wars.they've got humor,action,& they are'nt so far fetched as other books i've read."
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All I can say about this book is that it is the stupidest book I ever read.
3,Not compatible with other sheds/roundhouses,"My 3-year-old received this for Christmas, and was very disappointed to learn that this turntable does not work with the Brio roundhouse (I think it's specifically for the Thomas one). It does not fit into the ramps leading to the individual sheds. We found a way to make it work by placing it in the middle of our track set up -- and having the turntable function in the middle of the Island of Sodor. But, if you have anything other than the Thomas roundhouse, look for the turntable that matches it."
4,My grandson loved playing with this toy.,"I purchased this toy along with the Thomas Round House. My Grandson loved playing with both, especially turning the trains around on the Round About."
1,Are they really valid checks?,"I've considered buying this or similar check printing products. However, are the checks really acceptable to the bank? The line of data at the bottom of checks is supposed to be printed with magnetic ink so that check processing equipment can read it. (It's called the MICR line for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition.)If the MICR line is printed in normal non-magnetic ink from a laser jet or ink jet, the item rejects when processed by the bank and the bank must manually process the check which is a hassle and much more expensive. Many banks--like mine--reserve the right to reject check stock that doesn't include the correct ink on the MICR line. The bank can send the customer a letter asking them to stop using the unapproved check stock or reluctantly close the account.If this product does print the MICR line with approved magnetic ink, then I'd like to see it in the product description."
2,Buyer Beware - Now Made in China!,"Although the Reed & Barton Country French pattern is lovely, it is now MADE in CHINA! I purchased a 5-piece place setting to add to my existing set. Much to my disappointment, it is now made in China. Not only am I concerned about using this flatware for food since the metal it is made of is questionable, but there is also a definite change for the worse in quality. For example, the ""made in China"" dinner fork weighs 1.4 oz vs 1.9 oz for the original dinner fork. That 0.5 oz makes a big difference in heft and feel. Very disappointing."
4,The same quality as elsewhere for a better price,"I registered at Dillard's for this flatware for my wedding. I really like the pattern, and it goes with my china pattern as well. Unfortunately, it isn't sold in large sets, so I have to buy one place setting at a time.I have used the flatware a few times for gatherings at my house. It functions just fine for eating and I have had no problems cleaning it in the dishwasher.I can't tell the difference between the place settings I got from Dillard's or the ones I bought at Amazon for a much lower price."
4,P-Funk Continues,"As a funkateer-to-the-grave, I very much enjoyed watching one of the most innovative bands perform after their hey-day. They've still got it! George Clinton introduces his granddaughter to the stage and the funk spreads to another generation. The musicians are fantastic, although some of the original members are not performing in this show. You will enjoy this DVD."
3,Contents of This CD,The main reason I bought the CD was due to two selections; Because the Night and There's Something Going On (a cover of the Frida song). Both are the short versions but still quite good. Taleesa is a featured artist on some of the selections.Tracks:1) Temptation 4:012) 4 Your Love 4:263) Because The Night 4:344) I Break Down & Cry 5:505) Over and Over 5:026) I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight 4:417) Get Over It 4:018) There's Something Going On 3:449) Was It So Bad For You 4:5010)Mirror Man 4:0411)Dorian Gray (The Painting) 3:42
1,Bad Topic/Mediocre Author,"As I read books on entrepreneurship, I am begining to believe the topic to be a difficult, if not impossible one upon which to write a paperback. The topic of entrepreneurship is simply very, very broad. Shefsky's book provides extremely good evidence to support my aurgument. The book reads as though the author wrote with an unconventional act of will. A similar will will be required to read it."
2,Cherry Finish Swing Arm Brass Lamp Magazine Table,"I read the reviews before I purchased the lamp table so I knew I wasn't ordering a quality item. The table is rather flimsy but will serve the purpose until I can find something better-made in a local furniture store. Don't even bother trying to put the lamp shade together as it's a piece of junk. Rather, just go out and buy a lamp shade at Target or Wal Mart. In the meantime, it provides a lamp to read by and a place for guests to set a cup of coffee."
4,Great Tent,We got this tent because we needed more space for our new arrival. It was great! There was enough space for the play pen and a queen size mattress for us to sleep on. The set up was very quick and the tent feels sturdy. I took away one star because the pole that goes over the door for the rain fly busted in half (amazon promptly sent us a new one). Other than that we are very pleased with this tent.
2,Not what expected!,this tent is not what I expected. It appears far roomier and spacious than it really is. Also the tent is not square as pictured. It is more of a hexagon shape (with 5 sides) It is difficult to position an air mattress. YOu certainly could not fit 2 full size air mattresses in the tent! Would not recommend!
3,"Good spoons, cheap ring","Love the ease of using long-handled, square spoons for measuring things like xanthan gum, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon.These particular spoons are a nice weight and well made. However, the ring that holds them together is very cheap and rusted after the first washing. I replaced it with a cheap car-key ring that has yet to rust. What's up with that?For ease of use, I also split the spoons onto two separate rings - bigger and more commonly-used spoons on one ring, and smaller, less-commonly used ones on the other ring. This greatly improved the ease of handling, washing and drying. I would recommend that Norpro sell them in this two-ring configuration AND use rings that don't rust."
3,Sturdy and Slim,"I like that it came with the pinch and dash measurements and are a great shape for my spice containers. They are sturdy but the edges are a bit rough and catch, I might try sanding them. The handles for the 3 small sizes also have straight sides where the larger ones have a notch which makes it not appear as a set which is in the picture but not clearly."
4,Greek Crazy!!,"""Stomp The Yard: Homecoming"" was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed from start to finish. Not only did I enjoy the movie, but my entire family did as well. It was one of our visual entertainments during the 2010 Christmas holiday. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to each and everyone. And I hope to see yet a THIRD installment in the entertaining franchise."
1,Worst movie I have seen this year!,"There is nothing like wasting your money on a rental. Thank the Lord I did not purchase this DVD because it was horrible. I just finished watching Stomp the Yard II. Unfortunately, I can only rate this movie with 1-star, if I could give it a lower rating, I would. The dancing was pathetic, the acting was weak.... I could not connect with any of the characters it was just blah! I loved seeing Stephen Boss - Twitch (so you think you can dance) and Columbus Short, however it was not enough to make this movie good! Without a doubt the first movie was so much better. In the first movie the acting, dancing and story-line was really good. I like to support black movies and I am not sure who the writer, director and producer was on this movie. But clearly they need to go back to the drawing board. Huge flop!"
1,Bad Product - Error Made by Activision,"Activision and SEGA, who created the Gold Edition made a major error with this product. When downloading the 2.01 patch to play Multiplayer, the game does not recognize the Gold Edition as a Medieval Total War or Viking Invasion game (since this is a 3-CD set) and will not install. An unofficial patch has been created, but you will never be able to play Multiplayer with this ""Gold Edition"". I mailed SEGA/Activision with a complaint about this failed product and their failure to fix the error, and I was supplied with another copy, which was the Medieval Total War: Battle Collection"" copy. I do not advise purchasing this error-ridden product."
5,If you love Medieval warfare this is it!,"I purchased this game after reading about it on[...] The graphics are dated obviously, but this about the game. You can marry your daughters off or have a foreign county ally with you through marriage of their daughters to your sons. Make war on your neighbors! You have religions Catholic, Orthodox, and Islam that make diplomacy and alliances difficult, just like back then. You have assassins that can do your dirty work but at a price to the king.Really simple, if you enjoy turn based stragety or RTS you will enjoy the chance to rule the known world!"
1,problem,wat is with the game i install it and gets all workking and everything but then when it is loading it quits and tells me there was a visual error. please help
4,Best risers available,"This set came with 10 pieces, which is enough to make 2 tall and 2 short risers (or 4 short if you prefer). They are good quality and about 50% wood; the base part of each riser is plastic. The track still gets messed up all the time but that's because my kids are rough on it. I really do think that these support a rising track better then any other I have used.I would rate these five stars for quality, but am giving it 4 because too be honest, my kids rarely use them. My husband enjoys having them because they are a critical part of any complex layout, but my children (ages 4, 2 and 1) don't use them at all unless they are already set up for them. I've seen my oldest one fix a toppled track so I know he gets how to assemble them but he just isn't interested. Still a good purchase though, for the sake of my husband."
3,Excelent product but...,"I just bought my viewsonic VA720 today. At home I plugged it in, it is very good looking and has a very sharp picture. At first the image was a little shaky and I couldn't understand why. Then I discovered the auto-adjust feature, which is very useful. I ran it and the weird lines disappeared. The only problem with the monitor is that it has a dead pixel. When the monitor shows a black screen the pixel shows up magenta. It really is an eye sore. I am going to take it back to the store tomorrow see if I can get it replaced. Everything is super, just for that lonesome pixel. If it weren't for that defect I would have given it a perfect 5."
4,A work in progress,I've been playing piano for only a couple months. I was looking for a book to provide me with a challenge yet is readable. I think this book satisfies my desire. The pieces are quite simplified but I still find them challenging. A good book to have around.
1,"My first Book of Classical Music: 29 themes by Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin and other Great composers in Easy Piano Arrangements",I would have preferred a sample page of the music to preview prior to purchase. The pieces are too simple for me.
3,Doesn't work with newer iPhones (4S),The cable hooks up easily and works great when switched to AUX for my older iPod video but when I plugged in my new iPhone 4S it gave me a message stating that charging wasn't supported on this connection which basically rendered the whole thing useless for my iPhone.All in all I still get the funcionality of using my iPod so I can't complain.
2,nope,This pillow did not help me to sleep at all on my flight to Europe and the worst part was the cumbersome way I had to cram it in my carryon. Bottom line is it is too heavy to lug around and too firm. Takes up too much space in luggage.
1,Not received GPS's,"On September 14th I bought 6 Tom Tom GO 720 navigations, but still I didn't receive them, October 30. I wrote letters and sellers could not answer when I will receive. Concerning this situation I can say that this seller is not professional and not trustable. Think one more time before buying any items from this seller."
5,Tom Tom go 720 4.3 inches bluetooth,"I love my new Tom Tom go 720 bluetooth. Very easy to understand and operate. However, I'm still trying to understand how to download the music. Everything else is up and running great!"
2,GO720 doesn't work.,"My GO730 was fine out of the box. I installed the software on the PC and the TomTom according to the directions. From then on, the TomTom will not come up. When I try to turn it on, it brings up an error message that the map has an error and it will not continue. I am unable to use it on the trip I am currently on. I will work on it but I may have to return it.Harley Burton"
2,"Good, until the software failed.","I have owned the Tom Tom 720 (it was a gift) for over a year. During that time, it functioned well. However, a few days ago, the Maps, other than Guam, disappeared. I am not a novice with these products. I was sure that the U.S. maps had somehow been deleted. I contacted Tom Tom and was given instructions on how to recover the maps or reset the unit. I followed the advice precisely. No luck. Tom Tom concluded that the maps were, indeed, lost. They said the only way to restore them was to purchase/download for $69.95. I must admit, this did not cheer me up. Not planning to drive in Guam anytime soon, I tossed the Tom Tom in the garbage. I will purchase another GPS; you can guess what brand it will not be.The only way to deal with companies like this is to not patronize them. I encourage you to look elsewhere."
5,720 is a GO,"I love the Tele Atlas Maps that the 720 uses--The POI coverage is impressive, and i just read that they have over 24 million of them. I didn't even know there were 24 million points of interest, period. TT makes it really easy to entering addresses according to state,and the screen is large and able to be fully customized. I also love the fact that it provides the text-to-speech option."
3,"NIce Little Gadget, but rsearch first","I really do like all the features that this gizmo has to offer, but i wish i would have done a bit more research. I have a top of the line ATT LG Encite phone... and guess what... yep many features are just not compatible. One major example is ""Text To Talk"". It also seems to link only when it really feels like it. Another issue is the built in mp3 player. Once again it only seems to play when it wants. I get a lot of audio error messages. Still a simple reset fixes all that. The biggest issue that I have is the fact that the battery really only lasts about 2 hours. Its to the point I just leave it plugged in. As for directions, clarity, and reliability for a GPS unit.. its right on. Nice easy touch screen (Can get a remote) with a big display and very clear picture."
2,Doesn't hold a light to a Garmin!,"HORRIBLE if you are looking for help to find places, unlike the Garmin there are no searches where you canjust look for food by category and what not. I returned it and got the Garmin instead!!!"
2,Good unit - DO NOT DOWNLOAD UPDATE!,"Had one of these for over a year, recently ""updated"" and after the update the screen calibration was off center. Tomtom service is the pits! They said there was nothing they could do.Bought a replacement, worked fine for a few weeks, then after connecting to Tomtom Home, it recommended the update. After this, the speech was ""stuttering"" and would flip back to the menu right in the middle of manuevers.Amazon were excellent, refunded promptly , and as I still liked the unit, re-ordered. This new one is working fine, and I will not update the software until I read that Tomtom have fixed the problems.So, in summary - Amazon 5 stars, Tomtom 1 star, the unit itself 3 stars."
2,failed after 2 days,"My husband bought this to use on trips when we had rental cars. It just stopped working after 2 days. We are returning it to Tom Tom for an exchange. While it was working, it was good. Will return to this review when I get the replacement."
1,HUGE FLAW!,"there is one HUGE problem.... When putting in the navigation info, you had best know the city... I often know a street address in the suburb of a major city but not the town name.. gee whiz, the people that live in those suburbs themselves don't know the obscure town name.... but the 720 won't let you get past the city query to put in the street address until you say what the city it... well... I know it is baltimore...but who knows if it is owings mills, glyndon, lutherville or cockysville.this is a HORRIBLE design problem.. I will have to send my unit back. too bad..I like everything else about it....."
4,Nice GPS,"I did not try the other GPS. All experience I have is only TomTom. However, this unit helps me a lot when I go to some new places. Regardless of that I cannot compare its route with other GPS, it never fails me. This GPS never directed me in and out for the same highway repeatly for the trips I experienced. The re-route is very fast when the exit is passed.For the route it suggests around my area, it may not be the best route for me. It works just like someone who is not very familiar with my neighbourhood.Overall, it is a good companion for travel. I am quite satisfied with this device."
1,OLD UNIT OR REFURBISHED,"When I ordered the Tom Tom 720 the ad stated it was a new unit. I fully charged the unit after receipt and took it to try the next day, the battery lasted 45 minutes. Called Tom Tom customer service and told them of the problem and the service rep said I probably bought a refurbished unit under the guize of a new one. Also said Amazon has been known to do this. Well, I sent the ""new unit"" back, and was sent a refubished unit in it's place. It works fine.......The long and the short of it is I got a refurbished unit for the price of a new one. BUYER BEWARE! I will never order from AMAZON again.TomTom GO 720 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator"
5,Great Product,"This is the first GPS unit i have so i dont consider my self an expert but i have to say that this product everything i needed help with, i like all the features, its very accurate specially on the speed limits, as soon as you entere a speed limit change it displays it right away, its very quick calculating route changes.After i purchased this unit two of my friends have Garmin GPS's and it seems that the Tom Tom ones aquire satellite signal much faster, i belive this should be a common feature regardless of the model.In general i am very happy with it."
2,"Too many myths, not enough Confucianism","Some A & E Biographies are hits, and some are misses. Regrettably, this is one of the latter. On the positive side, there are good visuals, and some useful comments by three experts in this biography of Master K'ung (known in the West as Confucius). However, the narration often states what are well-known myths about Confucius as if they were historical facts. And the video does not discuss Confucianism nearly as much as it should. In sum, this video is not a good introduction to Confucius and Confucianism."
2,Wrong One,There was no indication as to which volume the answer book was and it turned out to be the wrong volume. Not a fault of the product. Just clarify next time.
5,A terrific book for reference on natural approaches for healing different conditions,I think this book is excellent!It goes into in-depth details to explain how different therapies work for different health problems. Different conditions are also listed from A-Z & with explanations of them. Different alternative treatments are listed & which type of natural medicine or natural doctors/therapies to go with.
1,"Source Naturals Life Force Multiple, No Iron, 180 Tablets","I really like the Source Naturals Life Force Multiple, No Iron 180 Capsules. The Tablets taste and smell terrible and I am not able to take them. I wish you would stock the capsules and not the tablets."
5,Love it.,I collect Christmas CD's and love opera. To me this one is the best. Ms Price's voice is clear and beautiful. Listined to this CD more than the other opera Christmas CD's I purchased.
1,Waste of money,"I was anxiously awaiting this product, however it ran the first and only time I wore them. Normally Spanx products are strong, this product product is flimsy. No fault to the vendor."
2,Snagged after second wearing,"These snagged the second time I wore them, and it wasn't a little snag. I just went to pull them up and a huge snag appeared. They are very thin to begin with and they don't provide much support in the leg area. They do relieve a little of the strain on your back, but other than that I would not recommend these to someone who is looking to prevent vericose veins or strain on their legs during pregnancy. If you are a regular pantyhose wearer and are just looking for maternity pantyhose these may work."
4,A very well build strainer,"This is a great strainer, it feel very well built, very solid, and is very comfortable to use. It has a nice lip on the opposite side of the handle to rest it on the side of a bowl or pot. The mesh is very fine, something the size of a grain or rice won't get through, but maybe something like chia seeds could sneak past. I wish it were a tiny bit finer, but it works perfect for most everything. It is a bit smaller then I had expected. Just to give you an idea, it is about the size of a large orange."
3,Works as advertised,"It's a strainer and it strains. However, the hook on the opposite side of the handle fell right off after a few days of owning it. I suppose making an average utensil then putting CIA in front of the name convinces everyone that it is great quality as evidenced by all the 5 star ratings. It is cheap for a reason."
1,Bad luck or bad product,"These batteries were inexpensive and industrial strength, but after using the last 4 batteries and thinking the other batteries dying was a fluke it is apparent that these are either old or just very bad product. I rarely if ever have any problems with any product purchased through Amazon but this one was not good. The batteries used before I replaced them lasted a year. I couldn't get more than a few weeks out of any of these."
1,But it had all these awards...,"Oops. I saw the ad and gave in to all the awards I saw, later seeing it at Dole theatre. As a local indie filmmaker and supporter, I don't understand how a film can be ""shot"" so badly, and with $2,ooo, that's a lot of money to work with (try it w/$1oo). A friend of mine bought it for $2o. She later would weep and say, ""I've been screwed. And my thighs are weeping."" But she kept it, seeing how she's a movie hound. (Although she did return a copy she got for Christmas.)Aloha!"
5,The Sci-fi Bible,"The Sci-fi Bible, December 24, 2005Reviewer: Suzeej Omnipo ""Suzeej"" (NYC) - See all my reviewsMy friends and I call Lilith's Brood ""The Sci-fi Bible"". The trilogy of Dawn, Adulthood Rites, & Imago are probably the most important pieces of Sci-fi literature to come out of the 20th Century. If you like the genre and particularly books with a high fantasy (less ""scientific"") component then you should definitely read Lilith's Brood. Butler is an amazing author. It is refreshing to see sci-fi written so masterfully. Reading this book was a philosophically life altering experience for me. Everyone I know will receive a copy this year."
3,Okay,The first book and last book were the best. The second book was so slow and redundant that I almost didn't read the third. The third book was okay but oh my the places this author could have taken this story! BIG let down for me.
3,"Good, but...","I felt that there was no REAL character development where the charcters just seemed dry and rigid. Half the time Lilith, the main character, annoyed me more than anything else. Other than that, it is pretty typical as far as scifi novels go. It didn't *wow* me at all, and after I finished reading it I didn't really take anything meaningful away from it.To each their own, you may or may not like it. But I do not feel that it is anywhere close to a ""great read""."
4,Kids Car Tray,"I read the reviews about this product prior to purchasing it and although the common thread about it being too soft was evident, I bought two anyway. I'm not disappointed with the trays so far. My oldest son is 3, and he used the tray on a 3 hour drive. He had a blast crashing his cars on the table top and I'm glad I had an area to place his snacks so that fries and nuggets weren't smashed between the car seat cushions. My youngest son is 1 1/2 and he had an issue with the tray sitting on his legs the very first time he used it, on a 20 minute ride home from day-care. After that first time he was ok with it. I definitely recomend it from a practical stand point but as a mom I know some kids just won't like using it, personal preferences and all. I gave it a four because although it has the lips, on occasion things do roll off somehow...maybe its my kids, and because the pockets are in weird places so the kids can't reach some of the things in them espcially small things like crayons."
4,good,"a bit slippery, at least the corners are holding things so they don't fallotherwise good quality but not really stable"
2,It's o.k.,"I bought this for my son so he can have things at his fingertips during car rides such as toys, sip cup, crackers, etc. Its very flimsy and loves to bend so things slide down and into his seat where he can't reach them so it defeats the purpose all together. Also, he hates it! He doesn't like it at all and starts screaming now if I try to put it over his legs. So needless to say we don't even use it anymore. If its just to keep his toys and sip cup next to him...if he will let me put the table over his legs...then its fine but not stable enough for snacks or any kind of book activity on."
2,Too Flimsy to be practical!,"I ordered this tray to use during our seven day drive back east and I recieved the tray today, excited to finally have it, we tore the package open and got the tray out... only to be dissapointed. The tray folds for convienience, however there will be no coloring on our trip because the tray is too soft, we're stuck with it now dissapointed or not... If I had to do it again I would definatley order a plastic tray for our trip."
3,rethink how manufacturer packages please,amazon packaging we perfect however the item itself gets shoved in a tiny carry case that makes the product malformed and misshapened and it's very hard to get it to sit right...needed this tray for a 5K mile trip to Arizona and back and wasn't very pleased
4,Snack and Play Travel Tray,"It seems like a great product, unfortunately, on our 20 hour drive neither of my kids wanted to use it. Not too happy I spent 40 dollars on something they won't use. So, my review is, looks great, but can't comment on how it works."
4,Great for a plane trip,"We bought this for my two-year-old prior to our cross country flight for Thanksgiving. We had first taken his car seat on the plane this summer and were dismayed to find he could not use the seat back tray. I was very pleased with the design of this tray. It was compact enough to fit in our carry on bag with toys and books. I found it to be easy to install on his seat during the flight and easy to remove when we didn't need it. It was wide enough for his coloring books and the lip was great for catching his little cars. He liked running them into the walls! The only downside is a lack of cup holder, but we found it easy enough to keep his drink on my tray. The side pockets were useful for holding our mp3 player and markers in flight. I look forward to trying it on our next big car trip."
3,Works fine,"I said ""it's ok"" simply because it was rarely used. It needs a back lip to avoid things going in to my daughter's lap. I expected it to be flimsy for safety, but you should know it is as described by other customers."
5,Travel Tray,Perfect for single parents or parents traveling alone for long periods of time. My son uses the tray to color or to eat on the go. Would recomend for any on the go parent.
4,Snack Tray,"I bought this before a long car ride vacation so my 2 year old could play with her toys and color while riding. After trying one that was supposed to clip down on to her car seat (and was extremely unstable), I ordered this one that snaps around the seat. Fantastic product!! Only downside was that it was a very hot week-end traveling and her legs got sweaty under the tray. It's just the right size that she can easily reach the crayons that roll to the edges but nothing rolls out!"
4,solid snack tray,"This tray worked well. It's a bit of a pain to wrap the straps around every time they get in though. It also got hot on my kids legs. I like that it is soft, safe and keeps things on the tray."
3,Snack tray,"I thought it would have a more stable surface, but it doesn't. My grandson doesn't like it as much as I thought he would. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
2,Wasn't overly impressed,"I purchased two of these trays two weeks ago because we were heading on a 23 hour car journey with my 4 year old and 18 month old. Although this is probably more useful than having nothing at all, I wasn't impressed with this product. I know that the manufacturer was probably after safety by making it out of foam however it reduces the ease of use. My 4 year old was not impressed as it was very difficult to color or draw on since it does not have a hard surface. It also didn't fit very well on either of my car seats. At the same time, I purchased another tray from a different company and found it much easier to use. It is made of hard plastic instead which made it better for play, eating, and crafts. It was also safety tested so I am assuming it is just as safe as this product."
3,"Cool idea, but did not work for us","The idea is to have a tray that attaches to the car seat. It didn't really work for our 15 month old. Maybe it was because she is too young. But, having to carry another item while going through airports is a pain. It is small and folds up, but it is bulky and takes up space in your bag/backpack."
3,nice if your stroller has a tray already,"This is a great item for a car seat, but won't work on an umbrella stroller or any stroller without a pre-existing tray. It is made out of foam and does not stand up on it's own."
3,flimsy,not really useful for snacking or much of anything-we bought it for a road trip and its just a waste-we now use it to lie flat on the ground at the beach for coloring or whatever.
4,Works well!!!!,"This has really helped with all the toy dropping. I'm not saying my 19 month old still doesn't throw her toys in floor board, but this does help. I can also put snacks on it. Cleans very easy. Nice that it's a tray that is still safe just in case of a car accident (God forbid). I would definitely purchase this again!"
1,Snack and play travel tray,"Product was not as expected, didn't fix with my car seat and at the end my child didn't like it or used at all"
5,Awesome,We just took a trip to Utah and these were amazing I was hesitant to but at first because they looked confusing and seemed to good to be true but they really are. They can color play with toys eating that was the best part instead of stopping to eat they ate in the car and we had less of a mess. This is one of the best purchases I have made in a really long time along with my DVD's for the car. Truly awesome especially if you travel alot these will grow with the kids for as long as they are in car seats. If you live in CA that is forever with all the stupid laws
5,Loved It!,"The tabletop is flimsy, but who wants something to protrude into your kids belly if you get into a crash?! I used this so that my daughter (3 yrs old) had a place for her toys during our 10 day road trip. She is into the little animals made of plastic and likes to walk them around. I put her snack on the tray as well, and she was able to color on this too. I liked it. I haven't used it since the trip, because there is just no point in setting it up for a 10 minute trip to the store, but for long road trips it was great!"
3,Very uncomfortable on the lap,"I should have listened to some reviews. It doesn't fit well over my 2 yo's lap. First problem, it doesn't sit flat as a table and so his snacks would fall to one side. Then it is not comfortable resting on his lap. I usually get great buys from amazon. But, this is one product where I wasted my money. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not for me...,"It was just okay, my daughter, 2, did not like it straped around her and it was too flimsey and when I used it in the car and let her eat on it the food just got all over her because of the big gap between her and the tray and if I pulled it tighter it would crunch up and then be even worse. So I wouldn't recomend this to people with young kids maybe it would be better if she was 4 or 5 but I can't say for deffinate. I was just real disapointed I had heard alot of good reviews and then it didn't meet any of my expectations. The only good part is the side pockets, they are nice for storage, but we no longer use this since she hates it and trys to take it off. I hope this has been some help to others so they don't make the same mistake I did. It is real flimsy which would be good if you were in an accident I guess, but that is it. Sorry....."
3,Decent good travel tray,This is a decent travel tray. I was hoping the flat part would be a little more sturdy and firm than it is. It also didn't fit well over my son's Sunshine Kids car seat. I think it would work better on a wider car seat.
4,Can't travel without it,"A long car trip must. My only complaint is the side mesh pockets are hard for little hands to get oddly-shaped toys in and out of (things get hung up easily). The surface is a bit on the soggy side, but I understand why the manufacturer has to do that. But, it's rigid enough for a coloring book, just not loose sheets. Just the fact that it keeps everything from hitting the floor makes it worthwhile..."
3,Ivan the Terrible,"Overall, this video was a interesting overview of the life of one of Russia's most fascinating Tsars. However, I was a little dissapointed at the lack of indepth coverage."
2,a disappointment,"I was so disappointed in, and frustrated by, this book, that I felt compelled to hop online at 9pm to write a review. The characters are one-dimensional, the profuse pop culture references are annoying, and the repetitive verbiage seems like Jane Green was cranking this out just to fulfill a contract. Some of my 7th grade students could produce more imaginitive writing. I have really enjoyed Green's other novels, and found Jemima J specifically engaging and inspiring (I read it in one sitting). This insipid novel falls short. If you are desperate for a beach read, it will do, as long as you borrowed rather than bought it."
2,One very crucial flaw,I'm a big fan of Jane Green's work but she really missed the mark with this one. Both of the main characters could have died at any point in the story and I wouldn't have cared less.There was absolutely nothing to like about either of them. Both of them were selfish and self absorbed and both of them did nothing but whine about their perfectly good lives.Like many successful authors I get the feeling that Jane Green now just throws a few words on paper and counts on the fact that her name on the cover will generate sales. That might work for awhile but eventually readers such as myself will catch on and move on to an author with something to say.
3,Yeah...but....,"this was actually one of the more boring of Jane Green's novels. I skipped over a lot of pages, felt the story didn't spark or fit together very well and the characters and writing wasn't very fluid, it seemed kind of stick in places. Mediocre at best, Jane."
4,Swapping Lives,If you love Jane Green you will be happy with this book written in the same style as others. Her characters in this book tend to very naive. Sometimes when ready it they drag on and on-all I could think was get over it already.
2,Not that great,"I recently took some books home with me for the holidays to catch up on some reading. Friends of mine are big fans of this author so I decided to check out this book and was disappointed. I found the characters to be rather superficial and one dimensional and the story did not really hold up after about the first fifty pages. In short, there really wasn't much depth to really keep you interested in what was going on, though I would not say that it was boring. Just not very substantial.I would not recommend this book unless you are looking to read something very, very light."
3,"Didn't ""inspire me""","I think this book was a good read. Wasn't a page-turner for me but I was able to get through it. This is one of those ""greener on the other side of the fence stories."" Someone is not happy with what they have and wants to find out if what they wish for could be worth the wait. The two women who switched lives, Vicky (35 & a Poise Magazine editor) and Amber (housewife, mother of 2) didn't stick it out for the whole month. I don't think this was a true telling on how the other half lives. I've read in other reviews that Jane Green's earlier books were better. I will let you know."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this newest read from Ms. Green - Being a stay at home mother of several young children myself, it was very easy to picture myself the subject of a ""swapping lives"" type of situation - It was easy to read, the characters were engaging, and I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for some enjoyable reading."
3,Nice but disappointing,The stitches are well explained and very nice. I was disappointed when I received the book and discovered the only color pictures were on the cover. I would have enjoyed it much more with a few examples of the finished work in color.
1,What historian could put his/her name to this?,"I have bought several tapes from this outfit on Rome, but unhappily at the same time, otherwise I would have saved my money. I've been reading about this period for over 20 years and have over a thousand books in my library by the best historians. These videos are very poor and not researched well. I am just disappointed that stuff like this could be put out as history by a supposedly respected organization."
4,My little waitress,My granddaughter looks adorable in this outfit and it is made very well. What is most charming is that she really gets into character and demonstrates how aware she is when she eats out. This is such a great age for encouraging imaginative play and my four-year-old has so much fun pretending while learning to appreciate the challenges of being a service professional! Very fun.
2,Caution!,"Caution! I bought these batteries for my battery-run small camping fan. Unlike batteries used in flashlights, in this usage the batteries need to deliver a sizable pulse of high current at the start to get the fan motor turning from its stopped position. These don't do it! I've found that syndrome with no-name batteries, but I never expected it to happen with one of the oldest battery name products. Meanwhile some ""Varta"" batteries (made in Germany) that I bought at Parts Express did the job with NO problem. Likewise some Duracells I used a while ago.I was very disappointed."
5,Little package,You have heard that good things come in little packages..This little knife has it all....looks and features. Fits right in a ladies pocket.
1,Swiss Army - Made in China?,"This is my 3rd Swiss Army knife that broke in few months. I had swiss ARmy knives in the past that spelt quality with a capital ""Q"". Eventually companies will get the message when they try to save a buck by sacrificing quality producing them in else where. You get what you pay for and what you are paying for these knives seems to be 10 times more than what it's worth. The name is ""Swiss Army"" but would like to see ""Swiss Made"" somewhere in the package or the knife itself. Good luck finding that and please stay away from these unless Amazon specifies the true country of Origin. 3 knives should tell you that I've learnt my lesson. There goes another faithful customer of Swiss Army products."
5,Cute and Functional,"I got this for my 12 year old daughter and she loved it. All of her friends have asked for one! It would be a great stocking stuffer. Very handy. I don't think she's actually used it out of need, but if she does need it, it's there!"
4,Wonderfully Twisted!,This series is insanely twisted! I wish it had lasted more than one season! Seth Green and Eugene Levy are brilliant!
2,A paradoxical book.,"Mahmoud Mohamed Taha is one of the most original and daring of modern Islamic thinkers. This book of his, undeservedly ignored in the so-called liberated West, is a proclamation of reform and tolerance, against the oppression and despotisms that currently enmesh the Muslim world. He was a man who refused to recant, regardless of the hostility of public opinion during the dictatorial regime of Ja'ffar Nimerei, and chose instead to suffer the martyrdom of the hangman's rope. Nowadays, his followers dare not declare themselves, nor breathe a word of his teachings publicly, for fear of being persecuted and stigmatised. Admittedly, his doctrine may seem unrealistic today, in the world of multinational companies and mass consumerism. Much of it is riddled by logical contradictions. For example, it is nonsensical to talk of reforming Islam, a religion which is doctrinally irreformable. But, even if one doesn't agree with him, one is still moved to admire his courage..."
2,"Great design, poor workmanship.","The first shipment had a huge blemish in the top ..looked like a nail had been driven in, with some sort of attempt at plugging the hole, and sanding marks in the finish around the problem. This was rejected. The second shipment had a blemish on the side, and glue and white putty in clear evidence around the top. I have rejected both, and am still waiting for a piece of furniture that is acceptable. A clear case of shoddy quality control on what could have been a well designed product,"
3,good but not the best,"if you like lambdin's style, this book is pretty good, though gets away from the actual naval battles. i also suggest the Thomas Kydd adventures by Julian Stockwell"
3,Hard to read,"Lambdin has good ideas and plotting but he writes in such turgid prose, I had trouble getting through the novel.I wish Mr. Lambdin would can the dialect. I'm sure he is transcribing an accurate version of an Irish brogue or a pirates patois, but have some pity on the poor reader.Dialect is good in a film or play perhaps, but not in an adventure novel. After going through this latest Alan Lewrie adventure, I have a new appreciation for Patrick O'Brian's elegant prose.I have read the previous eleven installments of the Alan Lewrie saga.The time has come to bring the series to a close or discipline the writing."
5,Still working nicely,"I am tired of writing what other knows already, so I am just going to cut and paste this version of exciting comment and review to everyone to read and gets the same boring imagination. Yea! Goog! wove it"
5,works perfect,"I learned my lesson there is no substitute for ACDelco parts, cheap aftermarkets part are not the way to go. these last longer work better"
5,Still on top of their game...,"Great show. Amazing musicians, excelent sound and image. The energy is contagious and even the Montreux audience, although somewhat shy, can't avoid getting involved. Rodgers is still on top of his game. His guitar was and still is the soul of Chic. The other members of the band are equally exceptional. Well done!!!"
4,Can't Go Wrong With Thomas,"Thomas the Train has provided hours of entertainment in my home. My son loves to build tracks, I think more than he likes driving one of his many trains on the track. I would highly recommend it to anyone searching for a durable, educational toy for their child."
2,Cannot pass exam with this!!,"I sat the exam today with this as my primary source and some backup from ExamCram. I failed (644 with 790 to pass, 71 questions).To date: I have taken 5 Cisco exams and passed the other 4.The previous reviewers remarks were right on regarding PPPoE and dialer-watch. I was guessing on any of the questions regarding these two as they are not covered in the book. I walked into this exam very confident as that's the way this book makes you feel. Again, as the other reviewer pointed out, this book lulls you into a false sense of knowledge. I actually ran out of time. I still had 5 or 6 questions to go when the timer expired.I am very disappointed with this book but after reading reviews on other sources, it seems as though there is no one source that a candidate can use to pass this exam."
4,A good book to study for the BCRAN Exam,"The book is very informative and definitely worth reading page to page for not only does it give information relevant to the BCRAN exam but also other valuable information which will help the Cisco Professional gain more knowledge in relevant products and technologies and be better in their work. This is a must-have book, part of the Cisco Professional's collector items."
3,More details needed,"The BCRAN exam guide serves exactly that purpose: a guide, and a rather patchy one at that.While all the exam outlines are covered in this book, sadly not enough details are included, and the BCRAN exam requires greater understanding of the topics than what is presented in this book.I used this book as the only resource and was taken aback by the depth of the exam questions. Luckily my hands-on and general networking knowledge pulled me through.If you have enough hands-on experience, then perhaps this book alone will be sufficient for passing BCRAN. However, if you lack hands-on, then this book can only serve as a ""fundamentals guide"", and you need another BCRAN book to cover the gaps."
1,Another Greedy Executive,"This book was horrible. Wade was promoted to CEO of American Skandia, in his role he made sure to oust the previous CEO from any say in what happens with the company. This Ex-CEO was responsible for brining American Skandia to the top. After Wade drove American Skandia to the ground he was quoted saying in a management meeting ""When this company is sold I'm going to get rich"". Is this someone that you have confidence in directing you where to put your money. Let's remember that he lost so much credibility with his clients that he almost ran the company completly to the ground. Now Prudential has saved American Skandia from complete destruction."
1,Very disappointed!!! ;(,"I'm very disappointed because I NEVER got my movie that I bought like 5 months ago, so what is up with that? Paid for it, but....oh well!!!"
5,This diet really works,"This is the best diet plan available today! I started the diet on June 24, 2002 and have lost 40lbs. And when combined with exercise results like mine can be obtained by anyone who is motivated to lose weight. I don't feel hungry and I can still enjoy some of the foods other diets do not allow. Its worth the investment for anyone who is truly motivated to take control of their weight."
2,Too hard to follow,"I was not really impressed with this book. While it is based on sound nutritional and psychological principles, I found it hard to follow. I can find similar information without spending the money on this book. I will probably sell it at my next garage sale."
1,90/10 Weight loss plan,"was very disappointed by this, the part of the book that is needed to start and do this diet was not in the book, completely torn out...not there, not available...not happy!!! Pages 109-138 and pages 203-234 gone out of book. So don`t know about the balance of healthy foods and fun foods...not in there...the 1200 calorie plan...nope not in there either."
4,Good diet book,"The 90/10 Weight-Loss Plan: A Scientifically Designed Balance of Healthy Foods and Fun FoodsThe book is a lot of common sense, with a daily dose of a treat to not make you feel like you're on a diet. If you already know sensible eating patterns then you don't need this. If you need a reminder everyone once and while on what we are supposed to eat, and not what we think we can eat, then your health is probably worth the money you'll spend on this book"
4,Please show type and number of bricks for Lego sets,"Some of the unhappiness expressed in earlier reviews could have been avoided if the listing had shown the types of bricks and the count for each. Lego sets are a bit expensive, but they do hold up well."
4,Great for building and storage.,Once it was opened my 5 year old took out the instructions and started making things. He keeps going back to it and building on his own.
1,mom,Where are the lego????The nice bin came but 400 pieces only fill up the bin 1/4 full. My children asked where are the rest of the pieces? I am questioning lego strategy with marketing. I see lego as a creative tool I shopped for ever and finially went on line to find a box of plain lego from which my children can decide what to create. Buying online from Canada ment roughly $55 in shipping and duty for a 1/4 full box. Not happy.
2,a lot of pieces are missed.,"There are only about 200 pieces, not as you said 405 piece, please send a lot of missed piece to me, thanks."
3,"Not enough of the ""right"" pieces.","The boys love Lego's. However, they seem to prefer the sets. Also, this set did not have enough of the ""right"" pieces so they could make what they wanted to build. This set needs a better mix of sizes. ( Lego pieces)"
5,405 Pieces in Lego Land in Really nothing - The Bucket is only a Quarter Fill,"Don't be fooled by the bucket size, 405 pieces is really nothing when it comes to build a Lego piece. When I opened the box at first, I though its missing pieces, I actually counted it.The bucket is actually very useful to store my additional Lego sets."
3,works well for a first set,"The box is only about 1/4 filled with legos. Really for the creative builder, you would need about three of these sets to build much of anything. My son received these on Christmas, and we haven't played with it very much. It just seems like the legos don't stay together very well, and every time we build something decent, it falls apart so easily, it is hardly worth the effort. Possibly legos have always been this way. I was more interested in dolls as a girl, so this is really my first lego experience. For now they are put up in his closet. Im hoping since he is a boy, he will ""get it"" more than I seem to, and one day be able to build wonders with his legos. Meanwhile he seems to favor his duplo blocks, lincoln logs, and regular wooden blocks."
3,"405 sounds like a lot, but isn't","Legos are great, don't get me wrong... but it's a little disappointing when you are expecting 405 pieces to be a lot of legos (it's not). You will need to buy two or three of these to really go to town building. A little underwhelming."
4,Great Purchase,I bought this item for my 10yo son and both he and my 11yo daughter have been building like crazy. They're constantly showing me new things they constructed and hurry through their homework to get back to them. Sweet!
3,Box too large,"This Lego box was a good size but the number of pieces that came with it were misproportioned to the container. That is to say, not very many pieces in one big box. Feel a little misled."
2,Whining losers,"Starts off great, then they have this whiny song about ""What's wrong with being weak"" that ruins the whole album. I am ashamed to own this album."
3,Almost an Album,"""Cedars"" qualifies as a semi-middle of the road peice of work. At some points it sounds great, and then at others it splashes everywhere like Thanksgiving gravey. It is worth a listin if nothing else for the song ""I'd Really Like to Hurt You"". It's a teetering on the fence record that just can't pull itself any higher, allbeit this album does have it's high points.So i am giving it a slight recommendation, if nothing esle but for the satisfaction of the aforementioned song."
5,Christmas Music with Smooth R&B Style,"This CD is my absolute favorite this year. David Gough has a smooth singing style and each song on the CD is worth listening to over and over but if I had to pick a favorite it would be the album title - ""This Christmas"". I'd like to buy more music by this performer - I really like his style."
2,Vista ignorant,"Obviously, you will have issues with MS Vista with this drive.Often, the drive will just disappear. I cannot tell you how many times it fails the automated backups in Vista.Pass on this drive for Vista.I gave it 2 stars only because of the manual copy capacity."
1,Cambridge Is Not a Good Place to Live,"If you've never been there or only been there for a few hours, I should warn you that Cambridge and the entire Boston area are rotten. If you go to Harvard (an overrated school) then you will have to live in a city full of blue-haired goons, aging fruity ""intellectuals,"" and very old people. You will also be in the most pretentious city on the planet and across the river from the second most. Save yourself some money and your soul and go to SUNY Binghamton."
1,notice all the good reviews are clumped up in periods of 3 days or less,"obviously there are people out there trying to boost the ratings of this book.just looking at essays will do you no good, because comparing your work with others is extremely hard to be unbias. useless. if you really need a book like this, get it from the library, so once you're done you dont have to reread it."
1,More nonsense from the Harvard Crimson,"Contrary to popular opinion, the Harvard Crimson writers really do not know any more about writing a good essay than most intelligent students. The essays mostly follow standard formulae - combining them will certainly not produce a successful essay."
5,"One you try a mac, you will never go back!","I just purchased the MacBook Pro from Amazon and I am COMPLETELY satisfied!There is no better computer or a better place to buy it.This computer has everything I need...and more! It looks great and works like a gem. If you are a graphics person, there is no better computer."
5,Happy!,Love this movie! It's fun to see the begining of the story since I have never read the books!I would say it is a keeper for sure!
5,Days Of Our Lives,"This CD is AWESOME!! I heard the song on the radio and rushed here to see if I could buy it! It has such a great message and makes me think about what's really important when I'm rushing around town like crazy! Plus, this guy's voice in unbelievable!!! I even like the other song on the disc called The Ball--my son loves it, too!! Can't wait too hear the whole album. I'm already a big fan!!"
5,Awsome song...,"When i First heard this song,i thought it was Phil Vasser and so i thought ""Hey he wrote the song for the show""(he appeared on the show during Fan Fair week this year)and i started listening to it it sounded so like my Fav Soap Opera ""Days of our lives""..well i come to find out it was by James otto...and it was so cool!i just finally bought the cd and listed to James explain the song..and i was right that he partly named it because the soap opera!i'm very exicted!Great i love this guys singing!"
3,"Vivid description, vivid emotion","For those who love poetry, the art of words, and deep meaning, this book offers hours of pleasure. Through vivid physical and emotional imagery, John Montague poignantly conveys life. His verses, which span a writing career of almost forty years, include themes such as the realities of a divided Ireland, love, childhood, and living in other parts of the world. For those without a basic knowledge of the politics, history, and vocabulary of Northern Ireland it will be difficult to understand some of the poems, but it is a moving reading experience nonetheless. Your imagination will be captured by this poet's incredible reality."
1,"Snippet collections, nothing more.","This ""edition"" is the equivalent of a K-tel record collection greatest radio hits: a SELECTION of bits and pieces (""radio-edit"" versions) rearranged topically into a collection that never existed before, and for good reason.To begin with, a topical organization is entirely antithetical to Nietzsche's thinking: Nietzsche, perhaps more than any other western philosopher was a thinker of contexts, of nuances, and contradictions. To take fragments out of context is almost necessarily to misunderstand him (and these topics are entirely the editor's invention, NOT Nitezsche's, and not even coming necessarily from the interests Nietzsche shows in his work). (...)If I haven't made myself clear yet, DO NOT READ THIS SCRAPBOOK of Nietzsche's aphorisms, ESPECIALLY AS AN INTRODUCTION to Nietzsche's philosophy."
5,A book to worth buying,This is a great book. Well written and one that you would love to read over and over again. I would love to buy it for each of my friends. I love it.
5,Reliable DVD's,This is my first use of the Phillips brand of DVD's. So far they worked flawlessly and I'm over 1/3 of the way through the spindle. All DVD's I've used thus far have been perfect for video and data CD's. Worth the purchase price and Phillips has gained a new customer me; don't hesitate to purchase this brand and enjoy!
3,would get higher rate.if not for 3 disc write errors,item arrived on day expected.cases were broken when arrived however not bad enuf to return.ive had 3 disk write errors allready with Philips.would have gotten much better rating if not for those.never got error with any other dvdrbad part. will have more disk write errors with Philips then Verbatingood part.more space available to write movies.music.etc on Philips then Verbatin.
1,100 DVD Pack,Had good success with this product in the past. This last pack was a dud. At least 20% of these disc's are bad and will not take a recording. Tried to complain to their customer service. When I finally got a name and number their contact person (Ms Marty Lang) never bothered to get back to me.
4,Don't close your eyes,I have to agree with other readers when they say all Stephanie talked about was how she looked. I did't like that part of it but read on and quite enjoyed it.
3,Poss-ibilities,"This had possibilities, however the ego overruled and so did the hyphenated words, which slowed the flow of the reading.I would be interested in reading another of this writers works if those two components were smoothed out.I am talking about three and four hyphenated words per page. not just one or two.I couldn't fathom the reasoning for them. They didn't enhance the story."
3,Needs a better editor,I picked up this book hoping to really enjoy it. I could not get into the story because of all the hypens in the compond words. What the heck was that about? It made the story drag on and boring. I want to try another book from this author and I am really hope-ing he does-not over-do the hypens.
2,It wasn't terrible . .,". . . but it wasn't very good, either. I suppose the plot was alright and the story was told well enough, but there was waaaayyy too much time spent with the character talking about herself. For me there was too much time spent in the character describing helself than in what the characters were doing. I got the impression that this is just a man writing what he thinks a woman must be thinking. I suspect he got much of it wrong. In the end, this was really a poor man's Stephanie Plum. And you know that series petered out after the third book. Too much about the character and not enough about the story."
5,The Only Cookbook You will EVER need!,"This Covers it all. From the basic white sauce, to the Easy to make and Delisious Pasta sauce........all the way to Leg of Lamb, to all Fish Dishes and Deserts Galore. Easy to read and comprehend, it's like a kindergarten Cookbook for adults and the RESULTS are FABULOUS!A+++..."
4,Nice earrings,I gave these to my girlfriend. She loved them. They are as described. And they arrived on time.
2,Never got this item,"i never got this cd, i waited almost 3 weeks and no show. i had to file a claim, i didnt ever had to do that before."
3,glaring omission,Not once in the review is New Zealand mentioned. Has someone forgotten what the NZ in ANZAC stands for? Or is this part of the Australian illusion?
4,Good Arbor Press,Good arbor press for the price. I don't use it often but once a month when the need arises it works well.
4,Performance Accelerometer,"I am very satisfied with it. I have used it several times now. I would say it is pretty sensitive to the movement, speed and g force. For the price I got this, believe me, it is worth the money. I am pretty happy about it.I am also very satisfied with the instruction and how simple is to use it. It is not a complicated device you will be spending/waisting time to find out how it works. I also appreciate the fact that it is cordless and can be used on any car as needed. Very practical."
2,Fine while it works,"This monitor always produced a good quality image (the ""UltraBrite"" is worthless unless playing a game) but only lasted a few months. Note that the warranty on this series of monitors only lasts one year instead of ViewSonic's traditional three. Clearly there is a reason. ViewSonic used to produce excellent, reliable monitors, it is a shame."
1,A complete rip-off,"I paid over $300 for this monitor in 2003 and it worked great for the first 4 months. Then it started to flicker on and off and then completely stopped working. I fixed it myself to get it in working condition, but now the picture is all distorted. From what I hear, ViewSonic will not support this and you have to ""buy"" the schematics to even let a technician look at it. In my opinion, I could've spent my $300 on a different monitor instead of having to use my crappy backup 15"" monitor."
1,Item performs far less than stated,"This product is the worst crt monitor i have EVER used there are many terrible problems with this monitor including user settings not staying ,color drives erratically changing, text becoming blurry, and color spots (incorrect magnetism of phosphorus coating). The customer support and repair/replacement options are even worse. This company has the worst bureaucracy i have ever dealt with! I highly recommend you NEVER buy a product from viewsonic you will only end up getting SCREWED ROYALLY!"
4,Very soft!,"The color is true to the picture and the fabric is really soft. I just can't say how hot it is, since I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the coldest it gets here is 20C."
4,A must for Bradbury fans,"I always tend to think of Ray Bradbury as one of the science fiction masters. And that is not to say that this collection has zero science fiction, for it does. But there are several stories where Bradbury takes his skill past the sci-fi and fully into the heartfelt world he so often covers in his other books. The stories range from romance to the rainy worlds of Venus and every place inbetween as Bradbury demonstrates some stunning and always powerful imagination."
5,Exelente CD de Reggeton Cristiano!!!,Gracias a Dios por estos nuevos hermanos convertidos que alaban a Dios a su manera. lo recomiendo a las personas que gustan del regeton y el Hip-Hop. Lo Cristiano no quita lo sabroso.
2,bad disks,"This must be a particularly bad batch of disks. I had a 6% failure rate among them, all due to poor plating of the disks. I will stay away from the phillips brand in the future, they might be a name brand, but I've had better luck with no no name brands."
3,Philips DVD+R - not up to standard,"Philips DVD+R is sold for a very competitive [low] price but it is not the same quality as the other brandnames of the DVD+R sold by Amazon. I lost about 10% of the DVD+R, which was useless. Make sense to buy DVD+R that is a little more expensive and you could actually use all die DVD+Rs. Otherwise I am happy with the service and delivery."
5,A favorite!,"Normally, I find westerns dull as dirt and, because of that, I nearly passed this one up! I'm sure glad I didn't! It's easily one of my favorites with quotable dialogue, authentic costumes, and the best part of all: no less than SEVEN good-looking guys in leather and denim (Mr. Biehn in particular)! I've seen the original ""Magnificent Seven"" and I really find that comparing this to that is like apples and oranges. This was a thoughtfully-done series pilot with far more character history than the original offered. I just wish there were more episodes available."
5,'bout time!,"I have enjoyed Emerick's songwriting skills for a couple of years now and it is so wonderful that he finally has a cd of his own! I've heard him sing with Toby and I think he has a wonderful voice! ""I can't take you anywhere"" is one of my favorite songs!"
5,Proud of the locals,"I haven't gotten a chance to hear the new album yet, but I love their previous two albums, and enjoy catching them live when I get the chance. As a local of Johnson City, the Everybodyfields fall into the ""friend of a friend"" category in several directions, and so I'm especially proud to read that a group's album from our relatively small town made the top 50 albums of 2007 list in the December issue of Paste magazine! Congrats, guys! If you enjoy a bluegrassish indie feel (I hate to label them strictly alt-country, since I'm not usually a fan of the genre much), the Everybodyfields will rock your socks off... Or harmonize your socks off?"
3,"Smells awful, but it works","In the winter, the shaded sidewalks in our area ice up. Our HOA prohibits salt and similar products because they cause concrete to spall. This stuff (applied with a sprayer) melts ice making it easier to remove. It doesn't cause concrete to spall, but can leave permanent stains on natural stone surfaces."
3,review of Bare Ground de icer.,"review of Bare Ground Ice melter.The producr was as advrtized, delivered promptly. I haven't had enough snow and ic yet this year to really evaluate it. Had some snow, and areas I treated had less accumulation than areas I didn't treat. At around 30 degrees it melted some ice that had acumulated on steps."
1,sent the wrong one,i ordered beldar yhe male character and they sent me pyraat the female dam i guess nobody learned how to read
5,It's got it all,"Drama, mystery, sex and romance...this book covers it all. The characters are likeable and real people full of human contradictions. Some are confused, some are funny, some are loveable. The author captures the feeling of a past era, with songs, sports teams, phrases and issues which take the reader back to an exciting and tumultuous time in our history. And the descriptions of food...my mouth was watering. This was a book I could not put down."
5,A breathtaking experience,"This is a great movie that went beyond my expectations. Beautiful graphics, wonderful songs and a good plot to keep adults and kids entertained."
5,Sheer kinetic energy...,"Oozing instant ""get up & dance"" beats ""Rubicon"" is an exuberant, totally infectious slice of ""good time"" 80's house/synth catapulted into 2004 by Alan Braxe & Fred Falke. It's retro, it's French and it's so ridiculously addictive that it should carry a health warning. One of the best dance tracks of the past few years? Some claim... but as you ponder the question watch out for stray bodies bouncing off the walls. Best not to play too loud in company."
2,Not the highest quality,The scale feels cheaply made and the buckets came slightly warped due to the way they were packaged. The bears that come with it are fun for my daughter to play with.
3,"Ashley, who still knows what she's talking about","This CD disappointed me. Yes they're still good, yes Tairrie still writes amazing lyrics and packs a gut wrenching vocal...BUT the great moments are fewer and farther between. It's not the ""heaviness"" that turned me off on this one, because I listen to other stuff harder than My Ruin, but it just seemed watered-down to me. The lyrics aren't as good and her scream seems to have diminished a little bit. There's more ""I hate you, screw you"" and less intelligence, which Tairrie is famous for. I like the CD but will not rave about it like I would the first two. Anyway, good tracks are ""Spitfire,""Burn the Witch,"" and ""Bravenet."" I absolutely adore ""Bravenet."" THAT'S the Tairrie I know and love. But I also realize bands must shift and change in order to do be any good so let's just say I didn't like this change but it's still worth a listen."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This CD is overall not very good. The lyrics weren't written well and there is no originality, or emotion in the songs. I would not recommend this CD to anyone, and I advise everyone to not waste their money."
5,GREAT BOOK,A really great book that starts you off without using the wizards so that you can better understand what the wizards are doing for you.
3,ANOTHER HAIR SALON MOVIE,"JENNY IS BEING FORCED TO SELL HER SHOP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER DUE TO THE EMINENT DOMAIN, AND MUST ACCEPT THE MONEY SHE IS OFFERED. YET REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL ADVICE SHE RECIEVES, SHE REFUSES TO LET THE GIANT ORGANIZATION TAKE ONE REMAINING PILLAR OF HER INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOOD, DECIDING INSTEAD TO TAKE ON THE DWP IN COURT. A CLASSIC TALE OF THE UNDERDOG, THE SALON IS A FRESH LOOK AT THE INSIDE OF A SALON AND THE INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS. ENJOY THE RIDE AT...THE SALON, WHERE YOU GO TO GET MORE THAN JUST A HAIRCUT."
2,not worth a 2 year wait,"If you've seen Barber shop 1 and 2 dont even waste your time with this mess. I first got wind of this movie in 2005 and heard it was better than beauty shop and hair show, well it wasnt, at least those both were original, this took bits and pieces from every black small budget movie. It was ok, but not great, nothing to rush out and buy, I'd strongly recomend renting this before buying it."
3,It was okay,"I love Viveca and the rest of the cast of this movie.. esp Kim Whitley but this was just another Barber Shop, Beauty Shop movie. Yes, the humor was good a good addition to your african american cinema movies."
2,The Salon,Vivica Fox... is a very good actress... too bad she took this role... jokes a little funny... the fightin woman... typical... not enopugh storyline to hold a anyone's attention for too long..
4,The RVer's Bible,"The book is filled with a lot of great information, very helpful. I am glad I read it prior to purchasing my motorhome. The reference in the back of the book was wonderful. If one is planning to buy any type of RV, I would suggest reading this book first, even if you already have an RV, as this book goes over trading/sale of your RV & dealing once again with financing & sale people."
3,A handy tool,"Very american, but good for strategies , some of which worked, but I think I left my run too late. Just having it around the house, however, let the kids know, I was trying, I think they respected that."
5,Photo color is true.,"This blends in perfectly with the inside of the cabinets. It's tough to buy online for some things, but this is perfect."
4,it is what it is,"It's contact paper with a fake wood design.[Good]It works like you'd expect for contact paper, except it has a fake wood design.[Bad]It looks like fake wood.It's not cheap.[Verdict]I used this to cover a long DIY air vent under the couch. We have wood floors. It wasn't perfect but this product was good enough."
4,Good,"Great sshipping,works very good,for the project I had. Color was a little off. It was close but not as pictured"
2,A Minor Popular Work.,"Although the author of this work uses the right buzz words: ""Chaos"", ""Synchronicity"", ""the Hidden Order""; the depth of scholarship is lacking and on the whole the work lack rigor. Pass on this one."
2,Scooter cover for a Vespa,"This product claims to be size Large. It won't fit a Vespa LX-150.Advertising is misleading. The quality of this cover is poor, of course the cover was made in China. [...]Company claims shipping weight to be 12 pounds, the actual weight is 1 lb 14 oz."
1,Works Only For Administrators,"I just bought a F5D7001 for a home computer running Windows 2000 with multiple users. The installation worked fine for the administrator account, however the ""radio is set off"" when I log onto my son's account which is defined as a ""power user"". So, the card is unusable unless we log on with an account which is set up as an administrator.This is unacceptable ... I contacted Belkin support and they claim the problem is Microsoft, however a scan of the internet reveals many have grappled with this Belkin ""feature"" and there are no Microsoft solutions!If you only plan to use this on a PC as an administrator the price is right ... if you use a non-administrator account then you need another vendor."
3,Ridiculous,"I'm sorry if it disappoints someone out there but it's not possible to learn to ride well in all of the tasks that this book presents in a single weekend. I have taught beginners for several years and can honestly tell you that even if they are doing everything right, their muscles will be so sore after a single hour that their riding will start to become sloppy.Assuming that a person has never ridden before and is expected to walk, trot, and canter in two days is asking too much and may be dangerous. Most new riders can't even ""steer"" their horse correctly, let alone give it proper cues and execute a proper trot without losing their balance and falling off.The reason that I gave this book three stars is because the content is good for a person looking for a quick refresher course in horse terminology. The pictures are wonderful and the book is nicely presented. Just don't expect to really learn to ride in a weekend."
5,i luv adriane,"ya ok i LOVE this book because it is exciting and dramatic and intense and action packed!!!!!! To put it simply, if you love Adriane read this book because it is all about her, and i personally hate Kara so i loved this book!!!! though i wish there was some romantic chemistry between Adriane and Zach, that would be amazing because Adriane is SO AWESOME!!!!! read this book if you like action and coolness!!!"
3,slick but tedious,"Having limited experience with current adventure games, my viewpoint may not be that of the average gamer. I found TLJ at first to be beautifully rendered and initially engaging. It didn't take long, though, to become disillusioned with the game. The pace is agonizingly slow. One spends long minutes just watching April trot around the sets. Many of the puzzles are really ludicrous - I wonder, for example, if anyone could ever figure out how to get the Key without several hints. And the dialogues should be shortened considerably. My patience has run out and I am shelving the game for now."
3,haven't finished the game yet but...,it has kept me entertained so far. I like this genre of games but there is a little too much dialogue for me. Some sections are very long and wordy and you just have to sit and listen. The graphics are good so far.The only other issue is that it was extremely difficult to finally get downloaded correctly on my machine. I e-mailed the company for help suggestions several times with no response so that was very annoying. Finally got it up and running on another machine. That's my reason for only 3 stars... if the installation would have been more hassle free I would have given it 4.
2,"slow, slow, slow",could this game take any longer? And the conversations that you can't get out of... boooorrriiinnnnggg. Don't buy unless you have a lot of time.
1,Not a very engaging action film,"The ninja devices and techniques looked credible enough and the acting and story were fine.But for a really good Japanese period action film, I was probably better off spending my money on any of the Zatoichi or Lone Wolf and Cub movies."
4,A good replacement for Hennalucent,"After years of using Hennalucent to give my brown hair body and shine, I was worried when it was discontinued. Colora Henna Veg-Hair Apricot Gold seems to be a good replacement. The colour may be a little too light for my hair, but it does make my hair shinier and fuller and I intend to try some of the other colours offered. It seems grittier than Hennalucent and requires a little longer application time...but otherwise it is quite comparable and I will definitely buy it again."
1,Not as easy as it looks!,"I really hoped that this drill was going to be easy to use. It came without directions or anything else in the box for that matter. We purchased the recommended drill bits that Amazon suggested and I have now broken 2 of them w/in 24 hours of getting this drill. The drill pinches your skin when you try to put drill bits in. My son cut his finger on the drill on his first try turning the handle. I can get drill bits into wood but cannot get them back out!I will now just go buy an electric drill, whick I should have done in the first place!! Frustrating!!!!!!!!!!"
4,No surprises,"Like other reviewers, i was surprised at how small this was, but it does what it was meant to do (which for the time being was just drilling a minor hole in a not all that challenging wall)."
1,A waste of my money,This book was a completely waste of my money. For someone who is devoted to the catholic religion maybe it would be a great book (because they wanted to see it like that). But if you are someone neutral you will find it absolutely stupid.
2,Authors content good but reprint quality poor,"I love Jane Sassaman's work, technique and book, however, when the book arrived it differs from the original. Her name isn't listed at the top of the cover like the original book from 2000. Also, the pages appear to be copied, not the glossy quality pages and photos of the original book."
5,Helps if you start them young,"Like others, I have found that some cats have no problem (or even like) having their teeth brushed but others will take off as soon as you approach them with the brush. Starting brushing when they are still kittens will ensure they are okay with brushing as they get older. If you can get into the habit of brushing, it makes all the difference in terms of long term health for you cat. It's a great product and it seems to take only one brushing per day to be effective."
1,This is not a tribute!,"I just listened to the samples, and i can't believe this is real. If your going to cover a blink song a)put some effort into it and b) use PROPER instruments! They are taking the piss out of blink and making idiots of themselves, this is awful it ruins everything about the songs they are 'covering'. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE BLINK!!!"
1,omg,I hate this cd. Blink-182 is seriously the best band ever and this cd SUCKS!I really give it no starts but it made me give 1 star.
3,Not bad but missing some major styles,"This book promises to be the complete guide to kung fu styles, in some ways this is true, in other not at all. If we are comparing this book with most of the other variants knocking about then this probably is the complete guide! If we look into kung fu styles then this is not. At over 1000 in china no book can document all of them, and most of the family styles would not allow themselves to appear in such a book. This book should have been called 'The Complete Guide to Western Known Kung Fu Styles', as it gives pretty good if not broad information on most of the styles we know. I was very dispointed to find that some major animal styles were missing though.Overall I would say an interesting read, and at around 10 you cant really complain about some styles missing,"
4,"A primer for new therapists, reminders for others","This presentation, by two experienced Canadian child psychologists, is a step by step address to the evaluation and therapy of children who have been abused and neglected. Their work is sensitive to all of the issues and particularly mindful of the role of the therapist as initial stranger/intruder. The guidance about the role of the therapist as a attachment object for children, who can potentially become critically important in the negotiation of the child's world in foster or home care, is core to their approach to healing.Well written and especially useful to new therapists, this book makes liberal use of case material and children's drawings as examples of the ongoing process of therapy. The address to the role of the therapists liaison to caseworkers and courts, although from a Canadian view, will be helpful to all who struggle with dysfunctional systems."
4,The man without a country review,"The man without a country is basically about a man who wishes not to hear his countries name, and was very surprised when he got his wish.From then on the judge made everyone keep their mouth shut around him.Including cutting paragraphs out of newspapers and hiding flags,ect...I think he learned his lesson and maybe he will think about what he is gonna say before he actually says it. He learned is lesson and suffered the consequences."
3,software issues,"I was never able to install the software for this thing. Not only that, it crashed my computer a number of times and made subsequent restarts and shutdowns really slow.I ended up going with a linksys after I returned this one. The linksys software didn't quite work either, but at least it didn't crash the computer.What I ended up doing was just using the drivers windows has to run the card and it works perfectly. I would imagine this would have also worked with the belkin, which is quite cheaper.If you're still in the market for a belkin card, don't install the software. Just run window's drivers and I'm sure it'll work just fine."
