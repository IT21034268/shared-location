1,Grat Idea....Terrible Execution,"As a fan of sim games like SimCity and Free Enterprise (to name but a few), I purchased this one thinking that the concept of operating a fast food chain had great possibilities....unfortunately, Activision has blown this one. First, if you want instructions, you are out of luck. Next, the tutorials are meager to say the least. Throughout the game, the icons that drive everything you do are hard to decipher without using the help feature. To really start playing this game and to know what you are doing would take hours since the only way to learn it is through a great deal of trial and error (much more than any other games of this ilk).In a nutshell, this game disappoints."
1,Utterly Terrible...,"This game was terrible, I installed it, and it was not realistic at all. I could not even find the exit button! Each button had an icon, which was very difficult to make out. I usually do not write reviews like this, but with this game, I had to tell potential buyers of this game to STEER CLEAR."
1,Very Disappointing!!!,"I started reading this book and had to put it down. There is no doubt in my mind that autism is caused in most cases by mercury in vaccines. However, this book is very poorly written. Credibility is lost when the author hasn't bothered to proofread the book. I noted numerous punctuation, grammar and other errors in just the first 15 pages. The foreword by the MD twice states that thimerosal has now been banned in children's immunizations. This is incorrect (although I wish it were true). This book turns out to be one long rant against the republicans. Believe me, it isn't just republican politicians who are taking the pharmaceutical company money. Both sides are to blame, although I will concede that republicans are probably more involved in this public health disaster than democrats. Trust me too, when I say that socialized medicine isn't the answer! I really wanted this to be a good book and in fact bought three copies. It is truly awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
1,2 bricks,"I have long since thrown these in a closet, but couldn't help throwing my review in. These are horrible. I have two bricks that used to be called the Linksys RVS4000. Both failed, support is horrible, and it was easier to just toss them then try to get replacements. Beware."
1,Buy anthing else but this!!,"The RVS4000 is not what it appears to be. Says it is a Gigabit router, but it will slow your network to a crawl. I am using a mix of 100Mbps and 1Gbps devices on my home network, but the maximum throughput through this ""high speed"" router is about 15.8 Mbps. So unless you're pining for the old days of 10Mbps speeds, stay far away from this piece of junk.Lastly, you can nearly double the speed (to almost 26Mbps) by disabling all the features of the device, but if you have to have everything disabled in order to use it, and you still can't get Gigabit speeds, why would you want it in the first place?"
1,Stay Away... Far Away!,Worked flawlessly for a little over a year and then started dropping daily. Latest firmware upgrade didn't help and NOW the router is not consistently accessible via the web interface. Support is hella confusing and updates difficult to find. I spent the extra $$ hoping for quality and failed completely.
1,too much jamie kennedy,"i think the title says it all, this movie would have been better if they would have stuck with the stand-ups and actors, but it just becomes a whine fest for jamie kennedy...... this movie is good for about 15 min. thats about how long the comedians interviews last!!!!!"
2,Some 'Whine' With Your Cheese?,"I liked the idea of 'Hecker' but the execution left me wanting...wanting something different, wanting LESS of Jamie Kennedy. This doc quickly moved from what I would call 'traditional heckling' - the live, often brutal audience taunts to written critiques/critics in a heartbeat. Stinko wouldn't be a fair assessment of this for me but I must say by the end I wanted to punch the whiny Kennedy (I never DID think he was funny). Still, I'm a docu-addict and enjoy seeing any actor behind the scenes with their hair down."
5,Good moto boots...,Bought these for my motorcycle to protect my ankles. Very good boots and have held up well...
2,"Should be a draft edition, not a finished product","This ""book"" --draft is a better term -- was originally translated in 2002. Since then it has been reprinted nine times. This is rather shameful as the translation work is incomplete, and there are many errors in the text. Nevertheless, it does have one redeeming quality: beautiful, artistic illustrations. It only cost me $7.99 at Border's Books, so I am going to keep it. I also have better anatomy manuals on hand for reliable text.If you seek a more reliable anatomy textbook with more perfunctory illustrations consider: Marieb's Anatomy & Physiology. If you seek a general reference for all audiences, consider the Mayo Clinic Family Health Book or Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary."
2,Nice pictures,"The reasons i kept this one were that i bought it for $8, and it has pretty good drawings. The text and labels contain a ridiculous amount of misspelled words, untranslated Italian, and layout flaws. If you can afford to buy another anatomy atlas, don't buy this one."
5,Great for rubber band balls.,"One of my students got interested in making rubber band balls. His ball is now 8 inches in diameter, and standard rubber bands won't fit. These alliance bands are perfect!"
3,Nice phone but ringer is DOA,"This is a very nice telephone that works perfectly placing or receiving calls. The only problem with it is the fact that the ringer does not work regardless of the volume lever setting. For me this no real problem as it is in our kitchen and other phones ring in the house. I know I can return it to Amazon but I don't need the hassle at this time. I understand this telephone is USA made so I would expect it to work properly. When I move the volume lever all the way up or down it just makes a muted tapping sound, no ring at all. I guess I'll keep it though, despite no working ringer."
4,Almost Perfect,"Ordered phone as a Christmas gift for my parents to replace their Western Electric phone that finally bit the dust! No trouble installing, transmitted sound quality excellent. Only disappointment is the phone DOES NOT RING. For what I paid, wanted to return, however, they didn't want to wait for new one to arrive. Hope quality is as good as reviews stated."
5,love this flat iron,This is a great product. I am very pleased with the flat iron and also with the delivery. Overall I'm very happy with this transaction.
3,OK but original version is better,"It wasn't readily apparent until my son got this game that the colors are horrible for this game compared to the original. He enjoys it and frankly hasn't said anything about it but for me personally, I'd have preferred the original version with the better color scheme.I can't really recommend this over the original version. The design of the original as well as the colors is much better."
1,way too long to get here.,"The movie was fine. The length of time it took to get here wasn't. After contacting MovieMars numerous times, I was told to go to the post office and find it myself! They finally agreed to send me another movie but of course it arrived AFTER Christmas. The original order was placed in November! Their customer service is lacking, to say the least. I won't order from them again."
4,Good for commuters,"Honestly these CD's will not provide you with anything you won't find in any other resource. What they are good for however is getting you into the exam state-of-mind and for reinforcing what you are learning or reviewing through other materials. The authors/voice talent are pretty lame, but they try to do the best they can with the material.If you spend a lot of time commuting or have to make extended drives, these CD's are good to listen to in the background."
2,Book doesn't address everyday type of questions,"I bought this book b/c my daughter just turned 4 I am anticipating that she'll be asking more questions about her adoption. I was disappointed that this book is very basic and addresses more about Foster care situations. I was hoping to find a book that would be a Christian approach to handling adoption questions, but this wasn't the book."
3,Unable to adjust the sound,"I love that the transmitter will recharge my Zune. However, the sound quality isn't great. I have to turn my car stereo up to hear my music. Because I have to turn it up so high, there's this hissing sound from my car speakers."
1,FM Transmitter for Zune,"Let put this way , the ideal is good but the product is not so good .The Zune doesn't even plug in the Transmitter ( the alignment is not very good)"
2,Poor Quality - Great idea,"I have had this for several months now and I have to say when it worked, it was great - That was short lived. After a month and a half of use, the FM transmitter went out. This was not a problem in our new car since it is equipped with a line-in attachment and this device has a line-out connector on the bottom - very handy. Another 3 months later and this thing Totally dies, except it still charges the Zune, so it became a handy charge cradle. Transmition typically was weak but the ability to program a few presets was handy - Like I said I was happy with it while it worked but really disappointed when it failed - especially at the price they were asking."
1,Only works with the 30 GB,"Doesn't function on any other zune than the 30 GB. It doesnt say anything about that in the specs, so avoid this one if you have the 4 GB or 8 GB. I ordered 2 and neither one worked for me."
2,It worked only worked on one station,Could have been the area I was living but this only worked on one station and we stopped using it after it become more frustrating always trying to search for a new station.
1,Equivalent to an AM station with poor reception,Doesn't work well at all. We never could find a clear channel. There was always a background hiss at a minimum. Usually there was too much static to hear the music. We constantly were trying to find clearer stations while driving (passenger was doing the tuning). It cut the volume in half. We had the volume on the radio up full blast (38) and it just amplified the static. We tried it in two different vehicles with the same poor results. We sent it back to Amazon yesterday for a refund! Trust the reviews and DO NOT waste your time or money!!!
2,Very Dissapointed in The Zune TuneBase!,"I am very dissapointed with TuneBase FM Transmittter. I searched high and low for an FM Transmitter which would enable me to position the Zune in an upright and safe position in my automobile. The TuneBase fulfilled this requirement, however performed poorly as far as reception is concerned. The reception was terrible. Also, I was not able to tune to 87.9, which is the only station that will work where I live. I bought this produce because it has the base for the Zune, however the transmitter is not better than the Zune tranmitter purchased from Microsoft. Belkin needs to go back to the drawing board a develop the product the right way instead rushing to the marketplace with an inferior product."
2,Check it out closely.,"I ordered this to go with the 80GB Zune that I got my kids for Christmas. Looks neat, but the funny thing is that it WILL NOT WORK WITH THE 80GB ZUNE. I had to return it."
3,Doesn't work in my van,I received this as a gift but can't use it because my cig. lighter is too far away from the radio to pick up a signal. My boyfriend also bought one and he loves his. Has had no problems with it. I've been told I could still use it if I bought a cord to plug into my mp3 audio line in my car stereo but don't know what kind of cord??
2,50/50,"My kids both got Zune players and I bought 2 of these accessories also.One worked perfectly. The other had static, never could find a good channel and was a bust. If you like gambling, this is the product for you.I must say that the Amazon return process is very quick and easy. That was a plus I did not expect."
4,A good choice,"i live near a big city so there arn't alot of avalible frequencies to use. however when you find one that works, this product works well. it is also difficult when you are traveling long distances because you have to constantly change the brodcasting station."
1,Bad product,"I tried to make this product work in three different cars and it was not possible, just in one I get something but just a funny noise. A friend of mine also get the same product with the same results"
5,GREAT but with details,"Unlike the Ipod the Zune has its headphone jack at the top this allows me to hook the Zune directly into my car stereo for better sound quality. If you want to know why I got this Tunebase transmitter, its b/c it was cheep and holds/charges my zune in my car allowing me to watch videos with it being held upright. It is good for what I want it for, but if you plan on only using it as a Tunebase transmitter like it was intended be careful, its not that good quality and you should seek other alternatives."
2,Needs work,Very hard to see stations in sun light all so very noise sound quality very bad needs improvement very disapointed with unit
5,Very well written,"This book never drags, and kept my interest throughout. Different from a Special Forces story, Burns seemed to be on the receiving end of enemy fire most of the time while he guided helicopters for landings. He knew some of the other well known authors on LRRP's and special forces in Vietnam. He was lucky to not be hurt while being blown over by mortars or lightning, and also have a dud mortar round land a foot away. Very upbeat and refreshing."
5,Riveting account from a unique point of view,"I could not put this book down! I am so glad the author was convinced to write this book, it was an important story to tell. The story was told well, from event to event, and in a way that simply made me feel I was right there. The descriptions were vivid and understandable, and I was glad to learn about these heroic Pathfinders. What a remarkable thing that so many young men performed such amazing jobs under such amazing pressure. I'm glad I read about this unique segment of the Vietnam war - I'm continually amazed and humbled to read these accounts of a war that so many knew so little about at the time."
4,Good for Intermediate to Advanced Players,"Lots of great tips interspersed with interesting stories from Tiger about past golf situations. Great pictures. This book doesn't start from square one, though, so is not the best choice for beginners. It makes a great book for intermediate to advanced players."
3,Sentimental value for Woods's fan,"This book's title (""how I play Golf"") sums up precisely what the book is all about. It is about Woods' approach to golf. For his fans, like I am, would love it. I am always fascinated in how great sportman thinks on and off the field, and Woods is defintely in that ""great"" category. In that regards, this book is fine (if it comes with Wood's signature, it would be an collector item!) However, if anybody take the book as an instructional book, may find some disappointments. For that, I feel that David Leadbetter's instructional's books or videos are better bet."
5,Golf Instruction by Tiger,"My husband is LOVING this book. Very specific, useful instruction ""from the greens, back to the tee"" from the master. Clear descriptions with photo examples. Terrific!"
1,Horrible purchase,"After a week or so of use, treadmill is pretty much dead in the water. Programming is awkward to begin with, but for some reason I can't even get the thing to start up properly now...I'll begin to program in a workout regimen and the damn thing shifts back to the start screen after mashing a couple of buttons. Or, even worse, I'll get the thing programmed and the treadmill simply stops after getting maybe 30 seconds into my routine. Customer service at Horizon is a joke. They've mailed me some part that hopefully will cure this hunk of junk, yet I'm still trying to figure out how (and when) they'll get a technician out here to actually complete warranty repairs. I highly recommend against purchasing this item."
1,T54 Treadmill not what it is made out to be,"We purchased this treadmill for our small company's gym, based on the descriptions allusion to it being heavy duty. We had only used this treadmill 3 times before the touch pad stopped working. The company finally replaced it after at least 6 calls and complaints, claimed warranty was only for home use. When we finally got it working the safety key shows as unplugged unless you jiggle it and then reset the power to the treadmill. All in all I have been disappointed with the quality of the unit and even more so with the service from Horizon."
3,The Story of an Earnest Life,"If you're even the slightest bit tempted to self-pity, you'lldiscard it after reading this book! AStonishing, that one woman could havelived through so much, and maintained her equanimity. Could only havehappened with Christ as her guide and support!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1117723852/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,A must Read!,"""Over my Head"" by Claudia Osborn is simply the best book I have read on traumatic brain injury. She communicates precisely and eloquently my personal experiences when I cannot. Her book is a gift to all survivors, their family and friends for providing a comprehesive account of the turmoil that churns inside of our heads. Dr. Osborn addressed the experience that her (my) family and friends are dealing with from the effect of a brain injury, the loss of whom they had known, and the embracing and acceptance they showered on her. She provided a comprehensive account of my new life that gave my family and friends a gift of understanding that I could not. I applaude her for her courage and her accomplishments. I thank her for what her book has given all of us. It has been the single most important literary work that has moved us all forward.God bless and I celebrate the journey with you."
5,Used for educational purposes,I purchased a number of these to use as vocabulary lists for my student groups. We use the back of the cards to write out math vocabulary words and file them alphabetically. Worked out great!
5,Its About Time!!!,"I first heard this album back when I was in high school. I'd already been listening to Ministry for a few years, and a friend of mine asked if I'd ever heard of The Revolting Cocks. Needless to say, I was floored when I heard it and found out it was a Ministry side project. Of course I bought the tape, and listened to it for many happy years until someone stole it. Now its available again, along with all the other older releases, thanks to RykoDisc and Grandpa Jourgenson, so us old farts and a new generation of fans can enjoy the entire spectrum of Al and companys musical genius."
1,Not designed for thru-hiking,"The Companion has a lot of information, but most of it is designed for people who are interested in things that are in towns or off the Appalachian Trail, not for thru-hikers. It is harder to follow than the other guides, and is sometimes confusing in that it rates places based on only a few people's feedback it seems. If you are planning to do a thru-hike and want to do mostly hiking and not touring towns, then I would use The Thru-hiker Handbook by Wingfoot. It is easier to follow and doesn't try to tell you everything, just what you need as a thru-hiker. I traded my Companion for Wingfoot's book and never regretted it."
3,"A lot of Talk, No action","This book is very informative, yet it is geared to very advanced level. There is more verbage than actual information being passed from the wirter. If you are looking for this book, you know what to expect, if not you will be in for a little surprise."
2,Its an ok book.,"I had wished this book was actually newer with more information on the latest bee problems facing us in North America. The book is written well, but sort of outdated being written in the 90's. Over all it was a decent read, but I wished I hadn't purchased it along with the beekeeping for dummies book."
1,Not what the description said.,"I specifically picked this hammer because the description specifically said it was dishwasher safe - our last hammer was accidentally destroyed in the dishwasher. Therefore, we ordered this one.When it came, not only did the package say that it was NOT dishwasher safe, there was an additional sticker on the handle that said not to put it in the dishwasher.It works as a hammer, but the one reason I purchased this unit over others turned out to be completely false."
1,Awefull Book!!!,"This has been one of the worst book I have every bought!!! You cant really use it if you dont have any previous knowledge of the material... And for those that have to use the book and have no choice because its the class textbook, dont even bother to look for the solutions to the exercises. The book does not come with any solution what so ever to any problem in the book. And dont try to look for it online beacause its RESTRICTED to professors only!!!! There is no help from Cambridge in this matter. They have no sense of helping students achieve better grades or to overcome this difficult course. If you dont have to buy it, DONT, it will not help anyway!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!"
4,Good extras,Nice additional ideas for further adventures in Iceland. Need a clearer pronounciation of those tough words for those of us not of Scandinavian/Norse background. And a guide to the nearest tire repair shop would be helpful...those country roads are rough on the tires.
2,Take critical thinking one step further...,"...and use the techniques in this book on the book itself. Sadly, a book with so much promise falls victim to its own PR machine all too often. Face it, if you're going to use critical thinking, use it consistently. If you use it against what you don't like, but cast a blind eye on things you are passionate about, how critical is that, really?"
3,OK.,"The card stock is MUCH thinner than in the past, therefore the cards get damaged more quickly. Otherwise, this product is fine."
4,Good price,I've looked around forever for good prices on these Rolodex card files. This one was well priced. I only wish I could find one like this with slightly large card and quantity capacity (say 1000 card capacity).
3,Best of Nina,"I wanted an album that would give me all of Nina's hits and this is pretty good. There are some songs that I don't care for at all but it is hard to get every title that I wanted on one album so this was my choice. Some seems like fill time but again, I got a lot of the great titles I was looking for. What a voice!"
4,Rolodex Card File,"Excellent product for home use. I had to take a few cards out to allow the cards in use to have plenty of room to move. The file is small enough to fit almost anywhere, yet large enough to hold plenty of info."
3,Serves purpose but not of greatest quality,I wanted a Rolodex for business cards and this item served that purpose. There are two issues that detract from its usefulness:1. The roller mechanism does not easily turn. The cards have to be manually manipulated.2. The individual sheets easily pull off of the plastic holders so unless one wants to take a card completely off one has to be careful about handling it.I thought that the price of this item would ensure a better quality product.
5,GREAT book was made into a great movie,"I saw the movie Love, Honor, Obey: The Last Mafia Marriage which is based on this book. I enjoyed the book because it filled in some of the gaps from the movie.The book and movie show just how hard of a life these women had. The men were always in control and decided everything. The women could not even have control of the money. The had to depend on their husbands. When there was no money, it was up to the woman to make do.These people lived a very hard live. It definitely not a glamorous as it looks like in the movies.This book was well written and a good read. I am glad that I finally read it. It is well worth the money and time it takes to read it. This is a book I will read again."
3,Alright,"This keyboard is pretty decent. It works perfectly fine so far and I love the USB hubs, which is the one and only reason I bought this. I could not find any other keyboard with that feature. Really, all keyboards should have that. It is so convenient. However, the one major gripe I have is that whoever designed this decided to move the Caps Lock key to the bottom for some reason. Its somewhat annoying because I keep forgetting it is down there. Other then that, its a good buy."
1,its too big,keys are too big and have to push little bit hard every time. tired. no apple mark on the key ...
4,Great for the price,"I was using an eagle tone mic and no preamp and still got a preddy good sound out of the mbox, protools on this was easy to use, only problem i had was it not being compatible with my windows 64 bit vista or my windows 7 OS even on xp mode, had to buy a whole new computer with xp"
1,Poor audio quality,"I found the audio noise floor to be about 3X higher than when I just used my large dia. mic and tube pre-amp going straight into Mac mini...Also the tech. support won't assist without registering the product, which I did (thinking I was doing something wrong), and latter discovered that registered items are non-returnable (from different store, don't know Amazon's policy). The noise floor didn't change even when I put my same tube pre-amp into line level input on the Mbox 2. The software might be great, but would strongly not recommend the Mbox 2 hardware at this time."
2,A little too preachy for me,"For some reason, this author's style doesn't appeal to me. I think it has to do with her detailed commentary. Although I usually like this, I found that her opinions were so pervasive throughout that it gave me little room to do my own thoughtful meandering. I haven't tried too many recipes out of the book, truthfully...but I have reviewed every recipe and am only inspired to cook two or three of them. Too much first person!"
2,Got to take to signing,"Deborah Madison came to my local library and I wanted to have some books to be signed by the author. I got this book and I plan to make zero of the recipes from this book. I didn't care for the author in person or in writing. She isn't even vegetarian and spent 90% of her time complaining about her publishing house and publishing houses in general. My father worked in publishing for 20 years, so I didn't care for the hate spiel. I don't think her recipes are very practical and her pretentious nature, which I assure you is apparent in person as well, just stinks up the whole book. I got this signed and hope to sell it soon."
3,Not what I was expecting.,"Maybe I misunderstood but I was expecting a book that was more about teaching how to make paper airplanes for my boy. The book does a good job of teaching about how an airplane flies but does little to teach you different designs. It does come with many ""cut outs"" that I guess you could copy but I haven't found them to be that great. Not to mention when it takes 10 mins to cut and fold the cut outs my 5 year old loses interest."
3,Cinderella by Justina,"I like this story, of how someone not so fortunate gets to go to a ball and look like a princess. Also at the end of how Cinderella gets chosen by a prince and gets to live with him happily ever after!!"
4,Rock lives!!!,"Ten are a UK based band who have been churning out album after album for the past few years, and have a strong European and Far Eastern fanbase.Thia is their third release, and it's a good one. The songs are strong - hints of '80s Whitesnake in the style, although Gary Hughes' vocals are very distinctive; he never screams, and sticks to a low register. But he's also the main songwriter, so that's his perogative.The only gripe (and loss of a star) is the production. Mike Stone must have been, well, stoned, when the mixing took place. The guitar is buried, the cymbals too prominent and trebly, and I'm sure I could have done a better job with a bit of practice.But a good album, and not a bad introduction to the band."
3,"I liked this book, but not as much as others by Howatch","I am a longstanding Howatch fan, and had fun reading this book, but not that much fun. Howatch writes excitingly, and sex and religion are still a potent combination. But overall I felt that the Wonder Worker simply retread the ground of the Starbridge series to less effect. The character of Nick Darrow - crucial to the plot - had lost its clarity and humanity from earlier incarnations. And Alice just annoyed me. I'm sorry I didn't wait for the paperback."
2,Not in the same class,"This is not in the same class as the other CofE books. Page after page of tedious psychobabble that does not move the story forward. About 100 pages could have been cut.The characters are awful: Lewis has deteriorated in a boring old curmudgeon, Stacy is just too infantile for words, Nick seems to have no regular common sense insight (much less psychic ability). These people are terrible priests and should be fired / defrocked!And the ending is just ridiculous. I can't tell you why without spoiling it, but suffice it to say, it is not true to anything that has gone before.Of couse, I read the whole, huge thing because I has to see what happened, so there must have been something redeeming there to catch my attention."
2,Not nearly as good as the series,"I was very disappointed in The Wonder Worker. Alice was the only voice I really could read. When we got to Lewis I just skipped over much of his complaining and read the rest rapidly to get the gist of the plot. The Starbridge series was compelling and the theology interesting, so Howatch's secular novel disappointed me."
2,I don't recommend it,"There is not graphics information, it is to dense, I don't recommend itThere is so much text without graphic information"
3,good book if you can ...[edit] errors,"Overall, this was a good read -- especially for existing programmers who are looking more at ADO.NET for things like architecture, usage, differences with ADO 2.x, etc... The book greatly simplified ADO.NET in my mind, and gave some great starting points in my own research.My only problem with the book is that there are quite a few errors in the text that, in my opinion, the editors should have caught. For example, if you're new to OOP, you'll probably want to know the difference between overloading a method and overriding a function. This book on several occasions uses one term where another should have been used and vice-versa.Overall, however, this is the best book on ADO that I've read so far..._howard"
5,Truly beautiful album,"Right from the spine-tingling opener ""One Crowded Hour"", Augie March sneaks up in your subconscious like a cruise missile rather than bluntly shoving hooks in your face like many in popular music today. The gentle landscapes painted by their laid-back musical style and poetic, softly crooned lyrics generate an introspective, calm feeling. Augie March are a treasure and continue to produce awe-inspiring, grow-on-you music."
3,Somewhat repetitive,"This band was new to me. I think the single, ""One Crowded Hour"" is fantastic. It's got a great hook and a pretty fresh sound, but too many of the other songs on the album have the same exact texture. Slow to mid tempo folk rock. Because of that I think the other stand out tracks on this album are the tunes that experiment with the instrumentation like ""Honey Greer"", the country number or ""Bottle Baby"", which is a sort of Dylan pastiche. To be fair, one of the things that people who like this band frequently mention is the literary lyrics but because of the way the vocals are mixed into the wash of sound production, I frequently can't make out what the dude is saying and so everything sort of faded into the background. In short, pleasant enough, but I don't come back to it very often."
4,I loved this book!!!,I nlove everything that Koontz write. It is so much better getting three books in one!!!
5,"O Come, O Come Immanuel to ransom captive Israel",Wonderful movie which should be played by everyone believing in Christ Jesus and his Miracle birth.
4,Good deal,"i had no issues with the product, it was delivered on time, product fit the description, good shipper"
2,"Pointless ""upgrade""","Be warned: sonically speaking this new upgrade is no different that the version of this that was available many years ago. I felt royally screwed after getting rid of the old versions and spending quite a bit of cash to upgrade all the albums only to find that they sound EXACTLY the same! This is a great album but if you own the older version there is no reason whatsoever to ""upgrade"" to this version."
5,If you like psych rock you must own this.,I could make a big list of bands that completely ripped this album off. This was just as influential on pysch/stoner rock as Hawkwind or Sir Lord Baltimore. If you are looking into the roots of bands like old Monster Magnet you need this.
5,SLEEVE UNDER ARMOUR,I HAD PROBLEMS FINDING THIS SHIRT FOR MY SON FOR BASKETBALL.IT HAS BEEN A FEW MONTHS SINCE AND IT IS HOLDING A ALMOST NEW LOOK.MY SON WANTS MORE FOR HIS 3 ON 3 TEAM SOON. WENDY
3,Its ok but not great.,"Arild Andersen is a good bass player by all means but the album was a bit dull to me. After hearing it a few times Ive only really enjoyed just a few of the tracks but not enough of them to have really needed to buy this album. Oh well!! I shouldnt say its all bad, one or two tracks has Ralph Towner playing very nice guitar but it wasnt long enough."
3,Solid Kraut - very 'full' album,"Good quality German Prog. Rises above most of the releases of its time. Amon Duul were around the best of the genre. Rockin, pshychadelic,lots of diversity between the tracks. This can be listened to for a long time. Demonstrates theior skill and versatiliy. Way ahead of its time. A little poppy for Amon Duul and in comparison with other krautrock, but dont let that scare you.Sounds german. Fun. The leadin tracks are perhaps the best.Actually, as I run through side A, it is very good.3.5 stars. But when comparing to german prog, perhaps its a 4."
5,What leaks?,"I just have to weigh in and say that we have been using Avent bottles for almost 5 months, from day one with our newborn daughter. We have NEVER had a problem with bottles leaking, and we do not assemble them wet, or tighten a specific amount, or anything like that. They do not leak even when I tip it upside down (with the cap on). Our bottles have never leaked. I think they are wonderful because they reduce the amount of air the baby sucks, are light enough for her to hold, and the markings have not come off or faded at all, even after 5 months of usage. Overall, I love these bottles and would recommend them to anyone."
4,So good I got it again!,"With my first child I got all Avent supplies, including the hand pump. I found that I love their stuff. Now that my second child has been born I found that I needed to ""clean up"" and add to my supplies so I went out and bought this product again. If you are breastfeeding primarily this is a great bottle because it helps to cut down on ""nipple confusion"". My daughter went from breast to bottle easily and my son seems to be doing the same. I noticed one person wrote that she had trouble with the bottles for her daughter. I have NEVER had a problem. I love this company and this is a great started set."
1,Terrible quality for the hype!!,"I wish I new just how much these bottles leak BEFORE I registered for them. The Gerber bottles I'm using now are SO much better in all aspects. I only use the avent bottles when I'm desperate and try not to take them with me when we go out of the house. I don't think that I should have to worry about how tight I've twisted on the top or weather or not all the liquid inside has leaked out into my daughter's diaper bag. To sum it up, these are just not good quality bottles. I would not recommend them to anyone."
4,Great product at a very low price,1. Got it at Fry's for only 14.992. It is overpriced at Amazon.com around $28.3. It is cheap because Casio is only giving youthe printer and a USB cable. It costs Casio more tomanufacture the input keyboard associated with thelabel printer.Good product.
3,"An important book, uneven writing","Gurian's book is well worth reading. His unitheistic approach to nurturing the light and soul of all children (including ourselves) is inspiring and hopeful. The sections on medical advances showing the special nature of our life-force and brain development were especially interesting and accessible, and I'd have liked him to explore these areas in more depth. My quibble with the book is on a stylistic level: given his subject matter, I could wish for a greater elegance and lyricism. The first third of the book, I felt, was heavy-handed and prosaic. His insistence on soul being equivalent to light seemed repetitive and not entirely supported. A recommended read, nevertheless."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Do not buy this cheap piece of junk! Mine broke after only a few light duty uses. It cannot handle even small amounts of torque being applied by hand! I'm not sure what qualifies this item to be called ""heavy duty"" but there is NOTHING heavy duty about this item. Please do not waste your money. A reputable seller would not be selling this junk."
4,Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antartic Expedition,"I first read this book, and then I read Alfred Lansing's ""Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage."" I enjoyed the pictures in this book, but found Lansing's description of the journey more engaging. My recommendation is to read Lansing's book together with using the pictures and maps in this book to help visualize the writers' stories."
5,amazing,This book was certainly a quick read. I was drawn into the ordeal and couldn't wait to find out how it all ended. This true tale is a testament to the sheer will of man to persevere against terrific odds.
3,Great Adventure but slow moving in the start of the book,"This book tells the tale of one of the most amazing survival stories I have every read. The raw courage and capability to beat the odds defies the imagination. The author builds the story in the beginning by helping us to get to know the principal players. However, the build up is slow and I found this part to be a little boring. However, once the ice starts to capture the ship, the adventure begins and so does enjyment in reading the book. The photographs are remarkable and do a nice job of helping prompt the reader's imagination about the terrible conditions these men endured. I found myself trying to imagine what it must have been like to be so far away from help, in extreme conditions with crude (by today's standards) equipment. Great adventure, but a little slow in the start."
2,flimsy rolodex cards,Didn't realize that some cards didn't come with openings to secure business cards. This one you have to tape or glue your cards in! And the paperboard is much flimsier than they used to produce. I'd return but I've had it too long and seems like too much trouble.
5,Companionship on our journey,"I was asked to walk alongside a woman recently and at the same time, due to my profession, was advised to seek out a spiritual director. Isn't it amazing how God orchestrates these events? Of course, I do feel I would benefit greatly from a more spiritual person and friend in my life. But of course, I do not feel worthy to be a spiritual advisor to anyone else. But this book is revealing alot to me. ""The task of spiritual friends is to help us discern the Presence, will and leading of the Spirit of God."" Together we will open ourselves and grow toward that intimate and closer walk with God. I haven't even finished this book, but already I am feeling a greater presence in my daily walk. I have always tried to be obedient to His service, but what is that obedience without surrendering to His love."
3,Nice,"Stones sturdy enough, not as ""glamourous"" as in photo, but good deal for money paid. nice everyday ring"
5,Glad I bought it,"Like others said, it was delivered with surprising alacrity. I do think it looks like the picture, but it was a little larger than I imagined. No problem with that, though, as my husband thinks more is ""more"" where jewelry is concerned.I didn't think the garnets were too orange, but then, I prefer garnets to the so-much-more-precious rubies because rubies can tend to be pinkish.I wish I could have gotten it in a size 5, but other than that, I would definitely buy from this seller again."
5,charming blooms,This everlasting fabric is charming with the bright blue background. I love all the patterns but this one remids me of the blue water in Hawaii! Very cheerful and casual.
2,Pretty Worthless,"Griswold's treatment of the books is disappointingly shallow. He makes a number of undeniably true observations about what children like, how they behave, what they seek out, etc - and then notes that various well-known books satisfy those desires. E.g., children like to feel snug, like to enclose themselves in small spaces - and guess what? that's exactly what you find in various children's books. Griswold doesn't devote much time to asking ""why?"" or to explaining the significance of any of these desires. The book is enjoyable but by the time you're done reading the author's very superficial discussion, your reaction is, ""well, I could have told you all that off the top of my head."""
3,Story didn't jump off the page for me,"I have read several of this author's other books and enjoyed them all (particularly ""The Saving Graces"") so I was enthused when a friend gave this to me when she had finished with it.I didn't dislike it but I didn't really get connected into the story or with the characters. I don't fault the writing style (quick and easy to read) but have decided it was the story line that didn't grab my attention. I found my mind wondering while reading versus eagerly skimming along to find out what happens next. I didn't find myself invested in the characters or what happened to them and don't fully understand why. While I really love historical fiction, this one didn't really utilize the sense of place or time very well and I think I would have liked that better.For me, I think I may need to stick with her more recent work that has a more contemporary setting. Not a bad book by any means, just not great."
5,ear phone flange sleeves,"They work well, not only increasing the pleasure of listening, but also cutting almost all of the outside noise out."
1,"Junk, very uncomfortable.","I bought these, put them on my Shure ear phones, wore them for about an hour and they made my ear canal sore. The packaging they arrived in is poor. They are going into the trash. Waste of money.I absolutely would not purchase these again."
1,Shure Sleeves,"I read customer reviews and brought the Shure triple flange sleeves. I was shocked and disappointed that the ear sleeves doesn't block out the ambient noise; poor noise isolation. In addition, they don't fit comfortable in my ear. I believe the best sleeves for noise isolation is the Shure gray rubber sleeves. Learn and live."
2,"they just look dumb in your ears, not as effective",I only started using these because they were the last set of sleeves I had left from the set I got with my E4cs. I hate these. They are so big that they stick out of my ear and make my ears look big. They are also much harder to fit in my ear properly... I have to wiggle them around as I shove them into my ear so that I can get the noise-canceling effects. I can't wait to get my order of the foam ear pieces cause I can't wait to throw these in the garbage! I gave 2 stars because they're at least still better than the standard iPod ear plugs.
4,Not the same as the manufacturer ones,"This is NOT the same as the original ones that came with from the manufacturer. These are more ""plastic"" and less ""rubber"" feeling when in the ear."
1,HL does not equal HP,"Our office got one of these since it was hundreds cheaper than a similar Hewlett Packard (HP) LaserJet. While I was a huge fan of HP LaserJets because in my years of experience with them they never, ever, ever complained, rarely jammed, and never died, I was willing to give the Brother (HL) a fair trial.What a mistake! Over a year's use in a small office (7 users) with fairly simple print jobs, this Brother printer would regularly hang and require a power cycle and random opening and closing of doors to make it reset.I never saw this sort of behavior with HPsThe moral? Laser printers have a lot of moving parts in a harsh environment (high internal temperatures and toner dust). You can get away with cheap monitors, motherboards, and almost anything else electronic, but with printers a cheap design will cost you downtime and frustration.If you value your time and rely on your printer, look at something more solidly designed. I recommend HP LaserJets.--Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu"
2,Disappointed,The vacuum base doesn't work. I suspect that the material (rubber?) on the bottom is old and something because it sure doesn't hold.
1,A major disappointment,"I bought this book because I was hoping to pick up tons of practical tips that I could apply to my everyday life as a working mom, but I found that it merely rehashed things I've read in every woman's magazine time and time again: plan ahead, make casseroles for the freezer, delegate, etc. etc. I much preferred Working Mothers 101."
2,Too involved for home cooking,"This book is loaded with good photos of Emeril and his crew, but comes up short on practical dishes the average cook can prepare. Many recipes involve ingredients that are only found at specialty markets, which are few and far between outside of major cities.Also, many dishes require extensive preparation of, for lack of a better word, ""sub-dishes"". For example, making the empanadas requires the cook to make the dough, prepare the fillings, and prepare two types of toppings; each step is a difficult recipe in and of itself.If you like Emeril and enjoy the challenge of restaurant cooking, this book might be good for you. If you'd rather leave the fancy fare to the pros who do it best, then skip the book and spend the money at the restaurant instead."
3,Emeril's TV Dinners,"I love Emeril.....but, this cook book contained many complicated recipes and was a bit hard to follow. I assumed (and you know what they say about assuming)by the title that these recipes would be everyday meals, but they aren't. If you are looking for ""special recipes"" for a ""special day"" then you'll have it with this book. IT'S A GREAT BOOK, but not you're everyday meal type of book. I'm still glad to have it in my collection."
1,tv dinners,"I think that this is the weak link in the series of books that Emeril has put out. It's great that he wants to share with all of his fans the behind the scenes pics of his show. However, the quality of the recipes suffers because of it. There are just too many pictures and not enough food. I felt cheated after I spent some time digging through it. I still love Emeril, but I really was dissappointed with the results of this book. It's just not worth the money spent."
1,"looks good, but...","The product looks excellet, coming with two heads and covers for travel use. But the plastic covers the power button crack in the 2nd weeks then the water went inside of the toothbrush and it were gone before I can get used to it. :("
2,SAME-SEX COUPLES CAN HELP THEMSELVES,"Betty BerzonThe Intimacy Dance:A Guide to Long-Term Success in Gay and Lesbian Relationships(New York: Dutton, 1996) 291 pages(ISBN: 0-525-94234-3; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: HQ76.3.U5B467 1996)A breezy, self-help book for same-sex couples,altho most of the advice would also help any couple.Nothing profound of insightful.But this is one of the first books that dealt with same-sex couplesas if this were a normal way to live.Some of the issues:jealousy; AIDS; public image; drug & alcohol abuse;working thru personal conflicts.Betty Berzon also shares stories from her own long-lasting lesbian love.She practices psychotherapy, especially with gays, in Los Angeles.If you would like to read better books on same-sex marriage,search the Internet for the following precise expression:""SAME-SEX MARRIAGE--FIRST BOOKS""."
2,Progress is not a bad thing.,"With all the pining for the limited technology/luxuries of past eras in this book, i suspect there might be a general issue with progress as well as the overconsumption of expensive gew-gaws. So i have mixed feelings...this book echos some of my already set sentiments about modern spending habits and classism. Overall, the book has a good message that could really do people some good. It comes from a good place and i see what the authors are trying to accomplish.... but i found the tone, slight paranoia and misplaced nostalgia to be a bit of a turn off. I was hoping to come away with a renewed, positive urge to carefully choose what i buy but instead began to resent being painted as a stupid, miserable, empty, American cubicle slave that hates their job and exists only to consume and defecate plastic flotsam all over my environment."
5,Are You Infected!,"Odds are you're infected with affluenza but, don't worry, there is a cure. You'll just need to take the medicine. This book is both entertaining and thought provoking.Take an honest look at the degree of your illness, make some changes to how you think and the results could amaze you. They say the best things in life are free but some of us had to buy this book (the book's not free) to really appreciate that."
4,great product,"I spent years looking through an old index for numbers. I transferred them all to this handy little flip-file, and now have instant access to them.."
2,Japanse Cooking,"Its hard to follow up with this book, I don't know where to get ingredients, I prefer to buy a video next time, despite that there are many recopies in the book, but its not will organized too much text, I want something to go straight and show mew how, when I ma hungry I don't have time to read a novel"
4,Wonderful cookbook; cd we pls have a metric version?,"I agree with all the reviewers who gave this wonderful book five stars. I am already familiar with Japanese cooking techniques, but still found myself silently thanking Ms Harumi (and her editor?) for the wonderful job they did giving really clear and well thought-out instructions, which ought to help even a rookie to turn out the dishes in the way the author intended.In fact, the only reason why I am giving this 4 stars, instead of 5, is that I do think -- and cook -- in metric, and this cookbook (well, at least the copy I bought in Singapore), uses American/ Imperial measures such as cups and ounces. But these recipes are well worth the effort of converting the measures... so do swing over to buying this book if you think it sounds appealing! If you are used to eating Japanese food cooked by Japanese people, the conversions shouldn't be a problem at all as you will be able to ""guesstimate"" the right measurements with just a bit of practice."
4,"White, Made In France","The political consciousness of the Dead Kennedysmixed with the precise minimal pop of the Buzzcocks.Add in some foreboding harmonies spread all through.These French lads had all bases covered. At times,some slightly off pitch singing...but it's easilyoverlooked by the cohesion of their collectivemusicianship.They were really something else at the time.Very invigorating, pulsing tunes."
5,"So good, the neighborhood ferals broke in to steal it!","As the title said, I bought a 1-oz bag for my cat, and made a little catnip pillow out of a few tablespoons of it. The rest of the bag I put out in the hall. A few days later after noticing a couple of shadowy figures darting out the cat door I went to get the rest of the bag and it was GONE. DISAPPEARED. I'm convinced the neighborhood strays broke in and stole the whole thing. It really is that good, and that pungent. My cat absolutely LOVES it and she sleeps very well after a half hour of play with her catnip pillow. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Not What I Expected,"From the description, I thought my catnip-loving cats would take to it quickly. Not so. They may just be used to the old catnip I'd been getting for them. Not bad, though. The cats eventually took to it, but not very enthusiastically"
2,Panasonic DMC-LX2,"I bought this camera, believing what I read in reviews. DO NOT buy this camera if you want to take a picture of anything that is moving even slightly. There is a function for taking sports images but it doesn't work at all. I try to take pictures of my 2 year old nieces and I have to delete most of them because they are VERY blurry. I'm a little confused by the rave reviews of this camera. It costs way too much for it not to be able to take a clear picture. Other than that it has a very nice design. i have another less expensive camera that does a much better job."
3,So far so so,"I have yet to be impressed by this camera. It feels unnatural to hold making me fear everytime that I will drop it. It is bulky and it fits quit uncomfortably in pants pockets.If you are switching from an SLR to a P&S; as I am, you may be disappointed by some of the shots.What disappoints me the most however is AMazon's service. I got this camera 1 week LATE. I had an option of buying from a cheaper merchant, but Amazon promised to send it to me sooner. I decided to pay more for an earlier deivery, but no. It was delayed. To make it worst, the price went DOWN after I bought it. Amazon should have a price insurance thing going. Very Very disappointed. (My SD card that I orderd with this came 2 weeks late)"
3,Almost really satisfied,"I have been giving Brother products a try lately. They offer a number of features at a relatively affordable price. I purchased the HL 1270N because of the affordability of toner and drum, the USB port and its built-in network interface card. Installation went fairly smooth. I found myself at the Brother website downloading Windows 2000 drivers which is no big problem. My hope was to configure the printer as a server through its NIC on my network. After three aborted attempts I attached it to a client using the USB port and went back to work. I haven't had a chance to get back to Brother customer service to try to set it up properly. I have been almost satisfied with all of the Brother products that I have purchased recently. My dissatisfaction could stem from our choice of the Windows 2000 operating system, but Brother should fully support Windows 2000. If you are not using Windows 2000 you stand a good chance of being a satisfied customer."
1,You and No Other,"I've never written a review, but after trying to read this book based on it's high rating, felt like I should give a heads up to those who prefer a heroine with some depth. This one has absolutely no common sense, is quick to anger (when she is in the wrong) and seems basically idiotic. She and the hero exchange deep kisses just about each brief encounter including their first. By about the fifth meeting, she quickly and unromanticaly loses her virginity in the bushes of a garden in a chateau. My waning interest in the book was completely gone at this point and I will not finish the book.I read another book by the author which I would have rated a two star because I did manage to read it. Her historical backdrops are interesting and she writes well. However, her heroines tend to be knot heads!"
3,"Round and round the story goes, where it will stop nobody knows...","Wow, what a long read for such a short story. This book was packed with french history and rich descriptions of some truly remarkable landmarks. However, the story really had no beginning middle and end. It ended quite randomly. There were so many misunderstandings and back and forth drama that I was thoroughly bored. The characters were likable but not memorable. The book could have ended 50% of the way through as a novella and would have been more than enough. If you like to read books that are long merely for the sake of being long then this is the book for you. However, if you like a story that engages and draws to a well sought out conclusion you would do better to read something else."
3,Wild Flowers for the accomplished stitcher,"The designs in this book are lovely but somewhat limited. The designs are broken into 9 sets of projects, such as gift tags, and bookmarks with a different floral motif per project. I was not particularly taken with the book as I was looking for something with more wild flowers and not ""projects"". There are roughly 17 different flowers or use of flowers in this small book. If you like flowers with long stems this is a great book for you, as most of the designs contain long stems. Not bad but not great."
2,Good for man hands,"This ricer is mediocre. The handle is large and difficult for my hands to get good leverage for ricing.The main problem is the fit of the press into the sieve. Gaps in the side cause food to leak out as your press, creating a lot of waste. The press fails to tightly press to the base also creating a wasteful gap.Poorly constructed. It works but not well."
1,Not Thankful For The Change,"I heard 'Incredible God, Incredible Change' on my car radio and went to the nearest Christian music store to purchase it. I just had to have that song right away, no delay. Well, I picked up 'It's Time For A Change' by mistake and I can't wait until it's time to make the exchange. But, I'm glad it did get good reviews from others who bought it. Actually, this is the first time I'd heard Youthful Praise and I wish them all the best, but I can truthfully say that I've never had a CD that I liked less than this one. Not one cut inspired me to keep it, as it got toward the end the vocals became so grating and harsh that screaming along with them was all I wanted to do. I'm so thankful that the owner of the store is gracious enough to replace it with the other one, at least I know that I'll absolutely love 'Incredible God'."
2,Dissapointing,"I first saw this a while ago and had very high hopes for it, as the 1935 classic is one of my all-time favourites. Unfortunately though this is a dissapointing film. Hopkins and Gibson are the only two interesting characters in it, and many great actors are shockingly wasted, especially Olivier and Fox, who are hardly even in it. The film has a different approach to the story and is not very well told, with Bligh a rather fair person who turns cruel for seemingly no reason, and he doesn't even approach the tyranny that Charles Laughton expressed in his unmatched performance, making the crew's mutiny seem almost totally unjustified. It also has the look and feel of a TV movie, and though out of interest I would like to see this new DVD in all it's widescreen glory, I am still holding out for a DVD of the definitive 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty."
1,The Bounty I never saw !!,I paid for a streamed version and never received it. I was charged for this and was not able to watch it.I wrote to you..........no response !! What kind of an operation are you running ???At least I'd like my money back. That's my review.Thank you.Dave Segadelli
5,For Seaman,"As an avid sailor, I love most anything filmed with the high seas as the backdrop and especially the wooden frigate eras.I had not seen the Bounty for many years, remembered it was good, just purchased it and was glad that I did. I agree with most of the other positive posts here with some additional comments.The Vangelis soundtrack will take you aback for a while. Wasn't sure I liked it at first as it is all synthetic sounds / instrumentation. Initially, for a period piece, it seemed out of place. Over time, I can appreciate it but think that in the end, a really great score with organic orchestral / tribal soundtrack would be better. The Vangelis reminds me a bit to much of Escape From New York. One thing though, the soundtrack is very sparse as is.Secondly, the attention to detail regarding the Bounty from it's hull to standing rigging is really spectacular.Need a large TV to really appreciate the scenery. I give it 4.5"
3,Gosh I wanted to like this movie more.,"When you rent a movie and find yourself fast forwarding through scenes you haven't watched before... I wish I hadn't read the book first. I made the movie drag for me, even with Mel in it.I gave it 3 stars for the beautiful photography, Mel and its fairly accurate protrayal of true events."
3,GOOD MOVIE BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,"I found THE BOUNTY to be more historically accurate than the other movie versions but at times this movie got to be too speculative on why the mutiny happend. ANTHONY HOPKIN""S performance is great as usual as welll as LIAM NESSIAN'S but I found MEL GIBSON to be too shallow as CHIRSTIAN. This movie does'nt really give you a clear picture of the notorious mutineer and why he did what he did. But not to fault it none of the other movie versions have either, my advice is too read about THE BOUNTY MUTINY, instead of watching any movies about it."
3,Need better quality control,"When the product arrived the roller mechanisum was jambed and wouldn't rotate. I ended up dissasembling the entire unit and had to streighten the metal stand to align the roller. Had to be careful because the knobs are plastic and can break if too much pressure is applied. Works good now. I assign five stars to the system and one star to the manufacturer, so split the difference."
1,do not purchase this item,do not I mean do not purchase this itemif there is an option for 0 star rate I will give 0did not work properly & out side gets hottor than inside
3,Steph's Review,I am enjoying playing this game very much. I have not completed all of them yet but it is proving to be worth the money so far. If you want a back to basics not really advanced role playing game this is a great place to start.
4,Harry Potter Collection,"I ordered this collection for my son. It arrived promtly, factory sealed and in excellent condition. My son loves the games."
4,Great Value!,"I bought these lights for my 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix SE, and you can't beat the value! I had priced these lights out at auto parts stores for $200 each side! I bought both sides, and was disappointed that the blinker lights were not in place, but that wasn't a big deal to replace. They look great, just like the originals, only new!"
1,Wrong part,I would give this company a negative rating if i could. I ordered the part next day delivery and didnt recive it for a week and a half. It clearly says on it PASSENGER SIDE and even the order form inside the box said PASSENGER SIDE however when i opened the box it was the drivers side not the passenger side like it said. I would not buy another part from these people if my life depended on it. Shippment came all the way from Arizona and it no wonder i got the wrong part probably a bunch of mexicans that cant read english.......
3,Better than that horrible 4kids version!!,"Better than that horrible 4kids version. However, the Funimation English dub version sucks too. Because most of the voices don't match the characters, and also Zoro voice is way too deep. Some English dubs are a little okay, but I still prefer the Japanese dubs in anime. Because most English dubs sucks and too painful listen to."
1,Don't brother,"Do not brother to read this book. I have bought a couple of Mr. Ellison's other books and found them to be informative, however this book is not worth reading. The best parts can be found in his other books. For instance his ideas on bankrolls are good, but can be found in all his books."
2,disappointing,"Being a Lene Lovich fan, I was very disappointed in this release. I've listened to it several times, and it just doesn't come together for me. It starts with a decent drum beat, but at it's best (I could be you mix), it sounds more like someone turned the recorder on and everyone just goofed around in the studio. While there has always been a quirky quality to her work, there has also been a strong song structure and pop sensibility mixed with her eccentricity. I'm hoping we won't have to wait another 10 years + for a new release, but on the next one I'm hoping for something as strong as her last album, March. There just didn't seem to be enough Lene on this release."
2,REALLY SMALL,"The pictures make it look so much bigger than it really is. It isn't big enough to laminate an 8x10 piece of paper. It looks like its more for pictures or small things. My husband was so disappointed, we'll probably end up selling the thing without using it, because he needed one for normal-sized papers. Very disappointed. Lesson learned that we'll get the measurements and not go off of price the next time we buy something."
4,"love it, but caution","I love this book, however I bought it for my 10 year old niece and I think I'll hold on to it for a few more years. Dahl is my favorite children's author but he uses the word Hell and Slut in one of the poems, leading me to believe this book may not be entirely appropriate for my niece at this time. The poems are fantastic and perfectly worded, my absolute favorites being Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs. I wouldn't want her to bring this book to school and kids make a big deal about the ""bad words"". Maybe when shes 13 or 14. GREAT BOOK though."
1,No redeeming features.,"I am normally a huge Roald Dahl fan, and made the mistake of popping this one on for my kids without listening to it first. It is crass and gory with no redeeming cleverness or insight. It uses the word ""[...]"" once and ""hell"" twice. Cinderella's prince lops off the heads of the ungly stepsisters and we get a nice description of them bouncing and rolling around on the floor. In Jack and the Beanstalk, Jack's mother is crunched up and eaten by the giant. The moral of Snow White is ""gambling isn't a sin, providing that you always win"". Red Riding Hood packs a pistol, shooting the Big Bad Wolf. She also shoots the wolf lurking around the third Little Pig's house, and goes on to kill the pig as well. If you want clever fairtale re-writes, stick with ""Ever After"" or ""Ella Enchanted""!"
4,reversible sparring vest,This was bought as a birthday gift for my Grandson that does Tae Kwon Do. We have seen different types but this one is the best that we have seen or used. It is well worth the price. The only things is there was no way to track it once shipped and it was late getting here.
3,Not what I expected...,"I was expecting a historical novel about the three Bronte sisters, and although a completely rivetting tale, and well written, it is NOT historical fiction. I was disappointed to find out at the end of the novel that it is 100% fiction, and these characters did not exist. I guess I expected more of an embellishment of history, and not 100% fiction. The sisters NEVER were on Coldwater, their father was never a warden, and their brother did not die when they were younger.I enjoyed the fiction, I enjoyed the story and it was very suspenseful. I thought I was ""learning"" about the Bronte sisters in Coldwater, but actually, the author was using the Bronte sisters within her book."
5,"Half Man Half Amazing, that's what Paul Wright is","he's more then whicked tight, he's got the answer to your musical blisse. This guy can do love songs about girls, love songs about flip flops, but most of all his love songs about God, and explaining God's love for us, ""YOur Love Never Changes"" prolly an over played song, but it's always good to hear. Songs like ""who is this woman"" stay in your head weeks after hearing it...I've become attached to the music of Paul Wright...never understanding the feelings of a child whose parents are divorced, he sings a song called ""Mommy, where is daddy?"" a terrific song. ""west coast kid"" is also another song that's amazing it just is soooo catchy! buy the CD support Mr. Wright, and continue to enjoy the music God wants to hear, and wants you to hear :-D God Bless,BUKE!"
2,a full size short in the footbed,"there are nice shoes but,if you buy your correct size...the back of your foot will hang off.the suede is decent quality and the rubber soles are VERY well made..but,as the footbed is molded at the backif they do not fit the bottom of your foot exactly..you will not be able to wear them."
5,Was exactly what I expected,"The correct product showed up very quickly. It is easy to use, and kind of cute.Just make sure that before you punch holes into your business cards, that some of the information you need isn't written low and therefore in the path of the hole-puncher. That's an issue with the business card(s), not the hole puncher though.I would recommend this product.Rolodex One-Sheet Business Card 2-Hole Punch for 2.25 x 4 Inches Card Files, Plastic, Black (67699)"
3,Meandering Fantasy with Typical Faults,"Although at times wonderful, Gentle's ""Rats & Gargoyles"" is rife with excessive characters, some of whom are likeable but undeserving of a storyline, stupid jokes, elongated chapters and a pregnant pause of a final climax. Essentially the book is a hundred pages longer than it should be (I found myself dozing off at the 400 page mark), with chapters that are so drawn out that skipping entire sections is a really tempting idea. Some of the ideas are novel though, and that is finally what redeems the work as a whole. The use of magic as a decendant of Paracelsus and Agrippa is a welcome change to the typical ""high sorcery""; Rats are a nice change from those bloody elves; and the disceet history of the text is nicely portrayed. It's worth reading, if you're up for some fantasy and a long read."
3,not sure,Not sure if i gave the product time enough to work. I gae it a month and didn't see any changes.

5,We Could be Heroes,"Grand, Operatic, and Elegiac! Visconti is at his best enlivening the historical, with his attention to every detail. Shot on location, the narrative structure wonderfully paces the rule of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Helmut Berger infuses his portrayal with ambiguity, further heightened by nascent homosexuality: Is he mad or a genius? This idealistic Moon King is not a ruler for a united German republic. Associations with the feminine and embryonic state abound. With twitching hands and shifting eyes, Ludwig's mannerisms alone chart his retreat to a world of fantasy. This film must be seen in its complete, unexpurgated version to appreciate the artistry. Truly Royal!"
4,Ludwig -,We really enjoyed the movie - even at the very slow pace of the director! A really good feeling of the history of that time and his process and growth in his role as King (Mad King Ludwig). Visionaries are not such practical people!!
5,"Single Entry Ledger Book - hard to find, great experience","When my usual supply stores did not have this type of ledger that some people would say is antiquated, I found it on Amazon.com at a great price. Received very quickly."
4,The Thunderpuss team does it once again...,"Thunderpuss (Barry Harris & Chris Cox) is an unstoppable team. They club hits just keep coming and are taking over the dance floors. You will be wailing along to this song after hearing it a few times and begin catching on to the fun lyrics. As goes for all songs where Thunderpuss is involved, you won't be disappointed in getting your hands on this one. Another great hit. There are a total of 8 tracks on this cd. The listing is as follows: ""We can get there"" 1 - (TP2K Hot Radio Mix), 2 - (Almighty Radio Mix), 3 - (TP2K Club Radio Mix), 4 - (Almighty Anthem Radio Mix), 5 - (Thunderpuss 2000 Club Mix), 6 - (Almighty Extended Mix), 7 - (Thunder Dub), 8 - (Bonus Beats of Thunderpuss)... Great song. It's worth it!"
1,i would give it half a star if icould,i hate this woman singing. she becomes cloying and annoying after 5 minutes.i cant take it.
1,one star is too much for this bull. HORRID,"shes cheats when she sings , she goes into a falsetto and cant make it so she falls back in her head voice. she does many things to cheat to make a note. but celine is always genuine and never cheats. barbra should leave the scene - permanently."
4,Candle Alternative,The day after I received this product our power went out. It worked very well and safe. I have used it outdoors and it was nice not to worry about the flame blowing out. Very realistic. As described. The only reason for the 4 stars is it is tricky to turn on.
2,Zipper broke,I bought this for my 10 year old son as a backpack for school. The only thing he keeps in his backpack is a small 3 ring binder and occasionally he'll shove his sweatshirt in it. There are 2 zippers on the big main pocket and within the first 3 weeks of school the zipper broke. I don't have much use for a backpack that won't close. Won't be buying another K-Cliffs backpack.
3,betwixt and between,"I felt like the author tried to walk a line between mystery and farce and didn't succeed. The main character was likable and realistic. Some of the minor characters seemed like stock players from a parody of Texas or the eastern mob. Caricatures are supposed to give comic relief by creating havoc, however the havoc caused by some of these characters was quite serious and not comic. It just felt out of balance.Other than that, not a bad read."
3,A Nice Read,"Do not take the 3 star rating as a slam (there are entirely to many 5 star ratings on Amazon), I really enjoyed the book. This was the first book I had read by Ben Rehder and I found out, after the fact, that this was the second book using these characters and location. You couldn't tell. Mr. Rehder did an excellent job introducing John Marlin, the county game warden and all around good guy. The same can be said for setting up the background of the story. I did not feel a lack of detail that sometimes occur during a second book.A couple of the characters were caricatures of their ethnicity. For example, Inga from Minnesota was a tall blond Norwegian (to Mr Rehder's credit he did not have her say ""Ya hey der""). Sal Manelli, the Italian from New York spoke like My Cousin Vinny. But I did not find this off-putting at all.I enjoyed the book enough that I have no qualms about purchasing Buck Fever."
4,Bone Dry,His sense of humor keeps one rolling along with the mystery. I enjoyed it... easy reading! I recommend it for a enjoyable read!
3,so-so,"It jumped around too much, too hard to keep up with characters, but was easy to read and a little love interest."
4,Hit or miss...,"Definitely the best vegan jerky I've had... now - all of them aren't that awesome. The spicy one is great, and the cowgirl or whatever, that one is delicious... the other two are a little questionable... but hey - you get to try all of 'em. I ended up placing more orders from the manufacturer's website directly because you can get larger quantities of specific recipes."
1,Disappointed,"I also purchased this item believing it was for children ages 4 and up, as clearly stated in the description. It is NOT!! It is clearly a Toddler's helmet and pad set, when you receive it is written on the box Toddler. The helmet and pads are small, obviously for a toddler. I also had to return it, and as a matter of fact, am still waiting to be credited for it. Amazon should change the description of this item to state Toddler, so it won't be so misleading. This might be fine for a toddler, but do NOT purchase this if the child is older than about 3!!"
1,TOO SMALL!!!,"I was really excited to give this to my son for his third birthday with his first bike. Unfortunately, it was too small for his head. He is a little big for his age, but his head is not oversized. No way is this for ""ages 4 and up."""
1,For TODDLERS only!,"I ordered this for my 8 year old grandson to use with a razor scooter. I totally relied on the information provided on the website recommending it for ages 6 - 12 yrs. My grandson is thin and average build, so I was sure it would fit. He could not even get the pads on! It would probably fit a normal size two year old."
1,Yuck! Scummy Ice!,"I bought these trays about a year ago. I got them in blue, yellow, red and purple. I like the ice cubes and they are easy to use, but I can only use the blue and yellow ones. My red and purple trays cause the cubes to make a film of scum on the surface of my drinks, especially carbonated drinks. I have washed them every way I can think of, dishwasher, soaking etc. At this point, I don't know what to do, so I just keep making and dumping out the ice in them hoping that eventually the scum will stop. It hasn't yet. It is too bad because otherwise I would have really liked these trays."
5,Great Toothpaste!,I love this toothpaste. It is the only one I've found that seems to help with tea/pop stains. Seems to be harder to find in stores. Very happy to find it available on Amazon! Thank you!
1,fell apart,"This is a very pretty instrument, but it fell apart. I couldn't tighten the strings (even with musicians help). Very disappointed."
2,mmm,"this is a completely subjetive review,be aware,my problem with this novel is that I don't think I can like any of the characters like I did with the outsiders,they didn't catch my interest at all,and I find tex anoying in a way...that and personally I didn't feel the story was going anywhere for most of it until the car conflict happen."
5,Classic Willard,John Ortberg says there is no one like Dallas Willard when it comes to expressing the deep truths associated with pursuing Spiritual Disciplines. He's right. This modern classic is one I reference again and again.There really is nothing quite like Willard's profound insights on this topic. He's the best.
4,Moreland Lucky Ghost,"While not the best of his films I have seen, this was still enjoyable to watch.Lucky Ghost [Slim Case]"
1,Didn't work for me.,I was skeptical when I bought this device but decided I would give it a try. The majority of our mouse problems existed in our garage which is where I installed the device.I don't know if this is a coincidence or what but we actually had more mice in our garage while the device was plugged in. It seemed to attract them instead of repel them. I got fed up and unplugged the device and our mouse problem has dropped off quite a bit. I know from the majority of reviews that this device must work for some people but ours is getting returned to the store.
1,It does not work for squirrels,"Squirrels are not gone. Seems they are visiting less then before installation of the device, but they are not gone at all."
4,Pestacator seems to work,"My 3 roommates and I had been sharing our large apartment w/a rapidly growing family of mice. After the catch-and-release traps I had proved utterly ineffective I reluctantly bought this product. I'd been looking at it for weeks; had read positive reviews of it, and the hardware store employees said they hadn't had any complaints about it. Fortunately it was on sale when I'd finally had enough of the mice and was willing to shell out the cash. The man at the hardware store had told me it would take up to a couple weeks for it to be fully effective, that it might increase activity in the first couple days, and that you have to unplug it every so often so they don't get used to it or settle in again.I have not seen a single mouse in a couple of weeks now, nor fresh droppings. This is a huge improvement. Even at $15 off the regular price this wasn't easy on a college student budget, but I still have to say it was worth it."
1,Pestacator 2000,This product is crap......a scam. I used this for over 2 yearsPest A Cator 2000 Electromagnetic Rodent Repeller For Larger AreasI thought it was working but started hearing noises in wall. I decided to set traps and caught an unbelievable amount of mice. I tried replacing the one I was using...thinking it might be defective..... Same results. If you want to get rid of mice use the old standard snap trap and use peanut butter for bait. I find the Victory traps work the best. Good luck!
1,Pretty ordinary,"Nothing special here, run of the mill type overated drivel, nothing new, typical i suppose"
2,"Good music, but wait a second","What we have here is a slick repackaging for Johnny Rodriguez's release from the early 1990's titled ""Run for the Boarder."" None of the songs here are the orginal hit recordings. While some of the songs have never been recorded before, the big named songs here are totally remakes.Now they are excellent remakes, and the new songs are excellent. But it gets a low rating simply because it is a cheap lie. Tryin to steal the money of country fans who aren't properly educated in the art of picking out good collections."
2,misleading picture,"a bit bummed by this product actually. By the look of the picture I expected to get 5 times as many blocks. Now that I have it, it's clear that there were at least 4 packs of blocks used in this picture.also, the blocks aren't cut well, the edges are scalloped/warped on many edges making stacking particularly difficult. I mean, they're blocks, you don't need to get that much right to be good.average."
2,Rudimentary at best.,"The DeMarises cover electrical consumption, battery basics, some alternative energy sources, and hauling out the sewage. It's a short quick read. No treatment of offroad driving or RV operations, selecting (and avoiding) campsites, running a low impact campsite, basic equipment for rv boondocking (shovel, axe, rope, tow strap, etc.) or any of the other many ""boondocking"" topics which spring to my mind. This is money easily saved."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but this didn't work on my carpet at all. It bounced along the top of the nap without collecting more than a few hairs. Pushing was no more successful than pulling. I followed up with my little Bissell Swift Sweep which picked up wads of hair from the same area I just brushed with this product."
3,Very handy for pet owners,"The FURemover broom works really well on hard floors, just okay on carpet. I use the squeegee side on my kitchen/dining room floors. The hair doesn't fly around like it does with a broom. It doesn't fit into corners or along the wall, so it's hard to get the carpet that really collects the hair. The head comes off if you push hard while using on carpet. Unfortunately, you really need to push hard or you don't get as much hair up. I prefer my petmate pet hair magnet for carpet, having both of these tools is a good idea."
1,"So promising, but a disappointment","This is a product that's better as an idea than a real thing.Does it pick up pet hair? Yes.Better than many other brooms or mops? Maybe.But ... does it make cleaning up easier? No.If the head swiveled, it would be SO much easier to use.Also, the whole thing is of flimsy construction. There's a plastic cap at the end of the handle designed to allow for hanging the broom, but it's badly designed and won't stay on the broom. I feel like the whole thing is about to fall apart every time I use it.The whole thing feels cheap and as though no one who designed it ever used it.I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
3,It really doesn't do what I bought it for....,"I was really hoping for a broom that would also take care of dirt and sand...which this doesn't. When my floors are dirty I have a combination of things to remove, not just hair."
1,disappointed,"I receive a ""sweepa"" knock-off. same function but Not a Sweepa Original.does an adequate job but Was Definitely Not What is Advertised nor What I Expected."
3,Not what I hoped for but ok,"I was hoping this would be the miracle tool that I have been searching for to get rid of dog hair fast but its not. There is a lot of effort involved in using this product on carpet/rugs/furniture. It works great on hardwood floors and tile, better than chasing dog hair with a broom. I am keeping it, but If i would have known it wasn't going to work on fabrics, i would not have purchased it."
5,Baseplate a MUST,"If you're going to buy that big tub of Duplo blocks, then you've gotta get this baseplate. It's a foundation for all the neat castles, towers, and other amazing creations your kid's gonna make with all of those blocks. In case you haven't guessed, mommy likes playing with it too."
4,Building plate,The product works well and makes the Duplo the kids build more sturdy than it was without it. Glad we got it.
4,"Great, but the wrong size","When shopping for legos there are many to choose from. The building plates are a hit, but this one is for larger legos, not tiny legos, as my five-year-old fondly calls them. Pay close attend to detail if you are looking for a specific size. : )"
4,Bigger than I thought.,Works great with all the duplo blocks. Arrived promptly and is just the right size for the bigger blocks for the younger ones.
1,Disappointing to say the least,"Variable quality recordings, some quite poor. I was very disappointed with this collection. Even though I'm a JW fan, I sold the CD."
2,recommended for people just getting into vampire books,"Night Ecstasy:Was okay in the start but the ""insect bite"" and the ""magic pill"" just wrecked it for me. I did like seeing the soft side of a 300 year old vampire, though.Velvet Night:How is it okay to sneak into someone's bedroom when they're asleep and do ""stuff"" to them? And then the girl falls in love with this perv? I liked how he never lied to her and told her he was a vampire.Midnight Court:The twist at the end was really good but the whole story was a little too vague for me.This book can be a good beginning for someone just starting to read Vampire novels. For readers of Anita Blake or Sookie Stackhouse novels, it is almost too vanilla!"
3,I didn't get it!,"I read the last story, Midnight Court twice and still don't understand it! Who was the ""angel"" and why was she locked up for so long? Who is Elizabeth? Why didn't we ever see Alan? If Dante has been intimate with Elizabeth before, why has he never had her blood? What had Alan done to Elizabeth's feet? Sorry, I've read over 1000 romances, including many paranormal, and I've never been so confused. Otherwise - ok stories, but NONE of these men should be considered Bad Boys!"
2,Golden Retriever,I bought an extra large for my 80lb male golden retriever and it is too short in the body. I don't think they make an XXL.
5,great for young teens,This is a perfect cd for young teens . to begin their interest in classical music. Thank Tou Twilight.
5,Awesome Music,Debussy's work collected here is beautiful! Thank you for a great experience I can keep repeating.
2,Cold cuts,"2 1/2The post-rock group's sophomore output nestles a comfortable midground between the pummeling straightforwardness of Mogwai and the production aesthetics of Tortoise, though manages to sound simultaneously vacant and indulgent by providing a sound that is heavy on atmosphere and light on structure, ultimately exposing its simplicities in constant repetition."
3,MAP,I purchased this map for my brother who recently moved to Queens New York. Although it's usable I didn't realize the map was several years old. It was in good condition and my brother is using it.
3,A new noir type of tale.,"Tres is the kind of Noir hero I enjoy. His remarks to others make you cringe, but you enjoy him saying them. Sassy isn't the word for it, more like self-destruction, but somehow he comes out the other side of a beating. I've never been to San Antonio, but I felt as though I was there in the middle of the heat through Riordan's descriptions. I enjoyed this mystery right through to the end, and I didn't see it coming until the appropriate moment, but didn't feel cheated of clues at the end, either. Though not to be kept on the shelves forever, like Sayers or Stout, I will certainly look for more of Rick Riordan's mysteries. This was a fun read, more foul language than I enjoy, probably less than most people are used to these days. I also appreciated the way he described his hero's more intimate moments. Enough that I knew they were there, but I didn't feel like a voyeur after reading about it."
5,"An Intense, Emotionally Gripping Look At Poverty","Sebastiao Salgado has earned numerous accolades for his dignified photographs of impoverished humanity. This, his latest book, covers work he has done over the last few years, documenting forced migrations and economic squalor throughout the world. He is certainly a keen observer of the human condition. However, I felt completely overwhelmed looking at his work from this book when it was exhibited a few months ago at New York City's International Center of Photography. Looking at this book allowed me to step back, and catch my breath, studying each image at my leisure. Those interested in looking at some of the finest current work in black and white documentary photography will not be disappointed with this excellent collection."
2,Ignorance is not bliss,"There are two parts of this book. In the first part, our heroine, Olivia, is so ignorant that she makes herself miserable. In the second part, she's so dumb and angry that she makes herself miserable. I spent the better part of the book wanting to do something that would make her wake up - figuratively. It doesn't help that I found Spencer to be a self-centered unsympathetic character. Somehow, his noble misery just annoyed me.I'm bummed I didn't like this book. The Door County setting held a great deal of promise.In fairness, someone out there liked this book. It won a Reviewer's Choice award from Romantic Times. It was also garnered a five star review in The Romance Reader. Obviously, there are different tastes out there (and I'll admit that Americana doesn't usually do much for me)."
5,One of the Most Comprehensive Throwing Manuals Available,"""The Throws Manual"", coauthored by Kevin McGill and George Dunn, Jr. covers all of the throwing events in splendid detail. It has a different section for every throwing event that covers everything from the basics to a faults and corrections of the throws. The book also contains a great section about training, which goes into great detail about the various methods of training for the throws, such as pylometrics and the Olympic lift. This book should definitely be put in every serious throwers library!"
3,What are you doing to particpate?,"Another Rawkin side project of the prolific Tim Kerr (Poison 13, Big Boys, King Sound Quartet, Lord High Fixers), this another blend of punk, funk and soul. The opening instrumental ""The Hard Sell"" is an organ driven ... shaking, fist pumping number that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Kerr's bandmate from the Poison 13 days, Mike Carroll lends his gritty vocals adding a rough punk rock edge. Fans of Kerr's other work will not be disappointed."
3,3.5 stars,"This 2002 recording by Sweden's Kaipa is somewhat misleading in that the only two Kaipa members present are the Flower Kings' Roine Stolt and keyboardist, composer, Hans Lundin. Bassist Jonas Reingold, also of the Flower Kings, is present as well. Carrying on in Kaipa tradition is the use of absolutely horrid vocalists. The majority of the singing here is by Patrick Lundstrom. This guy over-emotes at every turn. He comes across more like a refugee from a bad Andrew Lloyd Weber production (is there any other kind). He really spoils things but doesn't manage to ruin them. The two female vocalists (one cut each) are no better. The compositions and musicianship are terrific but it is no small task getting past the vocals and embarrasingly weak lyrics. Thankfully there are a number of instrumental cuts. Proceed with caution...Simon"
5,Amazingly Awesome!,"Lions and Hyenas is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its drama and excitement make for a movie that is exciting from start to finish. Powers Boothe's narration adds to the intrigue of Motsumi, Mondavu, and Antwondamala the lion stars of the film. Amazing footage of three lion cubs being born and the love of a young mother. You'll watch the hyena's torment the lions all day and night. The matriarch and the downfall of her princess. This movie is the best!!"
4,My Little Pony and Friends,"I love this book, not only cause i love My Little POny, but the pictures are great and I grew up loving them. It brings me back to when I was little and watching the tv show and playing with my toys.I will keep my memory alive."
2,A good reason that these weren't released,"I am one of the biggest ""Dan"" fans on the planet from way way back. There is a reason this material wasn't released. It sounds like what it is...demo tapes.Anything from Can't Buy a Thrill on is way better than any of these.If you are a hardcore, I mean really hardcore, Dan fan this probably is a must have. It doesn't warrant more than one or two listens and it's old hat."
4,Joint issues,"Glucosamine/chondroitin has been found to get into joints in studies, and the combo has become adjusted over time. I take this with Hyaluronic acid and cherry juice."
5,Graniteware Roaster,"I gave it as a gift, she loved it since the granite roaster she had for over 20 years had gotten a small hole in the bottom from so much use."
3,okay roaster,Roaster is nice but finish is already coming off under lid where handle is attached. Kind of disappointed since only had this for about a month.
1,NOT LED LIGHTS,WE ORDERED THIS TREE IN JANUARY. OPENED LAST WEEK IN NOVEMBER. THE LIGHTS ARE NOT LED AS ORIGINALLY ADVERTISED. THEY ARE THE REGULAR INCANDESCENT MINI LIGHTS. AMAZON JUST TODAY CHANGED THE DESCRIPTION TO MINI LIGHTS TODAY AFTER COMPLAINT BUT IS UNWILLING TO REPLACE THE TREES ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS LED TREES.
4,GKI Bethlehem Lighted Tree,"The tree arrived in just a couple of days. It was difficult for me to put the bottom two pieces on by myself because of their weight. But, with two of us, no problem. The tree (even without decorations) was beautiful. Love the two differnt kinds of lights and the pine cones add a nice touch. I would buy it again."
2,Small for RG59 cable,Purchased numerous different cable clips for some long cable runs to install a security camera system. These cable clips crush the wiring slightly and the nails are so short they are difficult to install. I would not buy them again.
2,Shame...,"I bought this light with great expectations - the reviews were good, etc. We got it and it was great - great light output, attached easily, however, it did not last. After just 6 months of use it died, and Brookstone would not replace or refund my money. I think $50 is a lot to spend on an item that will end up in a landfill 6 month after purchase - it's a shame."
3,Fills in many blanks in Cold War history,"This book and others like it fill in the gaps in the record of the Cold War. I find it fascinating, for example, that pre-war Soviet spies were driven mostly by ideology, while those in the post war era were driven by cash. The book itself can be dry at times, but it is a complete treatment of the subject. I also read 'The Sword and The Shield, The Mitrokin Archive' by Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokin and found that the two books correlate closely. Very informative about a time in history I have lived through."
2,Problems with the book,"I read this book with interest, and then read a review that made me realize that Haynes and Klehr may have played a little fast and loose with some facts themselves. For example (taken from the review by Walter and Meriem Schnier), ""when parts of Bentley's story are shown to be consistent with Venona, they are prepared to declare without any qualification that 'Elizabeth Bentley had told the truth.' They overlook the fact that the decoders of Venona used names and incidents from the FBI files to help make identifications and fill gaps - the very names and incidents that were often supplied in the first place by Chambers and Bentley."" Their review, which can be found online ...doscuments numerous instances of sloppy interpretations and selective omission of facts. I suggest that prospective readers of this book read the full review for other examples of problems with the book's handling of material from Venona."
3,Decent for the price,"The glove is basically what you are paying for. It is a $5 glove and lasted about 2 rounds of golf. Granted, I do not take the glove off when I play, so it may last longer for some. The threads have started to come out and it already has a hole in the index finger. However, the sizing was fine. Ordered a XL and it fit me fine."
2,Intech glove,Although it was advertised and shipped as an XL it did not fit as an XL.It was too small vs other XL's I've worn in the past.
3,Good gloves but starting to fray already,"Looks really good but the glove is starting to fray already after two visits to the driving range. Maybe I'm being too rough on it, but I hoped for better, even at the low price."
2,Too Small,I ordered a left handed X-Large regular (not cadet)and it is entirely too small. I know this is a cheap glove and I was not expecting much but the skimpy size makes it unusable.I won't order these again.
1,"Terrible, unless you like blisters",There is nothing redeeming about these gloves. I got blisters on both hands and the glove fell apart after a few uses.
2,No luck for lefties,"Can you guys improve on the description of the golf gloves. I am a left-handed player and am stuck with 2 gloves that is on the left-hand.Reading other comments from reviewers, I think you guys only sell gloves for right-handed players. No matter which orientation we order, you guys just give us the left hand gloves.You guys get it right 95 times out of 100, what about the other 5 like me :("
4,Tina Rocks!,"I've heard a lot of J-pop, having spent 12 years in Tokyo. Most of it is weak and derivative. Tina may be somewhat derivative, but this woman can sing. Try ""I can't take it,"" ""Magic,"" and ""Spend the Time"" - better than most of the American R&B/Soul that they echo. There are an awful lot of overproduced pretty faces in Japanese music - pass them over and start your J-soul collection with Tina!"
5,A POWERFUL LOOK AT BIBLICAL FASTING!,"Not only has the information in this powerful book been instrumental in my own spiritual development (bondage breaking!), the companion Study Guide was most helpful when leading this study for others. EVERYONE was blessed and deeply moved by finally understanding what it meant to incorporate Biblical Fasting into their Christian life. Thank you, Mr. Towns!This book is designed to target a biblical and spiritual understanding of this Christian discipline rather than give tips on fasting; however, in Towns book, ""The Beginner's Guide to Fasting"", he writes more about the physical aspects of undergoing a fast. I recommend this book for a more thorough knowledge of ""how to"" fast and what to expect physically. May God bless you as He has blessed me!"
2,Has a Dripper not a Stopper,"Great heat retention but the stopper leaks.Great for around the house where the bottle is likely to remain upright, but not so good if you need something to put in a briefcase and carry to work."
1,leaks-not covered by company,"I love my coffee pot by Zojirushi so when my sister offered to purchase a new thermos to replace my old and beaten small thermos, I suggested Zojirushi tuff slim. Mistake. It is less than a week old and the button leaks after one usage which means when I open the top cup, the liquid that leaked is now on me and the floor and everything in-between. The company has now twice responded to email that it will only replace if the thermos is not keeping liquids warm. The person who responded told me to keep the thermos in upright position. ?-it's a thermos for travel. It offers me the directions to 'correctly' clean the button because that is the reason it leaks;I didn't take the assembly apart prior to using so it came defective and will be thrown away defective. My beaten, battered, mis-shapened 12-old thermos of same style/design (not brand) leaks less than the Zojirushi new one even when tossed into the bottom of my travel bag and keeps liquids just as warm."
5,lots of fun,"Although this book was written in the 19th century it moves in a breezy and modern pace. It reminds me of ""To say nothing of the dog"" which was written in the current area as a send up of Victorian life and sensibilities. Anyone who enjoys reading about the Victorians will like this innocent and fast moving romance."
1,Utterly awful!,This fax machine is a terrible product and proof that buying something on the cheap is a bad idea. I've had this fax machine for three years and utterly hate it. If I wasn't so broke I'd buy something else.
1,Look for a better model,"I purchased this product because I was looking for an inexpensive battery back up/surge protector. When I received it, the entire box was printed in spanish - I wasn't even sure what I had. I opened the box and the directions - thankfully - were in English. Unfortunately, the unit did not work from the start. The battery would not hold a charge. I contacted the manufacturer, APC, which was what the information inside said to do. They were very helpful, and told me that this unit was not even manufactured anymore, and they replaced it with a newer model, which worked. All in all, I faired OK, but I would not purchase this particular model. I would, however, purchase a product from APC - they were great!"
2,A below average game....,"Just looking at the title, you know this game is going to be, at best, Mediocre.4 Lives, no continues. So while the game is easy, 4 mistakes, and it's gameover.You can get points by walking past various objects, getting clocks, jumping on picnic baskets, and going through bonus stages (Where you collect a piece of a clock, 1 for each stage in the area.), yet these points do nothing.The foreground can get in the way, and block pits, enemies, and other hazards from view.Finally, you can't see below you, so if you take an upper path, and see it's a dead end, jumping down to find the right path may lead you to your death. (Main reason why I said it's easy to die.)So, what's good about this game? The music. The music is the only thing the 4 people that made this game got right. It's not fantastic, but it's actually good.If you must play it, get a ROM. Don't shell out the money to buy this trash."
4,A couple really tough scenes!,"This book will drag some, but it will grab your heart and squeeze it as well! Clare's story was really hard. I don't want to give any details because I don't want to ruin any of her story, but let me tell you it's a tear jerker! The most tear-jerking part of the story was her weekend trip back er KC! WOW...And it ends really, really romantic!!!I really enjoyed reading the bonding of father and daughter as well. I'm happy it all turned out okay...You'll love the last chapter! It was GREAT! I think there could have been more romance and thoughts on their feelings for each other. It seemed to be secondary to the story and it seemed to take forever to get to it..."
1,Be warned: quantity 4=4 quarts (1 gallon for nearly the price of 4 gal.),"Take it from me, read the listing carefully for these ""quantity 4"" listings. At first glance, you might think that you're ordering 4 gallons at a slight discount to the building supply store price, instead, you are ordering 4 quarts=1 gallon, for nearly the price of 4 gallons at the local store. Pass these listings by, buy locally. You'll be very glad you did."
4,NOT A SLOW COOKER!,"You've already read it in another review but it needs to be said again, ITS NOT A SLOW COOKER!!! Coleman should take that off the box period...That being said, after I threw out the first stew I simply paid alot more attention to the next one and it worked perfectly. Just know that this is a heat and serve unit. Pre-cook the food and use this to heat it up.If I can I'm going to fabricate a heat shield between the burner and the pan to eliminate some of the issue as well."
4,Windows XP Pocket Reference,"This is a great little reference book, but a little too technical for me.As I get more proficient with this computer it will become more useful.One never stops learning, a new short cut, a new activity, etc. I have a few friends, a lot cleverer than me, that may get to borrow it, but never will they keep it."
1,LOUD!!!!,"""Quiet and cool: An efficient convection cooling system and a thermostatically controlled fan keep this unit reliably cool and remarkably quiet."" NOT!After twenty minutes, you will think you have a hair dryer and a vacuum cleaner on your desk. It also prevents my Kensington mouse from working.DON'T buy it!Mine is going back ASAP."
2,wow that is very very very loud,"I have never written a review for any product in my life. But I felt that it is important for this one. The fan is unbelievable. It is like having a small very frustrated vacuum cleaner on all the time. I was so amped to expand my storage in a single unit. Moses Jesus Mohammed Buddha and Chango this is loud. I am trying to work with it next to me I have music on fairly loud and it makes no difference. Actually it makes it worse. It is not a serene hum, or a neutral sound in any way. It is a very imposing and damaging machine. It is like a frightening science project in an insane asylum. More like an airplane or an industrial processor than something that one reads and writes next to. It is clear that this machine will create problems for me. I can hear it from outside my house."
4,One Terabyte External Hard Drive,"Sure is louder than I'd like - my wife as well - but the idea of having 20 years of collected computer files in one place is really appealing. Plenty fast. Sleek design. Lots of options - and all the correct cables. Had a problem during installation that was quickly fixed by calling WD support people - the drive was not ""initialized,"" which took about three hours to accomplish."
2,Should have included earplugs...,Their 500 GB model is excellent. This model has all the same great features but is loud enough to be annoying. It is a great back up option for infrequent use. For daily use I would look elsewhere. I regret this noisy purchase.
1,"Winey, LOUD & VERY NOISEY","This drive is great! Partitioned it 750Gb for Vista on Mac Book Pro and 250Gb for Mac OSX backups. Zips along through firewire 800 . . . super!BUT . . . its too LOUD. After 10 minutes I want to take poison! The frequency of the fan is enough to resonate the ear drum.SO . . I have to return it! Darn, I like it so much. I rate this product as a 1/10. If it were not for the fan . . . 10/10."
3,So loud that I can't hear myself think!,"The main issue is the decibel level of the machine. It has a fan which at low rpm is tolerable, but quickly will rev up to the point that you don't want to be around the thing. Unless you have it situated in a place where sound is not an issue, then go ahead and purchase it. Otherwise, the drive does what it is designed to do and is a good value for its specs."
4,"A little noisy, but works well","This is the second WD external drive I purchased (the first was a 400 GB My Book). I use it to back up my computer data.Good points:- large capacity- worked out of the box, no problems after 6 months of use (so far, so good!)- accepts 100-240V input, so I could use it (in India) without an adaptorBad points:- noisy, especially on startup- does not turn off when the computer is switched off, waste of electricityAll in all, a good product. I would definitely buy WD again."
1,Worthless garbage,"This thing won't run for more than 20 minutes before the fan comes on high speed, and VERY loud, and it shuts down. And this is when it is just sitting there with no activity. Avoid this piece of garbage."
5,Will last a lifetime,"I have had the 2TB version of this for 4 years, and I think other reviewers are a little harsh on the noise this thing makes. Yes, it makes noise, but no louder than any other white noise around the house or office. Aside from the noise, this has been the best external hard drive I have ever owned. While serving in the Army, it has been dropped, kicked, knocked down, stepped on, hit by a power surge, had numerous beverages and even some motor oil spilled on it, went to the field and overseas with me, filled with dust, dirt, and grime of every sort, and it's still kicking! I only wish I could find more of these to buy to meet my growing capacity needs. I DEFINITELY would recommend this hard drive to anyone looking for durability."
1,Do Not Buy This If Your Data is IMPORTANT!,"Our company purchased 12 of these units and over half of them have crashed already, or have lost one of the two drives, or have lost a power supply. These units are crap! We have lost much data! Do not use this if you are planning on keeping data ""Safe"". Fine for quick transfers on non-critical data. Use at your own risk! The units worked fine for about three months."
1,"Courage, romance and wildlife accuracy failed","The Horse Whisperer as an excellent study in human emotional wounds. But it left some to be desired in its accuracy on healing traumatized horses. The same is true, indeed more true with Evans second novel, The Loop. Except that now it extends to both humans as well as the animals. The characters are melodramatic. And the opening scene of a wolf stalking is as far from the true nature of a wolf as you can get. In fact it only serves to perpetuate the mythical nature of wolves that has made them erroneously dreaded and killed for centuries. I find little to merit this nove."
4,The Loop,"Not quite as good as The Horse Whisperer, but riveting in some parts. Actually, I read the ending, then went back to the middle of the book."
5,Loved it!!!!!!!,"I have yet to read the book, but I did listen to it. My family checked it out of the library, so we could listen to it on the way to Colorado. We started it in the early morning when we left, and finished it half way back to Arizona, where we started. It was a wonderful story. It entertained us the whole trip. It never got boring. I would suggest it to anyone who likes books that have a little love story, enemies, adventure, suspense, and friendship. It is a five star book all the way. I think it was a great story to listen to on the road, and is just as fun to listen to at home while trying to relax, or cook, or are on the computer, or are even reading another book."
2,"Boring, stereotypic characters","The protagonist (female) is suffering from rejection in an insipid romance, goes to wolf country to heal, discovers who is the big bad wolf (local powerful macho rancher) and falls in love with sensitive, stuttering son of the stereotypic bad guy. Boring, boring, boring. The BEST character in the whole book was the woman's dog."
3,Horse Whisperer still Evans' best work,"An enjoyable read, but the plot wasn't as well-developed as was the plot in 'Whisperer.' At times, I wondered what certain details were supposed to lead me to wonder, or believe, and some of those questions were unanswered at the conclusion of the book. Yet, Evans' is capable of telling a good story. I'd like to see more."
4,Gave me a good perspective of wolve reentry program.,Got my interest right away. I enjoy books on animals and the outdoors. The characters were interesting and believable. Had a hard time putting the book down. Would readily recommend this book to friends.
4,The next Jack London?,"After finishing THE LOOP this past weekend, I am at a loss of words to describe how wonderful this novel is. Nicholas Evans' storytelling has truly blossomed since THE HORSE WHISPERER and I can't wait for his next story.THE LOOP, the story of a band of wolves that attack the livestock of the fictional town of Hope, Montana, is filled with pure emotion, rich characters and beautiful descriptions. Not many authors can pull all three of these things together with as much ease as Evans has. Even the shocking (if somewhat unbelievable) love-interest between 29-year old Helen and 18-year old Luke is carried out with such craft that you often wonder why such a relationship is frowned upon by society. The only problem I found was with the author's antagonist, Buck, who is stylized after any number of Larry McMurtry characters, which isn't all that bad in my eyes."
2,Good environmentalism - indifferent writing,"I liked the movie ""The Horse Whisperer"" and this was my first Nicholas Evans book. The writing is terribly patchy. Evans is at his best when writing about wolves, when he is able to engage the reader with some semblance of expression - but just about. The rest of the time, his writing is turgid at worst and passable at best. The love story, its development is really infantile. In his defence, he writes better than Nicholas Sparks though that is not saying much. I anticipate that the movie version (if it gets made) will be watchable as it will allow the wide sweep of Montana and the main protoganists (the wolves) to appear to better effect."
3,The Loop,"While I enjoyed the developing relationship in the book, I did not enjoy the real truth of how wolves have been hunted and destroyed. It was a bit too graphic in making it's point. Nicholas Evans other books, The Smoke Jumper, The Horse Whisper, The Divide were 5 star so I was disappointed with this one."
4,"touching, question","I was reccomended this book by a swedish friend of mine. to my failings i must confess that i do not read very often but the Loop was captivating.i tried to find somewhere to e-mail amazon but i failed., i want to know, can i obtain copies of this book in other languages or is Amazon exclusively english. please excuse my spelling, i have problems.i would very much appreciate a reply, i am trying to get hold of a copy in Italian."
4,"Engrossing tale of wolves, family conflict, love and loyalty","I'm stunned by my fellow ""advance copy"" reader's opinion. I found THE LOOP far superior to the enjoyable but far too sacharine HORSE WHISPERER. Apart from simply being a light though thoroughly entertaining and engrossing story, I was fascinated by Evans' descriptions of wolves - their parenting and family life, their ""pecking order"" and hunting instincts. One scene describing the pack's hunt of a deer buck was simply palpable. I was also heartened to discover that though there is a ""love interest"" sub-plot to keep the story slightly saucy, Evans has managed to reduce the ""schmaltz factor"" which many (especially men) found difficult to handle in THE HORSE WHISPERER. THE LOOP is bound to be the lead holiday read and ""word-of-mouth"" book for the end of year publishing season here in Australia and in the U.S."
2,Unfulfilled promise.,"I wanted to love this book, but it never grabbed me, spiritually or emotionally. Very little character development, either in the people or the wolves. Nothing in the book made me care much about the people or wolves and what happened to them, and I am an animal lover! Strangely, I kept waiting for a physical description of the heroine so I could ""picture her"" in my mind, but it never came! Overall, I did not find much to recommend in this story."
4,"Excellent, Breathtaking","This is an excellent book, and as an animal lover who cannot stand to see animals in pain, I wanted the wolves to win from the start. I felt more compassion for the animals from the get go then I did for any of the characters. The scenery is described beautifully, as is the nature of life in the midwest. This book allows a reprieve from the daily grind. The main character is captivating, and this book offers a bit of everything -- love, adversity, and personal growth, as well as villians and heroes. Evans is a mesmerizing writer, with the ability to truly tell a story."
3,Capone info,"I verified info That is the Lexington.I had seen it up close myself.pg167 death date is correct,but mistaken on pg.170.It still a good read!I wouldn't go as far as being there!!!Truth about photos they are nice!"
3,No 5.1 due to Defective Gamelink 200,"Hello All,I had bought the Gamelink200 and Lightwave 100 expecting to get Digital Dolby from my Xbox. Unfortunately, all I was able to get to work was Surround sound. I just spoke with Monster Customer support and they confirmed that there was a bad batch of the Gamelink200 that prevents you from enbaling the Digital Dolby in the XBox menu. I am not sure if the Gamelink 300 and 400 are affected. Anyway, they offered to send me a replacement cable. It would be nice if that had posted this info on their Web site. BTW, according to them using the mini plug does not degrade the signal because they are going from electric digital to optical digitial. Can anyone confirm this? I will post an update once I get my new cables."
4,joseph- rickman,"Great book , and a great class on early American history. The book got here quickly and the information I learned was enjoyable."
2,Not a very good book for beginner OR advanced user,"I am very surprised at the positive reviews given to this book by others here. This is a very skimpy book which barely scratches the surface of the 32-bit Windows API. The writing style is also not very good, in my opinion. When I was first investigating the Win32 API, I bought this book, (possibly ironically attracted by its skimpiness), but that was a big mistake. Unless you intend to write a very simple, run-of-the mill text editor, or something along those lines, this book is not going to be a very good help. I GREATLY recommend Charles Petzold's book, which is better for the beginner (lots of background on how and why), AND the expert (Petzold's book contains ALL the gory details between its covers). If you love programming, you will have fun with Petzold's book, but you will become bored with this one, wondering why they left the meat out."
2,ok,"I like the looks of these ,however,they are too small for my son,s large pickup so they won't work. They aren,t big enough to fit cup holders."
3,007 Anime style,"If you are a spy drama fan and like cyborg super-spies, you should enjoy this anime. If you are looking for more sci-fi like anime, pass on it. The story line was good, but it's not really my style, so I've already given it away. (I'm not a Bond fan either). I won't spoil it any further."
1,Wasn't pleased,"I wasn't pleased with this video. I found it had a very lowbudget, which meant distant shots, unknown actors who really couldn'tact, and lighting that was atrocious. In addition, staging was bad,and you had trouble seeing who was talking. It also had nothing to dowith the Mark of the Beast, 666. It's about aleged conspiracy by thegovernment in UFO's. It's hard to follow and understand. I eventhought the video would be good since it's about alleged gov'tconspiracy, but the moderator whined a lot and spoke in a monotone andwhen scenes would show about something, they would only last a secondand then back to the moderator. Don't waste your money or time on thisvideo. YOU WILL REGRET IT if U do. END"
4,"""beautiful songs""","This CD is wonderful worship, listening, bring the presence God CD, and just down right beautiful to listen to. I look forward to hearing the others the Binions have to offer."
1,Ads and More Ads,"I should have bought Money 2003 in the first place. This ""redesign"" is a joke. The interface is pretty but doing almost anything takes twice the number of mouse clicks as did Quicken 2002. The ""improvement"" the customer will notice right away is that large Ads have been placed within some of the windows. And there is no way to turn the Ads off in the options menu. I was so disgusted with paying money to get a product that spammed me that I went out and bought Money 2003 Deluxe. Big improvement!! Money 2003 also has spamming ads but they can be turned off in the options menu. The program does everything Quicken 2003 does and has a more attractive interface."
1,Warning!,"Bootleg edition! It may say ""Region 1"" as the region coding but it's wrong. This 2 Disc Set is a bootleg edition!"
3,Nice Coffee Table Book,Great pictures. Thought it would be more informational but still an interesting read. Wish it was a hard cover because it would be a great coffee table book.
5,Labels,Product was as advertised and delivered sooner than promised. Packaging was sturdy and protected contents from damage. I will buy this again if I need waterproof labels. They worked great in the color laser printer. No jams.
5,"Avery weatherproof labels have best adhesive, good for plastic long-term storage","These weather-resistant labels are the best I have found for sticking onto PLASTIC storage bins or totes (such as Rubbermaid Roughtotes), for long-term storage. Other labels quickly come loose. I have had especially bad luck with store brands. Now I only use the weatherproof line of labels from Avery when I need to label plastic items. I also use these for labeling packages to be mailed, because who knows what kind of weather a package will encounter during travel.I often just write on the labels, with a Sharpie permanent marker, rather than preparing printed labels. They seem to absorb the marker ink without smearing. Using the printer also works fine.Confusion Alert: The photo for this item may show a DIFFERENT SIZE of labels than what the text description indicates."
2,accomplished yet unappetizing,"I've heard Marc Cary perform live, and I know he's wonderful: a soulful player with chops.Trillium, however, flowers to life exactly once. Marc plays an Abbey Lincoln song My Love is You; it's the only work that's emotionally and aesthetically engaging. The other songs aren't dishonest --I just didn't like them. The somber piece with the burnished sounding flute could almost be effective if it weren't so repetitive.Cary's strengths as a pianist are more in the poet-painter mode of Tommy Flanagan, Bill Evans than say the cooker, burner types. For most of Trillium, he seems determined to play against the aspects of his style that I've enjoyed elsewhere, and thus, this cd just doesn't ""work for me,"" as they say in Latte Land."
4,Great Color,"This is the best printer I've ever used for printing photographs. It replaced and HP Photosmart and is much faster and better color rendering. The only drawback is the size, it is about 26 inches wide."
1,Canon Pro 9000 is pants,"I bought this printer about a year ago. It has been no end of trouble. On the rare occasion it has worked it has produced acceptable prints, but often with banding and lines. Its function is appalling. It is fussy, spends minutes and minutes and minutes gyrating and whirring and doing nothing only to end with an error message. It uses vast amounts of ink which is expensive and most of the ink is consumed in the cleaning process and the whirring that it does. I really recommend that you do not buy this printer. You will spend time with service agents, tearing your hair out, screaming at the thing saying, 'why is it doing that,' when in the end it does nothing. The paper jams, and the mechanics operate inconsistently. Avoid this printer at all costs."
1,ink vampire,"I received this printer as a replacement for the i9900.The I9900 was great. Fast, with great quality photos.This printer is the pits. It is slow, with inconsistent colors, and one other big thing!!! It uses more ink than any printer I have ever had. Every other print job requires a $14 cartridge.On top of that, the print settings are cryptic.God help you when the print heads start to clog. Your first print is one color and every print after that shifts a little.I hate this printer and frankly feel duped, after loosing what I considered the best printer I have ever had, the I9900."
2,Mine doesn't work,"I bought the Pixma Pro 9000 about a year & a half ago and it worked great for about 6 months and then the feed quit working.Prints looked great when it was working and I used Canon & Ilford Gloss & Semi-gloss (pearl) paper.Wish it was still working and I am too busy to haul it in to get looked at, so it sits unused and non-functional.Bummer,Carlton"
1,Missing USB cable,"It would've been great if somewhere on this item description page it informed buyers that the printer comes without the USB cable necessary to link the printer to the computer. Here I was setting up my printer and the USB port cable the instructions informed me I needed to plug in was missing, so I searched the box, searched my living room, searched the trash I threw the packaging away in looking for this cable. Then I called Canon to request one, only to be told it doesn't come with it. Awesome, thanks. You couldn't just include the, what?, $15 cable in the box, Canon?"
5,Great CD!!,"I recommend this CD for all. Sal Solo's voice is amazing. All songs are great. I love ""Heart and soul""."
2,Some things just don't click,"I couldn't pull the willing suspension of disbelief far through. Some characters were a bit unrealistic. I don't want to spoil the ending, but Sally's attitude towards her husband seemed impossible to me, in light of everything that had happened. The plot was at times difficult to follow. This is not my favorite genre, so take my comment with a huge mountain of salt."
1,Don't buy this until it's fixed!,"I've been using Quicken since it was invented (cir. 1988) - and version 1.0 that ran on my 8088 PC was better than this one. Not only were my files scrambled beyond repair when converting from Q-99, but electronic bill pay was totally scrambled. Intuit's help line was a little use - though they didn't charge me their hourly rate.To make matters worse, once you start using '03, with Wells Fargo bank, I was *unable* to revert back to the old version. You're stuck!Intuit came out with a patch, but it still doesn't fix irritating bugs like windows being resized and moved on each startup, and the ""customize reports"" pane is chopped off halfway (I'm serious - this is a glaring bug!).I'm w-a-y dissapointed in Intuit that they'd release such a buggy piece of software."
4,"A great, tough notebook that's easy to label and organize","Nice, durable notebook for meetings or classes. It's hardback and I like that about it but there are other 'lab style' books that have everything this has but also have other options such as having stickers inside that you can use to easily label it for ease-of-use later when you're looking for 'that certain notebook' and for a lower price.But for what it is, this isn't a bad notebook."
1,Way way overpriced now!,"I bought one of these last year for HALF the price it's listed at now ($14). It's just a #@##!!## notebook! I'd feel like a fool to buy one of these ever again, at this ludicrous price."
5,Love my nano bag!,"This is probably the best investment I made for my baby! I live in a cold winter climate, and this has really made life easier for us! I never have to worry about making sure I have blankets or clothing that is warm enough, even when it's 29 degrees outside! I even went for an evening stroll in a mountain village, and while we were all freezing, my baby slept in his stroller like, well, a baby! You just unzip it when we are in the car so he doesn't overheat. It also folds over the back like they show in the picture if you don't want the hood on, at least on my car seat it does (I put the elastic around the folded-back canopy of my graco carseat).Definately worth the price if you live in cold climate!"
5,The Finest Single Introduction to Anglicanism,"This is an invaluable introduction to Anglicanism in all of its nuances. What are the 39 Articles and why are they important? Who are the major theologians of the Anglican church and why are they called ""divines""? What was the origin and the role of the Book of Common Prayer in shaping and uniting the world-wide Anglican communion? How did it come about that Anglicanism initially was Reformed in theology, but ""catholic"" in structure? That and a host of other pertinent issues germane to a good introductory understanding of Anglicanism are available in a single volume and that alone is a singular feat. I know of nothing similar for Lutheranism, Presbyterianism or Roman Catholicism that is so comprehensive, yet readily intelligible.Highly Recommended."
3,Space Sand Review,"The service and shipping was excellent. I would highly recommend this company. However, the sand was disappointing. It does not all fall to the bottom of the bowl in shapes. There is a fine residue that is left on the surface and it clouds the exciting stuff below."
5,One of Brown's best!!,"Great book. Only too short. Had me laughing and wondering where are all these sensitive guys? That's why they call it fiction, I guess. Taylor is thoughful and kind with a sense of humor, tall good looking, loves foreplay. What more could you ask for? Ria is sassy, smart talented, amusing. Like I said, thats why they call if fiction."
2,Mediocre redo of a well-worn genre,"Aliens from space land on earth and take over the human race. This is essentially the story of this movie. Unfortunately, it is also the basic story of hundreds of other movies, with recent ones being the Species franchise, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and various X-files episodes. So does any part of this movie make it noticeably better than any of the other movies in the same genre? No. Yes there is the attractive Nicole Kidman, but her role in this movie could have been filled by dozens of other actresses. Overall, an OK movie that is good space filler for a lazy night."
3,A lot of good actors in a mediocre re-make *YAWN*,"This is the 3rd remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (or 4th)? Its a great story, but the directors do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING with it. To make things worse, there are alot of good actors in this movie but every scene is done in a predictable manner, by-the-numbers.This movie is not bad, its simply not much of anything. I recommend buying one of the earlier Invasion of the Body Snatcher re-makes rather than ""Invasion""."
2,Tepid,"Nicole Kidman stars as a psychiatrist who notices her patients, her secretary and the rest of the town seems to be acting like emotionless zombies. Together with her doctor boyfriend, they discover an alien lifeform is altering humanity making us more like them. Can she rescue her son, who seems to have a strange immunity to the sickness, or is she destined to join the legion of infected?I was disappointed in this film. I liked the original novel, and this just seemed sort of blah. I never really felt Nicole's character was in jeopardy and I felt she made an unconvincing parent. She seemed physically wrong for the role. She is way overly botoxed/plastic surgered so that her face is like a stretched plastic balloon. Yek. The alien method of contaminating other victims (via projectile vomiting) seemed kind of juvenile. Meh. Overall, this was a limp, lame film, worthy of the sci-fi channel. I would rent if you must, but not buy."
1,Tenth remake of Invasion of the you know what.....,"This is a terrible movie. Both Nicole and Daniel Craig are wasted in a stupid movie that does not scare, shock, frighten, or even send the smallest chill down the spine.It is just a bad script and one long boring scene after another, the ending was bad, and it;s easy to see why when the whole movie was bad also."
3,Virus from space (like body snatchers),"My husband isn't my husband...Yes, we have seen n version of this typeof end of the world sci fi.Here a virus from space takes over people in their sleep.Only the pretty head doctor's boy is immune.No more war, no more fighting...actually no more humanity.Pretty well acted for what used to be a B movie?It seems like everybody is making this end of the world type film?"
4,Pod People Again,"Each incarnation of the Jack Finney story has been a product of the time inwhich the film was made. The original during the Cold War, the Phil Kaufmann remake during a time of Jonestown and other cults. Now this version in the era of the pandemic. This isn't a bad picture. It just isn't remarkably new. Daniel Craig, while working on this picture, got the word he had been tapped to follow Pierce Brosnan as 007."
3,"OLIVER HIRSCHBIEGEL, OPUS 5","*** 2007. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. Fourth adaptation of Jack Finney's novel afterInvasion of the Body Snatchers,Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)andBody Snatchers. The enemy is among us. Enjoyable but already forgotten."
3,Easily Pleased Me,"I saw this movie this last weekend on TV. From the view point of most who have written reviews here I guess I am easily pleased because I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the greatest in sicfi or the worst in remakes. Somewhere in between, I guess you could say. I enjoyed it and did not find that I wasted my time in watching it. For a ten dollar movie ticket I may have wanted more but for a weekend find on TV or a rental it hit the spot."
2,To slooooow,"You've got that botox!Hahah na this movie was okay I guess....""aliens"" and kidman oh and don't forget Bond."
1,Faulty product,"I bought the 300x cable two days ago. Since then I have been nothing but frustrated -- though my regular AV cable that came with the console still works perfectly, I get NOTHING from the Monster cable -- the ring on the Xbox just blinks green and orange, signifying a bad AV connection. No amount of fiddling has made a difference. On top of this, Monster's customer support was almost nonexistent. Xbox's support was helpful, but they confirmed what I suspected from the process of elimination. This cable is the problem. For the price I paid, you'd think I'd get a product that worked, and barring that, at least some service from the manufacturer! I'll never buy Monster again."
2,Lacks the craftsmanship and durability of my old Eureka tent,"While searching online to replace a broken support pole for my Eureka Tetragon 7 tent, I read several disappointing reviews for this product with which I must concur. When putting this tent into use (it serving as a replacement for my old but missing Eureka tent), my first observation was that this tent lacks the sturdiness and apparent quality of my old Eureka tent - which saw many years of active use. This newer Eureka tent, in contrast with my old Eureka, has a flimsy and loose feel. After relatively brief and careful use, a supporting pole of my Tetragon 7 tent cracked and splintered. To me it does appear that this tent does not possess the craftsmanship and durable construction of the old Eureka tent. The several critical reviews here are correctly reported, and particularly so with regard to the brittle support poles of this tent."
2,I wish it didn't leak in the rain,"I live in an area with long dry seasons, so I loved this tent when I first got it. It's convenient to set up. I didn't have any construction issues, unlike some similarly priced tents I've owned. I also loved the weight--on the rare occasions my kids wanted to come into the backcountry, we packed this tent and slept 2 adults & 2 kids with only 7 or so pounds of pack weight.And then we camped in the rain.We went on a car camping trip with both the Tetragon 7 and Tetragon 5. We had steady rain for two nights, and on those nights we had steady leaking in the tent from the window zipper. This area is not covered by the rainfly & is not sealable. Basically, this tent is now retired, except for trips when I can guarantee no rain.Verdict? Very light for its size, no useful vestibule, leaks badly."
5,Final Fantasy XI,"All I can say is its a great game,I've been playing it for 6yrs. And I love it.Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia, Rise Of The Zilart, Treasures of Aht Urhgan"
3,Not quite as good as it would seem,"This 10 inch Sony portable is a very nice looking device and it definitely has all the features you need. However, after comparing the quality of the screen resolution to the Toshiba SD-2700, I would conclude it's not all that great. This device is quite expensive at (retail) $799.00 and therefore I would expect a much higher quality screen resolution.I wonder how long we have to wait before Sony will release a portable dvd player that utilizes it's XBrite LCD Monitor technology?? If you've seen a Sony laptop computer with an XBrite screen, you'll know what I'm talking about."
2,Glacial Pace,"This book opens with a fast-paced series of scenes involving a promising hero and his partner, who, alas, are quickly killed off. Then the REAL story begins, rather like a locomotive pulling too much freight: very s-l-o-w-l-y. The freight is a ton of background information about the miseries of modern Russia, and the author wants us to have it all. After 60 pages, the train hadn't even left the station, and I gave up. There may be a great story there somewhere in the next 380 pages, but the author didn't make it worth my while to find out."
2,Siberian Light,"The book lacks the luster of Robyn White's Typhoon -- so much so that you wonder of this author is another Robin White. The read begins with a slow start -- the introduction of numerous Russian characters, place locations, and Russian politics that it is easy to get lost in the names and have trouble following the plot. However, after a slow start, the books picks up and becomes more fascinating. The Russian political corruption and general lifestyle described makes you think he is describing some backwards third-world country. It makes one wonder why we ever thought the Russians were a threat to our Western life-style."
4,Love it!,I use this product as a deep conditioner with a heating cap. I mix it with some extra virgin coconut oil and it leaves my very soft.
1,"Annoying, Horrible Book","This book should have never been printed. Very poor characters and plot, annoyingly unbelievable. Oh sure, the CIA would let Bess direct the action and dictate their behavior. I wanted to slap some sense into her. She was obnoxious, stupid and reckless. Bodies fall all around her because of her self-centered obsession. She stupidly minimizes her importance as a walking antidote for a deadly biological agent and jeopardizes her own life and that of many others for an infant of three days acquaintance. I've never before encountered a character, the heroine, who I wanted to see killed because she was so bad. I wanted to scream several times at the stupid plotting, characters and dialogue and regret spending money on this nonsense. I won't be reading another Iris book."
1,what a waste of time,"The title and jacket cover were totally misleading. I thought the plot would entail a mystery, perhaps intertwining with the supernatural or something just as interesting. What a let down!! I couldn't even get pass chapter 3!! And I'm ususally the first person to give a novel the benefit of the doubt. But this one?? it was awful. It felt like sheer torture trying to get through it. Unless you're an incredibly boring person who likes a read that will either put you to sleep or highly confuse you or both, I would not suggest reading it. As a matter of fact, if this is the first novel by Johansen that you pick up, it just might very well be your last."
1,Worst book I've ever read!,This book was so horrible I can't even say! I had to end it early to put myself out of my misery!
2,"I'm 125 pages in, asking the same question I asked on p. 15","Why am I READING this???This book was tersely-written & emotionless. It was a very heavy-handed attempt at drawing in mainstream readership. I read a C. Coulter work (The Cove) that I disliked almost as much as I dislike this book. It had that same dialogue-heavy style, along with annoying, illogical characters, and lack of sexual tension between H&H. If you're into poorly crafted books and you've got money to burn, by all means, buy this complete waste of paper. But don't say I didn't warn ya..."
5,It was a great book.,"This wasn't my first Iris Johanssen novel, before it, I had read, Long Before Midnight, but had not liked it. It was okay, but I didn't like the part when Noah is killed. But I decided to try another, and I,m glad I did, becasue it was great. Bess Grady is a very cool heroine. The romance between her and Kaldak was very intersting, and I love how she twists everything around."
1,Main character is not believable,"The story line is a good one. The characters, especially Bess could not exist in the real world--someone would have throttled her at first mouth opening. People just do not speak as these characters do."
5,Clasic,Undoubted a classic of its kind. Simon had unprecentented access to police officers and their work. Gives a geniune picture of police homicide investigations.
3,Photos missing from Kindle edition,"The print edition of 'Homicide' has a 8-page set of black and white photos in the middle:1) 6 portraits of detectives that appear in the book.2) below them 6 pictures of the characters they inspired in the TV series.3) and three more: 2 detectives at a crime scene, David Simon at the pub with the guys, The Board.These pictures are gone from the Kindle edition. Whereas this is a rather minor loss, you are not missing anything essential from the reading experience, something has been subtracted from one edition nevertheless. So you've been warned."
4,Adds depth to the TV series,"A very good read for someone who likes the series. Also adds important lingo for those (like me) who are interested in criminal investigations and the development of forensic evidence. Gives insight as to the motivations of homicide detectives (there's money in murder) and how the prosecutor is so dependent on a good detective for a strong legal case. Shows how criminals and suspects are treated in the system, and the way that a suspect's rights are protected (or not) in this system. Very enlightening! Only reservation is that the book is verbose and meandering at times."
4,Contains Much Realism,"This is a very realistic account of a year in the lives of one shift of homicide detectives written by a newspaper reporter that reads as well as fiction. You are right there at the crime scenes with the primary detectives when they roll the body over looking for clues, when they interview the witnesses, fill out the paperwork and go out for drinks after work when the board is changed from red to black, signifying the case has been closed. You can get a real appreciation as to what it is like to be an underpaid, underappreciated and overworked homicide investigator in a major city. Interrrogation techniques are revealed in this unique book. Some trial action. Definitely worth the read. Contains real life violence. A good companion to the TV show."
3,Underwhelming,"Given the hype, I expected to like this book more than I did. As the author was ""embedded"" with the detectives there is little balance in his reportage of them. They are all likeable types with some quirkiness. Perhaps I might have enjoyed the book more had I read it when it was first published in 1991. Reading it now, I found its style to be a bit dated."
3,"Interesting Plot, author has difficulty presenting it",The author develops this plot so slowly that I'm amazed he is a journalist by profession. Perhaps that's a refelction of why journalism today is so lousy. I found the development of the plot and the writing of the book so cumbersome that I've put it down and read other books three times.... Oh I'll finish it on some night when I've read and reread all other books in the house....
4,Avery Note Cards,"This is a good product although I wish a heavier cardstock had been used. These note cards are fine for casual use but are not professional quality. Still, I am thankful that they are available because papers and cardstock appropriate for laser printers are hard to find in stores."
2,Not Happy,"I recieved my order and was shocked to find that the contents looked like it had been run over by a truck!The package was damaged, and when I opened it, one corner of all thirty pageswas bent. This means that out of the sixty cards I recieved only thirty of them will be suitable for printing.Not Happy!"
3,It's what you would expect for the price.,"The picture frame was just something I had to pick up quickly. I bought a piece of art and didn't want it to get damaged. I won't be hanging it up until I move, so this frame is virtually useless to me for the moment. It doesn't have a back stand so you can't prop it up on a table to display or anything like that. I found myself expecting it to have something on the back of the frame to stand it up on a table until I could hang it on the wall. I was a bit disappointed, but the frame itself looks beautiful for the price. Definitely get it if you plan on hanging it on the wall."
4,6x8 Frame - Style #609,"Quite a number of places where I shop, did not have this ""not-so-popular"" size, but I found it at Amazon. The style is attractive, but not gaudy, and suited a variety of style oil paintings I am completing for table-top display with the option of grouping on a wall. Thank you."
2,6 x 8 picture frames,"I needed a couple of 6 x 8 picture frames for some photo enlargements that I have. I ordered two identical frames of the 6 x 8 size from MyFrameStore. While I received the order quickly, I received one 6 x 8 frame and one 5 x 7 frame of a different style. They were both of good quality, but I needed 6 x 8 frames -- you can buy 5 x 7 frames everywhere.I didn't bother to return the 5 x 7 frame as it's not worth the trouble. But I was disappointed in the MyFrameStore's handling of my order."
3,XBOX MONSTER COMPONENT VIDEO CABLE,VERY WELL BUILT COMPONENT CABLE SET. IMPROVES PICTURE QUALITY ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX. YOU CAN NOW RUN YOUR XBOX AT UPTO 1080I (with a modded xbox).
1,Expensive Cable Garbage Quality *Beware*,"This Cable I thought would be of Excellent make and performance but No I was mistaken. I went to plug this onto my Brand New TV's Component Jacks and the A/V Plug ends kept snapping off(The outer ring that goes around the jack)!! They are supposed to bend to keep a tight connection but instead I would say about 15 pieces of the little circular ends snapped off and now they are only connected by a few that didn't break. 24K Gold my ass. I now know and will say without second thought that MONSTER Cables are Overrated and we are being overcharged for something that is not up to Par with something half as cheap. Do yourself a favor and find another cable, don't waste time or money like I did and wind up regretting it."
4,"Great cables, a bit overpriced.","These cables are awesome, braided cable, gold plated, and long length and I don't regret buying them even for a second. I just wish I could've bought these cables for a bit cheaper but I understand why they are priced high. I honestly think these cables will last forever they are of just such high quality!"
2,Too James Bondish not Larry Bond,I came away disappointed from reading Day of Wrath. The two intrepid heroes fighting alone against impossible odds and a nuclear countdown are well too outlandish for someone who has written so much better fare. This book has the feel and look of just another royalty check for the author.
4,Day of Wrath,This was another good story. Great writing. It is a pretty good thriller and I am glad I read it.
3,Fair - Nothing special fiction,Listened to it on books on tape (BOT?) and it did keep me awake between Madison and Indy! Fair book - some interesting technical information and only a few moments when I was wondering where are the brains of the two main characters!
2,What a disappointment!,"I looked forward to reading this book. Normally I can read Larry Bond's books in two or three days, they're so engrossing. This one took me almost a month. I had to force myself to continue reading most of it. Totally unbelieveable cardboard characters - and that's the two heroes. If Bond's next book has these two characters (Thorn and Gray) in it, I'm not going to bother to read it. Like I'm going to believe those two can off scores of highly trained killers with every time of gun and hand to hand combat on three continents and save the USA from nuclear annihilation. Not a single reason to like these two cartoon characters. C'mon Larry, I know you can do better because I read your other books."
4,"Very durable, I use it for outdoor signs and indoor permanent marking","I have labels on pipes indoors that are 5 years old and they hold up great.Commended product. Printer sometimes has difficulty picking up the page.Also, don't run it twice, so print two labels or toss the unused one, or it will not work well. The printer heat is too much to go through twice."
1,A hard slog,Boy what a hard slog. I only kept at this book because the next two in the New Jedi Order series are by Michael Stackpole. Speed-read it if you can. Why couldn't Del Rey commission Timothy Zahn to write in this arc?
4,Vector Prime (Star Wars),"I have seen many knock around this book for the death of Chewie but I do understand what the author is doing. Think about it for a minute The Characters are getting old.. and they are mortal characters with a life line of about 100 years so they will die in reality.. what I think the author was doing is subjecting us to the horror of reality in which even the good-guys can die. I for one thought the book was a solid addition to the starwars universe. The plot was solid though mystic(hoping to learn more about the new enemies in upcoming novels),fast paced, and introduces a new character."
3,Bre's,"Firstly, I'd like to say what I liked about this book. Finally, the safety of the characters is no longer assured, adding to the tension. The Solo children have their own personalites. The galaxy is no longer some big, happy playground where no one of importance gets hurt. It starts of in a new direction, and breathes a little life into that far away galaxy. It has a good plot. The characterisations - with the exception of Han and Mara (few people get them right) - are good.Now for what I didn't like. The writing style is very ordinary. Too ordinary. This may be a Star Wars book, but that is no reason why a few literary niceties can't be included. Second, are Luke and Mara really in love? Because they sure aren't acting like it? And why, may I ask, have they no children yet? I thought that the fans of Star Wars would be thrilled to see Luke as a father. They're both getting to old. Something needs to be done about this."
3,Two Thirds In ...,"... and I'm dead halted at the beginning of chapter 18. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but all true Star Wars fans will take a moment of pause after Chapter 17 let me tell you.Well, as a quick review for would be buyers of this book, some quick comments. I'm not too big on the author's writing style, but as he is more accustomed to fantasy than Staw Wars, I can accept that. But one comment stands out in my mind. I hate how he keeps using the characters' full names when mentioning them. Also, a glosary of the words and how to say them would be helpful. But aside from those few things, it's going pretty well. Interesting story and race. If I can I'll post when I'm finished reading it. And a special note, for a lost friend ... ""Naaarrrrllll!"""
1,What Happened To The First 50 Reviews?,"This book is uninspired trash that rips off other writers of SW, except for the characters, they don't resemble anything I've ever read. There were a lot of reviews in the beginning that brought the rating down, and miraculously disappeared. This book betrays everything that is SW. Probably George needed to create controversy to get SW back on people's mind so they would go see Phantom Menace. SHOW ME THE MONEY! Thanks George."
4,Quite a good Star Wars book!,"Having read almost every Star Wars book in the series, I approached this book with some trepidation, already aware of the ONE big event that happens in the course of the story. However, I found it to be quite good. Salvatore has a flair for characters and keeps the Star Wars gang true to form. The Yuzahn Vong are just plain scary, possibly the nastiest villians ever presented in this series. Unlike many of the Empire's remnants, the Yuzahn Vong are extremely dangerous and will stop at nothing; couple this with their alien technology and we now have some foes worthy of a Star Wars tale. Good show!"
5,Great possibility added to the Star Wars galaxy,"Vector Prime is really good. I am by no means a proffesional book critic, but I can say that it is good and I wonder why people say it is bad. Sure, there is not much romance between Luke and Mara, but a lot happens with relationships between Jacen, Jaina, Anakin, and the adults. A lot of character development occurs, and that really helps out. Another thing that people complain about is the surprise that Salvatore puts in. Sure, it's sad, but it shouldn't make people say, ""Well, that's awful!"" Surprises happen, and characters only live for a certain amount of time. I'm glad Salvatore took it upon his shoulders to write what happened. That shows that he is a good author."
3,Not up to par,"I thought the author came up with some interesting ideas for organic technology and though Chewie's alleged demise stung (this piece of the plot has already been revealed by other reviewers) the author was not betraying the Star Wars universe by this act. (Han's thoughts at the end about how his little bubble of security was shattered was quite fitting - to what we all felt about the characters.) What I do have a problem with was the superficial feel of the characters. I didn't CARE about them and that's a major flaw in writing. I never felt they really came alive. The villians were vicious and I was mildly interested in how unique they were but, again, the auther failed to really breath life into them. Follow-up books in the Star Wars universe have some pretty big shoes to fill but I felt this book could have been better if the author had given more attention to character development/portrayal. Some good ideas but only a mediocre story."
5,Awesome beginning for a series!!,"This is an incredible book. I absolutely loved the fact that it guided me back into the world of star wars instead of assuming you know the entire previous saga. Although there are several sad elements to this book, I really enjoyed the entire process! Definitely recommend!"
3,Vector Prime,"This book was a ""so-so"" book, The death of Chewbacca sucked and I HATED the fact there was no Empire...In Vision of the FUture the Empire's goals were realistic and intresting."
1,Grrrr!!,"I was going to read this book.......but then my best friend told me all about it!! Boy am I PEEVED!! RA Salvatore killed Chewie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE DID IT!!!!! HE MURDERED THAT INNOCENT LOVABLE WOOKIEE!!!!! You dolt you could have killed Ta'a Chume, or someone!!! And where in KESSEL has Tenel Ka gone? Since the New Jedi Order came out she's been missing. Okay...personally I think that he shouldn't be allowed to write another Star Wars book, because if he does, Mara Jade will die. Not happening. GET A CLUE AND GET SALVATORE OFF THE AUTHOR LIST!!!"
2,Good But not Star Wars,"This book is good but is not made with the quality you come to expect from a Star Wars book. I am a big Star Wars fan and love Star Wars books, but while I was reading this one I did not feel like I was in the Star Wars universe. This is because the characters did not have the same personality as in other books. This book disappointed me. With the death of a main character the books that come after this time period will be limited. The disease Mara Jade has also took out some of the enjoyment. This is not one of those books that you can't put down. I would have rated this book higher if it was not Star Wars because it is too unbelieveable for Star Wars."
1,"SUCKY BOOK. BORROW FROM A FRIEND, BUT DON'T BUY.","This has got to be the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. The was nothing ""star wars"" about. The whole living weapons thing from the Vong(Youhzog or Prearite, who cares) was ridicules at BEST. The no resolution to Mara's problem sucked. Superweapons and space opera is what Star Wars is about. I liked the fact that is was a short read, not the long drawn out nothingness of Mr. Zahn. If there are any powers that be out there, please DO NOT let Mr. Salvatore back into the Star Wars universe. Even though it happened a long time ago, Star Wars should be hi-tech and science fictional. Not organical."
4,"yeah, death is sad","yeah, death is sad, but this is star wars...which means that eventually Chewie will be found alive, having come through some strange and incredibly lucky adventure that saved his life, from an otherwise certain death. Look at Boba Fett, we all thought he was dead at the end of ROTJ but lo and behold, he comes back having gone through hell and back to do it. And besides...would George Lucas really authorize the death of one of his main characters? In my opinion, this is not the last of Chewbacca... oh, and the book was pretty good too :)"
3,Tolerable,"I found this book hard to follow. The best parts of the book were the beginning and the end. The book does have a good set up for following books, but other Star Wars books in the New Jedi Order Series are much better. So read this book as fast as you can and look forward to the following books."
2,ITS NOT STARWARS WITHOUT CHEWIE,"TWENTY-ONE YEARS AFTER ENDOR... TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTERYAVIN...THE NEW REPUBLIC IS ABOUT TO FACE AN INCREDIBLY,SEEMINGLY INVINCIBLE FOE! WILL THE GALAXY EVER BE THESAME SAFE PLACE IT USED TO BE IN THE MINDS OF OUR FAVORITEHEROS... BUT WAIT ...ONE OF OUR HEROS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHINGON HIS MIND AT ALL! WE'LL ALL MISS YOU CHEWIE!"
4,Good start to a Good Series,"Let me start by saying that i love star wars. Always have, always will. I read a lot of star wars books for a while but then i kinda took a break. When i saw that i new series started, i thought hey, why dont i give it a chance, start reading some star wars again. I had my socks blown off. I read this book in about a day, which is pretty good for me. I didnt put it down. I even begged my parents to drive me to the store so that i could buy the next two books in the series also. So i dont know why so many fans hate the New Jedi Order. In fact it got me back into star wars. Oh spoilers ahead though, the reason i didnt give this book five stars is because they killed off one of the main characters who everybody loves. I mean killing Chewbacca only led to some bad times for Han that no one enjoyed to read. So other than that this is one of the best star wars series ever. Go get it now."
1,NO MORE SALVATORE!!!,I hope Salvatore will not be allowed to write any more Star Wars books. I don't plan on buying any books by this author.
3,"Not Zahn, but not bad","Vector Prime is not a bad book - the story is clever, the bad guys are pretty cool, and the action scenes are, for the most part, interesting. My main problem with the whole story is that I find the whole Jedi kid thing really boring. I'v never been a fan of Anakin, Jacen, or Jaina, and though I am a big fan of Salvatore, I don't see why he felt pressured to use them so much. Personally, after reading the 5 Zahn books, I just can't see Star Wars novels without Talon Karrde - though I'm almost skeptical about giving him over to another author...maybe Zahn should write all the novels.... Otherwise though, the book is sound. If you like the kids and a basically all-Jedi cast (save for poor Han and Lando), you'll probably really enjoy the story."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is without a doubt the worst Star Wars book in print today. It surpasses Darksaber in tedium and stupidity. The plot is predictable, the villians are trite, and the characters are as wooden as my front door. Vector Prime does have its moments though. There are some funny scenes involving Chewie, but overall the book is a real stinker. I had high hopes for this novel considering the good start the Hand of Thrawn Duology had given but it was a profound letdown. Hopefully the powers that be in the Star Wars franchise will not allow another magnificent blunder like Vector Prime in the future. As for Mr. Salvatore's writing style I think it best that he should stick to novels with titles beginning with the word Demon and stay as far away from the Star Wars universe as possible. If you want to read a good Star Wars book stay away from Vector Prime and reread the Hand of Thrawn Duology."
2,Star Wars is not a D&D fantasy,"I have not previously read Salvatore's work before but am familiar with his work as I am also a reader of his obviously preferred genre. He should stick with it. I resent the significant departures from established characterizations rampant through the book. The nearly omnipotent capabilities of his organic menagerie were ridiculous, and his concept of physics, as particularly demonstarted in the defeat of the ""war coordinator"" and the bugs that fly through space, nonexistant. SW is SCIENCE fiction and some liberties are taken but most have some plausibility for future technology. But cooling a planet through evaporation by adding energy....back to physics 101 guy. Or stick to demons and devils where you can make up anything you want."
3,"Enjoyable, but totally out of character","The newest Star Wars book is put simply a fun read. But, there are some problems: first of all, characters. The book reduces Han Solo to barely even a person and doesn't focus on him, Leia or Luke. And come on Mara being sick? Why did the writer do that, Mara Jade is the most awesome character ever to grace the pages of a Star Wars book. Also, the book is graphic, in violence and content, definately not on the lines of the Jar Jar BInks infested Episode I, what was George Lucas thinking when he okayed this book!"
3,"Swivel range inadequate, other quirks","This sprayer works ok but three things I didn't like: when you turn the water off it reverts from spray back to stream -- no biggie. ALso, the swivel sange is totally inadequate to cover any kitchen sink -- biggie. And if you try to make it reach further, it forces it to revert to stream -- annoying. ALl in all it not adequate. The Danco 88270 360-Degree Swivel Aerator and Sprayer works much better, costs less, and has no quirks like this one."
1,Broken within 48 hours,"I was prepared to give this aerator 4 stars. However, less than 2 days after we installed it, while I was pulling down for the spray setting, it developed a leak in the rubber connection between the top and bottom halves. The next time, it tore straight off.I can't recommend this to anyone except as a practical joke."
1,endless piffle,pee yew! This one is a stinker. I realize you must suspend belief when reading fiction. But for 550 never ending pages? Give this one a miss. Read The Eight instead.
5,Awesome,"Having just read Neville's magic circle, I am now a confirmed fan.Neville's awesome scholarship - and I should know having studied the Late Antique/messianic period - underpins and drives, rather than hampers the rip-roaring plot which rivals the Illuminati Trilogy for wierdness and dramtic settings. The parallel plotline has the added advantage of making the distant past seem... real. Only the ending, with its somehow anti-climatic revelation, marred an otherwise perfect book. Mind you, getting off a roller-coaster is also anti-climatic, and even a Jimi Hendrix solo has to come to an end at some point."
1,VERY HARD TO FOLLOW,This was a very difficult book to read and understand. The events seemed so bizarre and twisted that it became harder and harder to follow with each chapter. I don't understand why the author wrote such a complicated family set of relationships as it didn't really have that much to do with the plot and the ending. What was magical about the entire book?
3,Reading this book takes a lot of effort,"Let me say this first. I love to read. I'll read anything, no matter how complicated, no matter how long. But, folks, I gotta say-- I just about threw in the towel on this one. It starts out in one direction, turns a corner into another direction, then again changes course. On and on till I am wondering if it's all a bad dream. This is not a book you can lay down for a couple of days, then pick it up again, without a lot of review work. You'll find yourself flipping pages to check and double check what went before because of the plot twists. Also, there are numerous ""stories"" within the main story, and they are much too detailed and become tedious. The author knows her stuff, she obviously has done tons of research, but this is definitely a book for people who want to learn a lot of history, and have a lot of patience. I am glad I read it, but frankly, I'm pretty exhausted."
1,BORING!,What a waste of money... At the end I was angry and absolutely tired of all those boring relationships and strange members of Ariels family. The beginning was rather interesting but then... actually I would get my money back from Mrs. Neville for such boring nonsense...
2,It was almost good,"Neville missed the mark on this one. As a fan of The Eight and Calculated Risk, I expected her pattern of weaving in and out of history, mysticism, and adventure. Somehow, in this one, I got lost. Underneath all the layers she hints at a fascinating story that intrigues and wets the appetite. I found myself becoming more and more frustrated as the real meat of the story was set aside without enough follow through in favor of piecemeal action that felt shallow and directionless"
5,Deep and profound,"I'm still in the process of completing ""The Magic Circle"" and intrigued by how much of what she writes is expressing the knowledge that I myself have been led to over many years as well as pointing to connections with people I have met. My own life is obviously part of the greater story, so one might think of me as one of the ""messengers"". I'm truly moved by the depth of this profound book."
3,Good but Complex,"I bought this book because I loved 'The Eight'. The Magic Circle continues the intellectual and somewhat mystical content, but in a much more complex plot. Also, I found that there was much less action and danger portrayed in this book in comparison. The book kept my interest throughout, but I found myself having to reach for the dictionary more than once to try to understand what was going on! And if Ariel had had any more relatives I would have screamed! I think this book rates a re-read."
1,"WHAT A STRANGE, BIZARRE BOOK","The book seemed to be an endless stream of predictable ""surprises"" mixed with a horribly confusing set of character relationships. Complicated family trees of the main character definitely detracted from appreciating any other fine points in the book. The romance in the book was also lost in the twists and turns of the plot. No real surprises or situations that left me wondering...instead, I found all too familiar twists and predictable ending."
1,ONE WORD -- BORING,This book seems like a colossal tease. The entire premise is one big bore and each chapter takes you through a mindless mess of confusion. What was the point of it all? It sure escapes me.
3,A classic example of any strength in excess becomes ineffect,"I had not read Neville previously. Reading the reviews it would appear that I should have purchased ""The Eight"".I found the attempt to integrate religion, history, Roman Mythology, and present day issues much to laborious and blurry to value.Use of ""flasback techniques"" can be effective. However, if it is used in excess it makes the reader work to hard to understand just what is the connectivity. The best example is when Neville try ies to use ""geography"" of the world and the power of specific locations and relics as reference points that the reader must comprehend.Neville's gift for richness is overshadowed by excessive complexity. Time to rexamine the recipe."
3,It's paper,"Okay so, it did what is was supposed to do. It was the measurements as described and my kids use it on an easel. Nuff said."
2,Not all assembly equipment included,The correct size screws were not included and the manual was not easy to read. I received it about 4 days ago and still have not been able to put it together because I have to go to a store that sells the screws that the seller did not submit.
1,So cheap I had to return it...,"I am really disappointed in this product. The conveyor part did not spin properly and I would be walking and it would cause me to stop about every thirty seconds. My husband put it together pretty easily. He also disassembled it easily and we returned it. I rarely go to the trouble of returning items but we returned this. I am also really surprised about how many positive reviews it had, maybe I received a dud."
3,Great for walking--not for running,"Easy to setup. Fairly sturdy. You do have to hold on to make sure to keep your balance on this manual treadmill--but that is probably for all types since you do have to expend effort to get it moving.Biggest drawback is that you can't use it for running. The computer can't register speeds above 3.4mph, so if you are a fast walker, you are out of luck. You can't really use it for running, because there's no spring to absorb the shock--your feet will push the belt onto the base and it cause it to move rather jerky than smoothly, and you don't want that if you're trying to run.Good for the price if you are just going to walk, but if you need more, better search elsewhere."
2,not a good quality treadmill,"This product is not for use for running. At a speed of 6 or more the belt starts to slip! Very disappointed with this product, after reading the reviews I thought I was getting a good quality treadmill."
4,Michael's favourite,And this is what my 5-year-old nephew wanted. I am glad I got it for him. It took me some time to find it. I'm sure he will enjoy a lot.
4,New Ride,"I read Wiseguy from Nicholas Pileggi and loved the book, though it was spot on with the movie Goodfellas with a few minor exceptions. The book Casino does however differ greatly from the movie of the same name, so it was much more enjoyable for me. Certainly the basics are still there, but many additional stories, altered stories and the timeline is a little off from the movie. Pileggi writes well and does great research. If you want to have more fun look up the real life people portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. It was amazing that Pesci and Stone looked just like the real life people. DeNiro wasn't even close, but he did a good job."
4,"you've seen the movie, now read the book","seriously, read the book. if you liked casino but wanted a more just the facts account of the story, the book delivers. the book offers more points of views than the movie did and additional information to flesh out events."
4,Pretty good read.,"I am a mafia buff and since I had already seen ""Casino"" it had only made sense to read the book. The book itself is very informative but I don't suggest it to someone who has NOT seen the movie. It is not very fluid and you can get easily confused with who's who. The characters change very rapidly and it's hard to keep up. I found myself rereading passages just to make sure I had everything correct. All in all it was a good read and I do recommend it for all who are interested in the subject."
4,Casino Review,"In the Desert of Las Vegas Nevada is where a lot of the problems of the heads of the Stardust casino are solved. The bright lights of Las Vegas do not shield the darkness of the desert surrounding it. In the novel Casino Nicholas Pileggi delves deep into the lives of the shady side of Las Vegas and the people who run it. The protagonist Frank AKA Lefty Rosenthal makes sure the readers understand that if you love someone you have to trust them with your life, with everything that you have because if you don't than what is the point of being in love. But Nicholas Pileggi puts in his own underlying message of in the life of a mobster you cannot trust anyone including your best friend and your wife. This book is full of non stop action and suspense. It gives you an inside look at the lives of the mobsters that made las vegas famous. I highly suggest readin Casino by Nicholas Pileggi."
3,At the end the writer misses the point,"The book is good at the beginning, I can't tell you that it goes out of the story because everything written in the book is related to the story, but some parts of the book are really boring.Everybody knows that in Vegas the mob owns the hotels & casinos at least at first, but what I really don't believe is that the casinos now, at this moment are the cleanest business in the country, maybe they don't take the money as 30 years ago, but I'm sure that in Vegas are many tricks with the bets and the money no matter if now in Vegas have one theme park in every hotel & casino.At the end of the book, if the wife of ""Lefty"" Rosenthal was killed or not, who really cares?"
3,stand is a real problem,"I didn't pay attention to the dimensions, so I was really surprised by how small it is, but that's my fault. The stand does not stay in unless the clock is set on a surface and not touched. Pick it up and the stand falls off. I used Gorilla Glue to secure it, but the glue expanded just enough to push the stand out a touch too far, so now it easily tips forward. If this were a bit bigger and the stand stayed in, this would be a 5. The clock itself works well and has all the details you need to teach time telling."
2,"Visually appealing, poorly functioning","The clock is very readable. Unfortunately, the hour hand only turns if the minute hand is spun. I have to do 6 full revolutions of the minute hand to get from 6 to 12 o'clock with the hour hand. Also, the hour hand gradually gets out of sync with the minute hand by about one-two minutes per hour."
5,Great Teaching Clock,"My son LOVES this clock. He is 2 yr old, and always wants to know what time it is. I got this clock for him, and we are starting to teach him how to read it. It is a great teaching tool, and durable enough for my son to play with at the same time."
5,Not available in stores,"I thought this was going to be easy to find in the stores, but no one seems to carry these items any more. I was glad to find it here. Just what we needed. We don't do Cassettes very often now, but when we do, we need labels."
3,Surprisingly effective,"3 1/2Though its tribal pulse can become repetitious within relaxed limitations and lengthy output, VW still stands as a successful jazz new-age crossover, exhibiting an accessibly mysterious warmth throughout which should excite newcomers without alienating fans."
3,Not His Best,"Garbarek has made recordings in a variety of settings that encompass a variety of moods, but Visible World is the first one that has ever prompted my wife to ask me in surprise whether I had just picked up a Kenny G CD. Hmmm. Yes, this is a tuneful, even pretty recording, and although I will admit it is not my favorite Garbarek recording (I'm not really sure what that would be, but the first one I usually recommend to people is I Took up the Runes, or if they are willing to spend a bit more on a two-CD set, Rites), I have found Visible World to be a CD that rewards repeated listening. My hope is that Kenny G fans will try this recording, then move on to some of Garbarek's other recordings, then maybe try his work with Keith Jarrett, all the while broadening their jazz horizons."
5,Sensational,This is the most beautiful book ever! The work of two superb artists portrayed together.
5,Greatest hymns,This cd has all the great hymns of yesterday. Ernie Ford has such a captivating voice and is so easy to listen to.
4,Tennessee Ernie Ford All-Time Greatest Hymns,Love this CD but it is definitely Church Hymns rather than the catchy Spirituals I love to sing along with. Beautiful music to listen to.
2,Not my kind of treehouse,"My boys and I are usually fans of Bob the Builder, including his On Site series, but I really disliked the treehouse section of this one. I thought a treehouse was a house that was built in the branches of a living tree. Nope, the 'treehouse' here starts with cutting down a nice big tree, slicing off a section of the trunk, then plunking that big chunk of wood in someone's backyard. Then they made a fancy wooden playhouse and nailed it to the top of the trunk-section. Add a slide that ends at the nearby play structure, and they call it a treehouse. Ugh."
2,? as to setup,I am thinking of putting this on a ATV. But nowhere do you tell me if you input the diameter of the wheel for calculating purposes. Thus I do not know if it is able to work for different applications such as this.
3,Beautiful layout - very basic features,"I really enjoy the look and feel of this bike computer, but I immediately wanted more features. It doesn't have 'Max Speed,' or 'Average Speed,' and I keep on wanting to know those basic things.Installation is pretty straightforward. The instructions are well written. Use them! There are tricks to getting the magnet positioned right."
5,sonic voyage,"this is an amazingly thought out mixed album: captures a very abstract, almost eerie feel- while still maintaining a funked-up loungy vibe throughout... I would strongly recommend this as a top chill-out compilation. who knew that deep tech-house of ""common factor"" and ""i-cube"" could rub elbows with 70's jazz of ""sun-ra"" and ""herbie hancock"" so smoothly..."
1,Dolby Digital did not work!,"For a company that prides itself on having the best audio and video wires monster made one mistake. They forgot to make sure their product works before they shipped it out. I hooked up my xbox to the game link 200x and monster audio light link 100x and everything video wise was fine. yet I could not turn on the dolby digital in the dash. It seems the xbox did not aknowlege the dolby digital output of the monster cables. For something that costs almost 15 dollars more then the offical xbox packs it should work better and more efficently, but maybe this once i should have gone with the cheaper cables."
2,DON'T BOTHER,I listened to this cd and just couln't stand the way he played these songs. I ended up deleting it from my library. OUCH!!!
4,This has been my best day ever. [ from the brotherhood to a theatre near you ],"2007's Son of Rambow is a brilliant sundance gem, that sparkles with creativity and a childlike, whimsical feeling.Our star is the adorable Will Proudfoot(Bill Milner) who lives a sheltered life with his mother and sister; post the death of his father, that he's still finding his own way to cope with. Colorful cartoon drawings adorn every page of his bible, and thoughts of the son of rambow, looking to save his father from an evil scarecrow cultivate his mind, and with the help of bully turned best friend Lee Carter(Will Poulter) they begin to film an amateur movie based on that very idea.Although it overall runs a little slow, and a few things would have been better off unsaid, it is a lovable, rarity of a film.Not to mention, for fans of Gossip Girl, Ed Westwick makes an appearance as Lee's older brother, which adds some un-needed but enjoyable eye candy."
4,Pretty clever tale,"Pretty clever tale--great job of interweaving to time periods, the past and the future together. I confess I skipped through a lot of the future to focus on the past. Ms Benson, the love interest for Alejandro killed it; it got boring with that little interjection. But the medical history and the witch Sarah were very fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this story!"
2,"Great Premise, Tough Read",I really wanted to get into reading this. But there was something challenging about diving into this. The current year portion was just too drawn out. What could have been written in two sentances took up half a page.
4,Nice Change from cut and dried Medical Thrillers,"I read the sequel to this book first so at times I felt like fast forwarding as I knew some of the outcomes, but I still found myself drawn in by the characters. Her descriptions of the 14th century are good -- I can't comment on the validity of them but they sounded plausible to me. As for the germs in the 21st century, I cannot comment on the validity of that either, but they do sound a little far fetched. </p> If you are looking for a captivating read -- not a suspense, edge of your seat thriller -- try this out for a change of pace. If you take your time you will feel yourself drawn in by the characters and hope and pray they pull through the plague."
2,"It is kind of fun, but ultimately annoying","This book was fun to read. It is fun. Therefore, it should get an awesome review. However, the book suffered from what one might call protaganosis stupidos.. the main characters are unable to take reasonable actions even though they (and others) will surely die do to their inanity. If it weren't for this terrible flaw, it would be worth reading. Imagine a book in which there is a vaccine on the shelf, that you are told about, and the characters know about, but they for some reason never do, even though they are dying. Is that exciting? If it is for you, then buy the book."
3,A good distraction,"Overall, this was a good book. I especially liked how Benson alternated chapters in telling the two stories. I expected to get confused trying to switch back and forth between two stories but Benson kept both plots simple enough to follow. I was, however, disappointed with the ending. I thought it would come to a more stupendous conclusion, tying up all the loose ends and tying together the two plot lines better. Instead, the ending seemed anticlimatic, much like Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain. All in all, The Plague Tales is a good distraction from the monotonies of daily life."
3,reminded me of _The Doomsday Book_ by Connie Willis,"although it was perhaps a bad choice to read right after i'd read the Doomsday Book (another plague-medieval time/modern plague-near-future timeframe book with a markedly different plot), i enjoyed this book quite a bit. there were a few parts that were a little slow and hard to plow through, but i found the stories for the most part quite enthralling."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I have to agree with Pampered Mom. I was so excited about getting this, but this thing is completely worthless. With brand new batteries, it has next to no power and stops rotating as soon as it hits skin. Kind of defeats the purpose, right?Save your money and go for the old pumice stone instead."
1,LASTS ABOUT A YEAR,"I bought this product 14 months ago. While it was working, I was not impressed: it's very loud, doesn't get in corners, battery doesn't keep a good charge (30 minutes then recharge for hours) and I always had to run over it again with a mop. After about 4-5 months the battery quit and the company sent me another one at no charge. However, now it's 2 months after the warranty expired, and the motor has died. The company offered to send me one at discounted price, but at roughly $300 a year, I said no thanks. Don't waste your money on this expensive, sub-quality product till the makers can get it right."
1,Product is NOT a refurbished 5900,"I have been so anxious to receive my Scooba. I have told everyone about it and they are waiting to hear all about it, and borrow it. As you can imagine, I was SO disappointed to receive the older model. I saw the two other reviews who said they also received the wrong item. Amazon customer service said they will ship out the right one with one day shipping. I asked how she could be sure they would send the right one, and she told me not to worry, they would. I am most confident that I will NOT receive the right product, but am willing to let them try.The pictures throughout the advertisement show the 5900. You even click the button to see what you are ordering close up. I suspect Lion International is the one misrepresenting the product and Amazon needs to get on board and fix the problem."
5,We LOVE the Scooba,"This little bot does a remarkable job on our wood floors, tile (yes even the grout) vinyl and linoleum floors. I first tried it on floors I had already cleaned and was shocked at the dirty water I poured out! The Scooba solution does a great job and leaves a really nice shine. Also works well with plain water or water and white vinegar. Does a great job of cleaning up spills and really SCRUBS floors. Not too much trouble to clean after use and kept on the charger it's always ready for use!"
1,Don't buy this,Thought it would do as well as my other Scooba. It does not do well at all. Too much left on the floor for my wife to accept. Leaves streaks and lines on the floor and does not get the dirt up.
4,Scooba to the rescue,"I have been very impressed the Scooba Floor cleaner. I have ceramic tile and laminate wood flooring throughout most of the house. Scooba took care of about 1000 sq. ft. of tile and even though I thought the floor was clean, the dirty water bin was quite dark when it was emptied. The best part of the scooba, I think is the low profile closeness it has with the floor. I have carpeting that butts up to the tile and I was worried about scooba getting on the carpet. But, because of the low profile, soon as scooba got to the carpet, it turned around and stayed on the tile. Give it a try, I'm sure you'll be amazed."
4,Best thing I've bought in a long time,"I don't think my floors have ever been this clean! I recommend this to anyone who has a busy schedule. There are a couple of things that you have to clean, but its WAY BETTER THAN MOPPING!!The battery that came with our Scooba only lasts for one cleaning cycle, so I suggest that you buy another battery. Have that battery charging as the Scooba is running, then you can use it on another area."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was not only a little leary about the Scooba's capability, but also with the Scooba being remanufactured. I've got to be honest, I don't remember when the floors have felt better or been cleaner. There is no sticky residue left behind and the floors dry really quickly. The Scooba doesn't leave the floors totally dry as it goes over it, but it picks up the water wonderfully. Again, don't expect the floor to actually be dry as it completes a pass. I expected that from what I read about it, but that's a little more magical than it's capable of. I love it and would buy it again. It actually made me take a second look at buying a Roomba. I bought one of the Roomba Schedulers and love it too. I have a total of 5 cats/dogs and it helps me keep up with them."
1,"Streaks, no fresh scent, loud, lame","I was disappointed in this machine. It left streaks all over my floor and it's very loud.I had to move all of my furniture anyway, I'd rather just mop myself especially so the baseboards will get cleaned.For the price I would at the minumum expect clean floors without streaks.Don't waste your money."
1,Mine Broke after 5 Months of Light Use,Mine Broke after 5 Months of Light Use. Not much recourse after 5 Months with 90 Day Warranty.
1,"Loved it at first, now terribly disappointed","I purchased my refurbished Roomba and Scooba one year ago. After nine months the Roomba failed and could not be repaired. I was offered what I thought was a great deal from iRobot. They replaced the Roomba for $170 with a new version of the same model (minus the battery and charging unit). I figured I paid what I would have paid if I bought a new one right at the start. Three months later the Scooba failed. I was told it could not be repaired but they had a wonderful deal for me. They could replace it with a new version of the same model for $170. This might be a great deal but from what I'm reading here, many Scoobas stop working in about a year. Am I really going to pay $170 every year just so I don't have to do my own mopping? I'm very disappointed. I loved the Scooba. I loved having wonderfully clean floors without having to do all the work. But perhaps I would be better off getting a little exercise and mopping my floors nearly for free."
1,How can they produce this ?,"Hi I'm an owner of several roombas an work Ok. I thougth with Scooba will be the same, it didn't work as well. Battery function well for about three times after that never held charge. I bougth another battery and never was able to held charge. I bougth an externel charger and a third battery, nothing again. No really help from Irobot. Now I have an unusefull scooba three burn batteries and an external charger. Many dolars after I ask why they produce such a deficient product.Fortunatelly Roomba is the other extreme.If somebody can give me an advise please write it.Max"
1,Bluetooth Applications Developer's Guide,"This book contains an introductory overview of Bluetooth, followed by an assortment Bluetooth topics. It was written by 3 (or 4) different authors and it looks it. It is hardly a well thought out, comprehensive approach to Bluetooth applications development nor is it an applications guide as its title suggests. Prior to reading this book I read ""Bluetooth 1.1 Connect Without cables"" and many other Bluetooth articles and papers. I was looking for a book that would pull all the information together into a useful concise applications guide. This book does NOT accomplish that."
3,Disappointed,"I had heard that this was a great CD. Unfortunatly I do not find it that great. If you want great blues guitar check out Tab Benoit, Joe Bonamassa, or Nuno Mindelis."
4,A hard to put down thriller.,This is the first book by Hunter I have read. I found this to be an intelligent thriller that was hard to put down. You find yourself pulling for swagger throughout the book. I will make it a point to read more of his works.
3,It's alright,I'm a huge Dragon ball Z fan which is why I purchased this keychain....it's a very good keychain overall but for some reason when it arrived it was EXTRA STICKY!? I have no idea why. It came straight out of the package and the back of it was covered in some strange sticky glue. It took forever to try to wash it off and even after that it's not completely clean. The ring is also really close to the top of gohans hair so I hope this holds up well and doesn't end up ripping. I'm contemplating on sending it back for a less sticky one though...
3,No Depth,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good biography of Otis, but it lacks a certain depth. It is somewhat one-sided and could have done with a lot more research and more interviews. As previous reviewers have already mentioned, would have been nice to hear from more people.What is also completely lacking is the role that Otis played in American music, american history and what he meant for the black population. There are some hints towards it, but it is never fully explored. It could have been about any artist, there is no real sense that Otis was one of the most gifted and most important soul stars.In that sense it's a little dissappointing, but to get a good overview of his life, the album is worth giving a look."
4,Freeman Does A Fine Job!,"Everything I have ever read about Otis Redding portrays him as perfect. He was a great singer, a great performer, and everybody loved him. Scott Freeman does a good job of showing a more complete Otis Redding. Sometimes Otis is surprising. He once got in complete a gun fight! The best part of the book is the research Scott Freeman did into the music scene that Otis lived in. Freeman played guitar in an R & B band in Macon, Georgia in the 1980's while writing for the Macon Telegraph and News. Many of the old musicians were still active and would sit in with the band. Freeman interviewed many of the old timers for this book, and their memories fill in the details of those times. This is a valuable book for Otis Redding fans!"
1,Nothing that great about it.,"Bad, really, really, bad. And I don't mean that in the good way. Every song sounds the same. If you want decent punk, buy a Black Flag CD.PLEASE NOTE: This is not Billy Talent!"
3,Quicken 03 Hogs Memory,"I swap back and forth between different Quicken accounts, my kids, my Mother etc. Every time I do Quicken grabs another wedge of memory and soon even with 768mb of RAM I'm into Stack Overflow and ""Insufficient Memory"" messages. Have to reboot the computer. Just be aware if you switch between several Quicken accounts."
2,not ready for action yet,"I have used quicken since 1996, for the most part i have like it. However this version is not great at all, I can not update to my bank to get my tranaction. and they{quicken} charge for support. I wish I left this one on the shelf at the store."
2,not the breeze it used to be,"I have always loved Quicken programs, but no more. Having installed 2003 Basic on my new computer a few weeks ago and hating it ever since, I am literally throwing it away and going for something new. When I said I wanted Basic, that is what I meant. Instead, the register page is so cluttered with extras, I can barely see the register and there is no way to hide the extras. The program prompts me to connect to the internet constantly and there is no way to get it to stop. It uploads, downloads, reconfigures, gives me messages that says my account balances don't match those on Quicken.com. huh? How did they get my account balances? Intuit has no real support. For example the support department is closed on weekends. I don't know about you, but that is when I balance my finances."
4,Full of Pictures.,This book has 185 photographs of various pieces of Carl Faberge's studio's work. A majority of the photos are in color. The focus is on the pieces themselves with text accompanying each picture that describes the object and lists the materials used. There is additional text that describes the generic materials used and gives an overview of the studio and the process of enameling. It also discusses the general categories of objects that the studio produced. This book is excellent for someone who wants primarily to see pictures of Faberge's work and wants some additional background information.
1,Buggiest program I've ever used!,"Horrible software! Don't buy it! What happened? Quicken used to be a pretty good program, but now it is incredibly unreliable. Every time I try to edit something it crashes the program; I need to delete the item and recreate it. All the bell and whistles are no good if the program doesn't have basic reliability!!!!"
1,Memory Hog!,This program is eating up all my Memory! Watch out and see other comments below about the same thing....There is something wrong with this program and no help from Quicken (they are the worst about taking care of the customer!)
1,Downgrade?,The failure to provide the continued use of CheckFree for bill paying negates all the other minor improvements over Quicken 2002. I have used CheckFree for many years and do not want to go through the process of converting to the flavor of the year bill paying method.
1,i'm tired of paying for support (eom),i am tired of paying intuit to help them debug their terrible products.
1,Save your money,"Luckily I bought the package with [$$$] rebate, it's not worth even [$$$]. I wanted to use it for stocks transaction processing. However, I wasn't able to see the data after downloading the file of my broker's web site. I cannot understand how companies make simple idea so complex to use till the point it becomes useless."
5,Salt Shaker Opening tip,"I just bought the item. It is a very nice shaker, but I too also had a problem initially opening the salt portion to refill it for salt. I used a rubber bottle opener to get a good grip on the clear plastic section of the unit. Don't forget to turn COUNTER clockwise to open it. Worked fairly easily after the first few openings.AS"
1,Terribly and phony,"I would give this book no stars if I could. The main character is supposed to be youngish, and yet she calmly make wise pronouncements that even the anti-female, old, stubborn characters stop and listen to in amazement before deferring to her. She is also supposed to be in love with the male lead, but there are no words or gestures of affection beyond that of a not-too-close friendship. The mystery itself was a disappointing chase that ends in an anti-climactic confrontation. Last but not least the male lead is an idiot who blunders along after Fidelma and accidentally stumbles upon answers that he doesn't understand. I finished it in the desperate hope to salvage my time spent, but I wish I hadn't. I read extensively, and this is one of the only books I have ever had such a hard time getting through from sheer boredom."
3,Good Read...until the plot was revealed.,"The book had me continuously turning pages until the underlying plot was revealed. Without giving away the secret of the drug in MIRACLE CURE, I must say that I was greatly disappointed at the highly non-technical and, I think, implausible ""solution"" to the mystery. Coming from a technical background, I had trouble suspending my disbelief when the main character finally discovers what was going on. I still gave it three stars (better than average) but couldn't recommend it to my wife who works in medicine."
3,Easy read but somewhat predictable!,"I like this writer for the most part but this was not one of her best efforts. Sorry, I found this story an easy read but somewhat predictable."
3,Two left me humming for more--Two left me wondering-Is it over?,"Darkfest by Amanda Ashley and Phantom Lover by Sherrilyn Kenyon were great. I loved them. However, Under Her Spell by Maggie Shayne and A Wulf's Curse by Ronda Thompson made me want to skip paragraphs and whole pages just to get it over with."
2,Not at all what I expected!!!,"This book was entertaining enough where I kept reading, but not enough where I would reccommend it to anyone else!!! The stories were tedious and I kept thinking, ""The next one has to be better!"" Maybe I'm spoiled, but I really expected more from these authors!! I felt like they were just meeting their deadlines on this one!!! Don't bother!!"
3,worried about Texas,"Living in the Northwest,I had some trouble following some of the local Texas language,brands,and places.The unlicensed PI, with a PhD in English Literature is at times hard to believe.Tres Navarre has to keep a country western singer's career on track,find the killer of a band member,and bed the women in the story.During the course of crime solving he gets drunk and practices tai chi frequently.There is plenty of local South Texas color,characters, crime,and crazies.The craziest being the hero's brother.This is a good read,good story,not too likeable hero for a man of the 90's.Maybe the author is trying to hard to make him tough and brainy,sexy and sophisticated. Loraine of Olalla"
2,Great characters but slow starting.,"I started out really liking this book because of the way Riordan creates characters. I liked the dialog and the way he built up a description of each person. Then, the character descriptions began to drag a little and the plot - well, there didn't seem to be enough of one and it didn't get going fast enough. I think Riordan has great promise, but I'd like to see a little less emphasis on character development and more emphasis on plot."
5,The Dukes of Hazzard Two Movie Collection,"These DVDs are great! I like it very much because is like the old Dukes adventures. they are the same actors (even Denver Pyle) and the adventure is different... I give them a 10 +.Best regards,"
5,A classical of latinoamerican literature,This is the best book of the best argentinian writer of all times.
3,"Good Stone, One Caveat","It's a good stone, does what it needs to. I use mine for maintaining and honing a straight razor. HOWEVER it is my civic duty to tell you something that Norton does not: It is *not* ready to use out of the box! For reasons beyond my understanding, The stones *do not* come out of the factory perfectly flat nor of the right abrasiveness. You have to slurry the stone with either a Norton slurry stone or a waterproof sandpaper on a flat surface. I used a 400 grit sandpaper to get it flat, then the Norton approved 600 grit (on both sides) to get it to the proper abrasiveness. I have verified this with several forums, all with people who universally have the same problem - its not ready to use as-is. Once flattened it is ready to use and lasts a while before needing to be re-slurried. I was happy with the size/weight of it, and the storage box doubles as a honing stand.TOO LONG DIDN'T READ: Good stone, does what it needs to, needs to be slurried before initial use."
4,Good entertainment value,"A Grisham novel which - surprise - predictably adhered to Grisham's tried and true legal thriller formula. Not a story that is read for deeper symbolic meaning, this novel is read for entertainment value only. In my opinion, it did a pretty good job of delivering that entertainment. And since I'm frequently in the mood to have my entertainment delivered in a mindless fashion the requires no deep cerebral exercises, I enjoyed the story and was happy to read a good, entertaining legal thriller."
4,Great read and compelling story.,"The story is very compelling and worth your time. On the cover of the paperback edition there's a quote by Larry King saying that it's the most gripping first 50 pages he ever read or something like that. That'a a bit of an exaggeration. In fact, the book starts a little slow in my view but builds up nicely. I took a star away only because the ending falls a little flat in my view. The story builds so nicely that you're expecting a ""wow"" moment, but it ends up being a little sappy. However, Grisham does some tremendous work delving into the character of Nate O'Reily. Read and enjoy."
2,Waste of time!,"Started off interesting enough, but then fell into an endless grind of pointless detail and useless information. What was the point behind this story?! The ending was non-existent and disappointing. I usually enjoy his books, but this one will not get recommended to friends and family."
5,GREAT AND GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered two novels from Amazon. THE TESTAMENT AND THE FIST OFGOD, by A.T. Nicholas. Both books are super. I read them both on myvacation and was very pleased by the plots and writing styles of these two authors. This is the first novel I read by Grisham and it won't be the last."
3,The book is mediocre for a John Grisham Novel.,"Most of John Grisham's novels have a certain level of danger present throughout the plot. His latest novel however, lacks real danger and the the plot twists that usually hurtle a reader through one of Grisham's legal thrillers. The only danger that the main character is ever in is when he catches a jungle disease. Usually, Grisham's characters are being chased by the mob or trying to avoid going to jail. There is not any emminent danger present in the novel. The novel is simply about a man trying to tack down a woman and give her money that she does not want."
1,John Grisham turns preacher,"I think John Grisham has decided to use his fame to preach to his readership so we all are ""saved"". If that is what you want, go to church because the story isn't worth it. It lacks the excitement and suspense of his other novels. The story is about a man just out of rehab who is sent to the jungle to find a missionary who leads him to God. He then proceeds to change his life and the story preaches to you over and over. Not at all on par with his other books."
2,Disappointing compared to other Grisham novels.,"I've read all the Grisham novels; I preordered this one because I've enjoyed everyone and had trouble putting them down. This one was boring and I actually skimmed some parts to ""get on with it"". The author didn't develop the characters well; the alcoholic was totally non-believable. It seemed he was trying to fit too much into one book; I would have loved to see more character development, especially of the wealthy family...there was a gold mine there. I won't rush out to buy his next book...its back to paperback for Grisham with this reader!"
2,His worst work yet.,"Grisham, like Clancy, now churns out formulaic novellas that are pumped up with predictable big plot twists that Hollywood would like. There are no heroes in this novel, just a bunch of greedy idiots and third-world bumpkins treated with equal indifference by Grisham. If this book was written by an unknown author, it will be rejected by almost all publishers, due to lack of merit. However, Grisham is now internationally famous, so he can sit back, relax, and churn out knock-off of his earlier and best efforts. Try Jim Marrs new book or for a page turner, try Brad Steiger's 'Alien Rapture', or Cobra Event or Blood Work. READ the revies."
3,"Grisham better watch out, this is two in a row.","I was disappointed with The Testament. It would have been an acceptable ""Just out of the box"" for a new author, but Grisham has given us intelligent situations and adventure. He better watch out because if his next is nothing but a rush to get a book out for $$, he'll loose most of us. The author to read is David Baldacci. He has already surpassed Grisham and he is consistently intelligent and full of original material."
2,A big disappointment.,"I have read all Grisham's books up to this one and have been so diappointed with the last two. The Street Lawyer and the Testament are real yawners. Usually I keep my Grisham novels, only loaning them out to trusted friends, but these two I quickly gave away. The Testament dragged on, the characters were very flat---either good or greedy with no interesting nuances."
3,Interesting Read - But Goes Nowhere,"It's like Grisham didn't know how to finish the book. Thesetup for conflict was there, but nothing really happens ...Believe it or not, this book would be better if it were the first of a series. I'm not saying how it ends, but if a few twists and turns are added, the follow on would be excellent. END"
2,"John, take a break!","This book was a disappointment, I think John could of done better. The plot was how this old billionaire commits sucide just after he signs a new will. An alcoholic lawyer is sent into the jungles of Brazil to find one of the old man's daughters. The book needed more action, or SOMETHING interesting. Truthfully, don't read this book."
3,A lot of fun then it fizzles,"This is a good book to read when you have a long plane ride, are going on vacation, or just have some time to kill. The book starts off strong and keeps your interest most of the way through, although the last 100 pages are a bit slow and let you down after the fun read of the first part of the book. The book is still worth the read. The strong point of the book is the main character who is interesting enough to keep you interest even when things slow down at the end. Also, I appreciated the positive and realistic portrayal of religious faith Grisham gives us. Christianity is not glamorized, but it isn't beat up on either like it usually is in books and movies. As a Christian missionary who is moving to Dourados, Brazil, I found this depiction of faith refreshing. This book can be a great read if you let it be what it should: A fun way to pass the time and keep you entertained. Just be ready for the (boring) ending."
4,Good Read,"I finished the book, so it at least gets three stars. I looked forward to reading each day, so add another one. Was it great! Nah, but I was moved by the main character accepting Christ into his life."
2,Yawn.,"The Testament isn't as bad as Grisham's last two books, but that's not saying very much. The characters are one-dimensional at best, the plot is non-existant, and, worst of all, there's no real suspense. If you want a decent Grisham book, try The Rainmaker. If you want a decent novel of personal redemption, search for a copy of Island, by Charles Abbott. But don't bother reading this book unless you feel driven to read absolutely everything written by Grisham. The publishers are obviously aware that there are plenty of people in that camp, at this point..."
1,DRY READ,This latest novel by Grisham lacked much if any excitement shared by his previous works. I would pass on this one!
2,Disappointing . . .,"I listened to the audio version of this book and found it to be so slow, boring and predictable that I couldn't finish it. Very disappointing when compared to some of John Grisham's other legal thrillers."
3,it started great and fizzled,this book started out with an excelent plot and then by the middle and definitely toward the end it fizzed out! the ending that I had anticpated in my head was much better. the one john grisham went with was very anti-climatic and blah....! the crazy kids of the billionaire were very intriguing yet he decided to focus on a recovering addict looking through the jungle for a boring character..(yes that was a very good sub-plot but the heart of the book was with the fight for the $$. the drama and humor was with the crazy a** wanna be heirs) in the end it was very disappointing.
4,"Suspenseful, thought-provoking with surprising ending.","As is common in Grisham's novels, this book was a fast and enjoyable read. The extremes in character types creates a balance against which the reader can assess his own thoughts as to the meaning of wealth and even life itself. The book's surprise ending is another Grisham trademark."
3,Not typical Grisham!,"This was an enjoyable book, and had it been written by someone else, would probably be considered top notch. But when compared to other Grisham books like ""The Firm"", ""The Chamber"", or ""The Pelican Brief"", this book was a slight disappointment. The characters lacked the depth normally defined in a Grisham book, and there just wasn't as much suspense and intrigue as we've come to expect from John Grisham."
1,The Testament,John - time to hang up the pen I'm afraid. Let real authors like Scott Turow and Richard North Patterson write the lawyer books. The Testament was one long bore.
3,Great book - but lousey ending!,"I thought this book was a great read. The plot was great and the development of the characters were good as well. I was very disapointed in the ending. You have no idea what happens to Nate? Does he become a missionary? Do the spoiled children get any of the money - do they actually settle for the 20 million? Does Rachel's will stand up in court? There were so many unanswered questions that he could have answered, I was very disapointed when I got to the last page - I thought surely there was a mistake with my book."
1,I hate John Grisham,Standard left-liberal anti-capitalist formulaic rant that proves what behavioral economists are saying about herd behavior. Go read something else.
4,Another John Grisham Classic!,"IF YOU READ THIS IT WILL SPOIL THE ENDING FOR YOU One thing that gets me is the anti climax endings that his characters always have, I'm not saying that it's bad, I liked the book and have always liked John's work but for once can't the good guy win hands down!!"
4,Good Reading,"Enjoyed this book. Had a few slow places, but most of the book was well written and kept my interest. I enjoy books that I have not guessed the ending,unfortunately I had an idea how this would end, but enjoyable reading and characters took on their own personalities. Would recommend to others."
2,A slow read.,For the first time I thought of quitting a John Grisham novel before I finished reading it. I'm glad I didn't but the first half of the book was extremely hard to get through. There was a definite pick up in the second half of the book but The Testament was my least favorite book John Grisham has written. If it hadn't been John Grisham I probably would have put it down after the first 3 or 4 chapters.
2,Not up to standard,"I have read all of Grisham's books. The Testament is my least favorite, largely because it lacks the compelling story line of his previous works. Furthermore, the character development is not nearly as thorough as you might expect of Grisham. As a result, it is difficult to feel ""in touch"" with any of the characters. Also, the book tries to deal with too many complex issues -- alcoholism, greed, the environment, probate -- and as a result, not one is fully developed. While the book is by no means ""bad,"" it did not meet my expectations."
2,Another anti- climatic Grisham ending,"I keep giving a Grisham novel another chance to revive my hope that I one again will be entralled, like i was with, A Time To Kill, The Firm even with The Partner, but AGAIN, i am dissappointed, Actually the book wasnt so bad, it had an interesting concept, a exotic locale (Brazil), but ANOTHER uneventful, boring ending."
3,Not his best but not his worst---rushed the ending,"Testament departs from Grisham's usual courtroom/law office settings. The story unfolds slowly and in detail but JG rushes us into the ending. Did he have a deadline to meet? I think this book will translate well onto the big screen---law jungle adventure. If I were casting, I'd pick Harrison Ford as Nate."
3,Grisham has done better,"I got this book hoping that Grisham would go back to the twists of plot that made Runaway Jury and the Partner excellent. Unfortunately, that was not the case, although the story was passable."
1,I can't go on anymore,"Maybe it's a good thing that I only purchased the audiotape of The Partner and that the Street Lawyer was loaned to me, because I can't spend another penny trying to make it through the stereotypical characters (100 zillion people in the law firm all stressed out, boo hoo) and predictable plots.Sorry Grisham, but fulfilling your book contract doesn't have to be this painful. But I did love The Firm."
1,more like Danielle Steele than Grisham,"Though a Grisham fan, this book was a disappointment. I felt he must have had to dash it off in a hurry. None of the intricate twists and turns. No real great characters. I thought it was more like a Danielle Steele book (and that's not a compliment), something he wrote to meet a deadline, than the usual good plot and characters."
1,"Should be re-titled ""What I did on my vacation.""",I have read every Grisham book and this one simply does not measure up. I skimmed long stretches of plotless descriptions of Brazil.
2,Disappointing!,It was hard to read the entire book. I kept waiting for the story to 'grab me' but it just never happened. Could not identify with any of the characters(nor did I care what happened to any of the characters!).
5,Great Read,"This is the first book I've ever read of John Grisham, therefore I can not compare this to his other bestselling novels. But I can say this, I could not put this down once I started reading it. The characters were very real and I found myself rooting for Nate throughout the story to overcome his problems. Another great part of this book is that is opened up a whole new world to me in the explanation of the Pantanal, and ecological region of Brazil that I had never heard of before. Thanks John, you just got yourself a new fan."
2,Not one of Grishams best by far !,"A friend lent me the book to read and though I have only read a few of Grishams novels,(mostly earlier ones)I was mildly disappointed in THE TESTAMENT. I did not care for the story line and it seemed to far fetched to believe. I guess once in a while,a dud comes out and this is the ONE!"
4,Excellent Reading,"This book like most of Grisham's work is tightly wound about law. This book is very hard to put down. It grabs you from the beginning and keeps your attention throughout. The only reason I didn't score this book with 5 stars is because the ending isn't as good as I had hoped. It finished well, don't get me wrong. I was just hoping it would end differently. You'll see what I'm saying upon reading it."
2,"Brilliant start, but no idea for the rest","Another story from Mr Grisham about the volunteers fighting for the idea and about the lawyers willing to give up their millions for this idea and I will never buy his book anymore. Great beginning with the old millionaire creating his intrigue, but then... big disappointment - there is no intrigue at all (exactly like in the ""Street lawyer""). No idea how to develop the plot. Looks like Mr Grisham has just fallen in love with the Brazilian forests and wanted to write something about that. I was reading it and waiting for something to happen and suddenly... I got to the end. Where is the plot, intrigue and suspense from the ""Pelican Brief"" or ""Partner""?"
4,An Excellent Read,"While I'm not a huge Grisham fan, I do read his stuff once in awhile, and I would strongly recommend this book for all of you who are not die-hard followers. Grisham's ability to convey the intricate and complex manueverings of the legal system to the average lay person has been a staple of his work. This time, however, he takes us on a journey to the remote Amazon forests of Brazil, with a tired, alcoholic lawyer looking for the sole beneficiary to the will of multi-biilionaire Troy Phelan, leaving her (alone) 11 billion dollars. Grisham's best ability is to convey the personal, usually selfish and greedy nature of people, and this book doesn't fail, because Phelan's loser kids all want a piece of the pie, too. What ensues is one lawyer's struggle to find the girl, which then becomes his own personal stuggle, and the standard (but very enjoyable)legal wranglings of the Phelan clan's fight for the money, A solid read, and compelling, as well."
2,Not Grisham's best,"This was an okay story - I was just expecting GREAT things after reading numerous reviews. Took this on vacation to read at the beach and it ended up more wet and sandy than read! I have read every Grisham book and have really liked most of the others, but this one was just not as good. I always feel that these books move along really well, have great characters and great stories and then just seem to fizzle to an ending. Is this just me? Worth reading, but truly not the best work by this author."
3,The Testament,This book surprised me in that there were many slow parts. I like John Grisham but this story was lacking. It went on too long in some areas and made me want to skip to the end.
2,Disappointing,"I count on John Grisham for a good read when I need an escape from my life. I found myself reluctant to bother finishing this one, though I never lost hope that it would get better. It didn't. It read like an ad for a born-again Christian church and what little was resolved at the end wasn't worth the effort. I couldn't help wondering if Grisham phoned this one in, or indeed if he wrote it at all. I understand that publishers continue to publish under a best selling author's name long after he/she dies. Maybe Grisham died and no one told him."
3,Some good points; some bad points,"I had never read a Grisham novel before this one. I absolutely loved the legal maneuvering involved -- especially Nate's tearing the greedy wannabe-heirs' testimony apart in the depositions. On the other hand, I'm surprised I got through the monotonous and contrived religious conversion of the main character, as much as I was rolling my eyes.The bottom line is that I found The Testament entertaining enough to want to sample other Grisham works; if, however, the preachiness and prayerfulness become a thread throughout his work, I'll probably never be a fan."
3,Readable but not exceptional,"It isn't Grishams best work, but all the same its readable. It lacks the speed, intensity and fervor usually associated with Grisham. But if you are reading reviews about the book then u'll most probably end up reading the book as well. U sure wont be disappointed."
2,Just as you should not judge a book by its cover...,"...you should not judge a book by its first chapter. I have seen and enjoyed the Grisham movies, so I finally decided to buy some of his books. I have two and have yet to get beyond half way through either of them without falling asleep. He always starts off with a bang and a good idea and somehow loses it from there. So far, from what I can see, apparently the Hollywood screenwriters buy his stories and fix them up from there."
3,"Mystery, Religion, Guilt and a Crazy Family.","Definitely not my favorite Grisham book, but it is still an enjoyable read. The colorful details of the family members combined with the adventure of Brazil provided an intriguing novel. The ending however was somewhat troubling for me. There seemed to be no solid resolution that came from this twisted tale of woe. I almost wanted a sequel so that I would know what happened to the rest of the characters."
3,Grisham gets his toes wet in spiritual waters.,"This book was touted as the author's course correction, a refutation of materialism worshipped by earlier characters. But the idealism of Nate is no different (or deeper) than Mitch in The Firm, or The Street Lawyer, for that matter. Testament is a passing grade adventure book, but it did not live up to its billing as a foray into things spiritual. It certainly started to do just that, but it just didn't know how to convey how Nate might have really been transformed by the proverbial Grace of God. The goodness of Rachel is marred by the innuendo of knee-rubbing and back-touching...we don't know if Nate was really touched by her spirit or just by his fantasies."
3,Hopefully Grisham's On His Way Back to Greatness,"""The Testament"" is a vast improvement to John Grisham's last two novels, ""The Street Lawyer"" and ""The Partner"", but still not in the league with his earlier works like ""The Firm"" and ""A Time to Kill"". I particularly liked the storyline dealing with the Phelan family's actions after the death of their father, this should have been developed further. I agree with other reviewers who say Grisham's description of Nate's trip through the jungles of Brazil was too drawn out for its overall contribution to the story. This material can be skimmed without much impact on the flow of the story. Finally, the Rachel Lane subplot was also interesting, but again could have used more development.Overall, Grisham has improved this time around, but he should take more time (say, two years instead of the usual one year) and write a damn good book, like we know he can!"
2,Not one of his best...,"I love Grisham, however, I MADE myself get through this book, often skimming pages. I was so disappointed--I heard on Amazon that he was bringing back several characters from other novels, and I couldn't wait to read it. This did not happen. This was definately ""OK, I read it, now what?"""
2,You want it to be the best but it is not.,You want this book to be a great adventure but it is only half a ride.You get bored in the middle and at the end you wonder if you have lost your time. Grisham has better books.
2,more like a travelogue than an adventure,This is the first Grisham book that took me a week to finish. The plot was dull and predictable; the characters sparsely and hastily sketched. Just because he took a trip to Brazil doesn't mean it's fodder for an adventure novel.I miss the twists and turns and tension I found in his last books.
1,What a waste of time!,"All right, so maybe I should have not read this book as I am obviously not the author's target market but I was curious and serves me right. No offense meant for the writer who just found a gold mine writing this type of books (he might be very good, but we'll never find out...) but this is empy ""toilette-reading"" that competes with the likes of Playboy which, at least, does not pretend to be any more than it is.The story was not only boring but soooo empty of meaning. The only value added I see in this book is the opportunity it gives us to practice our reading ability."
4,"Excellent Book, very entertaining","This is one of the best books that I've read this year. After I bought it, it was hard to put down, even though I was at Disney World! Must have for anybody who enjoys these types of books."
4,Another solid piece of work.,"Again, John Grisham can take the same old hero, in the same old situation and make it interesting. I told myself that I would not read another Grisham book that had a lawyer in it. I'm happy I gave him another chance. This was a page turner from the start with an ending that most writers wish they could develop.When can we expect another piece of work... I can't wait!!!"
5,Just Love This Book,"I have read most of Grisham's books, and by far, this is the one which moved me the most. I have read it three times now; it is a great page turner. First time I read it, I was captivated. This book provoked afterthought for me."
3,"Less frenzied, more character development","Grisham's latest is not the frenzied, fast-paced, all action,no character book of recent years. Although he remains true to his muse and focuses on a Southern lawyer with personal problems, he takes the time to let the character develop and even gives space to some introspective and insightful musings from Nate O'Riley. His protagonists (the Phelan family) are still one-dimensional, perhaps tempering their greed with some more admirable qualities would make them more interesting. Troy Phelan emrges as a comic book character without any clue as to why he would act the way he does...since the entire plot hinges on his initial action, more attention to motivation would have made a great deal of sense. Passages that take place in the jungles of Brazil and the Chesapeake cottage ring with more authenticity and depth. All in all, I enjoyed the book despite its shortcomings and found it a change in the right direction from recent Grisham offerings."
2,1st 75 pages are terrific..downhill from there..unsatisfying,"This book is a stunning disappointment from a terrific trial lawyer, whose previous books always held the reader's interest. The first 75 pages of this book are intriging and keep you on your toes, however the lenghty and totally unbelievable treks to Bolivia are verbose and I tended to skim. None of the characters, including the main character, Nate O'Riley, are interesting. Incidentally, the remaining characters, including all of the respective attorneys in this book (of which there are many)have no redeeming features. All of Grisham's previous books presented a character worht rooting for; not here. Walk, don't run to buy this book."
3,Better than last few--below standards of first three,"While this book was an enjoyable read, it falls far short of what I came to expect after his first three works--A Time to Kill, The Firm, and The Pelican Brief."
2,"Thin plot, thin character development","I normally find his books, if not particularly good writing at least entertaining. I found this piece to be particularly thin with the plot structure and the character development. I had to work hard to complete the reading of this novel. I did not know enough about the major characters and therefore did not develop any interest what happened to them. I also found all the characters to be very one-sided, either very good or very bad and that to me is not good writing. What captivates my interests are characters who a little of both, because that is what makes them complex, and that is what makes them interesting."
5,Immaculate,"The Testament was the first book I ever read by John Grisham. The novel captivated me and carried me on a pleasant journey. When it comes to books my fastidious nature sometimes forces me to overlook impeccable material. After reading ""The Testament"" I've been on a Grisham binge to read everything he has touched. If you have seen the movies this does not preclude the suspense and enjoyment you'll encounter by reading the novel. From my experience, books are often significantly better than the movie. Read ""The Testament"" you'll love it."
4,Pleasant Read,"To start with, I take issue to annmason1, who wrote the review ""Hogie Sandwhich"". She obviously has trouble with Grisham and his stories...why read him if you have so many hangups with the man's talent? I also must add that hogies down here in the south must be MUCH different than they are in the pacific northwest, because here in Dixie we pile on the meat.And to be honest, southern-boy John Grisham did the same in this book-piled on the meat. I won't go so far as to say this is better, or even in the ballpark, with ""The Firm"" and ""Pelican Brief"", but it is on par with ""The Client"", ""The Chamber"", and ""Runaway Jury"".There are moments in the book, as there are in ANY book, that people will look at as nothing but filler (or bread, as it where, since we are on this sandwhich kick at the moment). But as a whole, the story is well-written, superbly laid out, and flows easily from beginning to end.If only ALL hogies sandwhiches could say that..."
4,Grisham's 2nd Best,"The Testament is just behind The Runaway Jury. Though some would argue The Rainmaker is good as well, but I don't like its ending with an unexpected murder. What I guess is for the past couple of years Grisham has been trying hard to change his stories. No longer it's dominated by a courtroom, but the chain of events are leading the readers to a broader concern instead, from social security as described in The Street Lawyer to missonary work and a common chaplain so often neglected by his congregation as found in the Testament. It's a nice attempt. After all who will be in a better position than Grisham to try out something new in a courtroom novel. Another change in his books is that he now puts in obvious efforts to begin the story with a bang, a move perhaps to prepare for a stunning movie."
4,Good Book!,"This is a excellent book filled with action and a gripping story-line. I reccomend this book it is one that you can't put down and don't want to put down. A wealthy old man leaves his fortune to an heir that has no need for it. In the search for the missing heir a lawyer finds the true meaning of life. This is a great book, BUY IT!"
5,GREAT CHARACTERS,"I found the story quite interesting, the characters authentic and beautifully drawn and the pace invigorating...I loved it."
5,When all is said and done...,"I truly enjoyed reading this book and find Ms. Gordy-Singleton's accounts of Motown's rise and fall and her relationship with Berry Gordy accurate and truthful. Unfortunately, Berry Gordy made every attempt to destroy the careers and credibility of those artists who dared to defy him (Mary Wells, Martha Reeves, David Ruffin, Gladys Knight, Florence Ballard--to name a few) while leading his employees to believe that ""we're all in this together"" while keeping the real spoils of victory only for himself. After reading this book I find both Berry Gordy and (especially) Diana Ross utterly despicable. I strongly recommend this book to any Motown music fan as it's a definitive, well-written and extremely informative and entertaining chronicle of the label that put R&B music on the map."
3,"Berry, Me and Motown","Berry, Me and Motown was not as interesting as I thought it would be, she seemed like a woman scorned but she kept going back for more."
1,The John T. Campbell review is great !,"The JTC review is far more literate and convincing than Harvey's awful attempt at writing. I fear Harvey probably can't even spell ""irony"" so I'm obliged to believe his dross is to be taken at face value as literature!"
5,Jar Sealer,"Works very nice - we are using it to keep sour cream that we buy in bulk, split down to wide-mouth pints and for homemade bleu cheese dressing."
5,Works well and easy to use,"I'm really pleased with this attachment, as it makes it very easy, cheap and convenient to prepare items for freezing in mason jars. I use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage. Very simple to use - just fill up the jar, put a lid on, then attach this cap and remove the air with a Foodsaver machine.It works as-is with the Foodsaver line of machines (provided they have an auxiliary port to attach the hose). It also works with the Mealsaver line with a few simple modifications (need to put in an adapter so you can use the hose attachment with the Mealsaver).The mason jar lids can be reused many time provided you remove them with care from the sealed jar. I find using a screwdriver or the edge of a butter knife works well, and doesn't dent the lid.Highly recommend!"
2,Frustrated,"I hope others find this review before purchasing.(1) Regardless of whether your machine accommodates accessories, you will still need to buy the hose in order to use this tool.(2) Verify that you are using *wide-mouth* jars or buy the other version of this sealer for smaller lids (which I don't remember seeing before today). The packaging says it ""fits all pint and quart mason jars"" but it does not.For me, $8 wasted... very frustrating to get all your tools laid out for a project only to find a critical piece is useless."
2,Beware - no hose!,"I bought this, not for the jar sealer itself but to replace the pictured hose (the tip fitting which accidentally fell into a still warm toaster and melted). The hose doesn't come with it, so don't expect it (and Amazon - pls say ""hose not included""). Otherwise, if unmelted, the whole system works great."
4,Great for use with the handheld freshsaver.,"I use this with the handheld freshsaver, no need for the attachment tube it just goes straight on the top of this. I use it to seal Mason jars for almost everything, grains, sauces, choc chips - things for the freezer, fridge or pantry. It is especially good for 'salad in a jar' where if done correctly cut salad will stay fresh for over a week!"
5,Useful multi-purpose sealer,"This makes a FoodSaver more worthwhile, plus it can be used with inexpensive handheld vacuum sealers available in grocery stores-- great for camping or picnics or if you don't have a FoodSaver at all. I had been sealing jars by placing them in the large FoodSaver canister, using it as a vacuum chamber, but this cap is faster. People seem to have trouble with the standard mouth sealer cap, but this wide mouth sealer works for me every time."
1,Did not work,Didn't work even after using 2 different food savers and after several tries. I should have returned it but did not do so in time.
5,Worked well,"This is a no brainer if you have access to canning jars and already own a foodsaver. Get one, and try it, you wont be sorry."
3,Looks great,"Looks like a good product. There aren't too many rapid dissolve bath tissues on the market. Reasonably priced as well. The old school janitorial industrial brown, unbleached toilet tissue made for public bathrooms - well, haven't seen that in years. I guess the unbleached, janitorial roll paper towels are along the same line, just thinner for toilet paper. That stuff was made for public restrooms cause of kids and people put lots of toilet paper in the potty's. Plus, the TP was unbleached, and the absolute most basic, rapid dissolving eco-friendly version toilet paper of the 1970s and 1980s."
3,A bit thin for me.,"I ordered this on the subscription plan at Amazon and I love the idea. Unfortunately we now have a lot of the toilet paper that I don't like. But it is kind of a personal thing, isn't it? Anyway, too thin for me, have to use a loooong piece and if you blow your nose with it, you get TP all over your sweater. Funny writing about TP online. Paper too thin, rolls not huge, but convenient shopping."
2,Definitely 4th to 7th grade level presentation.,"Nineteen photographs included in the 48 pages are clear & interesting. Large type and presentation aimed at 4th to 7th grade level readers. Not of general appeal as information about each class of carrier too limited & generalized. ERROR. Page 32 it states that Kitty Hawk class removed from service in 1996, however, #35 million just spent on rennovating the USS Kitty Hawk & it is definitely in service, stationed in Japan & last week depoyed to Baltic area."
4,Daddy digs it,"When purchasing this bag, I was looking for something that was practical, and would meet my husbands seal of approval. My son is only 12 days old, so we have only used it a handful of times, but the bag is able to hold all of our necessities with easy access (especially the wipes). My husband likes it, mostly because it doesn't look or feel like a diaper bag."
2,Dull And Detailed,"I've been listening to it on audible, very detailed descriptions with lots of names but presented in a non-interesting way, not a storyline as such just a description. If that's what you want it might be great."
3,"Long read, mildly compelling","I think the first professional review Amazon lists has it dead on in terms of acessing this book. The writing is fairly clunky and the characters are skimmingly drawn (ie. beautiful, but duplicitous; stoic but thoughtful). The writer is in need of a good editor (it's very long for the story it tells) and for a historian, the author's characters speak in a very 21st century manner and behave as such, too. There's something a little Victorian to the book (and, as someone mentioned, Caleb Carr-ish), but nothing really Regency. It's an admirable effort to pen such a tome, and have the discipline, but I'm not really tempted to read the follow-up ""prequel"" either."
5,Kentucky Heat,I love the Fern Michaels books and this series of 3 didn't fail. Very easy reading. I finished this series and am looking forward to the next series.
2,Well that was depressing.,"WHOA THERE. UH UM.. OK. Stutter, Gulp & Yuk. The only thoughts I have about this book would be massive spoilers. If you loved Star By Star you'll love this. In Dark Empire, Leia saved Luke from the dark side, so it can happen. But I fear history may repeat itself and balance is about to be restored.. again. This is not why I read Star Wars novels.Quoting Robert Mc Adams - It is rather depressing how the Star Wars universe is being portrayed right now, and frankly, if this series continues on the arc it is going -- it will have killed the universe I have loved to read about for so long -- leaving me with no reason to continue reading about it.Hope or Hopeless - We will have to see where they take this story arc. We have the makings of a new three way rebellion.Aaron Allston - there is little of the sense of humor well got in previous Allston Books.Audio Book - The switch to 6 hour abridgments is great. The overall production is excellent."
5,The Perfect Extrawide Index Dividers!,These dividers are great and just the right size for organizing 8.5 x 11 papers as they are larger than the usual index dividers. Perfect!
3,Not bad,"This program is fun, but basically it's Microsoft Word with a password. There aren't a lot of fun design features like I hoped, but if you have some nosy people around you, this is a great way to keep documents or diary entries hidden"
2,Seligman Leaves the Reader Dangling,"While I found the book completely engaging from beginning to end, I couldn't help but think that there's something ""off"" about the author (at points, his interest in Sontag and Kael borders on sociopathic -- what's this about him having ""many opportunities"" to meet Sontag, and not wanting to? Is he afraid of her?). Craig Seligman is an excellent writer, but only a so-so critic. He draws the reader in with his enthusiasm for his subjects, but leaves the reader dangling... The book, it seems, he wrote for himself. You have to be in his head to get the full picture of his obsession. And I wonder what Sontag and Kael would think of him."
3,"First try at Nouwen, won't be the last","This was the first Nouwen book that I have ever read. I thought he was able to describe the destination of the spiritual journey, but for me the book lacked the concrete directions on how to get from one place to another. There were moments that I became excited with anticipation that I was going to receive what I was looking for, but overall I left disappointed. It won't be the last Nouwen book I read."
4,Great pick up,Great book but amazing service. Got the book in a very timely matter and I was very happy with my service
5,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes","[...]I really do not understand why Will Haven never got the attention they deserved. Crap bands like Simple Plan get plenty of attention, and yet bands such as this don't, really. I guess that's the way of the world. If it's catchy, then it's good. But make a person actually try and THINK when they listen to the songs themselves, and it becomes too much. MTV can't handle it, they rarely play any videos and if they do it's mostly (c)rap and other gibberish. These guys actually have talent and if you have a good and un-poserish ear for music, check Will Haven out."
3,Nice format but truly just for starters,"I'm not going to re-write what some of the other reviews have talked about in detail such as the format.I'm just going to add that the book is well designed and useful IF you are JUST beginning in Japanese. I liked the layout and thought I could use it as a everyday dictionary (I live in Japan) but there are no entries for many of the basic words I want to look up.Fair enough, I mean, they called it a starter's dictionary. It just turned out to be way simpler than I had expected.So buy this if you are a beginner and want to use it to study, but do not buy it if your Japanese is any higher than that or if you are looking for a small general purpose Japanese dictionary."
4,Very useful,"I am a new leaner of japanese study by my own and i find this dictionary very helpful. I gives you explainations and meaning of the respective katakana and hiragana word.There's only 2 things that I was expecting but it was not delivered in this edition, well its starters edition.1. There isnt kanji list but there's kanji associated with almost all words.2. There's not pronouciation help with the words, you can check the hiragana and katakana list at the back but you need to turn front and back for it. They should have""ai"" meaning, explaination, kanji writing, pronouciationBut overall, it's a good guide for learners. worth buying. :)"
2,disappointing companion to the GOF bible,I have found the examples and discussions in this book to be lacking when compared to those from the GOF book. I bought it to have a reference of examples and implementation details for Java but I always find myself going back to GOF to code up a Java solution from their excellent explanations.I would not recommend this.
2,It simply didn't work for me.,"Seeing the other favorable reviews already posted here, this book obviously works for some people. I guess it all depends on what you look for in a science fiction book. It left me cold. Barton's writing style was too terse and austere for me - often starting a paragraph with a sentence fragment, and blowing through scenes with too little detail (unless there is anything sexual in it, which he never fails to mention). There was too much of the weird and surreal for my tastes, and I felt too emotionally distanced from the characters, especially the protagonist, to care much what happens to them. There were a lot of good ideas in here, but not all of them work well together and the presentation left a lot to be desired."
3,A little more plot please...,"This was an interesting read, the first of this author's works I've picked up. There were a number of great scenes in this book but they seemed disjointed, with the characters floating between them in a happenstance way. I wish the author had put more effort into the plot and less into describing the genitalia of the female characters."
5,A wonderful book from an underrated author,"I like Wm. Barton's solo-authored novels very much, and don't know why he isn't a bigger name. He deserves a wide audience. If you haven't tried him yet, this one's a good place to start."
5,3rd Med--The Life of a Gonzo Company Commander,"It's obvious that a leader such as George (Shack) Robinson was a benefit to the U.S. Army, as evidenced by his approach to his duties as a company commander in the 3rd Medical Battalion, 3rd Infantry Division, in Aschaffenburg, Germany, beginning in l974. His use of humor, discipline, and dedication in his job made serving with him both an honor and a pleasure. Hope he's doing well.Bullet Bob Strain6808 S. Roslyn CircleCentennial, Colorado 80112-1219303-741-3503"
4,Great low volume mask - for underwater hockey!,"I use this mask for underwater hockey only (Go MN Loons!); im not a free diver, nor do I scuba (much). Wide view angle, low profile avoids snagging. I paired it with a modified Omersub snorkel (cut short), and polypropylene webbing 3 pt mask strap - great for keeping it on my face, where it belongs.Possible downsides:Plastic lenses will scratch (solution: keep it in the included case!) and possibly pop out or leak (not yet, but I hear it happens).Low volume means little to no protection of the nose and nose bridge in the event of a fin to the face. bruising likely.I forgot to shave last time I wore the mask during practice and I suffered some leaking... the seal is pretty flexi."
3,"Enjoyable, but not Iris Johansen's best work","This novel is a decent read, but too long for the plot and its resolution. Kate Denby, the central character, as a previous reviewer mentioned, really is too young to realistically have made it where she is in her career and her life.Also her wishy-washy fastasizing between Noah and Seth goes against the grain of the rest of her personality, which is portrayed as very determined and clear-headed.Finally, the character of the man who is stalking her is simply ridiculous and doesn't ""fit"" within the framework of the story. Perhaps that was the author's intention: in a novel of modern science and conspiracies, to have a very spiritually ""evil"" villain, but it just doesn't work.I am a big fan of Iris Johansen, but this novel, while mildly entertaining, was not up to her typical cutting-edge, mysteries with crisp well-defined and realistic characters."
4,"A sweet story, but not my favorite",This was sweet and quick read about two people with very different backgrounds. Georgette is the typical rich hairess who has it all and still wants more. Bob is the great guy with the perfect family who feels like George won't be able to love him. Although the book was very sweet I found it rather predictable. Still it had a sweet ending and if you have read the first book then you may want to read this one because it picks up about Adrain and Celeste.
4,A good experience,"This is an enjoyable game with quick-to-pick up controls and consistent visuals. The voice acting has a certain charm to it, not bad and yet kind of ""obvious"" acting. It brings out a nostalgia factor by playing similarly to older action/adventure fantasy titles. The conversation choices are presented in a somewhat awkward manner, and the UI feels a bit cluttered when navigating by Xbox controller, but that's all I've got for cons. They aren't game-breaking. In fact, it's running fine on Windows 8.The game box says it features copy-protection, but I can't see any. It installed and launched without a hitch, so I'm guessing the copy protection is just weird disk sectors to prevent creating an image of the DVD. After having a series of bad experiences with DRM on major titles, it's refreshing to see a more trusting approach."
1,Terrible Product,"The paper is cheap and when you print off the images they look cheap.The perforations hardly even work.They don't even provide a downloadable file with the proper template. In the instructions, you are told to print a copy on white paper and then HOLD IT NEXT to the avery paper to see if it will copy correctly. I could hardly believe it.Total waste of money."
2,"Great jacket cover, but....","I was disappointed with this book. It is not an easy book to read and keep you motivated to read more. The statistics that are quoted you probably have seen before, so nothing new there.He did make one point that I liked and that is No one has every become very rich by saving their money. He then goes on to explain this statement further."
2,"Yeah, um...","I'm sorry, I must have missed the Waiting to Exhale party about the excitement of this book. The last time I checked, the ONLY way to make sure you have the right mate, rather he be a millionaire or working a 9 to 5 is to trust in God. This is a silly and juvenille waste of time."
5,"Good resource, great stories","I recently read Daughters of Islam: Building Bridges with Muslim Women. A look at the diverse cultures of Muslim women; from the liberated and politically active to the resourceful women in Baudouin tents and how their surroundings contribute to who they are. They too have passions, fears and confidence. You'll find, like I have, that they are not very different from us.This is a great resource as well as an enjoyable book full of individual stories of various women who call themselves Muslim.Many of these women also share their stories of meeting Jesus. Who influenced them and how He ultimately revealed that He is the way, the truth and the life, to some of these women in a unique way for each.It challenged me to treat others how I want to be treated and to see through eyes behind the veil. My past tendency has been to only see the differences and dismiss the stories, the hearts and the real people who deserve connection and love."
1,This is bad!,"1st I would like say the only reason I even picked up this cd is because I thought they where some band like GWAR. I have been into GWAR for over 15 years, so to see something like that I thought I will give it a try. Went home put it in and the cd intro track was ok. After that it just went bad! Really really bad! If it wasn't for them looking like GWAR I would never have got this cd. All the songs are really lame and sounds like something you would hear from the 50's or 60's as far as the words but the music sounds like copper but much much gayer. I really don't see why anyone likes this crap. If you want some real music check out GWAR, Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dissection, etc. Don't waste your money on this."
2,So where's that sword after all?!,"A story in the tradition of the Conan series, only without the ""Barbarian"" added to the hero's name.Disgraced in the war , Yourdon is forced to make a new life for himself. After being exiled by his own father, fallen to drinking and then saved in extremis by allying himself with a merchant, Yourdon finally finds a new job: mercenary bodyguard. A series of assignements end up with an accusation of murder against his liege, a self made prophet. Yourdon gets saved then revenges himself.Very good technique, no surprises, no clear ending... And no sword of the prophets that I could read about in the whole book.Where's the sword? Was there any sword? What's the catch??Or is there any?...."
5,The Complete Metalsmith,This gently used book is great! It will be an invaluable asset for me. The shipping was exactly what was promised. Thanks Amazon.
5,Helped me a lot.,Book covers all the basics and more. I learned a lot from it and use it as a base for many different types of jewelry that I make. It's well written and can be used by beginners and the more experienced metalsmiths.
2,unsatisfied customer,I was not happy with this item.It was supposed to smell like lavender which helps calm you down and help you sleep.I did not smell lavender and it did not help me sleep.
4,Sea Monsters Reviewed,"Now, this film kept my interest up during the whole film. I really like it!! I was only vaguely awary of some of the creatures mentioned. I knew about the Megasaurs from other films I've watched. I think anyone who wants an idea about what the seas were like back then would enjoy this film a great deal as I have."
2,"Too many people, too few monsters.","Anyone looking for for a variety of ""sea monsters"" is going to be disappointed. In the whole film there is exactly one, a large reptile. Otherwise there are dolphin ancestors that are not particularly monstrous and fish. Worse is the constant shifting between effect images and archaeologists and fossils. Personally I hate talking heads in nature films, and this one has too many. The film is short and is pretty low on content. The blu-ray transfer is ok, but it is the sort of thing you can see on TV every week, so why bother with the purchase?"
5,A must-have for hardcore fans,"Frank Black/Black Francis is one of the most significant artists of the last 25 years and is still making incredible music with his latest band. These 2 discs are really an oddity, but for any hardcore fan they offer unique musical perspectives on some of the most classic Pixies stuff ever. Yes, the first disc is much more lively interesting, a rare sonic insight into early Pixies. But the second disc will sneak up on you as well if you love the songs."
4,Quickset Grill,"The grill works great. It was easy to set up and install the propane. The heat is high enough for a low-end grill. We have used a much more expensive grill, but dollar for dollar this grill keeps up. Our only issue was that the grill box was missing many of the parts. Char Broil customer service was, however, excellent and shipped the parts out immediately."
4,"A bit of a predictable ending my dear, but you gotta love it",The Scorpio Illusion worked like magic for me. A good spy novel that held my interest over the three days it took me to read it. Maybe it was the countess that kept me going -- I don't know. Great for guys living of the coast of Florida with a bit of time on their hands. The snorkel will still be there once you have finished the novel. Get it!
4,Ludlum has not lost his touch,"I have read many of Robert Ludlum's books, including all of the ""Bourne.."" adventures. This is one of his best. The plot is a stretch and there are a few errors in his research. Pilots don't call their instrument panel a ""dashboard"". But the characters are fun. The hero Tye is believable. The pilot who runs a brothel is really funny as is Tye's sidekick Pohl. The lead bad girl Amaya is full of surprises. In fact the whole story is so full twists and surprises you don't know what is coming next. It just took my breath away. I couldn't put the book down. I read it in two days."
1,Not so great,It is very difficult to put on. I have normal skin yet it always tells me my skin too dry. You can't put lotion on to moisten your skin.
3,"The old ""Freddy's Nightmares"" series pilot","When I came across this some time ago, it took me down memory lane. I remember when this was a series on FOX-25 back in the day. This was actually the pilot episode, directed by Texas Chanisaw Massacre director Tobe Hooper.This series actually went more for the horror than the comedy we were used to from the Nightmare movies. I always liked the feel of the series because it had a very eerie feel to it. While I never caught this episode in its days on television, I looked forward to seeing it.""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" shows the supposed origin of Freddy Krueger. He is a child murderer, found not guilty, due to the police forgetting to read him his rights. He eventually returns to terrorize the children in their sleep. This episode contradicts a lot of what has been explained about Krueger in the film series but is still worth adding to your collection if you are a die-hard Nightmare On Elm Street fan."
2,Not for breezy conditions,"The rainfly on the Tetragon 8 that I received was the problem. It has two shock corded short poles to hold the rainfly above the doorway, and above the rear window. By Day 2 of a 7 day camping trip, after a brief summer storm with slight wind, the poles had broken out of their little sleeves and torn small holes in the rainfly, causing the doorway overhang to fall over the door. The back window situation was a little better in that the poles didn't completely break through. That said, the tent did not leak, which is the only reason I'm even giving it a 2. The tent is useless to me now, and I will not make the mistake of purchasing another Eureka with such a flawed design. I am a veteran camper, and have other tents. I was hoping the Eureka, as a lightweight tent, would offer me a viable and economical alternative. It did NOT."
2,OUCH,"First couple times wearing these sandals hurt like crazy. The support piece along the back strap cut the skin right at ankel level on both of my feet. I have since cut that piece off of the back and the sandals are now fine, but I wouldn't recommend buying a shoe you're going to have to mutilate just to keep from injuring yourself."
3,Characters not developed enough to be true Binchy,"I liked her departure from her usual. But for me, Maeve Binchy's strength is her development of characters in her stories. The short stories just didn't allow that. I enjoyed the stories, but wasn't overwhelmed like I usually am at her work."
2,If the stress of Christmas doesn't depress you enough ....,"Maeve Binchy books are typically a delightful reading experience. I can't say that about this one. It was a downer. Very disappointing. If this had been my 1st Maeve Binchy book, it would have also been my last."
2,Will not fit a dive boot,These are TOO Freaking narrow to fit a dive boot. I bought these to swim in a Lagoon (not a pool) and to get in and out requires walking over a lot of coral so dive booties are a must. I thought an open heal fin (like in a dive fin) would accomodate a dive bootie. I was wrong.The pros: they are fine without a bootie. I wear a size 11 and the XL fits snug but ok. So if you don't need a dive boot then these are fine.
4,Good flippers,Excellent for kids. Split fin design is easier on the hips and hip rotation. Strap at the back makes it adjustable as kids grow.
1,far from been a masterpiece...,"one word describes this work: BORINGthis is even much more boring than the last two albums from the gathering, and I always think that will be impossible.What happen with them after alternative 4?? ahh... Duncan Paterson left the band..."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"A major headache from beginning to end.First, the lousy instructions for product registration require 2 codes that aren't clearly identified as to which is for the product and which is for network play, so you have to guess each time you get the very obscure error message about invalid codes.Next, don't bother using the game unless you download and install the patch because it is so slow you can write your own software in between moves. Of course, once you do get to play the game at ""normal"" speeds, it will crash on you without warning (or any error message/logging for corrective action).Finally, if their server is down, your game won't load at all, even if you only want to play it on your Mac and not the network.This game was written by a bunch of amateur hackers that have no clue as to how to develop professional, user-friendly software. If you like that kind of product then go ahead and buy this; otherwise, avoid it like the plague."
2,Trust,I read Trust. That's number 11. It's full of action. There are a lot of bad words in this book. There were martial arts and kung fu in it.
4,Easy Rider,"We have used this stroller/car seat combo for 4-5 months now and absolutely love it. It seems to have some pretty rugged shock absorbers on it. We go for a lot of walks, and not always nice terrain, and it seems to handle quite a bit.There are a lot of wonderful features, storage, cup holders and a fold down basket underneath. Our only complaint is that the fold down basket on the bottom doesn't exactly fold down easily. It's actually a pain to get down, but overall we really love the stroller and car seat.They are quality items!!!"
3,NIV Life Application Bible,Nice Bible but I was disappointed that Jesus' words were not highlighted in red. I bought three and gave them as gifts.
2,Disappointed,Item arrived quickly as advertised. No documentation in box. Right side burned out within two days. Left side still works though very slowly. Very disappointed.
1,Bad buy,"Black & Decker 5106551-20 CHARGER,DUAL 24VOLT - This charger was maild in a box, not shrink waped. It killed one of my battries and made the other one useless in half charge status. I could be unlucky one, B&D is good company and they normally make good products!"
2,Not as good as it could be.,"This MP3 player is a low cost alternative to better known brands. I purchased two for my sons as their first MP3 player. It took awhile to figure out how to get it working but I expected that based on personal experiences of friends. I consider myself technically capable and was able to figure out how to get songs from RealPlayer to load into the MP3. However, the construction of the player that holds the battery is not built to last. Even so it should last until my kids are older and these players can still be used as jump drives."
1,Complicates everything further,"Well, this book didn't work for me at all. Everyone I know who have read this book all say ""well, good book but I never really got into practicing the meditation-stuff"". And that is understandable. It is so complicated and I doubt very much that it will give you more than a temporary, superficial recovery. I tried the meditation, bought a tape-recorder with a microphone and all and really tried hard, but to no avail. I do not recommend it. I wish you good luck if you try it though. I think you might need it."
4,Un lector de Salta-Argentina,"Debo decir que como fanático del Titanic me ha gustado mucho este libro, principalmente por sus impresionantes ilustraciones y fotos inéditas, aunque con respecto al texto me parece que hay libros más completos acerca del Titanic. La encuadernación y los colores son realmentes dignos de destacar, si se quiere este libro podría ser algo así como la Biblia del Titanic. Una fascinante historia contada por profesionales y expertos en el tema.-"
3,The book is great but not sure who had it when I bought it.,"This is a great book but when I got it, it was faded and yellow like it had been on someones bookshelf at home for years and then they decided they did not want it and sold it. It was also damaged at the corners."
4,Good tent for good weather,"Inside of the tent is great. Spacious, lots of ventilation, etc. The rain fly sucks. Most of the tent isn't covered, so I'm highly skeptical of people staying dry in a decent storm. Also, our fly ripped when a dog with bad eyesight ran full speed into one of the ropes that tether the fly to the ground."
5,A really great tent at a great price!,"This tent is a fabulous deal. I can't believe it comes at such a low price. I purchased this tent and used it this week. It was a breeze to set up. I've had other dome tents that were smaller but had more poles. The tetragon has 2 main poles and 2 secondary poles. Took my husband and I about 10 minutes from the time we had it out of the box. The real test, however, was when it poured rain most of the night on Sunday. We were quite concerned about leakage as we had not sealed any of the seams at home. By morning there were 2 small puddles (4-5"") at the bottom of each side door zipper. I think if we seal that area, it would be leak free. The tent is rated to sleep nine, but I think that would be quite crowded. Figure about 7 adults maximum. We had five with room for all of our duffles. As stated before, a great tent at a great price."
5,Eureka is a quality tent name - but there is some prep work,"I have had great sucess with the many Eureka tents I use personally and also with our Boy Scout troop (and these boys abuse the tents). It sounds like some people buy the tent and bring it on their campout. Tents should be assembled prior to camping to get a feel of how to set-up and take-down. Also when it is set up in your yard you can do the most important task - water proof the seams to prevent leaking. Most tents must be seam sealed to prevent leaks, campers know this, first timers may not. I have the Tetragon 12x10 and many others that have weathered many storms."
3,wats the name of that song plzzzz help,"oi everyyyyyyyyyyyone help ME! yous know that song right at the start just before the main menu comes up, its like opera or mozart stuff then it goes into hard rock.. and it plays again just before the wet t shirt contest! i luv it, but its not on the end credits or on the soundtrack. whats the name of it????????????????!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Quality Sound,"I have my NTG2 connected to a Canon GL2 through a Beachtek XLR adapter, and I think this mic sounds pure and true. In fact, when I monitor my sound it doesn't even seem like I'm listening through the mic. I've used Audio-Technica's AT897, and though it is a decent microphone, I believe that NTG2 is the better choice. Besides the great quality sound, here is a list of why I like it so much:-Wonderful super-cardioid pick-up pattern-Well functioning bass roll-off switch (for excessive wind)-Phantom or battery power-Max sound input @ 131dB (AT897 only 115dB on battery power)-Very DurableThere are some things I don't like:-The battery life is not nearly as good as the AT897-Need to use a flat-head screwdriver for bass roll-off switch-Brand sticker is coming off-Wind screen is just OKThe stock wind screen isn't going to be that great any shotgun mic. And the bass roll-off switch is made to prevent accidental switching. Just keep an extra AA battery in your bag and you'll be happy."
4,"Well made, warming up to it","I am running this on a Panasonic HMC150. Sound quality is good, but I'm disappointed in how much it picks up from behind the mike. I was really expecting something much more directional."
2,An exercise in self-pity,"This books suffers a bit too much from the author's chaotic musings about anything that just happens to pop into his mind. Based on notes he made in the field during World War II, the author spends too much time revisiting his every thought instead of describing what was going on. The book does provide a fairly good perspective of a well-educated infantryman in the war if you are willing to skim over page after page of annoying ""holier-than-thou"" philosophizing. But what is worse about this book is the pervasive atmosphere of self-pity that the author exudes. I sometimes get the impression the author feels that destroying Nazi Germany wasn't worth the effort because it was too much of an inconvenience on his personal life."
3,Ho-hum.,"I loved ""Point of Impact"" and was excited to see a sequal on the shelves. What a disappointment. Bob Lee Swagger acted completely out of character and most of the other characters were just annoying. The story was stilted and slow."
1,"Sadly, nothing but trouble","I have used Norton SystemWorks for years, so in spite of the bad reviews on Amazon, I upgraded from 2005 to 2006. My experience was extremely disappointing. Immediately after installing, my computer became very sluggish, as suggested in the other reviews. Then it wouldn't boot. I was unable to return to a previous setting, because Norton Ghost had established a new baseline and all old set points were gone. After considerable aggravation, I got my machine to reboot (H zd7000 w/XP) and uninstalled SystemWorks. But I thought it couldn't possibly be SystemWorks. So I cleaned up the machine and reloaded the software. Once again, wouldn't boot except to Norton Ghost screen but had NO set points to revert to. Once I got my machine to boot, I removed it again. Now I am going to buy McAfee virus protection and use the Microsoft system tools. Too bad. Always liked their program, but it's not worth the trouble."
2,"Resource hog, more trouble than help","I've used Norton Systemworks for years, but the 2006 version made me reconsider whether to ever touch a Symantec product (well, except for Partition Magic). NSW 2006 Premier is just a resource hog. My memory usage jumped by several hundred megs. I tried to shutdown services that I didn't want to run, but it would not let me. Then I tried to unistall the whole suite from an admin account - no luck, even in Safe Mode. The only way to get rid of this thing is by downloading a special utility from Symantec's website. Avoid this product. I know I will.PS: The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1, is that it has some useful utilities inside, like One-Button Check."
1,dont buy this piece of junk..... and sh..,"it has been 3 months since i have been using this idiotic product.i dont know what made those morons to release this product. at last i have come to a conclusion that THIS IS NOT AN ANTI-VIRUS PRODUCT, IT IS A VIRUS ITSELF,. Each time I start my computer have to wait fo 15 to 30 minutes to start my work. And above all this junk cant uninstall itself. When i tried to uninsall it tried for 15 minutes only to give me groundbreaking news that ""error cannot uninstall"". You only have to be in my situation to know how i felt. please dont buy this one, unless ofcourse it you want to voluntarily complicate your life and your beloved pc.these symantec people are simply fooling people by making a very substandard and senseless products."
1,What a joke,"I ordered this program to download onto my computer from the symnatec.com website. It didn't download, so I followed their instructions to troubleshoot, which didn't work either. I then called customer service (which was a long distance call) and was put on hold. After 45 minutes, I hung up and just completely erased everything and filled out the form for a refund, which I should have received by now, but they keep sending me e mails saying I need to fill out the form (which I did). I checked with the BBB, out of 119 complaints, 42 were due to refunds/exchange issues, by far the majority of the complaints. The next leading complaint was customer service with 24."
3,"A mixed bag, as the title suggests","When drummer Dave Mattacks decided to make a little money going on tour with someone more popular, Fairport Convention decided to go the ""Unplugged"" route, with guitarist Maartin Allcock and bassist Dave Pegg going acoustic (Allcock plays bouzar, which I presume is related to the bouzouki, on much of the album) and no drums. The first half of the album was done in the studio, and includes James Taylor and Loudon Wainwright covers. The ballad ""Lalla Rookh"" is a highlight. The second half of the album is live, and many of these songs were done better by the same lineup on ""In Real Time - Live '87"". The live portion includes another Wainwright piece, the entertaining ""The Swimming Song"". This album seems to complete Fairport's decline from a rock band to a folk ensemble, especially when singer Simon Nicol continually explains to the live audience ""and that's the chorus.""(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
2,Not what most theatre buffs would hope for,"As one of the last important figures in 20th Century musical theatre, Tommy Tune was part of many important shows. One would hope his autobiography would include at least some insight into his performing and directing techniques -- but such is not the case here. As for his personal life, Mr. Tune shares a great deal -- but it is hard to rely on the frankness of someone who seems to change his sexual preferences as easily as most of us change clothes. And the chapter discussing the woman he wronged but refuses to name is so obvious in who it refers to that the author's sincerity rings false. Some interesting anecdotes and photos not found elsewhere, but overall a great disappointment."
2,N64 like game for xBox,"Didn't play it alot, but it is like an early version of Gand Theaf Auto. Some cool thing about this game are the maps and the possibility of jump between buildings, still in a N64 graphics. :D"
5,nice,"this game is pretty much the same as a grand theft auto game but, it has online which makes it a lot funner. you can play with a friend and take down the bad guys or you can just pretty much do anything the hulk does like why not pick up a car and throw it at your friend? it is a great game. highly recomended"
3,Fun but really stupid.,This is a very brainless fun game. Good for killing some time when you want to destroy some stuff. Not great by any means... but fun.
4,Fun with repetition,"This game was pretty fun, if you haven't played this game and can get it for $10 it's not bad. You get to build your character, basically you can jump higher run faster, get bigger guns and cars to keep it a little more interesting. I had fun with this game, it will get boring because you basically run around trying to take over territories.The map is pretty large. I would recommend picking up the crackdown 2 over this one, because there is more variety of things to do in the second game.I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a fun game. I like open - non linear - games where you can mess around and then do stuff when you feel like it. The physics are pretty fun, jumping around with the agent. It's more of an arcade type grand theft auto."
2,An overpriced Halo 3 Beta patch,"This game is just another bad shot at trying to attempt to make a good GTA clone.Storyline is boring. Not really any story at all. Just stuff that looks like a story to make up for an excuse for all the excess violence.Graphics felt like they more for the PS2 than the Xbox 360.Also like another person commented on. Too many Live Marketplace content that should have been included into the game disc. Sorry, Microsoft, but please start shipping us the ""WHOLE"" game instead of taking stuff out right before release so you got some download content on Live. At least make it free if your going to insist on taking it out of the game disc. Some of us gamers don't appreciate getting nickeled and dimed to death with bogus Live downloads."
5,Crackdown aka Beatdown,"This game is awesome, provided hours of entertainment.Pros:Awesome Gameplay, superheroesque..Halo 3 inviteLots of side missionsCons:AFter beating the game, all you do is go around and kill ramapant gangs.Not enough terrirtory, they should have had 5 islands."
2,Where are the answers,Seems like they ran out of good ideas a few books ago. Most of the answers went around in circles and never really got to the point.
4,Beginner Clarinet Book,"This is a beginner's book that really starts with the basics, like assembling the parts of your instrument and the basic finger positions and notes. There are complete finger charts in the back. Just what we were looking for so our child can get a little fun summer experience before starting in band come September!"
5,The best hanging file label you'll ever find.,"I've been using Avery Worksaver Tab Inserts for 10-15 years. They come in 1/3rd & 1/5th cut. I typically use the 1/3rd cut. They slide into the plastic tab that attaches to a hanging file folder.But best of all, these can be printed in your printer. And that is what I like best about them. Makes finding the file you are looking for, a lot easier."
1,Guidebook for the He-Man Woman-Haters Club...?,"I read this a long time ago, when it was published in the ""Loveswept"" series. I really looked forward to reading it because I had enjoyed other books by Sandra Brown, but in this one the ""hero"" was awful! He kidnaps a woman and her son, possibly placing them in danger, certainly causing the woman much torment and humiliation, and this is supposed to be a ROMANCE novel? Get real! I expected Hawk to grab the heroine by the hair and drag her back to his cave! Ms. Brown is great at romance; her novels are always very steamy. But get with the program! Woman who read ""contemporary"" romance novels aren't happy with this type of ""hero""! I read this book several years ago, but it still irks me so much that I had to submit this review. Pass on this one, even if you're a big Sandra Brown fan."
3,"Once again this story left me feeling flat, and disappointed","I felt there could have been more spark Hawk and his captive. There were some funny moments. But in the end I had an ""OH Well"" feeling not a ""WOW"" feeling"
2,"""A woman's place?!!""","I couldn't believe while I was reading that this book had been bought for more than 10 thousand people! Such a waste of money and time that I had to say something to prevent other ""innocents"" like myself from buying it. I found the story plain and irrealistic, and awfully chauvinistic. I almost yell when the ""hero"" tells Miranda ""woman! stay in your place"" and then adds ""which is beneath a man"" Please! What is worst is that the story is placed in modern times, not in the middle age; and the female character, a single parent, a modern and working gal, accepts this kind of treatment without hesitation. What is more, she falls for it! Furthermore, I found the ending dangerous because it encourages young or candid people to believe that it is really easy to ""negociate"" with the goverment and get away with a felony; and also easy for the author who obviously didn't spend much of her time figuring out how to wrap up and sell it."
5,Hawk O'Toole's Hostage,"I enjoyed reading this book. At first I didn't like hawk because of how he acted. But once I understood his point of view, it became clear that all he wanted was to make amends for his father's wrongs. This book kinda has a way of telling the readers that love can find anyone, anywhere, anytime. I would recomend it to all my friends and family."
1,Not worth the $$$$$,Don't waste your money. Not user freindly. After two days don't care if I ever play this game again. I'll go back an play Hunting unlimited 3. The best hunting game I have found to play.
1,ludlum at his worst,"inane doesn't begin to describe this hopelessly tired retelling of a theme best laid to rest. disappointing on its best day it is truly sad to see how far a once spectacular writer has sunk. ludlum's recent health problems seemed to have drained him of any ability to produce a complex plot line. his characters are not believeable, the dialogue worse than one would find in a romance novel. if this is what we can expect from him in his ""declining"" years, i say please stop him before he writes agai"
2,Disappointing - even for fans,"I am a big Robert Ludlum fan, having read all 18 of his novels published (under the name Ludlum) before 1997 - except The Road to Omaha.The Apocalypse Watch reads as though it were written by a screenwriter. The plot moves swiftly, and is carried by the dialog. However, there is a conspicuous shortage of descriptive prose. Locations, buildings, scenes, and persons are usually described in one short paragraph. That leaves little room for local color, atmosphere, or character development.The Apocalypse Watch is a big disappointment for this Ludlum fan. I can't recommend it."
5,8 year old reader who loved this book,It was awesome!!!!!!! The book is about when a spoiled little girl meets a smart little pig. What will happen? Read the book and find out.
2,David Lanz Finding Paradise,"Other reviewers rated this as ""classic David Lanz going back to his roots"". I disagree. I found this sub-standard compared to his other CDs. Painting the Sun was far superior."
3,Elton goes disco,"So why did Pete Bellotte ask Elton John to record a disco album? Why not Billy Joel or someone else? Wouldn't be because he's 'gay' would it?And disco is not Elton's thing; this album jars with his usual persona of Tough Texan Rancher who chases cow-women on wild bulls, a perfect representation of who Elton John really is. And if it isn't, well, we get the point, this isn't his usual fare.Should he have covered 'Johnny B Goode' as a disco song? Who knows! But I do know some of the other songs are quite fun (Street Boogie), or even melodious (Thunder in the Night).If you aren't a fervent believer in some sought of unwritten 'rock' ethic, then you should be able to enjoy the last five songs. Anyway, his vocals aren't as 'bad' (for lack of better negative adjective that is supposed to make impact) as they are on the two albums either side. Just don't let that pounding beat get to your head. Rating **3/4 or 2.75"
2,LOGITECH QUICKCAM COMMUNICATE STX,"The camera did not come in the original Logitech packaging. It was encased and bubblewrap. The CD was in a sealed type of plastic envelope. I bought this because it was advertised as ""Vista Compatible"". Many times I have installed and reinstalled the software to no avail. The only way that a picture was made with the camera was to install drivers from Logitech's Website. I troubleshooted through the sight because the camera would not work on Instant Messenger (only a black screen). The tech support number for Logitech is not a toll free number. Obviously, this camera and software had been a return and they sent me a dud."
1,response to scott hardman,"Since when is the belief in any religion based on proof? Faith in definition is the belief in something when no proof is evident. So if you're gonna try to ""get us"" you'll to come up with a more substantial argument."
4,Fascinating Chinese Intrigue,"The sights, sounds and smells of modern day China leap from each page of this complex mystery. Assistant US Attorney, David Stark is reunited with his former lover, Liu Hulan of the Chinese Ministry of Public Safety as they unravel a mystery involving gangs and the illegal shipment of medicinal products made from endangered specieis, into the US. The resolution reaches to the highest levels of both governments involving six murders along the way.Liu Hulan had been educated in the US, received a law degree there and was working in a top notch law firm in Los Angeles when she became involved with Stark. She mysteriously leaves him and returns to China only to be unexpectedly reunited with him many years later in this novel. The resolution of this fine mystery also unravels Hulan's complex personal and family history spanning China from Mao's Revolution, the Cultural Revolution to the modern day."
2,Adequate,"Adequate says it all...meeting our needs but could have been made much tougher. There is an additional piece sent with this product to put on to better meets safety / pinching risks...but nothing is predrilled for it. Again, adequate but I wish I would have made another purchase."
3,Good stuff,"This book will empower woman to take the lead while their men sit and read the paper. If you like this, get the novel Defenders of the Holy Grail and you'll smile some more!!"
5,Fun and informative!,"Finally a sports reference book written for a woman's sense of humor! A must read for all ""cool chicks"" that want to more out of baseball games than just bad hotdogs!"
2,"If you have access to no other Y2k book, read this one.","I really wanted to like this book.The author wraps an excessively complex, pointless ""plot"" around a thin discussion of Y2k issues. In Priam's Y2k, everything works pretty well, except there are a few National Guard checkpoints? Oh, that's scary.First reaction after finishing the book... ""Hunh? That's IT?"". Second reaction, I flipped it over to see what I had paid... glad I got a good deal at Amazon"
2,Could have done better...,"Mr. Grant is supposedly trained in the classics-- having read Plutarc, Augustine, Milton, and so on. Why are there only classical illusions and not the profoundity of the wealth of knowledge for which Mr. Grant is widely known? Surely it was not Mr. Hyatts fault for such a poor plot, dullness of characters, and ineffective use of sentax. The first two chapters are good and the conclusion is one that every Christian should take to heart, but having read other books by the authors I know they could have done far better."
1,Naive religious diatribe with few technical insights,"This is a poorly written, shallow, naive, moralistic diatribe on a serious technical and cultural issue, contrived by two right-wing religious fundamentalists who dare to compare Margaret Sanger to Adolph Hitler and Josef Stalin. Shame! Boycott this book!!"
1,Very bad book - don't buy,"If I purchased this book in 1995 when Delphi came up I would be really satisfied. But when you have around ""Developers guide"" and ""Mastering"" books along with the list of other usefull ones, I consider that buying this book is just waste of your money."
2,Mostly Mineral Oil and Vaseline,I think calling this solid cocoa butter is somewhat misleading. It would be better to say 'with cocoa butter'. I have seen pure cocoa butter sold elsewhere for the same price or even less.
3,Not very soothing,"My allergies are acting up and I needed a kleenex that didn't create those ""dust"" particles when using it and it couldn't be rough. Well, this brand seems strong, but I really don't feel any lotion when I use this brand. I even checked to make sure that I bought the Kleenex with lotion. After constantly using it my nose felt very irritated and a little dry. The Kleenex isn't the best that I've used, but it's certainly not the worst I've tried."
1,Dull and Plotless,"While comedian Al Franken is normally quite humorous, this novel was a bit dull. There's very little plot and after awhile every page seems like the one before it. Sure, there's the occasional funny part, but overall this book is not worth reading. Quite frankly, it's just stupid. If it didn't have Al's name on the cover it is very doubtful anyone would pick this up. If you're looking for something humorous read The Idiot Girl's Guide to Action and Adventure or The Bear Went Over the Mountain."
4,Al Franken is a self-absorbed idiot - and it's a riot!,"If you like politics and can see through the politicians' insincere statements and empty photo ops -- then you're on the same page as Franken, who plays it to the hilt as the latest character-less candidate playing politics just to get elected.This book is much more than funny -- it's Franken shooting an arrow and hitting a bulls-eye at just how ridiculous politics has become in this country."
4,"Reasonably entertaining, with a good number of big laughs","Like Franken's earlier book, this account of the Franken presidency has enough really good lines to make it worth the read. But also like his earlier book, there are long stretches that are only mildly amusing. I suspect this book may not play as well to those who have not watched enough TV punditry to recognize, say, Howard Fineman and Norm Ornstein. On the other hand, anyone who has ever read Newsweek shouldn't miss the (fake) Newsweek puff piece on Franken's campaign, which is priceless."
2,Badly Needs an Editor,"There's a nugget of a good book here. Franken can be very funny, and there's lots of material in a fake Presidental memoir. But the few good bits--character sketches, amusing mishaps--are buried in the format. Press releases, a Time cover story, diary entries; it all gets overwhelming and repetitive. Had this been written as a straight memoir, it might have been delightful, but the jokey format brings it down."
1,uneducated,"Anyone who states (and jokes) that chronic fatigue syndrome is depression is uneducated. I guess he knows more than the CDC. Am telling everyone I know not to buy it. Am sure the author would not make the same uneducated comments about cancer, AIDS, etc. His appearances on T.V. stating the same thing are as uneducated as his book. An apology to cfs sufferers is in order."
1,Mastering Photoshop 6,The material in the book is good up to a point where the cd program inevitably crashes. This is not only frustrating but gets my computer locked up. In this context I would say that... spent on the book was largely wasted. This program hasn't just locked up once or twice but every time I have tried to use it. I'm running Windows ME with a Pentium 4 processor and 512 RAM
4,GREAT! But features are dull,2 Easter eggs and they are only in one place. The dvd is just for the show its self and not the features at all... and we know Rooster Teeth for their amazing DVD extras... Said best RVB DVD ever but it's like 4rth. Now why I know it was so cheap... So.. Buy a bunch and give them to your friends!
2,Sad flat puppy,"I'm giving this toy's educational value five stars. I've learned more in Georgia. Sometimes value is reflected in how we learn not to act. The dog died because I let her run free. There was no escape, and no run. No run that we were captives to an action. A service entrance left the dog loose. The dog's being loose -- lack of smell - meant I was unable to give it meat. Nutrition was usually left outside the service entrance. The dog went through the entry, changing its name. A truck then came at very fast paces. I wanted to run and tell my momma on ya'll. I broke. Time till entry? She was a yelper. I was given a few seconds with the pile. Puddled, our interaction lacked a fluid. I soon pupped and found pain was involved. My fault, crazy at the end and leashed - air being left in a flat to sour - lay down to perform the angel in creamed corn I would not be hungry enough to eat."
2,Droopy dog on a leash.,"My main complaint with this leash was the floppy nature of the ""harness"" part. It drooped when we tried to use it. It was also very misshapen. It worked best when we just put the leash around a stuffed dog and pretended that way. The metal rod was very bent up by the end of our show, but it was ok for the price. Not very durable. Shipping was very quick."
2,Invisible dog leash just ok,"I was a little bit disappontied with the Invisible Dog Leash because it was packaged so poorly. It was all folded up and flattened when it arrived so it was very hard to unbend the wire so it looked normal. I tried putting heavy books on it for a few days to make it look normal. Also the leather part where the dog would be was flattened so it didn't look right.But it was a huge hit with the kids. Little kids liked to ""pet"" my dog and then the older ones liked taking the dog for a walk. A few of them put a stuffed animal in place of my invisible dog and took that for a walk. So that was really cute.I don't think it'll be in much shape to be used again but good for a one time costume."
4,No dog included,"Give yourself some time to stretch this ""puppy"" out before use. It needs some tweaking in order for it to look like there's a dog at the end."
1,Ouch...Ignorance Can Be Costly,"Not being an expert and lured by the attraction of live footage of the Tangerine Dream Froese, Franke, and Baumann line-up and the set up that this was some great special occasion and production, I snatched it up when I saw it. I've been had - at a fat list price! It is less than 30 minutes and what seems to be different music than what is being filmed most of the time. Wiser, but poorer, the least I can do is join in on the warnings not to buy this one. Stay away. Stick to the CDs."
1,Please make an improved copy,"The producers of this DVD, need to go back, and watch it at least a couple of times. So, they will realize,the overkill of images destroy the live performance. It actually made my eyes strain. I'm a big collector of T.D.Maybe find more archivel video footage, and make a montage of live concerts from that era. It would certainly be much easier on the eyes to watch a live stage performance with the original lineup."
3,Not bad for the price.,"This isn't a bad product for the price, there are more cost effective miso samplers and such out there but this is the real deal. This was imported from Japan and I'd recommend if you are a real ""otaku"" of Japan. But it took me about four attempts of bland soup to get the mix of miso and water just right, since there were no picture instructions, just kanji. I think I will try another type of miso before I get this one again. 3 stars because the product isn't _bad_ it is just not the miso packet for me."
4,Going Steady,"This book is for cinema enthusiasts. The reviews are old, many of them for movies that passed long ago from public memory. The remaining value is Kael's absolute love affair with cinema, evidence as she waxes on about the movies, what cinema is (or was at the time of the writing) and what it should be. This isn't journalism. Kael's opinion is the star of the book, but her passion for this most modern of artforms is infectious.It's also fun reading Kael's take on certain well-remembered films. Sometimes her reviews are right on, while other times she denounces moves that would later prove beloved classics. Always, though, Kael is sharp, full of vigor, and entertaining."
2,Average at best,There is nothing remarkable about this book. It loses momentum about halfway through. It isn't a big book and there doesn't seem to be much depth in the coverage. Look else where.
4,Thickest Is The Best,"Everyday we use paper towels to cleanup in the kitchen and the batroom. We also use it to pickup those little messes on the floor. Out of all the brands I've tried, Kleenex really knows what it is about when it comes to really making the best in paper towels. This pack of Viva paper towels is very thick, and really picks up much more than other brands like Bounty and Brawny. Although it is more expensive than other brands, it really deliver the best in value and quality, and you could sometimes re-use it because it is so thick to pickup thicker messes. I absolutely love this brand, it is really worth the money. I just wish there were more sheets to use per roll.Price: B+Convience: A-Overall: B+"
3,Nobility in the Rough,Not especially well written but of great interest to me because it deals with some of my early ancestors in California
3,GGW ESB 6,"Well First the solo segment. It seems like she didn't know whether she wanted to go through with this or not. A lot of play and stop, play and stop. Finally she decided to go and from then things heated up. There is a 5 girl bash where they get down to panties ""thongs' only and all action is just good natured horsing around. Ye olde whipped cream spray can comes into play which seemed quite messy to me.One of the more adventuresome girls eventually lowered her thong and showed off her Ring Dang Doo. No big deal. There was a stage of sorts set up with up to 4 or more girls on at one time. Girls sans clothing and doing all sorts of things. one of one girl going down on another to the others delight, and on to a 69 performance. Worth getting I thought."
2,A BAD BRUSH,"Being a senior, I was disappointed when I could no longer purchase lather shave cream and I hated the aerosol cans because they were wasteful and messy!! This looked my answer to my shaving desires. I could now lather up like the good old days, but almost immediately bristles started coming out and in no time the whole brush came apart. The mug and soap are fine, but it was necessary to visit a local drug store and purchase a new brush which is working fine."
3,Mystique,"This wasn't bad but an irritating heroine and a too perfect hero made this a 3 star. The heroine was as naive and simple as a 10 year old and the hero, although feared across the land, was giving, honourable and a little too perfect. Whenever I have to wonder why a hero or heroine could possibly be in love with the other I have trouble getting past it.Alice, the heroine, was so annoying that I wondered why Hugh found her so appealing. For me to really enjoy a romance I have to really like both characters.This was my first book by Amanda Quick and I'll probably read another one but this was not a 5 star book in my opinion."
5,awsome book,this book is fun to read. one of the only medeival books written by amanda quick.high in action.
5,Go treasure hunting with Amanda Quick!,This is one of my favorite romances---it was just too much fun! A great plot filled with wonderful characters and a treasure cap off this great book.
3,They do the job,"This is a pretty simple and standard office product. These work as well as any I've tried. Nice for those who like to make and keep really organized paper records, but aren't paper records supposed to be going away :)?"
2,lovebird breeder,"This book does not at all explain what to feed your birds. breeding, nesting, health care it should be called a professionals point of vew good pictures but dont fully expain mutation coloring. Was very dissipointed in this book TITLE is very mis leading if you want a book with pictures of lovebirds with out full discription of them it is ok but other wise it is totaly useless"
4,"GREAT, BUT A LITTLE FLIMSY.",I am a professional make-up artist and purchased this to combine some of the hundreds of lipsticks I own and it's been great for that. My one complaint is the plastic middle divider is a bit flimsy and doesn't always flip very smoothly from side to side.
5,This is the best Animorph book I've read!,The Android is awesome! The best part was when the android saved Marco as he was about to die. It was very scary. I could not stop reading the book. I think people who have not read this book should do so soon.
5,That's reallly Entertainment,"This guy's the greatest. I didn't even know who he was, but the title just hooked me . . . and I did not put this book down until three hours later ... After I'd gleefully gobbled up every single word. It's a fast, joyous read!"
5,"Highland whisky, ancient feuds","""Now May You Weep"" takes us with detective Gemma James and her best friend, Hazel Cavendish, to the Scottish Highlands for a culinary weekend. Hazel has deep family roots in the beautiful area, famous for flavorful, aged whisky made in picturesque distilleries. Her homecoming reveals some of the details of her earlier life and a previous romance with the handsome Donald Brodie, whom Gemma is surprised to find, has never completely left Hazel's life.Crombie uses a flashback technique, quoting the diaries of two women in the late 1880s, to weave a tale of passion, fortune, and long-kept secrets. The reader will be swept along as Gemma pieces together disparate evidence to solve a tragic murder, and as she comes to know her close friend Hazel on an even deeper level. Kudoes to Crombie for another great read!"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed when I opened it and it was already broken. I had to request for a replacement.
3,Mixed Opinion,"I thought the book was well crafted and greatly admire the level of period detail. It was interesting and the charcters were well developed. I would read the sequel, because I care what happens to Elizabeth and Nathanael. However, I was most distracted by the references to Pride and Prejudice. This is a completely different kind of story written at a different time by a different author. There is nothing of the Bennets in this novel, and I found the constant references to be rather jarring. I do not like to be winked at by the author when I am reading a novel, I should not see ""the man behind the curtain""."
3,Didn't live up to potential,"I thought the beginning few chapters were pretty interesting and thought they would set the tone for the entire book. I didn't come in to this book with the thought of comparing it to any other novel, but I couldn't help but compare it to the Outlander series, due to the fact that after reading the first few chapters, I could tell that this author was a fan of that series as well and the fact that the author even brought up the characters from the Outlander series in her book - that was a little bizarre - why on earth would anyone do that? You're just begging to be compared. I thought this book had a lot of potential but unfortunately didn't live up to it. I am not interested to find out ""what happens next"" because I'm not interested in the main characters. I thought the ending was a lame attempt to make sure people would read the next book. And I believe it is premature to call this an ""epic story""."
2,"definitely not ""Outlander"" quality","I really really wanted to like this book, since I love historical novels and the setting should be fascinating. But I couldn't get past the first few chapters due to the author's pedestrian writing style and ho-hum characterizations. I was also constantly put off by anachronistic speech patterns. The publisher wants you to think this is ""Outlander in America"" but it's simply not. I've read many a paperback genre romance with more flare and dramatic tension than found in this book."
2,James Fennimore Cooper is spinning in his grave,"The author of these books has some talent for spinning a good if derivative historic romance plot line. And if she took liberties with Cooper's original characters, so did the movie versions most readers are probably more familar with, anyway. 'Tis a pity an unremitting political correctness distracts from the story.Any time a character who is a person of color is introduced to the story line, the reader can predict with close to 100% certainty they will be preternaturally wise, possess an altruistic streak to make Mother Teresa a piker by comparison or have motives as pure as Ivory soap.By the time I was halfway through the book, I found all the noble Native Americans and selfless blacks insufferably boring. How I longed for a villain like Magua to add some zest to a half baked pastiche."
4,Good first novel,I loved this novel and am now hooked on reading the entire series. There were some loose ends left hanging that definitely made me want to read more. Historical fiction is my favorite reading genre and this one fits the bill.
5,exemplary historical fiction,"This is an outstanding book. I cannot understand readers who compare it to Gabaldon and find it lacking. The story is riveting from the first page, and Elizabeth and Nathaniel are -- as Diana Gabaldon has said herself -- wonderful. This is not a traditional romance, that it true. It is much more than that, intelligently and beautifully written."
2,Not up to the hype,"I was disappointed with this book. It was so highly praised, especially by so many Outlander fans. I was constantly wanting more character development and a less predictable plot. It is nothing more than a romance novel. I wanted more of the history, more character depth and therefore it fell flat for me. Towards the end I found myself skipping quickly through the pages because I wanted something profound to happen, which never did."
4,"Insightful, heart-stopping suspense, laughter and tears.","I never thought I would love an author's writing more than D. Gabaldon, but I was wrong. The plot weaves character after character into an intricate, well-balanced story that makes you feel involved. The ending dropped off too soon, but I'll just buy the next one. Intelligent and entertaining."
5,TOPS!,"Great read! The author gets into each main character so that you get to know them. It is exciting and holds your attention with every turn of the page but it also has its very tender moments. It's a feel-good because so far the bad guys get their just reward. It's a book you cannot put down, but at the same time you do not want it to end. I look forward to the sequel in Fall 1999."
1,poorly written copy cat!!,"I was fooled into reading this book by reviews that the ""Into the Wilderness"" series is like Diana Gabaldon's books... this is not true! I'm not even 100 pages in and I'm sorely disappointed. So far,scene for scene, she is COPYING J.F. Cooper, whom she thanks (in the author's notes) for ""inspiration"". ...and the truly disappointing part about all of this, is that she ruins all of Cooper's characters (many of which she never even bothered to change names for), making them flat and predictable-If you would like a nice series of books to read, I recommend the original Cooper series."
4,"Family First, Last and in Between",A gripping family saga. Set in the eighteenth century. A picutre of the Americas in its' days of establishment. Loved the characters and couldn't wait to read on to find out what trials and tribulations they encountered.
2,Economic recording of some standard repertoire,"This CD is a relatively inexpensive way to add recordings of some standard tuba literature to your library. However, I believe that there are discs of the Gregson and Vaughn Williams Concerti that feature better playing, better musical interpretation, and higher recording quality. Only recommended if you are on a tight budget and need a reference recording of any of these pieces."
1,Boring,"Music was very boring. The so-called ""concertos"" did not meet my expectaions as a classical trained musician. That's why I applyed for a refund. I would not recommend that cd to anyone."
3,"good story, good animation","Although the animation in this film is not as refined as Ninja Scroll or Akira, the stories are good as well as the plot. It's not a bad one to add to your anime collection."
1,Great until Windows XP,This is a great beginner scanner on Windows 98 or older..does not work with XP...found out the hard way. Great for scanning & cropping photos for email.
1,Will ruin cabinets. Do NOT buy,Leaked from power cord but did not realize until ruined cabinet and more.This terrible design. Happens with all of these after a year.This should not leak but doesTerrible product.
1,Wait for the kettle!,"I have just had my third Instant Hot removed. This one was installed 2-3 years ago. Following the advice of a prior reviewer, I had the plumber open the tank to identify the source of the leak. It was a failure where the element screws into the tank.This is the third time this device has failed in an unconscionably brief period, damaging and staining my cabinetry. I bought the third item because the stainless steel tank was supposed to resist corrosion.Caveat emptor!"
3,5 years of use. But fixable.,"I have the older SST (no filtration), made in 03/2007. Started leaking, as the one we had prior, today after 5 1/2 years. Obviously out of warranty, but disassembled it and found exactly the same tubing problem as in the pics on this page: cracked thin tubing turned brown with heat and age. Fortunately, my tank is still fine (no rust at the screws). Will repair with $3 piece of better tubing and be back in business. This is our third Insinkerator. Average lifespan has been about 5 years."
1,Horrible product.,"This is a horrible product. They leak water under the sink causing damage that they don't cover the cost of fixing. This unit failed less than a year into ownership. It was installed in my new home while the home was being constructed in 2008. ISE provided me a replacement tank under warranty but just like the original, it now drips water out of the bottom of the tank too. I'm not going to even call ISE to see if this is still under warranty, I don't want another - even for free."
5,Replacement was EASY,"I replaced my old InSinkerator unit with the SST. At first, I was uneasy, but the job only took about 5 minutes. New tube connectors were easier than the first one. Unit running perfectly and has a longer warranty than the old unit."
1,Failed much too early!!!,"Like many others, my tank developed a leak that became worse over time. InSinkErator customer service was horrible and said that their warranty was only a year. Never again! We installed the hot water dispenser from Waste King (bought at Costco) that is available here in Amazon at our vacation home. After 2 years, it performs flawlessly. Besides being reliable, the Waste King is also much less expensive than the InSinkErator. I posted this review on the InsinkErator faucdet as well."
2,Wonderful until it dies,"Wonderful supply of hot water, until the device fails. First one lasted under three years, second one under two years, so third one will be a different manufacturer."
3,"Good, but not great","This is the second one I have purchased. Wife loves the instant hot water, for tea. First unit lasted 2.5 years, set at 190 degrees. Problem is the warranty is 2 years. This one I set for 140 degrees, with the hope it will last longer. For up to a quart of INSTANT hot water, this is the best bet, unless you are willing to spend another $200 for an electrician to bring 220 VAC to the sink for a larger on-demand water heater."
4,InSinkErator SST-FLTR 2/3-Gallon Stainless Tank and Filtration System,"This is my second under sink hot water heater unit. These are really easy to install even for people with average DIY skills such as myself. I would suggest bolting the metal hangar to your wall permanently. That way, over the years, as you replace these (they only last a few years generally) it will speed up and ease the installation process."
3,Purchased as a replacement,I purchased the new tank to replace on older one that was leaking so the installation was just a matter of attaching the supply lines and mounting to the wall. I did not install the filter and I would have been happier if I could have just purchased the tank but I was not able to find the tank sold alone. This is my 3rd replacement - and while the tank is stainless steel the prior tank had to be replaced because the internal supply lines essentially disintegrated. Each tank /assembly seems to last less than 5 years.
5,Excellent,In kind replacement that actually works better than the original. Will definitely order again when and if this one fails sometime down the road.
1,Had warranty problem when we first bought it a year later the tank leaked,Quality and support definitely needs improvement. They seem to be trained on how to avoid warranty problems. Had a problem right out of the box with the faucet. In less than a year the tank started leaking.
2,InSinkerator SST-FLTR 2/3 Gallon Water Heater,"The InSinkErator SST-FLTR 2/3 Gallon Stainless Tank and filtration System is sold as a stand alone unit as Instant Hot Water dispenser for a price ranging from $189.00 - $220.00. In fact is can not be used stand alone unless you have 7/16 polyethylene pipe to connect to the fittings on the water heater. Plumbing suppliers that I contacted informed me that 7/16 polyethylene pipe is no longer manufactured. When I contacted the distributor I was told that this unit can only be used with InSinkErator faucets that are sold separate at a price of approximately $200.00.I really wanted this unit to work so I exployed numerous suppliers of polyethylene pipe and found that size 7/16"" is non-existant. If the manufacture wanted to sell this product as a stand alone item they should include all the necessary connections required to use it.After many frustrating hours I repackaged the product and returned it."
2,A Necessary evil.,"This is the THIRD hot water tank we have bought for this system. I have searched for an alternative brand and haven'tfound one yet.The concept is great and we have gotten so used to the convenience of filtered hot & cold water right on the kitchen sink, thatwe find it hard to do without it. The filters are changed every 6 months or so and can be readily purchased for a competitiveprice on Amazon. The tank price was a good buy as well on Amazon. I can't believe that Insinkerator, a major player in the plumbing field,can't sort out the known problems in this tank."
3,I love instant hot water but this is my second ISE tank in ten years.,I had the original white metal tank unit ten years ago but it corroded and failed about five years in. I cut it open with a sawzall and the tank was full of mineral debris and had leaked.I replaced it with the newer gray plastic bodied unit with SS tank and plumbed a water filtration unit to it. Five years later the water flows but is no longer hot. The heating element is now bad and trips the electrical breaker.I hate replacing this thing every five years but I can't live without it. I love having instant hot water for hot drinks and for help with cleaning stubborn messes on pots and pans. I just wish the reliablity was better.
1,Piece of Junk,"This is my second replacement in 5 years. my first instahot lasted 14 years.I redid my kitchen and bought the instahot with the filter and dispenser spent 400+ on it 2.5 years later, it leaks and ruins the bottom of my new kitchen cabinet. I called insinkerator and it was out of warranty Original was 2 years. They sent me the newer model at a discount, but I had to pay for it. I was not happy but had no other choice. It lasted less than 2 years, and it started to leak again. They are shipping me a new one, but buyer beware. this will leak! and make sure you put a bucket underneath, or else when it leaks it will ruin your cabinet"
2,plastic tubing inside busts,"The website for Insinkerator says: ""Built for durability."" However ours broke after 3 years (right after warranty expired, coincidentally enough. Why did it bust? There is a little plastic tube inside where the hot water runs through, and it runs right next to some hot metal elements. Shockingly, plastic tubing in these conditions does not seem to last. Clearly, Insinkerator could have spent the extra 50 cents per unit to use copper/metal tubing if they REALLY want to make it durable."
1,Moroccan Straw Tote Bag,"This Tote Bag is junk. It came out the box poorly manufactured, with the top rim unfinished. Since then, after just one month, one of the straps has broken (it is not leather, but some other junky material).Avoid at all costs."
3,not what i expected,"I viewed The French Lieutenant's Woman in 1969 or 1970. I thought this might be the same film, but I was mistaken. Can't find the earlier version any where."
5,Beautiful Acting,"This movie was a mystery to me the first time I saw it. But it has captured me and I can't stop watching it. I love Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. The most interesting thing in this movie is the ability to see Streep move in and out of character...from the actress to the character the actress portrays, and, in some cases, to herself...this role(s) demands much personal input from Streep herself...she is a genius. Irons is notable as well...I like his voice, but he has nothing on Streep. Also I recommend ""Out of Africa"" to all you other Streep fanatics."
2,Not Plus Sized,I was very disappointed with this book. The styles are somewhat boring and the largest size in any pattern in this book is 46 inches. Sorry I bought it.
1,"Not a plus size book, not even close!","I was extremely disappointed with this book. The title is very misleading. The title says that there are designs for ""plus sizes,"" but everything in this book is for 36 - 46. 46 doesn't even count as extra large people. How is that plus size? How is that ANY different from EVERY other knitting book out there that doesn't advertise ""plus size"" patterns? Most of the designs are boring, *old* and made with $300 dollars of yarn. Do yourself a favor and skip this book!Edit: Yes, I am aware that yarn substitutions are possible, but not all knitters are comfortable making substitutions. Knitters often want to make the sweater as pictured.Secondly, and the real issue, this book claims to be for plus sized women. While a *relaxed* size 46 may have a finished chest measurement of 50 inches or so, that doesn't mean that the sweater will fit or flatter a plus size woman. Since a 2x is roughly a 52-inch chest, this book has absolutely NOTHING for a woman 2x or higher."
2,good styles,"Although this book has some great styles in it, they are still to small for me. But I can still use it for my Mother who takes a smaller size. I will also try to alter the patterns to fit me."
1,Not what I expected.,"If you consider a size 12 plus size and have $200+ dollars to drop on yarn for unflattering sweaters, then this is the book for you. If you are a hip pleasantly plump size 18+ knitter looking for great current designs, do not get this book."
1,It's as if they weren't even trying...,"I was very excited to learn awhile back that Rowan would be publishing a book of plus-size patterns. I love Rowan yarns, and wow--the beautiful designs found in the pages of Rowan magazine in my size!But, alas, I was bitterly disappointed.First of all, plus-size does not mean over 65. Make that 85. My 67yo mother wouldn't be caught dead in most of this stuff.Second, plus-size does not mean ugly, shapeless, and/or boring.This book is an insult to plus-size knitters. I have a feeling these designers were forced at gunpoint to produce this work. It's too bad they didn't seize the opportunity to create something useful and beautiful. It's too bad Rowan chose designers who simply weren't up to the challenge."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want flattering styles in large sizes, don't waste your money buying this book.The sizes are not generous, and if I'm going to have to resize a pattern, I'll start with something that actually suits my shape, thank you.Bobbles on bulges? Get real!I passed my copy along to the library where some frumpy size 14 may get some use out of it."
5,chau doc,"i was part of this action which drew described in his book. i was evacuated to an ammo boat on the river along with maggie consequently i was not a part of the heroic efforts drew conducted inside the town throughout that day and this clarified many issues for me. i consider myself fortunate that drew, the seals, and the mike force took agressive action when they did or i just might not be alive today to review what he has written.libby ginnettiUSAID Asst. Prov. Rep.Chau Doc ProvinceVietnam 1966-1968"
3,doesn't work with Olympus D-340R Digital Camera,"This is available as an accessory for the Olympus D-340R Digital Camera, but this camera can only handle a maximum of the 16 MB version"
3,Too Long A Read!,I found this book to be long in getting to the point of the story.In the beginning Dr. Paul Osborn is in a Paris cafe andsees the man who killed his father many years before.He findshis real identity through the services of a private detective.The killer assassinates the detective.A Los Angeles homicide detective named McVey is in London trying to solve themystery of seven headless corpses.A stroke victim is escorted back to Germany from a recovery facility in Arizona.He is greetedby the business establishment in Germany.Osborn has fallen into the company of the mistress of the French Prime Minister.All ofthese factors meet and you discover a plot to bring the Nazis back to power.If you decide to read this book you will have tobe patient because it is long and drawn out.It takse forever to get to the point.
5,State of the art action thriller,"This is truly one of those books that you can't and don't put down, one that you'll stay up until 3 in the morning trying to finish. I've never read a book with more action, more car chases, bombs, and all that good stuff. Perfect book when you are on vacation"
2,Terrible ending,"This book was a 4-star up until the last third. It was as if the author wanted to wrap the book up to meet a deadline. He started pulling out tired old premises. The plots started to twist like a pretzel. As entertaining as the first part of the book was, the ending was a major disappointment."
2,OH DEAR LORD!!!!!! Did we all read the same book???,"I'll keep this short (unlike the book itself)... It's filled with stock characters from the worst Hollywood B movie, has more holes in the plot than the finest Swiss cheese and it's almost as long as Ulysses for crying out loud!!!!! If you're in any doubt open the last page and read the last 7 words and then decide if you want to read anything that has this for a punchline... Readable but try Robert Harris ""Fatherland"" instead..."
3,This books dissappoints,"Starts off well, seemed interesting throughout the book but in the end it dissapoints. From the start until the end, i kept telling myself that whatever this book is building towards, its going to be damn good. But wow it dissapoints. !"
1,Without a doubt the worst ending of any book ever published,"The book starts out decent, grabs you by the throat and makes you hang on every word, until that final scene where you think to yourself:Why the heck did I bother, They F**** H*****'s H***?!?!?!?You'll hate yourself for reading this. Please do not bother."
4,What a Body Count!,"This is a rip roaring good yarn, though it runs about 200 pages too long. After a while, it becomes just too hard to suspend disbelief as the body count rises into the hundreds and the coincidences mount.But - if you can keep the improbabilities (not to mention scientific impossibilities) from getting to you, excitement awaits on every page."
5,total enjoyment,I really enjoyed every single word of this book. I had a problem: sometimes I had to sleep a few hours...
5,"Spellbinding, Memorable, I Can't Wait for Folsom's Next.","Not since ""A Passage to India"" have so many plot changes and twists kept my attention. I couldn't wait to turn the page. The book is solidly on my personal Top Ten List. My bookstore visits always start with a search for Mr Folsom's next effort. Soon I hope"
2,"With a better editor, it could have been an excellent book.","I can't quite agree with sparks@campfour from Salt Lake but he was pretty close. Folsom wrote a very complex, convoluted novel but he got some of his facts wrong, i.e., absolute zero is 459.69 deg. F., not something over 500 deg. F. In a couple of places, he had the hero remembering faces that he had seen at a distance at night in the rain. He had just too many people acting correctly on impulse, intuition or coincidence. I grant there are probably detectives as experienced and knowledgable as detective McVey but I dare say there are none who have his unfailing sense of what what his next action should be. Perhaps with a better editor, Folsom could turn in a good novel. I got through the book OK but I had some trouble with believablilty."
1,Other 100 pages would have brought men to extintion!,"How many murders!Further more murders and noone on the earth wouldhave survived...The plot is unbelievable, the way of writing is elementar, there's no suspence.There are also many errors: Rhein river is confused with Rhone river during Von Holden's journey from Marseille to Paris, no man on the earth can swim butterfly for 6.2 km, an EuroCity (Paris-Meaux) is not a train for commuters, Federal Bundesbank is a redundant term, on the JungfrauJoch there's not aski school, because there's not skiing there.Like many other readers I guessed 100 pages beforethe end that Adolf Hitler's head was in the box...The only thing I liked was that the book endedon the swiss alps, which i love."
2,Only Read Half,"For a plot that has been used so many times you think it would have worked a bit better. The book started off well enough. I got into the extra sub plots - they were done well. The character mix was engrossing with good descriptions and development. The author is a good writer, always painting vivid pictures for the minds eye of the surroundings and locations. It is just the last third of the book disappointed all most to the level that when I came to the end I was mad. I felt I had been hoodwinked, how could the first two third's of the book be so good, fresh etc and the last bit be such a half hearted effort on a tired plot?"
2,Some problems,I had some problems with this card. I use it in an Olympus digital camera. The first five or six images taken have an annoying yellow stripe down the right side. I can usually cut this out in photoshop but I have lost some important shots because of this defect present in the card I purchased.
4,Down River,"...I read Down River and I really enjoyed it it wasreaaly great. I personally was really exicited to get stared on DownRiver. The book Down River was really interesting it explined things on how to go River rafing. I reaaly want to go River rafting in the Summer. I hope soon there will be anothor Down River in the future.My favorite characters in this book were Star, and Freddie they were the best they both had really great attitudes. Down River was the greatest book. END"
4,D-A_B-E-S-T,"Down River, I love this book! It is the perfect, coolest, best book ever! The only problem. . . foreshadowing. To much of it you know exactly what will happen next, and how it will happen. This destroyed the 5-Star of the book; in my opinion. I don't even like to read but this WAS the best book I have read and it was very fun it had many adventures that kept it going and on it's feet even if it had alot of foreshadowing. I recomend this book for all 8 graders alike, even if your teacher doesn't read you still can with out her or anyone else. JUST GRAB THIS BOOK AND READ IT ALREADY! Sklour"
5,Downriver,"I'm 13 years old and I really enjoyed this book. I liked this book because it seemed so real and I was able to picture what was happening while it was happening. You would know that I really liked this book because as soon as I started to read it I couldn't put it down, and usually I don't finish the books I start, but I had to finish this one. If you are looking for an adventurous book to read, I would recommend you read this book."
1,I HATE IT,downriver is one of the most boring books i have ever read... i had to read it 4 english class or i never would of read it it gets 1 star for the effort the author put into it though
4,down river book by baby spice,"This book is pretty good. The title is down river will hobs the main chatterer is Jessie. She went to camp because his father had sent her. She was benign a really troublemaker when Jessie got to the camp she met new friends.There is Tory, Star, Freddy, Al, Pug, Heather, and Adam. They all go to this adventure without no parents. All of this takes place in Colorado. They go down the river and they go thought a lot of things"
4,Down River,"Our class has recently finished the book Down River. Personally I thought it was a pretty interesting book. What I liked the most about it was, that at the end of every chapter it leaves you hanging. It makes you want to read more. It also has a lot of action. So if you want to read an interesting book I would recomend Down River. -Brian"
4,Down River,"Hi my name is Amelia I'm a 14 year old girl from Utah. We read down river In my 8th grade English class. I don't usually read books, but once we started to read this book I never wanted to stop, and when we read this book all the way through, i wanted to read it again. I would recommend this book to people who like to read, and like to river raft. -Amelia"
4,Downriver,I feel this book had alot of adveture and thrills. Many people might not like this book but I enjoyed it. If you like adventureand the outdoors this is the book to see and read. Theres many exciting parts in this book and I would recommened this book to people who are adventreous.
2,Predictable and boring,This is the second novel I've read from Amanda Quick. I downloaded and read Ravished first and liked it enough to check out more books from Quick. Unfortunately I was led astray by the reviews for Mistress. I thought it was a pretty boring story. I didn't care much for the characters and thought the two leads lacked chemistry. Don't think I'll keep this one.
1,terrible,little better than porn.should not be sold to anyone under the age of 80.none of her books are worth the paper they are printed on
4,Deserves Wider Readership,"This is a fascinating tale of adventure and hardship. It provides frank and timely insights on the culture of North Africa and the aggressive and duplicitous predations of its leaders and corsairs. It is well researched history and a fascinating biography. One is reminded how ephemeral power and civilization can be. I found its flow sometimes halting, but otherwise a very enjoyable read and recommend the book to all."
2,Not impressed,"If you are looking for a film to show a class after reading the novel, pass this one by. I didn't think it captured the emotions of the monster or the families effectively. There were some good scenes, but for the most part, I was disappointed that it didn't follow the novel more closely."
2,Just ok,Not near as good or close to the book as the one with Brannagh and DeNiro. This apparently was a made-for-tv movie and the production just doest measure up.
5,frankenstein,"great film! as close to the novel as you will EVER find! not to be missed horror flick. hallmark SHOCKED ME when they announced an involvement with this novel, but they did an awsome job. many thanks to them, and the reviewers who convinced me to buy this film."
2,suspiciously similar plot....,"I gave this book two stars because it was well written and amusing. Mr Brundy was a likeable hero (although with a stilted faux-cockney accent that vanished and reappeared at random). I could not feel much empathy with Lady Helen, however, as Ms South spent little time developing her character. Lady Helen came across as a puppet with no depth, and her doubtful transformation from shrew to loving spouse was contrived and awkward.More disturbing, however, was the strange sense of deja-vu I experienced while reading this book. It was a composite of several Georgette Heyer novels, most notably ""the Convenient Marriage"" and ""April Lady,"" complete with irresponsible gaming brother, jewels stolen by blackguard, and a poker. One wonders what kind of an editor Ms South had.I would certainly not spend more money on this author; I can reread Georgette Heyer, with more satisfying results."
4,The Official game of the movie,"This game basically embarks you on the plot of the movie, with movie cutscenes, characters, plots, and a few extra mission are thrown you way as you journey as either Obi-Wan or Anakin, switching in between missionsStoryline is very familar as it is tied to the movie, but the multiplayer duels makes up for it. It is an alright game but it can lose it's touch after a while."
5,D-Day the First Division,"My Dad, Donald Gurdison, a 5th Engineering Special Brigade soldier, landed with the 1st Divison on D-Day in the 5th wave. There are special monmuments for these two units on Omaha Beach just outside the side gate of the American Cemetery fence. This book filled in the gaps of the story after my visit. And I recognized many of the names from the exhibits. If you're heading to Normandie and you can, read this first. It's a wonderful account of some very brave people who saw the atrocities of war and served our country proudly"
4,Fun and interesting read,"This book is full of interesting facts about cats. It was a fun read, and I read it in one evening.I only have two complaints about it. First, there are no footnotes. Morris doesn't cite any of his sources.Second, he doesn't tell us why we say, ""Cat got your tongue?"" He answers several similar questions. He explains why we say, ""Let the cat out of the bag,"" and ""It's raining cats and dogs,"" but he doesn't tell us why the cat has our tongue. That's really important, you know.Anyway, I would recommend this book just because it's entertaining to read. I also read his book on Horse watching, which is just as good."
5,Love the novelty,"Super Mario Bros paraphernalia are hard to find. If you have a chid who loves Super Mario Bros, this is icing on he cake. These dolls materialize these characters."
5,hip hop production at its finest,hands down the best hip hop producer in the game... amazing beats!!! 5 stars... DONE!
2,elcectrict chainsaw mess,every time I use this saw the blade loosens and or loses the bolts have to spend lots of time hunting for them
2,It was about 150 pages too long.,"The book was exceedingly slow to start. The narratives were distracting. Tomasino wasn't as delicious as he thought he was. I had absolutely little empathy for any of the characters. Overall, it left me flat and the premise had so much promise."
2,Disappointing,"I had such high hopes for this book when I read the synopsis. However, by the second page, I was already turned off. The narration is incredibly pretentious and distracting while the story takes way too long to unfold. I did, however, enjoy the excerpts from Belladonna's diary which recounts the events of her imprisonment. If the rest of the book was as kinky and exciting as those parts, it would have been a great story. The book is worth a read simply for those areas (conveniently printed in italics which makes browsing extremely easy!), but you may want to skim the rest of the story."
3,"Sexy, decadent novel runs from red-hot to barely warm.","Rarely does a book cross my desk and leave with the proclaimation, ""It was OK."" BELLADONNA could have been great. It has a rich psychosexual dynamic, a new and interesting narrative voice (you can almost hear Tim Curry as Tomasino reading each line), and a plot that, while not uncommon, has enough of an interesting cast to keep it lively. Yet somehow, it falls flat. The ending is very trite, with the beautiful, menacing Belladonna transformed as if by a fairy godmother into a docile wife and mother who has ""let go"" of her past as conveniently as an Oprah Winfrey guest. The climax winds up very anti-climatic, a disappointment to most readers. If there were some kind of letting-go involved, for all the main characters, there might have been a greater release of tension for the reader as well. Read this book for its deep, blackened undercurrent of domination/submissive psychology and for its wonderful prose narration. Ignore the ending."
3,Fractured and unsatisfactory revenge,"I did like this book, it had its moments...BUT... the narrative style was incrediably distracting. First person removed is great for some stories but not one where the psychological condition of the main character is the prime motivator for the events to follow.When I finished the book I found myself disliking the character of Belladonna, not for what she did, but for what she did not do. The character was a cop-out, a mythical figure who very conveniently and without explanation, becomes human.There were too many facinating aspects of this story that were not addressed, and too many chapters about stupid adulterers and their come-uppances at Belladonna's hand. All in all an okay book, but one that was NOT about revenge. Definitely beach reading."
4,Very good read,"I love all things Amanda Quick, Jayne Ann Krentz and Jayne Castle. Affair was another fun read and look forward to many more books from this author in the future!"
5,I've enjoyed this several times!,"Each time I read 'Affair' I find it that much more enticing. First, I love the Alchemy side to the books. Chemistry is a love of mine and I thoroughly enjoy it's inclusion in the plot. Second, it seems so much more romantic to me when someone sees beyond the persona projected to even your closest relatives and sees the real person underneath. Last, I love books about the eldest, responsible child loving and caring for their younger siblings (don't I? My darlings?)."
3,This was not one of her best!!!,I was dissapointed in this book. It didn't really hold my attention. It took until the end of the story for the two main characters to finally profess their love for one another. It was too drawn out and not very romantic. I wouldn't recomened it.
1,COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO END---,"The heroine and her sister were irritating, the hero was uninspiring, the villain was a joke and the frequent scientific references were bland. There was no chemistry between the hero/heroine. This book was annoying enough on its own, but it was the narrator, Mary Peiffer, who really set my teeth on edge. The sad thing is part of the story line had possibilities. Ms. Quick could have done so much more with the mesmerism angle. Oh well.(FYI: Barbara Rosenblat is a much more enjoyable narrator of Amanda Quick's books.)"
1,An Interesting Piece of Fiction,"What a disappointment this work was. I read it primarily because of the excellent prior work of the award-winning author Tony Horwitz. It turned out to be a selectively-biased work of fiction presented to an unsuspecting public as non-fiction. When his work was read on National Public Radio, there were so many complaints about the inaccuracies in it, that NPR added a disclaimer to their broadcast. Horwitz, for some undisclosed personal reason, appears to hate people from the South and attacks them with the subtlety of a World War II propagandist. Here is hoping that the very talented Mr. Horwitz will abandon such cheap shots in the future and return to the quality work for which he has been rightly honored in his more lucid past."
4,Beneath Scarlett's Skirt,"Confederates In The Attic is an enjoyable charge through history and society. The author mixes humor, irony and some serious social observations about a New South who is still debating the Lost Cause. The book tended to stall in North Carolina and at Shiloh. There are some Gone With The Wind gems and a facinating piece about a living Confederate widow. The themes of why the South still dwells on the war are redundant. That is balanced by the author's playful and humorous observations on smaller aspects. You'll enjoy the battle."
5,Awesome book!,"Absolutely fascinating journalism, that I could not force myself to put down. Tony Horwitz is a marvelous writer and story teller. Fresh and insightful perspective concerning the Civil (North) or War between the States (South). No matter how little or great your subject knowledge, expect to be surprised and rewarded with a great read."
5,Confederates in the Attic,The story was very interesting. Tony Horwitz is an exceptional non-fiction writer. His journey through the modern South with the influences of the Civil War was very enlightening. Bought this for a long road trip and was very disappointed to find disc 8 so badly damaged we could not listen to it. Disc 12 was also damaged.
1,Boring ......,"A disclaimer: I did not complete this book. Got about halfway and lost interest. This book is both boring and trite, and frankly doesn't shed much light on why the conferacy continues to facinate so may people in my opinion. In this case you can actually judge the book by its cover - the ugly guy on the cover is a good indication of what you will read in this book - a sordid story."
3,"ENTERTAINING, FUNNY, INFORMATIVE,.. ALSO BIASED.. INSULTING","As a Civil War Buff and reenactor, I, as well as most of my fellow reenactors, owe a debt of gratitude to Horowitz for plugging our hobby and preservation efforts. However, his personal anti-southern bias as expressed on page 157 seems to be the motive for him seeking out the weirdest, wackiest people he could find South of the Mason Dixon line and casting them as typical civil war buffs and ""Neo Confederates"" ( which by the way isn't very flattering as the only other ""Neo"" I've heard of is ""Neo-Nazi""). Needless to say most of the negative reviews come from the South, and a lot of the glowing ones come from people whose preconcieved notions of guntoting yellow teeth racists rednecks where fullfulled by this book."
5,Not your typical Civil War Book,"This is a highly entertaining romp of a book. It is a must for Civil War buffs, especially those, like myself, who enjoy tramping around on battlefields, cemetaries, etc. Tony Horwitz combines facts, trivia, and humor as he describes his foray into the Confederacy. I enjoyed every word and was sorry to get to the end of the book.P.S. The chapter on Civil Wargasm is not to be missed!"
1,Multi-Pass this one up,"I'm totally frustrated. While billed to be the perfect home office machine, I cannot get the thing to print reliably. I have tried reloading the software several times. The manual is of little use as I follow the troubleshooting hints only to end up with ""Call the manufacturer"". Each time I turn my PC off I have to reload the software to print again - if it allows me to reload. Further, the ink cartridge ran out after only printing about 50 pages."
5,One of Many Top Choices,"There are a lot of good recordings of both Handel's Water Music and his Music for the Royal Fireworks lurking out there -- renditions by The English Concert, Tafelmusik and the venerable Collegium Aureum, among others. Oh, and vintage Marriner and Academy of St. Martin in the Fields for modern instrument versions. This disc easily joins that elite bunch with rousing and well-played performances of these Baroque musical icons. Suffice it to say the Water Music is played with exquisite smoothness while the Fireworks Music is loaded with punch and percussion. The coupling of the two and the Naxos price make this album almost impossible to beat. Highly recommended."
3,This release simply proves how great ABBA was.,"And I mean that. Much has been made of Benny and Bjorn as songwriters (and they were great) and producers (practically unparalleled in their field), but this live concert has the same songs and production values as an ABBA concert, but it's missing something.That something, of course, is Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid ""Frida"" Lyngstad. The female half of ABBA is noticeably missing in this otherwise sparkly package of Benny and Bjorns hits. Male singers Anders Glenmark and Tommy Körberg have the much easier job of replacing Benny and Bjorn, but Helen Sjöholm and Karin Glenmark simply cannot live up to the voices they are trying to replicate.That's not to say this disc is awful. A&A; have had the much higher profile in the years since ABBA's breaking up, so it is nice to see B&B; shine and the music and production do make them shine. It's just too bad the performers chosen aren't *quite* up to the same level."
4,A white hot exploration of transgressive love,"With his withered hand and disfiguring pock marks, Stalin didn't really meet anyone's ideal of a good looking man. True, the beourgeois standards of the West put all the emphasis on surface gloss, generally ignoring ideological virility. But even by the more human standards of Marxist Leninism, Stalin was kind of a troll.But Hoxha saw something beyond the cabbage leavings on Stalin's tunic; Hoxha understood that the Little Georgian had it going on. Reading between the lines in this erotic Roman a Clef is a pleasant enough way to spend an afternoon. Hoxha's gaze is unrelenting in contemplating the object of his obsession, and the text crackles with the weight of Hoxha's true ardor pushing against the flimsy bonds of ideological decorum.Read it aloud to your favorite cadre, and hammers to sickles, you'll be getting busy like a Red Army Tank division in Budapest.Hot!"
3,Simple and pretty,This is a simple dark purple. No shimmer or glitter - one coat will do the trick. It's a great color but it's not anything special.
1,$27.99? Are you kidding?,I love OPI and know that this particular item from Action Packaged Inc. is grossly overpriced. In a local store this would only be $8.50. Shop elsewhere; this merchant is ripping you off! On Amazon you can find this for less!
4,Great product wrong color,"OPI has great products. The only problem, they change the color lots too frequencly. Same color name, differnet color.Definietly disappointed with this color,not the same as I ordered before."
5,Wonderful color!,"OPI makes some of the best nail polish, hands down. I knew I wanted a new color, and I actually saw a lady wearing this shade and asked her what it was. The color on the picture was very accurate, its a very shiny apple red, and can be darker after several coats. For some reason, on OPI's website, this looked to be a more bright pink color which is why I was wary. But its very red, and shiny! I love it!Just like any nail polish, it will chip after a few days and will dry out eventually (I have other older OPI colors), but it seems to last longer and be a better quality from what I've purchased from the drug store.Did I mention how wonderful this color is?? Its amazing!"
2,Not worth the price,I got this nail polish clearence wanted to try it out. I did my nails with Relvon nail polish and this one at the same time i notice that the Relvon is just as good as OPI because they both last same amount of time. Actually you can get nail polish for two dollars at your local drugstore that works just as well as this. Paying $8 for nail polish is stupid.
4,I love the color,I love this color actually its darker than the picture but i like it. i just thought it would be a little lighter but its still a nice color I'm wearing it right now its a great buy
3,Red nail polish that looks like... red nail polish,"My wife bought this through my account. I didn't know. When it arrived, I was hoping to find either the Uranium Ore in a can or some handerpants.I opened the box and it was nail polish.I thought, ""Wow... Amazon really F-ed up this time.""When my wife came home, she was ecstatic to find her ""Quarter of a Cent-Cherry"" nail polish sitting on the coffee table. She painted her nails. It looks like red nail polish to me. She corrected me, saying it is ""Quarter of a Cent-Cherry.""So, I painted our dog's nails. My wife said, ""Why did you paint the dog's nails red?"" See, it IS red!"
5,Can't Go Wrong with OPI,"I like this color, but it is a little darker than what is pictured - more like a dark beige."
5,GREAT,"I bought this as a ""test"" color for the shade I used at my friend's home. I was exactly the same, I reordered 3 additional bottles, I kept 2 and shipped her 2."
3,So so..,"I normally love a OP I nail polish. Although this nail polish in the picture looks beautiful, I was not that impressed with it when I got it. It is doll, not as bright, and seemed to chip very easily."
5,Nail,"5 stars, for as I said that this is the only nail polishthat I purchase.yes, i would tell you to buy"
4,Pretty :),"This is really pretty nail polish! It's clear with sparkles and it's amazing. The sparkles are so tiny and in the sunlight they shine a hundred different colors. It's really beautiful. It dries fairly fast and it has a nice consistency and an awesome thick brush so it goes on in just one or two strokes and you don't have to keep screwing with it to make it even. It stays on for a decent amount of time, too.The only gripe I could have about this product is that when I ordered it I thought it was opaque. So... it's not really what I meant to buy. But anyway, I still love it!"
2,No Peel? Deal.,"This nail polish is the right color, right brand, and everything I wanted for a lesser price than that of in a salon. However, it does not stay on the nail...It seems that it had been used or something before it was sent. There was dried polish on the outside, as well as around the rim to the bottle. No matter what I do to my nails (using nail polish remover to remove any oils on the nail prior to application, using a base coat, etc.) it peels off within a day...like literally peels off. I've seen this in salons before, where the cosmetologist or whoever added something to the lacquer to spread it further, and the end result was bubbling/peeling...wondering if this happened to mine? Won't buy from here again for O.P.I."
1,Very disappointing,"I loved this OPI color years ago, Java Mauve-A, and when I found it again on Amazon, I had to have it! When it arrived, I was very disappointed to see that the color was not right although the bottle was labeled Java Mauve-A. Even looking at it online (and I know that monitors have variations in the displays), it had the right kind of light latte brown. OPI's Java Mauve-A is a wonderful neutral color. Now I have this polish and it cannot be returned because of shipping policies. I don't know what happened, maybe OPI changed their color formulation? Anyway, best to choose your polish in person I guess, even if you think you are familiar with the product."
5,Favorite go-to polish!,"I paint my nails on a weekly basis, and OPI is easily the best brand I've used. This color is my favorite - very vibrant and goes on easily. I noticed when I'd go to a salon to get my nails done, I picked this color repeatedly [not deliberately though]. After 5 or 6 times I decided I should probably have this color at home.Just be careful purple-lovers! This is not really a purple, more of a fuchsia/pink."
5,Perfect color,This has to be one of my favorite colors! Love it! It is the perfect blend of grey and sparkles.
5,Dodger blue...,"They should of named this dodger blue so one night we were going to a dodger game and I wanted to do my nails so I boufht this color worjs great and when I recieved it, it was not old or anything."
5,A favorite,"This is one of my favorites. The color I'm really not a Waitress is a dark red maroon color with a little shimmer/glitter to it. Opi nail polishes go on smooth and easy. Sometimes, depending on the color I have found I can get by with using only one coat. They dry relatively quick, certainly not longer than any other kind of polish. I never use a top coat with Opi nail polishes because they dry bright and shiny. I really like Opi nail polishes. The mini sizes are just the right size to try and not have a lot left over if you don't like it or rarely paint your nails.Well worth their money.enjoy."
5,"Rich, dark purple color -- beautiful!","This is a great color, particularly for fancy outings or late-nights on the town. It covers well, dries quickly, and makes my nails look incredible. I've received many, many compliments on my nail color while wearing this selection."
3,Gorgeous color . . . but . . .,"this nail polish starts chipping almost immediately! Even when I got it applied by a professional manicurist. What am I doing wrong??? I have much better luck with longlasting Revlon Color Stay nail polish, though the color selection is poor. Sigh . . . wish I could make this OPI nail polish last."
4,Very good part,"The picture was very clear and I liked very much the manufacture also, I received the part on time without any problem.Once I received I just install to the car and it's worked without any problem. Thanks for the job let's keep working like this satisfying correctly the customer."
1,Died after two months,We bought this Braun toothbrush 9 OCT 2009. It died 17 JAN 2010. Worked fine when it was working. Now it doesn't work at all. Maybe we just got a lemon. Other Braun electrics we've had lasted much loger.
5,A good electric toothbrush for the money,"I bought a Braun because I had one before and it lasted 15 years! This is a powerful little toothbrush and for what it cost I think it's a bargain. It may not last 15 years, but I may not either!"
3,"Great Idea, could be built better.",I bought this mouse for the auto fire toggle built in. I FPS this was a great advantage as the autofire is hardwired into the mouse itself. it lasted about 6-8 months before the right click piece that went into the mouse was broken making it hard to right click. The mouse feel very plastic like as well and requires a perfect flat surface to use it on. Grip was comfortable as well as I have larger hands. If they fixed the clicking problem I would buy again.
4,Beltin' in out,"Tony has one of those awesome, soulful voices reminiscent of the 70s. He has a fresh interpretation of the blues, as he blends the styles of the great blues men he has sat behind. I especially like ""I Got a Thing About That Thing that You Got"". Yeah!"
4,More good material on Network Design,"I initially read Howard's RFC2072, and later attended a CID course that he taught. He got off track at times in this book (just like the course), but always very worthwhile subjects. Howard has shown his depth of experience in Network Design, and this book enjoys a welcome spot on my technical bookshelf. If he publishes an advanced book on multi-homing issues with and without Firewalls, I'll definitely pick up a copy."
2,Not exactly a page-turner,"This is the first of Michael Palmer's books that I have read. It was interesting enough to keep me reading. I finished it in no time flat, but it was not captivating. It lacked real excitement and ended too abruptly. I never connected with Harry, and at times I wished Dickenson would just arrest him and get it over with. As a graduate student in Health Administration I was excited but disgusted by the whole managed care sub-plot. Wow. That took a creative imagination."
5,my first michael palmer book,I couldn't put the book down. I so loved it. I finished it in 1 day. I recommend this to the night owl at the hospital who are bored to death on a slow night shift!!!
1,Long time DW fan: don't waste your money.,"I've had six DW games since I started playing them way back about 8 years ago. This is probably the worst. Of course, because it's empires, it has no musou mode, which is the best part of DW. Because of that, you can't really progress characters nearly as much, such as getting awesome weapons and things. Also, the 'strategy' of course isn't really strategy. You just pick which battles to fight. And the one aspect that makes it utterly boring is that there are not nearly enough people in each battle. I spend more time running trying to find enemies than fighting, versus old DW3 xtreme legends where I would once in a while end up with 1,000+ kills. Don't buy."
4,awesome game,the game is awesome and got a great price! shipping was very fast and the game dident work on a friends console but upon inserting it into my own it works great. all i can ask for. im very satisfied with this purchase
2,Appropriate for Middle School,I bought this book hoping that I would find an authoritative reference. It appears to be more of a children's book on a sixth grade level. This was a bitter disappointment.
5,for the price you can't go wrong,It's great for the price and it is compatible with with webtv plus.It was easy to set up and use and is a great basic printer if your like me and always said I'll never use a computer this printer is nice I hooked it up and was glad for the first time I did something on the computer without my ten year old sons help! it prints text well ok image quality and long ink life.
3,Great while it lasted,"This was a sturdy little printer--for about eighteen months. It was great for documents, so-so with the color, a disaster withphotos, but I used it for basic b/w printing 98% of the time.Then---sudden death. Something fizzled with the mechanism that moves the cartridge. Repair would run more than the cost of the printer. Wish I could recommend this as more than a back-up machine, but can't."
3,Walkin' In The Sand...,"Yep, those evil nazis are at it again! This time, they have the gall to rise from the grave as flesh-munching zombies! Unlike SHOCK WAVES, these lumbering cadavers crawl forth from the desert sands instead of the ocean floor. It seems they are guarding a ton of nazi gold from WW2. Enter four college students who decide to ditch school in order to hunt down and claim the treasure. The opening scene shows two babes who visit the oasis for a swim, only to end up as lunch. The zombies themselves ain't bad, though they should definitely have been in it more! There are long periods of dullness that cry out for a gruesome attack or two! The ending is a hurried affair that seems thrown-together. While there are certainly far superior zombie epics out there, OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES isn't the worst..."
3,if you watch in a certain way,"If you watch this in a certain way, with your tongue in cheek, ready for a pastiche of almost unrelated scenes knit together into a plot, willing to look aside and admire the beauty of the sand shots and the classy interiors when things get boring, able to throb along with the drum/organ soundtrack, ready for some shocks, willing to accept (and enjoy) the limitations of a low budget film, well ... this film just might change your life! All of Jess Franco's films, even his ""bad"" ones, make me happy. I was laughing all the way through this - till the end. What else do you want? It's art meets the cannibal zombies."
4,Good product!,****Almost flawless design. This is a beautiful peice that only needed real wood lacquered handle to achieve perfection. The faux wood adds the right color scheme but leave the feel cheap to the touch. STILL DEFFINATLY RECOMMEND!
3,Full (wide) tang or 'rat tail' tang?,Anyone here who knows anything about swords will understand my question. Does this sword have a wide tang or a rat tail tang. Wide is GOOD - rat tail cheap and dangerous in my book.
4,was worth the dollars invested great products and great attention from the vendor recommended 100%,was worth the dollars invested great products and great attention from the vendor recommended 100%was worth the dollars invested great products and great attention from the vendor recommended 100%
3,Good but greedy!,Found this version of the multipass to be a reliable machine. But it DOES USE ALOT OF INK! If you think of purchasing the multipass do yourself a favor and get the 6000 series which is the laser copier.
1,4 words...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Definately got suckered into this one! Had it for a year and a half and still have yet to get a good print! I am self employed and do alot of business cards, flyers, etc. For even the simplest things, I get black smudges on everything, jammed paper almost all the time, and the color is always off, usually WAY off. Cartridges evaporate almost instantly. It's loud and slow and photos aren't all that great. Canon has no interest in helping the problem(s) either. Sounds like I'm not the only one who got had by all the great reviews."
3,Its a nice printer,But over time the quality of the pictures printed seemed to drop. Nice printer while it lasted though. Although compared to the printers of today its slow and has no USB port so you'd be better off without it anyway.
2,Paper Eater,"I purchased the BJC-6000 because I loved my BJC-620 my wife took over after she got her own computer. I like the idea of seperate ink cartridges that can be replaced individualy. However, my BJC-6000 has been in the shop 3 times because of constant paper jamming. The machine would not accecpt the paper correctly every time, and when it did take, it came out crooked. The 2nd time it went in, they corrected the problem which lasted about 3 weeks. Then, one day, it snatched in a page and managed to crumple it up and damage the print head in the process. Ink all over the interior resulted in replacement of the platten. Insult to injury was added on when I was charged for a new print head even though the machine was still under warranty. I may have purchased a lemon. I am dissapointed in the BJC-6000, especially after I had good results with the BJC-620."
1,Blandest Meal in Recent Memory,"Mott seems to have used every cliche known to the English language in this slow-moving novel. Her use of the word ""pittance"" to describe her child support was lacking. She would have been better served to say that it was her ""reason for living"" Now that's sarcasm. As a first and last time reader of Mott, I feel her story line moves slowly, and her ending is anti-climactic. If I had known I would be reading a cookbook, I would have chosen Fanny Farmer."
2,Misses the target...but still entertains,"Davidson's recipes are without doubt the fruit of this series. It is obvious that Davidson feels the culinary portion of her writing as she paints clear images of her cooking. This makes cooking along with the book fantastically surreal. However, the divorce and who-done-it story lines seem a bit corny rather than moving. Yet, this is a quick read. I would suggest reading one Davidson novel for the general idea and checking out the recipes of her remaining books."
3,On the audio book fence...,"I have nothing to base this on other than some old tapes of classic radio dramas. Still, I decided to join Audible.com for a free trial. Nothing personal, but the reading by Mr. Glover did very little for me. I enjoyed the stories...but there were these long breaks where I though my Kindle Fire was fritzing out...it was just REALLY long pauses. I imagine there was a reason, but I found it distracting in the middle of a story. The attempt to add bits of music to build the mood was more distracting than anything else. I may try one more title, but I was largely unimpressed. Good stories...just lackluster presentation."
4,Excellent tools for consultant,"I appreciate very much this book as a support of my activity of consultant. I have found not easy to connect his content with the content of the main Senge Book, The fifth discipline"
2,wouldnt bother with it.,this thing leaked...not too bad but always had to have a towel set under it.not its fault...its the fault of the general design of the actual filter.
5,Great DVD,"Julie Andrews gives a really risky and full performance. The transfer is really beautiful and the sound is great in 5.0 surround. The movie is very long, and many would say overproduced, but enough about what has already been said about it for the last 35 years. This is a great show of Ms. Andrews' talents with many many huge production numbers. Among my favorites are ""Burlington Bertie"", ""My Ship"", ""The Saga of Jenny"" and ""Limehouse Blues"". Michael Kidd did great work, with Julie really putting out in dance numbers. A perfect addition to a film library...the big numbers are all right there to be seen in the best possible way. Bravo, Julie!"
3,Only for completists,"I purchased this DVD as a lifelong LZ fan. It really dosen't contain anything I havent seen or heard before. My advice is to purchase ""How the West was Won"". You will have most of the video footage in this DVD. The interviews were OK but I really don't need music reviewers telling me why LZ is good or not. Buy this only if you are trying to acumulate every bit of material regarding LZ. I also had trouble playing Disc 1. Not sure why."
3,"Nice, but not the chair for big guys","The information presented on Amazon called this chair ""Oversized"". I wouldn't use that term to describe it. The description also lacked a mention of the chair's listed weight limit. I went ahead and ordered it but when it arrived I found out that the weight limit is a mere 240 lb. Not what I'd call ""oversized"".The chair isn't bad, just not for big guys who stand 6'6"" and are well beyond 240 lb."
2,Ugly Novel,"I was shocked when I started reading the reviews for this book. I honestly thought maybe there was a different book with the same name. This book is like all of Iris Johansen's novels (the couple I have managed to finish anyways. I keep thinking they'll get better but they don't.) The plot sounds deceptively intriguing, but fails to live up to the back cover. Strong willed girl endangers the life of herself and everyone around her to get revenge, and the rich powerful attractive stranger (almost always a murderer or criminal, but no one seems to let that bother them) steps in to help her and they fall in love within minutes. All this is conveyed through pure dialog. And poorly written, sometimes painful dialog at that. It's like reading a bad soap opera script. It's not a romance novel, it's not a suspense novel, it's not a well-written novel. So if you're looking for any of those, keep looking."
5,The best action-drama book I've read in my life!!!,This book is a out standind novel I've read. I have read over 50+ books in my life & I'm still looking for a better book than this one.
2,A rare raspberry...,"Usually, I can't get beyond page three of a book that contains the expression: ""She glanced up at the tall, leggy brunette in the doorway,"" but I am waiting to see how Nell Calder (ick, what a bland-o name, as are all the others) looks when the bandages come off. After that, I'm off, to another book. For a ""thriller"" that should be as springy as a tiger on its prey, I'm finding this one nearly dead in the water. Hasn't anyone noticed how often people are seen disappearing down long corridors? Best word to describe this book: desultory. Sorry."
4,Memorable,"I love Iris Johansen. She is one of my favorite authors. I have not read the Ugly Duckling for a few years and yet it has stuck with me ever since.It is one of those stories that any unattractive girl might dream of, omitting some of the tragedy of course. Everyone wants to be beautiful and feel desirable. This story is about one woman who gets that chance. Her life has been ripped apart by tragic circumstances, and yet she is forced to carry on to uncover the mystery. Like other books by Iris Johansen, you will not be disappointed with the twist. I highly recommend reading this one, but just to let you know. It is not as suspenseful as many of her other books. I think this may have been her first book to cross over into the romantic suspense genre. The Eve Duncan books are still her best for suspense. The killing game is by far her best work yet in my opinion."
5,Love it!!,"This is a great novel. it was so suspensefull, sad, romantic and the story just flows naturally...This was an awesome read, I can re-read this and enjoy it still."
4,Eve Duncan series exciting,l just love Iris Johansen - especially her Eve Duncan books. I have been trying to read all of the Eve Duncan series and I discovered I had already read this one.
4,What a plot!,This book had a great plot that held my attention through the very end. I had a hard time wanting to go to sleep because I did not want to put the book down. I will continue to read these great books as long as they keep coming out.
3,Light Comedy,this is a fun little film. I love Michael Caine in anything....he shines in this comedy about relationships....He and Maggie Smith are an old married couple from Show business haunting a lovely row house in New York...James Spader is the unknowing buyer of the house and they become entertwined....cute.
3,"60% good, 40% Blah-Blahs","Many of these mini-stories are funny and grab your attention. And then along comes ANOTHER one that goes ""When I was growing up in the 60's...""You guys do realize that 1960 was 50 years ago, right? Some of the readers of this book have *grandparents* that say things like, ""When I was growing up in the 60's, blahblahblah..."" Can you *really* not write 500 words to modern boys without saying that?Anyway, we like to use it as a sampler -- read something funny or captivating or profound in the book, then go to the library and get out two or three other things by that author.We also like that each offering is short, and many are funny, and did I mention they are short? I have a son who takes little homework breaks where he gobbles a snack, and he likes to read one or two of these and then get back to work."
5,Great Read!,"As a teacher, I enjoy using selections from this book to read to my class. This is an excellent collection of stories and illustrations that can be great for older readers and writers."
2,MacArthur Park was only the beginning,"Jimmy Webb is a very under exposed composer. I never heard of most of the songs on this cd, but they, all but one, were the same mood and excellence of MacArthur Park. If I hadn't head them on this cd I wouldn't have ever heard them. They are my kind of music."
3,Great content but needs better editing and scholarship.,"Some of the first hand narratives contained in ""Valiant Women"" are the stuff of great drama. Most leave you wanting to know more about the narrator, but this book doesn't give it to you. When was each piece written in respects to the incident(s)? Where was it originally included? Was it written, perhaps, exclusively for this volume? Where is the individual attribution, save for a very generalized ""bibliography"" at the end, which tells us very little. Again, some of these stories are almost overwhelming in their power (e.g. ""Elsa Smuskevich"", ""Peter Forman"", to name a few). These witnesses to history deserved far better editorial presentation."
3,changed design,"I bought this puppet several years ago for an educational program I do about bees and beekeeping. Unfortunately, I have lost it so I bought a replacement. I was disappointed because although the original was basically anatomically correct, the new one has small, glassy eyes instead of the correct large dark compound eyes of the first one. I wish they would redesign it back to the original."
5,great reference and starter,"Having coded in C++ for years with only a small amount of experience in C#, this book was a great asset. It gives a good overview of the basics of C# and doesn't gloss over important details like space requirements and (optional) memory management.The book is also a great reference for the .NET Framework. Obviously it does not give an in depth explanation of every concept, being only 118 pages long. Instead it references a number of .NET libraries that you should look into depending on what you're trying to do. I love this concept! Now whenever I want to try something new, I first check in the Pocket Reference to see what I should look into, then either go to MSDN or crack open a larger, less navigable manual.Recommended for all those relatively new to C# and in need of a good starting point in the .NET Framework."
5,Purchasing 3 edition,Have use this book over the decades for traveling most States and Providences of Canada. Will be using the 2000 edition for planning and navigation on our 8 week summer vacation. A must for every road travel addict. Also a great reference to look up where people live and the latest floods and storms.
4,"As Described, No Surprises","Good quality pins, as described. We plan to use them for backpacking. There are always a few things - wet socks, whatever - to attach to the outside of my backpack."
3,It is great,My family just loves the Big Bang Theory and I am thrilled to be able to buy it especially for my grandsons!
5,One of the best sit-coms ever... for a certain group,"I absolutely love this show. Every episode has me writhing in pain from laughing so hard. That being said, to fully appreciate this show, you have to be well versed in the geek world. It may be enjoyable to everyone, but theres that special group of people that this show is really for."
5,Another great season!,"These shows don't get old for me; they're just as funny the second and third time as the first. The special features are also enjoyable, especially the interview with David Saltzberg, the consulting scientist. I highly recommend getting the DVDs if you enjoy watching the show on TV!"
2,Disk not playing,"I am extremely disappointed. I ordered all of the season of my favorite show, and the second disc played the first three episodes but the second three would not play at all. I couldn't watch the 3 episodes because the disk was messed up."
2,Episodes will not play,I was able to view only part of the discs. 9 episodes on 4 different discs would not play even after I cleaned the discs.
3,Just Plain Funny,"This show is a hit. There are some references to sex that, if removed (or toned down) would not detract from the hilarity. My oldest daughter watches, but I have to see the episode before my youngest is allowed to watch. Overall a good, funny and entertaining show."
4,Funny physics,"Finally, we have some jokes about physicists. Good to know that some years studing physics can cause some typical behavior. The Big Bang Theory is about our believes and difficulties to handle the routine. Relationship with friends and lovers. It is extremely well based with perfect references to modern Physics.Unforgeable to see a couple arguing about how to grow up the kids, if using Standard Model of Particles or Super Strings. Religion is replaced by Physics critizing the society. Perfect parallell."
3,Great! except one cd,"1 out of the 4 cds I ordered was damaged. I ordered season 2 of the big bang theory and was disappointed to discover that the 2nd disc of the season did not work at all. I know that the cds have been used, but for one not to work at all seems weird."
5,Funniest Show on the Air,"I can watch these episodes over and over. Sheldon is the geek some of us wish we could be, and some of us are afraid we are."
5,I feel like Leonard and Sheldon and Howard all mixed together,I was hooked after watching the first season. I missed a few shows and bought the first season. Once the second Season went on sale I had to have it too. The classic episodes are in this season. Paper Scissors Rock Lizard Spock love that one. And Penny is easy on the eyes. What more do you want. Buy it.
5,Brilliant!,This is absolutely one of my favourite series! This box is a must have for sure and the best thing of all: Portuguese subtitles! hehehehe Yay! C'mon Brazilian fans!
2,disc stopped working,I was so excited to get this because I became hooked on the show...I got 3 episodes into the 2nd disc before it stopped working. the last few episodes on there either play with a black screen or don't play at all. very annoying and disappointing.
1,"Decent story, poor animation.","I bought this thinking the story sounded good, and the price was low enough for me to take a chance... I'm sorry I did. While the audio was decent (some cliche lines) the animation made me think of a poorly done flip book. You had characters passing through each other, movements were jerky. The drawings looked like something out of the Sunday funnies.All in all, I should have saved the cash and bought something else."
2,so-so,"A good conversation starter for a book club, but something I would not have finished except that it was on the reading list for our club."
5,Wickedly funny!,"THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND is a fairytale that takes a wrong turn and quickly turns into a nightmare. During a whirlwind courtship, Dennis is everything a woman could want in a man---loving, attentive, affluent, an excellent lover. But once the narrator marries him, he becomes a bumbling, accident-prone ""dangerous husband."" Beneath all its sly and wicked humor, THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND takes a poignant look at relationships between men and women, and examines what happens after the romance of courtship wears off and two people are subjected to the reality of every day life living together, and the feeling of maybe, just maybe, wanting to kill your beloved because of his or her annoying tics. Although this novel might be perceived differently by men, both men and women should read THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND."
1,FLIGHT OF PASSAGE CRASHES UPON TAKEOFF.,"This book lacks any clear insight or revelation about anyone or anything. Quite simply, it is cynical, derivative pap."
5,A great storey,I flew across the US about 15 years ago in a light plane. The book brought some great memories back. This is not just a book for aviation enthusiasts. The story of two brothers and the connection between them and their father is beautiful. I highly recommend this book.
3,good but not for the little ones,"I bought this product when my baby was 10 months old. She loves it, but all she does is biting it. Althoug some reviews here state this could be chewable, but I really don't like my baby chewing these soft foam blocks, my baby already got teeths at that moment and she could bite the small parts down, and some blocks have paint, she could chew the paint down too. I don't think these could be ate. So I save it for her when she grow up and know how to play with it."
3,"Great blocks, but container could be a problem","These are great blocks, but the container they come in is kinda flimsy. The latches on the box broke off and I considered that a choking hazard. Other than that my child plays with these often."
2,"Poor quality, sorry to say.","A good electric kettle is a kitchen essential. The Breville is landfill-bound sooner rather than later. This made-in-China kettle doesn't reliably shut off once the water's reached a boil. It'll just boil and boil and boil and boil and boil until YOU shut it off. Indicator light? Nice flashing lightning-storm effect during the six months it lasted (it flashed beautifully for no reason). Now there's no indicator light at all. Is it on? Is it off? Who can tell? This kettle is slow to heat. Slower than a microwave, slower than my range. Disappointing right out of the box."
2,shorted out,My Breville kettle shorted out after a year or so and I am unable to fix it. I believe that others have had this problem.
2,NOT TOO SURE,I was seriously thinking of purchasing this kettle so I went to William Somona to check it out in person before purchasing on Amazon. Although this kettle has all the features I want what steered me away from purchasing the kettle was the way the lid opens and closes. The store had two of the same model kettles on display one of the kettles I could not open the top latch. I actually had to pry the lid up. Then it would open a couple times and then get stuck closed again. The other kettle on display was just fine. This lead me to believe that probably with use you'd have to pry the lid up when you add water. So for now I will keep looking.
5,Great fast water kettle,"This is our favorite water kettle ever. It is fast, efficient and looks good on your counter. This kettle has become our go-to source for boiled water, pushing us to find uses for boiled water that we never knew we had. We had thoguht of getting one of those instant hot water dispensers, but with this kettle that would seem to be a waste."
5,Great buy,"This product works very well . No plastic taste . When you get it , please do as the manufactor said fill with water turn it on , when this water comes to a boil discard it , now you are ready to boil water. Enjoy"
1,Quit working after 7 months,"Our family loved this - in fact it is one of the best ""works as advertised"" appliances we've ever owned. It boils water so quickly we will never go back to a stovetop teakettle. Unfortunately, it (twice) blew out the outlet we plugged it into, and then quit working itself after 7 months. The vendor we purchased it from just stopped selling it."
3,Not as durable as it looks,"I have bought two of this exact model in the last two years. I chose this because it is much handsomer than most other electric kettles and seemed very sturdy and non-plastic (so non-toxic). We lived in the UK and got hooked on electric kettles, plus we can be absent minded and so love the automatic shut-off feature. We use it for tea once or twice a day, and also to boil pasta water for cooking. Unfortunately, despite its high price point and sturdy materials and look, each of our two kettles bit the dust after only a little more than a year. What a disappointment! I hate to heave the whole thing into the landfill. I wish they could repair it (or make it sturdier to begin with)."
5,Awesome Kettle!!,"I have had my kettle for less than a week, and I have used it every night. It is nice and sturdy and obviously of great quality. You push the button and the lid opens smoothly. It heats up quickly and is holds a large amount of water for what I want/desire. The light lights up the amount indicator nicely; would be nice of that was lit all the time instead of only when you turn on the kettle, but that is such a small issue given the quality of this kettle. I only had to run one pot of water to boil to get the smell out and every pot since has been perfect. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
2,Lasts about a year and a half.,"I purchased one of these for my home and liked it enough to buy a second one for use at work. About 18 months later, the first one started failing to shut off consistently. I'd come back to the kitchen 20 minutes later and it would still be boiling -- dangerous. Shortly thereafter, the lid on the one at work began getting stuck open and can be frustrating to close. So far I haven't replace either of them, but they continue to degrade. The light on my kettle at home now flashes frantically while boiling. I would've recommended these kettles heartily a year ago, but they are too expensive to replace every two years."
2,Loved it .... until it stopped working!,"A fine product, but it only lasted for a little more than 3 years of light use when I've read many reviews about tea kettles lasting 10 years of daily use. Tea kettles are very simple but highly functional devices. Overall I was happy with the device, but when it stopped working I tried to scrape the metal connections to no avail after reading that advice on the internet (you should try it before throwing yours out). It did not work work me and when I called Breville there was nothing to do but throw it out .. very disappointing."
2,I EXPECTED THIS TO LAST,"I was seeking an electric kettle with a lid that would be easy to open and thought this was well designed and durable. However, within six months, my boiled water started to have a metallic taste and when I examined the interior, I was surprised to see that there was a ring of worn down metal that was probably the cause of the metallic taste of the hot water. I no longer had a receipt and it was past due any return policy date. Luckily, I purchased it from Bed, Bath, and Beyond and they gave me a store credit---no questions asked. Because they had a limited number/brands of electric kettles, I ultimately purchased an Aroma Hot H20 Xpress at another store. This kettle is terrific (so far) and the kettle performs as advertised: a kettle of water boils at the speed it would take to boil a cup of water. The lid is manual but it is easy enough to open for my arthritic fingers."
4,Good Kettle,This kettle is worth the money. It heat water very quickly. It does not have the plastic smell like some other brand. it is a keeper.
2,This book was kind of good.,"I thought this book was okay but I did learn a lot of things from it. I learned that mentally challenged kids are really not dumb like everybody thinks. They have their mind and own thoughts. All alchoholics are not bad either. Most people drink because they are stressed or because they are sad or something.I learned that you can never judge a person by what they look like. One person might dress with no clothes matching one another, but they could still have a great personality. I really liked the character Ronald because if he was real there could be a lot learned from him. Vernon was a good character because he was the one that liked him when no one else payed attention."
4,Crazy Lady Review,Crazy Lady was fun to read. My favorite character was Ronald because he tried so hard to learn to talk and he always behaved good. My favorite part of the story was at the end when Ronald was leaving and Vernon chased the truck so far just because he loved Ronald. At the beginning Vernon was embarrassed about Maxine and Ronald but by the end of the story he loved Ronald. Another good part was when Vernon threw the carnival to raise money for Ronald. That showed his real character. He cared so much about what his friends thought but he would never do anything to hurt anyone. I think Crazy Lady was a good book.
5,Crazy Lady! A Newbery Honor Book With Good Reason!,This is an amazing story. Just a flat out great book. Also I think that this book is good for all ages!
2,Crazy Lady,I didn't like the Crazy Lady book alot. It never really interested me. Although some parts at the end were good so I gave it 2 stars. My opinion changed alot about drinking. I know I will never get drunk now since I read the way Maxine acted when she was drunk.
1,Desperate,"After I had just read ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" for school reading points, I was so motivated for reading. The next book I picked out was this. It seemed good. Boy, was that ever a big mistake I made! Here's the plot. Vernon a boy helps the strange Maxine Flooter and her...uh ""mentally disordered"" son Ronald. Don't expect any more plot than that. This book was so slow nothing good ever happened. Routine happened all the time. Also, the ending was very predictable. The last three paragraphs were very desperate. About the only thing that kept me going for the last four chapters was seeing if Ronald would talk. If all that weren't enough, the language is too strong at times for a children's book. Just forget it."
4,Very nutmeg-y,"I guess I expected a spicier mix of spices, but this just smells/tastes like spiced nutmeg. But maybe that's what garam masala is supposed to taste like. In any case, I made a korma with this and other spices and it turned out ok, better than it had before without it, so I can't really complain too much. The korma just tasted a little too sweet, even with sour cream and garlic, and added black pepper and salt because it tasted bland. Someone should just make a powdered spice for korma, because I can't seem to get it right!"
4,"GOOD PRODUCT, GREAT SUMMERTIME VALUE!","Much nicer looking than the picture & the price can't be beat! Isaw just *one* of these types of planters in a home improvement storethat will not be named here with a price tag of...Notches on the bottom of the trio allow for fancier display, if you wish. I've just put mine along the porch railing, they look great. Removable plugs in the bottom for easy drainage & sturdy materials...but hey, I'm soon to run out of room! Order it already & get to gardening!"
3,Tron Legacy film,This is something you enjoy for the visuals and music more than the plot. The plot honestly is ridiculous. But the art design and action scenes are cool.
2,Disappointment,"This is a disappointing movie. Its simply a 2 hour demonstration for your 3D TV. Every single scene is just some object or person in the foreground and an extremely overused depth of field effect to accentuate the 3D. I watched the 2D version and it was pretty bad. The story was just a slightly modified version of the original. The effects were also pretty crappy. This movie was obviously made to sell 3D TVs and nothing more. Also, for some reason the animators of the people couldn't make their upper lips move. This was obvious and annoying.At least the soundtrack is decent."
5,Tron: Legacy,"Tron: Legacy. A complete Si-fi adventure. A fantastic addition to the Tron legacy. Perfect for a weekend geek fest. Unless you are just watching it for Olivia Wilde, but you will be satisfied in that department too."
2,not as advertized,"Supposed to be 3D. NOT! If you are looking to find a movie to play on your new 3D TV, this ain't it!"
3,Tron 3d not as good as expected,"After watching Step Up 3d, Legend of Guardians 3d, and Tangled 3d I was very excited to get Tron 3d. Unfortunately maybe I was expecting too much...it is kinda boring(too many scenes in this movie that go from awesome action to boring dialog) and the 3d wasn't that great. Good but not great. Maybe it just had too much competition in Tangled and Legend of the Guardians...if you have a 3d tv and can get it for like 15-17...(20 is stretching it)... then i say go ahead...my surround sound hasn't arrived yet, so I'm gonna try it again when it arrives. but then I didn't need surround for the other movies to be wowed...THE ACTION SCENES ARE GREAT THO...but not enuff of em...1/3 of movie i'd say. I actually fell asleep on this movie...so maybe I should watch the ending...but me falling asleep says alot..."
4,a great film if you do not expect the film to be epic,"This movie was not bad but it was not the best ether. Their are things to like about the film action, story, good actors, but i just can't get over the fact that this film they said was to be action packed epic climax that sort of thing which it was and was not i give it four stars because it deserves four stars for a least a good try but this movie fails to bet prince of persia and the sorcers appretice. This film is a good movie if you do not expect a star wars type movie or a matrix type movie because this movie does not compare to the matrix trilogy or star wars. But it is still worth a look."
5,Great,"I watched this movie in theaters and really liked it, so I decided to buy it once it came out. As a techno geek I want the best in technology without spending all my money. I was happy to find Tron: Legacy in blu-ray for so little money, and not only that but to also get the 3D version and a digital copy was a great win! And to add more it arrived in about 3 days."
5,Great sequel,"This movie is a great sequel to Tron and very well made. Great casting, excellent visuals, amazing score, great story. It's simply a well made movie, and the effort from everyone involved shows."
4,Entertaining!,Plenty of action and very nice special effects. Some of the performances could be better. Overall a very entertaining story for sci-fi fans.
1,Tron Legacy,"The 3D and cast are excellent. What is lacking is character development. So little is done to bring the audience into any identification of the characters. Though the look of it is great, the computer generated world becomes boring without any real variety, especially with lack of character development.... I'll never buy an Amazon 3D movie online again."
2,Retred of the original,"This movie essentially just follows the same path as the original.* ""User"" gets sucked into the Grid.* User forced to take part in the games.* User escapes into computer ""wilderness""* USer travels across vast ""wilderness"" in order to leave/confront final villian.* User excapes back to the real world.This movie, however, does have superior special effects, but the idea of a world inside a computer (that each program is a little digital person) just does not work in this day and age. Overall, just eye candy with the same dull plot as the first.(Of course, if the little ""program"" people constantly ""froze"", with little hour glasses evenly, when there were too many of them in a room at the same time, I would have found it at least a little more realistic.)"
2,Uhhhh... uhhh... uhhh...,"While I'm not a fanboy for Tron, I thought that this would be fun, or at least not an embarrassing father-son movie like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull; I was right about the latter (barely), but wrong about the former. The movie made no sense at all, and was ultimately terribly stupid. Kind of like Speed Racer, or something, but without the over-the-top CG."
1,Very Bad Movie,The special effect were good but the whole movie was bad. I like the 1st one had a some kind of story this one I could not understand what was about it.Wasted my Money I wish there would be a 3D rental but no one is renting them yet.
1,Too Bad,We were excited for the whole blu ray experience and found out that it skips through a lot of the movie. Not watchable
2,One of the worst 3d movie,"This is one of the worssssst 3D movie I'ever seen.70% of the scenses were shoot in 2D.They should tell up front that most of the scenses were shot in 2d, instead of being when it's played.If you're looking 3d movie, this is definitely not the one!"
3,Ok movie,"Without having seen the original, I found this movie to be enjoyable but not great. While there were lots of cool effects and action sequences, I would have enjoyed a more developed story."
3,Just blu,PLEASE give me just the bluray. I DO NOT want or need the 3d or dvd copies. I can't believe that the movie industry is forcing this crap on us. I will not purchase this bluray untill I can get JUST the bluray. Guess it will be another year before I buy and watch this movie.
3,The Maketing Control Program,"It's not that Tron Legacy wasn't good, it's just that it could have been so much better. The Tron character was reduced to a mere plot device that never fulfilled his promise. The story line was so lame that I viewed the screenwriters as journeymen hacks heavily influenced by Star Wars and working under the micro-management of the Disney marketing department.This movie was designed to be a transitional PRODUCT. It brought the Tron movie franchise to an end by killing off the main characters and served as a come-on to attract the children of those who loved the original movie to the new video game and cartoon series. I would love to see what a better writing team could have done with the opportunity to create this story."
5,Tron 3D,"Tron 3D... In my ""OPINION"", this is a great movie, and even better in 3D... however the movie was not made entirely in 3D. There are several 2D scenes so don't start freaking out thinking your tv broke or something. If you didn't like the movie in 2D your not gonna like it in 3D either... just the nature of the beast I suppose. I really liked the movie, I hope you give it a try."
5,Awesome in 3D!!!,"What an amazing experience, watching Tron in 3D Blu-Ray!! The picture was awesome, the sound was awesome, and the 3D technology was awesome.We keep watching it over and over again! And I am a huge movie collector...Also, I find it beneficial that the set comes with the regular Blu-Ray as well. This way my family can borrow it, or I can watch it in a different room.Well worth the price!! 100% recommended!!"
5,Tron DVD,"If you own a 3d tv then this movie is great to watch, but also has the regular DVD and digital copy, great remake of a classic"
2,"Unless you're frozen, get a canon...","This camera does a few things well... But only a few.The first, is that it does take decent candid videos. But even my phone can do that. I'm looking for better photos and this camera does not perform well. You have to have an incredibly still hand to take decent pictures with what seems like a VERY slow shudder. Inevitably, I get blurry photos. The reason I give it 2 stars is because of its form factor, and some of the features that can make it ""cool"". When I broke the LCD, I bought a canon and couldn't have been more happy that I busted this thing."
5,We are all in agreement here!,This book does the job of explaining WHAT our bodies need and WHY these Ten are the most important. Balch has helped us by picking the Ten Natural Remedies that are the most important ones. That way we can keep our focus a little better. Taking too many supplements throughout the day can get a little overwhelming. There are also combinations aimed at covering these areas of need. A site where my family has had great satisfaction in both service and product choices/quality is PapaNature. I feel the same way about praising them as I do about praising the work of the Balches. They also have additional documentation that exactly parallels Balch's topics in this great book.
4,Let me decide what to do with my money,"Despite criticism and apparent shortcomings, Walmart does provide a service that consumers appreciate. They allow shoppers to buy quality goods for less, and to keep the savings for other purchases or discretionary use. When consumers have more money in their pockets, they spread it around, usually benefitting other retailers or sectors, and often strengthening the savings and equity ratios of a community. Let's remember that America is a free and capitalistic society. If socialized and monotized policies and opportunity are what the critics of this film are seeking, let them move to a welfare state."
1,Don't waste your time on this propaganda,"First off, yes, I did watch this movie. It plays like a corporate press release. This film likes to cite how good Wal-Mart is for the economy, based on how much they pay in taxes. I would argue that the thousands of ""mom & pop"" businesses that have been displaced (destroyed is probably a more accurate word) around the country by a Wal-Mart opening in their town generated an equal amount (if not more, since they don't have an army of lobbyists in Washington looking out for their interests). I find it highly suspicious that this ""pro"" Wal-Mart documentary was slapped together in time to compete against the excellent ""Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Prices"" by Robert Greenwald. Watch that one instead of this piece of propaganda."
1,Terrible,"This is obviously a propaganda piece designed to counter Robert Greenwald's, 'Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price,' and nothing more. Wal-Mart is the largest corporation in the world, they are responsible for over 20% of China's gross-national-product for 2004 (as in sending YOUR money overseas to a country with countless human rights issues), they strip-mine profits from small-town America-putting many mom and pop stores out of business. Wal-Mart is ruining the United States, period. Don't let this fluff fool you."
1,I shop at Wal-Mart and I don't love it,"I hate the fact that I shop at Wal-Mart. But they offer the lowest prices and I need to save every penny I have living in this horrible economy where the rich get all the tax breaks and I'm left with nothing. Wal-Mart makes up for it's low prices by giving their employees a low pay check and having tax payers pay for their medical. My neighbor works and Wal-Mart. She does it because she has no place else to go. And she has a child she has to support so if she loses her job she will be in a very bad situation. Wal-Mart is a horrible horrible cancer on this world and one day it's going to kill us all.Oh, and Wal-Mart stores are total dumps. With the amount of money the company has you'd think they could pay a few extra people some money to clean the place up. But we all know why they don't, don't we? Because that would mean Wal-Mart paying for more employees when they know they can just force the ones they got into working overtime without pay."
5,The ultimate party album,"The phrase ""house rocking"" suffers from debased coinage. Any journeyman or journeywoman blues artist's record company will slap it on their live CD without giving a second thought to the standard of performance those words properly describe.But imagine for a moment the smoky blues club of your utopia. Nattily dressed men and big-legged women in short, short miniskirts... sweatily grooving to the hottest electric band you've ever heard. Rasping soul vocals. Stinging guitar leads.*That* is the kind of house-rocking Freddie King performed in The Electric Ballroom. The result was one of the very best live blues albums ever recorded.If the people at your next party won't dance to it, you need new friends."
5,This thing rocks!,"I totally LOVE my new stereo. Not only did it arrive at my house super fast, the owner's manual made it incredibly easy to set up the system. The sound output is great, I have no complaints. I haven't been able to figure out how to make the dimmer on the display work yet, doesn't seem to do anything when I follow the instructions in the manual. Still, even if that feature never works, I'd buy this baby again in a second. I seriously doubt I would've found such a great deal at a store, and in fact some friends bought the same unit for $150 more. I was hesitant buying a stereo system online, but the candid customer reviews made it less intimidating, and I'm grateful for that extra service that Amazon.com has here. Thanks so much you guys!"
1,470 pages of tedium,"I bought this because I was looking for some good, light fiction and I liked the cover of the paperback; it made me think of Hammer Films' THE LOST CONTINENT. SEA CHANGE started off reminding me of the movie THE FLESH EATERS; unfortunately, after a few introductionary deaths, you have to wade through over 400 pages of talk and speculation about ""the slick"". Amidst all the talk, there occasionally happens something that might be classified as ""action"", but don't expect the pace to pick up or the excitiemnt to mount; those moments are as dull as the endless conversations. All in all this is a reminder to pass any book whose singular cover endorsement is from Publishers Weekly."
1,Complete garbage,"I'm not going to waste much time ripping this book - just wanted to warn people away from it. The science in it is either stolen directly out of another book (The Hot Zone), or absolutely laughable. (Sarin is not a biological agent, Mr. Powlik) The characters are paper thin, the dialogue is awkward and pathetic... bah!"
2,disappointing,"Even though I enjoyed both of these books when they first came out, the conbination of the two was very disappointing. Also, the book was cheaply constructed. The pages felt like toilet tissue."
4,"Good book, bad book a compilation","Jurassic Park was an amazing book, and a must read, but The Lost World was a useless book written out of pure comercializm and it can be felt throught the book, much the same as the movie"
5,A beautiful story,"I just can't put this book down once I have started. When I read Yours 2 Keep, the story writeen by Ms martin was so good that I decided to read her other books and it was just as good or better. The attraction between Luke and Tess was so electrifying. I love Tess character and just wish that I was the heroine. Read it! You will love it too."
1,Still waiting,Still waiting for product. Can't decide or rate until the product arrives. Will update rating. Weather may have been a factor
1,cannot review what I did not receive,"I already had one of these in green and was hoping to get a matching one, even if a different color. I did not receive this planter. I received a substitute. When I went back to the website, it says they were out of the Mayan, so I assumed I could not get one. I kept the substitute, but I do not like it as well as the Mayan."
1,The Author needs counseling,"The arrogance of this writer makes you feel worse than before you opened the book. He implies that it is so easy to raise your self-esteem if you do what he says. He is the expert, you are the moron with low-esteem. Better books out there."
3,"OK, but Leonardo was a late blooming 'genius'--400 yrs late","Haven't read this book but keep in mind Leonardo's notes were only deciphered and published in the late 19th century--if he's a genius, and he probably was, though from an engineering point of view some of his stuff was conceptual and won't work, and was conceptualized before him--he's an undiscovered genius like American scientist Willard Josiah Gibbs, who made fundamental contributions that were not recognized at the time since he never published them correctly. What does that say about life--you have to promote yourself? But if you did that in the Renaissance that was sometimes dangerous; better to lie low."
5,It's a gem!,"On my ""buy it, get it from the library or skip it"" scale, this is a definite buy.If ""The Artist's Way"" were Creativity 101, this book would be Creativity 201. ""How to Think Like Leonardo DaVinci"" by Michael Gelb, is a masterpiece. It is challenging, expansive and fascinating.In it, he provides a step-by-step program for expanding your creativity and accessing your own creative flow.This book has not gotten the press attention it deserves. Get it anyway. It's a gem!"
4,Attn: Artists & Intellectuals. This is a good book.,"Do not mind the stars. The book is worth purchasing. 5 stars would mean that this is the last book you buy. I am a student on an endless quest for higher learning, excellence, creativity, intelligence, and so forth. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all students, teachers, and those in search of inspiration and hope of manifesting your hidden potential. My word of caution is to understand Leonardo da Vinci for who he was and what he pursued. If you too pursue truth, then follow the principles of Curiosita, Dimostrazione and so forth. Do not treat this text as a Bible. Understand the principles that helped Leonardo achieve his goal."
3,"Some good, some not so good","I bought this book for a spiritual book group. I found the information interesting, but a little preachy at times. I wish the author had included information on the chapters of the Quran. All in all, a good first understanding of this holy book."
4,Ska is back!!,"I thought that this band was now sell-out, but I was wrong. This new CD remind me of the first 2 releases from this band. It's a ska, hardcore, punk CD and the songs are goods at all. Not as good as the first album but it's close. I hope the energy is now there to stay in this band I restarted to listen!!"
4,especially good in summer,"Very easy to use when you follow their directions. Important to keep the butter evenly spread across the top. I live alone and it kept the butter at room temperature and fresh for over a week. Once you learn how much water to put in the base, it's a snap. Only complaint: the outside of the butter section gets a butter film on it and is slimy but, if you handle it by the top/base that sits on the table, you're fine."
5,Soft butter always on hand!,This is a wonderful product. We have biscuits or toast every morning for breakfast and it is so wonderful to have soft spreadable butter at our fingertips. We refill it the second it is empty (which is often at our house) and I wouldn't be without it.
5,Butter Keeper,Keeps my butter soft and ready to spread. Highly recommend this product to all who have trouble buttering their toast in the morning.
5,"Good product, great price","I've been wanting a butter keeper for quite a while, but all the ones I found were at least twice the price. It works great, but you have to be careful to get all the air bubbles out when you fill it."
2,Poor Quality.,"After few weeks of use I've noticed many hair-thin cracks in the glaze and some stains underneath the glaze. It looks like the butterfat is seeping into the cracks. The glaze is not thick enough.I think the butter keeper made of glass should eliminate that problem. I found one on amazon (Glass Gadgets 1096 The Only Glass Butter Keeper), but it's not available at the time of this review.The Norpro Butter Keeper holds 1 stick of butter, which is just the right amount for me. As soon as the butter is finished, the butter keeper is washed and filled up with the new stick. I think the reason why some reviewers have a problem with mold is because they keep the butter in the dish for too long."
3,Soft Butter,The butter keeper does exactly what it is supposed to do. It keeps the butter soft and fresh until you want to use it. It holds a stick of butter.
4,I like it.,"My Purchase.I am satisfied with this product, which I will be using simply I am changing from Magarine to Butter for my Health."
5,Cute And Useful,"This little butter keeper does just what it is supposed to do and it looks cute doing it. I didn't want a fancy butter bell, I wanted something that looks like classic crockery and this definitely fits the bill. The cost was right too, just love it!"
4,butter keeper keeps butter well,"This butter keeper does keep butter soft and ready to use. It helps if you change the water every 2 to 3 days because I believe it keeps the surrounding area cooler. I am not so sure it holds 1/2 cup soft butter, however, it is close to that amount. I am very pleased with this product. Pat."
3,Slippery,"I have problems spreading butter that has slipped out of the dish into the water. It slips around in the dish, perhaps a spike sticking up from the bottom might help. Three stars."
3,butter keeper,"It is a basic butter keeper, that functions as would be expected...it is a bit fragile and had I had the opportunity to investigate it's weight ahead of time I would have opted for a heavier grade crock."
1,Received a shattered Butter Keeper and Amazon won't replace it.,I was looking forward to my new Butter Keeper but alas I received a broken one. Admittingly I missed the 30 day return date and I think the return policy on here is fine except that if the merchandise is broken when received it should be replaced. I can't say that I'll never use Amazon again because I know that I will. I do however think that there should be a replacement policy in addition to the return policy.
1,Glaze cracks = Mold,"I love the idea of a butter bell, but I have abandoned the search for a good one.I have now tried several butter bells, all purchased on Amazon.com. I have tried both ""stoneware"" and ""porcelain"" models. I'm not sure what the differences between ""stoneware"", ""ceramic"" and ""porcelain"" are as to butter bells (or even if the manufacturers are applying the labels correctly). All have failed after a number of months.In reading reviews on Amazon, it seems that butter bells often have quite finite service lives. My experience was similar. Apparently, (i) the glaze on the ceramic often develops small cracks, and once it does, (ii) butter gets under the cracks, and (iii), once that happens, butter placed in the bell will quickly go moldy even if the bell has been washed in the dishwasher.Ironically, I don't have any problem if I just leave the butter out on the counter."
5,The perfect butter dish,"I used to eat margarine but now that there's none left here to buy that's good for the human body, I've gone to butter. I got frustrated because either it didn't spread because it's in the frige or if left out to be soft it went bad very fast. My friend had this butter dish went I went to visit her and raved over it and how it stays soft without going bad. She's right and I love it and recommend it to everyone."
4,"Recommended, with reservations","""City of Light"" is a wonderful, richly detailed evocation of a fascinating time and place; what it isn't is a great mystery. I'm a huge fan of the mystery genre, and would have preferred either more surprises, or revelations that were...well, surprising. That said, Belfer knows how to write, which is in itself a blessing these days. Worth the time, but don't expect plot twists and shocks."
4,A nice drink of water,"Until reading Belfer's book, I thought of Buffalo, NY as a place with a lot of snow and an above average pro football team. Now, it is a place instrumental to the beginnings of the modern world. Niagra is no longer a great waterfall, but a natural monument to where electricity was born.Using the minorities of the day to tell a powerful story (no pun intended, Belfer conveys how progress was made on the waterfront and in human backwaters. It is a nice blend of history, mystery, and thriller.I highly recommend it."
2,Trapped in Buffalo,"I've started this book several times, and put it back on the shelf.Finally I decided to stick with it, and I'm halfway through the novel.I don't understand why this rated rave reviews (they're all over the cover of the paperback edition). As a mystery, the story is not particularly compelling; I find myself not caring whodunnit or why.Some of the details concerning how electricity was considered controversial was interesting. I enjoyed reading about the PanAm exhibition. But I'm struggling to finish this overly long and belabored story."
3,"Simplistic in style, short on real substance","How anyone can compare Belfer's writing to Wharton or James I can't imagine. Her style is overly simplistic and the story is as shallow as melodrama. There's not an ounce of flair here. There is nothing the least bit remarkable in her authorship except for her obviously extensive research, which is really what this book is about -- it's like reading an easy-to-read history book for teenagers. Too unchallenging for this reader."
3,Enjoyable period fiction,"I enjoyed ""City of Light"". I found it to be a light romance, part mystery, part history story. It was kind of drawn out, but I had to read the whole thing once I got started. The ending was disappointing to me. I did find some parts unbelievable ( the Grover Cleveland story, the way the Macaulay board set up Louisa). I wouldn't recommend this as required reading, but it was enjoyable as a fun read."
2,not good,"This book is not good. It is just a listing of events and people in higher education, but in paragraph form instead of bullet lists. Instead of telling the story of higher education, it merely catalogs it.Other respectable histories of higher education is written by Lucas. (I would add Brubacher & Rudy, Rudolph's and Thelin's, but their focus is for the most part focused exclusively on the most selective and wealthy institutions). I recommend those over Cohen's."
1,"What a waste of time, money and effort!","This modem is one of the biggest pieces of garbage that I have ever seen. This modem requires MMX for it to work, but yet it is not mentioned anywhere on the box or in the manual. You want tech suport from the manufacture? Forget it. I could not even find this modem mentioned on their website. And if you want to talk to a live person, it's gonna cost you."
1,WARNING: Cannot be installed on non-MMX systems,"I was very excited at this find, but quickly became very disappointed. I was unable to install it with neither the enclosed software, nor a manual Windows install, because it did not detect a required MMX CPU. The price is right, but only if it's useable. The 1-800 Technical support line charges $7.00 / call incident -- as much as the modem costs itself."
3,no problems - so far,I didn't buy this modem through Amazon. I got it at a Yahoo auction for 9.99 including shipping. I installed it with no problems with the drivers cd. It seems to be working fine. I have not expieranced any of the problems described by others. I have had few modem installs go this smoothly.
5,Good Rules,"Cherie takes a very common sense approach to love and her concepts are easy to follow. And she starts out with the most important rule -- in order to love others, you must first love yourself. An AWESOME book I recently discovered is The Romantic's Guide. It has hundreds of fun tips on loving."
1,Unreliable.,"I subscribed to all three- Maisons Cote Est, Cote Ouest, and Cote Sud. There was an offer of a free tote bag with subscription, which I never received. The following year, I stupidly renewed, being offered a free tote bag (ahem) with renewal. Never received THAT, either. When I complained, I was told that offer was only for subscribers in FRANCE, which I accepted. Later, I realized the offer itself was in ENGLISH, so their explanation made no sense! I like the magazines alot, but I would never subscribe again because of this!"
3,"Ok, But Don't Be Fooled By Price","I got these wipes about 3 months ago and have been using them every day on my twin girls. I use a homemade wipe solution of baby wash, water and olive oil that I spritz on the wipes. They do shrink a lot after the first washing, but don't seem to shrink again after that. However, after every wash the edges of the wipes curl up, which also diminishes their size. I do what I can to flatten them out when folding, but I'm not about to take the time to iron them. Though they have some problems, they are soft wipes and don't bother either of my daughter's bottoms. They're ok, but not as cheap as they appear. The wipes are $9, but then you have to pay over $5 for shipping, which makes them almost $15 altogether. For close to that price you can get a nice organic cotton wipe if you use Amazon Prime and get free shipping. I don't think I'll use these again."
5,Great washable baby wipes,These washable/ reusable baby wipes are so soft. I prefer these wipes over any disposable ones. Great product.
3,a couple have unraveled after 3 prep washes,I haven't started using these wipes on my son yet (he should be born soon). I did however wash and dry these wipes three times to prep them for baby. I'm a bit disappointed that after the three washes 2 wipes are already starting to fray from the thread that is meant to reinforce the edges coming loose. This isn't a good reflection on the quality of these wipes. Hopefully they will hold up!
3,A little fuzzy,"These wipes are a nice size, but they leave little fuzzies behind. They are also pretty stiff if dried on the line."
4,Better wipes in lgth x wdth than lion heart,"Good item and only 1 wipe for explosion diapers clean up from a 3 month old breast fed. Only slight problem is that the end stitching will start to come undone after 3 months, but just a slight clip will do the trick....longer and wider than the lionheart cloth wipes and hold out well in warm moisture and fit well in the warmer wipe box from Lionheart."
4,Good product,"I have been using these wipes for about a month now. I usually spray water right on baby's bottom and wipe clean. They are an excellent thickness, so I'm able to use both sides, even with runny newborn poo. I purchased 4 packs, and 4 of the wipes have started to lose their serging, like others complained. They are still perfectly usable and all the others seem unaffected. I may update later if more start to fray so we know about how long they last."
2,Not great,"I wanted to love these wipes...they are SO soft! But we use wipes solution in a spray bottle and wet the wipes as we go, and when these wipes are sprayed, the liquid doesn't soak in readily and almost seems to bounce off the fabric. Also, after washing the wipes one time, before even using them, the stitching around the edges started unraveling. Am really disappointed. Returned these to Amazon. I have other flannel wipes from a WAHM from a certain website where you can buy handmade items, and they are far superior to these wipes."
2,Not soft at all,"I've used other flannel wipes, these ones are just not soft at all. They don't stay wet in the wipe warmer, and they're not very absorbant if you use them for a drying wipe. Go for terry instead. I learned my mistake."
2,I wish I could like these.,"I ordered these solely because of the price, and the flannel its made of. I have made many wipes of my own out of flannel. But with this baby I simply did not have time too. So I decided at this price I can't go wrong. But I do not like these. I do not know what grade flannel they made these from, but it can't be a high grade. They got rough and all pilled up in about 3 washings. I would rather have less wipes and high quality ones. Wipes is not something that makes cloth diapering pleasurable if they are cheap, low quality. I do not recommend these.I do however love the OsoCozy company. I love LOVE the betterfit prefold diapers."
5,The BEST book by Robert Crais,"I didn't discover Mr. Crais until recently ( 2008 or 2009). I read this book after Monkey's Raincoat. I have read all of his books and this is my favorite.His books are so good that I lose sleep because I want to know what happened and don't feel like waiting until the next day. Its rare that I find an author that I am willing to stay up and deny myself rest.All of the books about Elvis and Joe are fun reads but this has great nuance, its gives background on the characters which helps to understand their unique bond in the rest of the books. Most of us would love a friend/confidante/soul mate like Joe or Elvis. Its one of the reasons their stories are so compelling."
3,L. A. Requiem,Pike's character was more interesting than Elvis'. The characters relationships were unsatisfying. I would have liked a more definitive ending
5,the best one yet,"Crais takes your emotions all over the board in this one! Finally, we get a glimpse of where Joe Pike is coming from. Can't wait for the next book in the series!!!"
5,A STUNNING NOVEL!,"This book turned me inside out. I finished it, then immediately read it again. It is easily the most amazing novel that I've read in years."
3,For Crais' sake!,"Robert, I must tell you that page after page in italics is somewhat like mixing stripes with plaids, only much worse.Forget about Pike's childhood. A psychologist, you ain't.You embarrass yourself when you try to delve into the Mexican mystique. You are from LA, not L.A."
3,L.A.requiem,"Interesting,but not spellbinding.L.a. requiem is .not a book I will reread anytime in theNear future. Will try another book"
3,Reasonable performance,I bought this mainly to listen to Brian Lehrer's talk show which can be downloaded in mp3 format from wnyc.org.This little $20 device indeed does not produce room-filling sound but I could turn up the volume to that of an animated conversation without distortion noticeable to me.
3,It was John McLaughlin!,"I suspect Buckley borrowed more from McLaughlin than anyone else. ""McLaughlin Group"" is produced by ""Oliver Productions.""I thought the ego of Banion should have been explored more -- if he was as powerful as he thought, of course ""aliens"" would select him as their messenger.The ending fell a little flat for me -- the trial seemed a tacked-on artifice. Still, an enjoyable read -- and it would make a very funny movie (if put in the right hands.)"
3,"fun stuff, a quick read","I became a fan of Buckley last year when I read his very funny book, Thank You For Smoking. So naturally, when Little Green Men arrived in paperback, I snapped it up. Little Green Men is about a pompous political talk-show host who gets abducted by aliens--twice--and then goes on a crusade to have congress open up hearings on the existence of UFO's. Buckley consistently makes me chuckle out loud while reading his books. If it's not the situations and characters themselves or his skeweringly funny footnotes, the very names he gives his fringe characters crack me up. For instance, the protagonist's talk show rivals are named Tony Flemm and Brent Boreman. I loved the first half of Little Green Men, but it slowed considerably in the second half before picking up again at the climactic finish. This book is only 300 pages long and I consumed it like candy. Little Green Men is a fun read but it's not quite as good as Thank You For Smoking. (2000)"
4,Fascinating Premise,"A fascinating premise. Gets you wondering about the real world UFO and aliens- for which it reminds me of an equally fascinating book that's both informative, entertaining, and thought provoking: COSMIC TEST TUBE by Randall Fitzgerald. Cosmic is the real-world stuff of Little Green Men, and more."
5,I Loved This Book!,"This is a really good book. I have lots of trouble finding good books, and I found this both funny and entertaining. Sir Harry dressing up as his grandmother was hilarious and the end was even more entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked a good book and a sense of humor."
5,Great Book! Full of very insightful advice!,"I bought this book about 8 years ago when I met Talane in a course she taught in NYC. She is very top notch, and although I've given away many of my books, this one I keep to ""remind"" me, how to continue to upgrade my life...A page here and there to refresh my memory...You really can have what you want in life, and with the right tips and work, and adjustments, there can be magic at the other end. The way it is written, with simple but powerful one or so pager tips with explanation, it is digestible and can be applied right away...I was very impressed and although I have read every single book out there and taken every course, this is one of the best.Great book, thanks Talane!"
5,101 Principles for Life Design,"If you are wanting to improve aspects of your life, this book offers 101 life design principles that can help you tune up your life in areas in which you want to progress such as improving your physical environment, financial life, time management, relationships, work, communication, appearance and general success.Each principle is numbered with a couple of pages on how to apply it with examples. You can decide if it is an area you want to focus on improving. If you would like to hire a life coach but your budget is a consideration, this book is a great self-coaching tool. Its purpose is to help you reach your goals at work and in life. It is the kind of book you can re-read each year to see what principles you most want to apply for a life tune-up. The author gives talks on life design and is a personal life coach herself so is immersed in the material."
1,Picture is not representative,The photo is of a coupler with polished silver internals. The product I received was dull brass.
1,piece-o-junk,"Appears sturdy, and makes a nice click sound when cables are inserted. However the click is meaningless. The cable had to be stuck so far into the connector to make stereo contact it would not hold. I ended up with mono audio on my recording. If I ever use this again, I will wait for the clicks, then strongly tape the cables to the connector. I'm debating a return, but it's not amazon's fault and don't want them to incur the expense."
1,Faulty upon arrival,Did not work right out of the packaging and is not worth enough to send back for a refund. Which I suppose isn't so bad.
2,Poor Connection,"Even when the plug snaps in, it does not seem like it's fully connected in there. Therefore the sound only comes from either left or right, and distorted. But if you take the time to ""correct"" the positioning, a full connection can be achieved. But it's quite an annoying hassle. I use it with earphones so I plug/unplug it a lot."
5,fLABERgasted is an understatement,"I LOVE this new album...it rocx....i couldn't believe it.First i DL'ed one of the songs, and me and a friend of mind listened to it, and we were like, ""AHH!! This CD is awesome!"" and then i tried another song, and we were both floored! This CD...it blows all the others away. I mean seriously, it is so awesome! I love #3..how it starts with something more classical sounding, and then the transition to their style....i about wet myself : ) Anyways, i highly reccomend this CD to anyone that likes rock, especially the hard type.~God Bless~"
4,Very good......and not just for Christian fans,"No matter what your beliefs, this is a really good CD. An example of a band who keeps getting better, and the production is much improved on the CD which certainly adds to the bands strength. I'd also recomend new Fozzy with the WWE wrestler Chris Jericho, All THat Remains Reloaded as well for fans fo the genre"
2,Questionable,"I don't know how much I like this album. It's not the music that I don't like, but the questionable content of the cd. Some of the lyrics are downright depressing with few hints of light. Maybe this is just their style, I am not entirely familiar with all of Skillet's releases. It could be, on the other hand, that the prospects of money, via a new label, has geared them in a new direction. On their official website ""biography"" there is not even mention of their faith in Christ, although ""...driven by their faith in music..."" they have accomplished much. Also, the album cover combined with the title ""Collide"" is fairly disturbing. If anything, I'd say this album is suited for those who are seeking God out and have not already found the Truth, due to the fact that this is not a very uplifting album. Pillar's ""Fireproof"" is nearly as heavy as ""Collide"", but accompanied with powerful, well-conceived lyrics."
1,wha happen?,This album is missing the emotion of the three previous releases and I'm not sure whether the most annoying thing on the cd is the instrumentation or the vocals. The instrumentation on this release (and I would like to emphasis that it is only on this disc) sounds like something you would hear on CMT. It's overly produced sound reminds me of the worst kind of pop and country ever made. The vocals lack the soul and vulnerability heard on the previous releases as well. I would like to note that the lyrics are as clever as ever and are the only thing that keeps me waiting just as impatiently as before for the next album. I mean after you put out three amazing works of art it's ok to let one get away.
5,Really funny,I'm A Stranger Here Myself is a very funny book. I laughed out loud. Of course I always enjoy books written by authors from my home state Iowa.
4,Don't Dump On Me,"Though I liked the book overall, and I really did, I found that after a while it was a bit trying how much Bryson seems to put down the very country he has chosen to live in. From complaining about the amount of choices in the supermarket, to our over reliance on fossil fuels and cars, it gets a bit trying. What I really found ironic was that even though Bryson puts down Wal-Mart and big discount chains I bought is book at Costco! At a deep discount no-less!!"
3,Unfriendly Toward America,I am in the process of reading all of Mr Brysons books but I was taken back by the unfriendly way he discribed America in this book.
1,Not What I Expected,"Based on the title, I expected the book was going to be about how the country had changed since he'd been gone but it isn't. It's many diverse ramblings that have nothing to do with the title."
2,Desk Fever,"With far too much time on my hands I have elsewhere offered my comments on Bryson's other books and awarded five stars to each. This book is awful. It came out in the UK under the title 'Notes From A Big Country' and is effectively a series of journalistic pieces cobbled together to make a buck. One senses that Bryson has gotten lazy. As a writer, his talents are best served by subjecting himself to inconvenience and peril to entertain us all, (I, for example, was hoping that Bill would be attacked by a bear in A WALK IN THE WOODS and possibly eaten) but this business of sitting by a snug fire in Hanover, New Hampshire and writing about cupholders is a disappointment. Bryson's formula works best when he is the participant rather than a social observer. We have enough journalists making whimsical observations about minutae. We need to get Bill back to somewhere dangerous; Mt Everest would be good. Or somewhere with crocodiles."
3,"Misleading title, I should have read the reviews first.","The book is not bad, but it's not what I expected.I was expecting a book having a lot more to do with the culture differences between America and the UK. A book discussing the small differences in daily life, kind of what you get when you see a nice foreign movie. One of those where you relish the scenes of the character just going to the corner store.Instead it deals much more with a nostaltgia for what has changed for the writer in the last 20 years. It seems to languish in this nostalgia with only an occasional foray into the differences in modern daily life. (Like a visit to the post office and how these compare)I actually got this at a bookstore after only briefly reading the back cover and leafing a few pages. I would have to say that reading reviews here before buying does work better. I guess thats why I wrote this review."
5,extremely entertaining,"I bought this book while browing because (1) I had read and loved In a Sunburned Country, and (2) because I spent the first 18 years of my life as an American living overseas. I moved permanently back to the U.S. several months ago, and I was interested to see another American's perspectives on being here.The book was highly entertaining. Many of Bryson's observations made me laugh out loud. My parents also enjoyed the book. Despite the fact that Bryson's topics were a little more trite than what I had been expecting, I thoroughly enjoyed his hilarious style of writing. I would definitely recommend this book, and I plan on reading more of Bryson's books in the future."
3,A good listen,"I bought the audiotape as read by the author for a long road trip I was taking. It remains the best audiotape buy I ever made. At times, it was just a biased commentary on American politics and at other times uproariously, drive-off-the-road funny look at what America takes for granted as everyday nuttiness. The book or tape are best for those that have spent time abroad and find Americans quirky. It will not be good for insular Americans or people looking for the exotic."
2,Not one of his better works,"This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers. It's as if he published this because he needed money. There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up."
4,Me too.,"Having lived outside the USA for the last 38 years, I return as a tourist, who feels strangely at home. B. Bryson's observations are often my own. His send-up of American ""civilization"" rings true and is wonderfully refreshing. It makes me glad to be back so I can see for myself! Benjamin Franklin was right when he recommended the American national emblem be the turkey."
2,Terrific....Bathroom reading.,"I hope it is not a back handed compliment to say that this book belongs in the bathroom. But the consistently short length, the consistent formula and somewhat repetative nature of Mr. Bryson's musings are not the stuff of a long sit down. While his perspective as an American coming home after 20 years abroad is refreshing in his humor, I found the collection more dated and tedious than funny. There were several moments of out-loud laughter, but just as many times I though to myself, ""I've read this before...I know what he is saying...I recognize his writing style and formula.""So I recommend this as a sometimes book. Of the 70 short essays, many are insightful and wise-the one on why trees leaves change color comes to mind-and others fun. They are best experienced in passing glances."
3,Beautiful but rather impractical,"I ordered these to use as kitchen canisters for flour and sugar. These are lovely pieces--the colors are bright and cheerful and they do look nice in my kitchen. But, having said that, I would not purchase these if I had it to do over again. The ""Farina"" or Flour canister can only hold about half a sack of flour and the ""Zucchero"" or Sugar canister at most holds 3-4 cups of sugar (maybe a third of a sack of sugar). Also, the lids are NOT airtight (which one does see a lot with the hand painted pottery)and they tend to slip around a little bit. I will be surprised if my husband or kids don't manage to knock the lids off and break them before the month is out. If you are looking for decorative pieces only, I highly recommend these as they are beautiful. But, if you need flour and sugar canisters, my advice to you is to keep looking."
4,Moran of the Lady Letty,"I purchased this for ""Moran of the Lady Letty"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. According to the literature, Valentino's character was given a Latin name to fit his look. Yes, Valentino was Latin, his mother being French and his father, Italian. I just don't think his look was heavily Latin to the extent that it required a name change for his character. I think Ronald Colman and John Gilbert looked much more Latin when playing such roles in films. It's just my view on the matter. It was interesting to see George O'Brien and William Boyd in small supporting roles. I think Moran is one of the best of the seafaring silents I have seen, and I would highly recommend this set especially if you are not a Valentino fan but like high sea adventures."
1,Horrible,"These were horrible. Absolutely useless. As far as I could tell, there was no detectable difference in temperature after opening them and exposing them to the air. Shook them, made sure they were well exposed, nothing. At first I thought a few of them were defective, but after getting through a few more, I realized most of them were completely innert. I had one pack that took about 10 minutes to get hot, flashed to a hot temperature and 2 or 3 minutes later cooled back down to room temperature. Get a different brand, this brand is useless. Apparently they are ""eco-friendly"" though if that makes you feel any better, ""made with wind energy"" it says, whatever that means. Feels like they just scooped some sand and put them in a bunch of coffee filters. Get the Grabbers, or the Hot Hands. Wish I could get a refund for these still."
2,Cannon Printer Cartridge,"Performance is acceptable, but not as good as OEM. Manual exposure needed to get good results. Don't know yet how long it will last."
1,"Honestly, this is not good!","You know, after 10 years of no new music, when I heard of this disc being released, I was so eager and the release of the new Sevendust and Primus on the same day meant nothing. I rushed to Best Buy to get this and after listening to it all the way, I decided, that is the worst Living Colour release yet. I mean honestly, we are in a different time period now, but that is no excuse for this disc lacking in musical maturity, lyrical denial, or just straight up nonsense. Who covers Back and Black? Sorry, poor choice, the production is also very poor and this disc is not even in the same ball park at Staind or Time's Up. If you are an avid like I once was, then I suggest you buy this and form your own opinion, but it take it from me, if you are expecting a spectacular step from their past releases, you will be dissapointed."
2,Disappointing return,"I've waited nearly ten years for this cd, and I'm extremely disappointed. Not that the songs aren't good, they are. But the sound production is atrocious. Its like they purposely went for an early 80's garage band sound, which is fine if you're The White Stripes. But Living Colour should have a big, loud crystal clear sound, so that Vernon's notes sear through your head like a red hot blade. Speaking of Vernon, where are the guitar solos? Has he been hanging out with the members of Metallica, who convinced him that guitar solos are just ""so passe'?"" And the lyrics? Fuggetaboutit!! As trite, whiney and cliche' a list of leftwing whinings that I've ever purchased. I can dig the message, but do they have to beat us over the head with it every freakin song? Remember how clever songs like ""Love Rears Up Its Ugly Head"" dealt with an issue? Too bad Living Colour doesn't. Great band, lousy cd."
4,shame on you trendy amazon reviewers,This cd is up to par w/ anything they've done in the past. Lots of great songs on here. Anyone looking to checkout TRUE musicianship look no further. Stain was awesome and so is this.You wanna talk bad production (like the other reviewer) pick up the live @ cbgb's cd ... that's awful!Pick this release up with confidence if you are a LC fan.
1,Hey Ivy Queen find another career,"Whats really going on with this woman? She must think shes Kim, Foxy, Charli Baltimore, or Roxanne Shante. Those are real female MC's Ivy. Does she even look up to them whenever she drops an album? This LP is total garbage and not worth a dolla. Hey Ivy, you may want to look into another profession such as an adult film start because thats what you look like."
2,"Oh, how I lament the bygone days...","In I Thee Wed, the characters fall flat, crushed under a forced ""gothic"" aura and oppressed by the ""witty"" banter. It was clear from the first few chapters who the villain would be; the secondary characters, while trying to be amusing, were merely annoying.While not as laughably, depressingly god-awful as With This Ring, I Thee Wed does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as with Quick's past works, like Mistress, Rendezvous, Scandal, etc. It's a trend with Quick that she uses formulic characters (i.e., the dark, tortured hero, the virginal, sweetly valient heroine) but somehow, starting with Affair, the formula has become noticeably unbalanced. I don't hold much hope for Wicked Widow, and frankly, I am not sure I want to read any more Quick after my these last two cringe-worthy, money-wasting efforts."
2,Disappointing...,"I am a fan of Quick/Krentz and I love her historical romances. I had been already a bit disappointed with ""With this ring"" so I thought this one was hopefully going to be better. I was wrong, ""I Thee Wed"" is much worse. I don't know where is the romance here. It seems like A. Quick is much more interested in the plot she painfully sets up than in her characters. It's a pity since the quality and characteristic of her previous books lied in her ability to describe the relationaship between complex and strong-minded characters. I just wish A Quick took a break instead of producing so many novels and comes back in a year or two with a really good romance this time."
3,I THEE WED,MS QUICK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. THIS BOOK IS NOT QUITE UP TO HER USUAL STANDARD BUT IS STILL ENTERTAINING AND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS. HOPE SHE COMES THRU AGAIN WITH A FASTER PACED STORY.
4,"Funny, light reading from Amanda Quick!","This is actually the first book I read from Ms. Krentz. I loved it and went out and bought all her books. Even though this book is shorter in length and simpler in plots than her other books, it is still my favorite."
3,Slightly disappointing.,"I have read all of Amanda Quick's book and find this one doesn't quite meet the standards of the others. Not as much tension between Emma and Edison as main characters in other books. Also, Basil Ware was predictable. I was interested in finding out what happened to Miss Kent, but it was never mentioned in the book. Also, once Emma moved in with Victoria, the character of Letty was basically dropped with no explanation. The ending to me was a let down, not much suspense. I enjoyed the earlier books much better and still re-read them."
3,"Okay, but I've read better","This book is a good breeze-through for anyone who needs to understand some of the basics of money, but I admit I was disappointed in the budgeting section. I have been tracking my expenses for a year now and I was hoping that the budgeting section would provide a good alternative to that (since it is a bit of a burden), but there was actually very little information on how to set up the ""simple"" budget he is talking about. For those of you who need a better and more in-depth approach to budgeting and debt-reduction, I would highly recommend ""Debt-Proof Living"" by Mary Hunt (BTW she is also a Christian). It's a much better resource. For those of you who need basic information on investments, car loans, mortgages, etc, this is a good start and will provide the basics without overwhelming you, then you can get more information later as you need it. The bible references in here were a nice touch."
2,Guterson ran out of gas,"Half way through this book, I couldn't put it down, then all of a sudden it ends rather uneventfully. I would have recommended this book prior to finishing it."
4,A tone poem for the West...,"Any author that can find the opportunity to use the word ""limn"" has my undying respect. A hauntingly lyrical ode to the parents, alive or dead, of all of us over forty-five."
2,A great disappointment,"If you loved 'Snow Falling on Cedar's' (as I did), and buy this book as the next great novel by Guterson -- you are likely to be disappointed. For me, the great plot and vivid writing were missing. This was a bland and slow-moving story. If you must read it -- wait for the paperback. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."
1,A Bestseller????? Beyond me....,"I was only able to read the first few chapters of the book before closing it up. I just couldn't get into it. The authur seemed so amateur in his writing; unwitty dialogue, repetitive descriptions, unentertaining writing. You just can't really get into this, see what the author is trying to say, or feel for the main character, Ben, or any of the other characters he meets. This book has been a bestseller I've noticed. I could not believe it! It just doesn't have the talent, the excitement needed to be anything special. The author had a previous book a lot of us liked. To this book, major thumbs down; unrecommended; disappointing work from an up and coming gifted young writer."
4,Good Picture of Eastern Washington,"No, it is not Snow Falling on Cedars, but it is not supposed to be. Guterson's ability to create scene and atmosphere supports this good story of a man determined to call it quits on life once he finds he has a terminal disease. The novel actually embodies a quest for Ben Givens who finds reasons for life he had not before imagined. Rather than suspenseful, it is a thoughtful trip of discovery,"
3,Personal conversation,"I do not believe that I would have stayed with this book if it had not been the audio-book. The writing is simply beautiful; the story is purely sad. It contains all of the elements of life and is a bit too realistic on the ""dying"" aspects. I was relieved when the final tape came to an end. Listening to this story is not a complete loss for me. Thanks to Guterson for some wonderfully vivid pictures of scenery, and the feel of ""apple country."" But the horrors of the transient pickers and colon cancer I found very distressing. I feel more hopeful at the end than at the beginning."
4,So many feel they have so little to offer,"This book was my introduction to the author. It had contrived situations but the message regards how we encapsulate our lives and then regret the emptiness of our existence. This novel takes a suicidal individual out of his everyday life and thrusts him into situations where he faces life's complexities, it's frustrations and joys. In other words, he began to live again.I read his first book after reading this, and though it was good I prefer East of the Mountain."
3,Great Prose &#65533;.way too much sage!,"Like Snow Falling on Cider, this is such a beautifully written book, long lyrical descriptions of scenes and emotions. Much of the weakness of this story is in the slow meandering ""plot"" in comparison to the faster paced drama of Snow Falling.With so many excellent reviews of this book, I would just say, I enjoyed the prose a great deal, found it a bit slow at times, but overall a good read"
4,Vivid story,"I was attracted to this novel because it takes place in the state I live in, Washington. I was immediately pleased because the story was intriging, a retired surgeon finds out he has cancer and decides to set out on a hunting trip in which he plans to commit suicide, and the story of his life in the present and then his flashbacks to his younger days were well detailed, I felt I was really getting to know the character and I enjoyed rich history of Washington orchards brought out as well."
2,Slow and plodding introspective look at a dying man's mind,"I was disappointed in Guterson's book set in the part of Washington where I was raised. His plot was almost non-existent and even the descriptions of the beauty of the place didn't ring true. It was not a memorable book, but worth reading if you are Veteran who enjoys hunting and thinking about death."
2,Not up to Snow,"The Kirkus reviewer was wrong; many people have been disappointed by this novel, and I'm one of them.Snow Falling on Cedars had a lot to it--a love story, a mystery story, a war story, and a story of the shabby treatment of the Japanese during WWII. I'm usually not much interested in descriptions of scenery, but in SFOC, I found them enjoyable and integral to the plot. Here, the descriptions just sat there, doing nothing.Here is a man who is planning to kill himself but gets quite bent out of shape when he cuts his head in an auto accident (wasn't he wearing a seat belt?). I laughed out loud.He seems quite concerned about his injured dog but seems to have no feeling for the birds he wantonly shoots.The story went nowhere, and the few possibly interesting characters Ben meets along the way are not developed."
4,I COULD SMELL THE APPLES,This is a book for literature-lovers. I loved a lot of it. I agree that the first few chapters were draggy. The trip from Seattle to the first stop was too detailed. But the descriptions of the country around Wenatchee were priceless. And I emphathized with Ben Givens.
3,East of the Mountains,"A story of a retired surgeon named Ben Givens who decides to explore the wilderness with his dogs in a last ditch effort to find his life's purpose. His wife, who he constantly thinks about, died not too long ago. He now has terminal cancer and is struggling for a reason to live. In his travels, he encounters wild dogs and other unusual travelers. Although the story seems like it could be interesting, it was strange and I am not sure of the point."
4,"Good reading, very thought provoking and challenging.","Grant Jeffrey has produced another excellent work that follows his ""The Signature of God"" book. He presents intriguing information on the Bible codes that show to be still more vital evidence of the startling uniqueness and reliability of the ancient Scriptures. This book stands as an excellent introduction to understanding the true intrinsic value, endurance, and power of the Scriptures throughout history. I highly recommend it."
3,Thought provoking,"For the Glory of God ... Jeffrey Grant may not have gotten all of his facts straight but he does bring to light a very good point and that is ""Satin will use science to draw one away from God"". Page 251 on evolution is a perfect example of this."
1,whatever...stick to beat box,"Okay, the nice stuff first...this guy can definitely beat box. No question there. So why is it he trys to sing? No clue. Matisyahu is not a good singer. It'sd that simple. He wouldn't even make it through to Hollywood on American Idol. I mean, this guy is out of tune and way in front of the beat. So why doesn't he just make a beat box album? That would be great. He is actually talented at that. This album, though, is a good lesson in learning to do what you're good at, not what you'd like to be good at.I saw him live and the same thing. Everyone stands around tapping there feet until the beat box song and then they all go crazy. Hey, Matis! Take that as a sign."
2,Meh,His first album is great.. His live album is awesome.. This album is just too commercial and polished. That usually happens when an artist gets noticed and they try to prove something on the second album. Most of these songs just sound like noise to me.. Especially the remake of King Without A Crown..Fame and money will do that I guess
2,Not feelin it.,"The songs in this album are only decent, I'm reviewing a second time because I figured as time went on this cd would grow on me. Well, I still have Shake off the Dust on replay because Youth doesn't cut it. Sad that his best album is out of print. Of course Matisyahu isn't going to do true reggae again like his previous albums, main reason is nobody really wants to hear the same slow reggae. But in my opinion that's what Matis is best at; a unique style of reggae with the deep bass and jamaican accent. Trying to create another unique style that isn't reggae, resulted in Youth. Matisyahu is still an amazing artist and I'm curious to hear his next album to come."
2,Sadly dissapointed,"The only way I can describe this album is ""underwhelming."" I kept waiting for a good beat or a guitar solo to catch me... but they never came... not once. I remember hearing the single ""Youth"" on the radio for the first time and hoping that it wasn't the best track on the album, and unfortunately it was. His live album was excelent, and I still recomend that disc to anyone interested in his music, but he needs some more work in the studio."
1,This is one of the more dumb episodes of the tv series.,"Lucky stiff is an episode of Freddy's Nightmares taken from the second season of the series. It deals with a woman whose husband won the lotto-- but she only learns of it after his death. The ticket is missing and presumed to be in the jacket she buried him in. One of the duller eps of the show, Freddy is not a central character in the story, as he is in the other 4 videotapes that were released."
3,is freddy in this episode?,"This episode of freddys nightmares is ok, but freddy isnt the main topic of this episode. His role in this episode is only a cameo, The episode is ok, if your looking for episodes of freddys nightmares that are great, and where freddy is the main plot of the episodes, get no more mr nice guy, tricks and treats, dreams that kill, and its my party and you'll die if i want you to."
1,Lucky Stiff,"Of all the terrible episodes of this lousy TV series I've seen, this is the worst! There is no reason to see this cliched ""scheming wife killing her husband to run away with another lover only to discover that her husband was buried with a winning lottery ticket"" piece of garbage! Only for the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" completists. This video features Mary Crosby of ""Dallas"" and David Lander of ""Laverne and Shirley"" as the couple. It was directed (?) without passion, suspense or anything else film makers put into their work by William Malone. It co-stars Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. If you want an episode of Freddy's Nightmares check out any other one but this!"
2,Below his standards; too improbable,"This is a fairly generic tale: A few evil people within the government manage to accumulate enough information, lackeys and firepower to effect a coup d'etat. A handful of brave, unusually skillful, perceptive and extremely lucky individuals save the day, at great physical and psychological cost.Given that this sort of thriller depends on the reader being willing to give up any credulity, you'll like or dislike this book accordingly.I can get into an incredible thriller as much as the next guy or gal, but I like some novelty in my plotting, such as Balducci's earlier book, The Winner.The Camel Club is so dependent on truly extraordinary coincidences I can't recommend it. Nor do any of the characters become more than two-dimensional stereotypes, soon forgotten."
3,Startling Revelation for this Reader,"This book has everything.Arab terrorists, Washington, D.C. misfits, political skullduggery, former patriots turned traitors and a heaping helping of Washington alphabet soup. Scores of characters and subplots veer the story between venues and villains. Fold in the FBI, CIA, NSA, NIC and you have a recipe for a quick return to the library with an unread book.Yet, I persisted and discovered this book meanders towards a high-concept payoff. If the reader snoozes, he or she loses. When it finally appeared, it was a gem.Kidnappers sacrifice scores of no-name Arab and North Korean terrorists. They claim to want to harm no one and are reasonable people with a legitimate gripe. Yet they bring the U.S. to the verge of nuking Damascus.Is it possible I have grown too old for this literature genre?"
1,Camel Club - If you hate the USA you will love Camel Club,This was my first David Baldacci book and it will be my last. I have read hundreds of novels and never before read a more hate filled book towards the United States. This book makes Michael Moore and Ted Kennedy sound conservative. If you are one who believes that George Bush went to war in Iraq to boost the stock price of Halliburton this book is for you. If you think the USA is evil and we just need to understand the plight of terrorists you will love reading this trash. I want my money back!
3,The Start of Something Good!,"This is the first in the ""camel Club"" series. It is OK for developing the characters. I hope the follow-up books are better!"
3,The Camel Club,Book is very slow and has far to many characters. I'm on the 18th chapter and is just now getting interesting.
3,"Enjoyable, if slightly incredible","The characters were enjoyable and the adventure was paced well. The circumstances and solutions were somewhat beyond believable, but hey, it was worth the read."
1,"Awful, don't waste your money","I was surprised to see so many people claim Baldacci has ""leftist"" views. To me it sounded like a rehashing of right wing demagoguery but whatever.The story was just boring. And really, the author, like so many others, needs to stop relying on tv and film for his depictions of police procedurals. The straw that, if you will, broke the camel's back for me was when the nanny (who is ONLY wanted for tying up her employer and taking the kids) is shot and killed because she's driving directly at a roadblock with THREE FLAT TIRES and won't slow down.Give me a break. That's just one example of many. I am SO disappointed because I have read several of Baldacci's books in the past and really enjoyed them. This one is a stinker. Don't bother."
1,uninspiring formula book,"Being a fan of Baldacci, I looked forward to reading his latest. Unfortunately, if this is your first novel of his, please do not put him on the shelf. Baldacci seems to be writing under pressure or guidance here. His spirited expression seems muted, the characters unbelievable and not worthy of our sympathy. The plot is comic and there is a detectable, yet subtle hint of whitewashing patriotism over substance.I was bored with the book. The last few chapters pick-up, but by then, you just want it to end. The Muslim vs. Americanism subplot is a bit hackneyed already, so an extraordinary effort would have been needed to lift this subject to new heights (imho).Leave this one, but do not turn away. Baldacci is a good writer and hope his next one is back to business. Try ""The Winner"" or ""Total Control"" which are gems of the genre."
3,slow as a camel,"This is my first book by the author; I don't know how fast I will be to read another--maybe as fast as the plot in this book, which is as slow as a plodding camel. The book was not bad after it picked up, but getting there was a struggle. There are endless characters and subplots and trying to keep all of them straight through all the drawn out activity was tough. I also balked at the anti American political commentary. At first i was put off by the anti-heroes in the book but eventually came to like them, unrealistic as they are.However, once past the first couple hundred pages and I learned to suspend reality, the plot picks up and becomes enjoyable, making it worth the initial struggle. The many characters and subplots start to gel and the book becomes exciting. Exciting but not believable."
2,blame everthing on the society,"tried hard to finish it and still not really understand what the author stand point. He blames everything on American culture. I think he borrows the concept of Hollywood movies, blames everything on government, big corporate,..."
2,Baldacci can do better....I hope.,"I picked this book up to see why people recommended David Baldacci. After reading this book, I'm now even more curious why anyone reads his works. Hopefully, other books by this same author are better than this book which focuses on a group (The Camel Club) that figures out a conspiracy. Yes, the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies are all ignorant, but luckily we've got homeless people and ""former"" intelligence officers that solve big problems and reveal devious plots. One silly part is the use of tranquilizer darts instead of bullets when the terrorists attack the President. Yeah, right. Okay. Sure.The dialogue is sloppy, the various characters are either stereotypical or unbelievable and the book was about 100 pages too long. I struggled to finish the book and when I finished the book I regretted ever starting it in the first place.Skip this book. Maybe he's written better books, but I doubt I'll ever risk finding out."
1,Camel Club,"The book never arrived so I really can't review it. When I contacted the seller, they were really good about it and credited back my purchase. However, now I still do not have a copy of the book... bummer."
