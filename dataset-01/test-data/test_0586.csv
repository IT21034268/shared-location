5,Also works on the 2002 RSX base model!,This sensor is supposed to work on 02 - 04 Acura RSX Type-S. However in my case it also works fine on my 2002 Acura RSX Base (auto). (Denso's site says the base model should use 234-9006.) This sensor costs about 1/5 of the original part and works just fine.
5,Rsx Type-S o2 sensor Denso,"Amazon is an amazing site, I do not know what I would do without them. They saved me about $200 for the part itself and other sites wanted a ton more money than they did. The acura dealership wanted to charge me $350 for the o2 sensor, and 150 for labor. How ridiculous right? Especially because I found this thing for 93 freaking dollars, got it with free shipping and it arrived like 5 days after I ordered it in a nice little neat package. Replacing the thing was a breeze and it fit perfectly and was identical to the one I already had on there-obviously because the OEM one is a Denso. I am very pleased with the process of Amazon and the part that I got. Really freakin awesome. The check engine light went out in about 8 or 9 miles."
3,Warning Mac OS X users!,"Ok product otherwise, but hangs OS X Classic environment after a while, so beware!"
2,Instant Immersion Mandarin Chinese Review,"I find the format difficult to follow unless you know the lanuage. It is not good for a beginner, but someone who is more advance in the lanuage, say someone that had already studied it for a year."
1,it was rather pointless....,"This is the third book in the Petsitter Mysteries. I enjoyed the first one, the seccond one was ok and this one didn't do much for me. Infact, I found the book to be rather pointless. Yes, there was a mystery; however, there was not much investigating done by Kendra. Literally, all she did was set up meetings with other characters then ask them if they murdered Ezra. When they responded with a ""No"" she ""accused"" them of doing the deed.Also, I got a bit tired of the back-fourth feelings about Jeff. First, she isn't going to have anything to do with him..then she wants to keep him as a pet client..then she wants to use him for his PI skills..then she is back with him..then she doesn't answer his calls.....it gets a bit annoying after a while. I know alot of the series have off and on relationships but this one is a bit much for me.."
1,"DOES NOT INCLUDE ENGINE, WHICH IS DISCONTINUED","I am really disappointed. I just spent $[...] on shipping this item, to discover that it does not come with the engine needed to make the lights and sounds. No where does it say that a specific engine is needed to make the lights and sounds. Very disappointing."
4,Good white light,These are a white light but not the overly bright LED bulbs u see so many using now. Piaa quality was as always good.
5,Musical Tea Set,"I purchased this tea set for my three-year-old grandaughter and she just loves it. She enjoys ""pouring"" the tea and the cute sound it makes when pouring. She also likes pushing the lid handle on the teapot and hearing the song ""I'm a little teapot"".The product itself is made well--very sturdy and colorful. I'm sure I'll be served tea for a long time to come.I highly recommend this product."
4,A very good novelization of the popular role-playing game.,"This book is based in the world of the role playing game Paranoia. In the distant future a paranoid Computer rules life in Alpha Complex, blasting any traitors with extreme prejudice. Our hero James-B-OND-1 is an elite Internal Security agent who receives an impossible mission : to expose an untouchable High Programmer as a traitor. The book is darkly humourous, and is a good adventure story with a surprise ending. A wonderful introduction to the crazy world of Paranoia."
3,Not for Polycarbonate (plastic) lenses,"I had several (4 or 5) scratches to the front of my polycarbonate eyeglass lens. After 4 applications of 1 to 1-1/2 minutes each, I still have the scratches AND have swirls throughout the outside of the lens. I do NOT recommend the use of this product for removing scratches from polycarbonate eyeglass lenses."
3,etching cream,"Purchased product to remove scratches from my glasses. (Had read on eHow that this was effective) It didn't make the situation was, but didn't do what I hoped. Probably works fine for intended use."
5,easy to use,I used this to etch some glasses for a craft project. It is extremely easy to use. I used the brand's sticky reusable templates as well.
1,Bad buy option to repair your glasses,I used this Armour Etch. It actually destroyed my expensive lenses from Lenscrafters. They cost me $350.00 . I followed the instructions and it also doesn't advise you to wear thick gloves. Your finger's skin will pill off. I used in other glasses too. They seemed to had reduced some of the scratches but its just a bad buy. It took so long to see clear. Cloudy glasses for a while. I bought a cleaner from Meijers store that they sell and that helped to repair them. Its kind of creamy tan lotion. Do not wasted your time. Save money and buy yourself a new glasses. Never used this product for optical glasses that are plastic type. I bet it would destroy just expensive sunglasses.
4,Lowepro Roller,"Lowepro Pro Roller 1 Rolling Camera BagBasically, I love it...it's very sturdy (I've had others that I didn't trust), very rugged & well built. The system for holding the tripod seems a bit flimsy & I don't use all the time...it can also get in the way with a tripod on it. The lid could be just a little roomier...sometimes its a very tight fit & I never put anything in the lid. It seems they could have put quite a few more pockets on the top outside with more room for things like chargers, batteries, cables etc. But overall, the padding inside is great..very sturdy holds up under rugged treatment. Love it."
4,"super-cute ""Wizard of Oz"" Dorothy doll","First of all, the 2007 'Pink Label' ""Wizard of Oz"" collector dolls are starting to become quite scarce in certain areas; the Dorothy model is one of the nicest ""Oz"" themed dolls I've seen in a long time.Using the regular 'open-mouth' Barbie head mold, Dorothy wears her long curly brunette hair in two braids secured by blue ribbons. Her blue gingham frock has a shimmery effect which evokes the bold Technicolor look from the movie. She wears blue socks with shiny red ""Ruby Slipper"" pumps. On her left arm, Dorothy carries a basket containing canine sidekick Toto.The doll is nicely presented in it's windowbox, but if you prefer to have her displayed ""de-boxed"", the package also includes a dollstand. Truly a lovely piece for the OZ fan in your family."
3,Not much new,"It would probablky help if I likes Ms.Kahn's work to begin with.But if you have any surface design books or are playing around with fabricpaints, most of these techniques would be familiar to you. And I felt if Iread the words ""as desired"" one more time,I would throw the book out the window."
5,Good soundtrack,"i listen to about ten to fifteen bands each day trying to sort out the rubbish. sadly the good bands that are left are few compared to the junk that is around them. but this band is great. they have good ideas, interesting melodies and lyrics. brilliant rhythms. best of all they use any instrument in a way that it is not normally used..... piano like thurston moore guitars, or guitar like john cage piano....listen all by them and hear the way that they have progressed from the last EP's and short recordings to this, a slightly longer 'soundtrack'. this is great stuff, but the release after this is better....'young bodies heal quickly, you know'. Both show of their talent, sadly not many people stock the two EP releases previous to Ctrl alt del u.Best sound match is like a fugazi/sonic youth as played in ajohn cage technique.has anybody else noticed the un-credited copy of the buzz online review of the album from' seattle music fan'?"
5,Vey cool!,"Awesome canoe! My girlfriend and I have taken this thing everywhere! Just a tip, buy the pump to blow this up!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its real cool make sure it has a lighter adapter for the car you can pop the canoe in your trunk and blow it up in about 5 min ready ta go."
3,Not what I thought.,Bought this online thinking it would be slim and sleek...its still a big backpack..and expensive. I have a 100-400mm lens and there is no compartment inside for it. It has 3 compartments for lenses that fit maybe a 200mm. Anyway i bought the backpack to shoot sports and not look so conspicuous....it has the opposite effect.
2,Amazons Unbox service is BAD,"The episode is great, like any Yo Gabba Gabba episode.Amazons unbox is not good. Bad video quality, and about a gig of space for your poor quality. We have a few episodes purchased this way, so maybe I don;t hate it that much, but I was shocked by how bad it looked. My daughter (just turned 2) is probably used to the nice HD versions that we get from Netflix, which makes it very hard to watch the amazon unbox version.This is not enough to turn me against amazon, they can be bad at this, I still love everything else they do."
2,Standard Deviants Chemistry,"I did not find this video helpful at all. I purchased the video after reading other comments. Too basic. I did not find any explanations to help in the understanding of what I already knew. The rapidity of the video makes it difficult to focus even though other reviews thought this was a good point. The ""drama"" of the characters takes away any effectiveness of the learning. My copy did not come with the insert they refer to in the video either, even though this was sold as a new product."
1,outragous shipping charges,This specific shipper charges $6 per item. I wanted 4 of the same item and shipping would have been $24. The UPS actual shipping charge is less than 1/3 of that!
1,who cares?,I have to laugh at the bantering about whether or not what she said is accurate or what he said is true or if he used their names or had permission because really who cares? Listen to David Helfgott's music and understand that what he offers us is a glimpse of God.
5,the toy girls will love,My daughter really loves this toy alot. this really makes a girl get busy and helps them learn there decorating skills. I would buy this for my nieces any day. This really deserves a 5 star
3,Colorful and cute...but too tiny for real play!,"I ordered this dollhouse for my daughter's third birthday. We do a lot of traveling and I thought it would be nice to take on car trips. As a single mom, I sometimes take my daughter with me to places where there are no other kids and thought she might enjoy playing with it alone.The product itself is pretty,cute, and durable, and has nice pieces. Unfortunately, I've noticed that it frustrates my daughter fairly quickly. The dolls don't fit easily into the chairs, couch, or bed, and fall off repeatedly, especially if she tries to put the people on the chairs and sit them at the dining table. She needs my help to play with it and even I find it difficult to maneuver the dolls around in the tiny spaces.I had planned to buy her the country house and then the other pieces as they were available. I really think it's a great concept and a cute toy, but it hasn't held her interest as I'd hoped it would."
4,Refreshing Drink,I can't say Im really sure if this really work or not but I like to have it while I exercise. I think it help me go through my exercises and refresh because it has a sweet taste and feel get some energy back. I would say the taste isn't that great but it is ok and don't bother me at all. I use it while exercising most of the time not before or after.
4,"Good summary, lots of photos","After visiting Anchorage, Seward, and the earthquake museum at Valdez, I wanted to know more about this famous Alaskan event. This book does the job quite well. It does get a bit technical but those portions can be overlooked. It has lots of photos that are nice because you can see places you've been and how they were damaged. Easy read, but informative."
1,Nikolai Safavian - Very Strange,"This music is very unusal. Never heard this style in Armenia ver much, not even grandmother. Some times in TV shows."
2,Flimsy!,"Card readers shouldn't cost an arm and a leg, and I'm not one who believes you always get what you pay for, or that inexpensive is bad. But wow is this thing cheap! I'll admit, all I've tried it with so far is a compact flash card. The CF slot is shallow and the second time I inserted the card (not forcing it in anyway, mind you) it bent the contacts so as to render that slot unusable. From what I can tell, neither card or data were damaged but maybe I was lucky.In Vista, my computer searches for a new driver every time I plug this reader into the USB port. I've had no such issues with the other card readers I've used over the years. Not recommended. (Two stars because I'll assume that it works a bit better with newer memory card standards, such as SD where the contacts are less delicate)."
1,Practically worthless,"This book is so biased in favor of Gates, a man of very debatable reputation and capabilities, that it is virtually worthless. Patterson becomes a contortionist in his transparent attempts to rehabilitate Gates, missing many of the key details with sloppy mistakes and poor analysis. The only reason I gave this one star is because I could not give it zero stars."
1,An honest review.,We were very disappointed.It looks to be a repeating image of a gas fireplace although they did add crackle sounds for affect.If we could return it we would
3,"Good descriptions, not very enlightening","The title of this book led me to think it would be about religion and consumption, and would have some connection to the growing literature on food and society, food history, and the origins of American food traditions. Instead the book is very narrow - it deals mainly with the tradition of Protestant potluck suppers, and reaches the not-very-surprising conclusion that they were important in building social networks and holding congregations together. And that's pretty much it. You have to provide the analysis and wider context yourself."
1,Not for beginners,"I had so much trouble with this camera. First it wouldn't work with my side USB port, everytime I plugged it up it locked up my computer. So I called tech support and they told me I had to plug it up in the back, and they showed me how to cut and paste the pictures, but didn't show me how to get the pictures through the software. so I couldn't get the camera to work with the software, it kept telling me the camera wasn't hooked up when it was. The thing that really got me though was that you have to turn the camera off to view the pictures you just took. So everytime you want to see a picture you have to turn the camera off and, turn on the LCD. And then if the picture wasn't good you have to turn the camera back on, turn the LCD back on, and then reset your preferences, it's really annoying. The only good thing about the camera is the long lasting battery that's included. I ended up returning the camera and paying $50 more for the Sony DSC-P30."
3,Very battery intensive?,"This was my first digital camera. I found it very easy to use with the quick start intructions. The pictures came out nice and they downloaded easily into my pc. I took 8 pictures, downloaded them, and spent some time learning the menu options. I figure about 60 to 90 minutes. I turned the camera off. The next day I went to take pictures and the battery was dead. It was late, so I used some Duracell AA batteries, which the instructions said you could use. It took 8 new batteries to take one picture and download it. Forget about making any changes to the settings. I had to put batteries in and take picture right away."
4,4.5 stars,"Watson weaves a tale about family, loyalty, and justice... and how a twelve year old boy remembers the summer of 1948. _Montana 1948_ was very well-written, and I found myself immersed in the story. Watson's setting, post-war Montana, matched well with his style and tone. The setting was quiet and casual, and while there were some very sad and tragic themes discussed, the style remained calm and quiet.Overall a good piece of short fiction."
3,"Crisp, straight-shooting prose/so-so story","This could have been much more compelling as a short story or novella under 100 pages. I think the second half is especially drawn out unnecessarily. There's too much minute-by-minute descriptive detail of trivial actions (e.g. making coffee, walking in and out of the house, walking up and down stairs) and emotional reactions of the characters. This story also has a higher ""telling"" to ""showing"" ratio than I would prefer, but good descriptions that gave me vivid and memorable mental images of the settings and characters.I know there is a deeper meaning that we're supposed to get from this story concerning the mistreatment of Native Americans--and I think that's great--but the story itself could have used an extra shot of surprise or originality."
2,Montana 1948,"I enjoyed reading this novel it was very intresting. Except for the parts when the doctor would do unkind things to Indian girls. Reading this book was a positive experience for me because if it weren't for my teacher I would have never picked this book up.One of my favorite scene in this novel was when the sheriff through the doctor his brother in to the basement instead of the town prison the doctor commits suicide and the sheriffs family packed up and left town. One other scene I liked was when the little boy David seen his uncle comes out of the house, and the next day Marie died.The author was able to hold my interest thought out the entire novel. He did this by adding weird scenes thought out the whole book. Especially the parts when the doctor would do weird things to the Indian girls.I learned that that when you do the right thing there is always a price to pay. You will never live happily ever after. I would not recommend this book to my friends because I don't have friends."
4,Montana 1948,"Montana 1948 was a very exciting book. Reading about all of his horrible incidents that happened during his summer, makes me realize that my life if a lot easier compared to many people. The book's suspense always kept me reading, and I didn't want to ever put the book down."
4,Sherena unique,i came across one of Sherenas songs sleeping beauty a few weeks ago.......and now these.....she has such an amazing haunting unique voice.....i listen to it over and over again..........has she got an album???????????????????????
5,daughter loves them!,"I started my daughter on a sippy cup of water at 6 months because she was always reaching for my glass of water. Other sippy cups were too hard to suck out of. When I took out valves, they just leaked. My daughter loves these cups. They are cheap, don't leak, and wash up in the dishwasher. She is now 11 months and still uses them. A must have for all new moms!"
5,The Never-Go-to-Sleep-Without-It Storybook,"Our 2-year-old granddaughter loves this book and has it read to her each night the last thing before the light goes out. She never grows tired of hearing it, and she relates to all of the little fox's behaviors and emotions. Her parents were divorced when she was 20 months and right after that our son, who has custody, began reading her the book every night. I believe it has helped her transition to a single-parent-with-grandparents-and-uncle household. She talks about all of the pictures, loves identifying specific objects, and has a very ""Awww"" reaction to some of the charming illustrations. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make a child feel special."
5,Can't get enough of that funky stuff !,"When I first listened to this live tapes a couple of years ago, it just blew me away, the only thing I would like to know, why don't they bring out some more of this DJ mastermind (and please...let it be the 70's)"
3,"Some good points, too repetitive","Overall, this is a decent book that makes some great points. The book, however, is extremely repetitive and can become tedious at times as the author cites the same examples and ideas over and over (how many Tivo owners skip the commercials?).To put it another way, this book would be perfect if it were about 100 pages shorter. Another book that covers much of the same material without the repetition is Brand Hijack. I recommend reading that one instead."
1,Poorly made useless set of junk,"The finishing of these tools are literally crap. I wasn't expecting much for 10 bucks, but these are, un-usably pieces of crap."
3,No Instructions,I found this product hard to use. It had no instructions on how to use the tools in the kit.
3,Watch Battery Kit,"Product quality is not very good, it works, but does not seem very rugged.Could have used a very small screw driverwhich was not included."
1,Flimsy junk,"I ordered this thinking I could open my watch with at least one of these tools, but some bent and others just were not shaped right. I would not have bought this set if I had seen it in person. I had to take the watch to a jeweler for him to open it."
1,they don't make under the counter toasters anymore,"I tried to replace my old BD toaster oven and found one on line that seemed to match the under-the-counter hood that holds it in place and is still for sale. Alas, they don't make the toaster that fits that..safety concerns...the previous toaster was great, but I returned this one as I needed a space-saver and I bought a cheapie toaster only that uses up less valuable counter space!"
5,stop reviewing if you have no life,"i was very upset when i went through reviews and seen a bad review of this set by someone who doesnt like the music and has no life.This is the same reviewer that loves tiny toons on vhs and also has tons of bad reviews on kid bop cds and gives 5 stars on teenage mutant ninja turtles.I think its pretty sad when u insult at least 50 rap stars and give one star when u dont like the music they do,dont review it then.... i feel better mr. eggplant.shut up.ok unless you REALLY like hard brutal music dont buy this.If u do why are u still on the computer GET IT NOW!!Some stuff like the dvd is not good quality home movie style but the track solection,cover art comic book,booklet,and guess what mine came with a cannibal coprse guitar pick,hey its not perfect but im glad i have it thats why after 15 years they still rule the death metal world, i write reviews cause i like things not to diss them,hey eggplant enjoy all ur sonic games u loser."
1,This isn't music,"Cannibal Corpse: all of their crap all in one filthy package. I'd rather shove spoons in my ears than listen to any of this garbage again. Don't give them encouragment to make more by buying this album. I already burned mine in a bizzare satanic ritual because I hated it so much. It is nothing but a bunch of blasting, no-talent guitar, drums that go so fast they're almost out of time (in fact, they occaisonally are) and some guy who screams throughout the whole album and sounds like the cookie monster. Except the cookie monster doesn't talk about raping dead bodies like these twisted retards do. That's not all they talk about either. They also talk about ripping a woman's entrails thorugh her...nevemind. The point is, don't get this trashy peice of...well...trash. And shame on you for ever even looking upon it. I can't beleive that so many people see fit to give it 5 stars, when it doesn't even deserve the one star I'm giving it. Good day, you bunch of epileptic monkeys."
4,Maybe it deserves a 5/5...Not sure,"Very good read, proved to me that K'wan is definitely talented...I wanted to give it a 5/5 but based on the other books I've read, it's hard to give it a 5/5...But it is a must read, and a book you must have in your collection...Also it was the first K'wan book I've ever read, and it was so good that I had to buy Eve and Gutter, and those won't be the last..."
1,DO NOT LET MICROSOFT SUCKER YOU WITH THIS........,Just purchased two of these little turds thinking that I could use them to backup save game data to. I found out that there are some game titles that WILL NOT allow you to copy save game data - only move it. And NO WHERE is there any MS disclaimer or warning about this underhanded BS limitation. My advice to anyone seeking to purchase one of these with the intention to backup your save games is quite simply - Don't. Wait until enough **** has hit the fan and MS is forced to address this problem.
1,Way over price product by Microsoft for such little memory,"This product is way over price by Microsoft and I can't even copy my map packs to my other console in the other room. Microsoft monopolized the MU and now won't allow 3rd party MU to work on the console from October 28, 2009 update. This product can only help me to transfer small files at a times, I prefer my old MU that was 4GB for the same price but now I'm using this cheap Microsoft MU product.What's next Microsoft is going to say we can only use their HDMI cables that they provide and I can no longer use my Monster HDMI cable. I guess if you really need to transfer your files, plan on using it only for gamer profile, avatar items, a couple of saved games and that's it.Microsoft - if you want to regulate 3rd party MU, then at least make a bigger memory unit like MAX Memory and offer it at the same price they do."
4,fun and addictive -- another excellent Sid Meier game,"This game does have some faults -- the gameplay is shamelessly repetitive at points. But it just doesn't matter, because the world the game creates is so much fun to play around in, and the freedom to move among the various activities available (ship battles, sword fights, land battles, dancing minigame) is complete. It definitely has that ""just five more minutes"" quality that Sid Meier seems to achieve so regularly.The Xbox port is great and controls very nicely. Works well on the Xbox 360 as well. Just make sure to update the game through the in-game interface (not just through Xbox 360) as you'll get extra content that way and be able to upload your scores to Xbox Live."

3,jimmy on his own,"I like or shall we say love everything jimmy griffin writes and sings,,as i have recorded his material before too..he is a great songwriter and singer and i have known him for years ..with my song ""The Dream"" on Yellow Brick Rose"" records coming out ..I would like more of only Griffin by himself..hear me Griffin too anne bartee furgurl@lycos.com www.anne bartee s5.com"
1,"Good Hook, No Clips or bolts","This is a very nice hook, good and sturdy. However, it does not come with a way to connect to your pole. You are advised by the seller (after you purchase it) that you need to buy brass wing nuts, which are sold separately. I prefer to know this information up front when making a purchase, or better yet, like the product to come with everything you need to make it work."
1,"weak, not a good title","This book is basically an introduction to command-line Unix with a Linux CD on the back cover. The command line is crucial, but if you're gonna try to get people started with Linux you need to get X windows up in Chapter 2, not an Appendix!"
1,Why was this made?,"How in the hell did anyone agree to act in this? Where do I begin? Bad/stilted acting, grotesque editing (I think the editing team was all on a bender), laughable, bathtub-style special effects (all one of them) and makeup on a villain that was a direct ripoff of Star Wars. The ""bad guys"" seemed to do the bunny hop every time they were ordered to give chase to the good guys. I won't even touch the black/white rape scene because it's just beneath contempt.The sequences jump all over the place as though the editors were told that no act could last longer than 5 minutes. Were they on timers?Blech! just doesn't do justice to this vomitous mess.What's even more shocking is that I discovered the ""lead"" actor actually has a fan club! What, they couldn't find a lump of clay?Not recommended for pregnant women, old folks, or young children under 99. See at your own peril (and with a large bottle of Pepto handy).Oh, and I gave this a star because the system wouldn't accept 0 stars."
2,Tiny & Costly,"Got these for my 5 y.o. daughter last Christmas along with the tree house nursery and the whole thing went over like a lead balloon. Perhaps an older child would enjoy it more. For my daughter, I think the bits and pieces were just too small. She had trouble manipulating the toy and the puppies and as a result never really became interested in the set. And of course, this stuff ain't cheap. So... there ya go. I wouldn't recommend it for a kid under 7 or 8."
1,Worse Software for beginners,"I bought this to learn Russian, as it says it's easy, inexpensive and a fast way to learn. Don't be fooled! It mostly teaches you words not sentances or conversations, believe me it is the worse. The first CD teaches you colors, numbers, time, the alphabet and so on but it doesn't help with actually communicating with the people.Though I agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words.And Three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words, but to learn the actually language I find that it is impossible to.This is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it's basic words.Again don't be fooled, spend the extra ten bucks and get the Rosetta Stone Russian Explorer, it has more programs and conversational teachings. I recommend that better than this product."
5,One of the Best Trance Songs Ever!,"Someone by Ascension has to be one the best trance songs ever. I first heard this off the Tranceport CD and was blown away. The Thrillseeker's Remix is good, but nothing can match the epic beauty of the original Slacker mix."
4,A Must Have Book on Agricultural Machinery & Mechanization,"C. H. Wendel's Encyclopedia of American Farm Implements & Antiques is a first-rate work. The illustrations are exceptional, and the scope impressive. Wendel documents the machinery of manufacturing giants and the lesser-known manufacturers from the middle nineteenth century to the middle twentieth century. If you need to identify a machine or manufacturer Wendel's book ought to be your first source."
2,could hurt yourself...,Didn't really care for this DVD. My husband and I did it a few times and if you're not careful you could hurt yourself. We are seasoned walkers and had never tried kick-boxing. We will stick to walking!!!Try some of Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's if you want a good workout without getting hurt!
4,Great Product,"These are a great product, I liked the fact that it had different varieties in the box. When I run out I will definitely be ordering more of these, while I continue to breastfeed my daughter."
1,buy a different brand,"I strongly recommend buying a different brand. I personally like Johnson and Johnson's. The Gerber pads are thin, but crinkle and show in bras and leak. I use the heavy flow, because the lighter ones don't hold anything for me. What worries me most, is that I have noticed some of the little gels that are inside the pad used to absorb the milk on my baby's face during or after nursing. That can't be good. I'm just hoping she hasn't swallowed them. I was searching online to see if anyonen else has experienced this. Won't be using these again."
1,Not what I thought!,"I bought these pads thinking that it would work out fine. The pads that the hospital gave me worked out better! These are not absorbant and your bra will get wet, especially at night. That was my personal experience with the product, on to something different."
3,No big deal coming from Tiesto......,"I thought it was an OK CD, I think Tiesto has done better. His new CD Nyana is awesome. Really good trance and female vocals on that CD. Check it out."
4,Not the Best of the Magik Series,"If buying your first Magik CD don't start with this. As usual the mixing is flawless and considering he still does it with turntables it makes it even more amazing and outstanding and, and, and................. but there are better CDs in the series.Great tracks and love Stringer by Riva, great to hear it before Danni Minogue was involved and it morphed into Who Do You Love. Only downside, I am getting really really sick of Flight 643 cropping up on his albums. My all time fave by this guy and it will take a lot to top it but I really would like to hear something new."
2,"Nice Pad, Questionable Adhesive","I found I was allergic to the adhesive. For those who still think they might try these, even with delicate skin, you might consider a skin barrier or protection such as Smith & Nephew skin-prep Protective Dressing Wipes. I'm not promising this will work, but it's worth a try."
1,Poor description,"Not being familiar with the product I did not realise that this was a console driven electronic media. As the title said Phonics Book, I thought it was a book, how stupid. Therfore this item was completely useless to the recipient."
2,Not so great...,this just sounds like a hard rock metal band that never gained popularity. I can't hear much ethnic injections. The sound quality is not so great either. I'm not sure what the fellow liked in the prior review that really Wow'ed him but.... I'm not feeling it at all. I'll probably throw this disc in the trash.
5,Perfect Fit/ EL Is ff/Great Price,Perfect Fit and length for my 2001 Honda Accord ULEV Engine. Got it at a Great Price and delivered on time. My Engine Light came off within 24 hours and I was able to reset my maintenance light too.Thank you AmazonDenso 234-9014 Oxygen Sensor (Air and Fuel Ratio Sensor)
5,My favorite of his hits!,"Out of all the greatest hits collections I truly think this collection is my favorite. These are some of his best songs. You have so many nice songs its amazing like Ace in the hole,Babys gotten good at goodbye,Baby Blue,Drinking Champagne and so many more just 10 great songs. This is great but I do say that any fan of this cd really should buy the real albums these songs came off of because I think those are his best albums. Your hearing his hits here from 1988-1991. Great collection if you are little strapped for cash right now and cannot afford the box set."
3,Who's on first?,"I enjoyed some of the history in this book, but I had trouble following the events. The author jumps back and forth with different draft regulations, statements and lawsuits in no particular order... and I was left scratching my head wondering what the final outcome was.I'm not new to organic agriculture. But I picked up this book to learn the history of the movement. It left me with more questions than answers, but maybe that's ok."
2,"Nut close to spring, hard to insert","I used these on the front end struts for my 96 Firebird. First, the hooks are so tall that I had to jam them in between the coils, severely scraping the newly painted springs. Second, there isn't much distance between the nut and the spring. I had to alternate back and forth very frequently to prevent the spring from leaning into the socket being used to tighten the compressor, which would then prevent the socket from being able to be removed. In the end I probably used these about 10 times and got better at it over time, so they do work comparatively well for the price.Edit:Downgraded my review from 3 to 2 stars. Lent these out to a friend and one of the shafts bent. To be fair, I am a bit surprised because I was using these with no problem on my Firebird struts. The person who bent them was working on a truck spring, which may have been too much for these."
2,Just another family drama,"I don't have much, if anything to say about this book. My attention wandered while reading it and I all but skimmed about the last 100 pages. This book REMINDED me of something Joy Fielding would write, but that's about it. Joy Fielding is a much better writer and she writes a much better family drama than this woman could ever hope to write!I kept with this book thinking something was bound to happen and it never did. For me, the book would have been better had the author spent more time on the relationship between Lana and her husband, Jack instead of having jack die right away. (I.m not giving anything away here since jack's death is alluded to on the back cover synopsis of the book and he dies in the first chapter. So, pretty much if you read the back of the book, you've read the whole book, but if you still must read it, pick it up at the library!!"
2,The Life With God Bible,The Life With God Bible. The print in this Bible was too small for me to read. I am returning it to Pinson Logistics for a refund. I will order another version at a later date.
4,Life with God Bible NRSV,"This is a very readable translation and easy to understand and true to the textual process. I really appreciate the notes and study guides.They are related more to life application in a relationship with God. The leather feels good and it is a nice finish. The Bible however is a little small, so I have to use my reading glasses. This Bible size is 5 1/2 by 7 1/2."
3,Weight Lifting,"Richard Foster has always done a great job in putting together great resources for personal study and spiritual growth. Renovare has added so much to the ministry of others and of pastors for many years. The notes in the Bible have a lot to offer, but the size of this Bible makes it a Bible people will not carry with them, nor use as a portable resource. It is like having a desktop Computer...geat tool, but it stays in one place. The resource would have been far more usable as a ""Bible Companion"" book to be used side-by-side with most people's personal Bible."
2,Is it just me?,"I spend too much time doing product research. On the internet it is possible to evaluate so many choices and there are so many review sites I am teased into believing that I cannot make a poor choice if I am diligent. All well and good except... not one review rated this pot less than excellent for everthing from looks to function. So pleased with my due diligence I ponied up the $75. Well...It is heavy, unbalanced (because of the side handle design), whistles only sometimes (quite confusing this) and the pour stream is ""sloppy"". It does look interesting but achieving this style I believe sacrificed the high function which should always lead in my way of thinking. So much for my research."
5,Wonderful book for educators,This is an outstanding short book for teachers of all ages. It presents a good summary of ideas and suggestions that work in classrooms and that are based on solid research. The book is nicely structured to be used by a single teacher or as a faculty looking to improve their students' learning.
4,Great Compact APS Camera,"This camera is a great compact camera. It has all the basic features of an expensive camera (e.g., zoom, red-eye, self-timer, etc...) and it fits in your pocket. I like the fact that I could just dump it in my pocket without remembering that it is there but having it when I need it.The only downside to this camera is that the really kool feature of mid-roll change is not available. Although Amazon says it has it in the spec description this camera does not support mid-roll change. If that is an important feature then you may consider the Elph 2 model."
4,The 1980s revisited for the new century... and quite well,"The Faint's 2001' album ""Dance Macabre"" is getting renewed interest, in part because of the just-issued ""Dance Macabre Remixes"" album.""Dance Macabre"" (9 songs in 35 min.) is the culmination of The Faint's growth so far. Elements of the synth-driven band can be found in 1985-era Depeche Mode, late 80s/early 90s New Order, Love & Rockets, even early Spandau Ballet. The best songs on the album include the opener ""Agenda Suicide"", ""Total Job"", and best of all ""The Conductor"", with vocoders all over and an irresitible dance-heavy beat, just great!I cannot wait for the next ""real"" Faint album. I don't care much for the new ""Remixes"" album, but meanwhile, we will continue to enjoy this fun and enjoyable album."
5,The 80's called....,"They wish they had a band like The Faint. Saddle Creek mainstays, The Faint, had begun dabbling with synths on Media, long before Blank-Wave Arcade & Danse Macabre. However, where Media was angsty-indie-rock that was more miss than hit, and Blank-Wave Arcade was too synthy, squelchy and sexual, Danse Macabre finds its balance. This album is like a new-wave, hard rock, dance, post-punk, Cure meets Depeche Mode in a steel-cage kinda thing. I don't think there are really any ""weak"" tracks, although some are stronger than others. My favorites are: Agenda Suicide, Let the Poison Spill..., The Conductor, and Ballad of a Paralysed Citizen. Good times."
5,not even close to 80's wannabe's,"You're lost and deluded if you think the faint is a sad immitation of a few bands from years past. They are totally original, fun, metal,synthy,dancy,all of the tracks on this album rock, as well as wet from birth which is a little more fun than this one...but The Faint is one of my absolute favorite bands. I've only seen them in concert once, but it was by far one of the most enjoyable concerts I've been to."
1,Poorly reproduced,I ordered this hoping to use my tablet as a music book but whoever did the scans left a TON of space around the pages so the music is about 6 inches high. I would return this if I had the ability. DO NOT buy the kindle version of this book.
1,French Herb Garden,I have not been able to enjoy the product because it arrived incomple: one of the three pots was missing. I have tried to get reparation from the seller but my efforts have been vain so far. I expect the third pot to be sent to me even if I have to pay for it!Dr. Guy Darlan
5,A classic text,"This will disprove Mark Twain's adage that a claasic is a book that everyone talks about but no-one reads. Not only talk about, read but also enthuse about! A first recommendation for all professionals involved with stroke care, honest, practical and beautifully presented. They don't come much better than this...."
3,Rock Standards Sounding Decidedly Eastern European,"More than just novelty knock-offs a la Bill Shatner, Pat Boone, etc...these cover versions of rock classics come across sounding angelic, or demonic...depending on the timbre of the bellowing voices of the Russian Red Army Choir; whom the Finnish, tonsorally challenged, LENINGRAD COWBOYS picked as background singers. These rock chestnuts have never sounded stranger. Particularly noteworthy is the COWBOYS' take on ZZ TOP's Gimme All Your Lovin, which sounds rather a lot like a cross between a sea shanty and a polka. It may not be rock & roll, but I like it."
1,poor information,"i bought a set of vent shades for a 4door extended cab dodge and contact seller and of coarse if you ever read the rest of the complaints you will know not to bye off this company, they told me i ordered for a 2door but i got a 4pc set but for a 4 door quad cab and now i paid for this and stuck with it"
4,Perfect for puppies,"This soccer ball is small and perfect for puppies. I bought this for my Golden Retriever when he was a puppy. 3 years layer, the soccer ball is gone...but he still has a thing for soccer balls in general!"
2,Doodle-STOP!,"My family are big fans of kids music. We listen to XM Kids all the time. My youngest caught the Doodlebops on Disney and liked the Get on the Bus Song. My husband and I on the other hand can barely tolerate the show.Once we got the DVD, both girls found it average at best which is telling when kids want to play things they like over and over. This DVD has been played twice.The biggest problem I have is the music and the whole show is so contrived. The actors don't actual play music. The actors I am sure do not write any songs. At least the Wiggles wrote their own music and could play instruments. It just seems dishonest."
1,"Drive works great, but watch out for the rebate problems","I've had this USB drive for a couple of months now, works like a champ. With the rebate, this drive is very competitive with lesser brand products.However, Lexar is refusing to give me my rebate. Their reason: The UPC code was not included (which it was). Of course, now I have no way in disputing this as I sent the original in with the rebate form. Repeated emails with the rebate company and Lexar have led nowhere, so I will never buy another of their products again. Buyers beware......"
2,Taking a chance if you buy it,"I have had this product for a couple of months now and loved it, until it stopped working randomly. I have tried it in a number of computers and I get nothing. Just from reading reviews in various places, the drive seems to stop working for a lot of people after 2 - 5 months. Its very annoying since Lexar is advertising its ""durability"". It seems to be hit or miss. Some say they have used it a ton and never had a problem and many seem to have it suddenly break down as it did to me. It was cheap though and for the price it was a nice little toy, but it clearly isn't really much more then a toy. If you get one, be sure to backup your files to a computer often as you risk losing all your saved data someday. All in all, I would not recommend it. Price is good, but remember, you get what you pay for."
2,Rebate denied,Same thing happened with me as other customers. I was denied the rebate because of UPC code not sent but I am sure that I sent it !! Otherwise no problems with the product as yet.
3,"Economical, no-frills choice","The Lexar JumpDrive 128 is a fair, economical, choice for a no-frills USB 1.1 memory drive. The only feature the JumpDrive has a DIP switch that allows users to the drive read-only. The downside of the drive is its cheap construction - the plastic clip on the JumpDrive's cap can easily break off, and the plastic key-chain loop is too fragile for metal key rings. On the other hand, my JumpDrive did survive a trip through the washing machine."
2,Worked well at first,"Mine worked fine at first, but I couldn't use it at home, because my Windows 98 didn't have the right drivers. I searched for them, and when I put the driver on my computer via a floppy disk, my USB drive decided to stop working. It didn't always work on the first try plugging it in to the USB slot (and sometimes took several tries before it died), but this time it was done. It wouldn't work at work anymore, too. I did notice a slight rattle when I shook it, so apparently it broke from the inside, but held up fine on the outside. It was in my front pants pocket just about every day for awhile, and the cap always stayed on, but it couldn't handle being moved around, I guess. Basically, I lost a lot of my data, because it wasn't all backed up on something else. These things are all risky, and make sure you have the important data stored somewhere else, so when it dies, it won't be a huge problem."
5,Gotta get one,"This little device is just amazing! 128MB of stuff! I got tired of firing up the FTP transfer software, sitting there while my machine was tied up transferring, losing the connection halfway through.....the JumpDrive is a great time saving device.And I have never dropped it - in fact I made a little carrying pouch out of heavy bubble wrap and so far its been fine. Think about it......if you were carrying a conventional size, maxtor hard drive and you dropped it, wouldn't you expect it to have a problem? So, treat this Lexar JD gently and you'll probably be fine.One of my favorite tech gadgets!"
2,Joe...Really?,"I thought it would be nice to have a Christmas CD with Joe singing Christmas songs, but to be real...this CD sucks--BIG TIME!!!!! I love listening to Joe as a contemporary artist, but I will not waste any more of my hard earned dollars toward his versions of Christmas music...this CD is so dry, I almost fell asleep listening to it...Major disappointment with this CD."
3,"Same Album From 2009 with 4 new songs, new artwork and title","Joe released another Christmas album back in 2009 which featured six of the songs on this album. There are few new songs on the album Christmas In New York, Christmas Time Is Here,"" ""I'll Be Home for Christmas and a closing jazz flavored version of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Joe is one of the best singers in R&B, however this Christmas album seemed more like a cash cow than album."
2,Disappointed Joe fan,"The cd has no personality and doesn't do him justice. Each song sounds the same, and frAnkly the CD put me to sleep."
5,This game rocks even touh the exeption of the last game was bull@!@#,This game is best of all for thoughs who give it a bad review I have only one thing to say to them f@!&& you. A game like this should treat tihs game with respest.Or else Dante is gonna kick youre ass.
5,EFFING AMAZING,"So I've had my share of games that i beat in a week or let alone an hour, this stopped it. I think the developers are trying to send a message to us to start thinking more when they made the Japanese hard mode our Normal mode. I've gotten headaches and blisters from this game, and im still loving it. Don't judge my rating immediatley though. This game wasn't to fun to start off for me (first DMC game ive played), and I had my ass handed to me at the end of the second level, to figure out theyres no returns. If your a gamer like me you WILL drop f-bombs everynow and then after a lot of playtime ended in a couple hits.Unlike some games where I've lost brain cells from how incredibly RETARTED they are (cough, superman 64, cough), I think ive actually gained some. Now thats good stuff ha"
2,TOO HARD AND UNBALANCED TO ENJOY.......,"YES THIS GAME WILL TAKE THE LIFE OUT OF YOU...ITS SO HARD THAT TO A POINT IT GETS BORING....BASICALLY , YOU SPENT HOURS AND HOURS TRYING TO BEAT EACH LEVEL, THAT BY THE WAY ARE VERY HARD, VERY SHORT, WITH LOTS OF ENEMIES AND A HUGE UNMERCIFUL BOSS THATS WILLING TO TEAR YOU TO SHREADS...( YES IM TALKING ABOUT THAT CERBERUS ICE DOGGY AT THE BEGINING)....I THINK THAT GAMES SHOULD GO FROM EASY-TO MEDIUM-TO HARD AS YOU PROGRESS THRU IT...NOT FROM STAGE 1!!!! ALSO DANTE ACTS VERY STUPID!! YES I KNOW HES SUPPOSED TO BE A TEENAGER ON THIS ONE, BUT STILL TO IMMATURE FOR THE TASK HE NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH.....LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING JOKES WITH THE DEMON SOLDIERS AND CALLING THEM NAMES, AND USING THEM AS A SKATEBOARD AND SWINGING FROM STRIP-POLES SCREAMING WOOOOOOOO!!!!! THATS JUST PLAIN STUPID CONSIDERING HES THE SON OF SPARDA..I THOUGH DEMON-KNIGHTS HAD MORE SERIOUSNESS TO THE JOB.....SHAME ON THIS SEQUEL AND DEFINITELY NOT DEVIL MAY CRY 1......"
3,Another Useless Compilation,"Oingo Boingo had more compilations than any band has a right to and they all suck. Godawful songs like ""Wild Sex In The Working Class"", ""Flesh 'N' Blood"", ""Goodbye-Goodbye"", and ""Sweat"" make their way on this one. Terrible songs like ""Grey Matter"", ""Little Girls"", ""Insects"", and ""Capitalism"" ruin others. This is one group where choosing the highlights is easy. OK so you have to choose the overused and rather bland ""Dead Man's Party"", the fun ""Wierd Science"", and classics ""Who Do You Want To Be?"" and ""Only A Lad"". From there you pick ""Nothing Bad Ever Happens To Me"", ""Winning Side"", ""Gratitude"", ""Stay"", ""Just Another Day"", ""No One Lives Forever"", ""Help Me"", ""Only Makes Me Laugh"", ""On The Outside"", ""Wake Up, It's 1984"", and ""Same Man I Was Before"". From the new direction ""Where Do All My Friends Go?"", ""My Life"", ""New Generation"", and ""Home Again"" from Boi-Ngo and the first 3 songs and maybe some others from Boingo might be OK to fill out the CD. Easy!!!"
3,"Nice, but not really a Workbook","I was looking for another Chakra workbook to accompany my self-development program. While this book is beautiful and has some nice information, I did not find that it assisted me in that quest. Not really what I would consider a ""workbook"" for the user."
4,Rap Rock S**T is SO!! rare today,"We'll, its very rare that you hear rap rock songs like 187. Korn and Nas worked together for Take a Look in the Mirror, Korn and Xzibit worked toghther for the XXX state of the union soundtrack. But if you want to hear the WHOLE!! album with some Gangsta Rap mix with rock, get 187. Also get Jay-Z/Linkin Park Collision Course album with 187s album Furious. But 187 is still one of the best and rare gansta rap & rock band ever. Who knows, maybe there might be no more music like this so I'd appricate these guys and there hit song ""Step Off"" while these guys are around."
5,One of the top ten books of all time,"In an endless sea of business authors who fear controversy, Mark Joyner provides an edgy yet insightful perspective of the psychological warfare involved in successful marketing. A definite must read manual for marketing aficianados."
5,Had to read it for myself,"A few of my close friends kept telling me what a great book this was, but I didn't believe them until I read it for myself. Could a marketing book be any better? Honestly, one of the best I've read so far."
3,uneven,"This album works great with the Naughty and the EPMD and Big Daddy Kane, but do we really need all that R&B?"
4,Learning Icelandic,"While I have not completed the course, I have reviewed it and appears to be a solid teaching method. Icelandic especially requires having the CD for audio as it is a very subtle language for pronunciation.One warning for Amazon UK orders: I ordered mine from the US and a friend ordered at the same time from the UK. She only got the audio CDs while I got the nice book and CDs. This is not the first time this has happened to her for Amazon UK."
3,not exactly a touchdown,"I really can't see how a hetero or bisexual would really enjoy this movie. They played around with the idea or chance of having sex or encouraging sex. It doesn't happen until the end and then all that's there is a male on male sixty-nine. The story misses a good climax in all senses of the word. The plot was intended to be playful, but it just kind of sat there. I usually believe most movies have something to offer, but I'd put this one at the back of the pile. I hate when I can't boast a good find."
2,A disappointment.,"A disappointment.Not to sexually interesting.I like that it pushes some boundaries,and I think some people would like it.Its very short."
2,Rusting,"Three out of the four knives began rusting after only one or two uses. I am not suprised because they were so cheap, but I am surprised by the good reviews. Perhaps my situation is unique, but nothing else in our house is rusting!"
5,great value,"I have a knife fettish,this set has quality steel blades,durable handles,I bought 2 additional sets for gifts"
5,I Believe The Promise,"I have several of Hillsong's cd's. I absolutely LOVE your music. It is literally all I listen to. However, I hope that soon you put out a cd that features the solo singing of Darlene, as in the ""I Believe The Promise"" release. To hear her singing solo brings such awsome blessings to me, (and, I know, to many of my friends as well). We wait in anticipation for a realease of more or her solo singing. Thank you so very much. God Bless you all, for blessing us with your music.In The Lord, Karen M. Reimann"
1,peeling decal,"Went on my car window nice and clean, but started peeling within a few days from the top and bottom. over the week, it got worse, so eventually I had to take it off."
2,"Awesome looking sticker, it just didn't....stick","Got it pretty quick, when I received it, it looked very nice. So I slapped it on, came out the next morning and it was on the ground. I guess the stickyness just wasn't enough, or it was an old sticker. Good luck, maybe mine was a bad apple out of the bunch."
1,Just horrible,"I am amazed that this book was rated 5 stars - must be the author's friends. Not a word in this book rings true - it's only 114 pages and I could write 114 pages on how terrible it truly is. Every page the author feels the need to make up a bizarre story to try and keep the readers interest. In the first 50 pages we heard about beatings of strippers, men paying $288 ($288?????) for ten minutes of a stripper's time, the serial killer next door, the husband and wife team shooting out neighbors windows, attempted rape, blah, blah, blah. I made it to page 50 and threw the book away. Just the worst literary experience of my life! All of the positive reviews are by people with only one review....except Donald, who mentions this book in every single review he gives. BEWARE!!"
3,Conundrum - Am I right in reviewing a product that I returned?,"I ordered the Crescent 38"" Black Guitar with accessories from Austin Bazaar. The product arrived within the shipping time indicated on the website...But I had a lot of trouble tuning the D, A and E strings. I used all of the spare strings provided with the product to no avail. I guess at this price the guitar looked like a bargain and I was unlucky to grab one of indifferent quality.I returned it back and am still waiting for the refund. The shopping experience with Austin Bazaar has been satisfactory though...So my suggestion to those who want to buy this product...Do it if you are a bit od a risk taker...But if you can afford a little more buy one with a proper electronic tuner (the pitch pipe is crappy for beginners...)All the best!"
2,Children Or Young Adults Only!,"Thought this book was an adult, paperback adaptation of this Star Trek Nemesis movie. If you aren't an adult, avoid this copy of the book!"
2,Not really a USB 2.0 cable,"Although Amazon lists this product as a USB 2.0 cable, it in fact is not. The package states the cable is capable of transmitting data at 12 Mbps and does not claim to be a USB 2.0 cable. There are cheaper USB extension cables on Amazon that perform at that level. Might want to check them out instead of buying this one."
5,Awesome!,"Once again, Hillsongs rock! I love the message behind the music and the anointing. Truly, anointed and it makes you want to stay in the presence of God."
4,Love the song,I bought this for me and a friend just for the song Hallelujah. I must say that I listen to the same song over and over. Some of the other songs are good. Some of them I do not like. But for the price you have to listen to Jeff Buckley sing Hallelujah.
1,Disappointed...,This product made the picture way more blurry than the original composite video wire. Then it completely stopped working altogether. Its intended use was for a Epson Moviemate LCD projector. Will continue to use just the composite videowire only as it puts out an adaquate picture.
5,You can't beat these for fit and quality!,"Made in the USA. The quality and fit/finish is excellent. Highly recommended! This product is a fine example of the phrase, ""you gotta pay to play."" Go ahead and play, if you can afford it. You won't regret the purchase, especially after your first winter!I have them in my 2006 Nissan Frontier. For this vehicle, be sure to check to see if you have one or two mat holding pins."
2,Dirty Little Secrets? Hardly . . .,"The title of this book is misleading . . . it leads one to assume that the book contains a number of hidden and little known facts and figures that influenced the 20th century, when it reality it is just one man's oddyssey into the social and political forces and changes that occurred in the 20th century. No references to anything is given, so as history it is very weak. General trends are noted, most of which are obvious anyway, and some parallels with the past are noted. It is a nice, quick easy read and may turn up a few items that you weren't aware of before, but anyone familiar with current events or recent history will not be impressed. An example from the book: Why do Americans live longer than other peoples in third world countried? Answer: Better sanitation! A secret? You decide."
5,Great for Xmas for all Pokemon-fans,"Nice versions of Xmas songs by Ash, Misty, Pikachu and other stars of Pokemons. Gift for my daughter, she loves to watch Pokemons."
4,Great Camcorder,"Awsome buy!for the price I got everything I wanted and everything was how the specs. said. A note about other comments: sometimes people do not read the specifics carefully enough and therefore think the product was not what they expected...also, sometimes people don't read the instructions well enough (or at all) and thus make flip remarks that the product doesn't work right.I gave it one less star than perfect beause of the touch screen. I am a woman with small fingers and even I had a hard time with the buttons near all the edges of the screen and had to turn my finger to the side to get them to read that I was touching the button. But it's not a big deal, I manage around that."
2,Yawn!,"Not even close to what it could have been. Subjects were snoozefest. Sorry, but I would have to pass on this one again."
2,Charlie and Lola Vol. 1-8,I found problem in Vol.3. We could not open this DVD. Is there a way to exchange? -Chao-Ying Davis
5,great sensor - cheapo batteries,"bought a second one of these to give to a recent graduate. first one has worked flawlessly and has great battery life. the batteries in the new unit had leaked in the packaging forcing me to open up and clean the package before putting in fresh USA made Duracell batteries and reseal.Note to Kidde: if you can't send good batteries, don't send any."
3,Kind of pointless..,"This sleeve is a huge pain to take off and even more of a pain to put on. I would guess that if you do buy this -- once you take it off to put the batteries in - your not going to want to put it back on. It takes up way to much time.The good thing about it is that it gives it a little colour, but it also keeps your controller separate from the others. The sleeve would of been a lot better if they left an open spot so you could put the batteries in without having to take it off."
2,split skins,"These skins look real cool and feel great. But that is the only good thing about them. They are extremely hard to put on and have no give. I guess that could be a good thing but it makes it very difficult to take off to change the batteries in the controller. Hence, two of them have split at the bottom. They still work but it won't be long before the splits travel up the skin and render it unusable. Will try a different tpe of skin next time."
2,It is more what you lose than what you get,"I bought these protector Sleeves for my Wii remote controls hoping to find a cover and avoid deteriorating my control, and they certainly do that. The problem is that silicon protector is hard to get in place, and also hard to take out, so when you need to change batteries and that would be as frequent as you use for long time your Wii, you have to take out protection and then place it back again. Also, this protectors are not compatible with any control extension like tennis racket, fire gun, zapper pistol, or baseball bat, so, if you want to use these funny toys, you have to take out again protector and when finish, place it back. So, definitely, I decided not to use them, because what I get for good, I think deserves less work. However, nunchuck protection can be always on place and it gives you ""personalized nunchuck"" for everyone in the family if you use different colors. I bought blue, pink, green and black."
3,Elton proves his point,"With 1983's highly successful 'Too low for zero' Elton was claimed to have had a come-back. It was probably a relief the one time hazily drawn teen idol had stopped trying to burn up the dance floor in a disco gaze of 'please buy my records' desperation. Well, it was a relief for those allergic to genre anarchy.For all the hype, 'Too low for zero' is often shallow 80's pop that purveys foppish sentiment. Not that this is a bad thing for Elton John. But it doesn't rock like either 'Jump Up' or 'Breaking Hearts', and is slightly less memorable than both.However, you can't pass over the strength of the better tracks, such as the warm country power ballad 'I guess that's why they call it the blues' (which may win Guinness world book of records feat for ""longest title of song to become a big hit"") and the icy yet heart-wrenching 'One more arrow'. Only the distasteful 'Whipping Boy' is a real dud. Rating **1/2 (2.5)"
2,Not worth it,"Im sorry but this cd is just not any good, to me at least. I felt like I was in some country music bar owned my jamaicans. Maybe one or two songs might be good but the majority of the CD is not worth even 5 bucks. This cd will remain at the bottom of my cd rack. Maybe I expected too much, There aint nothing all too deep about this cd. Its stale.I do however still and always will love reggae, dont get me wrong. :)"
3,This cd is ok,i thought this cd was ok it wasnt all that alls it was was a 10 year old boy following in the foot steps of his brother. The songs are to pepped up. The only song i liked was shake it.
1,Rubbish,when i heard this was one of the backstreet boys brothers i knew i would be dissapointed.this is absolute trash.he should take some singing lessons from HANSON.thank goodness somebody invented the hammer
4,ADORABLY CUTE!!,"I saw Aaron Carter when he opened for BSB last summer. I thought he was so cute singing w/ his huge clothes(they looked like he had borrowed them from Nick) and his songs were just....awesome. I had to have the CD, he may be the same age as my younger brother, but he has a cute voice that will one day be as good as his older brothers...i can see it coming though!"
2,he's not THAT bad....but he sure isn't good,"Come on. The main reason peeps are buying this is cuz he's Nick's brother. I mean, I like BSB and all, but if you think they're bubblegum (well they SORTA are), just listen to THIS. I mean he covered an NKOTB song for cripes sake! Though when I went to a BSB concert in July '98, he put on a better show as one of the opening acts then Jimmy Ray, i'll give him that.So he's like 11 years old. So what? I think he has some SLIGHT potential, but not much, and this stuff could pass for Alvin and the Chipmunks too. No matter what his age, face it: he's got minimal talent."
2,????,I just don't know what to say? He is 11yrs old. He is already singing about girls and falling in love...That is the samething Nick sings about...but he is much older. He should just sing about things that just happen to him in a day.
1,As if we didn't have enough one-hit wonders in '98...,This cd reeks horribly. Anyone who likes this needs to get a L-I-F-E! This is just so damn pathetic it's not even funny!
1,so much sugar it'll ruin your teeth.,"This cd is so sugary, your teeth will fall out. It's not worth the plastic it comes in. I don't think I need to explain how bad this is. Just look at the song titles, ""Crazy Little Party Girl""???? Aaron doesn't have potential either, I hope this is his last album."
2,Okay for his age,"My sister has this CD and I have had to listen to it many times. There was really nothing on there that impressed me, his voice is monotonous, and all the songs sound kind of the same. Maybe in a few years his voice will sound better and he'll have better songs."
1,i love crushing this cd,"this cd is good for one thing, destroying. I stole about 15 copies of this cd from various stores and I LOVE beating the crap out of it with my sledge hammer. Aaron is such an ugly kid, and his music is horrible. If anyone has the Aaron cd and has nothing else to do with it, I'll pay ya $5 so I can beat it up, just email me at whygodwhy@hotmail.com"
1,well....,"i know he's young and stuff, and his voice isn't fully developed but he's too young to be in the music biz. couldn't he have waited till he was old enough and had a more developed voice?"
3,Dinosaurs come alive from the 20's to the 60's,"This is another documentary about Dinosaur Movies. Its got all the history of movies like ""The Lost World"" (1925), ""Godzilla"" (1954), and ""King Kong"" (1933). It has never before shown trailers from classic dinosaur movies, but right in the middle of them, a guy starts talking about the movie. Shut Up and let me see the trailer. Much Better than ""Godzilla-mainia"""
1,Don't bother,Word does not have a template for this item and the company sent some strange .ext which couldn't be opened. What a waste of money.
5,TRAIL OF TEARS,"GREAT MOVIE, A LOT OF HISTORY IN THIS MOVIE. ME BEING PART CHEROKEE MYSELF, THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING. WOULD RECOMMEND IT."
5,It Tell's the Truth,"I am a Cherokee from Oklahoma now living in Colorado. In this movie, what you will get is not a classic western but the tragic truth about a people that regardless of their ability to adapt, to welcome their distant neighbours and indeed to welcome and to even embrace progress clearly displaying this adaptability to change were nevertheless out of greed driven out of their own homeland and nearly driven to extinction only to once again, adapt to change and once again, many are succeeding."
5,fits perfect,"I owned one of these before, and it lasted for about 15 years. Granted, that was not in the full sun all day every day, but it was out alot! So pleased, I sought out the exact same one. I was also pleased that their sizes or labeling didn't change. I found the tag on the seam of the old one, and was able to order the exact same thing. Good product"
2,Poor Quality,"After opening the product, I noticed that it looked dirty - as if there were cobwebs or something on the rubbery pieces. I decided to wash it. Most of the color began seeping out of the wooden balls at that point, which concerns me. That suggested to me that my parrot may wind up ingesting coloring as it comes off so very easily. Then after closer inspection, the rubbery pieces weren't very well cut or separated, and the product may have just generally been aged. The dirt and various debris on it tells me it has probably been sitting in a warehouse for a while.Most toys this size in a pet store would cost more than $5.00, so I guess you get what you pay for. I do like the size of the product and where they were going with it. Just wish quality could have been better. After soaking the toy for a good bit and wiping it down very well, I'm sure it will be decent for my parrot. She is very picky about toys and probably won't even play with it anyway."
1,Get a clue here folks,"It figures that Emilio below only bought the paperback. He doesn't disclose his agenda (scientologist, or just someone who NEEDS a shrink) but he obviously has no idea what he is talking about. If Emilio lives near you watch out, because he may go postal or try to poison the water supply. (He probably moved his lips while reading the book, and he clearly needed help typing his review). Take a pill Emilio. Cornwell hasn't a clue. Oh yea, it is all a conspiracy."
4,Old but still viable,"Sure, this textbook is older than my students, and it is grammar heavy, but it's also a great companion to good teaching as a map. It also has reading selections for each lesson which is one of the most important ways to learn a language (see The Read-Aloud Handbook). A good tool. The main downside for me is that since it's so old it doesn't have modern vocab for a lot of the things the kids want to know about like video games and ipods; also the culture notes and photographs are outdated. But again, it's a great tool in many ways."
3,Good for video games but DVD player is terrible,"I bought this TV to play my Xbox 360 on and for that it's great. The image quality is excellent and the sound is very good too.However, I recently found out that the DVD player on it has broken! This seems to be a pretty common problem. It doesn't bother me much because I can watch DVDs with my Xbox, but if you don't have a seperate DVD player and you want to watch DVDs, you should probably skip over this TV."
3,Cute Commercials,Most of the commercials were from the 1950's and 1960's. All of them were in black and white except for the Charlie's Angels Dolls commercial. The commercials were cute and I did enjoy watching them. I expected to see more commercials in color from the 1970's which the video did not show.
3,family time,"as a parent i noticed that my child was espending more time watching tv, so i purchase a couple of games and i really enjoy this type of games because i can challenge my kid to act and think about team group and its a way to keep us closer and at the same time have fun while we challenge one another. so lets dont forget that our children are our biggest treasures and even 15 minutes with them it means so much."
2,Good tactics disappointing writing,"The mark of a good book, be it a work of fiction or a manual on deer hunting, lies in the ability of the author to write well. Greg Miller may be a good hunter but his writing style has much to be desired. My love of hunting was the only thing that kept me reading this book."
3,I agree with everything the next review says.,"The interior world WAS interesting, But it just WASN'T Indy's kind of place. A little too off the wall, even for Indiana Jones."
1,Pointless and Contrived,"I seriously can't believe this book was ever published. The story is ridiculous. An unoriginal plot device is introduced in practically every other chapter: shapeshifting, a ghost ship, gates between worlds, a magical unicorn staff?! Indiana Jones comes off as a third-rate version of himself.I understand that these novels were published in the early 90's, probably quite hastily with the sole purpose of cashing in on the Indiana Jones brand. They were probably also intended for younger readers. I just think the powers that be are missing an opportunity to put out a genuine work of literature (think in the style of Raymond Chandler or Ernest Hemingway) about one of the greatest heroes ever."
2,"Nice attempt at creativity, but a failure","To be honest, I had to force myself to finish this book. While I credit MacGregor for trying to take Indiana Jones in new directions with this series, I simply couldn't buy it. In this last book, MacGregor strays way too far from archaeological facts and simply creates his own world. He has simply placed the character of Indy into a novel of his own invention, without regard for the character itself. While I admire his daring with the character, I feel that it simply doesn't work."
5,nice album,This album is nice for the price. You can put text on each page or not -- looks good both ways. Pics easy to move from one page to another.
4,Great gift!,"I bought this as a gift for someone and she loved it. When I got first got it in the mail, it was a little bigger than I expected but it was fine. The way the pages were designed, it was just a little difficult to slide the pictures in correctly. You have to do it delicately because sometimes the plastic tears off the page easily. I accidentally tore two pages trying to get pictures in. Other than that it's a great photo album. There's large enough margins to write a little something for each picture too. And in the back, there's even a slot to insert discs if you want. You can change the front image of the album too so that was nice. Overall, a nice looking photo album that I would recommend."
2,Wraeththu,"I bought the first and third books of the trilogy in a second-hand shop for a dollar, one of the best bargains I've ever made. Unfortunately I've never been able to get a hold of the second book - which is extremely frustrating. However, I found the other two make for compulsive reading (and re-reading). The concept of mankind's evolution from single sex beings to beings that utilise the possibilities of both sexes is fascinating. The characterisations are brilliant and quite easily imagined especially that of Calanthe. I whole-heartedly enjoyed these books, and eagerly await the day that I find the middle book."
2,Just kidding,"I acctually loved this book (five stars). I read it while I was stationed in Korea, and it provided a great escape from an all-to-often bad environment. Great book!"
5,GREAT Sci-Fi,"Probably the best science fiction book I've read. I'm a bigger fantasy fan than I am SCI-FI, but found this quite mystical and intriguing. I DID find it mind-blowing and EXTREMELY creative and well written."
3,Interesting.....But,I'll admit that I did not finish this book. As good as her writing is (5 stars). I had a very hard time getting into the story. As much as the book keeps repeating the fact that these characters are not human. My mind kept on telling me that this was nothing but a thinly disguised story about gay men who did not like females and for who females do not matter in the whole scheme of things. Otherwise she tells a very interesting story and if this sort of thing doesn't bother you. It's well worth your time
4,"Nice Sweatshirt, beware of fit","The sweatshirt is of a nice quality, but the fit is very narrow on the bottom, compared to the top fit. I bought an extra large for my son-in-law and the bottom and the sleeve bottoms were tight for an extra large. But, he wears it proudly and was very happy with the gift."
2,Not what I thought,"If you are looking for a documentary - this isn't it. If you thought to find an anthology of the master's recordings - you won't find it here. The DVD consists of an early Italian movie about Caruso's childhood and early career. Don't get me wrong: It is not a bad movie, just dated and instead of English subtitles, the original Italian was dubbed (badly) with English voices. There are a few pages of Biography, and a few recordings from 1910. All in all, I think that whoever produced this DVD could have easily done a much better job!"
5,"Sturdy, casual shirt",Got a couple of these shirts for my birthday today. Washed them and tried them on. Very good fit 3XL.....true to size. Immediately became my two favorite shirts as they feel thick and comfortable. Looks great with a white Hanes lay flat collar undershirt. Great value at $16.99.....I will be buying more of these.
2,Kinda cheap,"Have worn these for years for work and loved them,the last ones I ordered are nothing like the older ones I had.They are ill fitting,cut much smaller in the chest & arms, also the fabric is rough and scratchy feeling.I won't be buying anymore of these,they are kinda cheap fitting and feeling."
2,Flywheels XPV,"I was very disappointed with this product. For the amount that we paid for the XPV with the battery pack (about $100.00) it should last much longer. My son got it for Christmas and played with it a couple of times and it was pretty cool. But it is so fragile, that it already won't fly anymore. If I had paid $30.00 for it I wouldn't be nearly as upset about it. I wouldn't suggest buying this product until either the price comes down, or the quality goes up."
1,Would not recommend,If you are looking for any information on Dian Fossey's work with her beloved mountain gorillas please give this book a pass. I did not learn a thing about the gorillas or Dian's work until I picked up Woman in the Mists by Farley Mowat. The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey is nothing more than salacious gossip most of which is uncited! Truly awful!
4,Wonderful prints...,"I love the peacefulness of Diane R.'s prints. I checked all over the internet and found Amazon to have the best price for the print plus no shipping or tax made it a steal. Beware, however, as the print is not as bright as the picture above. I found it to have much paler colors which is why I gave it a 4 rating instead of a 5, but it's still beautiful."
1,"stupid ""reference"" book with mistakes","if i could, i'd give it no stars!!! lame book. lots of errors. even though it is a guide to the friday films, it glosses over several of the latter movies. why? too much trouble???? and I have to agree with previous comments laugh at alot of the reviews here, most of them likely written by the same person! that's just sad, and kinda lame."
3,Porgy and Bess,"I have the original record soundtrack of the play starring Dorothy Dandridge, etc. This was NOT an original soundtrack. I liked about half the songs; the remainder did not come close to the original, and several important songs were left out (Picnic Day)."
5,Fabulous Christmas Album,"Dale Watson has a wonderful, emotional, deep voice and these songs are a delight. I put this album on and just listen over and over...some of the songs like ""Christmas Time In Texas"", ""Hot Texas Christmas Day"" and ""Santa and My Semi"" sound like they should be classics. I'm not in nor from Texas, but it makes me wish I was. ""Christmas Love"" is a bouncy, romantic song with Danni Leigh doing a duet with Dale. This is a wonderful album...his voice is perfect."
2,decent read,Decent read. Got a bit slow and dragged on in some parts but I really liked the characters. :-) They seemed believable. Wish that the Sir Hartington would have stayed alive longer to have the heroine confront him again though instead of bringing in another villain that basically antagonized a whole different character.
2,mediocre mounting,"My husband says the mirror itself is great, but it has yet stay completely on the wall - one side continually disconnects."
4,Lighted Mirror,"The product was easy to install. I used the suction cups provided. I have a fiberglass shower. The light works Ok, could be brighter. My shower is quite dark so the clock is hard to read. I have had no trouble with the mirror fog up. That part of the mirror is as advertised."
1,Fogless it's not,"While I did not have the battery problems mentioned by other reviewers, I also had problems with the mirror fogging within a month of use. There appears to be a chemical coating on the plastic mirror that deteriorates over time. Now it functions a just another mirror that must be wiped constantly if it's used in the shower. For $30, you can do much better elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money,"Can't complain about it not being fogless because the only truly fogless mirrors are the ones that attach to the shower head and have water running through. However, right after the warranty ended most of the clock's segments stopped working. Then one of the two LEDs. Also, razor holder will not hold Gillette's Fusion. This was my first of two different Zadro mirrors. Both were junk."
4,"It's the journey, not the destination","John Grinder and Judith Delozier provide the reader with a journey through one of their seminars. It wakes you up to your life. Or, more accurately, it can. I have read almost every NLP in print and pretty much all of the ones out of print. I hold certifications in NLP and Ericksonian Hypnosis as well a my Unversity education as an anthropologist. I found this book a bit of a stretch for my vocabulary, and a wonderful journey through a series of highly transformative experiences. Read it with your mind open and do the drills and you will find your life changing."
4,Megaman X Command Mission commands attention.,"I've never been too big a fan of turn-based action games.Megaman X Command Mission grabbed my attention though, and I've beenthrough hours of enemies exploded and being hammered by bosses. While the bosses can be a little frustrating, it's great to go back and completely destroy the enemies you faced in earlier levels, that is after you upgrade a bunch. I recommend that you find all the items before things rap up. Decent graphics and voice selection for the characters, the costumization is enjoyable. Definitely a good buy."
2,Not good,If you are into games like FFVII then this is your game. This isn't like the average Mega Man game you would be used to playing. I am not a fan at all of these type of RPG's. Im more of a hack and slash or shoot em up bang bang gamer and this is not even close to that. Too much talking and not enough action.
2,Needs some editing,"This book has a lot of good info, but is riddled with silly errors, nonsensical text, references to figures that either don't exist or which discuss something else in the text and general clutter not to mention amateurish illustrations. In places it seems like all three authors wrote their own paragraph on a topic and rather than condense them down they instead printed all three back to back!The overall usefulness of the book is clouded because of this. If the authors and editor couldn't catch some of these basic flaws, who is to say that anything else is valid?"
5,Mardo Williams is an American treasure.,"This is an important book.It reminds us of what we've lost. Read it and pass it down a generation. Joanna Wolper, New York City"
3,Louvers Flap Like Crazy,"As the other review stated, the gravity operated louvers open fine when fan is on. The problem is if you have any significant wind: 10-15mph or higher they flap and loudly crash closed over and over...I secured them in the winter so they couldn't open. If you have the fan installed anywhere near a bedroom as I do you'll hear them on windy nights..."
2,Good idea marred by mediocre writing,"I really wanted to like this book, but I found myself consistently disappointed by the underdeveloped characters and lackluster descriptions. For such a quirky story, the writing could have been far *more* quirky. Awkward plot transitions and predictable twists didn't help, either.I bought this book for five dollars, and I'm glad I didn't spend more on it. This could have been a very imaginative, original story, but the author didn't seem to know what to do with it. I left this story feeling like I only knew one character: Theo. The others remained frustratingly indistinct, and all the mermaids and Hardy Boy references floating through the text couldn't change that."
3,just image !,THIS BOOK CONTAINS OLNY PHOTOGRAPHS. I purchased this book to know the Martin Margiela's Design Method or design thinking. but for me it's not helpful.
2,not their greatest song,"This is happy pop and dance music, but Passion Fruit have already seen better songs. Unfortunately the group Passion Fruit does no longer exist. Two members died in a plane crash, one member survived. The record company is planning no new formation."
5,new and old,"This album really cooks, I think you'll play it over and over... new and old artists combined in a real WOW cd !!"
3,Longnecks and Short Stories,"""I'll Think of Something"" makes this CD worth every penny. There are other good slow songs on here,too, but about half are upbeat or honky tonk."
2,technical,"A nice fascimile of an old book. It has his own value as a historical piece. Though the interesting stuf is published in volume two, which apparantly is not jet reprinted by doover"
4,Well Made.,Well made... Will do what its meant to do... no more ...no less... Red plastic tray with 2 adjustable brackets to hold gun & cleaning rods etc... Decent size...
1,Useless,"This product is useless.I bought it probably just over 5 years ago.Power went out for maintenance with my big screen TV plugged in.A surge blew out the PM board and the capacitors on it.Dead TV. ~$500-$750 to fix.Only has a 5 year warranty on any product plugged in.Even worse. With everything you need to do for a claim and repairs, it will be 2-3 months before I would have my TV set fixed.After all of that, If I want to get a new TV they will pay ""blue book"" on my TV that worked fine but probably is worth $100 or less.DO NOT USE. It will not protect your equipment and their warranty is worthless."
1,Worst Episode Of The Series!,"Out of every episode of the long run of Star Trek: The Next Generation I have only disliked a few episodes and I have to say that Sub Rosa is the episode that I dislike the most, my #1 least favorite episode followed by Samaritan Snare at #2 and Justice at #3. Beverly Crusher is one of my favorite characters but there are much better episodes that focus on her. I think this is the worst episode of the series but of course that is just a matter of personal opinion!"
5,Great Product,"I've ordered this product a couple of times now. It is a very light oil and has very little fragrance (not absent, just mild and light). I have tried a couple of other brands and so far this one is my favorite."
5,Now almond oil,"This is another product I use daily, both for face, hand and body moisturizing. Completely free of chemicals, which is much better for the skin. And by the way I look younger than my 66 years - I am told."
1,No smell to it!,I bought this hoping for a nice almond aroma. It smells like nothing at all. Complete total waste of money!
2,No fragrance....,"I just purchased this oil. And, as two other reviewers have already commented, the oil has NO fragrance. I was looking for something with the almond smell. Also, I am disappointed that the product itself does not state what type of almond it uses for its ""sweet almond oil"" I wonder if this is the reason there is no smell. So, due to a lack of information from website, amazon info, and product, and the lack of fragrance I am rating this product poorly.I will say that the oil however was not sticky or greasy. It absorbed right away."
3,Wish it smelt like Almonds!,"This oil has all the properties of Almond Oil.. I use it for hair, face masks and moisturizer. Unfortunately, it has a vegetable kitchen oil kind of smell - I'm thinking regular Almond Oil smells like Almonds? Well, that's the only thing I was looking forward to that didn't deliver. Otherwise, great product for the price!"
2,Leaking bottle,"I received this oil only a few days ago, but it was leaking from the get-go. The entire bottle was greasy on the outside, it left an oil ring on my pants (that I'm hoping has come out) and wherever I set it down, a little ring would appear. I have now taken it out of the bottle and put it in a tupperware container which is super inconvenient for applying it but I couldn't leave it in the container that causes rings of oil everywhere."
3,A must for any H-I-M collection.,"...>its basicaly got all the singles from Razorblade, Greatest Love Songs and Deep Shadows with a few remixes and live tracks thrown in.though the only songs i havn't heard are:-I've crossed oceans of wine to find youRebel Yell ...and Dark Sekret Love.They are all brilliant songs though, and i do recomend this set for any HIM fans who want to complete their collection..."
1,Emo flith,"Complete and utter trash. If you enjoy some guy who can't sing whine about love and how he dosnt have any in every single song. then your as pathetic as Him(double meaning alert!)in short, waste of time, money and brain cells"
1,Play the theme to the Twlight Zone while you read this book,"Reading Robert Cohen's A-Z book is like watching an episode of the Twilight Zone -- a grain of truth is exploded into a big, disturbing fantasy. This dreary little tome is full of innaccurate information about Cancer, Diabetes and Acne (Cohen claims that milk is the root of all of these evils). If you enjoy conspiracy theories and paranoia, this book is for you; if you actually wish to be educated about health and consumer issues related to dairy, you will want to look elsewhere."
1,Book for idiots,"This guy completely ignores the fact that organic and/or natural milk is great for you. I felt like I was reading a sermon, not a book."
3,not very stable,"I purchased this product from Amazon because the stores near me only carry extremely ugly colors. The reviews seemed good, but after putting it up, it is not very stable. As you pull a knife off the wall the whole thing tilts and almost comes off completely. You have to hold the thing up against the wall as you strategically pull and twist the knife off of it. Maybe we didn't install it properly, but who knows considering it didn't come with any instructions whatsoever."
4,"Sturdy, Affordable Knife Magnet","We installed two of these over the counter to store a wide selection of knives -- paring through cleaver -- and it holds everything quite sturdily. The magnet runs the length of the strip, with no 'weak' spots (a problem with a similar Ikea product that had gaps in between magnets). My only concern is the possibility of the plastic brackets that the strip snaps onto wearing out over time, but as we won't be popping the strip off and on this hopefully won't be a problem"
4,Functional...,...That is the best thing I can say about this. The magnetic strips are strong and secure. I installed it above my kitchen sink and there is absolutely no fear that they will fall.But boy is it ugly. It is just a metal bar sitting above my sink. I suppose if I had a really nice set of knives it wouldn't matter. It does the job and for the price it can't be beat.
5,Equine Accupressure A working Manual,I have read the book and veiwed the video. I also attended a workshop taught by one of the authors. I strongly recommend contacting tallgrass publications and attending a workshop. It has benefited me as well as my horses and dogs.
4,Minolta Auto Elcetroflash,Received the item in a timely fashion. It is the exact model of the original flash that I had broken. Works great with my old camera.
4,AC Adapter Should be Included,"I love the size of this camera and have only taken a few photos with it. I have not been able to print them because I did not realize it was necessary to have an AC adpter to load the photos into the computer to print! I have just ordered an adapter, but I think either the adapter should be included in the kit or there should be a warning that it is necessary, and not just an accessory."
3,Cyn is the key,"Cynssyr is terrific. What a guy! Not possible to say enough good things.Anne...why won't she trust him? He proves himself over and over. She is not very intuitive about people; she is too trusting of everyone else. Otherwise she's a decent heroine, and I like that she's older.The mystery was not very good; it seemed forced. But the love story is quite good. Three and 1/2 stars."
4,Likable characters,"Pretty good story. The love scenes were a little more graphic than I expected--ok, a LOT more--and I was a little disappointed in who the villain turned out to be since I kinda liked the person. But it was surprising, so I can't complain about the suspense. The characters were all very likable and I wonder if there are (or will be) stories involving certain minor characters. :o)"
1,not something i would re read.. didn't like it,the book was well written but i didn't like it... i could not like this hero... he is just a bad person.. i have seen this book mentioned on alot of message boards of people who love to read and really liked this book.. so i could not wait to read it.. but was disapppointed when i read it.. i have loved books by this author before..
2,"Way, way to much ""Katie""","I will not repeat the story line of this book because other reviews have done a good job of that. No one has mentioned that the lead male, Ruan, has a mistress, by the name of Katie Forrest, that we first hear about early in the book on page 54. Ruan marries Anne and then Katie is an ex-mistress, however she never leaves the story, she is mentioned on at least 39 different pages and she is mentioned on each of the last 5 pages of the book as Ruan and Anne declare their love for one another. On one of those last pages, Ruan even asks Katie if she will have him back if he is a divorced man in love with another woman. In a book with 342 pages that means she is mentioned on one out of each 10 pages. I was very tired of reading about Katie. I think this book has a good story line, however I thought there was way, way to much about Katie in it and she is why I only give this book two stars."
1,Terrible product - light weight,This is the lightest weight card stock I have ever used. It is so wimpy that I won't ever buy this brand again.
2,Quality of paper,I am disappointed in the quality of the paper. It is too lightweight for greeting cards. It is the first time I have tried Printworks but probably won't buy it again for cardstock.
2,"The operative word here is ""Lightweight""","I'm still searching for a really amazing, knock my socks off Adobe Acrobat book, that will take me beyond what I could find in the Acrobat help, or figure out myself. I can capably make a PDF from Word or any other application, I don't care about embedding multimedia, and I still see a sore need to find a book that covers forms really well. This book fails both the breadth test and the depth test; it might as well be one of the ""dummies"" books. Thanks for nothing!"
3,Ghosts and powers off,Picture quality is poor and the damn thing out of the blue powers off then comes back up. Will do this now and then.
2,"Okay, but not great","The DynaTrap is easy to install and is quiet. However, it does NOT do an effective job of eliminating biting insets. It does eliminate all the moths in the immediate area, but sitting just a few feet away we are still getting bitten by mosquitos and biting flies. It is not the solution we were looking for."
1,Not worth the money,The Dynatrap primarily captured moths. I found zero mosquitoes and few other undesirable insects. Primarily I found small moths in the trap. I threw the thing away and realize I wasted $100. I do not recommend this product at all!
1,Waste Of Money,Sounded good on paper but end result is just a fan that may suck the bugs into it. Expensive thumbs down.
2,I would not recommend this for mosquitoes only other bugs,I thought this would take the mosquitoes away it only collected moths. not sure if i would recommend thisto anyone.
1,Does nothing,"I am probably the original mosquito magnet, but this year they are even biting my spouse and biting during the day! I read reviews, and the Dynatrap sounded pretty good. Once I got it, however, another story. The cord is not very long so I couldn't place it where I wanted. No biggie there. BUT, it caught practically NOTHING-- just a couple of moths."
2,Dynatrap disappoints,"I live in rural Maine where we have real bugs. This did nothing for black flies and does catch some mosquitos, but not enough to make a difference. It IS a great moth catcher. But I have nothing against moths and they don't bite. I should have spent the extra for a propane unit."
2,"Caught lots of moths, few mosquitos, bulbs died after 2 weeks","Simply a case of sounds to good to be true (eliminating mosquitos without spending $400+ for a LP gas unit). You'll notice the product states it is an ""insect eliminator"" not a mosquito eliminator. I got the device, plugged it in and left it running all night. The next morning I had a hard time picking out 1 dead mosquito from the pile of moths and beetles in the trap. After about 2 weeks of nighttime use I noticed that the bulbs started pulsating for no reason then died the next day even though they are listed as working for 3000 hours. If you've got a serious moth issue then this is your solution. But if you're dealing with mosquitos then keep looking elsewhere"
3,"Catches bugs, but not many mosquitoes",This is a good flying insect trap but it does not seem to attract many mosquitoes. Ours also broke after a year when a beetle got caught in the fan and the fan motor burned out.
3,A fairly decent product for my purposes,I bought this unit last month to help control the indoor fungus gnat population which come from all my potted plants. It seems well suited to this purpose. Though the lights burned out after less than a month and I had to replace them. I emailed the company when it happened and still haven't recieved a reply. Customer service is questionable.
1,Does not catch mosquitos,"We've had this thing running for a month now and it hasn't caught a single mosquito. The trap is filled with moths and ladybugs, but the mosquitoes encircle the device and seem to laugh at it as they quickly lose interest in the allure of its light and fan and and redirect their attention to my wife's body. I would not recommend this product."
1,Not working,This device is a joke. It didn't cacth one insect.We pluged it in for 7 days 24/7 no result.I am shiping it back.
1,This book did not deliver what it promised.,"The back cover of the book promised it to be 'the complete how-to handbook'. However, the authors omitted the most common of Bridal Shower activities: the games. The only reference to games is: "" Games have been the mainstay of showers for a long, long time. They give people who may be strangers something to do and create an element of fun. Several can be found in (here they advertise ANOTHER book they've written) SO THEY WON'T BE FOUND HERE....Frankly, if Amazon had a 'minus' star rating, I would've awarded it to the authors of this book. This book was a disappointment, and as far as I'm concerned- falsely advertised."
4,Interesting,"Dry in some spots but overall a decent read. I read this book for a class so I wasn't head over heels excited to read it but the professor could have chosen a worse book. I rented it for $6 for 30 days on kindle, a good choice if it's for school."
2,AVERY IS MUCH BETTER,PAPER WAS NOT BRILLIANT WHEN HEATPRESSED. AVERY IS THE BESTI HAVE USED SO FAR...
3,Good but expensive power supply,"Easy to use and great shots. Be aware that you will need to add more money for the AC Power Adapter, otherwise you are always running on batteries, that do not last long..."
2,Average performer at a premium price,"I'm not 12 yr old, but its the only way I could write the review without the hassle of registering. Sorry. :-)ProsGood design and interfaceExcellent outdoors performance (then again, most cameras are)ConsEats batteries, even 1700 mAh Ni-Mh onesExposure performance is useless indoors and at night, limited by ISO 100/150 onlyThe [expensive] street prices don't justify the performanceI tried three other cameras that were capable ISO 400 exposures and the difference was literally night and day. With the flash on, the picture gets washed out (EV compensation is useless), with flash off, the A20 compensates by slowing shutter speed which results in blurry pics (unless you have a tripod or a rock steady hand).All-in-all, Canon has let me down...big time ! I sincerely expected better from Canon."
1,Another Leaking Lite Tank,"After finding that my Lite Tank was leaking I was forced to vent the propane, have it packaged, and return it before they would ship a replacement. Seems leaking is a more frequent occurrence than anyone would want."
5,Must Have Book For Your Shelf .Wonderful !,"This Is One Of The Great Book Which Can Change World Around You.He Touched every Aspect From Health To Love In this Book.In first chapters Author Gives us complete information on what is mind & how it works.How to Think & why ?How self hypnosys will help you to change your world.Speaking Clearly,He Says You Create Your World From Inside.Change Your Thought,Change Your World.A Very Practicle Book.Read It,You Wont Get Disapointed."
5,Herbs made simple!!!,"Dr. McCann has a way of making a difficult subject simple. I kept a copy of this book in my waiting room and not only could my patients not put it down, they all wanted to take it home with them. If you are looking for a simple, yet concise, understanding of the power of herbs this is the book for you."
1,"Jim, PLEEEEEEASE STOP!","As a true fan of Carrey's old movies I think I have the rigt to honestly say what I think about this one:The Good:1. Good Story.The Bad:1. Jim Carrey looks like he's at least 65 yrs old in this one. WHY?!2. Where is Ewan McGregor's character supposed to be from? He has four or more different accents!3. The kissing scenes were awful. I felt bad for Ewan.I think Jim Carrey should retire. Sadly it would be too late to do it with dignity.Good Luck, Jim!"
1,Not compatable,I was not able to watch the movie as it is in a format that is not compatable for Australian Television sets of for a DVD.
1,Made it to the one hour mark without a chuckle,At least La Cage aux Folles was funny. This is not. Just dumb. Not even dumber. Good thing it was only 99 cents.
1,Bad in every possible way,"This film was bad in every way.Not funny.Bizarre behaviour just for the heck of it ?Offensive if you are gay.Repulsive if you are straight.Ejected after 40 minutes with the thought ........ ""What was this supposed to be ?""Seems like it was just an exercise in seeing how weird they could make different scenes just to be weird."
1,What a shame!,This book is nothing more than tabloid trash. The author should be ashamed of himself.
5,who needs Blu-Ray with this?,"After using a first gen LG upconverting DVD player, I thought I'd try out this newer LG DN798 model that does full 1080p to use with my new LG 47"" LCD panel. Wow what a great combo! I had always settled for 720p up with my older Samsung 40"" LCD, which is pretty decent, but you can see that the LG likes the full 1080p and this player delivers. The price thru Amazon even with the second party sell thru was great and shipping nice and fast."
5,LG DVD Player,"Excellent quality and performance. Another great product from LG. Clear picture, great price!"
3,"Okay, but...","This hardware does its job adequately - my computer and keyboard are talking to each other. However, it is an extra hassle to deal with the ""software you are installing has not passed Windows logo testing"" messages. Also, several times after unplugging the midisport from the computer, I've had to reinstall it the next time I wanted to use it rather than simply plug it back in - also a hassle. (The last few times I unplugged I did not have to reinstall, however.)I was looking for a budget MIDI interface, and this serves the purpose at a reasonable price if a person is willing to deal with a few hassles along the way."
2,Bible story gets shorted in this adaptation,"Aside from the less than best illustrations, the Joseph story itself in this telling takes second seat to the promotion of Bible reading today. The three main characters are not the Biblical characters but three modern figures. A female Biblical archaeologist, what may be her male assistant or colleague (he seems less knowledgeable), and a rather racistly portrayed side-kick in the form of a native Egyptian boy. Little time is spent on the Joseph story, most of it focuses on his role after assession to power and less on his reasons for being in Egypt or the lesson is story is supposed to teach."
5,tiger linament too! yahoo!,after being a tiger balm user for about 18 years i heard that there was a linament too. almost as good as the balm this is pretty goods stuff. i like to put a little into a hot bath and allow the linament to aeromatically open my sinuses. also very good for massages and muscle pulls and bruises.
5,a master at his wise best,Graham Greene writes reviews with the authority of someone who has actually written novels and films and his insights are more helpful than a dozen books on screenwriting.
3,Air Rifles Should Be Cleaned,"I've used Hoppes cleaning gear my whole life, they make good stuff, but for an air rifle(I have a Crosman 2100), this cleaning kit is overkill and way overpriced.The cleaning rod and the tip for a cleaning patch, maybe a few patches would be all you need in a kit like this. The only other thing you need is Hoppes #9 Gun Bore Cleaner and a bag of cleaning patches. Clean the bore, then lubricate the rifle with pellet gun oil. I use TriFlo on my air rifle. Plenty of internet debate on which oil you should use.The wire brush and #9 Lubricating Oil that come in this kit should not be used on an air rifle, they are only for use on firearms."
3,Rod was bent...,Be cautious! When I recieved this package in the mail one of the rods were bent. Overall its just a very simple kit that gets the job done.
3,Not very strong,"The rods with this kit fit in the bore well, but unless you twist the cleaning rod in the barrel, it will bend. I thought due to the company it would be better. I will not buy this product again."
4,Good kit,Bought this for a small game .177. The kit is good for the price. No complaints. I would recommend it.
3,Basic kit,"This is a pretty basic cleaning kit.It'll do what you need.If you need a cheap kit, this will do."
2,Be sure to take away once outer cover is breached.,"My dog enjoyed this toy - TOO much. It was fun until the outer cover was breached. It was apparently filled with rope scraps of a size EASILY ingested. Additionally, the outer cover unraveled into extremely LONG and apparently easily consumed sections. Long story short: this toy cost me $3K in surgery costs to remove ingested sections from her intestines and cost my dog extreme misery. It is a fine toy ONLY if enjoyed under CONSTANT monitoring (mine ate hers at night, so take it up in the evening if you purchase one). BTW: the toy only lasted one month before breach. We have had several tough soft stuffed toys that have lasted two years and are not yet breached. They were more expensive, but definitely worth the money. (I have two Golden Retrievers, for reference on the dog type. The impacted dog was 5 years old - not a puppy.)"
4,X-Factor is a good album!!,It's sure Blaze wasn't replace bruce but they are some graet songon this album like Sign of the Cross or Lord of the flies
1,Fake,"I didn't want to write a review on this piece of garbage, because I didn't want anyone to know I was suckered in to buying this. Its a F A K E video, and the whole movie stinks. BANNED, ya! right for false advertising. Don't even bother to rent this. You won't miss the dollar rental as much as your lost time. Not even good enough to fast forward to check out the SKANKS rape seen. (fake of course). I keep disks like this for summer, and add them in to my skeet supplies. I get a very satisfying smile on my face every time one of these silvery disk flies into hundreds of pieces when shot by a 12 gauge shotgun. PS 4 stars must be new to horror films. Or has a financial interest in this stinker. What he tells you about the movie is correct enough. His thin white girl, is a 2 am skank, and you are wondering crab's? or clap? And am I really drunk enough, and do I have some extra strong condums."
1,Not a good book for beginners,"This is not a good book for Java beginners. I would recommend looking at some other book if your going to try and learn Java for the very first time. The book hops around on topics, does not present the information in a simple or straight forward way.I would recommend looking for a different book if you are new to Java."
3,Mixed feelings,This review is based on the first 5 chapters only - the rating might prove unfair.The writing is fine and if you want to learn the basics of Java and object oriented programming I'm sure you'll eventually reach the goal even if there are plenty of detours on the way.But two things baffle me: Firstly Horstmann assumes that the reader doesn't know the first thing about computers. This leads to many totally unnecesary explanations. No computer novice would ever consider picking up a book on Java.Secondly Horstmann is a math enthusiast. Too many of the examples and exersises are of the calculator type. Seriously if I want to add two integers I'll use my pocket calculator - I don't think I'll need to write a Java programme. It would be good with more useful examples.The book is not bad though. Horstmann just needs to focus on the OO and the Java and forget about the rest.
4,"Careful, it melts plastic","Use on metal, NOT PLASTIC! It will dissolve plastic quickly. Good for a leatherman. Bad for a swiss army knife. It did major cosmetic damage to the plastic handles! Guess I should have seen that coming. I wish it said this more clearly on the bottle.As a lubricant it works pretty well."
4,A hilarious satire.,"This book is a commentary on the deplorable condition of public schools and the complete ignorance and vinictiveness of the Teachers, only put in exaggerated terms of full scale war. Very funny, very well written."
5,Great Product- finally!,"I have found that by using the Wen cleanser, I can usually get away with not using product at all. This works great, though so I can feel more confident that frizz will be kept under control and it smells good, too. My hair is colored, kind of think and is wavy in ALL the wrong places, so I blow it out. My hair is so much more manageable and shiny!"
1,Don't even bother if you use a Mac,"I purchased the 2003 version of this for the Macintosh. It was slowish, but worked, until I upgraded to the next level of OSX, which brought the encyclopedia to a halt. A very nice person at Britannica told me that they were aware of the problem, that it was unfixable for the 2003 version, but all would be ship shape and right as rain in the 2004 upgrade. Amazingly, I fell for it and shelled out more money (I really wanted this thing to work!) Again, it functioned acceptably at first, but as soon as I went to another upgrade of the Mac OS, it was all over.I won't comment on the content because I can't see it.If there is a class action suit against these limey bastards, please let me know!!!"
5,A world of complete knowledge,"My father bought me the Encyclopaedia Briannica 2006, ultimate reference suite. When I install it on my computer, I became extremely happy because it contains everything I needed. It help me to do a lot of projects and home works. It is good for students like me. Really it is a world of knowledge. It's new videos, images, content etc. are very usefull. So I say that everyone should buy this for you and your child. It will help you to know everything in the world. Before buying this I have the Encyclopaedia Britannica 2003, deluxe edition. When comparing these two, The level of 2006, ultimate reference suite is very high. It is little slow, but it is not a problem when compared to the content inside it."
1,poorly constructed bulb,"CFA Trading INC provided fast delivery and a well package product. the problem is the bulbs themselves. Out of 5 bulbs ordered, one didn't work and one came apart as it was screwed in the socket. Needless to say, Sylvania has questionable products."
2,So Bummed Out,Count me as another teen girl who is bummed out that she spent her money on this book. It took only about an hour to read and I think that some of the books in the Love Stories series are better written and more interesting. The thing that bothered me the most is that the author obviously tried so hard to write funny and quirky characters that they ended up unbelievable.
2,Not Very Good,"I was so disappointed by the book, because I spent my allowance money to buy it instead of getting it at the librray and I love the author alot. But this book about the prom felt like one of those cheesy paperback books that my big sister gave me that she used to collect. The characters are either not developed or totally unbelievable, and there is stuff in this book that is meant to be funny but just isn't. I heard this book is getting good reviews but I don't understand why. I am thirteen years old, so this book should be perfect for me. But is isn't."
5,performance of Stravinsky Petrouchka,"The Stravinsky Petrouchka and Rite of Spring for two pianos are powerful works and an equally powerfulperformance in this recording. After hearing this recording, I would certainly choose the two piano versionover the finished orchestral one. It is as satisfying as listening to a fine performance of Bach's Art Of The Fugue."
5,Amelia Bedelia in show business? What could possibly go wrong?,"Amelia Bedelia is going to help out in an orchestra, and a chorus of laughter is sure to result!In her usual fashion, our wonderfully confused friend is on the job, messing things all up with the finest of intentions. The cheerful illustrations add to the young readers's fascination with Bravo, Amelia Bedelia!Recommended!"
2,Interesting but a little sad,"I'm very fond of ""At The Save-A-Penny Super Store"", even though the lyrics were probably already dated when the song was released - it sounds like they put a lot of work into it and had a lot of fun with it. Must have been disappointing when it didn't go anywhere. The rest of this collection for me is more interesting as historical footnote, rather than as intrinsically entertaining. There are tentative feints in various directions - a folk riff here, a bluesy run there, a bit of Al Caiola sound-alike, plus too many glacial ballads for my taste - but they don't stray far from their roots, and the results are curious and maybe a little sad. Recommended for fans and those who have heard ""How High the Moon"" too many times, and want to know what else there is."
2,"Too Much Geraldine, Not Enough of Glenn Ford!","Glenn Ford does his usual fine performance; however, Geraldine Page takes up most of the screen time as the ditzy old maid. Very confusing plot. Not enough of Mr. Glenn Ford. END"
5,Love It,"The first time I saw this movie, I loved it; Of course, Ms Page is good; the best, but I think portraying a middle aged postmistress at her annual postal convention and meeting a travelling salesman may just change things for her; Ok, you have this sweet,little middle aged lady(Geraldine Page), who is in NYC for her annual Postal Convention, and she happens to meet Glenn Ford, who unfortunately is up there to meet up with his fiancee(Angela Lansbury)and son, and finding out that things are not as cracked up as they can be; One of the sweetest scenes in the movie is where Page and Ford are waiting for a room and looking out the window, and somehow, they end up kissing; so romantic; a nice sleeper of a film that's cute and enjoyable;"
3,it's okay.,"i liked the movie because lauren hays is in it. that the reason why i bought it. however you are better off just renting it if you can or borrowing it from a friend. i like the fact that it was basically an all girl adventure.(that's just me.) and inspite of the fact that it's soft porn i apprieciate the fact the makers of the film tried to make it look like a bigger picture than it actually was, they had good imagination. they worked very hard on it - i could tell. and even though it is not a really good movie i think they did a really good effort. i'll say this about it. it was trying to be a takeoff of the tomb raider flicks, and at that i think they were much more better than the real thing, at least they tried to tell a story. so i guess i recommend it. but i got it because of lauren hays and i could really give a rats ass about the rest. i leave it up to the personal taste of others to decide."
1,This Camera ...!,I bought the fugifilm 6800 zoom [and] It broke a week and a half later. I sent it in to be repaired and haven't seen it since. ... I've made several calls and wrote emails...no one cares to get back to me. Fugi's customer service works as well as my new digital camera. So anyone lookin to buy this piece of ... designed by porche...be CAREFUL! It's a lot of money to throw away.
4,New Fujifilm camera,"This super CCD is much better on old CCD. I have fuji 1.5M pix before, this one is much much better. This one is just released in this feb. This one can record video and sound for 30 second. Price is still expensive for students, but it's a new stuffs. Looks cool!"
5,"GREAT ""SMALL"" DIGITAL CAMERA","I bought this Fuji Finepix 6800 the same day that I bought my new Sony DSC-S85 (4.1) Digital Camera. I've tried them in side-by-side comparison shots, they BOTH take great pictures. I love this Fuji for the portability and FAST boot-up. The Sony is great for the ability to use add-on lenses for adding flexibility on picture taking. I would recommend this Fuji for anyone looking for a small, easy to use digital camera."
3,Perfect for occasional use / Great Value,"Pros:- Small and portable.- Flawless fax with standard paper in ADF- Low Cost (can't beat the price)- Good Print quality in normal-fast mode- Scan Quality is good when using flatbed or ADF with standard paper- Prints very fast over network interface / reduces processor usage on client computer- Auto calibration / Feed detection photo sensor (this feature makes HP ink-jet printers shine!!)Cons:- Slow printing / copying speed- Scanning over the network requires you to install 300mb+ bloatware, and it pegs the printers onboard CPU (no-coprocessor to handle TCP/IP stack?) causing it to run at about 1/5 the speed of the USB connection.- ADF can only feed standard paper, anything else is an epic failure- Memory card reader not reading larger CF cards (1GB or larger)- Ink cartridges are tiny / not for office use- Not as well built as my photosmart / flimsy paper tray"
1,"Unreliable, slow, expensive to operate",This is a pretty dreadful product. I have had a number of HP printers and loved them all up to now. I have a 5 year old HP laser printer that is the best printer I have ever had. This is the worst. Copying is slower than grass growing. The cartridges run out after just a few pages and are expensive to replace. The printer jams easily and jams are hard to remove. After a jam is removed it often requires power off and on to get the printer working again. The multiple page document feeder is pretty good. That and fact it is quiet is about all I say good about the 6310.
3,Not quite ready for Mac Leopard,"The HP Officejet 6310 All-in-One is a standard Copy, Scan, Print and fax machine -- adequate for all those purposes. However, don't buy this just yet if you are running Leopard (OS 10.5) on your Mac. You may print and copy, but Scan is not recognized. I alerted HP to this right after Thanksgiving, 2007, and was told by the online tech rep they are ""tirelessly working on it."" No time horizon was given for this, but I don't expect a remedy before January."
2,Not worth it.,"This thing stinks. Our manager bought this AIO because we were loosing the Recoh that we are using. The only good thing I can say is that it prints fast. The software will not install if you don't choose to install all of the other garbage-ware. Opt-ing out just causes the installer to run veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slowly (I gave up after waiting 3 hours). The scanner does not work at all over network connections. And there is no Opt-out to use the fax. We don't have any land lines here, but I still had to enter a number (I entered zeros and it seemed satisfied. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID."
1,HP 6310 is a dog,"I cannot believe what a dog of a printer the HP 6310 is. It frequently rejects HP brand ink cartidges as being ""not intended for this printer,"" the paper rollers often jam and stick, and the lids don't close properly making it necessary to ""jimmy"" the lids in order to get the f.ing thing to work at all. This thing is HP junk. Don't waste your money on this thing. It would be better used as a boat anchor."
4,Good Function but Windows OS issues,"HP Officejet 6310 All-in-One PrinterPrinter is easy to install. Print color excellent, scanner works well. Installing adds printer as a storage device to bios and when your computer boots up it can't find the main boot up drive. You have to either be sure the printer is off when you boot up or change your bios back to its original configuration."
2,"the product is not as expect, but amazon issued full refund","What can I say? Amazon has the best customer service ever. I bought the HP printer and test print it, I inserted the inks and use the photo paper comes with it to test print. It was way too slow. And I request a refund, I thought I'd lose money on the shipping and they will only issue partial refund. But, after I called the customer service and told them my situation, (opened item is not eligible for a full refund), they said they will pay for the shipping cost and issue full refund. I don't get or lose anything for the transaction, Base on the experence with amazon, I'd definately come back again."
1,Smashed it like Office Space,I barely used it for about a year and then it started giving me a paper jam warning when there was no paper. Then it starting having the blinking camera light - which means it is toast. HP customer support would not replace it because I missed the warranty by 1 week. The store would not take it back either so I threw it about 20 ft and beat it with a crow bar and baseball bat. Thanks HP!
4,Great printer for the price,This is a great little printer for the price. I have a laptop hooked up as well as a desktop and the printer is great for both. I am very pleased with my purchase
2,Off the mark,"I bought this printer about two years ago and was very excited about the list of cool features. 4 hours after plugging it in I got off the phone with tech support. Turns out the networking doesn't play well with windows firewall. I never did get it to scan as designed-it worked if I initiated the scan from the PC, but not from the printer. It finally gave up the fight and I got the same failure as so many others I have read about. All the lights start blinking and it says ""Reset Power"". The best I can tell, that means throw it away and go buy a Canon. While you never like it when a product dies prematurely, I can't complain about its print quality, faxing, or copying. Only that it didn't do any of those functions for very long. Oh yeah, if you are looking at HP products, check out the driver size. This one took up over 700MB. Yes, It is almost as large as the full Windows XP install. And it was a total memory pig."
4,rolling on the river,This was purchased for personal use. It was very easy to set up and thus far has provided good service. Delivery was quick. Copying is a bit slow which prevents me from awarding 5 stars.
5,Excellent all in one!!!,The best product all in one for printing scanning and more. Even to intruduce the all types of memory cards.Thxs
1,worst printer ever,"The software would not install on vista x64. Wasted 4 hours on the phone with HP trying to install it. On my other computer running xp, software installed but would crash 90% of the time after windows starts up. Uninstall doesn't even work right, I'm not sure what it uninstalled, still had all the hp services running and most of the shortcuts and program files after uninstalling."
1,Avoid this printer!,"This is one of the worst printers I have ever had the misfortune to buy.1) The installer executables are HUGE and the installation process takes FOREVER.2) Typical shoddy HP software runs as if it's spyware. Multiple processes run as daemons and often consume huge amounts of CPU, and they also often will not shut down properly.3) I bought it for its networking capability, BUT ... If your router is power-cycled then the printer must also be power-cycled, and quite often, pressing the power button does nothing, and I have to unplug it from the wall.4) Many of the advanced networking features just plain don't work (probably because of the shoddy HP software on the workstation end).5) It has a sheet feeder but often fails to correctly feed sheets.I could go on, but you get the point. Choose a better printer."
5,LOVE IT!!,"My company gave me one of these printers for my ""at home"" printing work. I loved it so much I purchased one for my personal use. I have 2 of these printers and I think they are great!!! No problems at all with either one. The work one I have had for 2 years or more and it still is running fine. Best of all I think it only cost me about $60, on sale!!"
1,"More HP junk, pure and simple","Just like the 6210, this has the dreaded ""carriage jam"" issue, which means you should avoid it like the PLAGUE. HP has become terrible when it comes to printers, and you'd be better off lopping your fingers off and writing your documents up with all the spraying blood seeing as it would be less painful than dealing with either the 62/6310 series.Save yourself the infinite grief and just avoid at all costs. You have been warned."
2,"Ok printer, but not all functions work with Vista",You can not use the scan function with Vista. You have to open Paint software and scan from within it. Very time consuming and had I known I would not have purchased this printer. I am using a HP Computer and this is a HP printer. You would think they would be compatible. Shame on HP for putting out an inferior printer. I expect more from them.
5,Excellent Episode That Sends Chills,....It's a television show designed to entertain. I loved this epsiode due to its suspense. The crew of the Enterprise slowly turns into different creatures due to a drug administered into Lt. Barclay. The thing that makes it exciting is that you don't know whats going to happen next and you don't know what everyone is going to turn into. Wipe the science of things out of your head and watch a classic such as this. .... 5 stars all the way.
3,Photo Album,"Liked the album very much,not one of those cling thing's.I have a lot of photo's that were here and their and needed a photo album like this"
1,not a very good product,The quality of this item is not upto my expectation. Bed cover is not at all covering the queens bed completely. I guess i made a mistake of buying this product.
4,"nice, especially for the price","i really like the comforter set. only problem i have is it fits like a full size comforter and i have a queen size bed. but for the money, i love it."
4,Great toy but had to find the right bulb,You have to get a bulb for this so be sure to measure first. I got the first ones too long.
2,Creepy Crawler Bummer,"This was a gift for my daughter at Christmas. SO exciting! Of course, she had to wait til we got a bulb. Now - we're finally getting ready to make some bugs, when, guess what? The ""On/Off"" switch won't stay ""On"". ARGH! We've tossed the packaging in our post holiday haste, and now have a toy with tons of the refill goop, that doesn't work. Not happy at all. Anyone else have this experience with the power switch?"
4,My kids LOVE this! Need more goop!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and all four of my kids love it. They've used up all the ""goop"" and we have a pile of creepy-crawlies which they are having lots of fun with. It's easy and the results are really impressive. I didn't think the lack of a light bulb was a big deal. So, the kids had to wait a day for dad to pick up a bulb. Whatever. It was worth the wait. The kit really is neat. Kids love creating things and little boys are wow-ed by the nifty results. Very creepy little critters. I'm here on Amazon shopping for some refills so the kids can continue their fun."
2,No hero with this guitar,"I purchased this for my daughter, she is 9. I thought that it would help her to actually learn to play the guitar, where games like Guitar Hero don't. This is pretty much a Guitar Hero game with out the great graphics and games that come along with it.My toddler had fun pushing the buttons, and it has held up well through him trying to play a ""real"" guitar like his big brother. But that alone wasn't worth what I paid for it."
2,Never became a fan,"My daughters found this very difficult and boring to learn. Played with it for a few hours, gave up, never touched it again."
4,An unforgettable story of love's staying power,"I approached this book with much excitement and it did not disappoint. It is not only a chronicle of an undying, yet impossible love but it also presents a crisp picture of 18th century Venice with all its charm and outdated aristocracy. The book is so bittersweet...in spite of the pureness and greatness of their love it is so heart-wrenching to see them forced to live separate lives by an inflexible and archaic social system. Maybe they have found themselves again in a subsequent life and have had the chance to be together and fulfill their interrupted love story."
1,Teenage Angst,"I read a review of the book in a magazine and had my local bookstore order it for me. My eager anticipation was not satisfied. Far from seeming to be a passionate, once-in-a-lifetime love affair, Giustiniana's and Andrea's letters sounded more like the overly dramatic notes of two 13-year olds, particularly hers. Who wants to read a teeny-bopper's exaggerated yearnings and longings, except perhaps another teeny-bopper? The portraits of the different cultures were very interesting, but not enough to offset wading through those tiresome letters. I finished the book only because I wanted to learn what became of the pair. I'm hosting our book club in May and was going to pick this book for our selection -- until I read it."
4,pretty good book,"I haven't finished the book, however I am about half way through. It does contain a lot of information. I do like the real people stories. It does seem to repeat itself a lot. I think the same information could have been organized better or condensed somewhat. There are many books out there and I would read as much as I can if you are interested in becoming a powerseller so yes I would recommend this book. Plus, you can read it online too."
3,Somewhat Disappointing...,"It was nothing more than a do-don't ""myth"" listing and I guess I expected more. It is good material but there are other much better books out there like ""eBay Millionaire"" by Amy Joyner, which is highly recommended. I didn't feel ripped off but I didn't get much out of this book either."
3,A good book for a begginer,"A well written book that proves quite basic in most aspects for someone with even short eBay experience. Quite a few good hints and tips but found that it contains a lot of basic eBay information that does not, in my opinion, belong in a book about power seller secrets, which basically denotes that you are past basic eBay experience, past seller, and even past power seller as you'll be learning secrets for power sellers.I expected to be taught more as a power seller, and a new one at that. It left me a bit short of my expectations."
3,Don't be fooled....,"...into thinking that Bram Stoker is the main character of this book. Even though his name is mentioned on nearly every page and his influence is seen throughout, Bram Stoker is merely the hook used to reel you in.In Moon Rising, Roberts details (almost painfully, at times) the life of Damaris Stearne. Her thorough description of places and people made this book longer than need be. But Roberts enabled me to really understand her characters, which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 2.The story, while entertaining, is highly improbable. Since I don't want to give too much away, I'll just say this: the adventures of Damaris are enough for three lifetimes and she is probably the luckiest person this earth has known. So, if you are to read Moon Rising, put away your expectations of historical ficton (which, for me, is to actually *learn* something), turn off your brain and just enjoy the ride."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Overall, I agree with the St. Paul reviewer above--some of this stuff is fairly extreme, and while most of it is reasonably well-written, quite a few of the stories lack broader appeal, cf. the threesome with a girl's live girlfriend and her dead ex, as well as a couple of bizarre sequences that I'm not sure fit the genre. Variety is always nice, especially when it comes to sex, and even more especially when you're just reading it and not participating. But this anthology tries to cover too many bases at once, which will probably make it a disappointment for most readers. Almost everyone will find three or four stories to love, but then there are the other three hundred pages."
2,midiman 2x2,this product is great the only problem I have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item I get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an Id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer. I want to use this item but I am afraid to please verify you certificate so I can complete my download
5,good MMX game i've seen in a while,"great improvement in both storyline and in-game cinemas. english voice-acting sounds good and actually matches their characters. there's also interesting things you can collect for fun like pictures for your ""room"" in the game. even the new female reploids get more of a background and personality enough to become memorable characters=)"
5,Bodum Coffee Pot,We love this french press coffee maker. It's a 12 pot which looks big when you take it out of the box and is great when you make coffee and want multiple cups. The coffee is delicious! It won't stay warm long in this french press so we just drink it up.
5,French Press,"This French Press makes a great cup of coffee! A smaller one would be better for just one or two servings, though."
5,Wonderful,"I switched from a Bunn coffee maker to this french press. Paired with a burr coffee grinder, you cannot go wrong! Coffee now tastes as good as (or better than) any I can get at the best restaurants and coffee shops."
2,Good price - bad movie,"Amazon had the best price and speediest delivery. Was very disappointed in the movie. They did a great job with the advertising and trailers, but the movie sucked."
5,Great Movie!,Inception is a great movie that is well-written with lots of action. One that can be watched more than once! Thought-provoking and great effects. Acting superb by all.
4,"One cute idea, not too original execution","May contain spoiler.Inception has one cute idea, just like Memento has one cute idea, not much else. The execution is decent but nothing earth shuttering. There are so many scenes reminiscent of Dark City and the Matrix. The last scene on the plane reminds me of the last of Donnie Darko, only less potent.Most of the action scenes are pretty much run of the mills. And the big reveal (involving the heir and his father) is woefully anticlimactic. The characters lack the ""cool"" factor like in the Matrix. And what the hell was Ellen Page wearing?"
5,One of the best movies of the year,"One of the best movies of the year. Original, thought provoking, and worthy of turning your phone off for two and a half hours. Hans Zimmer's music score is superb (when has it not?) and Christopher Nolan establishes himself as a superb director in this fast paced thriller. The last few seconds you need to keep watching and if you did not catch it, watch the movie a second time."
3,Inception Exception,"The 2010 film ""Inception"" is filled with great photography and clever camera tricks. If there were anything about the characters or story that I cared about, I'm certain I would like it more."
3,Overrated.,"This film is an overly ambitious, convoluted mess with a clever baseline concept and clever thread at the end that manages to kind of tie things back together. I really wish the story had been executed a bit better and had stayed within the bounds of its own self-defined reality. Overall, it is worth seeing, but not worth all the hype that it received."
5,One of the best,This film is a modern masterpiece. How does one brain write and direct such rich content? I cannot imagine the hours spent nutting this one out. The film gives me great hope that Hollywood is capable of producing films of complexity and depth.
2,Confusing,"My wife and I found this confusing. Who is sleeping, who is awake, to many levels of indirection. If you can keep the ""who is who right now"" straight , it could be a decent movie."
2,"Sorry, folks...","Just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough for this one... I kept wondering if any of it was actually plausible, even within the universe the movie was creating. The Prestige is a much better Christopher Nolan film, and of course the Batman movies."
2,Hollywood Has An Idea,"Hollywood has an idea, and it wants to plant it in your mind.The movie's initial special effects (turning Paris upside down) lead you to believe the whole movie will score high on the WOW factor, but the 2nd half of the flick is just a good-guys-vs-the-bad-guys shoot-'em-up, played out in different locales and in different layers of dream.Like all Hollywood lowbrow flicks (which is to say, like every Hollywood movie), the bad guys shoot millions of bullets but hit only one of the good guys. The good guys take better aim and kill off dozens of the bad guys. This is such a tired and unrealistic idea.Nonetheless, many movie goers rate this as an exciting product."
2,Crazy Movie,"Well i am a 54 year old male. I've seen lots of movies.I just watched this Inception movie but it is kind of hard to understand. It is weird in fact. All shooter upper and no sense. It tries to be like the matrix, but its not. It is way more crazy and senseless. Various levels of dreams and dreamscapes, people flying everywhere,and everyone killing someone. Good special effects at times, but all in all, a big waste. Trying to make sense out of dreams which is senseless and pointless in this movie. I paid 3.99 to rent it ok, you got me. But I did not watch it all at one time. I had to pause a day because it got so stupid and i needed a break from this action scene after scene with the same boring actions and sound track. I will not watch this movie again and i don't recommend it unless you want a big headache. If this is the directors mind, then he should be seeing a psychiatrist."
4,Serious dreamers only!!,If you take the dream realm seriously then this is for you. I've watched it many times and look forward to many more viewings. It's where your mind goes when you go to sleep.
2,Boring,"I am giving this 2 stars because I actually have only watched part of the movie. I can't get through the entire movie because it puts me to sleep!!! I patiently waited until Netflix was able to provide it (45 days later than the release) and was very excited to finally get it. However, when I try to watch it, I get so bored, I fall asleep. I'll try again and if I fail again, I'll just return the movie and get something that makes more sense."
4,Wow,This is a very complex movie. The subject matter or concept of the movie however is excellent. You've got to stay with it and sometimes a review of material is required.
2,"DVD delivered on time, in good condition.",I was told this was the best movie out in the last ten years. I found it long and drawn-out. It was a real snooze fest!
4,Interesting Flick,"Most movies these days bore me to tears because the scripts are banal. Inception is an exception to the rule. I can see where some people might get confused by the multilevel dream thread, but I think the editor did a good job reminding us of the original and subordinate dreams. If you can, or better yet want, to keep up with it all then this is a fun ride. I'll agree with the critique that it is too darn long. A one star hit from me because I think thirty minutes should have been edited out. That said, I can see where the filmmakers maybe cleverly wanted to pull the audience into the effect of the exponential increase in time for each dream level. Honestly it didn't feel like 2.5 hours to me, but my wife said it did to her. This is a very unique movie and I enjoyed it thoroughly...a rarity in these times of cookie-cutter formula movies. Bottom line: highly recommended."
2,"I get it, I just don't like it","Frankly I don't understand a lot of the ""I didn't get it"" reviews. It seemed pretty straight forward to me, but then maybe I've seen the Matrix too many times.This just did nothing for me at all, I mean how many times has this ""are we in a dream or reality"" shtick been done and re-done and re-done? Oh, I know! Let's put a spin on it and say ""Is it a dream or a dream or a dream or reality"". Give me a break.I didn't hate it by any means at all, in fact I think the hotel fight scene was one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, but I left the theater thinking ""I don't get it"" not for the plot but for why so many people loved this movie in the first place."
5,Great Movie!,I don't understand why this movie lost the best movie Oscar to The King's Speech! Beside that the blu- ray image quality os astonishing!
3,Makes me mad! [Not a Review],"I usually don't do this, using space for a review to just comment, but I really just want to get this off of my chest.This really irks that crap outta me! I mean, why in the world is there not a reasonably priced ""Inception Limited Edition Briefcase"" for the States?! How is it fair that nearly everywhere else in the world gets one, but the US doesn't get 'em (I know it was initially also released in the States, I'm just talking about here on amazon) Anyway, the peeps at Warner Bros. really need to consider re-releasing this set, not only here in the States, but elsewhere also, for a REASONABLE price. I want one, dang it!"
1,Don't Pass Go: Awful Blu-Ray Authoring,"Can't skip through previews. Takes 5-7 minutes to get through them with 100 clicks of the fast-forward button. 'Next chapter' and 'disc menu' buttons were locked out. Sound mixing is bad, as I needed to constantly adjust volume. Dialog was whisper quiet, yet explosions and other action were thunderously loud. Then there's the HDCP that prevented playing on my home theater computer using PowerDVD Ultra. Played for a while on our Sony player with surround sound, but it was next to impossible to hear what was being said. I could only stand 15 minutes before giving up. Thank goodness it was a rental. It might have been a good movie, but the restricted user operations and the sound mixing completely ruined it for me. No wonder people copy these things, as many legal copies are ruined by how the discs are authored. No sympathy for the MPAA until you can just pop a disc in and play it immediately. I would not pay $5 for this."
3,Nothing but eye-candy and babble,"Babble - nonsensical dialog - whatever you call it' this movie has more than you'll find elsewhere. Little makes sense - dream in a dream in a dream? Sounds like an idea derived after a weekend of recreational drug use. ""Dude - I had a dream I was dreaming!"" ""Cool - let's make a movie.""Basically this was an excuse to show off special effects. The idea of being trapped in a dream - and not knowing it - is old hat. Nothing to see here. Move along. So what we have is an unoriginal plot (dream in dream) using another idea stolen from the movie ""Dreamscape"" (enter a dream to gather information or change the dreamer's real-life actions) with a bunch of B-list actors.Just because the end is intentionally hazy does not make this a ""great"" movie or a ""mind bender"" - it makes this a poorly executed rip-off from several other movies."
2,entertaining but not innovative at all,Found the story line to be a rehash of a frequently explored scifi/fantasy theme without much new to add. Rumors of ungodly complexity were overstated. Found it easy to follow
2,Another simple movie.,"Other than the special effects, this movie is kind of boring. The actors were not very convening. There is nothing new about industrial sabotage or even a dream with in a dream. The only complicated thing about the movie is keeping track of the layers of the dream. This is not that hard as each dream layer is very different from the one before.I see no reason why the movie is as popular as it is. Must be good advertising.The movie is okay but I'll not waste my time watching it again."
2,The IncepTrix,"I feel I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't try to compete in depth and in scope with all of the other current excellent reviews. So I'll go in the opposite direction and keep my review short and to the point.If you're a fan of the original Matrix, you'll either view this movie in one of two ways -1. as a nostalgic echo to that mind-trip you experienced the first time you saw the Matrix in 1999, with some new twists and turns and razzle-dazzle FX2. as a cheap rip-off of the quite solid Matrix story, now turned slightly convoluted... with fx thrown in to try and prop up the weaker storylineI would say I fall into camp 2.While I enjoyed the ride as it was going, it was quite forgettable after.Heck, even the poster is a rip on the Matrix. You have the whole crew, holding guns, with a steel blue backdrop. Replace backdrop with a steel blue cityscape and you have Inception."
1,disappointed,"I was really excited about this movie because I had just finished watching Shutter Island in which I loved! However, I couldn't even give this a full run. I was lost in the first half hour, not lost that I didn't know what was happening, It just couldn't hold my attention. I began reading a book, which you can't do while watching this movie. Finally, about 45 minutes into the movie, I just turned it off. This was rediculous. Worst movie I've tried to watch in a long time. I'd rather watch SpongeBob with my kids!!!!"
2,Who dreams like this?,"Mr. Nolan seems to like puzzles. A lot. Just take a look at The Following or Momento.With Inception, I think he tried to create the mother of all puzzles. Dreams within dreams within dreams and yes, within dreams. My complaint is, who dreams like this? If Leo and his crew joined my slumbers, they could share with me a race to a job I don't even have, an odd chat with my deceased aunt, a hike in the woods that transforms itself into a hotel lobby and of course, being naked when you don't want to be. All in no special order.Mr. Nolan's dream worlds are more like parallel realities, each with a very crisp narrative and very specific physical environment (and populated by armies of unnecessary bad guys.) They aren't dreamy. They're Matrixy.Watching Inception is like watching Mission Impossible, three James Bond movies, and What Dreams May Come all at the same time. It's exhausting."
4,Written AND directed by?,"This movie showcases the true talent Christopher Nolan posses. He wrote AND directed this movie which I find just amazing. The script was good and the story is mind bottling :) That being said, the movie is confusing and full of minor goofs. If you don't believe me, look at what IMDB has to say: [[...]] The movie was enjoyable and for once in a long time I feel I need to see it again. Highly recommended."
2,Convoluted tripe,"The director Nicholas Evans, sought a venue for his latest cyber-nanotechnological theory. Sadly unlike the Coen brothers, it wasn't rooted in solid physical concrete production design nor did it consider the viewers, innocent babes, seeing it for the first time. I'm a screenplay writer, with one optioned project, have watched movies non stop since age 9 with family and friends, lived and worked in NYC as a professional writer, but don't know how this got produced, unless Knob Leonardo deCaprio fronted most of the geld. Oh, whoops! Look at those credits! Here, let's throw in some car chase sequences, stern visaged close ups, home theme,,,,awwww.....guns......terse vacuous dialogue.....zippo emotional content because it is, Leonardo....sans the heart of a real lion. Save your money and go to the zoo."
5,REALLY REALLY GREAT FILM!,"first off this plot is one of the best of all time you can tell that it was well thought through before being put together for filming Nolan really did a great job with this one. the actors in this movie are very great too, ive been a big fan of Dicaprio since the Departed and am a fan of Page, Watanabe, and Gordon-Levitt as well also becoming a big fan of Hardy and cant wait to see some more of him in films. by far my favorite scene is the hotel fight scene that is a must see by far. this is a MUST SEE buy or rent just see the movie."
4,Great Movie,I saw this movie in the theater and had to have it for my collection. Every time I watch it I see new details. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good film.
4,better have blu-ray,"Great deal and couldn't pass up. But any true extras are blu-ray only, and that cool ""digital-copy"" is NOT HD either...bummer."
5,DiCap trikes again!,"DiCap is growing on me as an actor. Loved this one. He's been in some great ones as of late. Highly recommended. If you liked Matrix, I think you will like this."
4,Interesting concept,"This is one film that you cannot miss a minute of - can be confusing at times, unless you are paying close attention. (At least this was true for me, maybe not for someone else).I found the concept both fascinating and interesting, and in some instances, almost frightening. Definitely worth seeing. At last, something new brought to film, instead of reworking thesame old plots over and over."
4,A must have for the DVD collection!!,"I went to the show to go see this thinking that it would just be another run of the mill Sci-fi flick. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the original plot and beautiful cinematography put into the dream and fight sequences. I especially liked the ""dream within a dream"" concept. The acting was good, but Leo is in it so you know it would be. The supporting cast did a wonderful job as well. The only issue that I have about the film is that they didn't quite explain how they created the technology or the hardware to hack into an individuals dreams. However, I could have forgot something and this is the type of film that you watch a second time just to make sure there wasn't something you missed. I'm really hoping that they make a sequel for this, and I'm sure they will, because the movie ends in a cliffhanger. This is definitely going in the DVD collection when it comes out. 4 1/2 stars for me."
5,"Digital Copy expiration date for ""Inception""extended to 12/19/13!","This film in Blu-ray is dazzling and DON'T MISS OUT ON A ""FREE"" VIEWING OPTION! 2 disc Blu-ray, indeed, has 2 Blu-ray discs, plus a DVD disc, plus a Digital Copy insert that states in small lettering at the top ""DIGITAL COPY OFFER EXPIRES MAY 06, 2011."" Since I read earlier complaints about this 2011 expiration date, and since WB had repackaged this set without external reference to Digital Copy, I made purchase only for Blu-ray version of the film (at a great sale price). Was downloading Digital Copies from some other flicks, recalled the insert for ""Inception"" and being a knucklehead followed instructions for what I was sure would be mildly dispiriting psychic concussion. ""Oh my giant blue head!"" WB redeemed itself by extending the Digital Copy expiration date to 12/19/13! Not expecting such largesse, I am touched by this gesture ... and aching to believe a team of the previously disgruntled did an implantation to a honcho at WB!"
1,NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED,A BIG waste of money. DO NOT PAY EXTRA FOR DIGITAL COPY because WB will hose you! The customer service is terrible.
2,Least surreal dream movie ever,"Based on PRE FREUD dream theory (early 19th century) there is nothing dreamlike in this dreary, characterless, awful movie. Only redeeming feature is ariadne-- yes, I get the reference."
2,Not my preference.,"I wasn't impressed by the movie even though it is related to my profession. However, MANY love this flick and I bought as a gift for a good friend who appreciates the file. It was well done I must say, just ""wasn't feelin' it."""
5,Excelent!!!!,"What can I say??? One of the best movies of the year... Acting is excellent, sound's really good and the story is outstanding.... Cristopher Nolan is crazy!!!!! Love this kind of movies..."
1,Inception has a good concept but the concept wasn't transferable to the big screen,"Although a thought provoking concept the movie just didn't quite help the viewer take the concept further along. Disjointed, annoying and even the acting could not help this movie convey the concept. Not worth your time or brain cells."
1,Boring obscurantism,"This movie deserves a second star for its impressive special effects, but its convoluted and obscurantist plot negates the higher rating. The whole movie was just a vehicle for exhibiting the spectacle of a folding city. Inside a dream, are they dreaming, or are they dreaming about dreaming? Who gives a crap? Just plain boring silliness."
5,Thinking movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you think and has a lot of action in it. It might not all make 100 percent sense, but that is part of the movie. It makes you think and brings you into a different type of thinking. Is it the best movie ever made? No! IT is hard for this movie because there is a lot of hype in it. If you don't want to think and you get confused easily, I would stay away then from this movie. I enjoyed it and thought it was cool."
2,cardboard characters and sledgehammer special effects crush story,"Gamers and sci-fi nerds might like this one, but if you're looking for strong dialogue, believably motivated characters who one might care about or be interested in, and an artfully unfolded original story, run far away; this would be a two hour nightmare, like watching someone play a matrix video game. Special effects crap flying through the air and non-stop camera shots of ""cool"" model types continually shooting at each other borders on aggravating. An unsatisfying waste of time for anyone with half a brain."
1,BORING!!!!,"This movie is very overrated, and boring. My girlfriend fell asleep during the movie, which is very rare for her! I ended up staying up to watch the whole movie to see if I can get into it and it just flat out sucked! It was nothing fascinating to me about this movie! It was very dry and it just did not move me at all! Don't waste your money on this movie, I would suggest renting it!"
1,"OMGosh, this movie blows.","This movie is a perfect example of how easily the mindless viewing public can be duped into thinking they're watching something deep, meaningful and intelligent when if fact, it's nothing more than fluff. The Matrix movies were deeper, more meaningful, and weren't any more intelligent than your average episode of Wizards of Waverley Place. The acting is ok. I actually do really enjoy Leonardo's acting. The effects are shiny, but empty, like a toilet, but ultimately they're full of crap. I am obviously not a fan and I'm glad of it. Blah!"
4,Great movie,"I had seen this movie in theaters when it first came out and I fell in love with it! It kindof reminds me of A Beautiful Mind in a sense. Brilliant script, without a doubt!The only bad thing is that when I recieved the package, the bottom of the case had broken into a bunch of tiny pieces, but it looked like it wasnt done by the shipper itself, the postal guy probably banged it around a little, but movie worked great!"
5,This is how movies should be made of!,"For just under $20, you get the movie in Blue-ray, DVD, and in a digital copy to play on a computer. Plus, it includes a disc with many bonus features including the movie soundtrack, behind-the-scenes look at making the movie, a closer look at the study of dreams, and much more. This is a very good deal and a great movie all in a bundle!The movie itself was worth more than watching it once. It takes the some concepts of dreams, such as dreaming within a dream and killing yourself to wake up, and brings it out to a full length movie. But it's not a documentary, no worries! The plot involves a man and a team taking on a job where they must somehow convince a young man to not take on his father's legacy in controlling a company that controls half the worlds' energy supply. Of course, what better way to change someone's mind than to manipulate the people, places, and memories in a person's dream."
5,FRACTURING DREAMS,"INCEPTION is the best mind-bender to come along since Nolan's earlier work MEMENTO, and though it has elements that may remind some of that wonderful pic, DARK CITY, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, DREAMSCAPE, and even THE MATRIX, it is by no means a rehash of any of them. DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt, Watanabe, and Paige are all exceptional in the film, and their characters are a lot more provocative, and well-rounded than recent CGI-heavy films ( and, in fact, one of the best things about INCEPTION is that most of the action takes place on real sets, and not blue screen, ). I do think Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT was a slightly better film- but only by a nose, and I loved the fact that not everything is tied up in a nice little bow at the end of the movie. Lotsa' twisty fun."
5,For those who enjoy using their brains while watching movies,"I watched the movie in theaters twice because I loved it, and I preordered the Blueray which I just watched last night. Even after the third viewing and knowing the entire movie and probably most of the lines, I was still completely drawn in and could not help feeling the power of the story and the emotions. If you like the Matrix, you will very likely love this movie. Besides the mind-boggling layers of dreams, the story also progresses along a very personal and emotional journey, one that is ultimately driven by love. The soundtrack of the move is brilliant and probably one of my favorites, so make sure to turn up the volume of your surround sound system.Now, open your mind, open your heart, and let the dreams begin."
4,Great movie,I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. So many twists and a fairly new plot. Well worth seeing.
1,Incredibly Ridiculous convoluted plotless story line,"After all the high praise and top critic reviews I am shocked and disappointed to say that Inception has been added to my 'worse movies ever' list and is in first place. Twenty minutes into the movie I'm asking myself ""did I miss something"" I had no idea of what was going on. Disconnected mumble jumble scenes and dialogue and shoot'em up car crash scenes making for a cross between Wyatt Earp and Rambo. An utterly absurb movie that I couldn't finish watching. I'm happy to say I got a free streaming movie coupon so I didn't waste money on this nonsense but what a waste of a coupon."
5,CAPCOM Please Make a Sequel,"Capcom seems to be in a bit of a rut for the past few years.A Sequel to this game will do wonders for them (especially if it's motion controller enabled).The combat is unprecedented with only ""Bulletstorm"" coming close.Storyline is geat.Combat is great.Suspense is great.Story's Twist is great.Graphics are great (considering available technology then).This is a WINNER!"
4,get what you want,"this product is what it is said to be, it protects your ipod well. the screen cover on mine, the tape glue stuck to it and now it makes a virtual smudge on the screen. it also has some air bubbles on the screen but that is because i didnt put it on carefully. it also has a belt strap and a string that attaches to it. i have no idea what the string is for maybe to hang it from your neck? but it doesnt serve a very good use as far as i know. but it is a great price so if you dont want to spend much but you want to keep your ipod from looking like scrap metal then get this."
1,BRIGADOON! In space! Just throw 'em in the brig!,"Horrible, horrible, and horrible. A cheap rip-off of an arguably bad musical, the cast stretches absolutely no acting muscles in the dull tale of a mythical planet that appears every X-many years for absolutely no reason. The romantic subplot is EXTREMELY difficult to accept, especially given that it surrounds the station's science officer! Avoid at all costs."
1,If I could give it less than 1 star I would,"I was immensely disappointed by this recording. The tempi are entirely too fast and the parts are miscast. The recording itself sounds muddy, and I get better sound off my 40 yr. old turntable with the original LP on it."
5,Great Yearwood album.,"From 1992 this is Yearwood's second album, and one of her best.Four of these ten songs charted in country's top twenty.1. Wrong side of Memphis ~ 19922. Walkaway Joe ~ 19923. You say you will ~ 19934. Down on my knees ~ 1993My personal favorite, 'You say you will' ~ is here,and it's not found on her greatest hits C.D,which by the way neither is 'Down on my knees''Move two mountains' is another great song here.Over-all good country music."
5,Wonderfully original,"Mr. Hall's ingenious take on the Rubaiyat delights at every turn. Anyone remotely familiar with the original will want this book. Savor it a few pages at a time, and do NOT neglect the notes.William H. Hyde, Ph.D."
2,"Looks Kewl, but the menus are hard to navigate","I am a kid, but i dont want to use the kids review.M daddy got this fone for work so he let me fool around with it for a few minutes. I couldnt find how to change the ringtone or how to add an entry to the phone book. The menus arwe very hard to find things. The reason i rated it 3 stars is because it has a flash thingy for the camera and the outer screen is color so you can take pics with it. All u hav 2 do is wait for the camera toload and then close it. To take piks press the camera side button"
2,Samsung a670 not that great,"The phone gets heated too soon, about 20 mins of talk time is enough to get your chin heated up. Don't forget to get a hands free if you HAVE to buy this phone...."
5,I had this before the a650 then i had the a850,I used to have this phone and it was awesome i had it for ever it lasted beatdowns etc.Ringer Volume: 9.1/10 Could be louder but works outRinger Quality: 10/10 Doesnt miss a beatCall Hearing Volume: 9.1/10 Could be louderCall Hearing Quality: 10/10 PerfectKeypad: 9.9/10 Great but looks wierd. buttons are hugeScreen: 10/10 Big and colorfulExternal LCD: 10/10 ColorLooks: 9/10 Small but very plainCamera: 10/10 Far zoom and really good for the timeMenu UI: 9.4/10 Fast and easy but ringer for messages is wierd to changeBattery Life: 10/10 Just goes on and onDurability: 10/10 Takes a serious beatingFeatures: 10/10 Perfect for the priceReception: 9.7/10 Not as good as my a850.
2,Not worth the money,"My daughter and I both got this phone. Within 2 months, her display was totally distorted, and she couldn't see phone numbers or text messages, and of course couldn't see to take pictures. The time/date display on the front was intermittantly bad, too. As for mine, the battery would die within 2 days. It had to be recharged daily or by the middle of the second day, it would shut down for low battery. I don't think I'll try another Samsung, this was a bad experience."
1,Samsung phones break after 2 years,"I have purchased two Samsung phones in the past 5 years, and have had to replace each one after two years. The last Samsung phone I purchased, the Model SPH-N400, only two years ago in July, the flip on one arm broken off/separated from the hinge. WHen I called the warranty department about this issue, I was told that I would be responsible for getting this fixed, and it would cost be about $100+ dollars to fix the phone. What a joke when the value of the phone I bought 2 years ago was $134.99. I will never buy a Samsung phone again."
4,IT'S NOT THAT BAD!!!!,"I have had all the different wireless carriers and VERIZON has been the BEST. Yeah i have dropped the phone many times and had problems after that but i went right to Verizon and they gave me a new one. THERE IS A 1 YEAR WARRENTY ON THESE PHONES. after that, thats were you get the insurance and you won't have to pay for a brand new phone evertime something happens to it. Its only $4.99 a month. and for the Reception part it must be in your guys area cause were i live I NEVER EVER DROP CALLS and my friends say the same. Everyone says how clear my pictures come out and i am in my mid 20's so i talk on the phon all day long. my battery never dies. If you know anything about cell phones you should always charge your phone every night. I think all you other people are over exaggerating. LEARN HOW TO USE THE PHONE I BET YOU SEE THAT IT REALLY DOES WORK!!!"
1,Sound quality is poor.,"Tried my new phone for three weeks. I used it to call some cell phones, home phones from different carriers and services. The Sound is just not good.[...]"
3,Looking for furniture?,"Look on Ebay! They have SOME stuff, not much though. Ive been to WAL-MART and seen LOTS of SSC furniture..Maybe its just in different places.This house is cute but not much. The detailing is incredibly good and the whole Strawberry-shaped house is adorable. I love scented SSC stuff! Its pretty good quality. Fun for all ages!Megan-12"
3,Last made version was better,"The one I bought for my daughter 2 years ago is so much sturdier. Also came with more pieces. This one is flimsy but she still loves and uses it. Seems like Bandai's Strawberry shortcake items have gone downhill! This house, the filly stable and the castle are pretty much garbage. Only thing that saves them is their cuteness and kid appeal."
2,"Good, but there are better..","When I first recieved this CD, the first thing which struck me was how cheap it seemed - as though MCA had just thrown it together on the cheap and the words ""This Compact Disc contains programes transferred from anologue tape and therefore may contain some tape hiss"" ( wasen't CD meant to eliminate this? ) said it all for me. Being English and with Belinda continuing with her successful career all over Europe when the US forget her, I think you'd be better off with ""A Place On Earth"", a lavish and expensive looking album from a country where she is still a major star."
4,Heavenly!!!!,I LOVE BELINDA CARLISLE. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE GO-GO. SHE COULD REALLY ROCK. I LIKE BELINDA'S VOICE SHE HAS A NICE SWEET VOICE!!!! MY FAVORITES ON HERE ARE HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH AND I GET WEAK. THIS IS A NICE ALBUM TO HAVE. IF YOU LIKED BELINDA WITH THE GO-GO'S THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS ALBUM.
5,his favorite,"Once in a while he goes for a ride but most of the time my husband is the one who really listens to music a lot, most of the time while he excersizes. He has a walking problem so focusing on music helps him while he walks on a treadmill"
1,A RIPP OFF!,"This is the perfect example of what critics mean when they say ""that book is Derivative!"" The Nuyorasian anthology is trying to ride the coat-tails of the famous Aloud: The Nuyorican Anthology of the genuinely hip Nuyorican Poets Cafe but this time with a cast of asians who are not spoken-word oriented or don't even live in New York. A look of the contents page already suggests that the REAL Nuyorican anthology is much more diverse and expansive in its editorial choices. The work itself in the NuyorASIAN anthology is bland, lack-luster, without elan or duende. A dissapointing collection which was badly conceived."
5,Game Of The Year!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is going to kick every other games a** in 2005. It will be a close running between this and the new Zelda. The graphics are the best ever seen on the Gamecube and maybe some the best ever seen on a console!!! The game already looks to be a Game of the year nomonie for 2005!!!!
3,Not bad,"I did enjoy this game very much, But I think its kind of disapointing because it really is nothing like any of the other RE games. You dont get the same feel when you play this after youve played the other 3. I didnt like the enviorment and the zombies seemed so new and the graphics stuff like that makes me think this doesent belong in the Resident Evil series. But when you dont compare it too the other games in the series Its not a bad game at all. Infact I thought the new ideas for it were great, how you can buy guns and collect money. All in all its not a bad game but a disapointing entry to the series. If you wanna play a good RE game with the same main character, better zombies, LOTS of gore, and will make you $#!% your pants go play Resident Evil 2 now."
5,GOTY 2005,"I know it's too early to be praising, but this game deserves it. Only one game can knock it off this year and that is Legend of Zelda. If this game came out last year, it would've been GOTY. Forget Half-Life 2, forget Halo, forget Mercenaries this is the best hands-down. You'll be doing yourself a crime if you don't play this."
4,Only 1 Flaw Keeps It From Perfection,"Yes, if you read all the other reviews, I only have a few things to add. Yes, it sucks that you can't run and shoot. Think of it this way: if you run and shoot, you won't be aiming straight. I have something to fix this: during aiming, if getting rushed, hit down+B to do a 180, run a little, do another 180, and attack. Besides this, a fun game, especially with the Handcannon with Max upgrades (Take THAT you chainsaw pysco!)."
5,Excellent,"Game mechanics, this is a little different than the previous versions. For instance, there is a lasersite to help pinpoint aiming. There is a closer over-the-shoulder camera view. You are provided with more ammo. You can rearrange your carrying case to make room for extra items. Graphics are impressive. It is still pretty much a linear path, but the areas are big enough that you really don't care about exploring beyond. Saving opportunitites occur more often.The biggest problem is the control could use a little tweaking. Well, a combination of control and camera angle. However, it isn't too bad compared to other 3D games. Other than that, I really can't complain. I just need to work on my aiming coordination better."
3,Information...,"As I'm sure you all know by now, RE4 is coming to the PS2 a few months after the GC release, and there are rumours that it will also be released for XBox after that. So much for the GC being 'the only system that could handle all that power'..."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!,"The stories in this book were stupid, unbelievable, and extremely boring!!! The only good story was of course written by Zane, the other stories were just horrible!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Meh, it's okay...","...not sure what I really expected from this book. Some of the stories are just plain WEIRD. Not kinky weird, just weird in a way that would never spark my interest, especially not in a sexual/ erotic way. The couple of stories that weren't straight up strange were not very memorable so I won't bother to review those. In all, not a complete waste of money since I was mildly entertained by a couple of the stories, but other books are much better in my opinion."
5,Original recordings...,"The used copies of this best-of are all dirt cheap. So without any other reviews of this item I was nervous that I was looking at a collection of re-recordings that Gene Vincent had cut, or that something else was wrong here. But no, these are the real deal! The CD-ROM is pretty lame. Don't buy this is you have all the music but think the CD-ROM will have something to offer you. It won't. The only thing that could make this best-of any better would be the addition of Catman. But, hey, I already have that song, so who cares? Right? 5 out of 5, man."
2,Fun tennis game for a week,"Nice graphics and use of real life players. A lot of pretty well designed mini games. Career mode is fun but could be a lot better. I do like the ability to improve your player to the top level.The game control is okay, but it feels kind of fake and limiting.Overall, I enjoyed this game for a week or two, but after that it just seemed like the same game over and over. I had fun with the game for a little bit so gave it a 3 rating for fun...but only a 2 overall rating because I expect to enjoy a game for more than a week or two. Other games (like golf) are similar where I take a break with them but I always come back to play them because of the skill and fun. This game however, I traded in for credit for other games as I never had the need to play it again.Buy discounted or used if you want to just try it out...but I would recommend renting or not purchasing at all."
3,"Good video's, long and redundant advertizing","Each of the 4 disks has too much advertizing for the other disks in the same set. This makes it hard for someone to sit down and just enjoy the subject matter. Since the 4 disk set contains all the different scenes, all the advertizing should be removed. If done, that would be a good set for modern steam train 'chasers'."
3,these episodes were suppost to be first,"I don't know the story of why Funimation couldn't get it together with originizing the episodes maybe they were trying to make them too fast and lost their head. It starts off with a blast from the past, Emperor Pilaf finally steals the black star dragon balls and summons Shenron! He wishes for Goku to be a kid again and it worked. King Kai comes with breaking news, If the balls aren't return to earth in 1 hour the entire planet will exploded. Little Goku, Trunks, and Pan who snuck on the spaceship are off to search around the universe for the balls."
3,"Works well, doesn't last as long as advertised","This product works well, it just doesn't last the 45 days. More like 25-30. It does keep the razor nice and clean. Much better than traditional cleaning methods."
3,Does not work with Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Wet/Dry,"This item is not intended to work with the Panasonic model ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men's Wet/Dry shaver, even though it was grouped together on the website as often purchased together."
5,I need to order some more,Each filter last me about 60 days. I did make the mistake once of not pulling the plastic sticker off the port.
2,I Do Not Recommend This One,"The Panasonic WES035P Vortex is not nearly as good as the reviewers say it is. Surely, the razor does OK on the face but the big problem is that it does not shave closely on the neck or jaw, wet or dry. It does a barely adequate job and I still have to take a blade to shave my neck and jaw to the usual smoothness.I have a normal beard, nothing heavy. The noise factor is not a problemDo not buy this razor based upon the reviews. It might be OK for some faces but not mine. When I can afford it, I will purchase a higher end Panasonic."
5,Great replacement cartridges for the Panasonic Vortex shaving system,"This is my third time purchasing these replacement cartridges and they work great! Every time I replace the cartridge around two-three months, my shaver feels and shaves clean like the first day I bought it.Would recommend these replacement cartridges any day."
5,Works like a charm,"Just like advertised, OEM cleaning solution. Keeps my shaver clean and running like new. I like that it was a 3 pack."
5,Filter that works,"I've tried to look for this filter for my shaver, and I couldn't fine it. I'm glad that Amazon sells it. The filter fits perfectly and it does the job."
4,A great shaver,"Easy on the face (with shaving cream), a close shave, and quick.Beats my Braun or Norelco."
4,Very nice,"I decided to try this item after Amazon offered it at a great price. I had tried an electric many years ago and couldn't handle the pain of it ripping the hair out of my face, so I went back to a blade.So I was a little afraid to try again. I'm so glad I did. It works great in the shower, and is very comfortable to use. The only complaint I have is that I cannot seem to find replacement blades or cleaning cartridges locally. Not a big deal."
3,Inflation sucks,"I knew when I bought this self cleaning razor that Panasonic would continuously gank me on the cleaning cartridges. Don't get me wrong, I like the razor and the self cleaning system, but as I expected the price of the cartridges keeps going up and up and up. I don't blame Amazon, it is Panasonic to blame because a quick online search will show that it is not just Amazon that is rasing the price on this. Still, if you're stingy with replacing it you can get maybe 1.5 to 2 months out of a cartridge which means you'll be blowing a bit less than a Ulysses S. Grant each year on this shaving system.Still, with all that said, I'm ordering my semi-anual refill today... cha-ching."
1,Cleaning unit is too bulky and too much fuss...a pricey gimmick!,"I have been a Panasonic electric shaver user for over 20 years and I would say that makes me a pretty loyal customer. I am sorry to say, though, that I am disappointed with the HydraClean Shaving System. I think it just an expensive gimmick. The cleaning unit is bulky, the cartridges expensive, and the system highly ineffective. I get a better cleaning by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil and just rinsing the wet-dry shaver under the faucet. It even smells much better than the Panasonic cleaning solution. Take it from an experienced electric shaver user, don't waste your money on the HydraClean shaving system or on the expensive cartridges."
1,don't buy them they are not good,I have used my Hydraclean Shaving System for a while and always like the fresh smell of the system but NOT these Cartridges.For some reason the smell of cartridges are not fresh and good. I did not send them back but I am not going to buy any more either.May be they are very old and stayed in their warehouse for years and kind of dried out since there is no expiration date on them I cannot be sure but the bottom line they are not good.I may try to call amazon any way and write a follow-up
4,Sweet Smell of Clean,"Before using the Panasonic WES035P Vortex Shaving System Solution Cartridge my Panasonic razor shaved beautifully, but I had to hold my breath while clearing the stubble from my face. Over the weeks the combination of sweat and whiskers led to a rancid odor that made me consider going back to shaving cream and a safety razor. Using the Vortex Cleaning system returned the electric shaver to the sweet smell of clean. If you own the Panasonic ES-93K razor, use the cleaning cartridges. Although a little pricey, unless you enjoy holding ypur breath every morning, these are a good investment."
4,Subscribe and Save to the rescue,"Once again the product that I needed was available on subscribe and save. The additional 15% discount sure makes a nice overall deal. The Hydraclean system requires to be changed every 30 days or so. It keeps the razor, a major expenditure in good working order."
3,Decent bargain,Good product but manufacturer claims each cartridge lasts appx. 1 month. I've never had one last past three weeks. Big Panasonic fan but that's very mis-leading.
4,Good condition,"The book was in perfect condition. I would have prefered the item arrive early, as other amazon items usually do, but it arrived on time so I can't complain too much."
4,The mirror universe!,"Captain Sisko is attack by Chief O'Brien, at phaser-point, and transported to an alien ship there he it is revealed that he is in the alternate universe and his wife is still alive. The alternate universe Kira is evil, she runs Terok Nor with Garak by her side, together they are planning on making a deadly weapon that will kill all that oppose her, until Captain Sisko emerges, the one man who can put a stop to Kira's plan and be reunited with his wife!"
4,One of the best,"It's surely the best Elton John's album in the past 15 years. It's not a classical E.J.'s album, because it's quite rock, with almost no piano heard. But it's so deep and sweet."
4,the one,good amazon seller fast ship even during holidays..hope to purchase from them again in the future.. great CD great price ...!!
5,Nutritional Influences on Illness: A Sourcebook of Clinical,"I have had the good fortune to be in possession of the first and second editions of this valuable infiormation on the necessry part nutrition plays in good health and good fortune. As an RN of days gone by I was happy to share this information with every health care professional I contacted. Werbach opened the door which brought REAL attention to the importance of GOOD NUTRITION. Thank you for asking....Sincerely, Roberta M Thorpe"
2,"Politics aside, there might be a story here ... somewhere ..","The return of a famed Bajoran resistance leader poses a unique challenge for the world of Bajor, seemingly in endless political disarray already. Shakarr's arrival appears nothing more than an attempt by the writers to say 'Hey, let's not forget about Bajor, in the midst of all of the other subplots that carried successfully throughout DS9's own continuity. Certainly not a stinker, SHAKARR just didn't explore new territory; quite frankly, it was an inferior single episode retread of Season Two's fantastic three-part opener, regarding almost all of the same themes."
5,A Strong Episode,"Okay, so I'm not exactly a veteran DS9 viewer. However, recently I've really gotten into reading about the show ( at startrek.com and reading the excellent episode guide ). Finally, a few days ago, I stumbled upon an episode on T.V. I was thrilled to find one and have been watching it regularly since. Today's episode was Shakaar, which I believe is an excellent action AND character oriented show. It may be a tired retread of earlier episodes, and that's entirely possible. Every Star Trek show has its certain flavour, and that can get tiring after awhile. However, since I'm not accustomed to DS9 yet, I can enjoy even the slighter episodes. I don't believe in any way though that Shakaar is a ""slight"" episode though. The characters are strong, particularly the title one. I also like how one of the villain's soldiers ( a ""bad guy"" ) is confronted in a scene where life and death matters are discussed like the results of a recent football game. Overall a very good episode."
4,Could've been better....but....,"The video for Heartbreaker more than makes up for the rest of the collection's shortcomings! That one is totally hilarious! I didn't realize just much fun that video was! I was disappointed, however, that the video for SOMEDAY was live. I wanted to hear the remix version of the song that was used for the video. All in all, it is a fair collection, but I think they need to come out with a complete video collection that includes some of the minor hits like ""THE ROOF"". I think this project would make an excellent Sony/Def Jam collaboration!"
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! (Wonderful film, horrible DVD)","I am stunned at all the 5-star reviews here--they are all reviewing the movie Rikyu (which is definitely a 5-star movie) and not the DVD that you will be buying. The DVD is the worst I have ever seen. It will frustrate you if you try to watch it, and will frustrate you even more if you know how good this movie actually is.This DVD would be a rip-off at $1. It is grainy, contrasty, and blurry. Nobody will enjoy watching it.And if you buy this, you are rewarding people who are treating this masterpiece this shabbily."
2,A disappointment,These pot scrapers are smaller and flimsier than the old pan scraper they are replacing. I would also say that they are overpriced.
4,Scrappers,These work well. I have found they wear down after awhile. Different corner edges helpfull but need one with a sharper angle.
5,"Funny, Sexy and Entertaining","I am a big fan of small town romances and this book is going right onto my favorites list. Emma Jean Frasier is a great heroine...flat broke and returning to a town she hates. Meanwhile, the town of Joyful is convinced Emma went off and became a big time porn star and is opening a strip club.Johnny Walker is a wonderful hero. Sexy and strong, he really is driven crazy by Emma Jean, the girl he has never been able to forget. His revelation at the end was beautiful and left me smiling long after I finished the book.The other characters in the town add a lot of laughs and quirkiness. I loved how the mayor got what was coming to him.Emma's friend Claire, the grumpy old cleaning lady, the dirty old man who pines for the sex doll his dog popped...just all so funny and entertaining.She Drives Me Crazy is a fun, funny, fast-paced read that is definitely worth checking out."
4,Music magic!,"As a long-time fan of Andreas' I eagerly anticipated this DVD, and I am not disappointed. The only real criticism I can mention is that the video quality, mostly shot more than twenty years ago, isn't great. But it is adequate. The sound quality, however, is excellent. I have noticed only extremely minor variations in sound levels, and few at that. However, I do have pretty good equipment, and maybe that helps. I won't know until I play this on someone else's (lesser) system. Lot's of music with stellar musicians. Nice to find Eliza Gilkyson lending her vocal talents here: she is a marvel to see performing her own material live! Also lots of documentary-style additions, which I find very interesting."
4,Works as advertised,"Quality product that does what it says it does. It's convenient that it doesn't require batteries, although it's not as bright as it would be otherwise. The battery required for the IR light isn't standard and was hard to find, but it worked fine without it.It's amazing to see how many stars you can't see with the naked eye."
5,I love this soundtrack!,"This is a great soundtrack! The instrumentals have a Irish touch that makes them especially appealing. ""Burning Off Steam"" ""Fighting For Dough"" ""Book of Days"" and ""End Credits"" are the best! Though it does get a bit boring after a while, I could listen to this CD for hours."
3,incomplete,Doesn't have everything you might want.I immediately noticed no 'Chanson Pour Les Petits Enfants.'One of your favorites may be missing too!
2,Sent it back,The illustrations are sometimes scary and some of the nursery rhymes selected are scary too. I sent it back.
2,exhale core fusion,Didnt care for this workout. I thought it was slow and didnt feel like I worked out as much as I would have liked. The picture on the front of the dvd leads you to believe it will be a great work out with great results. Not for me.
4,"A bit shaky in places, but good overall.","Like great art, The Kids in the Hall are not meant to be liked by all, but loved by a few. The first season sees some highs and lows that remind me why I love them and why some see no point in the Canadian series.While ""These are the Daves I know"" and ""Thirty Helens Agree"" keep me in stitches, some of the sketches (especially the overplayed ""Crushing Your Head"" in the first episode) grow less humorous and more tedious as the episode goes on.I recommend this for fans of Kids in the Hall (obviously) and those who enjoy ""The Simpsons,"" ""Mr. Show with Bob and David,"" and any of the late night fare on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It's not always funny, but wait a minute and it'll get better."
5,Revisit an old favorite,What a treat to revisit Lorne Michaels' best creation'. The comedy still holds up after so many years have passed by.
4,A Soldiers Tale....,Solid product. Have wasted many a deployed hour leveling up my characters. Not to sure about the multiplayer aspect due to inability to play over the internet but it sounds solid. Love the ability to create your own modulars. The interface is extreamly easy to learn and still provide a complex system. The chat scripts are a little tricky but its worth it in the end to learn...
2,"Wardley Premium Algae Discs, 8-1/2-Ounce",I have purchased these in the past and they were great. I like that the packages were much bigger and cost less then I could find them locally. This time when I purchased them the disc's were about the size of a very small pea (like a pellet) not like before were they were about the size of a dime. They would work fine for small fish but are a pain for me since I have several very large ones and have to put 16 in my tank versus the 4 I used to do. Amazon was good about the return but I really wish the product would have stated that they had changed the size and I would not have ordered them.
3,Not their favorite,I have two huge pleckies and they need to be very hungry to eat these wafers. They will search the tank for other fish food for hours before eating these. My snails clean up. Disappointed.
1,What A Waste,"When I first got this machine 3 years ago I was excited. It has so many stitches compared to the simple Brother I previously owned which only had straight and zigzag stitches. This is digital which made it seem fancy and fun.Alas, this machine is a P.O.S. [Pile O'(fill in the blank)]. I sew only a moderate amount. I've made some bags and a king size quilt with this machine. It is now broken for the second time. I had it repaired for $130. The repair man told me that the Singer brand is no longer reliable since the manufacturing has moved to China. He assured me that the machine would break again (obviously he was right) and rather than waste another $130 to get it fixed I would be better off investing in a better machine. It's no wonder most of this model are being sold as ""refurbished."" They should just be sold as ""rubbish.""No more Singer's for me!"
1,Singer 7444 Not Worth It,This machine is cheaply made and not worth the money. I got rid of it after using for only 2 months. I don't recommend.
3,"Informative, But Poor Diagrams Make Implementation Difficult","This book is informative and provides a good explanation of the concepts of canine acupressure. However, rudimentary diagrams make it almost impossible to identify specific points on the body. Without this critical guide, the practical application of the information in this book, is limited.When I purchased this book, it was my hope to add acupressure to the massage therapy I am able to provide for my dog. However, without a natural intuitive sense of these pressure points, I am at a loss to apply pressure without a specific diagram that would show me the exact location of the numerous points on the canine body.It is a shame as it is basically a very fine book, but given the context, I consider the lack of exact direction in finding the acupressure points a significant flaw."
5,Eva Cassidy wrenches your heart!,"I have all of Eva's CD's and ordered this from Liaison Records before I found it at Amazon.com for less money. Nonetheless I would pay about anything to have Eva's music. She absolutely has the power to wring your heart out to dry. There is something so haunting and beautiful about her music that no one can duplicate. Her loss is such a shame; I'm sure she would have gone on to produce more beautiful music. I was elated to discover one more CD, when I thought I had all I would have of her music. I don't even like the song ""Ain't No Sunshine"" and she has me loving it! She has her own unique style that simply transforms music. Buy this CD, you will be mesmerized and play it over and over again!"
4,How can anyone not love Eva Cassidy?,"I first listened to this album about a year ago and was moved to tears by the title track. Eva Cassidy was without a doubt one of the best female vocalists of her generation. Some of the tracks on the album are a little bit country for my taste, but on the whole it is a divine mix of soul, blues and contemporary standards arranged by Cassidy in her in inimitable style. Put it on your wish list today!"
5,How messed up is the Music Industry?,"Short and sweet: This is a great album no mater what you label it, pop, power pop, whatever. It's just a damn shame that we are forced to listen to that RAP CRAP when stuff like this is out there, no wait it's not available at this time. WAY TOO BAD!"
2,Great material and examples but sloppy execution,"This book has a great selection of well chosen tutorials BUT they are riddled with showstoppers. Sometimes the files necessary to complete the tutorial on not on the CD, as they claim they are, and quite often the instructions are either poorly worded, mis-worded, or so obtuse that you can't figure out what they are trying to communicate. It feels as if they wrote the book without going back and making sure that the tutorials and examples actually worked. A very lazy editorial process at best. I was excited about the material when I picked the book up but became frustrated and downright pissed at the number of times I had to skip huge sections because the text was seriously flawed. Its an expensive book and it doesn't deliver on its promise."
5,.,Just as I remembered as when I was young! I loved this movie and my 6 year old daughter & her group of friends did too. Visual effects were representational of the 80's but the girls weren't phased as they were enjoying the story!
5,"I love this movie, really, really, really, much.","During the Halloween season, I used to watch for HBO to play the THE WORST WITCH when I was little. Now I would like to have it to watch all season long. Please have a heart and release this movie again. Thanking you in advance, hopefully buyer."
5,MILDRED ROCKS THE PARTY!,"I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE OTHER REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE. I, AS WELL, REMEMBER THIS MOVIE FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES AND IT JUST GETS BETTER EVERYTIME!"
4,Magnifer not very strong,"It does help with magnification, but it is fairly limited in what it can do. The angle has to be just right in order for words not to be distorted. I bought it for a friend who needs large print versions of books. It is not as easy to read as a large print book, however."
3,Quark and Odo go mountain climbing,"When Quark is indicted to testify against members of the O'Ryan syndicate, Odo arrests him and they begin their journey to trial in a runabout. However, in route, they discover that the runabout has been sabatoged and end up crashing on a remote planet. The runabout is unsalvagable, and so the only way the constantly at-odds pair will be rescued is to carry a transmitter to the top of a mountain...together.Although the banter between Quark and Odo is always entertaining, I found this episode to be a little slow in the middle. If you are a huge fan of the Quark/Odo matchup, I'd say purchase it. Otherwise, there are better episodes of DS9 to spend your money on!"
1,This single is copyprotected - Don't buy it!,Copyprotected CDs may not work correctly on your CD-player or they might even damage your CD-player. Let the record companies know what customers think about copycontrolled CDs - Don't buy this CD and don't support copycontrol!Thalia is a wonderful artist and I love this song. I didn't buy this single because it was copyprotected.
1,MONK IS JUNK!,"I really want to give this piece of garbage a Zero. Actually, I only watched part of one episode, I don't know if it's from season one. I am a Columbo fan, and a detective writer. I saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform. The platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in! A toilet with flowers in it. He reacts to colds? I saw a classroom full of kids. EVERY ONE had a cold! Not very realistic. Kiddie video game pacing, with no proper build up. They don't make stuff for intelligent people anymore! If you are new to this series, watch some before you buy. Maybe some of it is ok."
3,"The set was a great idea, but had problems with the Extras","I couldn't wait to get this set. The first thing I did was to watch the extra material. Hmmm. No sound. Well, there was the background music, but couldn't hear the voice track. There was one part of one clip where Bitty's voice came through, but otherwise nada. Amazon sent me a replacement, but it had the same problem. I went through all the episodes, and they worked. But just couldn't get a voice track out of the extra material.Is it just me that had this problem? For me it ruined an otherwise outstanding buy."
4,Patti sends me!,"I have a fondness for live albums, especially when I know the artist can sing, and Patti is a stellar performer. The cd has two studio cuts that are outstanding, especially the dance groove of All Right Now. Some of the outstanding live cuts are, Somebody loves you Baby with talented soulful backing vocals, and the When you've been Blessed with full gospel choir. Hero is dedicated to her sister and all those loved ones we take for granted. Patti has no problem reaching out to all people, gay, straight, black and white. Her signature song, Over the Rainbow with her impressive soaring vocals closes the set. The lady gives her all, and the audience shows its appreciation. If you have never seen Ms. Labelle live, find out what you have been missing. Highly recommended."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this for my own use as a signalling device, not as a toy. But its almost useless to me and I can't imagine any kid wanting it as a toy. Same reason in both cases - in order to create the actual whistling sound it is supposed to I (an adult) have to blow as hard as I can - anything less produces not much more than a squeak. And either way, its piercing all right, but not very loud at all. I doubt most kids could blow hard enough to make it work properly, if that's what you want to call it. I'd return it but it's not worth the effort. It's not a 10 cent item, but it's not even worth that much. I'll look for a good quality version of the old style whistle with a ball in it."
5,This is great! But not a toy! Ha ha!,"I ordered two of these whistles to add to my comprehensive preparedness boxand am quite pleased. They are great for any outdoor activity, or 72hr kit.I give them a thumbs up for simplicity and reliability due to it's construction.Buy them. Keep them with your packs, emergency kits, what not. Funny howamazon says this is a toy."
2,Requires too many life changes to be practical,"After reading this book I was extremely depressed. The advice the author gives would require so many life changes that it is not practical. So I am back to the ""everything in moderation"" philosophy. I do not believe that most people would even attempt to follow this advice. I am not saying that the author isn't right. His program requires more changes than most people would be able to stick to."
3,so-so,This is a clunky phrase book and I preferred the LP phrase book format over the RG. Many key words were hard to find.
4,good cap,The only reason I didn`t give this 5 stars was because of the price. It is the same as the original one so good quality but considerably higher priced than the 58mm cap.
4,Good fit.,I lost the original in a crowded place when I was bumped by a big person. This one fits a lot better and has not poped out even in a similar situation.
5,Awesome Tool for preaching through the Gospels,"It is a awesome tool for preaching though the Gospels. It contains no commentary, which I like. It just lays out all four gospels in chronological order in comparison with one another. Great tool for anyone that wants to learn the order of Jesus' ministry."
1,Junk,The camera arrived and does not feed the film at all. So it is unusable. Very disappointed. Not at all what description said it to be.
4,A great idea,"I really like the idea of this product, and it is a great thing to have around the house. It is wonderful for parties. You can keep you white wine out on the counter so people aren't going in and out of the refrigerator or just assuming that there isn't any white. It is much easier to deal with than an ice bucket and works very well. The product description is a little misleading, as it says ""Chills wine bottles in 5 minutes and keeps them cold for 3 hours without ice."" This will not chill a room temperature bottle of white wine in 5 minutes. I would also question whether it would keep a cold bottle chilled for as long as 3 hours. That being said, for the price, it's a great item to keep at home in the freezer and works wonderfully to help keep a pre-chilled bottle cold for the duration of a meal, or maybe a little longer."
5,The most under rated single of the year.,"Diary Of A Wimp is one of, if not the best Space song ever. It is a happy, emotional, romantic, half rock, half pop song and it is amazing. It didn't make the UK Top 40 unfortunitly due to a lack of airplay, the main culprit being Radio One. This song is superb and is a fantastic release.If I Ever and Raymond are both pretty average songs but are not Space classics. But after Tin Planet, anything from Space is good. Diary Of A Wimp is a must for all Space Fans. Buy It NOW!"
4,awesome flash for new and old cameras,"This flash has more features than most people will use. It is one of Nikon's top end flashes, and as such is very powerful and versatile. I have used it as a camera-mounted and remote for film and digital. One of the best features I've liked is the flash-fired remote capabilities. If you have a camera with a weak flash, you can add this to fill the foreground, background, or anywhere in between. Of course the flash really shines in a complex professional setup linked to high-end cameras, but you can also fire it from the flash on your camera, regardless of price or brand. This flash works fine with digital and film SLRs. It's a Nikon, so you know it will perform for many years."
4,wow,Fantastic flash- very versitile. The various auto and TTL modes are much cleverer than I. Works supurbly with my D100. The only complaint I have is that you may need to sell a car to buy one. Otherwise this product is a 5.
5,Book,Great book and really breaks it down for new teachers. It was shipped quickly to my home and I appreciate it.
4,"""Cafe con Leche"" - Be Ready to Stir in a Whole Lot More","As a student soon to graduate with degrees in Spanish and Latin American Studies and as one who lived in the Dominican Republic for some time, this book is fascinating. It discusses the very serious and prevalent issues of identity, ""race"", and ""racism"", that exist in many parts of Latin America on some level. It is a perceptive and intelligent look at a very real topic that is usually not found in detail about places such as Venezuela, or Latin America in general for that matter. I found it to line up with all of my study regarding Latin America as well as my experiences in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. I learned from this book, and so will you."
2,cute but too slow,I have 3 month old son and he likes when things move little bit faster than this mobile. He watches it for a little while and than looses interest also the song is a little bit too loud but this is a matter of opinion. If I could listen and watch the mobile before I would probably not buy it. The characters are cute and the frog will be useful. Might be we will get used to it.
4,Love the froggie pacifier holder.,"The mobile was not that great because you have to constantly wind it for it to play and spin. Also, the part where you manually spin for the mobile to play broke the second day. Needless to say, I wasn't too happy about that. But, I am still using the froggie pacifier holder. I love that! It's so cute and it's hands are crinkly which my baby loves. Overall, there are better car seat mobiles out there. Some of which Tiny Love makes. I recommend buying a non-manual mobile."
4,Will There Be Enough For A Volume 4?,"Not up to the standards of the first two volumes, Elton moves along valiantly nonetheless. Not his best stuff, to be sure, but the music is good."
4,One of his greatest songs but not his greatest album,"""I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues"" is an absolute masterpiece of a song that I can listen to over and over, and it is the main reason I'm happy I bought this album. Elton's 1st collection of Greatest Hits is by far his best, and I like this compilation better than Gretest Hits Vol. II. ""Sad Songs"" and ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" are fun pop songs, ""Little Genie"" and ""Nikita"" are nice love songs and he has a few on the melancholy side like ""Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word"" and ""Empty Garden."" Overall, this is a very strong album (I guess that's why call it greatest hits), but it is not of the quality of some of his earlier work. I am anctiously awaiting another collection of grestest hits after 1986."
4,good record,not for me on par with his first hits one but the r-n-b influence on his late 70's work is good music.and his early 80's stuff is pretty good as well.he is a good solid talent.
2,OK,This worked or atleast seemed to work on my first bottle. When I orderd another bottle I would feel that jittery effect when it was wearing off. I thought it was me or in my head at first but it kept happening. I still have a half of bottle that I am not going to use.
2,No results.,"I took this product and Seredyn together and I took the highest recommended dose on each, still didn't feel any different. So I think it's safe for me to say this product didn't really work for me. Everybody is different though so maybe it'll work for you."
2,"NOW Foods True Calm Amino Relaxer, 90 Capsules","True Calm Amino Relaxer: I tried this a few times and it didn't do anything for me. Maybe I didn't try it enough or maybe I didn't use enough capsules, not sure. The capsules were very easy to swallow."
1,Fake,I tried the capsules for a week and found it completely ineffective. Look around for other effective product. Its useless.
1,I gave it a try,"I didnt have much hope that this will actualy do something, I just gave it a try because its not expensive.... and its money wasted. If you think like me ""Ahh.. lets give it a try...."" well try something else, maybe go for a bit more expensive stuff. But the main question here is... who the hell left this 5 star reviews...."
2,placebo,Ive tried many different things for anxiety and this did not do anything at all for me. I would recommend phenibut or kratom or 5-htp or B vitamins.
3,Won't buy it again!,"I picked up maybe 9 or 10 cans of this on clearance at my local Walmart. I'd never heard of it before, but the ingredients looked like good quality and the price was affordable. My cat enjoyed it, but the frequency of his #2's sure increased, from once every day or two, to often twice per day! And they were smellier and messier than when I was feeding him Eagle Pack wet food, so it just makes me wonder if there are more fillers in this food than the manufacturer states. Or something that just makes it less digestible for him? I don't know, but after a week of this, I can't stand this food anymore and the last two cans are going to my dog. Also, the smell of the food itself is quite strong due to the lamb, and I found that intolerable after awhile as well."
3,So so,These tweeters from boss are just so so. They sound good when they are working but they don't last. Had my for maybe 5 months and then they stopped working. Boss makes a good amp but their speakers lack and wont hold power. Replaced them with some alpine and man the alpines scream.
2,My People the Sioux,This book was not very exciting to me. I feel asleep multiple times reading it. I only read this book because I had to for a class.
5,"Relax, it's just a movie.....","OMG, a bad horror movie. Boo-Hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Instead of watching this movie like a clueless movie critic, try watching it just for entertainment purposes, and you will like it. Yes, it wasn't shot with a huge budget, and top-notch actors weren't hired, but they did do good with what they had. I feel this movie was fairly good, and should be given a chance. So, if you're anal about movies, take a ""chill pill"" and relax and enjoy the movie. You will like it............."
5,Childhood favorite,"This book contains many elements that would make for an enjoyable child reading experience. These elements include wonderful illustrations, a terrible evil character, and characters of many ethnicities. The element that stands out the most from this story is the incorporation of music and sounds. A song fills at least six pages of the text and is a central factor in the story. Also, the use of onomatopoeia pervades the story with words like ""zoop,"" ""ztt,"" and ""clunk."" These are great at engaging the senses and the participation of young children. I also like the idea of showing unlikely heroes prevailing over evil in the end."
1,Scared my three year old,"This book was read to my daughter in pre-school and really frightened her. I'm not sure how the teacher read it to her, but for days afterward she kept worrying that Abiyoyo was going to eat her/get her or eat and hurt Mommy. She's a pretty tough kid, but this book had her crying she was so frightened by the monster and the story. It may certainly have merit, but perhaps is more appopriate for slightly older children."
2,Missing Parts,Book was in awesome condition and great for the kids however it was to come with a CD for listening and it was no where to be seen. I had to reorder from a different company so that I could complete my lesson with the kids. Amazon is supposed to send half of the total cost back to me because of this issue but it was not enough to cover the cost of ordering the new book and CD..
3,"Good, but not quite right","This was a book I bought on recommendation from a reading list. It was well illustrated, but definately not a ""happy"" type book. It doesn't teach as much as it illustrates, and it was too far removed from my kindergartner's level of understanding int he story line. Maybe for older kids? I just thought it was OK."
1,Bad News Camera,The most flimsy camera Nikon has ever made with a very bad lens. Junk. Most used Nikon film cameras are much better than this.
2,You can do a lot better,"This camera's title is misleading. The FM series has a long, distinguished history, ending with the fantastic FM3A. The FM10 not only doesn't deserve to be considered an FM, but it isn't even made by Nikon. The specs are outsourced to who knows where, preying on people's trust in the good Nikon reputation. The build is quite cheap, and you will know it as soon as you pick the camera up- lots of plastic. You can get a much better price on a used but much higher quality (and authentic) Nikon, so if you're in the market, shop around plenty, because the FM10 is a ruse of shameful proportions."
1,Not made in USA - Not well designed either,At the time of purchase the product description and origin both indicated it is made in the USA. It is made in China. The instructions are poor and from what we could tell attachment of the leash to the harness is accomplished by looping around the harness instead of having a clip-on point. Returned it.
4,Klingons Galore,"This is one of my favourite Klingon episodes from any of the Star Trek series. The show gives some great insight into the Klingon culture. Suspecting that Gowron, leader of the Klingon empire is a Changling, Sisko, Odo, Chief O'Brien and Worf go undercover to expose him and terminate his control by whatever means possible. Prior to leaving DS9, Sisko, Odo, and O'Brien are transformed into Klingons by the skills of cosmetic reconstruction and venture off to embrace their destiny. I do wish this was on single issue DVD rather than VHS but it is still good."
5,Per=Fit disposable diapers.,"This product is an exceptional value, Ive been buying them for about a year and am very satisfied.Per-Fit Briefs, Large, 18 Briefs (Pack of 4)"
4,A Hidden Gem!!!,"I bought ""Nemesis Divina"" first and after a few listens it began to grow on me like some rare Scandinavian lichen used to promote euphoria. Next, I purchased ""The Shadowthrone"" with equal results. I then began a sojourn through the tangled forest that is Amazon.com and came across a review that stated something to the effect that there are only 3 Satyricon albums worth owning: the 2 aforementioned, and ""Dark Medieval Times."" It took some time to get it, being an import (over 2 months waiting...), but I was instantly pleased with the atmosphere of the album. I felt transported to 1349, a dark age filled with ominous clouds, folk music soaring on the wind. This is a Black Metal gem that I hope all fans of the genre make an effort to obtain. Thank you for reading my humble review."
2,It isn't all there,"The music that made it to this soundtrack is just fine. However, if you expect anything beyond the excellent gospel cuts you will be unhappy. I was very disappointed to find that original score music was absent - and it wasn't for lack of space."
1,picture does not match,This product picture is not what you get. They sent me a much cheaper and inferior briquette(white and oval shaped). The pink Pyromid briquettes from the picture is not what this is. The picture above is not what you get.
1,Broken within the first two months,"It split down the middle from top to bottom within the first two months. Bought it May 25th and now it won't open at all. You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,pot is no good,This pot was terrible! Everything stuck to the bottom. I ended up giving it to Goodwill. I paid $99.00 for this & I don't recommend anyone buying it
3,Okay product,"For the price, these are not bad. They are light weight and the image quality is great. Repairs are inexpensive, but the customer service sucks! I have had these for about 5 years. I have had to have the eyepieces replaced 6 times. They are really thin and crack all the time. I have had them fall off and get lost on multiple occasions. It wouldn't be so bad if they could replace them quickly and customer service were a more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, neither of those have been true in my experience."
3,Bad stitching,"Received the bag quickly, but much to my dismay, the stitching was terrible by the cover. You could see it ride up and right off the bag, leaving a gaping hole. My mother is very handy with a sewing machine, so rather than dealing with a return/eschange, I had her repair the bag. It's not bad overall and it was $15 cheaper than getting it at Dick's Sporting Goods."
4,"good price, good helmet","Good helmet for the price, I own two. Haven't crashed in one yet, but I am a fan of them so far."
5,This helmet rocks,"The only thing that sucked just a little bit was getting the initial adjustment of straps done, but only took me about 10 minutes. Looks great, fits well and matches my bike perfectly (which I love!)."
2,Uncomfortable and sits way ontop of head,"The straps are uncomfortable, there is a plastic piece that digs into hte back of my head and it sits on top of your head making you look like you should be riding with training wheels. The picture on amazon makes it look much cooler than it is."
4,Remakes...but maybe better,"Like the previous poster, I was also a Country Music DJ in the early 1980's. I found these re-releases very faithful to the origionals, and over the years, her voice has actually gotten better.When I saw this was a remake, I was afraid that ""Grandma's Song"" would be remake of the radio-edit version, but was glad to hear it was the full-length album version, which if I remember correctly from way back, actually featured a recording of her grandmother singing.If someone wants to know what Gail Davies sounds like....think of Anne Murray if she hadn't sold out to Top 40 Radio.If you like the ""Ladies of the 80's"", this is a good album to go on the shelf with your Lacy J. Dalton and Janie Frickie CD's"
4,Dennise Gaertner strikes a good balance,"This commentary was one I used in a class about the book of Acts for Harding University. The commentary does a good job at covering the central points of the text and strikes the delicate balance between being detailed and not becoming overburdened with details. This commentary is fairly conservative and most within the Restoration movement will not have any major qualms with its treatment of Acts, though I suspect many outside of this movement may have disagreements concerning his views on baptism. Also, I found the way he divided the text up useful and convenient for preparing classes at my church. Over all, I think this is a very helpful learning tool that is worth reading if you are not interested in every detail or topic brought up in Acts."
4,fantasy writer,"It is a good source, when writing for younger children. Younger children need simpler words. This book breaks it down to vocabulary for each age group."
2,A small error,"HelloI just bought a book from your company and there is a wrong fact in the book.Children's Writer's Word Book, 2nd edition. Copyright 2006 by Alijandra Mogilner and Tayopa Mogilner.It mentions on one of the first pages that Hispanics are from the Americas, while Latinos are from any place that speaks Spanish.This is wrong.In summary, Hispanics are those who speak spanish and latinos are from latin america including central america. As an example, somebody from Brazil is latin but not hispanic as they speak Portuguese in that country."
4,It Takes Two,"This is the best guide for parents to learn how to encourage their children to communicate. It explains different ways to establish a special bond between parent and child. It explains how children learn to communicate and ways to help your child through this learning process. Examples of games for fun and learning, music activities, art activities, and even a booklist of wonderful books for children to read are given in this book. This book is wonderful for parents, teachers, and all caregivers of children."
2,Do it yourself?!,I was expecting a pink and white piggy bank. I got a blank slate with paint. Not enough to cover the pig even! So now i have to buy sealant and paint and find the time to actually do it.
5,3 Year Old Loves This!,"Iza Trapani's books are definitely a favorite in our household, we have purchased many of them. They are catchy and fun, can be sung, and the artwork is spectacular! This book will be one that is saved for generations to come."
2,"Just ""okay""","I really wanted to like this new expanded version, but ... it's okay. The colors are bright, and book size is big enough for classroom reading. As someone previously mentioned, you wouldn't want to SING all these verses. But I don't think it'll be a book that my preschoolers will go back to again and again, nor request it. Sorry!"
5,Best wallet I've ever owned,"Been carrying the same Taxi brand wallet for about 5 years. Well made, durable and takes up very little room in my purse. Highly recommended!"
5,Inspirational/Sings about everyday life,"Tia sings about everyday life that we all can relate to. Her songs are inspirational and thought provoking. She has a wonderful voice. I have seen her in person and she is a warm and caring person. Tia and Tommy make beautiful music. Her song, ""Hope is Everything"" is a song that I listen to when I need a lift - ""Don't Give up on what Tomorrow will bring - Keep on Believing, Hope is Everything!!!!!!!"" Keep on making music Tia and Tommy!"
2,Great quantity,"It's a great value for quantity, but is not the muslin I am used to for waxing. This is more fabric-y, than the slightly textured wax strips I am used to using. Sometimes, I don't feel as though the wax sticks as well to it. I am still learning, but I probably won't buy this again."
4,"Great, but not enough info displayed on discription.","I am new to self waxing and I was told by a pro that I needed to purchase hard wax. I assumed (I know, my bad) that I would need a muslin roll as well. So when I received my shipment, I read on the roll that it was for soft waxes:( wish they would have mentioned this information on the description:/"
3,nmemelma2,"I am not used to this kind of strips, so I am learning to use them now, and it seems to be okay."
5,Good muslin,"Gigi brand is great, the muslin roll is perfect for body waxing, I usually use the same strip about 3 times or for a better example 1 strip per leg. If you know how to wax and apply a thin layer it works nice. If you don't know how to wax keep practicing and keep your hands clean. Down side of the muslin is the wax can get through and make your hands sticky, another is if you cut small strips for facial wax the threads begin to fall off the edges. It's still the best, I wouldn't use anything else"
4,"Bought this for my best friend, Larry!","During and after his marriage, Larry has been described by his ex wife as a Weasel, which we both could understand; as an ass, which we both could agree with and finally, in a fit of anger, was described as a Penguin. Neither of us get that one. But I sent him this adorable penguin anyway. It is very cute and lovable. Something that any child would love to have. Larry, at 62 loves it also."
2,Close but no cigar,"If you were in Spain this summer and want to find a collection of some of the songs you heard I would recommend Disco Estrella vol.3 for song selection. Disco Estrella and Caribe 2000 are put out by the same company, and although the songs are the right ones, they all sound like they came right out of a cheesy 1980's casio keyboard. No real horns, no real instruments. These are all covers as far as I can tell. Las Mosca Tse Tse did the original ""Para no verte mas"" that was playing in Spain for example."
4,The Way Too Good!,"Am fascinated by the story of friendship, love, loyalty, quirkiness, and theovie making industry. Don't read if hopong only for ""the scoop"" on Clint. Story is muucchhh bigger!"
4,Great color good size and beautiful,"These are of good height and width. They go perfectly together. I use these in my 20g tank and have had them for quite some time now. I placed one at each end of my tank and a small rock w/ a swim through hole in the middle and my tank is full. These plastic plants look great have good color. They really warm the tank (visually). The fish don't hide in them. They are self weighted and perfectly too. I have a bubble wall behind one and it flows beautifully. All my fake plant life will be from this product line. Great stuff! My only complaint is that on my taller brownish red plant, one of the leafs is positioned in a way that seems a bit off to me but I am very anal about everything linking up just perfectly so I don't think a normal person would notice or even care. The issue might just be on my plant (or my brain) I just wish I could reposition it & due to the design I can't."
3,Not bad. Works better with a bigger tank.,"These plants looked really pretty in my turtle tank. I have a green and blue background and so the blue and purple look stunning. However, the package says they are self-righting. This is a lie. I just put them in the tank a half hour ago and I've fixed the purple one twice. I am afraid they will hurt my turtles. I'm going to wait until I get a bigger tank to put them in again."
4,Aquarium decoration,These aquarium plant are very life like and an excellent addition to any aquarium in place of real plants. Only down side is they tend to wear out fast over a short period of time and discolor easier than plastic plants.
2,Not to biOrb standards,"ehhhh, it could be better. The plants really look fake. The sizes are good. The fish cannot swim through it. It is dense in appearance. Choose something else."
4,A good collection of case examples to practice,"I currently work work for one of the major consulting firms and I have been invoved in many case interviews (both as the interviewee and the interviewer).I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering entering the management consulting industry and requires additional practice cases. You will find a selection of 15 case studies with proposed solutions. Although I do not agree entirly with all the solutions, I thought the book generally provided realistic examples, with well structured and logical solutions.One further point, although you can work through the book yourself, I would recommend that you team up with a ""buddy"" and alternate the role of interviewer /ee. This will stop you from jumping to the answers to soon and enable some feedback about presentation style. The book facilitates this type of role play.Goodluck !"
5,Great DVD,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I had seen Richard perform this show at Joe's Pub a couple of years ago and am going again to Nokia to catch it again. It's nice to see the show memorialized. Some of the bootleg DVDs are so poorly shot, I get dizzy and nauseated. I just don't understand why he's not a HUGE star. He's enormously talented. Amazing Guitarist. Phenomenal songwriter. Great on stage banterer. With or without band, he's an enormously entertaining man."
2,Watch out!!!!!,Yes this case looks nice and it has nice quality. However the felt inside really rubs into your ipod and stains it. It leaves an ugly black smear streaked across it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
2,Who are you listening to?,"This book was written by a woman who injured herself in massage school and then, instead of becoming a massage therapist, wrote this book and now makes her living teaching seminars and selling books. So she may be an expert in what caused HER injury, but does not appear to have any experience actually being a healthy therapist. If your school did not teach anything at all about body mechanics, technique adjustment, or hand safety, you may need this book - but if your school is even the least bit responsible in teaching these skills this book is just an introduction to the concepts. If you need advanced ideas, you won't find them here. Big print, low-quality photos, and self-congratulation seem to be the hallmarks of the book, and I'm glad I was able to leaf through it and not waste my money buying it."
2,Don't let it scare you out of a massage career.,"As a Licensed massage therapist of 8 years, specializing in deep tissue work, I went through a period of injury early in my career, and turned to Ms. Greene's book to get help and hope. Unfortunately, I came away more nervous than hopeful of being able to continue with many years in a massage career that I enjoyed so much. I learned from a colleague that Ms. Greene does not practice massage anymore, and does indeed make her living off of her book, and lecturing, as another reviewer commented. In her book she takes prevention to some extremes that a massage practitioner of any experience would scoff at. I found that my period of injury was a good time to research as much as I could from various sources and figure out what would help me. (And subsequently my clients) This is not to say that there isn't some good information to be gleened from this book, but the author has given up the practice of massage, just consider the source."
4,"Great information, much needed for students and prof's","My massage school offered very little information about injury prevention, so this book was an eye-opener for me. I think many students and even professionals don't take care of their own bodies and need the informaton that's in this book. Many of my fellow students became injured while they were in school and didn't know how to deal with it. I have many friends who are massage therapists, and when they have pain they don't know why or what to do about it. I have had pain in my arms several times, and this book helped me figure out why and get the right treatment to keep it from getting worse. I would recommend this book for any massage therapist."
2,I could not finish this book.,"I have read other books by Elizabeth Moon (the Deed of Paksenarrion and Legacy of Gird sets) and absolutely loved them. I really, really wanted to like this book. She creates excellent characters as always, and a very compelling world - TOO compelling for me! I felt utterly trapped by the protagonist's point of view. I tried several times to finish this book, but it was so excruciating that I just could not go on."
2,WARNING! Not the Cheech & Chong movie!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this movie as a Christmas gift. I told the recipient how hilarious the movie was for weeks prior to sharing an old copy. When THIS movie arrived, it was a puppet show and the previous review had nothing to do with this movie. This is a low budget, saturday morning, public access time killer made to park your kids in front of while you catch up on sleep."
3,Pretty Good for the Nature Photographer,I found this to be a pretty good book for nature and landscape photography. The cover is very misleading. It is a wonderful cover photo and I expected to see a lot more people pictures of that quality inside the book. There is much more weight given to scenics.The information on manipulating the black and white image is well presented.
2,Outdated,"This book would be okay if I still used film, which I don't. The author barely touches on digital and the information on the subject is way out of date."
1,Utter trash.,"This is the most useless waste of paper I have read on Wicca. Sweeping (and horribly incorrect) assumptions and generalizations are made over the history, and the book misleads the reader into thinking there's any sort of advancement in here. This is little more than a hodge-podge of basic Wicca, beginning group-mentoring, and history gone wrong. Sorry, but I will be returning this; I am not interested in more of the *same*."
3,Okay Reading,"This was the third DeLint book that I read. The first was Moonheart which I absolutely loved. Then I read Jack of Kirowan, which I thought was pretty good too. Spiritwalk was the book that naturally followed. I bought this book in July and just finished reading it 5.5 months later. I read Moonheart in about 2 weeks. It was hard to get into Spiritwalk, but once I got into the stories I enjoyed them. I especially liked the last 100 pages of the 398 page book, which I read in a day because the end of that story sparked my interest that much. It was nice to revisit the characters from Moonheart in this book."
1,Stains hair PERMANENTLY,"My son uses these markers at daycare. He decided to put some red or pink on his head, and it has been over a week and no amount of shampoo, alcohol, lemon juice, or other things I've tried will get it out of his light blond hair. I think he has a permanent pink splotch that will have to grow out.UPDATE:The pink in his hair never washed out. It eventually grew out. Stay away from the red and pink colors."
5,Love it!,"My kids love doing ""dot art"". And I love the easy clean up. It's very washable...I don't have to worry if some gets on the table. It just wipes right up with water. Nothing to spill, so it doesn't get all over clothes. It's a fun, no mess craft!"
1,Terrible quality.,"I have had two sets of these given my kids at different times and they were a big disappointment. A great idea but these ones are essentially expensive bingo dabbers and the tips came off very quickly and the paint flowed everywhere.I found Alex to make a much better version and they have lasted us a long time, despite the fact that they are much smaller than the do-a-dot ones. Although the do-a-dot books are good (thick paper, interesting themes), I have found the Melissa & Doug's Jumbo Coloring Pads to be excellent quality and over-all much better value considering their price point on amazon."
1,Complete Piece of Junk!,"I picked one of these up since the price was right and it took me a while to figure out how to assemble it since no directions were provided and the pieces did not fit properly. This is cheaply made junk, and in hindsight I would not purchase this again. I finally got it in semi-working condition, though it will not close completely with 2 AAA batteries in it and the light does not go on every time. Do not buy this item!"
1,cheap junk,"I bought this product because it was inexpensive and looked functional. Well, it's not really inexpensive - it's cheap! Cheap junk. It stopped working the 2nd time I used it."
1,Hoppe's Bore Light - USELESS JUNK,I choice this because of its brand name. It's nicely made but does not work and doomed to failure because of its design. The top battery goes up into the metal top and is so snug that it sticks inside. Takes two pliers to pull it out and the battery is ruined in the process. It never worked and is gone to the garbage. It is fortunate that my other two older bore lights(Not Hoppe's) still work.I do not not recommend any Hoppe's Bore Lights.
1,I second it. What a crappy light,I bought this light at Dicks sporting goods. The quality is terrible I totally agree with the other negative review. please save your money I cant beleive Hoppes puts their name on it.
1,"Calling this thing ""crap"" is an insult to real crap.","Hoppes should be ashamed of putting their name on this garbage. The foil contact in this piece of junk is so thin even if it did work (mine didn't right out of the box), it would break in only a few uses. I've rarely seen a product built this poor. It's unbelievable."
1,crap,unfortunately I bought two of these things. The previous review was spot on....just a piece of none functional crap. The lower battery shorted somehow on the foil and end cap and got so hot it melted the battery coating before I could remove it.
5,great coffee,"We love this coffee! It is smooth and not a bit bitter..Hazelnut flavor is mild, not too sweet like some flavored coffees. We have now signed up for auto deliver to get the best prices and make sure we never run out. Extra bags also make nice gifts."
1,Dry and Terse,"Although the black and white photographs in the book were excellent, the context was dry and terse. Basically, the book was nothing more but a listing of dates and people. The author showed no creativity in making the history remotely interesting.Photos were included that had no text related to them. Anyone who does not have previous knowledge of India's history would not comprehend why the photos were included.Although I am an avid reader, I had to force myself to finish this book."
1,Inaccurate and Misguiding,This book is not based on any historical research. It grossly misrepresents history of ancient India. AVOID.
2,Without a clue,"I ordered this DVD set with great excitement. I waited VERY impatiently for it to arrive. When it finally did I tore open the box and happily placed the first disc into my DVD player. That's when my emotions hit rock bottom. None of the episodes are captioned, that's bad news to a deaf t.v. junkie. The fact had not even entered my mind that they wouldn't be captioned so it was a great shock to me. The television shows are all captioned, all the several t.v. shows I own on DVD are all captioned. Why would such a well know distributor of fine shows like A&E release a show without captioning it? They are the final losers though. Take a look at the percentage of deaf and hearing impaired in our nation. A&E are shooting themselves in the foot by not making it available to those hundreds of thousands. Yes, not just a few, a multitude."
4,Mom of 19month old,"Very Cute! My son loves ""Peekaboo Kisses"" so I decided to get another by this author. He likes this one but not as much. Peekaboo Kisses is a little more interactive with flipping the page to the touch and feel side. Other than that it is still a really cute book."
5,Pipes of Peace is STILL Amazing,"I've always loved this album as a perfect follow-up to the classic Tug Of War album. With all of these songs, my favorites are ""Pipes of Peace"", ""Say Say Say"", ""Through Our Love"" and ""So Bad"". It must not be easy every time a Beatle puts out a new album because fans and critics continue to compare their solo work with the Beatles as a whole. All four have had albums that were great and others that have been less than perfect, but if you take any of their solo work and match it up with the crap of today, Beatles and solo Beatles still reign!!"
3,Bad habit ends/Bright future follows,"This album is as important to the progession of McCartney's songwriting as Tug Of War was to showing Paul could still write a good song. Paul wanted 'Tug'to be a double album but George Martin wanted a single. Simply put, these are the left overs. What makes this album important is he FINISHED the songs. 'Hey,Hey' is a fragment because Paul wanted it to be. George Martin made Paul finish the songs on 'Pipes' and 'Tug'. They made a good decision seperating these two albums because this album is not as strong. These are left overs and Paul knows it with his silly lyrics and jabs at himself (Keep Undercover,The Other Me). Left overs though can sometimes be quite tasty(So Bad,Pipes of Peace,Sweetest Little Show). By relearning to finish songs and not just leaving tasty fragments of what could have been;Paul gives you a competely cooked meal,even though that meal might be more Turkey TV Dinner than Thanskgiving feast.(2.5-stars)"
3,Burn baby Burn,"hmmm....there are great tracs like ""Keep under cover"" or ""Pipes of peace"" but also a lot of material that should have been b-sides.too many bad songs to give it 4 stars but i give it 3 stars for Title track which is amazing."
2,Typical McCartney,"This is a typical McCartney solo album -- a few good songs & the rest fillers (if not junk). Actually there are some really good songs here, such as ""So Bad,"" ""Through Our Love"" & ""Sweetest Little Show."" If it were not for Michael Jackson's appearance on TWO songs, I would have given this three stars."
3,Surreal,"There really is only one reason to buy this CD. Listening to the Brady kids version of ""American Pie"" is absolutely surreal. What were the producers thinking? Dumb question. They weren't."
2,I dont like it,It has a good beet there very happy songs but they should have made up there own songs I will get music from a real band
2,"Could Have Been GREAT, But 2 Major Songs Are Botched!","This is a very enjoyable listen for any Brady Bunch fan but it has two major disappointments: the TV show's theme song is an inferior ""Previously Unreleased Version,"" (as stated on the back of the CD cover), and ""Time to Change"" leaves out Peter's memorable, out-of-tune singing which made the televised version so famous in the first place!Who knows why the record company botched up these two VERY famous moments!?The CD booklet is informative, talking about the musical Brady Bunch adventures, and it has some interesting photos of the live singing appearances.I like this CD enough to consider getting the other Brady Bunch CDs, but it is really a missed opportunity to make the most of the Brady kids music on a ""Best of"" CD, by not giving us the real deal on the original TV theme song version, and on ""Time to Change.""You might also look into the Maureen McCormick CD that she released in 1995."
5,Great Brady Songs,"This CD includes the familiar songs people can recognize easily, but there are also some rarities I never heard before even though I watched the show a lot as a kid. Even though I wasn't familiar with them, I still loved most of them after the first listen."
2,Duel of Iron Fist INCOMPLETE,Delivery of the movie was timely and the quality was excellent HOWEVER it was extremely heartbreaking to get to the final minutes and experience an ABRUPT END TO THE MOVIE CUTTING OFF THE ORIGINAL END! I was under the belief that when I ordered and paid for this movie I was getting it in its ENTIRETY....Who knowingly purchases an INCOMPLETE movie....I NEVER HAD UNTIL NOW! I am so... disappointed! And the worst part is that it was ordered as a special Christmas gift for a loved one!
1,Save your money. Borrow a friends or rent.,"I have three of ""Ties that bind"" now,in hopes of finding one that will play through, and have never gotten past the ladder in the prison due to glitches and lockups. I have compleatly given up now which is sad because the game is so much Fun! I loved this one as much as the original until the glitches kicked in. I really wanted to give this game a top rating in hopes to get a Suffering 3, but as they say in the love stories,""I have been hurt one to many times now""."
1,BEWARE quality of these are LOW,"Have used a variety of minidisc's including Maxell's, other Memorex's (approximately 20 MD-80's), and have never had the problems that I have with these. Sound will momentarily drop out then return, will rewind, doesn't happen. Seems to occur randomly. Have tried to eliminate other variables including recording the same CD on another brand/model MD, and let me tell you it's these. As someone who uses cheap CD-R's when recording music, I never put much faith in reports of media quality, but I got to say this time it is real.For background: I use a Sony MZ-R70. And yes I jog with it, which if where most of the above is coming from, though not exclusively.Again: These are the only MD's I've ever had problems with. Price seemed so great, but now..."
3,"Cool Colors, But Not So Great","The colors are cool, but some are dull- such as the yellow and blue. But even worse, some of the stickers fall off after use and the sound quality and capture isn't that great. I like my Sony ones much more. They also come in cool colors, perhaps cooler, and last much longer. However, they are about a dollar more."
5,It's a high quality and affordable deal!,"When I was placing my first order for 40 discs, I was worring about the quality, because I've seen some concerns over here, among reviews. But after, I tested the first delivery, I was so excited about it, and decided to order another set of 40 discs.I use them every day for recording lectures at my college using LP4 mode in my Sony MZ-R700. A also use 5 Sony colored MD74 discs, and I noticed some jitter with them, which did not happen with my Memorex discs.I think, Memorex is a great deal for those, who are independent in mind from the brand and is more concentrated on the quality."
5,Turns out Tom Paris has character!,"I thought that this was a great episode, and it did alot to develop the characters of Tom Paris and Neelix. I was very pleased when Tom stood the test and did what was right instead of simply taking what he desired. Tom shows us here once and for all that he does have a tremendous amount of integrity...something that was in question at the beginning of the series.I also thought the alien baby was pretty cute....I don't remember any other ST episodes that used an alien baby in quite this way, and I thought that Berman & Co did an effective job of combining plot lines in this episode."
3,"Not for use with the VacMaster VP210 Chamber Machine, otherwise fine with standard countertop sealers","I bought these when I purchased the VP210 Chamber Machine, because Amazon suggested it as an additional purchase with the machine. The tech support at Ary told me these bags were meant to be used with the typical home use machine (food saver type), and that the chamber machines only use plain 3 mil barrier pouches. Using these rolls with the extra middle strip does not produce an airtight bag in a chamber vac, but using it with a sous vide supreme countertop front sealer, the bags are perfect (although the 3 mil seems to be thinner than the food saver brand I am use to using)."
4,good choice over more expensive brand,"I bought this (and the 11.5"" rolls) for my husband, as packing up the food for the freezer is his job, he tells me this worked as well if not better then the ""name brand"" that came with his machine. Wants me to order this brand from now on. (he likes it better & I get to save money .. a win, win)"
1,NOT made in USA,"We ordered this brand because of the price and because the description says they are made in the USA. See copy of product description:Product FeaturesSize: 8-inch by 20-feet Rolls* 2 versatile rolls of bag material for making customized food-storage bags* For use with all vacuum-packaging systems; 3-1/2-mil-thick material* 3rd layer of perforated material creates channel for air to escape to enhance suction* Can be frozen, refrigerated, microwaved, or boiled; made in the USA* Measures 8 inches by 20 feet per rollThere was a label conveniently located over the 'Made in China' printing on the box. We will be returning ASAP! Extremely disappointing!!!"
1,Terrible !,This episode was a waste of film. It was simply another pointless story that failed to entertain or enlighten the audience except for one or two interesting character moments. One of the worse episodes of Voyager and that's saying something!!
2,Not for what I wanted,"I actually got these cuz I thought it would be a cheap verision for some sexy latex gloves, but they just dont compare, so dont buy them for costume, they have a textured black surface... I dont know hwo they work for there intended purpose so I cant comment on that, just astetically not that cool looking"
4,The Master Dubs It Up,"18 Lee Perry productions equals one big slice of madness. Super-organic dub here, with artists like Bob Marley and U-Roy laying it down for the man to command. Reggae's angel writes here one volume of his autobiography."
1,angelcare not the best for your peace of mind,"The Angelcare Movement Sensor with Sound Monitor isn't all it's cracked up to be. False alarms at 1:00am are not what a new parent would call ""peace of mind"". I used the monitor or a week and could not take it anymore. The false alarms were signaling low battery but batteries were in fact new and the AC adapter was being used. Not only does the alarm go off on the parent receiver but also on the baby's unit. SO now not only are you scared to death that your child is not breathing but also the it's another false alarm and it might wake your sleeping baby. The sound only componet of this was terrible as well. It didn't pick up breathing sounds. Not worth the aggravation. Buy the Sony Baby Call Monitor instead or any other simple sound only monitor. Wow. it's really clear and you can hear your baby breathing."
1,A Nightmare for a New Mom!!!,"I was surprised to see that customers had success using this monitor. Perhaps it has to do with the depth of the babies breathing. After a very scary pregnancy and prolonged stay, I brought me preemie home from the hospital. I am constantly frightened that he may quit breathing or something will go wrong. This monitor went off so many times the first night I had to give up and shut it off. Before I did though, I wanted to see if my baby was having apnea or not so I layed my hand on him so I could feel the breathing and the monitor was going off for no reason. I tried adjusting it but nothing I did made any difference. I had more piece of mind putting him in the bassinet & sleeping with one hand on him than using that monitor. I am so dissappointed because I wanted it to work so badly so I wouldn't have to be afraid."
5,Must Have!,"I love this product! I am sooo very glad I purchased it. We have had the alarm for almost three months and it is great. I feel so comfortable knowing that god forbid if my daughter stopped breathing it would go off. It works great. I have had a couple false alarms but not enough to bother me at all, it is still totally worth it. I was told not to get this product by my childbirth instructor and hospital personel because of false alarms.........I am so glad I didn't listen to them this product is amazing! I wish they would tell more parents about them because I feel like more parents, especially first time parents would be able to relax if they only knew about it. Get it!"
2,Very Slow Return Processing,"I wanted to return the baby monitor I bought because it wasn't what I expected. I had to send several emails to get a return authorization. Almost a month after shipping the item back to them I finally got confirmation of the refund after sending another email to inquire about it. Also, they charge a lot for shipping and handling."
2,For the cost I was not impressed...,"I was sure that I had to have this monitor. I thought that is was the best thing in town, after all look at the price.I can not get to my room without major static and interfearance. I am very upseat with this monitor. The thought was a good idea but the actual product did nothing for me.I returned it to get another ""better"" monitor."
5,Sleep Soundly,"We purchased this product because our 4 week old son refused to sleep on his back. Even the day he was born the nursery at the hospital noticed this and propped him on his side. When he got to the point that he could tip over we had to stop that. From the first night we got this monitor he slept for about 4 hours straight, ate, and then slept for another 3 hours. We have used it EVERY night since then and he's 11 weeks now. I would highly recomment this moniter!!!!!Suggestion-I went to a local hardware store and purchased a piece of plywood that was precut to put under the mattress. It works great and is much less expensive than buying the board the company makes with this product."
5,Helps YOU sleep through the night!,"If you're the type of parent who worries about SIDS and checks your newborn to make sure he or she is still breathing, this monitor will give you peace of mind -- and help YOU sleep through the night! This monitor was the first baby item my husband and I bought before our son was born. He's almost a month old now and the monitor has helped us sleep when our son is sleeping rather than wake up every so often to check him. As someone else mentioned in their review, the monitor even worked when we had to put him in a bouncy seat in the crib a couple of nights."
5,excellent product,"We love this. We've been using it day and night with our Pack 'N Play bassinet (with the help of a thick plywood board underneath the mattress for the sensor pad to sit on) for over a month, and it has worked really well so far. The motion sensor registers Baby's breathing, and the sound quality is excellent. We do get some static in a parent unit depending on where in the house we are, but overall they work very well. You can turn off the automatic ""tic"" sound feature and just have it alarm if it fails to detect movement. We set off the alarm regularly when we pick Baby up and forget to turn the monitor off, but it gives you a warning beep before the alarm sounds so you can dive for the ""off"" button. This product has given us such peace of mind, it's totally worth the cost."
5,Knows when your baby is breathing.,"I had no idea there was a product like this out there. It actually monitors whether or not your child is breathing. If it weren't for this monitor, I would be driving myself nuts checking with my hands (and probably waking up the baby doing so). Thank goodnes for this kind of technology!*Another reviewer recommended placing a board or flat surface under the unit. This is great advice if you are using a pack and play bassinet with a soft bottom. It really helps to get an accurate signal."
3,Has some bugs to work out...,"I love the concept of the monitor, but it has issues. I have slept so much better with this monitor in the house, but we had to buy a second monitor to hear sound in my daughter's room. The second night we used this monitor the parent handset went crazy and started giving out a high pitched squealing. Nothing we tried would make the squealing stop. We read a review where the guy kept using this monitor but went out and bought a second monitor to hear the alarm if it went off and if the baby cried. This is what we decided to do. Even though we ended up paying double the price for the convenience of this monitor I would not get rid of it. I get up every night just to double check that it is on. It has given me a great piece of mind knowing that my little one is safe."
5,~Worth the investment!~,"One of my biggest fears when we brought our daughter home was that she would stop breathing. My family said I did that at 6 weeks, and I wasn't taking that chance with the baby I longed for for 5 years. I purchased it before she was born and set it up the day we were home.When she was two months old, the alarm went off two nights in a row. We jumped out of bed, only to discover, she had scooted to the far corner of the crib. False alarm, but we were glad we got this monitor. Make sure you place ply wood or heavy cardboard to form the bottom of the crib to prevent consant false alarms.The sound feature is used when we have play time and she falls alseep on the floor, and I just go to work on my computer and turn on the reciever when I am in the other room.I STRONGLY recommend any parent to be invest in this......You will not be sorry!5 STARS!"
5,LOVE it!!,This mattress sensor is awesome! My husband and I absolutely love it.. and it definitely provides comfort to us knowing that it will tell us when she is completely still and not breathing. I would recommend it for anybody!
5,I confess,"I am a die hard rock and roll fan...Zep, Petty, Stones etc. But when I heard Copperhead Road on the radio I had to buy this CD. I was not disappointed! I have taken some flack for buying a ""country CD"", but after those critics hear a few tracks they are suprised like I was. Buy this CD, Steve Earle is a rocker!"
3,Why bother?,"If your not familiar with Steve Earle introduce yourself with a copy of ""Guitar Town"". The best thing about this CD is ""Copperhead Road"" and the cuts from ""G.T.""."
2,Just could not get into it,"Not sure if this is a no limit album, but the beats sucked, lyrics were boring. A waste of money. He had some good songs on other albums that is what sparked my interest."
4,The movie of my childhood,"Love the actors, find the series entartaining. For some reson in the first couple of episodes there was a little problem with the sound, for a minute or two at the beginning there was no sound at all."
1,Awful,"This was absolutly dreadful. Ann Rinaldi has never written a book so awful in my opinion. I waited three months on this book and spent $11 on it to find it a dreadful mess. Even Rinaldi's worst books have had some historical reward for the waste of time like the Coffin Quilt, but I got nothing from it. And not to mention the charictors. Even her charictor Sarah in Sarah on Her Own was more believable. Phoebe gave nothing to the story, she was a spoiled brat of a girl. but don't let this turn you away from her other books like In My Father's House or Hang a Thousand Trees With Ribbons. Most her books are enlightening and worth the read."
4,..... prolific..... abundant.... profuse,.... MUSIC SCORE .... enhancing this timeless story ... with a MAGNIFICAL soundtrack ... bringing an additional interest to this production .
5,Truly Fundamental!,"I was rather lucky to take my chances and go-for-a-buy for this title instead of the much more cited ""Kandel-Fourth Edition""... The book is really awesome, well-written and edited, with many good first-time-seen illustrations. It spans the whole field of contemporary Neuroscience (from biochemical to cognitive and clinical) with extreme efficacy and reference. The authors did a great job integrating the contents of each section with clarifying examples and extensive references, making it ideal even for new-comers. As a medical student with research interests in this vast field, I was very pleased with my decision to buy this textbook."
1,"Seemed good at first, then the DC4800 went DOWN HILL!!","Before this camera I owned a Canon S10 (GREAT CAMERA). This time I went looking for a 3.1 Meg Pixel camera. This Kodak seemed good at first, but below 3.1 all the picture quality seemed fuzzy (not clear at all like the Canon. Then after 3 wks of use the on/off switch went (perhaps after 300 pictures).Bottom line I am not happy with the camera at all and would recommend NOT buying one."
4,"Love it!!!, a little complicated but thats ok",I love this product. Exceptional picture quality. Go for it
3,"Great for leads, but ....","I bought this book because I do genealogy research and was interested in the genealogies. The book does contain genealogies for the earliest Wisconsin inhabitants, but there are no source citations for where the information was obtained. As a result, the reliability of the information is unknown. Anyone doing genealogy research can use this text to compare information you already have or use the information as potential leads. There is a bibliography included in the book, but it's difficult, if not impossible, to map the bibliography entries to specific genealogies. If the book had source citations for the genealogies, I'd give it 5 stars. But as is, it's 2.5 to 3 stars. Maybe they'll come out with an updated edition and include the source citations....and an index would be nice too :)"
2,What Did The Rain Tell?,"The Regal Sisterhood Book Club selected ""The Rain Will Tell"" for our book of the month in February 2012. While the main character was complex and interesting, the storyline contained too many holes. We never figured out what ""The Rain Was Going to Tell"". This was a fair and commendable debut for the author. We encourage her to completely think out future storylines. We had more questions than answers in the end.* The views expressed in this review are purely for informational purposes, provided by The Regal Sisterhood Book Club - Dallas.

5,Fun ride,"This movie is very different kind of 'super-hero' flick and provided quiet an entertainment. Everyone played their part well. Chloe Moretz completely stole the show (Angelina, it's OK to be jealous and you should be).One warning though... The fact that there was enough of morbid violence, ""F-bomb"" was dropped A LOT, and that a high school girl bluntly acknowledges that she would ""f--k the Kick-Ass' brains out"" (actually a very funny line in the movie), kind of closes the gate to the younger viewers.But otherwise, get popcorn, relax, enjoy, and don't forget to suspend your disbelief."
1,Poor excuse,"A movie that attracts the attention of young people and then has bad language coming out of the mouth of a small girl with her ""Daddy"" approving. People just laugh themselves all the way to hell. We shut it off when we realized that this cute story line was riddled with strong language, sexual insinuations with children and a little girl committing mass murder."
5,More for Teens,My daughter and I went to see this when it first came to the theatre. It was funny but not really my style of comedy. I give it 5 stars because SHE absolutely loves it!
2,Digital Copy will not work for Windows,"I love the movie; however, I purchased this version of the movie because it came with the digital copy. I tried running the digital copy in my windows computer and it told me the code was expired. I contacted the company and their response was that the digital copy is no longer available for this movie. I then tried the digital copy with Itunes and it worked. Unfortunately I no longer use an iphone and switched to android. Do not buy this version if you wish to use the digital copy with a non apple device."
4,Different that expected,"This DVD was not what I expected. I expected comedy, and it ended being very serious. Different story line. Not your typical super hero movie. Good ending."
5,I haven't cried this hard since Obama got elected,"I just got back from watching this movie in the theater an hour ago, it made me cry with laughter. I don't just want to write a synopsis of the movie that will just take the piss out of it for anyone who reads this review. But I have to say that any movie where the father puts a kevlar vest on his 11 year old daughter and shoots her 3 times in the chest with a glock to get her used to the effect is totally insane. OK, after having just written that you probably think I'm a sicko, you'll understand if you just go see the movie!"
1,The Theater Was empty Except for my nephew and me.,"Well what a disgrace this movie is.When I saw the previews I thought it was a movie with a young person doing a funny way of crime fighting.Well While sitting next to my nephew and totally sliding down in my seat,I found out this was not a movie for kids,But damn you have the father using the f word,you have the daughter using the C word for a womans anatomy,you got more blood flowing in this movie than scarface,now I know why the movie theater was empty.I asked the manager for a reund which he gave us and then said dont feel bad I have given out a lot for this movie this week.Dump this dvd in the trash.Nicolas cage must need the money bad for his taxes.If you get the blu ray combo for 7.50 at Walmart buy it just to see how bad a movie can be."
5,I Love the Bluray Version!!!!,"Bought the Bluray version, put the digital copy on my iphone, gave the DVD to my sister cuz she like the movie too and i kept the Bluray version. The movie i think is one of the best action hero movie at that time, very refreshing. Hit girl did a awesome job on this film."
4,Better the second time around,"It has been awhile since I saw kickass the first time when it first came out, and it was better than I remembered. I haven't seen an action comedy blended so well without it being one more than the other and this movie gives the viewer a healthy dose of both."
5,Great Movie...Super Price,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it. When I noticed that it was so inexpensive to buy, I just had to have it. If you like Nicolas Cage and action, then you must own it!"
3,Hit-Girl stole the show!,"Apparently based on an actual comic book, it's about a kid who wants to be a super hero. Until he doesn't. A really well paced, fun, funny, and somewhat thought provoking smaller but well done movie. Kind of a ""I didn't see THAT coming' movie! Only cast member I recognized was Nick Cage, but they were all good and Hit-Girl stole the show."
2,"good movie, bad delivery system","I rented this movie for my ROKU digital watcher from The Amazon video store. the picture came over fine and I would have enjoyed the story, but my system had to stop just about every three or four minutes and reload the movie. In all, it took over three hours to watch a two hour movie. I don't think that I'll be renting very many movies from this source, if any. I do not have this problem when I watch Netflix instant movies."
4,everyman's hero,Sort of a coming-of-age story for the every day guy who is mildly suffering from delusion. The part of the young girl was a nice touch.
3,Pretty good - almost 4 stars,I felt like this was pretty good overall but I also felt like there could have been a lot more done with it. I was entertained but not riveted. And I love Nicolas Cage
2,Just the Facts Ma'am.,"A highly informative book about viruses, how and why they are spread, in some cases their epidemiology and much about their evolution. Thankfully, very little is given over to speculation here, at least as compared to other books I've read on the subject. The information in this book is offered in a completely straightforward (and sometimes very boring) way. You will learn some fascinating new facts, but not have to suffer through scare tactics, just a yawn or two. The book put me to sleep a few times, but was still worth the read. The book contains some interesting viral history and global implications to ponder as well. No entertainment here though, it's just the facts."
4,Overall a very good and interesting read,"This book, unlike others such as ""Hot Zone"" presents a factual account from an outsiders point of view on the emerging, the new and the ancient diseases that afflict mankind. This book does not seek to scare the hell out of people yet still achieves this by documenting outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola, Hantaviruses and writes accounts of HIV, AIDS and some of the ancient afflictions such as Bubonic plague and tuberculosis. This book is an excellent read and I only gave it four stars because of the fact that some of the ideas were not clearly set out and some bits were a little muddled"
1,typical,"Jordan joins the clan of blues bandwagoners as member emeritus. These poems are just plain, throwbacks from the (great and sufficient) protest poetry of the past. ...dispense with this treatise."
1,Great album from big-haired wannabee,"This album is among lyle's worst. The arrangements are all plodding and unimaginative. The musicians sound bored. Lyle is at his most pathetic and whiny. Listen, if ANY of the original Texas blues artists heard this guy singing like this and claiming to be from Texas, they would have shot him on the spot (not that I'm advocating violence, but they were a different breed). Fortunately (for Lyle) they've passed on. Its really Brittany Spears for a little more sophisticated crowd. Great for people with a lot of money who drive Subaru Foresters, wear Birkenstocks, SmartWool socks, listen to A Prarie Home Companion, and love nice safe unchallenging music."
3,Lyle in Love?,"I first thought of this as ""Lyle in love"" due to the Julia connection and tried to write off the weakness of the material to distraction, but 5 of the songs date from an earlier period so I now feel maybe this CD just needed a more judicious editing. There are still standouts like, ""Skinny Legs"" and ""Sonja"" but the repititious lyrics of ""Ain't it Somethin'"" and ""Penguins"" make the CD a little more annoying with each listen. Far from his best but Lyle is always worth a listen."
5,Trico Wiper Blade,The Trico 10 - 1 is the EXACT fit Wiper Blade for my back window..I will buy this product for my window again..It was a good buy..
5,Best mouse out there (if you can actually find one!)...,"I have this mouse for my main home computer and love it. The fit of the mouse is the best I've felt compared to all the mice I've owned. It is a very ergonomic mouse and responds very well due to the optical mouse technology instead of outdated mouseball technology. The buttons really feel like they respond when you click them. I love using this mouse for my everyday web surfing, for gaming, and for work. It is not that expensive, either. I bought mine for only about $30, and it is worth every penny. The only problem is that this mouse is hard to find these days. You may have to resort to looking for it at online shops. You can try your luck at Best Buy, Circuit City and other big electronics stores, but it seems like they don't carry this one anymore since Logitech has a wireless MouseMan that has replaced it. :("
3,Clunky,"We bought this as a replacement for the cheap-o mouse our PC came with.Although I like not having to worry about cleaning a mouse ball, I still don't particularly care for this mouse.I am right handed, altough I can see how this mouse can cause problems for left-handed persons. It is a very thick mouse, with a slant to the right. A left handed user may find this mouse difficult to use.The main reason I don't like this mouse it that it's too big. I don't know who they made this thing for, but my hand does not fit very comfortably on the mouse. My mother and sister have much smaller hands, so they find this thing even more difficult to use.Personally, I prefer the good, old (going on 3 years), omni-hand design Logitech track ball mouse I have on my laptop."
4,Very Good,"This is a very good mouse overall. It glows, which was a nice surprise, but I don't find that it heats up at all. It fits your hand nicely, and the 3rd button is easily accesible but can not be pushed accidentally. I find the 3rd button is most useful when you set it to execute the back function of your browser. Sometimes, however, for no apparent reason the pointer sticks in one space or moves around on its own. Other than that, it is an nice mouse."
1,jimmie johnson stadium seat,"Everything would have been great. Except when we recieved the chairs, the print was upside down. I contacted customer service and they arranged to send me two new chairs. The chairs arrived and the print was upside down on those chairs too! I then again contacted customer service. They pretty much called me a liar. Nothing was done. So, apparently when they send out their product, they don't check for quality. Great product. NOT!!"
1,A book that is a waste of time.,"This book proved a great disappointment. It contains nothing new, and completely fails to interpret either Daniel or Revelation. The author comes across as blinkered, bigotted and arrogant - a self-satisfied member of the 'elite' who gives the impression he will spend eternity smirking from his guaranteed high place in heaven at the rest of us, who will presumably be burning in hell! He is mistaken in thinking Daniel and Revelation only have any meaning for the present generation - didn't they have any meaning to those for whom they were originally written? His theology appears limited and narrow-minded. Don't waste your money on this book. A more scholarly and balanced view of eschatology is given in Craig C. Hill's book 'In God's Time'."
5,Magnum PI Tv series on dvd,I have all of the seaons now. This was one of my favorite shows while it was playing in the 80's. I am glad that they put them all on dvd so I can watch them anytime I want to
4,Love it.,These series bring back lots of memories. My wife and I miss these kinds of interactions in TV. Great characters.
2,MAGNUM PI SERIES,BIG FAN OF THE SHOW. NOT A BIG FAN OF THE DVD'S FOR CUSTOMER WATCHING. ONLY THE 1ST SEASON AND LAST WE'RE GOOD QUALITY. THE TWEEN SEASONS CRAPPY QUALITY. HAD TO RETURN SEASON 2-7 BECAUSE OF UNWATCHABLE DISKS.
4,The album description says it better than I can.,"All I can say is that IMHO it lives up to the description. Although I have enjoyed music from the lounge genre, I might not have purchased this CD had I stumbled on it here at amazon, especially if no one had reviewed it. I heard it playing in a music store and bought it after hearing a couple of cuts. If what you hear in the samples appeals to you, take the plunge. If you were born after 1960 and/or think this might be 'techno' lounge or trance, you will probably not be happy with it."
5,A Real Eye Opener,"I bought this video on VHS back in the 90's and was amazed.If you drive or don't even own a vehicle, everyone should view this video.All teenage drivers should be required to watch this prior to gettinga drivers license. This show will open your eyes to the danger that trains can be,,they must be respected.The DVD content is exactly the same as the VHS and the quality is superb.A must have!"
3,Somewhat disappointing - not worth the money,"I remembered this series fondly, and I was excited when I sawit for sale. However, it doesn't stand the test of time. EdwardPetherbridge (of the later series) is a much better Wimsey than Ian Carmichael, and the other production values don't hold up well. Also be warned that although there are 5 cassettes in the package, there is only one 50 minute episode on each. Considering all of this, I find it very over-priced... I enjoyed seeing it once, but I regret buying it."
4,not strong as Waldman trio usually ...,"Named on Bromberg , this is the standard Waldman , Colaiuta , Bromberg trio , playing well but not so greatly as usual 'cause , in my opinion , of the bass record impo. of the record , meaning of the mixdown , solo space and so on .Anyway wort enough to buy it , pheraps not at import price ...."
4,Well ! Could be better,I dont know its kind of cool but i expected more from it but its very good book
4,"The One, The Only ... Daffy Duck","After enjoying someEssential Daffy DuckDVD, I bought the Daffy Duck version. The first disc contains previously released shorts, and the second disc contains a few unreleased shorts and specials. I have never seen Daffy Duck's Easter Special.

2,2 stars out of 5 = 40% = F . . .,"In short, save your money. I recently borrowed this book from a friend and was very disappointed. Though I hate to be so severe, I think that Newark is a weak writer. Her own comments, which appear in a following review, illustrate this point. First, she didn't even click on the ""I Am the Author"" link (yeah). In addition, she raves about some professor's comment regarding this novel: ""Jane would be proud of you."" Then, Newark declares: ""I intend of have those words engraved on my tombstone."" Well, I ""intend of"" ask you not to buy this book. Newark also says: ""The next reviewer claims to be a member of the Jane Austen Society, but she chooses to be anonymous. No true Jane Austen reader would hide her identity."" How does Newark know that a woman wrote the previous review? There are men who love Austen's work, too. Furthermore, I have a hard time believing that Newark belongs to the Jane Austen Society. No true Jane Austen reader would ever have written this book."
3,A light-hearted visit to Austen country,"The subtitle of this novel is ""A gentle, Jane Austen-style joke,"" and it provides an appropriate lens through which to view this charming short novel. The characters -- chiefly the mature Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet, and Mr. Darcy, as well as Charlotte's daughter Eliza and Elizabeth and Darcy's son Henry -- are nicely imagined and true to Austen. The author touches on how the Austen's characters and their children would respond to the intellectual climate of the early Victorian era, which adds interest to the story. Newark's playful references to characters from other Austen novels may not suit everyone's taste, but will likely amuse others who share her fondness for all of Austen's characters."
4,Enjoyable,"I was excited to read this book and was very disappointed in the length of it. I did enjoy the story and felt it was a probable continuation of Pride and Predjudice. I would have liked for the relationships between the characters, particularly the younger characters, to be spelt out more. Also the use of all the names from other Jane Austen novels was a bit confusing. I would recommend it to anyone who reads Jane Austen novels and enjoys her work."
2,I regret I bought it,"As a big Poirot and David Souchet fan, I own every Poirot tape and DVD available. The lowest rating I'd ever give any of them is four stars and most of them would get a five star rating from me. But not so with this one. I found this movie to be disappointing for several reasons. First, and foremost, the movie is littered with many cuts featuring a mouse. A mouse running. A mouse eating. A mouse by a body, etc. There must be literally twenty or thirty shots of the mouse. The shots are distasteful, annoying and unrelated to the story line. Second, the show doesn't include Captain Hastings. Its not the same show without him. The basic story line was a good one. Had they thrown out the mice and thrown in Hastings, it would probably have gotten a 5 star rating from me."
5,Get this when Installing Sound Dampening in Car!!,I used this with my eDead that I purchased from Amazon also. It helps you get into those corners and crevises that you normally couldn't get too. You don't have to buy it but it makes the install much easier & smoother. You can use the handle end as well to get in those corners that the roller can't get too.
4,morks great,This roller has the semi hard roller and it works well and doesn't tear the foil on the dynamat material
4,Basic Roller,Used to install dynamat in a 2001 GMC jimmy. This medium soft roller helped to ensure that the adhesive was well pressed onto the door panel. You might be able to find a small roller at a local hardware store for a bit less but overall I was satisfied with purchasing through Amazon along with the dynamat.
5,"It is what it is, and does what it says.","If you are installing a bunch of Dynamat in your vehicle, this roller is pretty handy. It helps flatten out wrinkles, seal the seams, and fit all the funky bumps, lumps, contours and corners for a good clean fit. The roller seems fairly well made and will probably last you several projects.If you are only doing a small section or piece, this roller probably isn't a must."
1,Too big and too fragile,"Although the plastic feels high-grade, within 10 minutes a leg joint was broken. Since the leg gave way, it kept falling until a wing joint broke as well. To be honest, even if it hadn't broken, the Balroq still would have moved into the basement. This isn't a toy. It's a statue. It's too big for any child to play with."
4,Full days of disc golf jsut got easier,A full size disc golf bag is much easier to carry around as a backpack rather than a single strap. After disc golfing for 11 years. My back thanks this product.
3,Fairy Houses,"I was a little disappointed in this book because I thought it would be more of a ""how to build"" them. There are some great photographs that can be used as inspiration, but if you are looking for a how to book, this isn't for you."
1,Are you going to ship this?,"I bought this awhile ago for an xmas present and its sitting in my orders unshipped, I have no way to contact you about this."
4,Works great,The product worked exactly like it said it would. It lets in plenty of light but now strangers at my front door can't stare in at me. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was because static cling is inheirently tricky to work with.
1,Wear gloves when installing!!!,"Installed this light and the bulb sliced my thumb open due to a razor sharp piece of glass on the edge where the glass top meets the body of the bulb. Clearly a manufacturing defect. Never buying this product again, I'm just going to buy a standard floodlight."
5,It took me 4 months to finally recieve this book but...,"It was worth the wait. I'm not that far into it yet but I'm already seeing how closed off I've been to seeing what's around me. I'm positive that by time I'm done with the book it will have made me a better seer, maybe not a better photographer, but I will see things in new and exciting ways. I don't recommend this book to people who want to get better at technical aspects of photography. However, if you feel like you don't always take the best pictures you could because you aren't seeing whats around you than this book is for you.Note: This is NOT a book about composition! Some reviewers are complaining about how poorly he covers the subject. This book is about teaching you how to see differently! If you want a book on composition by all means do not look to this book. If you want to start seeing things that others might not, this is the only book of it's kind!"
1,Disappointing,"I knew that I wasn't going to like this book after 2 minutes of flipping through the photos. They are mediocre at best. Not one inspiring shot in the entire book! And the advice is useless.Skip this book and buy ""The Simple Secret to Better Painting: How to Immediately Improve Your Work With the Golden Rule of Design"" by Greg Albert. And don't be fooled by the word ""painting"" in the title. This is a book about composition and it will help make you a better photographer."
5,Great Book,"This book has beautiful pictures with some technical explanations. It doesn't go into very technical details such as camera settings. It gives just enough technical info to let you try it out. The approach to photography here is very impressionistic. Shoot on how you feel, what the object conveys to you. This book takes you on a journey down photography sideways. Real eye opener. I would definitely recommend this book to those who don't like memorizing lots of rules, settings."
4,Had to lengthen,"The cable does what it says, it's nicely built and very sturdy. It wasn't long enough for what I needed though, you really only get 3 good feet before you have to bolt your camera and flash down. I had to lengthen mine (don't wanna explain here, it voids the warranty).Overall, very good, rugged, sturdy product."
4,An insightful and refreshing book,"While I'm admittedly not in what the author declares as the intended audience of the book, I've still found it to be very insightful. The intended audience being those who have invested significantly in training for and carrying out a career in a specific field and are now considering switching. As a current member of the military who intends to move into the business world after 5 years, I was refreshed by the author's encouragement to explore potential selves instead of locking yourself into what you ""should"" do based on the results of some introspection or a personality test."
3,Not terribly encouraging....,"I read this book shortly after my son, who has DS, was born. Maybe I should have waited a while! I found it kind of grim and frightening. It does contain lots of good medical advice, but I think that perhaps Karen Stray Gunderson's book is the best book to start reading. I also like the Pueschel book. Perhaps because these individuals have children with DS, whereas Cliff Cunningham does not, the books are written in a more sensitive fashion. As a new parent just learning about DS, we need encouragement!"
5,"Lyrical, beautiful urban fantasy","I love Charles de Lint's brand of urban fantasy, the lyricism of his writing, the way he takes the ordinary and banal and adds just a touch of magic and enchantment, transforming it. This short story collection is a good introduction to his fictional town of Newford, where many of his stories and novels take place. These stories range from the beautiful to the horrific; and, unlike most story collections, I didn't feel like they were disjointed or unconnected. There was some kind of unifying force behind them all, so that, together like this, their collective force tells some kind of greater, larger story than any of them do seperately. I was entranced. Give this book a shot; I doubt you'll regret it."
3,80's version of horror spoof,"If you like the ""Scary Movie"" spoofs of ""Scream"" and other horror films and are a George Clooney fan, you'll like ""Return of the Killer Tomatoes."" It is good for when you want to watch a movie and want to laugh out loud. The companion piece ""Return to Horror High"" was too campy and was not good"
3,Tomatoes Is Great Fun....Horror High is pretty dull but has its moments.,"Killer Tomatoes holds up really well. Funny and off the wall, especially the great John Astin. Return to Horror High has lost most of it's punch, except for the early demise of George Clooney (boy...if they'd only known!) and the ending and of course the inclusion of Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!. The pace is horribly slow. There is one thing that they included as a joke, when the crew runs out of money, they make hilarious use of 'product placement"" to make up the shortfall. Boy were they prophetic!!!!!!. Last but not least, Alex Rocco, is the quintessential slimey ""B"" movie producer!"
4,A Realistic View of an Individual's Magickal Training,"I found the previous reviewer's note on the fact that you can't have to much going on in your life to get the full benefit of this book, to be very accurate.When I read this book while thoughts of what I had to do in the mundane life were swimming around in my head, made me feel like the book was going nowhere.It wasn't until things in my life settled down that this book really made it's impact.I think it is a great book! There are no Hollywood versions of what magick should look like. No shooting fireworks from the fingertips right away. As who can do this when they are brand new at magick?I could really identify with the character. At times I thought the author must have met me because I thought I was the only person that was that confused about my destiny and how to find out who I really am!I can't wait till the next one and I highly recommend the book to anyone starting their journey or needing to tweak up their skills."
2,Unfortunately we all get old,"Read several of the reviews. Some praise Dame Joan for her singing. I'm with those that can't see it. Compare her to the powerful voice of Tonio. Even Sulpice's gentle efforts. Dame Joan might have had a voice and acting ability once, but compared to the others that have recorded this part - sorry - you've wasted your money. The marchioness and duchess were great in their comic parts. The chorus did it's job. But Marie can be done so much better. Better acting - very definitely. Better singing technique - well maybe it wasn't too bad. But voice - sorry, sorry, sorry."
2,Not Far Enough Off Broadway,"Perhaps no production of La Fille could make me enjoy the shallow music. Please don't get me wrong. I love bel canto and I have enjoyed many evenings of Donizetti, but this opera is just too bumptious for me. The genesis of the bouncy Broadway musical is too apparent. So I admit I'm prejudiced. However, THIS production seems gratuitously silly. Every chance to make the music sound oompah corny is exploited. There are more than a few tuning problems spread generously among the singers, and voice timbres are harsh throughout, more bellow canto than bel canto. Reading the other amazon reviews, I find myself agreeing with most of the faults noted and few of the virtues.To offer something positive: if you want to see and hear a successful comic opera in the bel canto style, you might choose Rossini's ""Le Comte Ory"", which is available on DVD. Silliness can be delightful when the music isn't sacrificed."
4,"A haunting, memorable album -","I used to have a copy of this on tape and played it to death. I loved the music's obscurity and the fact that once you heard it, you never forgot the music. The soundtrack was by far the best thing that ever came out of this movie. It is well worth owning."
5,20 of his best!!!!!!!!!!!!!,every song on this cd is great from begining to end it is non stop hits so i give it a five star rating (who would'nt?)
3,Not HDCD!,"While this is a decent enough recoding, I bought it because I have an HDCD player and so little rock is available in this format. The ""oversampling"" light comes on, but not the ""HDCD"" decode light. If you already have theses songs (and what Hendrix fan doesn't) this will be a waste of money."
3,Pretty Good,"The animation could be better but the over-the-top fight scenes, that are a trademark of this series, make this tape a worthwhile diversion."
3,Greatest Hits by Tom Petty & Heartbreakers,"Greatest Hits by Tom Petty & HeartbreakersWorth having. TP and the Heartbreakers' music is standard fare for your library of Rock. Petty writes good music, if not great, he'll be included in my library and listening."
5,The Petty Party I wanted,"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers / Greatest Hits (2008): The 18 tracks on this CD has everything I want in a Petty hits CD (although his participation in the Traveling Wilburys is not to be missed, and you have to get those CDs separately). The Heartbreakers scattered output is excellently gathered here and that makes this a Five Star hits CD."
1,One psychotic toothbrush!,"Well, the Braun Oral-B ""AdvancePower"" brush worked fine for the first several months as an inexpensive alternative to the Sonicare, but after that I suffered from the same problem as another customer--that is, the power wouldn't go off even when you press the power button! AAARGHHHH!! Because of that, you'd have to rinse the brush while it's still vibrating, then carefully return it to its rechargeable holder so as not to splash moisture from the brush on the wall or mirror. Once in its rechargeable holder, the brush will finally turn off, phew! On the bright side, you can use it as a power outage detector: whenever the power goes out, the toothbrush will turn on--and stay on--until the charge runs out or power is restored, whichever comes first. Sure it's cheap, but why put up with such hassles? Says me, spend a little more and get something that works and doesn't have the alter-ego of Chucky."
2,It had such potential!,"I like this author and was intrigued when I leafed through the book. It's a story about a woman and the men in her life. But, the book never really got going. Rather disappointing."
1,PANASONIC RQ-CR18V,"I had two major problems with this device and had to return it:1. Volume level far too low, even when set to max (perhaps due to AVLS?).2. Radio untuneable. There are 2 buttons for digital tuning - up and down - which when pressed make a loud irritating continuous beeping and mute the radio. You have to release these buttons to hear what you've tuned to - which of course is usually nothing as you can't hear the radio while tuning. There's no problem if you already know the exact frequency you want. If you don't, tuning is very tedious. The beep cannot be muted or turned down. There is no autoscan or autotune.By Panasonic standards I regard this as unacceptable and would be very sceptical about buying another Panasonic product."
3,white lies,As usual it starts out promising but ultimately falls short. Anything dealing with racial issues in our society is always slanted against white people.Of course the hero is a white female who joins a white power group.This is unrealistic to begin with.Most white females in our society are unopinionated or out right antagonistic to white heritage/identity.The villains are nazis of course.The 3rd reich is more hated in our culture than satan and even less tolerated.Not many females would join a movement so unpopular or so unpopculture!White power groups tend to be the domain of working class white males who feel left out of society without a voice.Females are treated differently and are generally more excepted by nonwhites and therefore don't tend to gravitate toward those beliefs and/or movements.This movie has its good points but is overdone and full of exaggerated realism.
5,Steaming!,"Absolutely great live recording by Joe Ely and his fine band. At the time this was recorded and released in the early 80s, Joe Ely was in a difficult position: he was considered too country for the rockers, and too loud and rocky for the country establishment. But anyone with an ear for quality, passionate music could not be fail to be moved --- and excited --- by these powerful, lively performances. One of the best live albums of all time? I'd agree with that statement. I'd put it in the Top 20 for sure. Commanding performance from a talented band, along with brilliant songs by Ely. The result is a sizzling show."
2,Origin a little suspicious,I received this and although it has all the official Nike logo on it I am a little suspicious regarding it's origin. The instructions were nothing more than a copy and there was a lack of the usual Nike material and logo.
2,"Buy it, but close your eyes when you watch it.","I agree with everything the next viewer(dated May 31, 02)said about this DVD. I like Tchaikovsky's operas. I expected to see something Russian, but I was very disappointed. The stage design and the costume looked awlful. Only the Onegin character makes the DVD worth buying. Fat Tosca is okay, but not a Fat Tatiyana. The VHS version with Yuri Marusin and Sergei Leyferkus is definitely the 1st choice. It should be issued on DVD."
2,Not bad but all the other versions are better,"I bought this DVD because it was so highly rated. It doens't deserve 4 stars! Not even three! The first act is pretty awful. It's so abstract and overdone. It gives you no feeling of a Russian countryside. It looks ""POP"". Olga is childish instead of youthful, Tatiana is fat (could be a beautiful lady if she loses some weight), Nya-nya is a big healthy maid. But Onegin is a real handsome guy. Maybe that's the only highlight of the whole opera.Among all the other productions, my first choice is the live performance from Kirov with Yuri Marusin and Sergei Leyferkus. Tatiana (I don't recall the singer's name)is a rare beauty. She looks totally in role. I can't imagine anyone better than her. Only available on VHS, though. Too bad."
1,great music spoiled by amateurish mastering,"This DVD contains wonderful singing, the orchestra playing is excellent, and the acting is superb. So why the 1 star? Because whoever prepared the transfer master was utterly incompetent. The indexing in the booklet and via the screen menus is completely wrong. For example if you try to start the beginning of Act II, it puts you in the middle of Act I. There is not the slightest pause between the acts. However, before the duel scene, there is a horrible glitch with a fraction of a second of sound during a screen blackout.It's disgraceful that a major label would put this out; since clearly no one even bothered to check it.If they ever fix these problems, I'd give it a full 5 stars!"
3,"Found it interesting, but disagreed with a lot of it","I approached this book with great eagerness, and by the time I was finished, I loved some aspects of it and hated others. The writing was excellent, the description well done. Janet Rochester was a sympathetic character. But I hated the Jane Eyre of this book. I can't believe that the warm and loving Jane Eyre, who so warmly embraced Adele (Rochester's possible illegitimate daughter) would have held her own daughter at arm's length for reasons as petty as jealousy or insecurity. This Jane Eyre was so cold it took time on a tropical island to get her to be loving with her daughter-a little far-fetched. I cannot imagine her being anything but totally loving with any children of hers fathered by Rochester. I was also very disturbed by the incestuous overtones of Janet's thoughts about her father. I thought it was inappropriate. The whole Rochester family seemed a tad Freudian to me, not the loving family I envisioned."
3,Has good points and bad. . . .,"I read this after reading ""Thornfield Hall"" so that might have colored my view. ""Thornfield Hall"" is not worth the time it took to read it, so I was hoping this one would be better. It is in many ways; however I was somewhat disappointed in the author's treatment of Jane Eyre. She is cold and unloving toward her daughter and I don't believe the ""real"" Jane would have been this way. Otherwise, it is a good mystery story. I found myself distancing this story from the original and thinking of it as a totally separate story which just happened to have some familiar names."
4,Almost like being there?,"I enjoy this CD. I find the technical qualities of the recording to be quite good. IT is a live recording and not a studio recording. That being said, I can her Ms. Dibranco and the Carnegie Hall acoustics loud and clear, as well as the audience. IMO, the technical detail is as said quite good; perhaps could have been better, but I am satisfied (in contrast to many other live recordings). Ms Difranco tends to ramble on at times with her political thoughts or observations or stories or poetry; you either like this or you do not. For me, her music is so wonderful, I can ""tolerate"" a great deal of dialogue (which was not why I purchased this ""music"" CD). For ADF fans, well recommended."
1,"Save Your Money, Go Buy Someone Else's CD","She is overated and has a lousy voice. The lyrics are way too self indulgent and will never make it on the Top 40 charts. Her guitar playing is OK. I find her songs boring and just goes on and on for nothing. She said she doesn't want to get signed. Who cares? No major label will deal with her lousy lyrics and are so self indulgent. Besides, major labels want artist that sell millions on a release. I doubt she'll ever match the single album sales figures of Avril Lavrgne or Kelly Clarkson. Besides, her singing is inferior compared to them."
3,"Great Sound, cheap plastic breaks","I love the sound, and noise cancelling of these phones. But, one day they just broke in two pieces, and shorted out. Tape wouldn't even work. This was frustrating for the price I paid."
2,Way overpriced,Like jsut about everything else Bose sells these are way overpriced. The Sennheiser PCX250's sound much better and cost less than half as much.
1,Plastic hinge broke off after 3 years of light use,"I used these during my business trips and initially was very happy with them and their performance (noise cancelling only, since I don't use these to listen to music at all). But cannot say the same after 3 years (of periodic/light usage), since the plastic at the point where the earcups link up, has completely broken away, on one of the sides, rendering the whole unit useless.The plastic used in these $300 headphones, seems to be very cheap/non-pliable stuff and I have no idea why it did not break off sooner. Either way, it is now out of warranty and I would like to know if this problem is more pervasive, before buying Bose again."
3,Bose QuietComfort 2,"On a recent plane ride, it only blocked out about half of the noise. Needless to say, I was disappointed that it didn't block out more."
2,"Bought headphones used, broke in 5 months","I bought these headphones used but ""like new"" from EZCORP. There was a buzzing noise which gradually got worse and is now an extremely loud screeching noise and the headphones are unusable. When they were not broken, I thought they were great headphones. The music sounded great and all the white noise was cancelled, even though you could still hear people talking, and the sound of typing. I've tried to contact the seller 4 times about this problem but have gotten only automated responses."
2,"Waste of money , Avoid","What good are head phones when they are cheap plastic. I've had these for 9 months and now they are in the trash. The left ear piece has completly broken off. They part that holds the speakers is made of plastic and is very cheap. For $300 I expect a lot more.The sound quality is good. I would not say the sound is great. I found the mid range to be muted and the bass was without definition. Again, for $300 I expect more. I'm disappointed with Bose and will never buy Bose headphones again and probably any Bose product will be off my list.Bose is a has been company living off it's passed rep and now ripping off customers with cheap plastic junk. Avoid these headphones!"
2,Performace yes - value no - product support no,"Received the first generation of these a couple of years ago and have generally been pleased with the performance. Have used them for flying and also great hooked up to an MP3 player/FM radio for mowing grass & blowing snow on the tractor. When the ear cushions fell apart I was disappointed to learn that they wanted $35 for a $1 item. As for the headband cushion that had also fallen apart, there is no replacement but I can ""trade up"" for only $100. They also won't pre-ship the replacement - you must send the old product to them first and do without until they get around to shipping the replacement. Most retailers nowadays will send a replacement first with a pre-printed label for the return so you can re-use the shipping box. I'm disappointed in this level of support for a supposedly premium product. Get with it Bose - you owe your customers more for what you charge. I'll be looking at other brands."
1,Better stuff out there for $300,"with regards to sound, this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good ---- unfortunately, the 'phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Sony MDR NC20, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of the Sony's and you'll fall in love!"
2,"Wal-Mart quality, Parisian price.","I bought my Bose noise-canceling headphones about three years ago. They rate four-and-one half-stars for noise-canceling. However, they're now held together with library tape. The headphone quality:cheap plastic [...]. Maybe Bose should give a free roll of duct tape, instead of a free CD player, with these 'phones.I'd upgrade my review to five stars if I could. Bose gave my a pair of their new, seemingly more sturdy headphones for $[...], in exchange for my old, falling-apart pair. I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! Noise of ANY kind really bothers me, so these were an essential purchase for me. Studies have shown (really!) that overhead aircraft noise lowers students' test results. Noise stresses out most everyone. So, less stress for $[...]. Yeah, a lot of money. But they're the best out there. Just think how much you pay for health care. $[...] is like a like a quarter in the health care industry."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I wasn't sure what I was thinking when I bought these headphones??? Maybe being a BOSE product, I expected an out of body experience or something but that never happened. $300!!! They're not worth that money unless you get excited over a nice fancy case and a few adapters! I've tried many headphones that are MUCH LESS in cost and some of them are just as good as the BOSE. Plus, whoever needed a battery for headphones to work? I find myself forgetting to turn it off and if you don't it will just stay on and when the battery is low, you get all kind of crackling and the power shuts off and on!Don't get me wrong, with a fresh battery, they do sound very good but they are not worth $300!So, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Totally Disappointed,I was very surprised to find that the Bose headphone that I recently bought simply doesn't work. It's so frustrating and I am not sure if I should just send it back to the factory or take it to some Bose store in the mall. You don't expect this kind of failure in a headphone these days.
3,A slick and polished adventure story,"Geordie is sent to Kamanga in Africa by the SAS to bolster the local government army by training their select Alpha Commando. But soon it becomes clear that Alpha is preparing for a particular operation: an attack on Gutu, a diamond mine in the south of the country captured by rebel forces the previous year. It is in planning this that they needed the SAS's help although the team's orders were to act as advisers only and not to get involved in any fighting.Things take on a dramatic turn when the team accidentally run into a group of children killing a ten year old boy. So when the local sin'ganga - the witch doctor - predicts that ten men will die to repay the boy's every year of life, the SAS team start to feel distinctly uneasy...The book is nicely read by David Tarkenter for ISIS Publishing."
1,You probably already have this in your Medicin Cabinet,Don't let the name fool you as it did me. This product is simply 1% hydro cortisone cream hardly worth $10 w/ shipping
2,Disappointing,"More than the title is a misnomer, but its fits after you start to read the novel. My opinion of the book plummets with each page, as I like the main characters less and less. There are some beautifully written segments, but there are too many problems overall. The setting is of very little importance, it could be nearly anywhere in Eastern Europe in 1990. One by one the main characters are discarded until the last one is tossed off the pages. Some of the character's are briefly interesting, like John, while others, like Scott never make it even that far. I don't think i would recommend this book to anyone."
1,No No No,"A little like a trip to the dentist. You know you have to do it, you know it must get better, but it never does."
1,Sarcastic garbage . . .,"Being a sucker for comparisons, I bought this book when the author was called the new Fitzgerald. Sadly, this is not the case. Sarcasm is the lowest form of humor and this is the foundation on which this miserable book rests.Miserable characters unable to connect in a story told by a voice that is equally spiteful of life. The characters are in no way sympathetic, just pathetic. Their conversations are of no interests to anyone, but the writer.A true chore to read."
1,S-l-o-w...,"Il tedioso, nothing original, occasional (VERY occoasional) flashes of good prose fail to save this lumbering snore-inducer. Where is Maxwell Perkins when we need him? One star (just) for being nice to Vietnam veterans"
4,need to reread....but!,"first time reading phillips.I had some problems at first keeping track of the characters and especiallly the Horvath Printing Press section. Normally i am not one prone to re-read a just finished book( 8 Mth's ago ) but i have to say this book is better than most literature out there today, and it's obvious Phillips is trying to create his own take on exp's, that all writers have been trying to capture since the likes of Hem,..and Fitz.I have yet to read this book again..but i can't stop thinking I missed too much the first time. The middle part of the book can be a little sluggish ...but persevere..it gets beeter .. Phillips definitely wraps up all loose ends, bringing the book and characters together for a closing.Honestly I can't wait to read it again and gain some insight on what I missed"
4,Good read.,Great book - especially if you have ever experienced life abroad for more than a 10 day vacation or a semester 'faux-living-abroad'. Phillips has a great sense of humor and captured many of the darker aspects of life that we all subconsciously can relate to.Loved the Julies. Who doesn't know people like the Julies?!
2,Potential to be better,"This debut novel by Arthur Phillips has tinges of some good writing, as he weaves a tale of expatriates living in Budapest.In the end though the characters are dull, uninteresting, and just flat out 'whiney' and irritating. I could not care for any of them or what would happen to them. Phillip's manages to write well at times, but I could not feel involved for these spoiled kids who were just in the prime of their adult youth in an exciting place. At that time in my life I would have killed to been where they were at the time.Also one of the only interesting and well written characters is hardly in the book at all, and that was John's editor at the newspaper. I was actually hoping to hear more from him but he was rarely used in the story.In a way this is a good first effort, but I think Phillp's just needs to write about something else. The title for this book is really misleading as well, and would better be served naming it Budapest."
1,Worse than a bad Mexican soap opera - zero stars,"Ever watched one of those really poorly done Mexican soap operas? This was just that painful. I was really looking forward to this book as my family is Hungarian. I know all of the locations in the book and thought it would be enjoyable to visit them again, though in print. It was not. This book was garbage from beginning to end. There was not a single character I cared one bit about. Kept expecting it would get better, but it never did. What a terrible disappointment of a hyped up book. Pity is wasn't available at my library, as I had to spend the money on Phillips'junk. this was my book group book for the month. We all try not to discuss how we are liking a book during the month, and to wait until our meeting. We met last night and the was NOT ONE person who didn't agree this was the worst book ever."
2,"Good Start, Horrid Middle","Prague comes in the form of four main chapters. The first one is passable: it's a reasonably clever, amusuing introduction to five characters not nearly as quirky or likeable as they could be, but they seem to be fairly good company. And of course, the promise of Prague looms throughout. The five drink and make merry and alterately scoff at and support each other in the backdrop of 1990, which Pillips reminds us ad nauseam as being a particuarly oppressive time.The second chapter, however, digresses (and, yes, it's far too early for a digression in a story that hasn't even established what it's about yet) about a family-run publishing company that spans 100 years of Budapest. I know it's an allegroy/metaphor/etc., but it's a god-awful dreary one, and it undermines any appeal that the characters built up in the first place.It falters at that point and never recovers."
2,some good parts,"While not worth reading it has a few cool parts, especially if you spent your post-college days in Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Unfortunately, this book is way too long. Honestly it would be great if it were 1/10 as long."
2,VERY HEAVY AND SCRATCHES EASILY,Pretty pattern to match the corelle square dishes but way too heavy for my taste. Would not recommend this product. It scratches easily inside as well when you use any metal utensils even serving utensils.
4,My Backup Camera,"I've been using this camera as a back up camera when I shoot events, weddings, and portraits. The funny thing is it has actually outlasted my primary camera (a Canon). This camera has been reliable and the image quality is decent. I would recommend getting a decent flash and spending some money on lenses. Overall I would recommend this camera."
2,didnt like it.,didnt inspire me to take pictures. looks dull and eh.the lens kit is a great price but thats all.
2,A bit boring and silly looking,"The pictures are a disappointment. The pictures do not hold my sons interest. He does however, enjoy putting them back in the box when I take them out. I wouldn't recommnend them at all."
4,WORTH A BUCK,"PRETTY COOL COMPILATION OF 1950'S AND 60'S MUSIC ON THIS CD, THE ONLY ONE THAT REALLY DOESN'T BELON GHERE IS BY AL JEARREAU. C'MON, THIS ONE IS LISTED AS AVAILABLE FOR ONY NINETY CENTS! IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME GOOD OLD MUSIC, THEN THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH A BUCK.........."
4,A few good songs,"I am a Buffett or a ParrotHead and listen to Radio Margaritaville about 3 or 4 times a week. The price of this was a little less than a few of the downloads so I opted for the hard copy. Some good, okay and very good songs."
2,Stupid book,"I bought this to use for couple therapy as I am a therapist, this is a stupid book with repetitive and uninteresting questions for the most part!"
5,tomorrow: Barretto live review,"This is a must have cd. I waited for years for this to be issued on cd. This is one of the greatest live performances ever recorded. The first song that catches your attention is ""Ban Ban quere,"" with Ruben Blades on lead vocals. This is New York Salsa at its best. Then comes ""Guarare,"" with Tito Gomez on lead vocals. What really stands out in this one is Alejandro ""EL Negro"" Vivar on trumpet. He throws down an unbelievable solo. Finally comes ""Que Viva la Musica,"" in this song everyone throws down on some vocals and then Tito Puente and Oretes Vilato both get down on the timbales. If you don't have this cd, buy it!"
5,Her Best Work,"""Tell Me Why"" is the best album thus far from this red headed diva. The title track is the way I like to hear her. She sounds country and not her R&B stuff which I don't care for. She is more country here than on her last couple of CDs (Revelations & The Other Side).Other standout songs here are ""Father Sun"", ""Just Like New"", ""I Just Drove By"" and ""That Was Yesterday"", which was written by the talented Naomi Judd, Wy's mother. If you want the very best Wynonna has to offer as a single artist, buy this terrific album."
4,A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY BUT A WHOLE LOT MORE,"Although considered a country superstar, Wynonna often ventured into other areas---blues, soul, pop, rock, gospel. Wynonna's unique vocal style allowed her to go beyond pure country and TELL ME WHY is evidence of that fact.The album yielded five top 10 singles including the passionately delivered IS IT OVER YET. Wynonna is a versatile singer, going from sensitive ballads to spirited rockers.My favorites: along with IS IT OVER YET, Sheryl Crow's funky FATHER SUN, the folksy I JUST DROVE BY and the infectious title track. The album has two missteps, though: the questionable inclusion of the seasonal LETS MAKE A BABY KING (although it's a good song for a Christmas album) and the trite salute to cars and Elvis in JUST LIKE NEW.Overall, TELL ME WHY is a good showcase for Ms. Judd's vocal skills."
5,Bear Naked,This is the best granola I have ever eaten. It is so fresh and the fruits are large chunks instead of little pieces. The nuts are excellent. Just wish I could find it at more stores. But that's okay. Amazon has an excellent shipping deal. (Over $25 and it is free!)
3,"Fantastic product, questionable value on Amazon","All of the Bear Naked products are great (Fruit and Nut being my favorite) but the prices on Amazon have become more and more unfavorable to the wise consumer - one 12 oz package is available for sale at my local Stop and Shop grocer for $3.99 - no waiting for shipping, either! Please support this fantastic product but purchase sensibly."
5,YUMMY!,"Quite frankly, this is comparable to the Banana Nut Crunch from Post except this is better. I look forward to the crunchy banana slices and the almonds that are hidden in this granola. Great with fat-free milk! Everyone in my family is in love with this cereal!"
1,"Amazon.com, clean up your data","This thing is not for real, or at least not legal. Amazon needs to clean up the data here!"
4,"Quick, easy, handy",I've been using this as a quick and easy way to protect my Sony VX2100 (on the front of my wide-angle lens) while filming snowboarding where the camera is constantly coming in and out of the carrying bag and where you may need to protect the lens at a moments notice. I've been very happy with it. Used in conjunction withTiffen 72mm UV Protection Filter.
5,Great fun for a toddler,My 2-year old loves this DVD. One of the few DVDs that capture his attention enough so he can happily be by himself.
3,For All the Divas In The World,"This is a great gift for for anyone claiming ""diva-status."" A silly journal filled with places for pictures (of yourself of course), an all about me section (for those of us who find ourselves facinating and worth mentioning), all about clothes, sex, men, shopping, and shallow silly incidents. This journal is a gag gift for adults, a real gift for teens, and a hoot for old farts bent on remembering their fabulous life as a diva."
2,Too small to be useful,"The dimensions do not match the description. The inner dimensions of the wire channel are about .4 x .5 inches. You will not be able to fit a coax, HDMI, or power cable in here. It can probably only fit one or two small gauge speaker wires.Spend the extra money on the C210 kit. It snaps open/closed much more nicely, and is actually large enough to be useful."
2,Not What I Expected,"These tubes are tiny, I can barely fit a single speaker wire inside. Add that to the fact there is no adhesive and I suggest you look at other options before making this purchase."
3,OK Product,They don't stick very well only last a short time before coming off this wall. I would recommend something of better quality.
3,Decent,"The product is good looking once installed and I'd recommend it to others , but please know that it is a real pain-in-the-you-know-what to clamp the clamshell together with your hands. Unless I'm doing something wrong ..."
3,Pricey but nice,Looks nice when all said and done. I could have gone for a few more corner pieces. It is expensive but then again it is for cosmetic purposed.
4,Nice product,"Used this product to run wires from our wall-mounted 32 inch LCD flat screen to the outlet/DVD player/DVI adapter for our Apple MacBook. Looks so much cleaner than cords hanging! Easy to install. Only negative is the plastic is quite rigid, so it takes some work to get thicker cords snapped into the conduit. Would be nice to have a bit more pliable plastic. But overall, great product and great deal."
4,Wire mold,"The wire mold was adequate, but is intended for thin wires like the wire on a lamp. The wire I needed to manage was an extention cord (rated for indoor use, not heavy duty) and the wire mold was a bit tight to insert the cord. Also, the sticky paper to supposedly be able to stick the mold to a flat surface was not very strong. Sometimes taming a cord requires a little bit more strength than what the adhesion on this product can handle."
4,Nice little DVD,This is not a bad DVD for the time crunched. Twenty minutes each segment.The only complaint I have is that the Sunset segment is not about winding down and relaxing. It seems just as energetic as the Sunrise. But they are both very good and together they make a nice practice.
4,Time will tell,"After being woken up two nights in a row, I did some research on long life batteries for smoke detector alarms. The best price I could find was on amazon. I have replaced the batteries in all our smoke detectors with these. Now time will tell."
3,"Two years, not ten","I bought one of these for use in a Kidde Nighthawk CO detector about two years ago. Two months ago the detector randomly started reporting ""Lo Bat"". (Took me a while to figure out what was going on because the low battery alarm only sounded for a couple of seconds once a night.)I've switched to using a standard 9V battery. While this battery may work fine in some applications, it clearly doesn't work well in everything that needs a battery backup source."
1,Dead out of the box,"Just a word of warning to test before you buy. I picked up 4 of these a couple years back so that I would have some on hand to replace the standard alkaline batteries currently in use. Now that I am replacing them, each of the 4 Ultralife batteries has been tested dead in the packaging. Stone cold, zero volts, needle does not even move, dead. They are all packaged in U9VL-X packaging with expiration dates of 2019 and 2020. The batteries are marked U9VL-J."
3,3 year 13 day battery life in my Firex dual sensor (ionization/photoelectric) smoke detector,"3 year 13 day battery life in my Firex dual sensor (ionization/photoelectric) smoke detectorIf you read the fine print in their 10 year warranty; it is valid for an ionization detector only. But since I want protection against both fast burning and slow smothering fires,I want a dual sensor.A 3 pack of Duracells are about the same price"
2,Crippled by poor sound quality and cast,I'm very disappointed with the sound quality here as there is a very noticable compression and background hiss. I did not like Doese at all. Her acting seemed contrived and was very uncomfortable throughout. Frey does his best but is not suited for this role. Doigt is good as David. McIntyre is just okay. The sets are for the most part good and the 'Dances of the prentices' scene is very well done. The Mackerras led orchestra was competent but uninspiring. I love Meistersinger but this DVD surely can't be satisfactory with that bad sound. I keep wondering when/if the Met will fill the void.
2,"great music, poorly mastered",Lots of great performances on here -- too bad the tracks are mixed and mastered soo poorly.
2,Poor Design,"I bought this level, because it appeared to be more rugged than other similarly-priced levels. I used the level to frame and immediately recognized a major flaw: the beveled edge. It is probably intended to make the edge more resilient, but it actually makes it nearly impossible to consistently scribe a plumb or level line with a pencil.It didn't take very long or many slight falls for this level to go bad. It lasted two weeks of moderate use on the job. While perceptibly thicker, the aluminum is so soft that it is more easily bent than other similarly priced yellow levels. Obviously, it doesn't compare with a Stabila, but who expects that?"
3,Extremely frustrating and at times unplayable.,"This sequel to this Game is flawed and mostly unplayable for any system. I read the Playstation 2 reviews and decided perhaps the Xbox version would not have these serious problems; I was wrong. Either no one has finished the game or its just my game, but when you get to the last few levels the game will freeze and become unplayable. If anyone out there has figured out how to fix the problem for Xbox please make it public. I hate the fact that I can not finish the game after investing so much time playing it. I was able to finish the first game which has problems to, but at least it was still playable, this game is not. The problems are so bad I don't believe Midway took the time to have game testers check it out. The flaws are impossible to miss. Buy at your own risk!"
2,"Smaller than described, arrived damaged",I'm disappointed that the actual product is only about 1 inch by 1/2 an inch enough for about two cords. The dimensions read 2 inches by 1.2 inches on the specifications. This is smaller than we had thought and now we have to improvise. We would have gone with a different product if this had been correctly advertised not to mention that the product arrived damaged with a noticeable crease in one of the pieces.
4,liked it,"I used many of them and painted them. they work great and look good but be carefull about installing them to make sure they are in the right place, because if you want a slight modification in position you will take all the paint off. great product."
2,Product does not match the picture,It's a spray can and the cologne is not as strong as it is in the glass bottle. I'm using it because it's not worth the hassle to send it back; I just won't buy from this vendor again.
2,BEWARE OF GROSSLY INFLATED REVIEWS,"I feel compelled to take a brief moment to warn review readers that this work in truth does little to enlighten anyone in any depth about the subject himself or his work.I am totally unable to account for the baseless praise heaped upon this paper weight of a biography.One can only speculate as to an explanation for such unmerited kudos. By way of comparison I note that I just finished the biography Jackson Pollock: An American Saga. Now that was an extremely well written work. The same cannot be said for this bloated and vagely informative tome that is a trial which pays no dividends.Please spare yourself the waste of your time and worthy energy. Unfortunately, I did not spare myself and persevered to the bitter end hoping beyond hope I would find some reward. I found no such thing and write this review and pray I spare atleast one person from suffering my fate. Read Pollock - a truly great and worthy work."
5,"My absolute favorite, this one goes a long way!","This is definately above the standard level for the Dragon Ball Z movies, and Cooler looks really cool in his fourth form. Anyway, my favorite part was when Goku was lying on the ground (wounded after having the... beaten out of him by Cooler), and he starts to think about his friends being killed. When a bird dies in front of him, Goku picks it up, and thus begins the coolest Super Saiyan transformation in all of DBZ history! Let's rewind a little bit before Cooler transforms. I also like the music during the brief battle between Goku and Cooler. Anyway, this is the best Dragon Ball Z movie I have ever seen! The only movie that comes close to it is Tree of Might."
4,Best DBZ movie dub out so far....,"Yes this must be one of the best Dragon Ball Z Movies Funimation has Dubed. I have to say that funimation is doing a better job because they put four languages on this dvd! I liked the movie but if you think that this movie was the best, wait there is more there are a total of 13 Dragon Ball Z movies out there only five are dubed so far. By 13 I mean only the anime ""Dragon Ball Z,"" and not the two OVAs, which I don't think will ever make it to America. But if you're a DBZ this is a must, but so are all the other movies!"
1,a fine waste of money,"DBZ, GAG! don't waste your money on anything with the title Dragon Ball Z. Go spend your money on a decent series like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop. I only gave it one star because it didn't have a zero stars option."
1,Don't trust the companies billing practices,I ordered 1 coolers revenge and was charged for two. They said I only ordered one but my account & cards clearly show two
3,Ok Yoga DVD,"I purchased this DVD a few months ago but this was the first time I actually used it. I thought the workouts looked too easy and I've never done yoga before. I was not tired at all and the instructor didn't really explain the poses at all. I wanted something that was good that would work my heartbeat up but this one didn't. However it was actually easy to do, only I had to watch their body movements to do the poses. If you want something that is relaxing this is the tape to get, otherwise it doesn't feel as a fat burning yoga at all!!"
2,Not Round at All,"The product shipped fine, but it is not for a round pool, it seems like it should be for a 18 ft oval pool. So I am getting lots of leaves on the sides where it is not covering the top of the pool. I have a lot of extra on two ends because it should be for a rectangular/oval pool. I don't know if that is the correct way as a safety precaution, but it is very messy. Not very pleased."
2,Thin cover,I have owned several solar covers over the years for the same 24' pool. This is a thin cover and I would not buy it again. I roll the cover and set it on the ledge of the pool while swimming. It is hard to roll by hand.
3,Puccini-Tosca,"Although Marton was wonderful as usual, her dynamic voice could not make up for the sound quality. There were points when the orchestra overwhelmed the artist. I suspect this was recorded as a ""whole"" versus miking the individual artists. I was reminded of home movies."
5,Amazing!,"This salt scrub is everything that I wanted it to be. It has a light scent, gently exfoliates, and actually has a calming affect when used with hot water. A small amount goes a long way, but be sure to be careful as it IS salt and salt can sting open cuts. I have sensitive skin and was a little weary about using it on my legs after shaving, but it was fine. I didn't need to apply any lotion after I got out of the shower, I felt moisturized enough. I am still waiting for the matching body sorbet lotion. If you don't plan on using the matching lotion, you don't have to worry about putting on purfume or another scented lotion as the smell of the body scrub isn't strong and wouldn't mix with another scent.I think this is a great way to unwind at the end of a long, tiring day... a great way to pamper yourself in your own shower without having to go to a spa!"
1,Half star is actually too much!,"What a waste of money. Don't buy this book. The recipes have not been tested. Each and every one I made did not work. Shame on the authors, shame on the publisher!"
5,Wonderful and soothing................,"This CD is lovely to listen to. Yo-Yo Ma plays his cello so beautifully, and the singers and other musicians are fantastic.It lulls you to sleep, but not quite. Highly recommend!"
2,Tempt Me,"Irisa uses whatever means she must to make herself free to marry as she wishes, to Lucas Ashton, dubbed the Saint for his unrougish ways. Even after she risks alienating her parents, she is quick to doubt her fiance's faithfulness. Then, she is sure that he is too good for her and that marrying her would besmirch his reputation, so, once again, tries to cry off. Lucas, however, will have none of it. Despite blackmail, virginal fears, multiple misunderstandings, and a kidnapping, he continues to love and come to the rescue of his true love.** Though Lucas is a true hero, one almost too good to be true, Irisa frankly, gets on one's nerves. The majority of the conflict in this book arises from her misunderstandings of whatever situation in which she finds herself. Lucas is truly a saint if patience is the cardinal virtue for one as the proverb says. **Amanda Killgore"
5,This product is great!,I received this foot butter as a gift a couple of years ago. I have always had a problem with extremely dry skin and I must say that this foot butter is incredibly effective. I can't live without it!
2,Tubes too small,The tubes arrived on time but there were way too small for adults. The size would only accommodate a young child even though it was listed for adults.
3,"Tube pretty, but will it hold up?","Nice looking pool tube, but I'm wondering if it will last over several seasons. Oh well, if it doesn't, the sale price was so good I'dd just buy another one..."
3,Archaic but amusing.,"This comedy/musical extravaganza, set mostly aboard an ultra-modern luxury liner, does not hold up as well as most of W.C. Fields' films. It is overlong and rather dull in spots, but several funny scenes (with Fields, of course) almost compensate. Surpringly, the best scene is that in which Bob Hope sings, for the first time, the song that has become indelibly associated with him for the past 63 years, ""Thanks For the Memory"". It is a duet with Shirley Ross, and it is done not as a funny novelty song, but as a poignant one. Worth seeing."
2,Save your money!!!,"The stones look fake and the ""silver"" looks fake. Also, the stone is ridiculously small and is not nearly as large as it's shown in the picture. The picture is *VERY* misleading. The only reason I kept them was because they don't look terrible and they were a gift."
4,"Easy to do, but not as challenging as I thought","I must be flexible, because I found the exercises very easy to do. The format is easy to follow, and they explain the stretches very well. I've never done yoga before, and wanted to increase my flexablility but found these too easy. Next time I'll try the next step up. All in all, this was a great dvd."
3,EASY DOES IT CAMERA,"I received this camera for a Christmas present. My first digital camera, it's a snap to use. Good quality pictures, easy to use instruction booklet, and conveniently small size are it's best features. The limit of 4 or 8 MB memory cards is a little diassapointing unless one purchases several (they are rather inexpensive). The carrying case is handy and it is thoughtfuly included in the camera package, as is also the software to edit pictures and the serial cable and USB cable. The USB cable makes downloading go pretty fast. A fun, versatile, convenient camera."
3,Time to update your toy list?,Do not you think it is about time to update the book.It is frustrating to face the fact that there is more than 50% of the toys listed cannot be found on the internet and in any stores???
5,Very Entertaining and Educational,"I found this In Grand Assembly documentary to be quite fascinating. You can say it's one of a kind. I especially enjoyed the assembly highlights like the biblical dramas. It could be the fact that I like watching plays. The documentary also showed how dedicated these Jehovah Witnesses are to their belief structure. I was in awe when I saw the huge crowd standing in line to be baptized in a public stadium in Los Angeles. The mass baptism itself was also quite interesting. If anything, I thought this documentary was entertaining as well as educational. I was amazed at how many people, from around the world, show up to these huge assemblies. This documentary gives me the feeling that I just might learn something new at a Jehovah Witness assembly, like I did watching this documentary."
3,"Good, but I wish mp3 bitrate was higher","GOOD: It's the soundtrack to Jurassic Park, one of my favorites from composer John Williams.BAD: I use very high-quality headphones when listening to my music and I can hear the compression in some of the tracks. Those that were recorded at 192kb and higher sound excellent, but if they dip below that (and I believe these were encoded with a variable bitrate), I can hear the compression in the high notes of some of the pieces. It detracts from an otherwise superb album. Will most people hear this compression, no, but audiophiles may be a bit disappointed.BOTTOM LINE: Audiophiles, if you really want this album, buy the CD and make your own mp3s."
4,Williams blends majesty and terror with excellent results.,"While John Williams's score for Jurassic Park does not do for dinos what his score for Jaws did for sharks, namely give them a simple and memorable theme that can both raise a smile and gooseflesh, his work is excellent nonetheless. The majestic theme perfectly captures the magical character of the film, while the Opening Titles and Dennis Steals the Embryo tracks have a nice creepy edge to theme, letting the listener feel the threat lurking in the Park's very real jungle. Fans of Jurassic Park or John Williams, or both, need no prodding to add this to their collections. Recommended."
5,Comprehensive review with actionable advice,"This book bridges the gap between management summary/overviews and tutorial/how-to books. It starts out with an introduction to the basic concepts and differences between EAI, EII and ETL. The book later explores issues associated with the ""single view of the customer"" problem and metdata management. The book includes several case studies and ends with a step-by-step review of how a model driven approach could be utilized to address a classical EII problem. Highly recommended."
5,Just awesome,"I'm never been very good at cooking so this wedding present was perfect for me. The rice will come out perfectly done and it's great for steaming vegetables too. I've not use the soup or cake options, but it's worth buying just for cooking rice and steam vegetables. Definitely recommended."
4,Great rice cooker for Sushi.,This rice cooker has the flexibility to do what ever you need in your kitchen. But the ability to make perfect rice for sushi is well above the anticipated performance for the product.
3,"Worthwhile movie, if only for John Denver","Walking Thunder is an okay movie. It's family-friendly, with nothing really to complain about. But it's also a little bland and forgettable, as much as I hate to say that. In fact, I saw this movie several years ago but forgot almost everything about it as far as plot details. I'll admit that my only interest in it is because John Denver has a starring role, even if it wasn't his one of his best.I couldn't believe it, though, when the opening credits started rolling and just about everyone who had anything to do with the film, including 'Bart the Bear' (the ursine actor who plays the part of ""Walking Thunder"", the grizzly bear in the movie"") was listed before JD! Really?!Again, this is an acceptable family film, but probably will mostly be of interest to fans of John Denver."
5,Fantastic Resource!!!,This book provides a wealth of information across the board! We found it very helpful with our costume design/rental business.
5,A brief opinion on beans,"I went out on a limb and bought some designer beans. They were flavorful ( great with chili peppers) and packed with protien. I would recommend them if you are curious about inviting a new bean into your life, otherwise, you are being a slave and should quit being interested in what everyone else is."
1,what?,who ever had the idea to make this movie i am about ready to kill. this is horrible. they are ruining a classic. this is like one of those movies that cant have a sequel because the original is gonna always be the best. big mistake making this and its pissing me off really bad.
1,O_O WOW!!!,"first off id like to say if you havent seen the original i HIGHLY recommend it. its a true classic. but anyways, The Sandlot 2 is terrible, for 1 it went straight to video (flop) , 2 that acting sucks,3 it doent live up to the original at all!!! it doesnt even have the same message as the original. it is just a discrace. just bad bad bad."
4,Great fun if not a great movie,"Is Sandlot 2 a great movie? No. But it more than filled my expectations. I purchased the film for my eight-year old grandson and my enjoyment of sharing his enjoyment of the movie made it a wonderful investment.The Sandlot 2 is children's theater. It is about kids being kids and for this very reason the movie made great sense to the person it was purchased for and I expect that he will enjoy it many times with various friends and I hope to share the fun of watching it with him a few more times. Great movie? No, but it was surely great fun and no worse than many films that he likes."
2,"My son loves it, mom doesn't","HI All! My son is 5 and is a huge baseball fan, so this movie is right up his alley. He has already watched it about a dozen times... I do not care for it at all...I think the original is a classic, and so much more fun. This poor version takes place in the 70's when the girls were going through ""liberation"" , ""equality"", and first loves, all of which is over my son's head. He thinks the kissing is gross and doesn't understand a lot of it. At least there is a little bit of baseball which can keep him happy. For our family, this much anticipated movie is a major dissappointment. :o( As they say ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". They should have left the original alone and never attempted this disaster. Lots more name calling, insults and language than the first, not what a mom wants her 5 year old to emulate. If you MUST see it, rent it before you buy it, so you don't totally waste your money. Hope no one is thinking about Sandlot 3....YIKES!!!"
3,Not bad for a sequel,"You people who reviewed the movie without seeing it are all retarded. I have in fact seen the movie, and it isn't bad. Sure it isn't as good as the original, but anyone who hasn't seen it has no basis upon which to say anything about the movie. When one of you morons actually does watch the movie, then you can say something. Until then, shut your mouths."
1,Horrendous...,"Clearly trying to capitalizes on the success of the 1st Sandlot, it seems as though the producers/writers of this effort scrapped together a script over a long weekend. I am speechless that there are positive reviews of this film, with the only possible explanation being that you have somehow been led through this series backwards, seeing the second one first. This is simply a money grab by the Hollywood brass behind this debacle-the plot just mirrors that of the first. I am determined to simply forget that this film exists, as it's not worthy of the name of the franchise. That being said, the Sandlot III, with Sideshow Luke Perry, kills Sandlot II. It's exponentially better than II, and probably should have been the only sequal. Don't waste you time with II..."
5,nice,"Mellow, easy music. Guitar is my favorite instrument so this is a natural for me. He is a talented man."
1,Way too loud- not worth the money,This pump is very loud. It does hurt your ears. It also takes a long time to blow up any inflatable pool. The valves that come with it are not small enough to fit into some pool valves. Not worth the money.
5,Beautiful representation of mass-production,"As expected from Revoltech, this figure is great! This is the one winged figure and it is really awesome! It's very detailed and well done. When put together with the wings, the figure doesn't fall at all. It has a very good balance. Both winged, non-winged and with different combinations of hands are great! :D"
4,These guys made great ballads,"My goodness, some music from the 80's did not age well. Ready for the World is guilty on several charges. 15 years later, their uptempo chart hits like ""Digital Display"" and ""Mary Goes Round"" sound absolutely ridiculous.That aside, Ready for the World fared much better when they did what they do best: Ballads. ""Tonight"" is magnificent, this is a slow jam if there ever was one! These guys harmonize, the beats, albeit SLOW beats, are funky and fit the mood correctly. Same thing with ""Love You Down"" and ""Deep Inside Your Love"". My suggestion: buy it for the slow jams, dim the lights, and enjoy..."
3,bad photos at 640 format,"Don't buy this camera if you need to take (good quality) small file size photos like I do. The 640x 480 format (they are about 100kb) are just horrid. For some reason this darn camera wants to ALWAYS take at a 2.8 f-stop and a with a high speed shutter (1/1000). It just won't take at f-5.5 and the edges are not clear on the 640x480 format. However, if you don't mind having 250kb files for each photo then the quality is pretty good. Use the 4/3 format and the low quality setting. At 4/3 format and high quality the files per photo are about 450kbs. Too much for my use!"
3,"Well, You expect more","I tried a lot to buy the best camera for the price, and for the price it is good. but here are down sides!No sound in recording! I tried my best to figure out if it records sound with movie, too bad I found that as a small print at the end of brochoure after buying it (I hate the fact they purposly hide info, you don't expect that from Panasonic)!Huge movie file! I dont know how long it would take for panasonic to switch to MPG4 format from this stupid Quicktime. You expect rational decision from Panasonic!Some blury pictures! Panasonic's selling point from the beginning has been inclusion of optical image stabilization as standard, compared to other brands like Canon. How come 10-15% of oics come blury, especially at nights!Still it worth the price, it would be great if Panasonic makes better cameras too"
4,Classic,I got to admit I never heard of Edgar Kennedy before but my husband used to watch the re-runs when he was a kid and it has truned out to be a good show.
5,Humvee Safari vest,This vest fits great & I wear it on every photo shoot. I love having the ability to carry extra glass & filters with me instead of having to dig them out of my case. Now I just need more stuff to carry!
3,Pretty good Highsmith,"I love Patricia Highsmith's work and have read most of her novels. This is a good read, but not as exciting as STRANGERS ON A TRAIN or the Ripley books. Definitely Ms. Highsmith in a more contemplative mode."
5,Highsmith's Best,"Graham Greene once said that ""The Tremor of Forgery"" was his favorite book of Patricia Highsmith. After reading it I couldn't but agree with him. ""Tremor"" is a travel book, but also ""character in crisis"" book in the best Highsmith way. The depth of the situations, emotions and sutile mistery, make the reader plunge into despair when the last page folds and the story ends."
2,The tremor of boredom,"I was completely underwhelmed by this book. The pace was excruciatingly slow, to the point where I found the book painful to read. I realize that the author was, presumably,intending to depict the aimless waiting that was the protagonist's life; and to capture the feeling of the tropical climate and culture of late 60s Tunisia, but the effect was to put me to sleep and to leave me longing for something interesting to happen. I also was not particularly fond of the author's spare, often choppy writing style. When I found myself thinking ""I ought to read another chapter of this book so I can finish it and get on to something else,"" I gave up. I don't know how it ended and frankly I don't care."
3,good but.....,"This product has helped eliminate most ingrown hairs along my bikini line and has minimized the bumps/ingrown hairs that are still there. If you have any open cuts or anything like that, this stuff does sting! I feel that this product is the equivalent of rubbing alcohol, so if you want to save some money just dab on some rubbing alcohol. After using this product for almost a month now, there is dead skin particles and ""floaty things"" in the container.. which to get rid of you would need to dump the entire product. the roll on part is convenient. however i would recommend saving your money and buying rubbing alcohol."
5,cool!,"I really needed this but was afraid to purchase because it might not have worked to my ""standards""...it did! I love it and will cherish forever :P"
2,Did nothing.,"After getting some pretty bad irritation with ingrowns after waxing, i was recommended this product.It did absolutely nothing for me except dry out my skin. I continued to get ingrowns and now im left with dark marks...definitely didn't work for me."
3,Burns a little but does the trick,The product I was formally using was backordered with no information on when it would be available so I started looking for a replacement. I have tried this formula before but never in the roll-on form. This product burns more than the other product I had and has more of a scent but it still does a great job.
5,NO MORE RAZOR BUMPS!!!,"I have suffered from very bad irritation/bumps due to shaving and have tried many topical products that are supposed to help with the irritation. I even looked into getting VERY PRICEY laser hair removal in an effort to stop the bumps. Before I shelled out the money for the laser treatments, a friend told me about this product. I was definitely skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try. I can honestly say it is the BEST product I have tried for this problem. I used it as directed and within a matter of 2 days, my bumps were TOTALLY gone. Just know that it does have a mild burning sensation when you use it after shaving, but it's worth it. Amazing product!!!"
3,Could be better...,"I found this game confusing in places and really intriguing in others. The one thing that irks me the most about the game play is that it has no map to take you automatically where you want to go so it gets quite tiresome and boring. I had to leave the game several times out of pure frustration because I kept getting ""lost"" on the endless paths in it. Other than that, the graphics are pretty good, but the storyline could be better. I felt like it was very slow, and the game lagged on. It's good if you are an Agatha Christie enthusiast like me, but other than that, I would recommend ""Evil Under the Sun"" instead (which still has no map to jump to locations)."
1,Disappointing,"I tried hard to like this game but it's just too boring. The worse thing for me is the dialogue and voice acting. I could put up with the poor character graphics if the characters at least had some interesting things to say. There are very few puzzles. The action consists mainly of picking up a lot of items and using them in ridiculous, nonintuitive ways. A real disappointment. Save your money."
2,Love Agatha but the Game was Boring,"I Like Nancy Drew type games and occasionaly Law and Order, but this was really boring. Having read the book I was ready for something spectacular and I was given something so mundane a three-year old could accomplish the tasks by simply clicking around the screen until something works. I hated it....It was nothing to figure out. People just kept dying while you do stupid tasks throught the game.It was fun at first seeing the characters you read about and the ten little indians in the middle of the dining room tale come to life on the screen before you, but after the thrill is over, the thrill of the game is really over!!!!Don't waste your time, buy a Nancy Drew game. You'll enjoy it so much more than this."
5,Foley is God,"This is simply the best wrestling video ever made! Immensly entertaining, with segments of the reveling 4-part RAW interview w/ Jim Ross as well as Falls Count Anywhere matches with Mick Foley and Terry Funk and Cactus Jack and HHH..Includes footage from the most incredible match in the history of wrestling, Hell in a Cell from KOTR '98...Just an amazing video...! ""Have a Nice Day!"" :)"
5,What a great little suprise,I had to get a book for my class at school and just thew a dart at the list and got this one. It is a very good read and I have learn a lot about what the day to day life of the Falcon was like
1,Woe is McDuff,"I love the other McDuff books, but McDuff Saves the Day is disappointing. The story is weak, doesn't flow, and is inconsistent. The illustrations, especially the pictures of McDuff, are not nearly so captivating as in the other books. I wonder if this book was rushed to press before July 4, the holiday around which it is centered."
3,"Love McDuff, but not this book","We have several McDuff books and love them, however, McDuff Saves The Day has very little action and Jeffers normally fantastic illustrations seem hastily drawn and uninspired."
2,Great sound,This unit has great sound and is well worth the price. I had no issues setting it up or programming it. Connected to all my devices with no issue.
2,"Good system, but no optical input!","This is really a nice system, but the one drawback is a huge one. There is no optical cable input. Why Panasonic neglected to add this is a mystery. They also do not have an optical input on their higher end systems. After purchasing this system, I had to return it.If having a good system with adequate stereo sound is what you want, this would be a good purchase. If you are an audiophile looking for a true surround sound theater experience, this system is NOT for you.I would recommend that you instead look at the 8 speaker ONKYO Home Theater System 7.1 HTS780B. For around $50-$100 more than this system you can get a state of the art 7.1 system. The Onkyo is 1000 watts and sounds awesome. It will also give you a cutting edge system that is actually ahead of the technology curve. It doesn't come with an integrated DVD player like the Panasonic, but you probably already have a DVD player anyway, right?"
4,Excellent Toy - Lousy Music,"I have the toy boom box that was made in the 1980's. My granddaughter likes mine so much that I bought her one for her birthday. The music the boom box plays was a complete disappointment. The one I have plays Rock & Roll, Country, Pop, etc. The new boom box plays Barbie fantasy songs that are not catchy & are pretty much boring & worthless. I also checked out the Barbie pretend cameras and did not purchase either one because one played music from ""Swan Lake"" and the other one ""Prince and the Pauper"". Can't these designers come up with any fun songs for these little girls now days??? My granddaughter will like her boom box but will proabably still like mine better."
2,Not Much Depth,"While Quicksteps covers the basics, I found it shallow, not well organized and a very weak index. If you are starting a database from scratch, it will work you through it, but it was not much help where I wanted to convert several databses to Access. Inexpensive, but worth it."
3,not much different than the austin video,This video pretty much repeats what's on the OH HELL YEAH video.The commentaries by Jim Ross and Michael Cole add nothing to the story.
2,Outdated technology,"The hype surrounding these speakers is disturbing. Yes I actually own a pair of 901 Series VI Walnut finish speakers complete with stands and equalizer, so I know what I'm talking about.If you pay full price for these you will be disappointed. The low bass is almost nonexistent and the treble is also nonexistent. You will need to crank up your bass to extremely high levels to compensate, and the treble that is there is very harsh. The direct-reflecting 901 requires a wall positioning with no nearby clutter and the speakers are not shielded so keep them at least 3 feet away from the television. It does give an 'airy' sound but somehow manages to completely destroy the stereo imaging in the process.These would make good DJ speakers with a powerful amp, but are useless for any other music application I can think of."
2,not what I expected,"Admittedly I, like another customer, misread the product. I was looking for cocoa.But my low rating does come from this product itself. I was weary about trying it, once I received it and saw what it was because I have always had a sensitivity to caffeine. So I made sure I tried this on a day when I was seriously dragging a**. Nada. No response. I tried it again when I wasn't as tired. Same. And then again on a morning where I was good to go. Still didn't see any effects.Maybe my box was exposed to elements and lost its ZING, I don't know. But it was basically flavored water for $25.00/box.Upside, it did have good flavor all on its own."
4,Its really nice,"This CD is really hot, he has some nice ballads the kind beautiful black people would get married to and he has some soft uptempo joints too. I bought his CD based on his voice alone but I was pleasently surprised. One of my favorite cuts is called ""In your hands"" it is really pretty. If you like Jesse Powell, Kenny Latimore, and Ginuwine you'll like this guy. He is sophisticated and genuine, so obviously he doesn't get enough attention, but once you hear him you'll be telling all your friends about him."
4,"Yes ALex, I'll take Javier for $1000","Wow....when I first heard his song crazy I knew this cat was talented. The only other question left to answer was, would his producers destroy his sound by giving him music that didn't fit him....Well ladies and gents...I don't think this album could be better if Jesus had produced it. This album is amazing. I think my favorite is number 6 ""The Biggest Mistake of my Life""..I can't begin to tell u how much I love this cd and I'm not...I'm just going to suggest u buy it now cause its wortj it!"
4,Pretty Good Book,"I thought it was a good book, and that it really taught me about my private parts, but I think it was really meant for kids younger than me only because I'm 8 years old."
4,Great but maybe not for Preschool age,"I was looking for a book to answer my 3 and a half year old girl's many questions. This is a great book with fantastic illustrations and appropriate explanations. However, the pictures depicting especially male ""private parts"" might be too advanced for my daughter. I thought it might be more appropriate either for a pre school boy or a 5-6 year old boy or girl."
5,Great book,"I bought this book for my incredibly inquisitive 4 year old daughter and we really enjoyed it. It's great for boys or girls as all the ""parts"" are illustrated and explained. This was a great addition to our other books about the body and how it works."
3,A little surprised....,When I ordered this book it was mainly for my 3 yr old grand-daughter.... the book was very informative.... BUT - it was very graphic for a 3 yr old and went into ALOT of detail on reproduction etc... the book said it was for pre-schoolers...I think it was more appropriate for my 8 to 10 yr old grandchildren... and would suggest not shared while with mixed genders....
4,Close to what I was looking for.,"I was looking for a book for my 5 year old to explain the differences between boys and girls. There aren't a lot of options out there but this book was what I was looking for without being too graphic. Although, they go into a little more detail about childbirth then my son is ready for. I just skipped this part and will go back to that when I feel he is ready."
3,"If you're looking for details, this is your book!","I purchased this book to aid in explanation of my pregnancy and upcoming delivery of baby #4. My almost 8-year-old daughter is very curious about babies and the whole process, and is also developing a sense of ""privacy."" This book, specifically the illustrations, made my husband blush, my jaw drop, and, needless to say, we haven't read it to our kids - we also have an almost 6-year-old son and almost 5-year-old daughter - and probably won't.We are pretty open about private parts, or so we thought, but this book would have opened up questions that we just aren't prepared to answer yet. Maybe in a year or two, we'll approach it with our oldest, but I think there are better books geared to pregnancy than this one. ""What to Expect when Mommy's Expecting"" has been a favorite here lately and gives a good overview of pregnancy, delivery, and life with a newborn without getting too graphic or detailed."
3,Zipped,"Interesting story, but not extremely well done. It was a little long in parts and teaches that its okay to keep huge secrets like infidelity in marriage or vandalizing cars and in the end everything will be hunky dory."
3,where is the missing milan medley???,"the milan medley is only on the import version of the kinky boots soundtrack, and the track list above is the list for that version. its a great track, the highlight of the soundtrack and of the movie, and its worth the extra cash to buy the import version. boo to amazon for not correcting this error."
5,THIS TAPE LIVES UP TO IT'S NAME!!,"This tape features four uncut steel cage matches from 1987-1988. The first is the Saturday night main event match between Hulk Hogan and Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff in one of the best matches ever on that great, departed show. The next match is the 6 man (all men in the cage at the same time) between the Hart Foundation and the Honky Tonk Man versus Strike Force and the Macho Man Randy Savage. The third match features the awesome superplex from the top of the cage by Hulk Hogan to the Big Bossman on Saturday Night's Main Event. The final match has newly crowned WWF Champion Macho Man Randy Savage take on Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase in the cage at Madison Square Garden---watch when one of Macho's fans trys to put a stop to Virgil interfering in the match by climbing to the top of the cage to intervene!!! Tape runs about an hour and is a classic!"
4,"A concise, provocative examination of all we seek to avoid.","This is an easy to read, intelligent, provocative summary of ideas relating to the worth and power of examining and honoring our ""dark"" side, both individually and culturally. Rather than vainly trying to split the two, which causes much of the unbalance in our life and world, the author points to the essentially sacred work of balancing our growth with a foot on each side of our nature. In this way, assent is truly transcendence, and heaven and hell together reach toward God. A short book, Johnson makes his points without undue fanfare or setup. The last chapter moves into statements that challenge initial comprehension, such as, ""To make any well formed sentence is to make unity out of duality......One makes a mandorla every time one says something that is true."" Yet, upon contemplative re-reading, a deeper sense of Johnson's meanings emerges. On whole, this is a bracing, friendly and yet serious account of Work that faces us all."
3,"Promotes Acceptance, a Bit Too Long","I liked the principle that when I grow fast or experience great excitement, some part of me may experience a rebound. It gave a context for looking more fully at some of my patterns. However, the more I live in acceptance of whatever I experience without making an identify for myself out of it, the less this applies. And, the ""rebound"" is not an unavoidable part of anything good."
4,"Good pump, wish it were faster","I purchased this pump primarily to use for backyard pools and sleds in winter. It is much quieter than I expected, but I wish it were faster. It works well, but you have to make sure there are no crimps in the air tube while using."
4,A Geek's Delight,"Need a universal/learning remote? Like software development? This is the remote for you... it comes with a PC-based development environment (Think ""Visual Basic"", only much simpler.) The screen is Palm-like, unlike other ""do everything"" remotes (like the Sony Commander) this one fits in one hand. There is extensive `net support, and several on-line communities supporting this remote.Not for the faint of heart, but for a tweaker, it can't be beat - except possibly by the higher end Prontos."
4,Demme's first film is a feminist women's prison scream!,"Demme's first film a fun B-grade women's prison flick with a feminist twist. Erica Gavin and Rainbeaux Smith are two of the inmates at the prison who are in on a plot to overtake the prison and its sadistic warren, played by Barbara Steele. Features trashy dialogue, tacky '70s fashions and music by John Cale. END"
3,One of the first appearance of Desiree Cousteau,Caged heat is a typical women-in-jail film. The story is even better than the others of the style.I've ordered this film because it is one of the earliest appearance of Desiree Cousteau (Pretty Peaches - 1978) in a movie.
2,Lamont,It's been a while since I saw this movie upon receipt. The fact that I don't remember to much that was interesting is evidence that the plot was not very good and the acting left little to desire. I felt that this movie had the potential to be a four star attraction. I guest you can blame that on the writers. I have 100's of DVD's in my collection...and can detail all the good/great one's.I was not particularly impressed with this movie. It did arrive on time though.
4,All the songs you love!,Great DVD with all the mixes you love. Fun to play this DVD at a party with the visuals.
3,Good guide lousy binding,Same as previous reviews. The information is very informative and well written but the binding fell apart the first day I read it.
4,Mixed Feelings,For starters if you ride a motorcycle and you don't read and or subscribe to Motorcycle Consumer News your missing out. MCN is the source of the material in this book. Awesome read and a must have for any motorcyclist no matter what he or she rides. My one and only beef with this book is the binding. It fell apart the first time I read it. i took it to Kinko's and they rebound it for me using a spiral bound so it was easier to leave open to the instructional bits when I was taking mental notes or praticing a certain move at the local high school.
2,Not nearly concise enough,"The topics covered are important, but the author's explanations are needlessly long-winded. He also repeats himself frequently. The essential information could be explained in about 1/5 of the author's ramblings. I had trouble staying awake long enough to get through a chapter. I frankly don't understand why so many people rave about this book."
1,Very poorly constructed book,"I suppose the content of the book could be O.K. except the pages fell away from the binding leaving me with a mess that I had no interest in trying to re-organize. There is enough other stuff out there to satisfy my learning. I've just placed Mr. David Hough and his publisher Bow Tie on my ""rip-off"" list. It really gets ""no stars"" because it is unusable."
5,A must read for all motorcycle riders,"For any rider, either new or master, this book is a must. This book provides a collection of articles from John Hough, that are timely even though they were written years ago."
3,Good book but ......,"You definitely will benefit the most if you already have some riding experience, otherwise is too advance and technical. Also, a new edition should include better and more detailed drawings"
3,safer motorcycling,This is a great book for someone that has learned to ride without any professional training.
4,LEAPS & BOUNDS OVER THE FIRST!,"While the 1st album was good, this 2nd is where it is @. Soo fun of a listen! Can not wait to hear the deluxe with the additional remixes. Wished i could have seen them @ Bonnaroo. Check out their vidz on youTube!"
1,"Nice lantern, but issues after warranty expires","I've had this lantern for 4 years, using it for camping and the occasional power outage. It's a great product, providing ample light and reasonable battery life.However, recently the light bulb broke when I dropped the light. I tried for weeks to find a replacement, both online and in hardware stores, but no luck. I finally called GE customer service and I was told that the light bulb ""is not meant to be replaced"". It turns out that the bulbs are proprietary for these lanterns and replacements are not available. If it happens within the 3 year warranty, you can send it in for replacement, afterwards you can ""throw the light away"" (these are the words from the customer service representative).So, 1 star only for this throw-away product!"
3,Beautiful Lantern: but not perfect,"This is for me a recent acquisition, great service from CAInternational! It is a terrific lantern, provides good, warm light instantly. However, I have been trying to figure out how to change the fluorescent lamp when it expires. The previous reviewer has now provided the answer to that question. It's hard to understand such a well-made and otherwise well-designed product being a throw-away. GE could charge for service after the warranty period, but they certainly ought to make lamp replacements and service available."
2,Great while they last. What a waste!,"No, these will NOT be the last lanterns you'll ever buy--unless you never use them anyway.These lanterns (bought 2) were great for our camping trip fall 08. Then I used them while remodeling the basement for short periods with the power off. Very useful until the bulbs blew on both of them without too much abuse--just being knocked over. Very surprised to discover that you cannot change the bulb. So now I have to throw them away??? What a freakin waste of money and space in a landfill!! I will not buy these again. I will be careful with my next purchase and make sure I buy something with changeable bulbs."
5,Reba's Most Greatest hits,This C.D in spires me because of the song Fancy. It probably has atouch on a lot of people. Also her song Does he Love you. The songs have a lot of meaning to them. I hope that Reba never quits singing and writing songs. I think she is the best ever.
4,no scatches,"this was a good cd, no scratches but the case was hand made looking. didn't really appreciate that deatail being left out. all in all i will purchase again from this seller."
4,Second Best Movie Set In Texas,"The Great Texas Dynamite Chase is a title that doesn't lie. This movie is great, it's set in Texas, it's dynamite, and there's a chase. It's also the second best movie ever made that is set in Texas, with the first being The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There is a lot of nudity in this thing, with boobies, butts, and pubic hair making many random appearances. Fun for the whole family!"
5,Ideal for people who took QFT but never truly understood it,"I just got a copy of the book this week and am absolutely giddy with excitement. I took QFT back in 1980 using Itzykson and Zuber. I never really did understand it well, though I got high marks for learning how to calculate stuff. I think I understand more after the first 30 pages of this book than I did after that entire semester.I've been looking for a book like this for the last ten years. Finally, there is an author who can communicate concepts as well as Feynman."
5,Perfect for learning field theory on your own,I would like to thank Professor Zee for writing his excellent book. I may not be in its original intended audience - I studied physics long ago and work in an unrelated field. But I was always curious about field theory and his book has enabled me to learn it on my own. It is by far the clearest and easiest to follow book I've found on the subject. I suspect there are many more like me who have read it. Thanks and well done.
2,Yankee Fairy Tales,"A curiously empty book. In Madden's eagerness to write a Yankee love letter, profiling former greats reminiscing about their careers as a Yankee, he forgot to include any insight or much else of interest. There are better interviews and profiles of just about every figure in this book in a host of other Yankee books (including some by Madden), and it simply gets tiresome to read the same sentiments (and often the same stories) over and over again. The books reads as if the author decided ahead of time what he wanted from his subjects and once he got that, moved on. There are plenty of missed opportunities to probe further into the lives of his subjects, but I guess the marketing reports indicated that readers weren't interested. Good for gluttons only, but there are better birthday cards than this to celebrate the Yankees 100th anniversary."
3,Day Dream Believers,"I enjoyed learning more about the personal lives of one of my favorite 60's bands The Monkees. Although I was very young at the time, I did not realize how hard these guys worked to make a name for themselves. I recommend this product."
3,Precision lawn cart,"We reeceived 14 cu ft lawn cart on June 9, 2011. It was quite difficult to assemble - took two people about 5 hours. The plywood bottom was damaged, but we asssembled it and then called UPS about damage. Was told someone would contact us within 5 days, never happened. After several more attempts, called UPS today and was told that a claim for damages must come from the shipper - not told that in first contact. Very disappointed in customer service, but the cart is OK. We will try to repair the bed of the cart. Thanks."
2,Starts out well but...,"Starts out well but fizzles after part one. Leela (Lily) becomes a bland and annoying character, certainly not ""exotic"". Her character never develops. Actually, none of the characters are well described except for those in part one. The story loses its appeal and the ending, especially the romantic interest with Olivier, seems contrived. The 'smell' angle was intriguing but the overall story was poor."
3,Kehinde,"Kehinde is an interesting novel. Its many non-western characteristics allow the reader to become aware of a an entirely different society than their own. This book is relatively short and easy to read, and serves as a good time-filler during breaks. It's worth taking a look at."
2,"This item really ""is bad""","Bought this for my wife, an avid bird watcher. She was shocked at the poor quality compared to the high price to say the least! First, .8 mega pixels ""is bad"". Next 3X is even worse than the low megapixels. And worst. There is no way to adjust the distance between the eye pieces, therefore, if you are more than 10 years old you can't see through the thing. So it is back in the box and will probably never be used again. This item would be 5 stars if it were ""a lot less than I paid for it."" It is a yard sale item. Best price and best service on Amazon as always."
2,"Good Concept, Poor FM Radio, Poor Tone","The concept is great-CD,AM/FM,tape,clock radio with remote-all in one unit.However, the product needs improvement. Despite the 4 pre-set tone controls and spatial equalizer, the tone quality is poor. Very scratchy and shrill no matter which setting is used. Has honky quality to the sound. The FM radio is the worst I have ever heard-noisy background on every FM station. I live in a strong signal area with many stations...any fringe area would be much worse. Only switching to MONO clears it up. I placed a Sony CFD-e75 right next to it-the reception was perfect-totally quiet background. Get the Sony!"
4,Loaded for Buffalo,"I'd known of Buffalo for several years but they remained a mystery until I was able to get my hands on this fine album. Like several Australian bands (The Angels, Rose Tattoo, Heaven) they never got much recognition in the States. Only Want You For Your Body is great 70s hard rock! The guitarist cranks out solid riffs and the vocalist has a strong set of pipes. It may be a bit drenched in reverb but that's the way I like it. Five of the seven songs from the original album made it onto my I-pod. It is definitely worth getting if you are a connoisseur of hard rock."
3,Enya - The Video Collection,"Got this dvd from a seller in finland thru ebay. The videos were a little disappointing coz they all look the same. It always shows her singing seriously with almost no emotion. the images before each song were nice but was expecting something more personal and creative with her videos. If your a big Enya fan then go ahead and buy it, but if your not a real big fan I would just borrow it from a friend and watch it once. Coz that's how many times I've watch it since I bought it."
1,"Beware, these are NOT read by the authors!","Beware, these are NOT recited by the authors! You might think from the product description that this contains actual readings by Ogden Nash and Dorothy Parker. In fact, what you get are staged readings by Jack Lemmon and a coupla chicks. I paid only $1 + shipping, so I'm not torqued off, but I see a coupla high priced offerings, so I thought you should know what they're actually selling."
4,Laid Back,"The Song Remembers When is another classy release from adult contemporary/country singer Trisha Yearwood. She has a powerful and versatile voice that sounds equally convincing on sentimental ballads and more soulful numbers. The title track falls into the former category. You can tell Trisha was heavily invested in the lyrics based on her passionate vocal performance. As with all of Trisha's records, the harmonies are a highlight. Willie Nelson guests on ""Hard Promises to Keep"" and his own ""One in a Row."" Other great songs include ""I Don't Fall in Love So Easy"" and the mysterious ""Mr. Radio."" 4 Stars."
1,disappointing!,"This is not the right edition, but an old one.And the book is very very used, not like the description..."
2,Glutton for Punishment,"As I must have been to keep reading this book. Ray is a young American in Venice whose very young, very rich wife has just committed suicide. He's not too upset, and his wife is not the focus of anything, but his rude, demanding father-in-law is upset and is the focus. His father-in-law Ed blames Ray for the suicide of his daughter. He attempts to murder an unsuspecting and trusting Ray. Ray is surprised by this, but survives and wants to track down Ed and ""explain"" his marriage. To a murderer.The rest is more attempts on Ray's life and his not learning his lesson. He finally fights back but doesn't bother to press charges against Ed when asked to.Apparently Ray is one who ""walks away"" from confrontation or doing what is right for society."
1,Editor was out sick?,"Oddly enough, I was assigned to read this book at random by my professor for a publication class in which we are to practice reading generic, terrible, and mind numbing manuscripts just in case we get jobs in the publishing world. Just six pages in and the language is already frustratingly poor. Bottom-line, this is the type of writing I would expect from a first draft in a college writing class. However, there is one thing that makes me smile when reading this book, and that is that if Mrs. Elena John can get published, anyone can."
1,Beware of used electronic items,Beware of used electronic items. Failed units look identical to good ones. To offer them for sale is a fraud. Compact Flash readers are susceptible to pin damage. Ham-fisted people who try to force cards into the reader the wrong way will bend or break the pins. That's exactly what was wrong with the two I received.
3,Not as good as Chipotle flavor,"First, I'm not really a big fan of Tabasco sauce in general. I don't think it's particularly flavorful. However, I absolutely LOVE the Chipotle flavored TABASCO. I think it makes amazing barbeque sauce and it's very good in beans, and on chicken. After reading the description I gave the Garlic Pepper a chance. I don't taste the garlic. It does nothing for me... but it's not bad enough to deserve a 2 star rating."
3,A satisfying hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Garlic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others. It has a satisfying flavor--I especially like its saltiness and tanginess. Also, it is neither too hot nor too mild. This is a recommendable product."
5,WONDERFUL DEBUT MYSTERY SERIES,"Rebecca Kohles has combined her passion for mystery and suspense with her love of horses and has brillantly constructedan extremely satisfying first novel. The prose is perfectionin 212 pages, there is not a word that doesn't belong exactlywhere it is placed.Alexandra Markum is a fresh and original character. The best thing since Miss Marple.The Ghosts of Grand Detour is a read for any day of the week.It is pure pleasure and the only disappointing part is finishingthe novel and wanting more."
2,Could have done better,"What happened, Mary? The remix album to ""What's the 411?"" is kind of sloppy. The Uptown flavor skits at the beginning of tracks 3,4,9, and 12 are okay. ""I Don't Want To Do Anything"", which was her duet with K-Ci is just as good as the original version."
5,"Love it, Lots & Lots of Paper : )","I did a LOT of research and found this background paper to be the best buy. The roll is super large, there is a lot of paper, the paper is sturdy. I love it, and would buy again."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a terrible product from a bad company. You don't find out that it's worthless until you open the package and by then the company will refuse to take the product back because you've opened the package. You can follow the application directions perfectly, but it's not going to go on your screen without lots of bubbles that make it even harder to see the screen. Even if you report them to the BBB this company will not work with you to find a solution, so just don't waste your money to begin with."
1,Heed Our Warnings!,"As the others here have commented, this is a terrible product. I wasn't too put off by the lack of vibrancy. I draw on my tm2 and wanted to protect it from scratches. This kind of protector is good for a little while, but even though it comes with cleaning instructions, it can't be done. You can even trap dirt beneath it guaranteeing a greater chance of scratching. There are $5-$6 products similar to this that are much more worth the temporary protection that these provide. Do not waste your money, and more importantly protect your screen FROM this product!!"
3,Starts out great but quickly goes down hill.,"This deck starts out with a novel idea, to present the Rider Waite deck with more inspiring photographic images. It starts out fairly true to this goal with the major arcanum. By the time they reached the suit cards though they were totally exhausted obviously. The remaining cards do not follow the traditional symbolism at all. For instance the corresponding number of cups are just shown on the ground with no other significance keys at all. Toward this end, you would be much better to go with the Healing Tarot deck."
5,The Teutle'$ Make Bank,"I just ordered the first and second season. I am impressed at the creativity that is put into OCC's bikes. If I rode a panhead for 25-years and rebuilt it twice, I would be jeolous of the teutle's success too. Panhead's, welcome to the 21st Century."
5,Nanci's Finest Hour,"Nanci Griffith is an undiscovered country/folk gem. Her voice is as sweet as a honeydew, and she makes you think, even as she's lulling you with a silky melody. MCA Years covers a lot of ground, 18 excellent songs that span most of her career. She sings mostly of the joys and heartaches of the Texas farmland, and of loves remembered, found and lost. But there is never any bitterness, or rancor. You can almost see her half-cocked smile, even as she's making us reach for a hanky or two. ""Trouble in the Fields,"" and ""It's a hard life wherever you go"" are standouts. ""Late Nite Grand Hotel"" is eerily familiar without feeling like a rehash, and ""Just Another Morning Here"" is spiced with pinches of salt and irony. This is a must have for anyone who likes their country a little different, or is a Nanci completist."
2,A big disappointment,"I've been a Peter Turnbull fan for many years. Sadly, the past few books haven't been up to the standard he set with Deep and Crisp and Even, or Long Day Monday. With Perils and Dangers, Turnbull has turned to what is almost a ""cosy"" -- one of those little mysteries that are light both in weight and substance. The writing here is far removed from the intense, powerful Ray Sussock P. Division novels. And the book isn't helped by inferior editing (the constant misplacing of commas, for example) that actually alters what the author was trying to say. As well, this book has one of the nastiest covers I've ever seen, and removing the dust jacket is no remedy because this is a casebound book--which means that the art is part of the cover itself.Sadly, I couldn't possibly recommend this book. But I would, with great enthusiasm, suggest readers new to Turnbull go to the early books in order to enjoy what was a really fine, fairly peerless series."
2,A Below Average Book,"This review concerns the original 1937 edition. Frank and Joe aid their father in rounding up an unscrupulous, phony surgeon, who dupes his victims by promising miracle cures for their eyesight problems. The book is well-written and the action level isn't bad, but there is no real mystery to solve. Frank and Joe aren't trying to find out who did what, or where something is hidden or what this gang is up to; they are just trying to get evidence that this surgeon is a crook. For this reason, I found that the book never really made me curious to find out what was coming next. The book is really good from pages 192-204, but unfortunately that isn't enough to make this a great book. I'd only recoomend this one to true Hardy Boys fans."
2,competent but unbalanced,"Kozinn's book is a competent summary of the Beatles performance and recording career, and is refreshingly calm and balanced in its discussion of the causes for the Beatles' disbanding. It's a safe book for the relatively uninformed to read. But it fails in its stated intention of getting at the ""mechanisms"" of the Beatles' innovative genius. Although Kozinn is genuinely appreciative of Lennon's genius, the book commits the common sin of dismissing McCartney's contributions as a sort of idiot savant knack for commercial melodies. Without getting more than about 20% McCartney into the Lennon-McCartney mix, you really can't get a grip on the songbook or the remarkable recording revolution these two young men were responsible for. A more accurate title would have been ""John Lennon and Other Musicians."""
1,Again?,"What we have here is yet another Beatles fan trying to show off what he knows about their songs, and attempting to ""explain"" it all. If more accurate histories are to be trusted, the Beatles themselves, particularly their prime movers, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, didn't have a great deal in mind when they wrote these songs. Nevertheless, far too many authors, including this one, have churned out volumes of ""explanation and interpretation"" of Beatles songs, what they really mean, how they reflect the 1960s social and political scene, and so on. The last thing we needed was another one, particularly by an author who, despite his credentials as a classical music writer, is strictly another amateur Beatlemaniac posing as an authority.Betty Mitchell"
4,Just what I needed!,"The velcro is a bit problematic. It is way too loud and also can cause the belt to frey. The pouches also slide around unless you use the placement straps, and even those only help to a certain extent.Overall, though, the belt is exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy, no risk of things falling out, and easy to adjust. Just a few changes to the make of it would make it perfect."
3,Pool filter total rip off - save your money!,"We bought the 8' by 30"" easy set pool off of Amazon in May 2009. At the beginning of August, the pump started only working every other time we used it, then one day, stopped altogether. We kept it very clean, changed the filters, and used it for 6-8 hours a day. There is no reason we only got less than 3 months of use out of our pool and filter. Total waste of money - very unhappy.[...]"
5,keeps you cool on a hot day,This is my second pool of this kind. I had the first one for 4 years before it developed a slow leak in the seam of the ring. Very durable...my sister's lab jumped in and out of the pool for 2 years and never caused any damage. Great for keeping cool and enjoying a hot summer day.
2,Lasted 3 weeks.,"This was a great pool for my 5 year old daughter to play in. She also was learning how to swim, so it was perfect. The problem was that within a week it started to roll to one side and this was on our flat concreted patio with ground cover down to prevent scratching the pool plastic. As soon as it started to roll and the bottom was exposed to pressure it started leaking. For the first few days it was just a little bit and then suddenly it just ripped a seam open into a 6 inch hole that drained the whole pool in about 5 minutes.Do not buy this pool. It is great for a week or two and then it is gone."
3,Not Impressed,"Not impressed with the quality of Intex products. Wish I had checked out the BBB Los Angeles website before purchasing to see that their efforts to resolve a complaint end as ""Refuse to adjust, relying on terms of agreement"" the majority of the time."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought the 12 ft pool on sale for $78. All the filter seems to do is just move the water around, I really don't think it cleans it. It certainly doesn't catch any of the bugs. And I have grass growing up through the vinyl in mine. It should have included a ground cover. So much for the super-tough vinyl. Bottom line is, I don't think it was worth it."
2,I'm torn..,"Let me first say I'm a big big Missy Hyatt fan andwas looking forward to this book comming out fora very very long time. I was a bit dissapointed.164 pages long, many of which consist of a singleblack and white photo just wasn't enough for my[price]. If you are looking for dirt, there is somethere- but not as much as the back cover mightlead you to think. If you are a die hard MissyHyatt fan like me- you'll probably get it and don'tsay I didn't warn you. It isn't as bad as say theArn Anderson book, but it isnt the best as well.I would rate it at just under the Kurt Angle book."
2,Missy Hyatt- First lady of Wrestling,"This book was to short. There wasn't enough stories, it was like little blurbs and then on to then next one. I doesn't suprise me that her book is as bad as her website, the book does go through many highlights. I thought that it was supposed to be a tell all book, guess I was wrong..If you like Missy and Wrestling you might enjoy it, but if you want gossip then you might be disapointed."
4,"Missy Hyatt, First Lady of Wrestling","It was nice to read about the expereinces of Missy Hyatt in the world of Professional Wrestling. Up until the WWE became the monopoly in Pro wrestling, wrestling has always been my number one passion, and my favorite days were in the late 80s to mid 90's, although I grew up on wrestling in the early 70's with Ray Stevens, Pat Patterson, and Big Time Wrestling in the Bay Area.Anyhow, reading Missy's personal and professional life in the lime light was fun, and also to read about the tragedies of losing her ex-husband and the relationship problems that she endured helped to see her as a real person who was learning from the depths of life which leads one to grow, develop, and mature.Finally, the book is a nice blend of the excitement associated with life in the fast lane and coming to terms with the life fans don't see when the camera is off.Brian Jensen, Ph.D."
3,a lively romp,"Missy Hyatt's biography is a little short, but always interesting and entertaining. Though her timeline of events isn't always accurate, and certain prominent events from her career are missing, the book is pretty well-written and candid. It's very comparable to the transcript of a well-organized shoot interview. She chooses to name names in circumstances that are quite unflattering, but should the reader expect something less? Essentially, the result delivers what is promised. Missy Hyatt: First Lady of Wrestling will be a hit with wrestling fans, but not with some of the wrestlers or other athletes who are portrayed in unfavorable and embarrassing ways. It's a kiss and tell book, done with true relish."
1,Blasphemy!!!,I would just like to add my chagrin to the rest of the fans of this book. This cover is ridiculous.
1,Insulting cover image.,"Attention, publisher: This is one of the most offensive updated covers I've ever seen. Anne is not a blond 20-something model. She's a skinny, eleven-year-old girl with red hair who wears dresses, not Abercrombie knock-off flannel shirts. You should be ashamed."
1,Seriously?,"Wow. Way to take an iconic Canadian heroine from a classic children's series, and turn her into a reject from 90210.Anne is a redhead, and 10 years old - integral pieces to the story line. To have radically changed the imagery and oversexualize a character in a children's book is nothing short of irresponsible.I urge EVERYONE to read this series of books, but I equally urge you all NOT to buy this copy. Don't encourage morons to make more bad decisions and destroy more cultural icons."
1,Terrible Representation!,I can't believe this cover! The artist and publisher clearly never read the book! What a disgrace to Anne and everything these books represent.
1,Ridiculous,Anne of Green Gables has always been one of my favorite stories - I read the book regularly and recommend them to my students. I am very disgusted by the cover I see presented here. Not only is it an inaccurate representation of a well written heroine but it is a sexualized version of a character who we first met as a child. Shame on the publisher. I hope that someone involved in the making of this sees the error of their ways and pulls this from circulation. Horrible!
1,Seriously.,"If you are going to sell a book, read it first.. Anne is a redhead. ridiculous. You could even look at any other edition of this book for a clue."
1,Travesty,"The original Anne of Green Gables series is absolutely brilliant. Whoever made this cover obviously hasn't read the series which would make me SERIOUSLY doubt the quality of the product. She's is a RED HEAD, it's central to the whole storyline! The PROPER cover is here: [...]"
1,RED HAIR,"Anne of Green Gables, as other reviewers have pointed out, HAS RED HAIR. These books are timeless and wonderful, but this cover makes them seem cheap and trampy. For shame, cover art editor!!!"
1,What happened?,"Did whoever put this new set out not even READ it? EVER? Who would not know that Anne of Green Gables is a skinny RED-HEAD?? It's a great series to read, yes, but get a REAL version of it, and don't waste your time with this one...."
5,Anne- A Most Kindred Spirit,"For anyone who enjoys a flight of fancy to sweep you off your feet, this is a book that I can testify has done it! Anne is a 13-year-old orphan, who, by mistake, ends up being adopted by siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert. Matthew is a shy, delightfully understanding man, whereas Marilla is a hardened old maid. Thank goodness Anne has a knack with people! This tale is chock full of stories of Anne's successes and misfortunes. And, oh, what dilemmas she has a talent for! She is a charming person, who becomes your friend after just a few pages! This book is one of L.M. Montgomery's best! (And, if you enjoy the book, be sure to see the movie, as well!)"
1,Why change the image of Anne?????,"Beautiful story of a young redheaded girl who is a great role model for many young women. However, why is Amazon selling a version with this cover? Didn't anybody at Amazon and at the publishing company notice that this is not the image of the character of Anne, who has her red hair and braids? Why is this blond model used for the cover? What message are you trying to say by replacing her and sexualizing the cover? Amazon, you should remove the book with this cover and honour the beauty of the Anne that was written in the book!"
1,Shame on the people responsible for this cover!!!!!!!!!,"The Anne everyone loves is definitely not a blonde and then to add insult to injury .... the ""look"" on her face ... really????? What were you thinking ... not much apparently. You owe the family of LC Montgomery an apology.Love the book, but gave the cover a one star rating, which is still too high."
1,STINKER of a COVER - utterly ridiculous,"What else needs to be said? This cover must be a joke. Why not just put Kate Upton in a Victoria's Secret bra and panties perched on a haystack, and be done with it?"
1,That is NOT Anne!!!!,Anne is a Canadian treasure and that is definitely not her on the cover!!!!These are classic childhood novels about a young red-haired girl and to reprint them with a cover that belongs on a harlequin novel is not only ridiculous but offensive.
1,Publisher has never actually read the book,"The book is brilliant. The cover is so blatantly sexualized, it's ridiculous. Anne was a red-head from the early 1900s, not a blonde from 2013. Buy the book, but no, please lord, NOT this edition."
1,the cover is a crime!,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review about a book. 5 stars for the content of the book but like many others here I find the cover in very bad taste. A blonde seductive young woman wearing a shirt? Who came up with that idea? Anne has red hair, pigtails and freckles and is a child at the beginning of the series. This cover woman wouldn't even represent Anne at the end of the series! I understand that publishers need to create covers that will attract the attention of their readers but who are they trying to attract? Teenage boys? If so, they will be sadly disappointed. I hope this publisher doesn't have rights to any other classics. I wonder how they would represent Laura in Little House on the Prairie?"
1,This Book Cover: A Haiku,"Anne of Green GablesNow flanneled blonde turning tricksWhat fresh hell is thisIn all seriousness, this is the worst thing I've seen since Bic's Pens For Her. I have a sneaking suspicion they got that picture off a free stock photo site."
1,Anne's Hair is RED,"This is a horrible cover and a terrible way to portray this book, Amazon if you want to keep customers pull this cover! I would have given it a negative rating if possible"
1,Poor cover for a great book,"I am not usually one to get up in arms about the way characters are portrayed on book covers. After all, there's usually much left to the imagination and I wouldn't try to enforce my own vision as correct over another. However, this cover seems to miss the mark completely."
1,Ridiculous cover. Buy another edition.,"Anne of Green Gables is an exquisite book, ridiculously misrepresented by this cover. Anne is red-headed (a pivotal characteristic in the series), eleven years old when the series starts, and as a Victorian child and Edwardian woman, probably never wore a plaid shirt in her life. Do not support a publishing house so blatantly ignorant about the books they publish as to approve this designer's cover."
1,Seriously?,"This is an absolutely horrible a cover for a dear series of books. The publisher should be ashamed. Can the publisher even read? How dare they do this. Anne of Green Gables is a story about character. She is a character, one of the best ever created, and she has character. She has a constant desire for self-improvement despite her red-hair which she always sees as a hopeless flaw. How could someone cheapen this series in this way. Sad and pathetic and horrible and appalling. (It is also too bad an item can't be rated as zero.)"
1,Not this version!,"Don't buy this version! Anne is a young girl with RED hair, and it has a big impact on her life. This cover is false advertising!"
1,What have you done???,"Anne Shirley has been an inspiration to generations of redheaded girls. Who is the girl on the cover of this book? Certainly NOT Anne! As a redhead (and the mother of a redheaded 13-year-old daughter), I am outraged! She looks like some Disney star, not the heroine of a classic work of literature. Maybe whoever came up with this idea should actually read the book!"
1,All she's missing is Fabio,"I love Anne of Green Gables. I've read the books, watched the movies, wanted to dye my hair red in honor of her. This cover is ridiculous. It looks like porn or one of those stupid romance novels (not implying that there aren't smart romance novels). All she's missing is Fabio. I won't be buying this series and in fact, I'm going to be boycotting the publisher. Buy the books but not this edition."
1,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the cover","The series is, of course, wonderful. Who wouldn't like a fiesty REDHEAD who finds her places in the world of PEI? The cover of the series is a travesty and whomever ok'd it should be fired as they are clearly very bad at their job."
1,Does Abercrombie know you're using one of their photos for your cover?,Seriously ridiculous!!! It is hard to believe there is actually a marketing/art director who apparently thought this would be a great way to get today's kids interested in this classic book.
1,NOT THIS COVER!,"The _Anne of Green Gables_ books are wonderful, but buy another version. Anne is not sexy, or blond. She's a prepubescent, physically-unimpressive red-head who is impetuous but hardly sultry. The contents of these stories are very appropriate for kids, but you wouldn't know that by looking at this cover. Judge this particular book by its cover and buy _Anne of Green Gables_ in a different edition!"
1,Disappointed in Amazon,"I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's decision to put this particular image on a book that is aimed at younger children. Besides the fact that the cover does not reflect what the book is about - a 13 year old red-head living in 19th century Candada-, this image is despicable in sexualizing a young girl. This is a book and not a marketing ad, and books can sell by themselves- especially wonderful stories by a well loved author- and do not need sleazy images to promote them. A book should be judged by its contents, and not on its cover. Shame on you Amazon!"
1,Anne is a redhead!!,"Did anyone read the first page??? Anne is a redhead! This is insane! I'm so angry and very disappointed in you, Amazon. Whatever just-out-of-high-school little jerk you hired for this should be taken out back and shot!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THESE BOOKS!,"Love the books, HATE the new cover!! What the heck?!?!? That girl on the front cover of the new books is NOT Anne Shirley. Anne is a redhead. With freckles. Who is 10 years old at the start of the series. And no way a young girl of that era would wear button down flannel farmer boy shirts and let her hair be loose like that. And the sultry gaze? Really? Did the publisher or cover artist even READ the book? Do NOT support this unnecessary, sexualization of a classic story of a strong, intelligent young girl!"
1,BAD COVER CHOICE,This is a horrible case of how badly publishers can misrepresent the story. Anne is classically a redhead. That plays a huge role in what makes her character so endearing. This is an unfortunate misstep.
1,"If the choice were LESS than one star, that's what I would choose.","My guess is that no one at this publisher has ever read ""Anne of Green Gables."" To get the cover so wrong makes me wonder what they have changed on the inside as well."
1,Go buy this series in ANY OTHER COVER at your local second hand bookstore!,"I have read the entire Anne series numerous times since childhood and in 25 years of seeing different covers come and go - I am absolutely flabbergasted that someone thought this was a good idea!! L.M. Montgomery made publishers redo the art years ago on a cover of Emily of New Moon because the art department tried to put a full moon on it...how do you think she would feel about a blonde, adult Anne in a men's shirt fluffing her hair in the farmyard. While the books will always be on the favourites list for me...I will never buy anything that CreateSpace has had a part in!"
1,Are you on crack?,All I can think is that the graphic designer and publisher are abusing heavy drugs--because I hate to think anyone so stupid as to produce this could actually get a job when so many are out of work. This cover is a disaster and a shame.
1,Who's the twit that approved this cover?,"I love this series and have recommended it to friends around the world. I am disgusted and completely embarrassed that someone took the liberty to turn Anne into a sexy kitty blond. That person has obviously never read the book because they would know ANNE IS A REDHEAD! I can only think that Amazon is trying to tarnish this Canadian icon for some reason as this cover is still up on their sites even after all the negative comments. As a Canadian, book reader and a lover of these childhood stories, I am beyond insulted!"
1,This book cover is like giving Canadian history the finger.,"This book cover is an absolute disgrace. It is disgusting. I lived in PEI for 3 years as a child and I am offended on behalf of all East coasters and all sane people everywhere because of the sad fact that this was EVER allowed to exist. Blonde? Sexy eyes and pose? RIDICULOUS. A travesty to Canadian history, and I am outraged.This is the first amazon review I've ever written - I just couldn't stay quiet."
1,"Offensive, inaccurate... DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION","I have read all the Anne books dozens of times in my life; these stories are a part of my childhood. They are also classic Canadian literature, set in the late 1800's, about the life of a ten year-old REDHEADED LITTLE GIRL. Through the series, Anne grows up and has many adventures; at no point do they include a platinum dye-job and a cover shoot for Cosmo. The publishers clearly have never cracked the cover of this book.The powers that be at Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. And judging by the vast number of negative reviews of this item, I'm not the only one who thinks so."
2,"Good book, what was the publisher doing??","This series is a fabulous story of a young red head growing up and finding her place in the world. I recommend it to anyone, but not this version. The publisher has clearly misprinted the cover or lost their mind. There is no sexed up blond Anne in this book. Ugh!"
1,Who Did This To Anne?,"Anne Shirley: heroine to many girls since her debut in the early 1900s, born in 1865. Praised by Mark Twain. One of the first girls in her hometown to go to a university. Started teaching school at 16 years old. Published authoress. Winner of the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder prize. Winner of the Avery scholarship. Served as a principal of a girl's school in the 1880s. Married a doctor at 25. Lost first child; stillborn. Mother of five more children, one of whom died in combat during WW1....So who's the random chick on this cover?"
1,"Amazing Books, but what were they thinking for the cover art.","Anne of Green Gables: one of the most amazing book series of all time in my opinion. Where something good comes of a tragic situation. And someone overcomes being told she is no good.This cover art, is a) degrading to Anne's character. She would have NEVER in a million years looked like that; considering the time, and era the books took place it. b) the most ridiculous thing Ive ever seen in my life. and c) you can tell the person who designed the cover art has never read the books. I hope NO ONE buys these copies, and makes the conscious choice to find a better set.http://www.amazon.ca/Anne-Green-Gables-L-M-Montgomery/dp/0770422055"
1,Anne IS A RED HEAD,"Anne is a red head. Growing up with this series, I constantly read this book. Being a Canadian myself, and ALSO A RED HEAD, she is my favourite character. I do not like this 'outrageous cover' and REALLY? A book for young ladies and THE MODEL IS POSED IN A SUGGESTIVE MANNER? Seriously! Also, the book is set in the late 1800s! Haven't the publishers read the whole series! Any children I buy this book series for wil not be getting this copy. I will puchase another copy! PLEASE REMOVE THIS HORRIBLE COVER!"
1,50 Shades of Green Gables,"All I can hear is Cher from Clueless squealing MAKEOVER in the background...and suddenly, Anne is a daytime soap opera star about to fall in love with her ex-step-brother's identical twin."
1,"Wrong cover,favorite book",This is a classic and you have insulted it with this cover! She isn't even a red head! Did you even read the series? Whoever did this should be ashamed of their ignorance!
1,Boooooo to that cover!,"I love Anne of Green Gables, but that cover is truly loathsome. I hope the publisher doesn't sell a single copy of this craptacular cover. Shame on them!"
1,"Um, really?","Hey Publisher, was this necessary? What idiot decided that the book's protagonist needed to be updated to a teenage whore? For starters, the character Anne is 10 years old at the beginning of the series and redheaded - not a teenage blonde.Don't be an idiot - don't purchase this edition!"
1,"I agree that this cover is extremely wrong, but...","...I'm also concerned by the way some reviewers are attacking the girl in the picture as if this is somehow her fault. She's a pretty blonde girl who posed for a picture, that's all. She's not a whore, or a dumb blonde, or a skank, or any of the other insults I'm seeing. If you passed her on the street dressed in the way she is in the picture, I doubt you'd call her a filthy name unless you were just plain jealous that she's pretty. (There's also the issue of shaming women for how they look and dress, but that is a whole other discussion.)Please, people. Save your ire for the idiot(s) who threw together this trainwreck of a compilation and chose a picture that showed how little they knew or cared about the source material, and leave the poor girl alone."
1,PP4000C IS NOT a Brush Cutter!,The item DOES NOT CUT BRUSH! It would not cut corn stalks WHICH ARE NOT WOOD and it will not cut small Tag Elder bushes.I purchased the item to cut corn stalks in my garden and Small Tag Elder brush from swale areas on my property; I doubt I will get much use from it as it will do neither.
3,Disappointed but not upset,This is a great tool for cutting briars down. It is NOT a good thing to cut small saplings with. Very disapointed here.
4,"Well built, works great","Connected to my troy-bilt string trimmer. Works great. I used the handle but not the neck strap. The blade tears through brush up to 3/4"" with no problem. Works well for what I need and is definitely built strong."
3,"Terrifying to Use, but it Works","My wife calls this tool ""the decapitator"". It terrifies her to see me using it on our overgrown brush. You definitely need to wear protective goggles, and keep the spinning blade away from your feet and shins. Otherwise, it works well at cutting away overgrown brush and young saplings. It's not suited for anything bigger than 1/4"" diameter."
4,Poulan Pro PP4000C Brush Cutter Attachment,I have only used this brush cutter/trimmer twice; so limited experience at this point.I can say do NOT try to cut anything more 1/4 inch or maybe 3/8 inch - it just will not do it.
5,Good electric Prop,Works good for smaller park flyers. Does not flex as much as other plastic slow flyer props of this size.
3,Get it for the performances,"Like many of his interviews, much was unexplained, and what was explained didn't have a whole lot of connection to what was played. But Taylor's performances were captivating, and those of the students were quite interesting as well. What you learn about Taylor's creative process on the DVD will be from listening to the music. Still a fair purchase for new fans who've not gotten to see him live, but a full DVD of him playing would have been better."
2,dud,definitely not the Bear Grylls I know and love from Man vs. Wild. We didnt even make it thru a half hour before turning it off.
5,Really Cute Little Book!!,Really cute little book just packed with pictures!!Was the purrrrfect gift for my wife who really loves her cat babies!!
5,Outstanding Animal Graphics. Everyone loves cats.,This is a unique and colorful book exceedingly abundant graphics and imaginative art. I purchased more than ten of this items because my scrapbooking customers love cats.
2,Coulda been a contender...,"It's not that J.J. Rodgers doesn't give it her best shot in the title role. She's just not convincing as Tara, the last of her tribe, a powerful woman who can kick both male and female butts. She is sent on a mission to escort two whiny, pampered daughters of some honcho through the wilderness, encountering danger and adventure along the way. Although the likable Rodgers can twirl a cudgel stick with the best of them, the fight scenes are badly choreographed, the dialog is tedious and the plot is senseless. Even the scenery is drab and colorless. Skip this saga and hold out for better Amazon fare."
1,"looks good, but don't be fooled.","This compressor worked great for the first few months I owned it, then started leaking air from somewhere under the cover. It was still under warranty, so I brought it to the local DeWalt service center. 2 months late, after not being able to get the right seal and then not having the seal properly fit, it was returned to me. It worked once before it started to leak again. I still used the compressor for awhile and just let it run (since it never builds enough pressure to shut off) and after awhile the compressor overheats and just seizes up until it cools. Reading reviews online, I am not the only person with this problem. I would not recommend this compressor to anyone, professional or not."
3,Always need more track!,We were looking actually for a starter-pack for our nephew this Christmas and figured we could not go wrong with providing more track. We felt Brio was the standard and glad to find this item.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this item in April 2010. I keep two plastic garbage cans in it, and do not even use it as as a rolling cart, just to hold the cans in my windy driveway. Well, it is only August, and it has completely fallen apart. Every week another bolt came out, without even moving the thing. The axles are completely rusted, and it hasn't even seen a winter yet! A lot of reviewers seemed to like it, but I had no luck with it."
3,It's OK,"This Cart holds 2 medium sized barrels and works well, however I don't think it's built to last very long. Feels cheap and flimsy."
4,Solid Cart,"Solid construction, easy to assemble and looks good. Only catch, you have to make sure you really tighten down the bolts and screws so it holds together properly. No big deal."
2,"Well, dated and dissapointing!","I bought this version as a compliment to others I owned. Indeed this is the least satifying. The new digitally remastered pressing by Kultur is very weak. Particularly the second act. Lots of white scratches and a constant flicker from bright to deeper color. I guess the control room guys were out having coffee! The production is extremely dated and odd. The choreography is also odd and for the most part doesn't seem to fit the music. I realize that this was supposed to be a showcase for Nuryeve and he really does show why he became a big star in the ballet world.If you are interested in a better production from Britain, I recommend the Anthony Dowell, Royal Ballet version. It is head and shoulder above this one in most respects."
3,"A bit pricey, but has some decent rotator cuff exercises","Some of this is a bit bogged down in details, but generally offered some good exercise routines for rehab of rotator cuff. The trick is to keep up with the exercises and pay attention to the correct technique if you want to see improvement."
2,Generic,Thought I would learn something. I have tried all these exercises before and they provided little releif. Some good info but you can google more stuff for free
5,This is a wonderful product!,"I bought this sling after reading the different reviews on this page. After reading the instructions a lot of the problems others had were taken care of. For one thing when you use it as a sling the letter ""P"" will turn over and face your shoulder. To make sure the cord stopper does not loosen the instructions tells you to tie a knot in the remaining length of the cord.My son loves to be held. We were in Children's hospital for 10 days and I held him a lot to keep the monitors from going off. So now he loves me to still hold him. This sling allows me to hold him and do other things. One important thing is to play with my 3 year old son."
2,One size does not fit all,I'm 5'3 and this product was not intended for shorter people. I tightened the strap all the way and my 6 month old sat on my thigh were he could easily fall out. I think it would be great for taller moms and dads.
3,Great at the beginning,"I bought this sling when my baby was born. It worked great for the first month. She slept very comfortably in the sling. However it did really hurt my shoulder, neck and back after extended wear. It was worth it to me having her so comfortable. I liked the way the sling can tighten up on the sides to secure them in it. BUT I did notice the straps begin to loosen after wearing it for awhile. Never to the point of being unsafe but at the end of the day she was around my hips. My baby is now 3 months and I do not plan on using this sling again."
1,not designed well,"I bought this sling when I was still pregnant. After my son was born I tried putting him in it but he just didn't seem secure, so i threw it in the back of the closet. When he turned one, I dug it out again, thinking it would work well as a hip carrier,but it is even worse for this! I had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful. First of all, the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone, it is very painful with a heavier baby. I took him out of it and will never touch the thing again."
1,Won't help you in Macedonia,"My wife and I took this book with us for a year in Macedonia. The choice of words in this dictionary was not good for daily life or for understanding newspapers. It was a very frustrating dictionary. We bought better ones in country but they are not easily available in the US. The Cyrillic alphabet information was useful, however. The blurb on the back about ""whether you consider Macedonian a dialect of Bulgarian or a language in its own right"" is by the way a breezy allusion to a major historic controversy. Most Macedonians would find it insulting, and they have suffered enough of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune so that they don't need the extra prickling of this one."
3,Nearly as good as Seriously Funny...,"This seems to be all newer work, more than 200 poems. More last line punchline type poems. Poets delivered in alphabetical order. I’m one-third of the way through it. Many of these poems are adult (read: sexual). Favorites so far: Kim Addonizio’s “For Desire”, Jack Anderson’s “Going To Norway” (beautiful last image), Ginger Andrews’ “The Housewife”, John Balaban’s “At 4:00 A.M. Asleep” (lots of movement in this poem), Laure-Anne Bosselaar’s “English Flavors” (the sounds), Charles Bukowski’s “the tragedy of the leaves”, Lucille Clifton’s “white lady” (cocaine), Billy Collins’ “Embrace” (clever mirror image), Phillip Dacey’s “Squeak” (even the repetition squeaks), Denise Duhamel’s “Ego” (moving last line), Russell Edson’s “Counting Sheep” (sci-fi), and Edward Field’s “Graffiti”."
3,It is indeed a lock but it hardly inspires confidence,"This lock, despite being made by the reputable Kryptonite, feels flimsy. It isn't quite long enough for a lot of bike racks. The key grinds a bit even as a new product which feels a bit like a harbinger of a future untimely break down. That said it is indeed a lock and will prevent your bike from being stolen."
2,design flaw and rust,the bracket was on the wrong side and the lock can not be mounted on the bike that way. the lock worked for about three months until i left it outside in the rain and it rusted inside. now it takes a very long time to open. I wouldn't recommend this lock if you're going to park your bike outdoors.
2,Clamp on wrong side as well,"This is why I never buy anything online! Clamp is on the wrong side. Very, very low budget oversight on their part! Should have read reviews."
4,Pretty good.,"It's a pretty good lock. Feels secure, the only reason it lost a star is because the lock is kinda finicky, you have to insert the key just right and sometimes try several times to open and close it. It can be kind of frustrating if you're in a hurry, but not a huge deal. It's still a quality product. I've been using it every day for about 2-3 months now as my back up and travel lock. It probably gets locked and unlocked about 3-5 times per day as I go to the store and class. I use a huge on guard chain for home and work."
3,Not quite what i expected.,This company makes SOME of thier tapes in USA....not this style though. I had viewed pro-tape's web site prior to looking on Amazon. I saw that they made thier products in the USA. No where in the product description on Amazon did it say that this particular model/style was made in China. Well now I have just another non-american made product. YUK!
2,Missing vital information,"The book summarizes the law but in all of that disucssion there is no chapter on how the government makes its determinations for the ""level"" of the charge. Annoying."
4,Good Movie,"I liked it.....my kids did not, they said it was predictable. I did not think so....I think it was a relief to see a clean movie that taught a lesson ""Don't gain the whole world and lose your soul"""
1,MS-Press screws up again,"Once again MS-Press has neglected to include the CD-ROM key for the 120 day eval version of NT Terminal Server. How many times is MS-Press going to continue to make this exact same mistake. It really is very frustrating.The book does not include any information concerning the actual setup and configuration of Terminal Server. Although the book provides excellent insite into project planning before deployment, it falls far short on addressing installation problems and concerns both during and after deployment. The book is valuable for technical insight to the RDP protocol. There are however much better texts out there; particularly from New Rider publishing"
2,"Innovative design, top piece not large enough",The top section of this just barely doesn't cover my ottoman. I am going to try and find similar material to sew on an extra few inches where necessary.
2,No color,"This book is very Expensive, no color pictures, hardly used it in class. Not worth the pretty penny they charged for it!"
3,Not too bad...,"The book was pretty cheap, had a lot of writing inside but it was worth not having to buy a way more expensive new version. You get what you pay for! I'm satisfied!"
2,NcStar Laser Sight,"I've tried this sight on various airsoft guns including a shotgun. The quality isn't bad, but zeroing it is a nightmare. Also have a BSA laser sight which works much better for maybe a lower price."
2,Skip this one,"I'm a certified sommelier , and if you're looking for a introductory wine book, you can do much better than this. It's organization of topics is awkward and unintuitive. The authors bias towards American (especially California) wine is patently obvious. Wine for Dummies and The Wine Bible are both much better than this book. There are also a few glaring (if you know wine) errors. Also, on a literary note, it's not particularly well written. Major pass."
5,Different but Enjoyable,"Excellent movie! I f your like me and get confused easily I suggest that you watch the series first. The movie is different from the series and many people may not likle the changes of the characters personalities, but I enjoyed the story going in a different direction. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
2,OK,"I thought the story was OK, but the part with Dalandai was absolutely gross. It was to bloody and graphic for my liking. My friend was pretty disapointed by it and she saw the series. I loved the artwork though, it was like being in a dream. Compared to Endless Waltz and Princess Mononke, this movie doesn't even compare."
5,"..(splendid, magnificent...etc)","I bought this movie as a bootleg, when I was a brand new fan of anime in general and didn't know about such things. The movie is totally awesome! It is also violent and bloody (and gory too) so it might now be good for someone with a weak stomach-even if it is animated, it can be pretty realistic! I loved the movie-because of its 'softer' side (Van+Hitomi kawaiiness (cuteness)) and because of the artwork. The artwork is simply AMAZING! I just -had- to buy the movie's artbook, just becuase I was so awed (too bad I can't read much Japanese...). Anyways, the movie is very very very VERY good... and you should SO buy it. All the extra features and whatnot...at that price!--bargain!"
5,Powerful and Insightful,"I found this book to be both practical and insightful. The author has managed to strip away all of the ""consultant speak"" that you often find in books like this, and replaced it with concrete examples of leadership. I have also had the opportunity to attend a seminar conducted by the author and it reinforces many of the fundementals discussed in the book, as well as introduced new concepts. I recently purchased this book for a number of my employees and others I mentor within my organization. I highly recommend this book."
4,Platform for Excellence,"There are 1000 books on the market talking about business success. This book distills all the talk down into the essential principles. Ultimately its all about value-add, delivering results and integrity. An easy read that provides a solid platform."
5,"Straightforward guide on how to ""GET IT RIGHT"".",A great guide for everyone from the CEO on down. Explains key business concepts and how to impliment them NOW. This book gives you information in an intelligent way that that can be easily applied to everyday situations. A worthwhile read...
1,Useless and Pointless,"Dont waste your time or money on this little useless book. I am a CEO, and I am astonished that this book could even be published!"
3,The title is misleading,I was looking for a book that showed how to add color to stamping and this only pretty much covers watercoloring stamp outlines. I would have preferred to have known that is all it was about. I think in that aspect it does a good job. It is a very narrowly focused book that I paid too much for.
1,Not worth your money,This is one of the most difficult programs for burning a CD I have ever used. Take my advice and stay with Easy CD creator. The only way I got this product was my Easy CD creator 4.0 wouldn't work with the XP system. Pay a little more and get a lot more program.
4,Richard's review.,"I'd forgotten just how good James Last is. Didn't take long before I was tappingmy feet on the ground, and whistling along to the songs. Love it. RvT"
1,Peak at its Lowest,"What a Peace of a CRAP! the company who made this worthless garbage should be shot!the unit barley cuts, in fact it could not even trim my beard. The makers should do everyone a favor and go out of business."
4,Great Book Strange Ending,"I loved this book. The ending was very strange but i do hope that perhaps it is leading to another book?..Maybe? Hope so. I tried to find this author online but could not. In the back of the book is a website but when i tried it, it doesn't exist. too bad.Weird weird ending."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"I have ordered countless times from this company and I am in the process of placing another order. I buy different variety of seasoning so I can make my own blend. I just finished making several bottles of seasoning and rubs and I still have the scent on my hands even after washing my hands. The seasoning is fresh and six months to a year later, the seasoning still holds the aroma and flavor of each seasoning and spice that I have ordered. I have ordered this season in which I am reviewing as well as countless other seasoning and I am thoroughly happy with each of my orders. Order a lot so the shipping balances out to nearly free."
4,EXCELLENT EFFECTIVE CHILLER! NIGHTMARE INDEED! THIS IS AVAILABLE ON DVD!,This is another fine effort from the Hammer studios. I had never seen this glorious black & white film until recently. This eerie tale holds up very well and I wish half the horror movies coming out these days had this much good going for them. This is avalable on DVD as part of an 8 films set called the Hammer Horror series. It's a two disc set and all the films included are in their original format. The DVD transfers are very good and the set is around $20.00 A great deal for such an interesting horror set.
3,Okay if you buyt it when on sale,Air keeps going out of the top ring. Instructions stated it would take 10 minutes to fill up - it took 2 hours.Stiil for the price paid got it on clearance for 59.99 at Toy' R 'Us can deal with it.
4,Good set but some missing pieces,"At their peak, there was not a more popular group than Three Dog Night but the start of this 2 disc set includes pre-Dog material that IMO, should have been left off to make room for more TDN songs. Maybe the only exception to this would be 'Roses and Rainbows' by Danny Hutton because it is the only song I remember ever getting any radio play time. ""Celebrate"" is good but it misses the mark by leaving out some of their best material like 'Rock and Roll Widow', 'Chest Fever', 'Don't Make Promises' and 'Jam'. Not perfect for the TDN collector but good enough for those who just want a taste."
5,"Three Dog Night, my very first rock concert (In 1970) and I've actually met all the guys...","I met Danny and Cory after a concert in 2009, and have been in contact with Chuck Negron, via email and Facebook. In fact, delivered a message for Chuck to a former College Basketball Coach that he admired."
5,This book has everything!,"Absolutely everything! When I picked it up, I expected a fairly light book about working from home with small kids around. Instead, this is a book that covers every aspect of starting a business from finding your passion, to setting up a website (and what all those strange terms mean!), to understanding the financials, to writing a marketing plan. It is all here in an easy to read format. Even though my business is established, I have learned a lot! Kristie clearly loves her topic as much as she loves her life."
3,pretty good ppv,when i first saw that they were realeasing a series of like 98 dvds i was very excited but when i recieved it 2day i was a lil disapointed. not with the dvd persay but with hwo it was put together.there r no menus it plays like a normal video. if u only wanna watch like the main event u gotta fast forword through the whole ppv.thats pretty much the only problem. as for that its pretty good
4,My favorite match was The Brood v.s The Job Squad.,"The matches were Oddities v.s The Headbangers, Austin v.s Undertaker(Buried Alive match), Rock v.s Mankind (WWF Title), Brood v.s Job Squad, Venis & Godfather v.s Henry & D'Lo, New Age Outlaws v.s Boss man & Shamrock (Tag Team Titles), Goldust v.s Jarret (Sriptease match including Debra), Owen Hart v.s Steve Blackman.The movie was great I ordered it on ppv on December 13th with my friend, we both loved it!!Then I rented it and it was just as good. When the Oddities versed The Headbangers it was really supose to be Oddities v.s Headbangers & Tiger Ali Singh cause thats what they said on wwf.com.So i really loved this movie and i would buy it if i could."
3,50%O.K./50%BAD.,"Rock Bottom had a terrible undercard.Let me rate it. 1.val venis and Godfather vs.Dlo' and Mark Henry.This match I gave a70 . Barely passing for slow action. 2. Oddities vs. headbangers. I gave it a 85 for a pretty o.k.match. 3. blackman vs. owen hart. 97 for an exellent match. 4. 8 mn tag. 90 for an o.k. match. 5.goldust vs. j. jarrett.it waz kinda short , but 80 for the match. i gave the after part a 90 becuase of the stupid blue blazer. 6. boss man and shamrock vs. outlaws. i gave this mocoire(mo-cure-ri)boring 20 mintes snooze a 0 for slowness , boringness, the list goes on forever! 7.rock vs. mankind. acully this match waz quit alright. 95 for a tiny slow part. 8. buried alive:undertaker vs. austin. 100 for this incredible war!you'll love this match!"
5,Wrestlemania 25,First the Money in the Bank match was the opener great match the best one yet. Then the divas battle royal the best match pf the night Taker vs Michaels. Then Cena beats Big Show and Edge in the triple threat after that Triple H retained his wwe tittle against Randy Orton.
4,Does What It's Meant To Do,Does what it's designed to do very well. Would give it 5 stars if the price were more reasonable. Can't imagine why a small piece of plastic covered by some lint-free cloth should cost this much!
4,Enjoyable for the inexperienced and experienced,"This is a pleasant read. Brought a smile when I didn't expect it. Though it didn't tell me ""how to"" create a beautiful garden it expressed the way I work in the earth. When I leave my tools laying about tucked in the flowers this book showed me others think the same and do the same. Practical info: the chapters are short and you can skip around chapter wise. The book is nicely presented with good quality paper. This would also make a wonerful gift."
3,Decent Dr John CD,"This *is* a Dr John CD, and most all of his stuff is good, but since it is a recording of a set done for tourists at Mardi Gras, it is a set aimed at a bunch of tourists at Mardi Gras. He's not exactly phoning it in, but every song on the CD can be found in a better version elsewhere.On the other hand, if you're new to Dr John, then this might be a great place to start. This might well be a good CD to give as a gift to someone unfamiliar with Dr John and/or the New Orleans sound. I have played it some as background while I do stats. It's nice to listen to, but doesn't involve my attention enough to mess up my stat work."
5,Great quality,"I use these boxes to store all of my ammo, they are built tuff and exstreamly durable. They have groves in the top to make them stackable. These are the better bang for your buck."
2,By-the-Numbers Action Flick,"The blurb reads: ""Big screen superstars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz come together in this fun, action-packed thrill-ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. "" - ""Edge of your seat getting ready to take the DVD out of the player"" is more like it.Knight and Day is a Mission Impossible clone minus the plotline plus the annoying Cameron Diaz. What is it about? Well, its filled with explosions and stupid dialog where nothing really makes too much sense. Cruise bounces around in the movie like he is back on Oprah's couch while Diaz squeeks and squawks as the female lead who starts off as a Brain-in-dish-somewhere kidnapping victim, turning into super-spy sidekick.If there was a decent screenplay to go with all the explosions, then this film would have worked. It relies too much on the non-existant chemistry between Diaz and Cruise.Watch this movie if you are a BIG Tom Cruise fan - but don't expect much."
2,"Rating movie, not Blu-Ray","First of all, I know not of the special features and extras that the Blu-Ray came with. I ended up renting the movie instead of buying, watched it, and was glad I didn't purchase first. Parts of it were fun to watch, but overall it wasn't my cup of tea. I just don't see watching it a second time."
3,Nonsensical and violent but entertaining,"Lots of star-power, action, bullets, and explosions - but a little weak elsewhere. There are planes, trains, and automobiles crashing and chasing and shooting - then exotic locales from Wichita to Boston to Austria and the Azores. There is a lot of gratuitous violence - stabbings, shootings, and vehicle dismemberments. The movie is nicely shot and the pace keeps you interested enough to make it to the end. The plot and storyline are completely nonsensical, occasionally suspenseful, but mostly predictable - but Cruise and Diaz keep it mostly entertaining and occasionally humorous. There are some subplots and distractions -- several loose ends that never get cleaned up by the end - I am not a fan of those. I am glad I did not pay to see it on the big screen - but it is likely worth the price of a rental."
1,I thought it was the movie...,"frustrating to search for free movies and think you finally found a good one, nope, just a dumb 4 min review"
2,Cheesy Action Flick,"The beauty of action/adventure films is that they magically make the impossible seem plausible, and the ridiculous seem believable. However, Knight and Day fails miserably. At times, the action sequences appear to be better suited for a film spoofing the action/adventure genre. The hero-damsel story component is trite and drags the movie down. The movie comes off as a Danielle Steele attempt to write an action film for bored housewives."
1,Simply Awful!,"Wow, couldn't believe how bad this was. Even as a campy ""background"" veg movie, it was mediocre. Action sequences were tedious, story was tedious (and lame). Fell asleep a few times."
3,"Not bad, but not that exciting.",The action scenes were not that impressive. Both Cruise and Diaz could do better; the supporting casts did not help.
2,"Two parts ""Mission Impossible""; one part ""Naked Gun""","..and not not in a good way.2.5 stars.This is a pretty cookie-cutter version of a ""Mission Impossible"" movie except that it obviously doesn't take itself too seriously (at least, I hope that was the intent). The plot is silly and the story doesn't flow well. I'm not sure what Diaz is there for other than eye-candy (the helpless-dumb-blond-thing gets old pretty quickly). If you're looking for mindless distraction, then KaD is mildly entertaining.Not recommended."
2,Average,"This is an action comedy movie and it is not to be takenseriously. It is super unrealistic, so much so that it reallyis a spoof of other action movies.There is a new energy source in a battery invented by a nerdylooking guy, and Tom Cruise is trying to keep the battery outof the hands of the corrupt FBI officials. However, it isnot clear until the end of the movie which side is the bad guy.The chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise is great, andthe acting is good. But, again the time and distance is meaninglessin this movie and it is distracting."
3,boring,this movie consist of diaz being druged half the movie then having her drug cruise did not make sense at all
4,A pleasant surprise,I haven't been a big fan of Tom Cruise for several years but he played this role perfectly. He and Diaz are a great match. The special effects and stunt work are excellent. It's a fun flick (I laughed quite a bit) and well worth a couple hours.
5,VO: Tales and Techniques of a Voice-Over Actor,"I am a new vo actor. A wanna-be. I have a good voice, or have always been told, and was ready to knock everyone dead. I enrolled in a class for vo's and I was horrible. I did everything wrong. I needed to do something. So, I bought Harlan's book, VO: Tales and Techniques of a Voice Over Actor. It is laugh out loud funny as he describes his first days and the entire history of his experience in the business.Not only is it thouroughly entertaining and funny, I learned so much. After I read the book and went back to class, my teacher was shocked! I am sure that prior to having read the book, my performance warranted the, ""You better find a new career choice"" speech. However, instead of the speech, I was told how much I had grown and how funny I was. This is due the book.Buy it and enjoy it!"
1,Just don't get the ending!,"It was a total waste of time reading this book to find out that the author got tired at the end of writing it and simply came up with a random, unbelievable, and incomprehensible ending."
2,Parents should preview before allowing teens to read,"I enjoyed Zusack's other book, The Book Thief, even though it was a bit on the melancholy side (how could it not be, having been set during a war, right?) So since I read mostly Teen Fiction anyway, I thought I would try this new book. I was very disappointed. And to be quite honest, I did not even finish the book. The first few chapters felt flaky and unorganized to me. I tried to keep reading, hoping the pace would pick up, but then got to a scene where Zusack is unnecessarily graphic and goes into detail where eluding to such would have sufficed. Does he think his readers have no imagination? Must a violent portrait be painted in such a manner, especially in a book that is supposedly for Teens?? As a parent and as a teacher, I would never recommend this book for teens. I strongly encourage parents to read the book before allowing their children to do so."
3,amazing til the end,"This was a really great book, wonderfully written, and everything was awesome until the last few pages or so...It was really disappointing that it was just some random guy setting all this up, just to see if he could do it..? Killed his father, made a man rape his wife nightly, and for what? Just to see if Ed could deliver the message? That's kinda unbelievable."
4,Great read for adolescents to adults,LOVED The Book Thief (best book Ivw evr rad and Ive read a lot!) so I moved to The Messenger. Easy and engaging read. What an author! Ill be back for all his books.
3,Disappointed,"If I had read this book first, I never would have read The Book Thief, and that would have been a shame."
5,stooge me anytime,"These other reviews were right, these are the best to date for picture,sound and restored to there full 20-25 running time. Lets here it for Sony and hope they keep it up. One last thing Sony, maybe some bonus materials?"
5,Great? Soitenly!,"It's a no-brainer! Absolute fun from the start, and finally putting out all those other shorts that never made it to DVD in the first place!What's more, Volume One finally ended my search for one short in particular. May I recommend ""Half-Shot Shooters"" and the scene where the Knuckleheads beat up their old sarge! Personal favorite!Got a great deal on this set, which I couldn't find just anywhere in my area!"
4,Great shorts,"I recently purchased the first five Stooge volumes to replace my aging VHS collection. The shorts of this set are funny, however I think the shorts of the 40's era (40-45) are of a higher quality in general. This is not to say that there are no gems of this set as there are plenty. For the best laughs I would recommend most of the episodes from the 1936 year on this set."
