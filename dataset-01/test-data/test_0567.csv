3,Not for AM reception,"Works fine for FM reception , but if you want the news or that sports channel on AM, forget it."
3,Down In New Orleans,Good story and plot. I gave three stars because I have read numerous Heather Graham books and just couldn't hear her voice.
5,The Perfect Gift,"A few months ago, my wife and I bought our first car together and I insisted on getting a stick shift, figuring I could teach her how to drive it in a few short hours. Well, I was wrong, and now my wife never wants to drive the thing. So when I thumbed through this book at the bookstore last week and saw the chapter on how to drive a stick shift, I had to get it for her. And let me tell you, it's been a big help -- we went driving this weekend so my wife could practice what she learned, and she was more comfortable than she'd ever been! I guess sometimes it's easier for people to learn stuff at their own pace, and The Experts Guide was just the ticket. We were both happy to find many other useful nuggets of information, all presented in quick, entertaining bites. Am I satisfied with this book? You betcha...now my wife can drive herself to the grocery store!"
4,"Great book, lousy cover","I got two copies of this book for those impossible to shop for people. What you can't tell from the picture online is the insert (yellow section) of the cover is actually a square cut out of the blue dust jacket. Both of mine arrived from Amazon ripped, one very badly. This is a great gift, but if you are getting it at the last minute, opt for the pick up in store option just to be safe."
4,seaman strikes again...out?,"dave seaman is one of my favorite djs but I would have to say that I'm a tad disappointed with this mix. For those new to dance and dj music, great, fine, a good start. However, for the more seasoned listener the track selection is a bit stale, and certainly one can find better mixes in any of the other renaissance mixes he has produced. Still, for the fan of dave seaman, it is a must have. But if you only get one cd from him, check out renaissance 4 the mix collection if you can find it. Also outstanding is renaissance worldwide singapore which also contains an awesome set by david morales."
4,Bonez From Finland,"GReat CD. Nine is wery uneek rapper, his voice is mix of BUSTA RHYMES & DMX. and I dig it Best tracks : Make Or Take & 4 Chicken Wings and Rice (1991)"
3,"A fun, if ultimately pointless, production","What this book does is present a reasonable overview of sixties design in its entirety, from logos and products to posters and chairs. The text is fairly perfunctory but then again, I don't think people buy books of this kind for the words.After the novelty of drooling over groovy icons wears off though, you find yourself wondering what exactly was the point of this book. Many pretty pictures that tittilate you for a short period of time but nothing more. My disappointment may be partly due to the expectations that I had when bought it. I was looking for ideas for sixties interior design for my home and although there are some classic chairs in here and even the odd inspirational interior, ultimately there's nothing here that could be practically used.So basically what you have is just fluff. Enjoyable fluff though."
3,"Flat, but decent","There are two problems plaguing this album. (1) There are no stand-out singles, which might explain why a cover song (Squeeze Box) was used for the first single. (2) The production sounds very flat and muted. These songs sound like demos with some overdubs. That might sometimes be a breath of fresh air (such as PJ Harvey's 4-Track Demos album) if the demos can capture the freshness of a band just jamming on their own, but in this case it is not. The vocals are generally flat (which is VERY rare for Bret Michals), and there isn't much creativity or liveliness in the music (very basic and plain rhythms).Other than these issues, the songs are generally good enough to keep Poison fans (including me) content for a bit. Shooting Star, Get Ya Some and Rockstar are catchy, though plagued by the problems I mention above. But we know what this band is capable of, and that can cause this album to be a little bit of a letdown."
1,Garbage- stop making CDs!!!,"Until I was bored and surfing the internet, I didn't even realise POISON were still going. This dire effort makes me wish they had quit while they were still ahead!"
2,NOT THE BEST THING I EVER HAD?,"This album sounds like it has gone through a tea strainer - it just does not jump out of your speakers and kick your butt! I know this is a silly remark, but that was the impact their other albums had on me (even ""Can't Bring Me Down"" on PTTP). After listening to CRACK A SMILE a few years back (their BEST album in my opinion), this sounds like a step backwards. I like ""Shooting Star"" the most, but this still sounds too much like ""Fallen Angel"" to me!"
3,Big let down after big promises!,"After the nearly flawless ""Crack a Smile"" and the promise of the studio recordings from ""Power to the People"" (the live tracks were [garbage]!) I was expecting a lot more from the Poison boys. The big disapointment is the production. The drums and the guitar are muddy and the backing vocals are barely audible. The other disapointment is the C.C. doing leads on two songs (""Emperor's New Clothes"" and ""Livin' In The Now"") which mimic too closely the ""stuff"" he put out with Samantha 7. The only thing about this CD that makes it worth a purchace is the bonus track ""Rockstar"". This one ranks up their with classics like ""Nothin' But a Good Time"" and ""Unskinny Bop"". Try to buy it used somewhere and save some cash!"
1,PLEASE LEAVE THE BLUESY STUFF ALONE! WHERE is the Rock BAND!,"Please, for the love of god leave the bluesy stuff alone........the vocal delivery, etc...where on earth is the great, punky, trashy Rock band that had more in common with the NY Dolls or the Ramones than Garth Brooks .....Enough is enough.I recomend you check out the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded CD/DVD..for some great energetic rock/metal."
1,Less-than-stellar,"This album serves as one of the only releases of new material by the band in the past decade, and the band shows itself to be no more than a shadow of what it used to be. This pales in comparison to the first three Poison albums--which will always be metal / rock classics--and really lacks anything noteworthy. Honestly, I just can't get into any of this. If this were put out in the mid-to-late 80s--at the height of the band's popularity--it would have been a disappointment then, as well. It just isn't good...nor even mediocre. The only thing that I can say about it that's positive is that it is original (mostly) and new--not a re-packaging / re-working of the same old songs, nor a bunch of covers...which seems to be a trend for the band these days."
5,Bi-Metal is the Only Way to Cut Metal,"Bosch sells other metal cutting blades but they are too soft. I was hoping to find the bi-metal blades in Homedepot and Lowes. For some reason, I was out of luck. After shopping around online, I settled with Amazon. Even cutting with a Bi-Metal blade, it gets hot very quickly. A slow drip of water at the cutting area will prolong the blade life tremendously. Other wise you may want to cut and dip, and cut and dip (in water) to finish the job."
2,Good idea but breaks easily,These blocks are a unique idea but after a while the springs start falling out of the blocks. My son did not find them as exciting has I thought he would because they would pop open before he could finish building anything. Great idea but poorly executed. For the money they are an interesting block to add to his building materials.
1,"Great Title, But...","I'll admit it, the title got me. I probably read two business books a year, and this one didn't offer anything new. Most of it was new twists on the same old rules. It was not inspiring, motivating, or compelling."
5,good service,I love this store. The book is brand new. The mail package is good. I received it in time. I highly recommend it to my friends.
5,How to SAVE Big Bucks and Restore Your Classic C2000,Love your classic LG c2000 flip phone? Performance degraded due to a dying battery? DON't buy from Cingulair . . . it will cost you big time and they may not even have the battery in stock. I bought my replacement OEM battery here from a 3rd party seller and saved big time. My phone is back to its original condition and I'm a very happy classic cell phone user.
1,Buy another Book,"This book is Easy to read being how it only 145 pages. As far as Mastering Java Script you won't do it with this book. The big flaw in this book it THE EXAMPLE CODE DOES NOT WORK. If you are new to JavaScript and you don't yet have the knowledge to start debugging don't buy this book. If you want to buy a GOOD Book with examples that work thats tells you what browser they will work on buy the JavaSript Bible. You will be writing script from the first day with the JavaScript Bible, an Excellent Book and its 900-pages of knowledge. If you buy Mastering JavaSript Part I or II you will be asking for you money back .. I PROMISE!"
1,Piece of junk,"Don't buy this product. I had mine for about one year before I finally figured out that it's junk. All of a sudden during taping a DVD, it stopped working and I now have a VCR tape and DVD stuck in it. None of the buttons will work, it won't shut off, eject, or rewind, etc. The screen reads ""hello"", but the junk 'won't talk to me'. It's going in the trash and I'll never buy another RCA electronic again! I hardly even used it before it broke."
2,Not impressed,I got it in today. Only got one because I wanted to make sure it was worth the money. Glad I did that seeing that the product I received wasnt even the Kerlix by Kendall it was some generic knock off.
4,tru lyrics,"I peeped this cats as a DJ back in '96 when I was DJ for my College radio Station. I got the full album prior to the 97 relase and i was like, these cats are about to blowup. I had a 2 hr mix show 3 times a week and i made sure they were in rotation. thses cats were before their time, like the pharcyde, Sons of men, and Souls of Mischief. i keep them on my oldschool playlist on my Ipod."
3,Longest guard available,"From what I can tell, the #12 is the longest available. Both the #10 and #12 are longer than any of the guards included with my clipper. They are more flimsy than the stock ones for sure, but they get the job done."
5,warm and fuzzy,"This is filled with inspirational stories collected from people of all stripes: alcoholics, stock brokers, actors, bakers, etc. They all triumphed over adversity ... and so can you!!! Think of this as a ""hug"" in book form :)"
4,A review of what I heard live in Detroit,"Howdy,I took my wife to hear NP play at the Max in Detroit on 5/21. The band was fabulous...him, sax, drums, percussion, piano, stand up bass. The command and ease that the players brought to the material showed me not only their skills but their passions. I love music of all kinds that plays on the cornerstones of various styles, and the material off Sonic Trance that NP played was playful, emotional, full of funk. Enjoy"
3,He shouldn't try to be Miles Davis,"Why do young cats try to even touch Miles Davis? Leave the man alone!!! You can't be Miles Davis. There's no point in trying to imitate what Miles was doing in his 70""s electric fusion bands. If I want to listen to that kind of music, I put on Miles Davis. Payton should stick to Louis Armstrong or make his own stuff. All of his other recordings are better than this. You don't expect him to be hip. He shouldn't try to be hip. It doesn't suit him. The music is not bad, but nothing new or exciting. I guess he just wanted to get some airtime on the ""smooth jazz"" radio stations."
2,Feh,"I bought this book back when I was buying every Trek novel that came out. The only ones that beat it for mediocrity are that bit with a Romulan plot to alter history so the Vulcans were in charge instead of the Humans, and the book that tried to turn a medieval-type story into a Trek novel. And that's saying something.It's probably still in a box in the attic somewhere. However, unlike the works of John M. Ford, the Reeves-Stevenses, Diane Duane or Peter David, my copy of Timetrap is unlikely ever to see daylight again, except maybe for a yard sale."
2,Sounded good for about 20 days,I decided to go against some recommendations and try out the HTIB because I'm by no means an audiophile but I like to save money where I can.This system sounded pretty good for about 20 days but then I started hearing a loud hissing sound coming out of the speakers when I enabled surround. It was so loud I couldn't use surround for the last 3 days I had the system.I returned it and have decided to go a different route for my suround sound system.
3,Too much fragrance for really sensitive skin.,"I decided to try these wipes after reading all the great reviews. My daughter has always had really sensitive skin & has gotten bad diaper rashes & yeast rashes since birth & still now at 2 1/2 yrs. old. I have been using washcloths & water & LOTS of diaper cream at every diaper change. I wanted a little convenience, so I tried these wipes & after about 1 day of use her diaper area got red & irritated. I actually really liked how good they wiped her clean & the soft lanolin feel afterward, but I think the fragrance must have irritated her skin. These may not be a good choice for super sensitive skin, like my daughter. I guess I'll have to stick to the washcloths!"
1,More like an art-book,"The information in this book isn't that much as you might think... The title is misleading in a way, it doesn't help to make you more popular, just because the information isn't much! I've read this book in just 30 (!) minutes (the book has 124 pages approximately)... So it's clear the information isn't that much!"
3,Skin feels smooth,"I do like this product. It's rather cheap compared to other microdermabrasion systems and it gets the job done (trust me I've tried a few). You don't have to use much of this and to be honest, I just sqeeze the bead stuff on my hand and rub it in my face sometimes and that works just fine. My skin notices when I skip this. I only use it twice a week, maybe three times."
3,Be Prepared...,"...to not expect much. Not saying it was bad, but it's no Ocean's 11. It's Ben Stiller, not George Clooney...and as far as i could tell, no Brad Pitt. However, that being said, we thoroughly enjoyed it. We paid 3.99 to stream it on a saturday night eating takeout on our couch, which after a long hard week at work, was the best way to spend Saturday night. So in that respect, we were very pleased. My husband did say that if he saw it at a movie theater, he still would have been satisfied because he never expected it to be a fantastic A+ type of movie. Maybe that's the problem with somepeople, especially after paying 11-20 bucks for a movie ticket, 5 bucks on a soda and 9 bucks on popcorn, you kind of expect more than some movies are able to give. Ben Stiller was enjoyable, Casey Affleck is always fun, really loved Matthew Broderick and we really enjoyed the way everything played out. It was a just go with it kind of movie that you can just have fun with."
2,"Nothing to see here, folks.","Boring and predictable. Ben Stiller seems to be stuck playing the same character, where the lesser-knowns were played to better advantage. Wasted $3.99."
2,Tower Heist runs out steam at the end,"I wanted to like this movie, a great cast, a timely premise, but its just a mess of movie with way too many loose ends. The ending (no spoiler alert here) - just left me wondering if the only thing they heisted was an hour and a half of my life. I had to go back a couple of scenes to see if I missed something in the ending that would have explained it better. Just felt like someone said "" two minutes! shut it down and its a wrap"" Stiller equals Stinko lately, with maybe only Adam Sandler with more poor choices. Movies like this are making me forget that he had talent at one time."
3,Tower Heist,"This movie was entertaining, yet predictable. It is worth watching and has some funny parts. I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
2,tower heist,"it was alright. the acting was not that good, and some of the stories line was weak. i will not rent this again."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"So I was searching for a comedy. Something that would make me laugh to end my Friday evening. Ben Stiller + Eddie Murphy...come on right. So the movie was funny at some parts, the ones already seen in the previews, but the plot was better with a few unexpected twists here and there. This movie really kept me guessing throughout"
3,Movie? performance not so hot,"I guess the movie was fine. It kept shutting down about every 15 minutes which was very annoying.Turns out the perseverance of Amazon's tech department found the solution, but I'm not too happy about that.....the Amazon service was terrific, the Panasonic Blu-Ray player was the problem. Turns out Panasonic has an issue with streaming playback via wifi. There is no apparent fix at this time. I bought a Roku box, altho I haven't had a chance to stream Amazon movies thru it yet."
3,Opportunistic,"This is modern-day Robin Hood in which the staff of a luxury apartment complex decide to rob $2 million from the same man who robbed their pensions from them. Alan Alda does a great job of playing the Madoff-like villain, so unctuous and so charming is he at the same time. Ben Stiller and Matthew Broderick are always likeable. The plot and the execution leaves much to be desired, however -- there are so many inconsistencies and holes in the plot that it's really hard to sustain your disbelief. And this movie is too politically opportunistic -- how many more movies do we need where the common folk get their comeuppance against the rich? In this movie, the rich almost walks, and everyone else almost ends up going to jail. In real life, the rich always walks, and everyone else does end up all going to jail."
4,Very Entertaining,I laughed a lot watching this movie. I'm a writer and I usually can tell what the ending will be but they fooled me. Eddie Murphy's character was award winning. His calm manner is sure sign of maturity...or is it? Matthew Bordericks' character is delightfully manic - your not quite sure when or if he is going to lose it. The other characters are just as wacky/quirky. Enjoy.
4,Pretty good movie,"Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy lead an all-star cast in Tower Heist, a comedy caper about working stiffs who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them. Stiller and Murphy bring their ""A"" game to ""Tower Heist"". Josh Kovacs (Stiller)is the building manager in a high rise luxury apartment building. When he finds out that his and all the other employee's penchants are all gone and have been foolishly invested by a Bernie Madoff type boss, Arthur Shaw(Alan Alda). Kovacs and 3 other employees decide to break into Shaw's apartment suite to find the safe and get their money back. In preparing for the robbery, Slide(Eddie Murphy)is asked to help assist in the robbery since he is a criminal. Hilarity ensues as this group tries to pull off one of the biggest heist. Can they get away with it? Will they get caught? Can they coexist together without turning against one another?"
2,Boring,"I'd give the movie 2 1/2 stars. The first half is really boring. The second half is better and I thought the actural theft was interesting. I think this is one of those movies that is good as a rental, one time, but is a waste of money as a purchase. I think the movie is to long so it just plods along. As an Action/Comedy it misses the mark, there isn't a lot of action and it isn't all that funny."
1,shockingly bad,"figured we wanted a chuckle or two and some mindless entertainment for a friday night. This movie is surprisingly bad. terrible dialogue, implausible plot, and a complete waste of talent. I read the poor reviews when the movie came out so was not going to pay theater prices - but not even worth $3. Had more laughs the next day mocking the plot and mimicking the ridiculous dialogue than actually watching the movie."
2,not really good,"Some laugh out loud moments/lines, but very ""meh..."" Totally a ""b"" or even ""c"" movie. A lot of preamble leading to a not too interesting heist and a way boring ending. Alan Alda was sufficiently creepy but the rest of the cast never gets a chance to really shine or do anything non-cliche. Eddie Murphy's character just kind of fades away at the end. I dont recommend it."
3,Has its moments,"Well I thought the movie lived up to expectations.A comedy twist on getting back at a Bernie Madoff type schemer. I think that the story leaves a little bit to be desired (they didn't close the movie very well), but what did you think you would get?I laughed out loud several times, I felt for the characters, and I was entertained.Don't expect an Oscar-worthy performance, but if you want some cheap laughs, it's not a bad choice."
4,really cool,"I really liked this movie. It is funny, there is suspense, you do not get bored, the actors are all really good actors anyway and they bring their talent to this movie."
1,Time Heist,"I watched this with my wife over streaming video and had no issues with that luckily. However if you want to get a terrible I love New York movie that just bores you to death then this is the movie for you. Not one part of this movie was good and I personally felt responsible for the worst 2 hrs I have spent with my wife watching this awful movie. I hope you dont get this movie and for those people who put 5 stars on here, they must have been on meth or something."
4,Cartier:Creative Writing,"I first thought this book was just another brand-name book which displays its own achievements . But then I realize that this book is an excellent and comprehensive account of the history of writing tools, be they from the East or the West. What has carried me away is the history of items like pen holder, paper knife, inkwell, etc...it makes me realize that every object in the world has its own invaluable meaning and deserves its own dignity . In short, the book is an indispensable eye-opener."
3,Design Needs Improvement,"I was surprised that the clip is difficult to open/close with 1 hand and the strap itself is not durable. It is secured by a seam with thin plastic! I was willing to let that slide. I got the midnight blue and love the color instead of the basic black. The material is nice and thicker than your average tank top. Unfortunately, the bulls eye part bunches up and shows through. I ordered a size up after reading the reviews. I tried using my disposable nursing pads to determine if it makes it smoother but that didn't work. I'm glad I got the midnight blue as it is not as obvious but I will not wear this tank on its own!"
2,Not worth the price,"The snaps aren't quick to undo, which is one important thing for nursing tank tops. The nipple holes get in the way when pumping. Overall, it wasn't worth paying $44 for this. I could have bought 3 nursing tank tops for this price."
3,Runs small,"Love the length. Its really hard for me to find tops that are long enough and this is perfect. However it runs way small. Per their sizing I should be a medium. Medium was way to small, I ordered a large, also too small and now Im going to try an xl. its upsetting how much time it is taking to get the size right, and Im hoping they will take the return of the medium ( i just read a review that said the customer service is bad) but I have be unable to find any other nursing tops that are long enough for me. The tank is pretty heavy duty (arguably too much so, very thick). I think it will be great once I can get the size issue sorted out."
1,waste of money,"Poor quality, not true to size, TERRIBLE customer service. Would NOT recommend this company or any or their products!"
3,Compact little book,I hoped that the book would contain more insights about different breeds as a puppy and less about the general knowledge of having and training a pup.
2,Poor quality,"The cubes in the picture are exactly what I had in mind. The price should have said something. The walnut is a thin veneer with a partical board filler. If you are not handy don't buy them. The wooden assembly rails were not placed correctly. Had I built them as is, the corners would not have been flush. I had to add spacers and re-drill in order for the cubes to look like the picture. (big pain!! especially since I bought 2) Once modified, they look as I hoped they would. Would not do it again."
5,Super storage cubes,"Since all the bad reviews are old, I just want to update the review and say that these cubes are GREAT and of decent quality. Perhaps the company took notice and improved the quality. They are not solid wood or cheap particle board, but they are veneer wood. Going with the price and the free prime shipping I took a risk and I am glad I did. I got two of them, they fit perfectly with my decor and just what I needed.They were extremely easy to put together, one person can do it in less than 10/15 minutes, even if you are not handy at all. The holes for the screws sometimes are not aligned (as is the case with mass produced furniture) but nothing that would make them wobbly or not fit properly, a little wiggle here and there and voila!!!I HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a fine looking piece of furniture on a budget.Since I just got them I cant comment on durability, but I own other similar quality furniture and if you take care, these things last for years in my experience."
4,Good helmet at a good price,"The order was shipped promptly with no problems. The helmet sizes do tend to run a little snug, so go bigger rather than small if your measurement is borderline."
2,not very many likeable characters,"I got the impression that the author was trying to make her two main characters likeable, people you could feel sympathy for, but mostly they were just annoying. Rand T'Ash was the worst, and I really wonder why Danith ever fell for him. I've read several romance novels with arrogant male characters (for example, every Dara Joy book), and I liked a lot of those, but Rand didn't have any likeable characteristics that I could see, other than the fact that he was gorgeous. That's not enough. The only reason I don't give the book a one is because of Zanth, T'Ash's feline Familiar. Owens does a brilliant job with him. The best dialouges were the ones where someone was talking with Zanth. This author should really stick to writing cats."
2,"Ok, but not that great....","This book is really boring, and obvious. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because the back story of Celta is pretty good. What a shame, this could have been a really good story if written better."
4,You Can't Sell and Manage Sales without this book!,"This is one of the most helpful sales and sales management tools available in years. The authors help you diagnosis your challenges, and your sales forces challenges. Identify where many of these may have come from, and then the Rx to help yourself and your people.It was amazing to me to learn that most of the challenges we were facing had actually come from previous sales management, executive and training/consulting that was skewed from the very call reluctance challenges of these same ""experts"".Even if your company or sales management force doesn't embrace this program and provide it to you as an individual sales person - get this book, read it! It can make all the difference in what YOU want to accomplish in YOUR career in sales!"
4,Good Information BUT,This is a very good book but it has parts that are in-depth and one can look at in many different ways. You must be willing to read and put into use the information and learn methods to help yourself.
1,Pendantic and petulant,"This book starts off with a lot of promise, but soon the reader gets bogged down in what is obviously Dudley & Goodson's serious inferiority complex masquarading as disagreeable, put-downs of sales gurus and anybody else who disagrees with them. Their smug cuteness really distracted me after awhile. Their approach to the problem of call reluctance is negative and patronizing, referring to salespeople with prospecting problems as ""infected"" and ""toxic"" individuals. The so-called prescriptions are complicated and esoteric beyond description. The research chapter was disjointed but interesting, in spite of Dudley & Goodson's arrogant assertions that only people at the author's intellectual level would understand and appreciate it. Dudley and Goodson could have used a good editor and writing coach for this vanity press re-release."
2,Questionable and likely fraudulent scientific work,"I have read two thirds of this tomb and it's a bearable read, sometimes even an enjoyable read due to the biting and caustic sarcasm used to describe ""oppositionals"" which basically describes anybody who does not agree with the authors point of view. However I have deep reservations about the authors scientific merits...it casts a pall over the authors authenticity. However with that said, he does cover some interesting ground. The idea of call reluctance being a multifaceted problem I believe is original and stimulating. My only concern is that the author is a hack pretending to be a scientist. However even if he is his work is not without merit. I found the ideas advanced thought provoking."
5,32 year old still remembers,"This was the Best book that my parents introduced to me at an early age. It helped make sense of the the world of ""emotions"" and ""morality"". I'm 32 and most of my friends are married and have kids. This is an excellent Book to get them for a gift."
5,A Wonderful Play -- and with substance!,"I disagree with the reader who said there is no substance in this play. Certainly, all works of good literature have substance, espcially this one. One of the great aspects of A Midsummer Night's Dream is the fantasy that the characters are led to believe. Compare this to As You Like It, where the only fantasy is the fantasy that characters want to believe."
5,Swing like a plo,Very enlightening and informative book that really makes one think about things in a constructive manner.The drills are easy to do and really address targetted problem areas (of which there are many :-) )Easy reading and puts everything into sharp contrast. Really refreshing to have things explained from a factual and easy to understand standpoint.* * * * *
4,Excellent explanation of golf swing,"As a beginner to golf, I wanted to understand exactly how the golf swing is constructed. This book does this and more. It explains exactly how to execute various components of the swing and gives drills and exercises for each component of the swing. I've already put a few of the suggestions to use with good results. If you want to understand the details of the swing, this is a good book."
4,Rescue,"Thought this book would be very technical and boring but Mann puts everything in simple terms to aid understanding. Helps to dissect the complexity of the golf swing to clear and easy to understand, absorb and most importantly .... duplicable steps.Thanks ............ now I would be able to increase my drive and shots."
5,The Book for the Pros,I am a PGA Tour professional golfer and recommend this book highly. Not only does it clarify the sequential movement of the body and club but it does so in a very precise and well-explained manner. Now you will know if indeed you are in correct positional movement throughout the swing. Nice work guys.
3,Could be much shorter,"I think information in the book is very valuable but:There is lot of blah blah to fill blank space.It is also one big advert. It is trying to sell you personal lessons with their software. I would expect you could buy the software, or it comes with the book...Anyway, if you are patient enough and can survive LOT LOT of marketing and filter valuable info, you should buy the book. There definitely is valuable info."
1,"DIDN,T WORK FOR ME","PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND APPLIED IT BY DIRECTIONS @THE END OF APRIL;;;IT DID NOT WORK !!!! APPLIED SECOND TREATMENT AFTER FINDING JAPANEESE BEETLES EATING MY TREES END OF JUNE BEETLES STILL THERE AT END OF JULY ;;;STILL NO GOOD;;;I CANNOT RECCOMEND THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT, TOO EXPENSIVE NOT TO WORK;;;I RETURNED TO THE USE OF SEVIN;;;AND HAD GREAT RESULTS AS ALLWAYS"
3,zipper weakest link,"This is basically a good bag...not great, in my experience. When it is loaded, it is difficult to stand upright. The zipper completely failed at the base end of the bag, and so that made it even worse as you could not store a thing in that zipper less bag.I think you can do better"
3,"Good, not great","I travel all over the world for work, and I'm away for 3-4 weeks at a time. I have to carry a variety of clothing types and shoes: comfortable, office clothes and work coveralls with hardhat and steel-toe boots. This bag will definitely hold it all, but you can easily pack over the airline weight limits. It rolls well and it is durable in all respects.Drawbacks, which are annoying but can be dealt with are:1. Bag does NOT stand on its end well.2. Bag tends to tip or roll over to one side when pulling it behind you2. No dividers in the main compartment, and no straps inside or out to compress the load so it doesn't shift inside.I have since done much more research and found a bag from the same manufacturer which overcomes the drawbacks:High Sierra 32"" Drop Bottom Wheeled Duffle"
1,Flimsy construction,The main compartment zipper ripped away from the bag fabric on the first trip that I used it. I use mainly soft shell baggage and this is the quickest I've had a failure on luggage.
4,We love this show!,"My husband and I started watching this show when it first debuted and saw so many similarities to our own lives, we had to own the series! We really enjoy laughing about it!"
2,Missing ALOT from 1st season!,Wow! what a disappointment this was. Apparently whoever was in charge of this compdidn't think it was worth putting the ENTIRE season on it.....
5,Melissa is Marvelous,"Ever since ""The Gilmore Girls"", I have had a love affair with Melissa McCarthy. She wowed me in ""Bridesmaids"". Loved her in ""Samantha Who?"". Now, ""Mike & Molly"" is just delightful. She delivers the best in everything she does. I recommend this show to those who want the best TV can offer. This show will make you chuckle and warm your heart at the same time."
5,Great instrument!,I decided to buy my daughter a flute instead of rent because of the price of renting versus the great price of this flute. I researched a few different flutes and found this flute to highly rated for beginners by many different sources. We got it very quickly and my daughter loves it!! Great flute!
5,Works as Promised,This flute is good for its price and works as it is supposed to. It is three years old and still as good as new.
5,Great choice!,My daughter's private teacher recommended this flute for her and she loves it. Her teacher said it was a great deal and that it would be perfect for her. The price is great and we are very happy with this instument.
1,80's DVD? (AWFUL),"This DVD was so old school, once I started to watch it I turned it off I was so disgusted the woman are so scary and it did not make any since.. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. I WISH I WAS WARNED!!!! DO NOT BUY JUNKKKKKK"
4,Another great work by Feinstein.,This book is a wonderful story of the 4 majors during one year on the PGA Tour. I only give it 4 stars because I enjoyed 'A Good Walk Spoiled' a little more.
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,This book has 464 pages I had to WD after 200. I just could not take it any more. This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. It was like I was reading old newspaper articles. I kept hoping that it would get better but it never did. Trying to piece together what several players (on separate holes) were thinking at one point in a tournament was ridiculous. I don't plan on finishing the book. Since it still looks brand new it may just be the perfect Christmas gift for my boss
2,Boring and badly written,"Obviously Wurts works very hard to write her novels, which is apparent from her tedious, labored writing style. Her ""outline"" above is so boring that I could not finish it, and shows some spectacularly bad grammar. She needs a good editor, and fast! It is really a shame, for she has some ideas interesting enough to make her readable."
3,"Great story line, but really slow start.","This series has been compelling reading from the outset. Fugitive Prince however lacks the smooth start of the previous novels. Had this been the first book in the series I tried to read, the rest of the series would probably have been ignored because it seems to take forever (well over half the book) before the story really gets moving. The good news is the last half of the book reads smoothly, swiftly and entertainingly. Hopefully, the next installment will have the same swift start and easy flow as the prior novels. Looking forward to October."
1,Not very strong,"I was very disappointed and surprised, it barely tastes like ginger at all -- the cheap ground ginger I bought at the grocery store had a much stronger, spicier flavor. Frontier has a great reputation so I'm guessing this was a fluke."
4,Paint Along with Jerry Yarnell,I thought the author could have included more technique instruction for those learning to paint or desiring to improve techniques. Good use of painting to review.
5,Depends on the participants,The indoor cats are little people in fur suits. I placed this in front of them and they told me to put my toy away when I am finished playing. This animal collected dust.So I took it to the outside cats and they fought over it attacked it pushed it over and drug it in to the bushes. I had to retrieve it for them. Then they slept on it and started over again after the rest period. When it got rained on they played with it wet. One cat bent the spring back until it was sure the toy was dead and when he let lose it attacked him from behind. After several months of abusing the pour innocent kitties the pom-pom started to deteriorate. I finally replaced it; but there are cat eyes peeking out of the bush with a pom-pom mouth.
2,Bad item description,"Because of the meager description of this item on the web page, I mistakenly ordered it for use on my walker, which wasn't a Cosco. But when I received it, I discovered that it was for use ONLY on Cosco walkers. And I had to search the item and box when they arrived for that information that was also meager."
5,FIVE STARS,FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARSFIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARSFIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STAR FIVE STARS
1,Pretty useless,"These neither kill nor trap mice. I've found them tripped repeatedly, but the mice ALWAYS manage to wriggle free. Considering you can snap this on your finger without much pain or any damage, it's not going to do anything to a mouse. Don't waste your time, money & energy."
1,Very Poor,"I hardly ever review items, so they have to be exceptionally good or bad for me to bother. This mouse trap is exceptionally bad. Set it last nite, this morning came to all the peanut butter cleanly licked off and the trap still set. Unless you have a heavy mouse, this trap isn't sensitive enough to be set off by a light, little mouse like the one I'm trying to get rid of. I DO NOT recommend this trap. Besides that, I asked for expedited shipping and to the vendor (not Amazon) that means USPS, which took 5 days to get here. Bad product, bad service."
2,I don't get it. Hasn't worked for me.,"I set six of these up with a dab of peanut better on each. Placed then near mouse poo, hidden areas such as inside the cupboard, behind and under the fridge. Hasn't caught anything. I actually managed to catch one by hand when I saw one scurrying under the kitchen counter, I grabbed a plastic bin and caught it, it was about the size of my thumb, so they aren't too big for these traps at all.In fact, these mice traps haven't had one single legitimate catch. So either the mouse are too smart for it or something just aint working as advertised. They keep snapping each time I pick it up, but apparently not one mouse has touched it. I'm pretty disappointed. I will keep them in place and if anything changes, I will update my review. but for now 2 stars will stand."
5,Mice should know not to come to my house,"I was given a few of these mousetraps last year and found that they really work. So, I just purchased a few more. Some for my house and some I gave to others.They are easy to use and most importantly, do the trick. The worst part is actually finding the dead mouse in the trap. If the traps came with someone to actually remove the mouse and re-set the trap, that would be great! I highly recommend these traps."
4,A intellectually stimulating book,I was very impressed by this book. To many childrens book talk down to children. Hey! Get Off Our Train challenges the childs imagination. Children are capable of a higher level of thought than we give them credit for.
2,Meh,Probably won't be buying this again...may work good for others but NOT this shiny dome of mine. Will try something else
2,not good this time,"I have bought products from Tuga before and I was very happy until the last time, this time the swimsuit became loose and started hanging after only couple of uses. I followed the wash and care instructions as advised for the product."
4,An excellent representation of turn of the century nudes!,"All of the nudes in this book are dated to the late 19th early 20th century. It is an astonishing look at the period. I found the photos surprising, beautiful, and at times humorous, each picture more captivating than the next."
3,bookopoly review,"The instructions were not clear; or perhaps we hadn't played Monopoly for some time,that we'd forgotten the general rules.It was a novel activity for an English class to brainstorm and market, but it did not meet my expectations."
3,"Intel x86 and x88 architecture, not IBM.","This textbook has the burden of being both a reference and a tutorial for 8088 or 8086 assembly programming. This is too heavy of an expectation for the book as it has trouble doing either well.The author attempts to speak to casual and advanced programmers. This proves to be impossible as the author gets into a level of detail that will only please the advanced programmer but alienate the casual newbie.I thought there should be more revisions to keep up with the current generations assembly language. The book focuses on 8088, 8086 when we are on the cusp of ""80786"" with the Pentium II Xeon.Assuming the author is waiting to write a Merced assembly language book, he might be ahead of the technology instead of behind.I fail to see how I can get a job by reading this book."
2,I paid $150 for mine - in 2003 - Too damn much $,"When I first got them, they seemed great - they took out 100% of all the noise around me. The in-ear design cancels high frequencies, the circuit kills low frequencies, and the music covers everything in between.Now for the bad - they get a little uncomfortable after a while, and shortly after I bought them, the stupid volume knob started to have problems. Sometimes the left channel would drop out completely, other times, both channels would dissapear - I pulled out the soldering Iron last night and bypassed the knob. They are still uncomfortable, and the circuit box is always in the way, but at least they work again."
1,Right earbug stopped working for no reason.,"I got these about a month ago. They work great in my office. My office mate constantly has people in the office for discussions. They are considerate, but still distracting. With the headphone in noise canceling mode it was like having my own office.However, they were working great on friday when I left. I came back on monday and the right headphone no longer works. These headphones have had an easy, easy life. Just sitting on my desk or my ears. There is no reason for them to quit working. I am quite sad to see it's a common problem."
2,Not much in quality,I bought mine the first of December and now everybody sounds like they are talking or singing in a well. I liked my cheap Sony headphones but am not impressed with the more expensive ones.
1,our ho;ocaust,This book was very hard to get interested in.I almost quit reading it several times but forced myself through.Very boring and repetative.
2,Too many useless books...,"This book should remove the title ""Complete"" from the heading... prehaps it should read somthing like. ""Just some more useless warrior classes and a few usefull feats"" I actually play D&D regularly and have the main 3 3.5 books and found this book a big waste of time. I have photocopied about 4 pages and inserted them in my players handbook, and found that is all I need... There are too many of these books comming out lately, and they should reserve the use of the ""complete"" word when they can actually write a complete book."
4,This album doesn't lie... these are Quality Kids!!,I listened to this c-d and these kids are awsum!! They have beutiful voices. I fell in love with Landslide sung by my Best friend Jessika Amesse!! These are the best songs you'll hear from kids ever!! Look for the Kids Mix Beatled c-d and listen to # 1 That's me!! I'm only 13!! You have to buy it!!Logan Williams
5,Into the Circle of Life,"The Lost Language of Plants takes the reader on a journey from our innate and ancient connection with the living Earth to our disconnection from it and the ensuing wounds. Then in a coyote sort of way, Stephen Buhner brings us full circle and shows us a way to walk once again, within the circle of life;a part of it, not apart from it. He speaks to the heart of our separation not only from the plants who are our teachers and healers, but from ourselves and each other. Reading the Lost Language of Plants I sensed an ancient and wise place deep within my psyche, maybe even within my DNA, ache for the healing that renewing our relationship with the plants can bring. The truths revealed within the pages of this book are at once compelling and painful and hopeful. This is a must read for anyone who loves the Earth, loves the plants and is not afraid to think or to feel."
5,Amazing Lost Language of Plants,"I enjoyed the brilliant, informative, and even poetical book. It gave me some fascinating information about the environment surrounding plants. It provided facts about how we people and plants need to live with large amounts of bacteria by keeping our immune systems strong. I use essential oils to stimulate my white blood cells. The author is a great researcher and reporter while loving the world of botanicals.Elizabeth Jones, Director of The college of Botanical Healing Arts, Santa Cruz"
1,Unplayable,This is my first RPG game and will be my last.The quest's are nit picking and boering.I had to quit the game after several hours of playing because of the numorus BUGS in the game.One of them being the black screen bug associated with having the Nvidia GeForce video card.My PC more than meets the game recomended requirements but the further I got in the game the more bugs started showing up untill the game just was not worth the trouble.At first everything was great then the black screen problem.A little later parts of the screen would blue out if I turned a certain direction.In battle I would have to run around to a position where I could see the what I was fighting.Anyone who can play this game with a Nvidia graphics card I say good for you but it did not work for me.Well This game finally destroyed my PC before I could finish it.I bought it for my X-box 360 and it played great.
3,Boring,"Its a beautifully rendered world. I saved many screenshots. But the game gets very boring after a few days. This game has everything, horses, individual armors, unique weapons, etc. But what it doesn't have is sustainable fun. You can sneak around and steal the world blind, but 98% of the things to steal is cheese, apples and clay servingware. Ok yes, that is what makes up 98% of the items in a RL house, but if Real Life was exciting we wouldn't be playing RPGs. The little pocket hells that you have to enter are repetitive, and have very little good loot (what it has is heavy and undervalued considering the items come from demons).ESIII has poorer graphics (cuz its older duh!), but a better story and better NPCs. The problem is, I don't have an alternative to suggest since Gothic 3 and NWN2 are also disappointing. At least this still has the unrestricted travel."
2,A great game with one major flaw,"I really liked this game at first, but I couldn't bring myself to playing it when I found out one particular quality of the game. What I am referring to is the fact that no matter where you are, the game difficulty will be appropriately set to your current level. This is one of the worst decisions ever. What is the point of writing a game that is totally immersive and free ranging if you can survive any area you wander into. The fun of playing such a game is the possibility of wandering into an area where you could get slaughtered if you came across some high level creature. You reload and make a mental note of that area and look forward to going back there when you are more powerful.This is just my personal opinion about one aspect of the game. If you don't feel the same way, then this will be a very enjoyable game for you. If you agree, try the Gothic series (Best immersive games I have ever played)."
3,Great designs,I like her books very much. I bought it because of the sweater books . Love the mittens and hats.
4,The Only Pattern Book Knitters Need,"Ann Budd's title might not be glamorous, but it tells it all. The instructions are simple enough for a beginner, but the sizing options and gauge adaptations allow intermediate and expert knitters to design their own projects in whatever yarn they have on hand. Budd also provides clever ideas for adapting her patterns so that no one ever has to knit the same project twice. There is one drawback for the relative novice: the yarn estimates are just that. The range is so broad as to be useless, so unless you are always willing to buy the largest quantity (or unless you are an experienced knitter) you might end up with leftovers in your yarn stash. That said, it is still one of the most useful books in my knitting library."
4,Handy Guide,"This is a great guide for knitting the basic patterns: mittens, hats and even vests and sweaters. Simply knit a swatch and measure your guage, then work your pattern from there. Its easier to use any yarn you like for any pattern instead of patterns that tell you what yarn or guage to use. Very user friendly for beginners and all knitters. And I love the hard cover and the spiral bound pages. It makes it much easier to read patterns while you knit!"
2,cast off on buying this book,"I bought this book and Ann Budd's Handy book of sweater patterns at the same time thinking that this would be a great basic pattern resource.Unfortunately, after trying several paterns from both books the only thing consistant are the numerous mistakes. Fellow reviewers who stated that cast on stitches were too numerous and patterns written backwards are correct. As a longtime knitter my suggestion is save yourself a lot of wasted time and frustration and invest in Elizabeth Zimmermann's books and videos instead of Ms. budds."
2,Unimpressed with scope of patterns and techniques covered,"I have been knitting for a couple of years, and have designed a few simple patterns. I was excited to look at this book, but very disappointed with the extremely basic patterns provided. As well, I was hoping that the book would explain more ways to customize and finish the knitwear projects that were included, but I found that in-depth discussion of these considerations was lacking.The book is great in premise, and might be useful to a knitter that is unable to locate free patterns on the internet, however, I felt it could have been much denser and more useful if more techniques and design options had been included."
1,All that excitement for nothing much.,"Like one of the other reviewers, I bought this book based on the other excellent reviews it had received. I was also disappointed in the limited patterns, but my primary disappointment is that most of the instructions (charts for changing gauges) are printed backwards! As an experienced knitter, I recognized it before trying anything. But that is a major mistake for a book that is supposed to be useful for beginners. It is a shame this mistake slipped by the authors - it could have been a useful book. For those who need to identify the mistakes, look at the charts showing how many stitches to cast on based on gauge. The hat instructions say gauge 9 should cast on 216 stitches - that is one huge hat!"
3,Not enough detail,"This book is only useful as an outline for study by prospective electronics technicians. It glosses over a lot of very technical material, without going into detailed explanations of the technology."
4,Lay It Down Rocks!,"I like all kinds of music but haven't heard much Christian Rock. I really liked this one, not preachy or too heavy on the rock for the most part. I especially like In The Garden and Seen In Me. It's a nice mixture of rock with a good message."
1,Dull and predictable.,I was bored. I fast-forwarded through most of the second half. Tim Olyphant is hot. That's pretty much the only redeeming quality of this remake of a Romero classic.
2,Crazy Land,"Another Zombie Flick that just doesn't cut it and leaves you asking what are the 18 year olds smoking when they feel compelled to write a positive review for a really so-so movie?Shaun of the dead and zombieland,two other snoozers that received high (and I mean,must be high)ratings/reviews.10,09,08,07,06,05,04,03,02,01...""what does that mean?"" When I heard the hot actress radha mitchell ask this (she gets four out of five hard boners),I thought aloud to myself,""I hope it means the end of this horrible movie"" (nothing personal,Babe!).If your not smoking pcp laced dope,you'll be hoping the same thing.The Best Zombie Remake/Zombie flick out there in ten plus years,is ""Night of the Living Dead (1990)"" with Tony Todd & Patricia Tallman.With that said,another twenty dollars thrown away listening to positive reviews on amazon.com."
1,I signed up just to write this review,"This was one of the most contrived, awfully scripted, awfully acted films I have ever seen.A complete waste of money. If anybody involved in this film ever gets to work in the industry again then it is to the massive detriment of human society.If you are reading this and you haven't watched this film, the don't bother.In fact, shoot yourself before wasting your precious time.This film really really BLOWS....Really."
4,The Crazies - Enjoyable Remake - 3.75 out of 5,It's a remake - so the fact that the story hasn't changed much in filming...I will say that I enjoyed it. Not over the top - not bad.3.75 out of 5 stars
3,A Decent Enough Horror Film,"This is a remake of a film by George Romero, let's get that out of the way and in many ways the film reflects that, somewhat limiting itself in scope by trying to recreate a cult classic. Overall this is an effective horror film that gives the bloods and guts viewers what they want while reserving a small section of the film to the more intellectual horror buffs. Overall a decent enough movie to watch once but not something you'll recommend to all your friends."
4,A lot better than expected.,"""The Crazies"" turns out is a lot better than I was expecting. I was expecting a cheesy piece of pulp along the lines of ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Instead the movie is a lot more like ""The Happening"". The plot is simple, the folks in a small mid-west town are suddenly acting very strange. The local sheriff is investigating the situation and discovers a dead pilot and a crashed plane. Eventually the military shows up and all hell breaks loose.The movie moves at a very brisk pace and keeps you interested to find out what is causing the people to go mad. There are several moments that make you jump (even though you know they are coming). The DVD is loaded with extras as well. All in all a really decent movie. Sure it's got some blood and gore, but it's also got a plausible story line."
3,A Modern Day Movie About Zombies,"The Crazies, Fear They Neighbor, is a modern day film about zombies. Set in an unnamed small town in the midwest, this movie features the town sheriff and his pregnant doctor wife, and follows them as they discover that people in their town are turning into zombies and doing horrendous things to other people.And it gets worse: the government gets involved and starts testing the townspeople to find out who has been exposed to the virus that makes people turn into zombies and do horrendous things to other people.Overall, I could not get into this film. It did hold my interest somewhat and the gore was quite gory, but it's not a movie I plan on watching a second time. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good slasher film - kind of like Night of the Living Dead - but set in a current day background and with a bit of government conspiracy theory thrown in."
4,GET OUT OF TOWN,"PROS:*Strong performances esp. Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson*Avoids cliches usually found*A good remake which is rare*The terrifying scenes in the car wash and truck stop*Skilled camera work*The credible relationship between Olyphant and MitchellCONS:*A bit draggy in the middle*Some lack of clarity in the plot*Ending little too nebulous and abruptSUMMARY:Effective remake; a good horror entry."
5,Snakes Alive,"Although it's ostensibly a story about a monumental (monty) Python, this book is a rewarding entrnace into the gentle, sweet mind of Janann Jenner, the author. I first read it when it was new over 15 years ago and it remains on my short list of all time great fiction.Enthralling, in the way that the four books of Tolkein's Trilogy were, it makes you wish that you had nothing to do but finish it. It isn't a short book, but you won't want it to end."
4,Excellent fantasy story line and character development.,I really enjoyed the story and characters. I could seem to relate to them even though they were animals. The author really gets into their heads.
4,"Good quality, helps my eyes out a lot","A couple of days ago, I began getting headaches which I think was because I use the computer nearly 12 hours a day, sometimes more. Desperately searching for a remedy, I came across someone talking about ""computer glasses,"" which I had never heard of. After looking at some cheaper ones on Amazon, I decided to buy this one since it had all good reviews.The glasses frame is kind of chic, kind of like the typical square black frames that was popular a while back. The glasses don't make a huge difference when I first wore them, but in the long term I felt like this really helped with eye strain. I gave it 4 stars because $38 isn't the cheapest but at least it's good quality"
2,Did'nt work for me,"The concept is great, and I am sure these will help some people. But they did not help me, they may have even caused more strain; I slowly noticed that I would frequently take them off and rub my eyes. Perhaps this is due to not being used to wearing glasses. For the cost I would say give'em a shot. Another option, which I will try, is lightly tinted sunglasses. These may also be used outdoors, unlike computer glasses. Also, there are several adjustments that can be made to your computer monitor, such as reducing brightness and colors."
1,Don't notice a lick of difference,"Not sure how this helps with anti-glare or preventing reflective light, I work in an incredibly lit environment and have been using these for a month with almost no difference what-so-ever. I don't think they do a single thing."
4,actually work,"i bought these for my wife. she works at a computer company and looks at a screen for 7 - 10 hrs a day. she came home with headaches all the time. i found these and she has not had one since. she uses them, i know because she talks to me with internet video and she is wearing them. she does say her co workers think they look a little funny"
3,Good But Songs Are Different Than Cassette Version,"I bought this CD last year because I had the album on cassette. While I don't regret the purchase, I am disappointed that all of the instrumental songs which were on the cassette - like ""Toyland"", ""Dance the Sugar Plum Fairies"", and ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" - are not on the CD. Instead, the CD has all of the existing songs which had the Old Towne Singers, with new songs by them.If anyone knows if there is another CD that offers those songs that are missing, please comment."
2,Slow moving and hard to get through.,"I really tried to like it, but I found this book very slow. Maybe it was the audio version the reader was terrible. Although if the material had been good I could have gotten past that. The scenes with Merci and her son did not add anything to this book at all. I feel like they were stuck in to try and make her character compassionate but it slowed the book down even more."
3,Strong Characters,A standard police procedural with characterizations that hold the readers' interest long after the ending is known. Parker continues to refine and expand the police force he has created.
4,Not Bad.,"I saw the movie and thought it was the best movie of 2000. This CD might not be the CD of 2000, but it sure comes close. The problum with this CD is that it lacks songs. I mostly prefer songs and scores to go on different albums. What's different about this score is that you can feel what the charictors are feeling with every note that is played. There is spirit and emotion combined in this CD. The one problum I have with this CD is the songs. Now the songs are good (How could you not love ""The Wanderer?""), but they are placed in the wrong places in this CD. They should have either had their own CD, or wait until the end of the CD until being played. Other than that it's a very good CD."
5,Young Abe,"Young Abe Lincoln is an excellent film about one of the most popular presidents of our country in his earlier life. Henry Fonda's portrayal is astounding and he also looks the part. Abraham Lincoln's life is highly unusual in itself, being self taught in a log cabin by candle light, becoming a lawyer and trying over a thousand cases in his life prior to becoming President and leading our country through the most difficult period of it's existence. It has been noted in history at one time that a mystery woman appeared to Abe's mother and father during his mother's difficult breach delivery when the doctor and midwife could not be located and delivered him. The mystery woman for payment required that he be named Abraham."
4,good begining,"I purchased the dvd to use in between the times I couldn't go to my class. I found it to be easier than my class which was also aimed at plus sizes. To my surprise though I found myself working up a sweat. Even though the eye rolls may seem simple, it is relaxing. I would have liked to see more routines and less of the meditation."
4,Good choice,"I recently bought this camera after I spent a lot of time doing a research that include similar items, and I am very proud of my selection. These camera has very options, it has a great design, sized screen and it is very easy to use. My pictures get clear (have no grains)and the inside flash works excellent, specially if you don't have any other. The only small ""critic"" is the neck strap that doesn't like me because it is very uncomfortable to use and wear, I particulary prefer another kind. Everything else is just perfect."
1,This camera was gray market.,"This product was advertised as factory reconditioned with a 90 day warranty! The product was defective when received. Nikon informed me this camera was gray market with no warranty by Nikon in USA. This supplier should never be used by Amazon. The supplier also did not deliver as promised and did not return my phone calls! Problem was with this supplier, not the camera."
2,Just ok,"I feel guilty for giving this book two stars because everyone seemed to have loved it. The problem I had with this book is that the romance is secondary to the story. Thorn had absolutely no personality, he reminded me of ""me Thorn, you Roseleen"". A barbarian who just wanted to f***. No romance whatsoever. Roseleen was an interesting character but she spent most of her time trying to right the wrongs of the time travel mistakes they encountered. I would to have like to have read more scenes of Thorn and Roseleen getting to know each other, spending time and discovering each other. Too much time spent on a history lesson. (William the Conqueror)Now what I did love about this book was the ending which made the laborious read worthwhile. I did get goosebumps and was very satisfied. Closed the book with a smile on my face. I do love Johanna Lindsey's work so I always find something I like about it."
2,Outside glitz 10 times better than story,"Johanna Lindsey, ""Until Forever"", Avon, 1995. A disjointed tale of Thorn (you know Thor's little brother) and Roseleen (wronged history prof and weapons nut). The set back cover and marketing verbage was almost worth the price. Almost, think Fabio (with dark hair) mostly naked, with sexy clad super vixen tastefully positioned to eclipse his, well you know. Unfortunatley the outside glitz was 10 times better than the inside story. Johanana spends ""Forever"" screwing up history and making meek attempts to fix it. Along the way Thorn's caveman interaction with Roseleen was trying and the ending a little too neat and contrived. I was disappointed, once again Madison Ave. promises but does not deliver."
3,A Try at Something New,"Ms. Lindsey has written a decent book here, but I don't think she should have tried to do a supernatural time-travel novel. I think the characters were well rounded, but there was no villan. Every book needs a good villan to hate."
1,A Love Story It Is Not,"From reading the reviews and the synopsis I was expecting a really great love story. Instead what I got was a history lesson. If I want to read history, I get a history book and not a historical romance. The story was convoluted, disjointed and just plain boring. I was VERY disapointed."
4,If you like this you'll LOVE Knight in Shining Armour,Was a very good read and I'm not usually that into time travel/sci fi romances. The hero was a little lacking intellectually but he made up for it with his loyalty and brawny manliness. I read the reviews here and someone recommended Knight in Shining Armour...I was reluctant but stuck with it and it turned out to be an epic. You will enjoy both.
5,Make your evening very special with the Mica Shepard Floor L,"This lamps brings such a nice accent to any room. It's great for when you have that special person over.The Mica covered shade gives out a beautiful amber, which can offer a very romantic evening.You also can relax after a hard days work,just sit back and enjoy the lovely atmospere of this Mica Shepard Floor Lamp. It's very versatile in any room and adds beautiful accents where ever it stand. Also,This lamp is a great converstation piece."
4,Good for the diaper bag,These are good to stick in the diaper bag so that you don't have to stick a dirty bib in there. I would rather use wipe-able snap bibs otherwise. They are good for what they are. Their closure isn't very strong so if your baby doesn't like wearing their bib they may just yank it right off.
5,Great,We love this new fireplace tool. It's very substantial and simple yet cool design. Looks great by the outdoor fireplace!
4,O.K. dvd !,"The first 3 movies were great, but the last 4 were a total waste of time, not even c rated !!!!"
1,Burt Reynolds 7-Movie Outlaw Collection,I doubt that you will get much response on this offer until prospective customers are able to find out what movies are in the package.
1,buy somwhere else!!,"wal-mart is selling this very same set for five dollers!!!!! don't waste your money!! buy somewhere else!Anne, age ten"
3,A Formerly Great Product Made Worse by Coporate Cuts,"I've eaten these rice sides for probably 10 years or more now, and this Cheddar Broccoli variety used to be my favorite. Unfortunately, a while back, Knorr bought out the Lipton line of rice products and subsequently proceeded to cut costs in any way possible to make more money. This has unfortunately resulted in the previously quite cheesy rice dish being reduced to a shadow of its former self. I bought a box of these because I hadn't had them in a while, and because the Chicken and Broccoli variety still holds up well enough only to discover that the new mix results in a very wet cheese sauce (after cooking in the microwave according to the package directions) that is considerably less cheesy than one would expect. Eventually enough of the sauce will evaporate/soak into the rice & pasta mixture to increase the flavor a bit, but I can't recommend it anymore. It's become thoroughly average in every respect."
4,Approved with reservations,"Always liked Dewalt products so when looking for a Laser Level this one caught my eye. Item is well protected by hard case but first one received was out of adjustment and was immediately replaced by Amazon. Used level to tile bathroom from floor to ceiling. Level provides both vertical and horizontal lines to align tiles for perfect job. Accidently bumbed level which caused unit to respond similarly to one initially received which probably required factory alignment. After sitting for a while unit readjusted itself and appears to be aligned. Overall, I like the unit and would recommend it but reinforce requirement to handle with care to avoid causing mis alignment requiring factory reset."
4,Love it.,Love it. Love it. Love it. simple enough? Only 4 stars because I wish it was a little easier to see in the daylight. Perfect for inside or the basement.
3,No Good in Sunlight,"It's useless on a sunny day, but if you can shoot your outside lines at dusk, then it's fine. Not as accurate as a water level, but way better than a string level or a spirit level on a long board. Get a bright white stick and make a mark the same height as the laser line is from this unit's base and you'll have a much more useful tool."
4,Good Design,"This level is well made and does a great job of shooting a nice clear plumb line. What I'm not as fond of is the magnetic base that this device utilizes. There is an adaptor plate that allows you to attach the level to other surfaces, but even still it's not always easy to keep the level exactly where you want it at all times.It works best when attaching the level to a tripod. DeWalt sells one, or you can use a good sturdy camera tripod as well (which is what I do).A great product when you need a proper line."
5,great tool,I was impressed with the brightness and overall value you recieve with this tool. It comes in a nice small hard case and has the bracket to hang it with in there. It is nice and compact compared to a rotary laser and easer to use. Just push two buttons and sit it down and it is ready to use. I would definetly buy this again.
4,A curious little plant!,"The product arrived pretty late, so I was worried about the health of this little plant, but I didn't have to be. Arrived with a little yellowing on the large cutting leaves, but otherwise sound. There's something about this plant that I really like, but can't quite put my finger on it yet. I think the delay in delivery was the fault of the service provider and not the seller."
5,An excellent food :),Dogs are enjoying it as much as their old 'meat' food in a 50/50 bowl. Plus these ingredients are actually suitable for consumption. I have bought this food before and after this purchase I'm making it the only brand I feed my pets.
1,Don't Bother.,"I can't understand why this is listed on Amazon when you search for 'Succubus' as there is nothing to do with them in this book. Also, it is a reprint of an 1800s author, so the cover art on the hardcover version of this work makes no sense either.At least I only lost 99 cents on this through Kindle and not more or I would be a lot more ticked off over this.AVOID. Nothing to see here."
3,3 stars.,"As a serial killer stalks the city, only one thing unites the victims; all were mean to one woman, Marissa Jamison, the woman a serial killer has identified as the perfect wife for his ideal family. The widowed young mother of two feels a mix of guilt and terror as each body, each with a red bow and gift tag addressed to her appears. Even as she begins to feel new joy with an old love rediscovered, her situation moves closer to danger.*** A total of three plots intertwine in this novel; two romances, between Marissa and Alex and between the two detectives investigating the case; and the murder thread. Though the last is not quite as terrifying as it could be, there is still ample terror, especially as the story climaxes. This is possibly Ms. Cassidy's best book yet. ***"
4,The Moon Handbook worked for us,"We used the Moon Oregon Handbook for guidance on a driving trip from the eastern border of Oregon near Boise, ID, to Bend OR via US 26, (stayed 3 nights) and on to Silverton (1 night) and Portland (5 nights). We appreciated the book's advice to see John Day fossil beds-Painted Hills, the High Desert Museum, Oregon Gardens, Silver Falls State Park. We wished the guide had mentioned the times of services at Mount Angel Abbey. We dropped off the rental car when we first arrived in Portland and never missed it afterwards. Though the book mentions the city's ""excellent mass transit"" it neglected to say that it is free (!) downtown. Overall, though, we were quite satisfied with the scope, accuracy and tone of the book and we loved this slice of Oregon."
4,Randy Quaid was not short of genius as LBJ,This is such a great movie I was glad to hear that Randy Quaid won a Best Actor Golden Globe for his great performance. For anyone who wants to get this on dvd I would check this website because so far it is the only one that makes the dvd unlike those heartless dvd companies. Here's the website; [...]
2,It's not a songbook,"I like to sing along while I play the piano, and I always seek out songbooks. I found this book, and I like several other songbooks in the Reader's Digest series. But this one has no lyrics! Instead of classic songs to be sung, it has simplified piano versions of classical music pieces. Very disappointing."
2,InterDesign Form 2 Stainless Steel Dish Rack,I have only had this item a couple of months and it is already rustingwhere the legs rest on the plasitc tray which is one thing the reviewsaid it did not do so that is why I originally bought it.I was not thrilled to spend the $ 29.95 in the first place.
2,Not for the seasoned cook,"I enjoy watching Giada on the Food Network at was looking forward to purchasing her cookbook. I ordered it immediately and was very dissapointed. I found that the best recipes from her show were not included however, included were recipes for Chicken Parmesan without the breading and Nutella spread on toast. I did not need to purchase a full priced cookbook to learn how to prepare dishes to the likes of these. I did not find this cookbook to be very well thought out and overall I was dissapointed. There are an array of very flattering photos of Giada and a true lack of substance in the recipe department. Download her recipes from Foodnetwork the book is incomplete"
3,Too Few Recipes Too Much Giada,"I very much like Giada De Laurentiis on her Food Network TV show and I have made a number of her recipes from the show and found them easy and excellent. Consequently, I was eager to get her book. But the book has relatively few recipes, few of which seem to be from her shows. My biggest disappointment is that there were so many pictures of her. Sure, some pictures are to be expected but not half the book (or so it seemed.) I would rather have had some more recipes and fewer pictures of Giada."
3,Should have more photos,"This book contains easy and delicous recipes, everything an average person needs in the kitchen.However Giada does not provide photos for her recipes. Photos are essential I believe to understand the concept and get an idea on how to present the food. I love Giada, I watched most of her shows, but she missed an important point for me!!!!"
3,LOVE HER & HER FOOD BUT TOO MANY PICTURES,"I am a big fan of Giada and her show. However, during her shows I noticed the camera is on her most of the time, instead of the dish she is preparing. Now her book seems to be the same way. I enjoy the recipes very much but would like to see more of what we are trying to create, which is excellent Italian food."
1,Disappointed,"Not the recipes I was expecting. I am a very visual person and in a cookbook I find this important. This book does not provide many images. I was not impressed with the recipes, and some seemed far more complex than I would expect for everyday use."
2,Disapointing,"I love Giada, I really do, Love her shows and recipes. The problem is that too many of the recipes in the book can just be found by visiting her show list on the Food Network Site. Too many of the recipes were featured on her show. I hoped to see NEW recipes from Giada, not all the same ones I had already seen. It is nice to have it in book form for the future, but, I just expected more."
5,EXCELLENT,This book is easy to follow and all the recipes I've tried so far have been excellent. I highly recommend this book.
1,Bad recipe book,"too many pictures of GIADA. She must be in love with herself!@!!!!!too few pictures of the recipes.too few recipes.lame pictures on lemons and basil.structure of table of content/index poor.Save your money, GO TO AN Italian restaurant, at least you can get 1 or 2 good entres."
4,Ladies...buy the book and get your hubby to cook,"Giada brings a sexual flair to Italian cooking for sure. Just watch the show and see how she cuts veggies, washes her hands, and samples the food.Recipes won't make you a Michelan rated restaurant chef, but hey ladies, if you want your husbands to cook while you relax...buy this book."
3,"Extreme Narcissism, Plus Many Good Recipes","There are SO MANY PHOTOS of the author in this supposed cookbook it's laughable. And a little scary. And they are all cleavage shots. There are often as many as THREE photos of Giada splashed across just 2 pages {so that you are forced to see three shots of her just to look at one recipe...}. And there are full-page photos of her as well ! I was so sick of looking at Giada's cleavage and her face I ended up tearing the recipes I wanted out of the book, and throwing the ""photo album"" part of it away. I think if you were to just clip all the photos out this book would weigh 60% less if you actually weighed it. Many of the recipes sounded just great and I can't wait to try them though. Too bad Giada's ego basically ruined an otherwise interesting cookbook. You'd have to see it to believe it."
5,Giada Paints A Masterpiece,"I am not a cookbook collector, however I eagerly anticipated Giada's first cookbook after being an avid viewer of her television show and watching her superb special on Italy. Upon viewing the book I purchased it immediately and proceeded to the store to buy some ingredients for Sunday dinner. This is the cookbook that will revive the cook who is getting bored with old receipes. Some dishes in the book are indeed old receipes, but Giada uses fresh ingredients and recreates favorites in a new manner.I think I love the creativity featured here more than anything else. And even those who may live in the most backward areas of the country will be able to find the ingredients used here. Regardless of what type of Italian fare interests you, it will be found inside of the pages of this fabulous book. Congrats Giada on a masterpiece."
5,What a voice!!!!!,I absolutely love this cd! Luis Fonsi has a beautiful voice. It really touches me everytime I listen to it. I listen to it everyday! I also like that he has songs in English as well. I recommend this cd to everyone. The songs are slow & so heart warming. My favorite song is Mi Sueno. I actually like every song on this cd. That is really hard to come across.
3,No Durability,"The blocks are hollow, which is good when they fall, and the glue isn't very durable. As soon as they were exposed to a humid day the blocks started falling apart."
2,Modern rock redux,"You'd think with four songwriters to pick from, at least one of them would have something interesting to contribute. But, in the tradition of modern-rock radio yawns like Dishwalla and The Refreshments, Amiral Twin mostly deals in big generic guitars, arena-ready hooks that sound like Kinko's copies of other arena-ready hooks and trite lyrics that sound deep without really saying anything much at all."
5,This is a must have,If you like the Beatles this band is one you need in your collection. The harmonies are tight. The songs actually say something unlike a lot of pop artist out there. This is what rock and roll should be about it is too bad Mojo Records could not see that.
4,From Melodramatic to Admiral (Twin),"I listened to the album and I think it is great! I am from Tulsa, OK and grew up around these guys as locals (Melodramatic Wallflowers) and they have truly blossomed into an excellent rock band.The new album rocks!"
5,Insightful view of Hitler's most fanatical troops,"This book provides the reader insight into the men, organization and equipment of Hitler's fanatical SS who were undoubtedly not as fanatical as advertized.Plenty of pictures. Informative reading."
3,Not bad for an early book,"This is one of Greg Bear's early work. The reader can already see that Bear is great at developing both an intriguing story and well defined characters. The problem with this book is that it leaves the reader feeling unfinished. Compared to his later works ""Darwins Radio"" and ""Queen of Angels"", this is unfinished work. It is not bad, just not finished. Much of the underlying society study that he has become so familiar for developing is missing, although there are hints of it in this book. This is both enjoyable and an easy read. It is also a great book to start with for Bear. It is certainly not one of his best, but it does show his early start and that is not bad."
4,monitor,"Just great as a TV, but I wonder whether it is as good as a monitor for PC. Anyone has the answer?"
5,Excellent choice for reading,I first read these books when I was in H.S. They inspired me to want to be a better person and devote myself to good works. I know that sounds odd but these are no ordinary books. I recently reread them and found them to be even better than I remembered. These are noble books written by a noble man. Tragically the author died from cancer at a very young age. The background for these books may seem a little dated due to the fall of Communism in Russia but the subject is as pertinent now as it was then and will be hundreds of years from now. Inhumanity and humanity. The cruelty of ideolegies versus the compassion of the individual. These are an excellent choice for any reader from nine to ninety-nine.
4,Night before,"A cute book (literally as it is about 3 1/2 inches by 5 inches), great for a stocking stuffer! The author throws various Seattle bits into the tale--the Needle, Pacific Science Center, Boeing and even the Sonics, Seahawks and Mariners. Know someone moving to Seattle? Here's your gift for them! Are you from Seattle? Give this to your friends and relatives! This would also be a nice souvenier."
2,Nice looking shoe but uncomfortable,Might be a sizing issue. I tried the size 10 and it was big enough that my heel kept sliding out. The 9.5 fits but really hurts around the toes. I now have beautiful looking & expensive shoes that I never wear as a result. :(
4,Very funny; visual humor in the illustrations irresistible,"Very young children or children who are unable to focus on detail won't get much out of this book (hence the four-star rating), but for the rest of us, it's a winner. The dialogue is sometimes straight out of P. G. Wodehouse, and my children laugh themselves nearly sick over it, proving that you don't need to know the cultural background for such dialogue (for example,""Ta-ta, old sausage"") for it to work. The treatment of the felonious Father Christmas is sympathetic and serves as a good counterpoint to the reality of the criminal-justice system in the U.S. My husband and I bought this book for ourselves long before we had children, and we find new bits of humor each time through--as do our sons, presently aged five and six."
4,Benefit centric innovation delivers exponential growth!,"In ""Blueprint to a Billion"", David Thomson does a great job at illustrating what has worked and why it has worked. I appreciate that the qualitative claims are well substantiated by a thorough quantitative analysis. I had the opportunity to work for some Blueprint companies, like Siebel Systems, where I was managing the CRM SBU and the Blueprint provided me with a fascinating framework to look back at what had happened!I particularly agree with the emphasis on innovations that do deliver tangible and ""monetizable"" benefits to customers, as well as the quest to acquire marquee customers. But of course, your company has different potential futures that are shaped by the decisions you're making right now, so get back to work!"
4,An engineer's perspective,"I enjoyed ""Built to Last"" by Collins and Porras, and view ""Blueprint to a Billion"" as providing another great perspective. While it has the feeling of a Powerpoint presentation at times, the material was interesting. I appreciate David's realistic philosophy about what this study represents and what it doesn't represent. I recently travelled to Norway and bought a postcard listing Viking Laws for my team, because it appears that these same laws could apply to the embedded systems development done by my company today: ""Be a good merchant - find out what the market needs"" is one of the many laws that could help my company today. David's book enlivens this law."
5,Delightful!,"I collect music from the 20's, 30's and 40's and this CD is fast becoming one of my favorites. Simply every track on it is superb: bouncy, catchy, tight danceable tunes. The only one I didn't like upon first hearing it was ""Peckin"". I disliked the voices at the outset but I listened to the whole thing and the rest of it, minus the beginning talk, is just as great as all the others. If you love this early bouncy jazz, you simply must get this!!"
1,Psychobabble,"I agree with the reviewer who described this biography as psychobabble. Mozart's music is perfectly formed, with melodies that are hauntingly beautiful. This biography is pompous and tedious. I regret having purchased it."
4,"An in depth, complete biography of one of the great maestros","I can firmly state that I believe that there is no more complete biography of Mozart available. There were some parts of the book that would appeal to those who are well versed in music theory, but were difficult for me to navigate. Although I found it difficult, I feel it is better to be complete in infomation than leaving items out for the sake of readability. One comes away from this biography with a better understanding of this troubled life and the insight to better enjoy his works."
2,"A hard, laborious read","Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable."
1,Does NOT stay cool,"I bought this to replace a tea kettle that does not have a stay cool handle. The description specifically said that the handle stays cool to the touch. Well, the first time I used it I grabbed it with my bare hand (it said it stays cool!) and guess what? it was HOT. I burned my hand. I am returning this item."
5,5 stars for Randy!!!,"A friend of mine took this DVD to my house last week since I bought a new home theater for my living room. He told me that he had a surprise for me.I could not beleive my eyes and ears, Randy Bachman??? with the best of BTO and the Guess Who in one DVD? Way to go, man. This a ""must have"" for any person that loves the good old rock and roll of the 60's and 70's"
4,Very good but overblown,"Overall it is very good, but let's not kid ourselves Randy never was a great singer! Colin is very good, but their harmonies in Four Wheel Drive sure sound flat to me. Though there are amps used this should be considered unplugged."
3,Re-recordings,"This CD looks like a greatest hits collection, but doesn't contain the original hits. These recordings are taken from a Sidewalk label album (misleadingly titled ""Golden Hits of the Paris Sisters"") recorded circa 1967. Aside from the re-recordings of their earlier hits, there are a few new songs here, including some that Priscilla Paris wrote. The CD is a good value for serious fans, but it can't compare to the group's Gregmark hits and their album ""The Paris Sisters Sing Everything Under the Sun."""
4,Sound Quality Okay,"The only song I really wanted off this CD was ""I Love How You Love Me"". The other songs were pretty awful, simply because they weren't my style. :) I'm not so old that I remember ever hearing these songs on the radio, just the one I mentioned.Also, the CD case arrived cracked in 3 places, yet the disc appeared fine and played well."
1,Did not work for me...,"As a sufferer from chapped lips, this did not work for me at all. I gave it a good week...and by the end of that week, my lips were even more chapped! I thought it would be great after reading all the good reviews, but unfortunately wasn't the case for me. I will just stick to my MAC lip conditioner which works about 80% of the time. Meanwhile, I'll be searching for better chapsticks :)"
5,Useful for women with suspected estrogen dominance,Wish I had discovered this product when I was a teenager-it would have saved me from years of suffering from PMS typesymptoms!
4,Fun in a dog suit,"Hard cover with dust jacket. Approximately 5 l/2 X 8 l/2. Unpaged. A somewhat of a retrospective, with a few newer strips included, that primarily reprints the first 1963 annual. Also includes an introduction by Alex Graham's daughter Aaron Graham, a slight biography by some U.K. person Mac and the 1976 ""Cartoonist Profiles"" interview. Several nice photos. I bought mine from a U.K. Amazon Marketplace seller and it arrived promptly and safely. It would be nice if Fred Basset publications cited date of original publication, but, oh well... Recommended purchase, if you do not own the first annual."
5,awesome,"This is a very informative guide, and it is very usefull for decoding hiroglyphs. It also teaches you a lot about the language and its history."
2,Practical Visual Interdev 6,The book refers you to the web site that is not there. And there is no way to download the codes. Plus the examples for charting used the component can no longer be found on the site it refers to. The authors and publisher already knew this from the previous version - Using VID 6. But still chose to mislead the buyers. Proceed with caution!
1,Missing Item,"I ordered the Set thinking it'd be nice to get both products together. Package arrived and only the 8 inch triangle was there. Called Amazon customer service and agent argued with me before finally offering a refund if I returned the 8"" triangle and their expense. Never ordering anything else via Amazon again. This is the 3rd time I've had trouble with items."
4,A must read for managers at all levels,"A well written book that holds your interest with good quotes and interesting stories. Whether you're a new manager or a seasoned veteran, Lift offers keen insight to the style of top managers. If you are a leader or plan to be in the future, this book belongs in your library."
4,Lift,"LIFT is an easy read that weaves the basic building blocks of leadership through both military and corporate life. Full of anecdotes and great qoutes, I think anyone would enjoy this book."
2,Didn't Prepare Me!,I THOUGHT this book was good until I went to take the California RE Exam three days ago in Los Angeles ... The tone and content of this prep book was only about 50% in alignment with the actual test -- I felt cheated and that this book was out of touch and did NOT adequately prepare me for the test.
3,Ca real estate exam,Book is alright-touches on many of the possible questions to the test. There are other good study books out there as well I'm sure.
3,the navy color is very dark,Honestly you can't easily distinguish between the two sides. Both almost look alike in color. The leather is OK but not what I expected.
4,OVERLOOKED,"THIS IS A GREAT CD that has been totally overlooked in 2000. One of the tracks, A Poli & Poli, has one distinct line that sounds like ""They Don't Know About Us"" (Tracey Ullman, Departure Lounge). Highly recommend."
2,Very inadequate experience,"It only work 50% of time, the cleaning quality is not bad, but by the time you set up the perimeter for it's movement, you could just vacuum yourself. The tech support is not very knowledgeable or helpful."
1,Ewww,I bought this based on the other reviews and was disappointed. The ivory is very see-through so the model in the picture must be wearing some kind of liner under this nightgown. The bodice offers no support to anyone with even a little up top. I also did not like where the bodice fell on me: somewhere between the waist and bra band line which is not the most flattering cut. It made me look at least 20 pounds heavier than I am. My husband's face said it all when I tried this one on--not good!! It's going back ASAP.
5,Elegant and soft gown.,I had been searching for just this type of gown for several years in retail stores. ( I think terry pj's are the new age choice for the young and old - but I have always preferred the soft and elegant sleepwear.
2,Material not as good these days,My Shadowline gown is beautiful and fits well. The material is not nearly as good theses days. Quality material used to be a given for a Shadowline product. Disappointed
2,"I Love the Callahan Books, but . . .","[..]I have loved the Callahan books since I first read Time Travelers Strictly Cash, but this was a disappointment. The problem is that although much of it is amusing, it contains aphorisms that could lead to disaster if actually followed. The assertion that children should be allowed to have ""play sex"" is a case in point: how do you define ""children""? I cringe to think of the increase in AIDS and other STDs in teenagers and even subteens--and if you think the latter is stretching it too far, I know a man who is 54 and whose oldest daughter is 43. I don't wish I hadn't ought it, because if I hadn't I'd always wonder what was in it, but there are a few too many things I wish Robinson had left out."
1,"A waste, not of time but of talent","I popped this disc into the player with great anticipation: great talent, great lineage, great history. Unfortunately, the effort is so lackluster that I wonder if it isn't an imposter?The lyrics are juvenile; the music is mediocre. If this is Mr. Leadon's best then a rocking chair and a Marlboro may be a better use of his time."
2,Mirror Bernie Leadon,"I ordered this CD to see what had happened to the ex Eagle, Bernie Leadon. Now I know. I am not a fan of this music. The songs are no at all what I expected and will most likely not listen to it much in the future. My expectations were something from a similar style or content of Eagle type music, but I feel the songs are weak and talent is not to my expectations. Very disappointed. Sorry Bernie."
1,Bad Memories of Duke!,"For an Ellington fan, this DVD is a great disappointment. Both video and audio quality are absymal. The disc is supposed to be recorded in both Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and 2-track stereo, but I have heard better sound on 78 rpms from the 1930s. Here it is distorted and muddy. The video is grainy. Even the performance of this magnificent band sounds uninspired. The only really worthwhile section is the Duke playing extended solo piano in the Mexican Suite, which is rarely heard. Many fine stereo vinyl recordings are available from 1968, when this film was shot, so why is its sound quality so poor? Fans of the Duke -- and the world of jazz in general -- deserve much better."
3,TOO EASY,"THIS YOUNG AUYHOR DID A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THE KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD AND CONNECTING THE DOTS IS KEY. FOR EXAMPLE: CHRISTINE SPENDS ALL THIS TIME WITH ERIK, NIGHTS WEEKENDS ETC. NOW SUDDENLY, ROUL IS UPSET BECAUSE THEY MADE LOVE, SENS HER AWAY TO KEEP THEM APART. a LITTLE OVER THE TOP I:D SAY. ALSO WHY ARE ALL OF HER FRIENDS RICH AND SUDDENLY OPERA MINDED...i DID ENJOY HER FANTASY WORLD THAT PART WAS BELIEVABLE AND ENTERTAINING. READERS WILL ENJOY MOST OF IT AND SHOULD GIVE IT A GO."
4,Great product and quickly received!,"This calculator was received quickly. As a teacher, it is exactly what I was looking for. And, it was cheap!"
3,Hmmm...Copying off of Legally Blonde?,"Legally Blondes was basically a rip-off of Legally Blonde except instead of Elle Woods, there were Annabelle (Annie) and Isabelle (Izzy) from across the pond. Many of the characters are like the ones in Legally Blonde: Sylvia is like Paulette, Chris is like Emmett, Mr. Golden is like the UPS Guy, Tiffany is like a Vivian (kind of), and Warner is like Justin. They also have a thing called the ""flip and wave"" (ehhm, bend and snap anyone?) that they teach Sylvia. The thing is basically all about how blondes shouldn't be underestimated & has a ""trial"" at the end. It was an okay movie, it would've been better if they hadn't copied off of the original."
1,UNWANTED TRASH!,"What a great way to get rid of an un-wanted house guest. Keep a copy of this film close at hand, and when you have had just about all you can take, put this film into your dvd player and hit the play button.If they haven't high-tailed it out your door within 15 minutes, pray for a visit from Freddy."
3,decent film at a decent price,some of the video is kinda cheaply made... most is well thought out. Guy knows what worked for him... decent film at a decent price
4,Pretty good,Decent book for rebuilding small block mopars with emphases on the newer magnum motors. Good pictures but some things aren't covered as well as they could have been.
3,was expecting more...much more,"i know this book is only 3 bucks, but i paid more for shipping than the book (i know, im signing up for prime next time)anyways, i thought this book would have been bigger. its hardly more than a magazine, has 122 pages. most of it reads more like a book than a how-to guideit does have some good info and good photos, just wanted it to be more"
3,The wired / wireless phone system,I purchased this phone because I loved the combination. The base system itself is great. The display works even when you are not on the phone. The caller ID and everything. The wireless handset does not display as the base system. It only shows incoming calls but it serves its purpose.
3,Not automatic,"I haven't had the light long enough to see how long it will last but I was expecting a light that comes on automatically when the power goes off. I had another brand that did, and I assumed they all worked the same. But other than that... so far, so good."
3,"Interesting ideas, confusing writing","Brown talks about a lot of interesting things. THis stuff makes me think about things that I never thought about in this way and perspective before. But most of the time I don't understand a lot of the things he says, so it makes it hard for me to really understand what exactly he is trying to say."
4,Brown Lightnin',"Strking a white guy from Montana living in the purgatory of the outlands of the West, this book understates its own goals - as it should. And overfulfills its promise. It is shewd, literate, thoughful, and filled with bright insights into our common condition. Surprise and delight somwhere on every page. A dead-on counter to the prevailing post-civil rights race consiousness that prevails in the United States. Marred only by occasional obscurity of reference, and ponderous paragraph.In another 500 years, we will all be medium brown, and will have to find something else to fight about."
1,Where's the meat????,"I was excited to get this book after listening to Mr. Rodriquez on NPR. But as too often happens, the book makes most of its points by referring to people, places, literary texts, etc. that are not familiar to a normal person with a college education in something other than literature. This book was obviously written to impress ideas on the elite, whether educationally, politically, or otherwise. If you are willing to trudge through a very lyrical, almost poetic writing style, there are some very good stories and points to be made. But reading this book just wore me out. I think if only the relevent text had been printed, it would have been long enough for an editorial, not a book."
2,Disappointing.,"After reading some very intriguing interviews, I was excited to read ""Brown."" The subject fascinates me. Unfortunately, I got the sense that Rodriguez, brilliant as he may be, has the attention span of a sparrow. He interrupts himself in mid-thought, flitting from one half-expressed idea to another and then falling back on a personal anecdote. Invariably, just as I thought he was about to get into some interesting territory he would fade off, seemingly forgetting his place. Frustrating - I'd love to read a similar book written by someone more coherent."
5,Decimator Pro Rack-G,"This is a tremendous piece of gear that I use in both live settings and for recording. It is a MUSICAL noise gate, that is, it puts a ""gentle fade"" on sustained notes, as opposed to awkwardly choking them like many other gates. Worth the expense. Tom Vitacco (Chicago area guitarists) [...]"
5,A nose for trouble is a classic,"I read this book when I was a boy maybe 30 years or so ago and loved it. I have probably read this book 50 tomes or more in my life, absolutely love it. It is an easy read now but a timeless tale that any boy will love."
4,7/12/99 Review Unfair; a quite useful book,"The only other review at the time of this posting is rather unfair, probably because the author misunderstood the purpose of the book. It is a guide for walking the streets of Paris to look at buildings. It is not a coffee-table book. Hence the relative paucity of illustrations. Hence the use of actual French names for buildings and places. (How else would you find them? The signs are not in English. And the reviewer obviously found translation no problem.) And the maps are certainly adequate for finding your way. They show excellent small-scale detail. Perhaps the only ""fault"" of the book is that it is so compendious and the information so complete that it takes some study to plan your day. But at 446 pgs, it still fits neatly in a handbag or camera pack. The index is very good, and there are 20 blank pages at the back for your personal notes."
2,"Boring, Boring and more of the same","I found this book extremly boring. It meandered from theme to theme almost without reason. I couldn't bring myself to really care about Z the main character at all, or for anyone else for that matter. The only reason I kept reading was to find out if it got any better... it didn't. Perhaps this is just not my type of book, it all seemed as the author was trying to fill out the novel with events that just didn't seem to mean anything. You can certainly tell that he is hoping to follow this novel with 2 or 3 more, which I won't be buying. I really think a much better story could've been written with a less is more approach. Why is it that everything has to be written as a trilogy or more? The trilogy only works if you actually have something meaningful to hold your audience with. Do yourself a favour and buy something else."
4,WOW................,This movie is SOO gory! And a little disturbing. (I.E. Cat scene). The acting was good. It moved a little slow in the begining then sped up and let gallons of blood fly. Entertaining movie. Worth a rent or cheap buy.
4,Eliminator fog machine,We've used it several times and so far it hasn't failed. Only thing is it leaks so make sure you put something underneath the unit.
4,Is the house on fire?,"Nice little (well not so -little- machine), didn't come with any fog fluid- which is a good thing (really, the generic stuff some brands ship to you is AWFUL horrible..), so I bought some Froggy'sthe fog disperses fairly well with an amazing hang-time, I can leave the room and 20 minutes there's still a haze (but I suppose that's the juice not the machine) Either way, after about 2 full blasts, whole basement was full of a thick haze and rather freaked people out who thought the house was on fire...Bought it so that we can set up out laser and dance lighting system in our basement for parties, pretty nice, but the heating element kinda stinks if you're nearby, might want to buy some fog juice scent to fix that. Also while I haven't had the issue with a clogged nozzle, I suggest when finished drain the fog juice and replace it with distilled/bottled water and run the machine. until it sprays steam so as to clean the system."
1,Not as expected,The advertisement made it seem as if the fog machine also had a light function to it as well. Well it does not and now I have to buy a separate lighting system.
2,Style great; typos and small errors kill the effectiveness,"The style of this book is straightforward and very much what you would expect of an excellent teacher. However, it was put together hurriedly and there are literally dozens of small typos and errors in the test questions. Whole sections have been moved from one place to another without modifying the order of sequential material. A real shame!!"
1,Avoid it.,"I didn't like this book at all.Lots of errors, not even close to the amount of material needed, way too disorganized. The authors are terrible book writers. It's just a mess.The authors should be ashamed. What a disaster their boot camp must be.Highly UN-recommended."
3,Just Read the Help file and On-line Books,The book was written well although it continually points the reader the either the help file or the online books. Most of the information/instruction that I got form this book came from the authors pointing me to the help file. If you want a book to tell you what parts of the helpfile and on line books to read for the test then get this book. Otherwise DON'T GET THIS BOOK
3,Now I know what a boot camp is like!,"This book is very hard to be rated. It does discuss and encourage the reader to explore a lot of useful details in VB. among all the VB books I have read, for example, this one is the best in explaining and showing the scoping rules. also the exercises after each chapter are pretty good. However, this book's quality is poor. When I was reading the book, thank goodness I already knew VB, otherwise, I would pull off all my hair in order to make some sense out of the book. A lot of information was wrong, a lot of pictures were misplaced and some exercises left unanswered. Maybe that is the whole idea of ""bootcamp."" After all, this book would be an excellent resource for experienced VB programmers, however, it would be a nightmare for those who try to learn VB from this book."
5,Baseball-National Pastime,"I bought this for a elderly gentleman who loves baseball. I know he will love this when he gets it at Christmas! It came quickly and in pretty good shape too. There was a slight tear on the book jacket, but a piece of tape will take care of that! All in all, I am satisfied."
2,Disappointed,"This book seems more like a collection of recipes from those grocery store checkout lane cookbooks but without the the creativity - or any pictures at all. While the book does try to focus on low-fat, there doesn't seem to be much use of fresh ingredients, instead relying on canned or pantry items. This book would better serve someone who hates to cook but would rather cook at home than eat out or someone who is a beginning cook. I am not a gourmet, but was looking for something a little more creative with the use of fresher ingredients. I was dissappointed with this book."
1,Healthy Cooking for Singles & doubles,The title is misleading. I found the receipes not to be low fat and high in calories. I was disapointed in this book. I returned it as soon as I got it.
2,Have your dictionaries at your side while reading this book!,"Being a student of domestic and international terrorism, I have read numerous books and periodicals on the subject. Not until I bought ""Inside Terrorism"" did I find the need to have a dictionary nearby so I could follow the book. I think Mr. Hoffman would do all readers a favor if he wrote in plain English, as opposed to using ""Academician English."" Using high fallutin' words to say something that can be said in simpler terms takes away from the enjoyment of what otherwise would be a good book.Definitely not a book for your average terrorism student."
1,BE CAREFUL!,"When I recieved this product, I cleaned it. The paint came off on the washcloth I was using to clean the product! BE CAREFUL!"
2,Disappointment,the shoe was nice but it was the wrong size so I returned it about a month ago and still have not recieved the product.
3,Interesting,An interesting take on mothers and their daughters. Alot of it was common sense knowledge in my opinion. Worth a quick read.
4,Breakthrough for Exercise Induced Asthma Sufferer,"My seventeen year old basketball player/severe exercise induced asthma sufferer had just about given up. After pulmonary function tests, puffers, etc., I found this book.........Read it and within two days, she was feeling the relief. The book is not perfect...but the message is one every person with breathing difficulties should see and try. I'm grateful.....No more meds."
1,In total agreement with asthmatics review,"The Buteyko method is a superb therapy for asthma. Teresa Hales book touches on it but does not contain it. There are many books available which are worthy of reading especially if you have asthma, fatigue and other complaints. For example- do a search for Asthma Free naturally, Every Breath you take, The Buteyko Manual or a very simple read with all exercises called Close Your Mouth.Good luck and healthy breathing"
2,"Very good for a simple flash, very bad for a flashpoint","I use a lightsand for about a year with a simple flash and an umbrella, and works very good.I bought another one for a Flashpoint Model II 320A Monolight 150 Watt Second Strobe.But the second time I used the lightstand with the Flashpoint and the umbrella, the lightstand broked down.Fortunately the Flashpoint was protected by the umbrella.Do not use with a Flashpoint or something heavy!"
2,De-contented Club,"If I'd been able to turn the locking mechanism in a store, I would never have purchased this lock. The lock is really flimsy and cheap feeling, especially compared to the heavy duty lock on The Club (red cover). This lock is a visual deterrent, but I don't hold out much hope of it stopping a determined thief. Next time I'm buying The Club. One other annoying thing about this lock, you can't put it on without the key like a more expensive club, and the key is really hard to turn and feels like it is going to break when you turn it."
4,A 4th Grade Student Review,"Little Lefty is all about a kid who likes baseball.His best freind Larry and him went to the pool and they were going on the high dive. So Larry goes first. Then Little Lefty went and when he hit the water,he was hurt his leg. Then he could not swim back to the surface so Larry dove in the water and helped him out of the water. Then Little Lefty gets on a team and Larry's dad bought Little Lefty a baesball glove and Larry one too. Little Lefty asked his coach if Larry could practice with them and the coach says ""yes"". I thought that was really nice of Larry's dad to give Little Lefty a glove and Little Lefty was really happy that Larry's dad gave him a glove.~Dr.Pepper"
5,One Hit Wonderland Music,"I have seen many sites with "" I Specialize In Love "" selling and people asking the question "" Where is Sharon Brown and What Happened To Her ? ""Well my good peopleVisit http://www.sharonispecializeinlovebrown.com for all information on "" Recording Artist Sharon Brown ""The web site is still under construction and it looks wonderful .

3,decent product,"A pretty good product over all. The plastic screen makes the ""turntable"" on my ipod hard to use. The case can convert to stand which is pretty good."
1,dissatisfied customer,"i'm not happy with my purchase. installed the product exactly as the installation instructions specify, and it doesn't work. i've contacted the manufacturer and i'm informing you of the problem i am experiencing. i couldn't find a link that would allow me to begin a dialogue on how to resolve this issue, so i'm trying this approach. i hope it works and i can get this situation resolved. if i can't get this rectified, i won't use Amazon again."
4,Fan thermostat,"This control is easy to install and adjustable. Alot of cars fry their motors because the owners are not aware of their fans not working. If your fan is not working and it checks out electrically good and it is too hard to diagnose why it isn't working, then install this control and ,or add, a new Hayden fan if the fan is bad. The instructions are easy to follow and you can call Hayden for help if need be."
5,Love Tolkien,"The book was in great shape, and came on time.I purchased it for my son, who was delighted.He was reading it happily!"
2,Small,The book is much smaller than I anticipated. Sorry to have purchased it. Very sad. Why so many words required?
2,September Day novel,"I feel like I was stung by this book. It is a fictional book, and the presentation made it look like it was a presentation of stories that actually happened around and on September 11. The writing is very simplistic, and the storylines weren't really compelling. It's definitely slanted to the Right's perspective regarding the events. I could see this book being assigned at a junior high or high school level as a means to jump start a discussion on how September 11 affected us then and now. Overall, it was a disappointment."
3,A True Disappointment,"This book was an utter disappointment for me. Don't buy it, buy ""Using C++"" by McGregor. It's the exact same book, only ""Using C++"" is a bit smaller.I checked this book out from my local library, and was fairly irritated at this outrage. The only thing McGregor had changed in the book is the dedication(s). Everything else is exactly the same. Even the tables of contents and the indexes. They even have the same number of pages.I checked this book out because McGregor's ""Using C++"" was a bit unclear and hard to follow for a beginning C++ programmer such as myself. I was hoping he had revised some of his teaching methodologies, but he didn't.But, this book still has pretty good content for the intermediate programmer, but buy ""Using C++"" instead. It takes less shelf space."
2,Not so hot!,"Ok, this man is a very talented writer. The way he writes however is bit wordy with not enough examples. Concepts in my mind were flying over my head because I never saw them being used in an example. For the people like me, (needing examples) I wouldn't recommend getting this book. For the people that can understand everything by just reading, this is the book for you. This man's style of writing is in a way selfish. However, I don't believe he wrote it in that manner. Good authors write for every type of mind set; wether is be visual, verbal, or any other method that people learn from easier."
1,"Reprint of earlier text, ""Using C++""","This text was nothing more than a rehash of his earlier text, Using C++. How an 'author' (I use the term lightly) can take the same material, place a different title on it, and resell it is beyond me. Thank goodness I was able to return it for a refund. If you already own Using C++, save your money on this one. Based on this experience, I won't be purchasing future texts by Rob."
4,VERY entertaining,"This book is a lot of fun to read, and the English translation, while I can't vouch for faithfulness to the original, is very good. If anything, a translation enhances the sense of seeing the story through a telescopic lens, as we are, as is the narrator himself. His musings on how television is the enemy of thought are a delight, while at the same time his obsession with television never ends. Many other parts are laugh out loud funny. Less than 200 pages, not too much heavy lifting. Of course we never hear about that Titian paper, whether it's completed, but that's ok."
4,Second in a two-volume fantasy series; dense but worthwhile,"Second in the fantasy series begun in ""The Mirror of Her Dreams"", Stephen Donaldson continues his story of adventure and intrigue in a world on the other side of a mirror. Thematic questions of worth and personal identity are undertaken in the story of Terisa Morgan, a beautiful but ""empty"" young woman who is catapulted into a new existence of danger and romance in the land of Mordant, a world where mirrors are for magic, not vanity.Though the style of Donaldson's writing is dense and detailed, the tale moves along at a satisfying clip. The ""Mordant"" series is less angst-ridden than the better-known ""Thomas Covenant"" books....to me, that's a definate advantage"
5,Donaldsons genius,"When I first started reading the Mordants Need series I went crazy, I was so excited because I found a book that was romantic, exciting, and makes you believe that anyting is possible. Donalson is very good at adding detail to his books. This book is about the struggle to realize who you are and how important you really are. Terisa and Geraden finally realize that they are ment to be together.(finally! It drove me crazy!) If you are looking for a book that is exciting, romantic, and proves that anyting is posseible this book, and the series are the books for you."
3,Ysatis review,"The scent is not what I had remembered, so I don't know quite what I will do with such a large amount of this perfume!"
5,Mrs. Veloman's favorite fragrance (and she's not old!),"(Mrs. Veloman writes this review): Someone has labeled this as a scent for ""mature women,"" but we disagree - I've loved it since discovering the joys of French perfume. If you like oriental, warm, floral scents but want something more individual than the plethora of fruity florals so common right now, this is a scent that is unique yet not overpowering. A quality perfume smells different on different people, and doesn't precede you into the room. My husband selected this as a gift a number of years ago, and I always come back to it after trying other scents - it is truly a favorite of ours with many happy memories."
2,Only Hubbie likes it,"I thought I was buying the General Tso's sauce but accidentally ordered this orange sauce. My kids and I *love* Chinese food, but we don't like this sauce at all. The ginger is overpowering.My husband, on the other hand, doesn't like Chinese food but likes this sauce.Thanks to the other person who suggested mixing it with a bbq mix -- at least we'll have something to do w/ the other bottles."
4,A reconsideration of Confederate and Union Leadership,"Thomas Buell, in his ""The Warrior Generals"" attacks some of the ""marble men"" of the Civil War, notably Lee and to a lesser extent, Grant. Of the six generals compared and contrasted by Buell, Lee comes out worse by far. While some pro-Lee partisans would be shocked and possibly offended by Buell's very blunt criticisms of Lee's generalship, he does raise some very interesting points. George Thomas is Buell's favorite, and he comes out best from this book. In particular Thomas's use of improved weapons, supply, communications and advanced tactics endear him to Buell. I found myself surprised by the fact that Thomas has been remandered to footnote status with all of these advances. Buell's book will either generate large amounts of praise or venom from readers. Either way it will force most Civil War buffs to reconsider their opinions about the accepted ratings of Union and Confederate generals."
4,"Biased and not evenly written, too much on Lee and Grant","Great book which analyzes six of the top generals in the civil war. Warrior Generals gives you a glimpse into their heads before, during and after battles. Excellent companion to Foote and McPherson, must read for American Civil War buffs."
2,Facts stretched to support thesis,"While the book proffers a stunning analysis of George Thomas and the strength of his leadership,the treatment of Lee and, to a lesser extent, Grant is rooted more in an effort to be provocative rather than to illuminate. To repeatedly condemn Lee's decision-making is to ignore the verdict of military leaders and historians who have examined his record for over 150 years."
4,Amazing Story from an Amazing Time,"This is not just a story about the famous B-17, but also a tale of the man who flew her and his crew. It is a wonderful story that reveals much of the man his life. The narrative is well balanced between great achievement and humbleness, and provides plently of action along with some of that normal life that the rest of us mortals must live. I felt moved by the segment towards the end where the aircraft is finally given a proper display in Memphis, which happens to be where the narrative began at the beginning of the story. Highly recommended."
4,Very good product,"Have used this system for over 3 yrs now, origanally with a shepard and a doberman now with 2 dobermans. Nun of my dogs have even thought about running through it.Batterys on collars last for weeks if your not using remote funtion and shut it off. Broken wire alarm is an awesome feature as I've broken the wire twice while doing landscaping and wouldn't have known it except for alarm.Range on remote could be a bit longer, inly reason for 4 stars but it works for us while camping. The optional zone device is great to keep dogs away from picnic tables.Would recommend upgrading to heavier gauge wire."
1,BEWARE! Collar will not last and replacements are $105,"Innotek at one time made a good collar that was durable and battery lasted about 3 years. They now provide a cheap rubber/plastic collar with cheap batteries that will last slightly over a year requiring a collar replacement ($105 on Amazon) as the batteries are not replaceable. In other words, Innotek gets 5 stars for mastering gouge-ology. See the terrible reviews of the replacement collar, ""Innotek UltraSmart Extra Collar Receiver for IUC-4100, IUC-4200, and IUC-5200 Systems"" before you buy this system. You will spend Over $200 in about 2 years. Also I verified that the Remington collar is not compatible with the IUC-522 system. You apparently are stuck buying these cheap but expensive collars. Buy a different system with collars that have replaceable batteries and are durable."
4,A very good Geen Tea!,This is a reasonably priced smooth tasting Green Tea. I drink Green Tea every morning. This is my new favorite. Being organic is a big plus to me. It is smooth tasting and refreshing. It brews to a beautiful golden color!A premium Tea at a reasonable price!
1,Very insufficient....,"I am an engineering student and currently in differential equations. I bought this solutions manual to accompany the text book (which I also strongly don't recommend) and wish I had returned it to the bookstore in time. Unforntuately, I am stuck with it now. This solutions manual does not explain anything thoroughly. Any questions with problems that I have, or anyone else in my class for that matter, are almost always skipped over as if the answer to the question is blatantly obvious. You'll probably have much better luck researching the answers to your questions on the internet or just asking your professor to explain it, because this solutions manual is next to no help at all."
2,Student Solutions Manual,This manual skips steps that are crucial to understanding the fundamental process of solving the problems. Very much like the examples in the book. The manual also skips the more difficult problems posed in the text. Better off not buying this manual at all. In fact buy a different elementary differential equations book. Even if this text is required for some college course a secondary textbook can be very helpful.
4,Beautiful!,"We used this book for an art history course at Yale University, on art, architecture, and design from 1890 to 1940. The book is great! Usually I find the survey sort of book - covering something so wide and expansive as MODERNISM - to get bogged down in cliches or neat little epigrams for quick consumption, but there's no cursory cute treatment here. Weston covers a lot - he's great on explaining theories and movements of design etc but also gives appropriate history, politics, and culture. And that's good, because I like to know what Ezra Pound is thinking about modernism, as it happens. It takes you through time and space nicely - painting, architecture, advertisement, furniture, etc - and you don't feel as if you missed out on anything. Plus the illustrations/photographs are beautiful - I spent so much time just in love with the book for that. Not only is it helpful, but the writing is clear and intelligent, sometimes funny, and irreverent if necesssary."
4,"Good, but not complete","This is a good book, but I wish it would have focused on some of the dangers and pitfalls more.What I mean is, it tells a lot about what is, but not much about what should be or what ought to be.A mother is someone who protects her children and guards their hearts and minds. If this book did more of that I think it would have significantly enhanced the book."
3,But the toy for the look - not the sounds,My little daughter loves horses. When I saw this item on Amazon's features I bought it. It is a fun toy that two months later she still plays with. My only complaint is that the feet stopped making sounds after the first day of use. I changed the batteries (which are round photo-type batteries) but it did not help. It looks to me as though the feet can't take the beating of a four year old. Other than that it is a good product.
2,Not What I Expected,"The lack of stars does not indicate a poor quality of writer, but simply a more one-sided look at faith than I was expecting. The focus was on Buddhism. I was hoping for a more inclusive study."
3,it's Kitchen Aid,Kitchen Aid again. You will not be disappointed. 4 yearsNot to much stuff but it's important to know if you are new to Kitchen Aid.
4,It has left an impression on me for a decade and more,"I recently stumbled across Damiano's Lute and it all came flooding back...being taken to another world from that of my teenage years...so beautifully written. I was immersed completely and wonderfully. Now I will revisit MacAvoy and read anew. Theres just one thing knawing at me - I am not sure where I read about transformations into a tree, eagle and other life-forms..I read other, similar books in the 80's, including The Prince of Hed whose author I can't quite recall??"
2,Ditto Kansas City ( Review Below),"This is the fourth book I've read in the past couple of weeks that tells me to just go out and buy properties for 30% off, get the seller to finance it for nothing down, and then flip it for a great profit. What world are these authors living in? More to the point--how can so many gullible readers buy this stuff? Even worse, Shemin spends a chapter trying to sell you a prepaid legal service with which he's involved.I agree with Kansas City. For meat and potatoes and techniques that make sense see M&E's Investing In Real Estate. Shemin has destroyed his credibility with me with this entry into the Carleton Sheets school of nonsense. I expected better."
2,Little information except how readers can give author more $,"The author structures most chapters around vague generalities. Each chapter contains several pitches to get readers to subscribe to the authors pay site for the ""real"" information. Secondly the author repeats himself so many times if you cut the book in half and gave each half to a friend neither friend would miss anything.The book is clearly a get rich scheme for the author akin to stuffing envelopes. The two stars it does get are for being semi motivational even though it lacks content."
3,"Nice when it works, and the support?","It worked well while it lasted.Died on me suddenly, shortly after the 1st year of warranty.The extended warranty for 3 years was purchased with the laptop, however, Lenovo claims that the extended warranty does not apply to batteries!Nor will they test my computer to see if the adapter or computer was at fault.After many disappointments (other than this one) with Lenovo's service and products, I say no more.-ex IBM thinkpad fan boy, past owner of 8 thinkpads"
2,What Happened to the Projects?,"This book has a beautiful gallery and wonderful pictures, but there are only like 3 projects in the whole book. I can see how a very early beginner like someone who just decided to try this would like it but for more experienced flower makers you might find this book dry. I waited for weeks to get a copy of this book and found myself a bit dissapointed when I finally got it. I just expected more projects."
2,"""Culture for Dummies""","I am a professor of cross-cultural communication and have used this book for two semesters. The reason why I use it is because it has nice pictures, very simple English and graphs to help explain the issues of culture and I teach in English to ESL students. I give it to them as a ""break"" from the other heavier readings that we cover. The very sad part about this book is that when one knows the field, it is difficult to read someone talking about ideas that come from others and to not cite anyone, not anyone. Peterson does not even include a bibliography. To me, this is a serious lack of respect to those that have come before him in the field."
1,BORING!!,"I thought this would be a good interview when I got it, but it's just the same old stuff! Don't waste your money on it!"
5,This works as expected,"For those that need to turn their coaxial cable 90 for any installation, but especially for wall-mounted flat-panel TV's, this works perfectly! The price is great too."
2,Ditto for hyslopc comments,"Hyslopc said ""This adapter comes in two steel parts, which are simply pressed into each other at a 90 degree angle with a little bit of pressure. If you pull the two parts apart (will happen naturally if any tension is applied at either end), then the two parts will separate. That's what happened to me within 60 seconds of plugging this adapter in. The part that fell off consists itself of three parts, which are quite tricky to get back in again - it took me several minutes to work out how to put it back together again. Overall, not impressed at all by this adapter. I expected one single piece of steel, not two pieces flimsily held together. If this thing falls apart again, I will probably buy another adapter to replace it, but for now I'm hoping it won't.""I had exactly the same experience and result so hyslopc saved me brain strain in composing an original review."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed. I never saw anything about ""shelf wear and tear"" so the rips and pencil marks on the cover changed the status of this item from ""new"" to ""ungiftable"" in my eyes."
1,DON'T BOTHER BUYING GARBAGE,"Really unbelievable... The first two problems have the WRONG answers.1. ""3"" megohm is not equal to ""2"" M Ohm. Besides, there's an ""a"" after the ""g"" in megaohm. Geez, two typos in the first question.2. .000000001 F = 1.0 nanofarad, not picofarad as the writer claims. How can anyone trust his answers on the difficult questions when he gets the easy ones wrong?If the problem is with typos then get a proofreader before it gets to the printer. Electrical engineering is a difficult subject as it stands. Circulating books like this makes it still harder to master the subject!"
3,"Cheap, but not that comfortable as what I thought!","I bought this to have a nice sleep during my flight. It, however, is not as comfortable as what I thought, but it's really cheap. Therefore, only just for a short distance flight will I recommend it."
3,"Not bad, not great","This is a decent, compact travel pillow. The two chambers (one for the main body of the pillow and one for the pillow on top of the pillow) is a good concept, but I found that leaving the top chamber deflated is more comfortable as it doesn't push my head forward like it does when it's inflated. I read another review that says the chamber is supposed to go against the headrest, but it didn't do much for me either way.It does what it's supposed to do and does it well, but I do have one complaint: the flap that runs along the inside of the collar. It's a good inch or so of loose material that feels sharp (and distracting) against my neck. I thought about cutting it off or trimming it back, but that'd make the problem worse, I think. Maybe I can try holding a lighter against it to round off the edge?Irritating flap notwithstanding, it's a solid 3-star product."
2,Sublime and Ridiculous,"I thought this novel was very uneven. The sections which revolved around Elizabeth Woodville, Edward IV, their son and Bishop John Alcock were written with a depth of character and insight rarely found in historical fiction.But the Petronela story, while at first quite interesting, with its insights into the role of Medieval women, eventually became a little absurd. I don't want to give any spoilers, but the name given to her son was just silly, and far from subtle.It's frustrating to read such an uneven novel"
1,You have got to be kidding me?,A friend of mine has this CD. He and all of my other friends talk about it all the time. He let me listen to it. I was disgusted but I was ammused that a bunch of guys found this hysterical. It was rediculously stupied and every time this CD enters my home I make sure it is not played. If you are a guy who likes disgusting humor this is for you! It isn't for everyone by any means!
5,Great Book!,"My son is in college, majoring in film/animation and asked for this book for Christmas. He said it's really informative and an all-around great book. Very helpful and very relevant to what he's doing. Based on his glowing review, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is starting out in this field."
5,Keeps you up all night!,"As a fan of Georges Simenon, I like a book that can take me to a different place and that is filled with the human stories rather than just being constant action. J. Carson Black has done this beautifully. Both with the setting (the author's website has pictures of the locations mentioned in the book so you can get an idea of what everything looks like) and the characters. ""Darkness"" starts out with a murder in small-town Arizona and all the complications, social intricacies, and subtexts of a case being handled by both state and local forces. Others here have mentioned the gripping plot, but the book is also rich in human social interaction and memories, and runs the emotional gamut from guilt, denial, fear, and evil to love, courage, and sacrifice. I'm looking forward to Black's next book in what promises to be a great series!"
3,Not Sure I'd Call This A 'Thriller',"Don't get me wrong; this was by no means a terrible read. But, I don't know if I'd call it a 'thriller'. Doesn't a thriller imply that it keeps you on the edge of your seat? Well, this didn't. I found that I really had to push myself to finish reading this book. Not for lack of a good storyline but more because the book did not feel as fast paced as a thriller ought to."
3,slow to get going,I found this book didn't really pick up until the middle or so. It was hard to stay interested in the first half.
1,Just doesn't work,"I was disappointed with this product, it's simply doesn't work. Just buy a good perfume like black orchid by Tom ford instead."
4,great!,"Mind you this is a UNISEX pheromones, it's for everyone, and even better it smells a little different on each person. My friend at work brought some in for me to try and my boyfriend came in on my lunch break and the first thing he said was "" you smell great!"" and during my only half an hour lunch break it was weird, he was being very close and touchy feely. So I had to go out and buy a bottle RIGHT AWAY, because he said later that it smelt so good on me, so we'll have to see what happens :)( and, it does smell great!)"
3,i dont think it was all that,i chosed this rating because i was expecting something that when you smelled the aroma you would be like DAMN that smells soo good
1,"nothing, naughta, zip","I dont notice nothing when I wear this. I am very disappointed in this product. I was not expecting magic, but I was expecting maybe a few heads to turn....."
3,It's ok,"Smells like watermelons on me. The scent is not overpowering at all. I don't even smell it after I've had it on a while, but that could be because I'm used to it. I don't have a sudden surge of men asking for my number or falling all over me. I can't tell if it has the desired pheromone effect."
4,For the newcomer,"It's a tough decision for a newcomer to a musician's oeuvre to decide where to start. It's difficult to start at the beginning--hunting down the musician's first work and then collecting or listening in chronologial order. That's time consuming, and all most want to do is add an item to the shopping cart, click, and wait for the amazon shipment in the mail. This is a good overview of Alexis Korner's great body of work. Here you'll find the brilliant and playful tunes that are all available elsewhere. Some of ask, why couldn't you finally release ""Just Easy,"" a great Germany only release? There are two tracks from that fine recording here, and it just gives me hope that one day that fine recording will finally be given it's place in digital history."
4,"fine, if you need it","it's a perfectly well written and usable book- if you need it. It's simply a recapitulation of what's writtten in the book. No extra answers to exercises, little additional extrapolation of answers to exercises which are already present in the text. In short, if you want the material explained to you one more time, in a slightly more summarized manner, get the book. If you're looking for a shortcut or something not found in the text, don't."
4,Not as good as Styx,"Good book. I bought it right after reading Styx. I was very interesting, but I prefer the older time period of the first book. This book, however, is very well written, and I will be reading more by this owner."
5,Loved this book ... look forward to reading .the series,"Jonathon King creates a compelling character in Max Freeman - a former Philly street cop who left it all behind after a tragic street shooting that leaves a twelve year old dead. Max relocates to Southern Florida where he lives off the grid. His past seems to intrude when he finds the body of a missing child. When Max lands on the suspect list he gets pulled into the police work. King's interesting characters include Freeman's lawyer - a rags to riches black man with a stutter. The story races along in a ""I can't put this down"" fashion. Looking forward to the second in the series..."
3,Not up to the hype,"I looked forward to this read, as it was Amazon recommended based on my reading habits. King tries, but the plotting is complicated, there are too many charracters, few of the characters are realistic. In short, this book was a dissappointment. I didn't think much of Max Freeman."
3,A good read.,"The character of Max is interesting, but unrelentingly depressed and not as fleshed out as I'd have liked. However, King does a wonderful job describing the Everglades and creating a sense of suspense. I would possibly read more of this series. This was a good read, perfect for an airplane or a Sunday afternoon."
3,"More of the Same, but Okay.","What can I say? After renting Deadlands: The Rising I certainly had to give Deadlands 2 Trapped a try.More of the same, shot on video, but a decent bit of entertainment without being absurd.As with the original, for a $1.99 rental it was good entertainment."
2,How traitors become heroes,"Robert E. Lee was a traitor to the United States. He passed up a chance to command the US army to fight for ""Virginia."" False opinions have reached such a crescendo that we are now told that Lee was not a racist, that he loved the Union, that he disliked slavery, that he was one of the great commanders, etc. Not only was Lee a traitor, but he lost the War, remember Gettyburg? Let's not get carried away with hero worship. Grant and Lincoln are the heroes, along with about 300,000 Northern soldiers who the ""great man"" killed in his lost war."
4,Lotion,I Love my lotion. A must have for dry winter weather. I strongly recommend this item to anyone with dry skin. Smells great too. Fair price for the size of the bottle too. :-).
2,Falls Flat,"Being a great Barry Bonds fan, I wanted to like this book. I truly did. But its flaws were too glaring; it came across as one of those ?strike while the iron is hot? books. Such books rarely offer anything of lasting quality.Author Steve Travers tries to offer readers an insightful look into Barry Bonds The Man. While the attempt is admirable, I couldn?t help but come away with the impression that the attempt failed. I came away knowing little to nothing new about what makes Barry Bonds tick. And isn?t that why Bonds fans would be drawn to this?A good portion of the book is fleshed out with pulpish sports writing. It?s passable, but too often lacks passion. Some passages scream ?written too quickly!? Where was the editor? (...)Bonds fans should remain patient; a definitive book on this superstar is inevitable. This ain?t it."
5,"Very helpful, easy to understand","Susan's book was very well laid out from chapter to chapter to allow for a natural progression with which to understand human behavior and how to deal with difficult situations. Easy to read, clear to understand with simple guides to put into practice during a very difficult time. It actually changed my perspective on relationships beyond just working on my own mother's undesirable behavior. I feel like a better person as a result."
4,toxic in-laws,"Good book. If you have problems with your in-laws it will give some insight into why they behave so badly and some pointers on how to over come the hurdles. Now I'll never say ""I didn't marry your parents, I married you!"" again. I'm going to hand a copy of ""Toxic Parents"" (another book by Susan Forward) to my husband."
3,Umm...where are the Hurting tracks?,"I saw TFF in concert in February 1990 (Patriot Center in Fairfax, VA), and it remains the best concert I've ever been to....even to this day. I have the VHS copy of ""Going to California,"" which is quite different from this DVD. First off, where are the tracks from ""The Hurting?"" Mad World and Change were two highlights from this show. And the songs are out of order on this DVD. Still, I can't complain too much - someone took the time to put most of the concert on DVD. But as long as I have a VCR, my VHS copy will remain a treasure in my collection. Come on, Rhino or Mercury--get the FULL concert out there. There IS a demand for this music. Not everyone is ga-ga for Lady Gaga."
1,Unacceptable,Donnie Darko is one of the greatest movies of our time. S.Darko should have never been made.
5,GORGEOUS!!,"first of all received this so quickly....and WoW!! it is so beautiful. I am so in awe with the detail and workmanship on this bracelet, I cannot stop stealing glances at it on my wrist. Just an FYI the turquoise stone is a ""highly polished"" smooth stone, and not your usual raw earthy turqoise stone."
1,terrible,"First of all the Futon I i received never came with instructions or tools to put it together. Secondly, there were wood parts that were damaged starting to split. I would not recommend the product to the dog they have sitting on that nice fluffy mattress that does not come with the chair my the way. Customers beware......"
5,Workable Information,"Having read this book, I feel that I have the tools needed to get to where I'm going - health."
4,Great writing by Deville,"Nancy Deville's clear, simple, lively prose brings Hanley's voice to the forefront and keeps things moving along in this must-read for anybody interested in new ways to improve long-term health."
4,Solid effort -- I intend to go back for more from Seigel,"This was the first book from Seigel that I have read. It was an airport purchase that, with a long flight from Europe and a connecting flight to my final destination, I had essentially finished before arriving home. While perhaps lacking the benefit of the background from Seigel's previous works with the same characters, I nonetheless was able to really enjoy the story. There were numerous characters to keep track of, creating both a positive (multiple story lines and strong interplay between the characters) and a negative (at times, the story seemed to get bogged down in unnecessary complexity). I did not find this to be a fabulous story, but it certainly was entertaining enough be keep me from switching over to the in-flight movies and was more than sufficient to prompt me to go back for more of Seigel's work in the future."
3,I have a Question,Does anyone know if the spices contained in the kit have MSG (monosodium glutamate) or not? I want to purchase the kit; but I need to know this first. Thanks to anyone who can help.
5,Wellness Tummy Mint good for what ails you,"The Celestial Seasoning Wellness Tummy Mint is an excellent aid when an upset stomach or nausea occurs. My family will usually add a couple of dried ginger chips to the tea to boost the effects, but the tea alone is a quick and dependable help."
2,Only worked for a month,Bought this to replace a 300 watt power supply on an older computer. Very easy to install and had plenty of power cords. It ran great and was very quiet for around 45 days then it just quit. Don't know if I got a bad one or if the quality on this product is lacking. I ordered a new one and spent a little more money hoping to get one that will last.
1,...,".... The writing is awful and the story is inane. I cringed from the very beginning, and only continued reading because I thought it had to get better. It doesn't."
1,"Good book, worthless electronic edition","This is an excellent and enjoyable work of history, but this electronic edition just seems to be an unedited copy from Project Gutenberg. Amazon didn't even fix Gutenberg's annoying extra line-breaks between paragraphs, much less provide a hyperlinked table of contents, or link the footnotes. There's no reason to pay money for a copy of a free document."
3,Bijan's Nude,"Bijan's nude isn't the best cologne out there but for the price it isn't quite bad. I would describe this as a fresh out of the shower type of scent. I get a smooth yet strong,soapy kind of smell from this. It reminds me of Le male when it dries down. So for the price I would say why not buy this. I will probably be wearing this during the day on weekends when I go to the gym. I would not wear this for any special occasion though."
1,Bait and switch,I am disappointed in the album. I expected mainly HM instrumentals and received too many vocals. The description of the album should have explained that it was primarily vocals. I cannot recommend this album to Mancini instrumentals appreciators.
3,OK,"I have gout so I like to try and take(Pills), eat, or drink cherries. When I can find black cherries to eat my joints always seem to feel better. Especially since I have a physical job, and requires standing for long periods of time. I tried capsules hoping it would be the same effect. However the capsules didn't really seem to do anything. Still can never go wrong taking cherry anything, and NOW is a company I trust."
2,Don't trust the drop downs,"There was nothing wrong with this mirror, I'm sure it would fit earlier models of the Jeep Cherokee, but the drop down menu said it would fit my 2001. Amazon was good about the return and refund but thier fitment menu is wrong. I called the manufacturer and they said it only fit uo to 97 models. Please fix your drop down fitment chart!"
2,Hugely disappointed,"Having listened to the tracks previewed on this site and reading the glowing reviews I was really looking forward to getting this CD. Alas when I got it I found out the the bonus tracks are just soundbites and for $, I think this CD is well over priced. Don't get me wrong, some of the songs are excellent, especially Sculpture Garden, but it's certainly been badly represented on this site."
2,"Uncomfortable, low quality","This product looks like its picture and arrived quickly, but the cushion is thin with a flimsy fabric cover, making it an uncomfortable seat. I bought it for our kids' use in our den, but I definitely would not recommend it for adults because of the comfort factor."
3,not very comfortable,"I have the futon in my dorm and it is perfect for what I bought it for, very cute and good size. It is not very comfortable for a bed though; the cousins could be more comfortable and hold shape better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered it on November 30th 2011 and it's January 4th 2012 and it's still not here!! Between CEVA, Gulf Coast Atlantic, and Amazon it was a nightmare! I'm expecting it today!"
5,"A keeper, one you pass down to generations to come","I saw this at the theater and today I am buying my own copy. This was an incredible experience for me...the beautiful Texas country shots, the artistic direction and the amazing depth of the story is so incredible. It is one of those stories that begs to be shared. I will be passing this down to the next generation and beyond as a living example of what LOVE can do when put into action. I am so thankful that someone took the time to document this real life drama.Karen Cook"
3,decaf mandarin tea,"The tea is very good, however quite a few of the tea bags had tears in them and therefore the tea grains ended up in my cup, which was not pleasant."
1,poor research and bias,The opening chapters flash through Chilean history in a badly written and poorly researched haze. Later the author gives a one-sided view of the Allende and Pinochet years. Anybody who apologises for a leader who orders the murder of 3000 of their own citizens should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Every Man a Dunce,"I must be missing something. I bought this book based on the review given it by anothe reviewer. I found this book to be sophomoric. Listen to some of this tripe: ""Fred had never abased himself...the martyred populist avatar, the paladin of the people"" Then you get such nuggets as"" John Huey saw ..rendered nugatory the verities that he learned at his grandpa's knee. The high and the mighty..did not rule by tyranny so much as by acquiesence."" Or, finally, ""Her thick tongue thrashed in his glossal roughhouse."" Huh? This book should win ""It was a dark and rainy night"" Award."
3,Yikes!,"With this years election, this book opened my eyes as to how corrupt Washington really is! Couldn't help but feel bad for Jacqueline even though she seemed at times clueless..."
3,I think her 15 minutes are up...,"As someone who spent almost 5 years working in the government in DC, i must say...i guess i was working for the wrong agency! Although i am sure that some of what Jackie (aka Cutler) writes about is true, as in her sexual exploits, the kinds of things she wrote about happening in offices is BS. Most federal employees ARE hard working and DO produce something each day! There is no way that kind of crap could have gone on without the bosses knowing about it and putting a stop to it. I did enjoy the descriptions of restaurants, bars & shops i have been to though. It is possible to have fun in DC without turning yourself into a high priced 'ho! I hope Cutler saved most of what she made from this book...because i think her 15 minutes are UP!"
5,A Favorite,Great book! Amazing illustrations! We bought this for our 8 month old but I would have bought it for myself. When children of my friends come to my house they request this book to read (along with the other Van Dusen books). We are fans!
5,You can't help but love Mr. McGee!,"We were at the Public Market in Portland, Maine during the summer of 2004, where Chris van Dusen was signing copies of this book. Since we spend the summer camping, we bought the book for our son who was 2 years old at the time. We all fell in love with the story, the pictures and Mr. McGee immediatly; and 1 1/2 years later it is still among our favorites! Santa will be bringing Down at the Sea with Mr. McGee this year and I am sure it will quickly become a regular in our reading rotation! I highly recommend this story for kids of all ages!"
2,SKIP this book if you like NOVELS,"When the Nines Roll Over: And Other Stories took me forever to read.It looks like I am the ONLY ONE who did not enjoy this book. Maybe I'mjust not a fan of Short Stories? I didn't ""get"" half the stories. Were there endings?? I wanted to like this book b/c of all the rave reviews but it was more chore than pleasure to read. I would say if you like full length novels you might want to skip this book."
1,Cheap is CHEAP,"I purchased a package of 60 iCellTech Platinum 312 batteries. 16 of the 60 failed immediately. This is a failure rate of 26.6%. They were either dead when I removed the label or failed within 10 minutes of inserting them in my hearing aids. iCellTech Platinum are NOT worth purchasing. Since the date on the package is 11/09/2014 I believe the problem is poor quality control in manufacturing and not old batteries. It is not just the high failure rate, but the inconvenience of having to replace a battery twice when in social situations. There are better alternatives out there. I didn't write this review until I used all 60 of the batteries so I am confident in my conclusions and hope this helps you make an informed decision. Cheap is CHEAP."
1,Buy a better battery !,"I thought I would give these batteries a try being the price was good, but after using a few I found that some of them did not even last 30 minutes. I had purchased Power One batteries prior to these and I think I will go back to that brand."
5,a good deal,"i received the batteries earlier than told . delivery was fast. the batteries are good when i run out i'll order more from the same people. i was happy, i am happy."
5,hearing aid batteries,"recieved the batteries in good order and safety packaged, we have been useing the batteries and all have been consistant."
2,Hearing Aid Battery,"This battery has a slight ""raised"" section on the positive side of the battery. On some digital hearing aids, this can cause intermittent operation. My hearing aids are Starkys, and I cannot use these batteries. I would recomend sticking with rayovac or energizers."
4,Decent battery for decent price.,"This battery does not last as long as the higher end variety. I get a day or so less use before switching. Even with that, the cost makes it a winner. I will order them again when the time comes."
4,Good value for good batteries,"When I was first fitted with hearing aids, a year ago, I started shopping for a lower priced alternative to the small packs sold in drug stores, etc. These are one of those bulk purchases I made. They work as well as the high priced, except occasionally one would die quickly (less than an hour) but I've gotten the habit of carrying a small container (came with my Phonak aids) with a couple spares for each side. It works and saves me a bunch of money. And... I'm still not quite sure if it might have been caused by poor connections on the battery in my aids."
5,hearing aid batteries,ordered this product from canada and had it delivered in 8 days.very happy with service.each battery lasts approximately 4 days in a hearing aid that is used full time. Outlasting the name brand and more expensive batteries.
1,Poor Quality Control,Lifetime on these batteries were very inconsistent. Some lasted for a week most last for 3-4 days and some did not work at all. I was much happier with the ones I got at Costco which sell for $10 for 60 batteries and consistently lasted more that a week and I would change the batteries once a week. Because of poor and unpredictable lifetime of these batteries I had to carry two spare batteries in a holder on my keychain. Ironically this holder came a a freebie with the battery order. Noticed quite a few reviews indicating that these batteries are a great deal than buying them at the local store or their hearing aid specialist which is true. The hearing aid offices sell them for $40 for 40 batteries. My recommendation is to get them at Costco.
5,Totally pleased,"I recently had a need to use hearing aids for both ears. I quickly learned prices for batteries can vary considerably, but can also eat-up a good chunk of cash. For a person on a limited budget, I found it convenient (and necessary) to search the Internet as my source for batteries.The batteries I purchased from iCellTech (#312) are excellent and last as long as those my hearing aid doctor was selling me and are much less costly. In fact, I've had two duds in those I got from the doctor and so far, NONE from iCellTech's batteries. Very pleased and of course satisfied with Amazon's handling of the transaction. Keep it up Amazon, you're TOPS!Joe Cavallaro"
2,Inconsistent batteries,"I recently purchased 60 Power One 312 batteries thru Amazon.com. The merchant that sent them to me, thanked me for the order and included a free 6 pack of iCellTech batteries with a 2013 experation date. I found the Power One battery life averaged 7-8 days. The iCellTech batteries lasted 21 days, which is an average of 3.5 days per battery. The best of the 6 batteries lasted 7 days and the poorest lasted only 10 hours. I'll stick with Power One batteries."
3,Not for me,"These do not have the power to keep the sounds as clear as my aids can provide. The batteries work, but there is a stark difference in sound quality. I will not purchase this brand for that reason. I'm sure these work perfect in many aids just fine, but I keep my aids set with the multi sensoring running in noisy surroundings often which may demand a higher power output. ."
4,Short and Sweet,"Those of us who have enjoyed the Staggerford stories will be brought up to date in this chronicle. It deals with failing health and the need for good friends at any age. We are brought up to date on characters familar from earlier stories, and introduced to new faces. The downside for me was that I wanted to know more about the relationship between Agatha and James, after their time in Italy and Staggerford. Hassler provides us with only a glimpse of this rich period in Agatha's life, and more's the pity. Perhaps Agatha will recount more of this as she reminisces in a future novel. Other than that, it is nice to be back in Staggerford, hearing from Miss McGee."
5,Fabulous CD By George Maharis !,You get George Maharis singing his first two albums on one CD ! Both from 1962 when he was on Route 66. His smooth style made him quite popular with easy listening fans. Particular favorites on this are Teach Me Tonight and The More I See You. George Maharis is an actor who could sing. George Naharis fans will love this !
1,"DON""T USE - IT WILL RUIN YOUR STONE","This stuff is junk. It ruined my brand new Granite counter top.It comes out milky white, blocking the view of the stone.Then, if you apply it as directed on the botlle, using a squeegee,it leaves bumps all over the surface.Now they aren't answering their 800 number.AVOID THIS SUTFF,OR YOU WILL END UP WANTING TO JOIN MY CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST IT..."
2,Worth the long wait?,"We've been waiting so long... the years went by lit up by a snippet of gossip... soon... soon... soon... be patient... the never updated *official* website... rumours... and here it is at last.Alas. :-( The lyrics are not what we have come to expect from Laurie... the rhythms... the melodies... yes, familiar... but nothing reaches out and *GRABS* you by the throat. Its Laurie Anderson gone soft.I love the woman to bits :-) She is my favourite modern artist - and that I suppose makes it all the more sad for me to say... good effort... but try harder next time... please? :-)"
2,DOES NOT WORK,"This compilation does not work, not even as an avant-garde or experimental collection. These tracks may be memories for Anderson, but the album as a whole seems like a collection of fragments with no thread of coherence. If you're a fan, stick with Big Science, Mister Heartbreak, Strange Angels, and maybe Bright Red."
5,worth the wait!,"As a 20 year fan, I love this latest release. Ms. Anderson shows a maturity that should be expressed through the years as an artist. Especially as a pioneer artist. The vocals are outstanding. The instrumentals are, for the most part, very emotional, humorous, sometimes scary, and very artistic. Overall, this is definetly a work of art beyond the confines of pop culture.... I was in the audience for the premier in Dallas and the closing of the U.S. tour in NYC. The music is memorable, but unfortunately lives only in my own brain. I would love to order a hamburger at McDonalds from Laurie Anderson anytime! Thank you for more great inspirational music."
3,"Interesting read, but a disorganized jumble...","I was shocked to discover that volume 2 only covered 5 years, albeit 5 important years. However, that should serve as a caveat for a potential reader.This volume is a much harder read than volume 1 as this version grinds to a screeching halt in places. While I agree it was important to document ERs long, tortured relationship with Lorena Hickock, too much emphasis (and repetition) was placed on what looks to be a normal parting-of-the-ways as ER ascended.There are some very intriguing and thoughtful moments in this book (which makes its a worthwhile read), but they are broken up by too many abrupt harbringers of moral/political doom or redemption with sparse or no follow-up."
2,I gave up,"I have to admit that I gave up on this book. I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt. Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.Look in the ""look inside this book"" section here and go to page 14. This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes. I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article. As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess."
1,Traffickit doesn't work,"I recently purcahsed a TrafficKit for my Maestro 4040. I have driven to several cities after activating the unit and it doesn't work. Calling Magellan technical service is a joke. The do not tell the truth, don't understand what you are talking about and do not carry out their promises.I am going to return the unit as it is worthless."
4,Present for my daughter,Bought this for my daughter as she has a farm with 7 acres so I hope she will get some use out of it. I am sure she will love it.
1,dirty with minor breaks,"when i opened the box and took out the mask, it when really dirty, it had a small breaks on the sides and the string was not in working order to be able to wear the mask,"
4,Surprisingly good,"While the 'legal thriller' genre gets larger exponentially every day, it seems harder and harder to find a really good read - which makes this book a real find. What I loved about the book was its original narrative style, bouncing from an omniscient third person to a sort of research persona, almost as if most of it is a true crime book written after the fact. It gave the book an air of authenticity that was added to by the author's obvious knowledge of the legal system.Even without the unique narrative style and the well-researched legal environment, it is still a book that is marginally better than most books of this type. Overall, a very worthwhile read."
3,Well written suspense which ends disappointingly.,"Well written suspense story with many intriguing legal details. However, the ending in which all the loose ends are very quickly and too neatly tied in a neat package spoils the over-all effect."
3,For B-Western fans,"The four films in this DVD are:1. Trouble in Texas - 1937. 65 min. One of the first Tex Ritter movies. The highlight is Rita Cansino (later renamed Rita Hayworth) performing the Spanish dance that made her famous.2. Call the Mesquiteers - Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan, Bob Livingston, Max Terhune. It's amazing how director John English managed to cram so much action in this 54-minute entertaining picture!3. Without Honor - 60 min. Harry Carey. This is the oldest movie in the DVD and it shows the age.4. Stampede - 1936. 58 min. (Not the Rod Cameron film of 1949. This is an early Charles Starrett film with action scenes shot almost entirely in the timber. Starrett later starred the Durango Kid series."
5,LOVE IT!,"Dog's don't mind it, and it works! Smells fresh and clean and natural. Suggest sitting the bottle in a container of warm water to 'warm' the product to their body temp before use."
2,ROBO PET- Not worth the money,"I got this for my daughter it was pink, she asked for it because her friends had one, I was very reluctant but I gave in and got it. (she is good at that). She did not play with it for very long at all. She does not like it, I paid 50 bucks for this thing, it did break and I was able to fix it the legs and arms are very fragile so this is not good for a child younger than 8 or 9 years old. I played with it for so long and then also became bored. It does many different things has sensors and is kinda high tech yet only does so much and then it is done. Great toy to play with at a store display but not that impressive to own."
1,thumbs down!,"This thing has no fun,no educational value,breaks easily,and of course dumb.It's not even worth 1 star. I extreamly positivly don't recommend it."
3,Previewed at the Library,"I previewed this book, as I do with many of the books I buy, at my local library. I found that it is not what I am looking for in a book on candy making. The book contains lots of recipes but they are mostly just variations on a few main types. I am really interested in hard candies and gummies and there are very few recipes if any at all in this book. In addition it doesn't have any photos. This book is good if you are looking to recreate a heirloom recipe."
1,"Good Pictures, Simplistic Portrayal of Afghanistan","The first thing I had a problem with, right off the bat, was the cover and the title. There is too much focus on the burqa and not enough on real issues. I flipped to the back cover to see the author's credentials and was not surprised to find that the author is really a photographer. I think she would have done better not to have included superficial history and just focused on the women. The history in the book only goes as far as: before, during, and after the Taliban. Everything written is predictable. Before Taliban-good, during-bad, after-good. The history of Afghanistan is, of course, much more complicated than any one regime and I think it is better NOT to have a book like this, than have it. It takes the focus off of other issues and lays the blame on the Taliban and their major offense as the burqa.I gave it one star, though, because of the black and white pictures. The book should have been strictly a pictoral view of these women's lives."
2,"Lots of problems here, despite Ansermet's stylishness","Ricci's Italian style coldn't be more wrong for Prokofiev, and he isn't that secure technically, either. Ansermet's reputation for precision and stylishness in Russian music made me buy this set, but the orchestra is very sloppy and technically deficient--not up to current standards by any means. This one is a definite miss."
1,Choose the seller !!!!,"I bought it from marketplace seller ""Stay At Home Dads, We Know Games!!!"". It comes only disc in poor sleeve without package nor manual, and the disc was very suspicious. I return it."
4,Love this!,"I bought this set at Sam's Club - last one they had. I like the fact that you can bring it in the house and play your ipod thru your stereo or any radio at home as well as in the car.Likes:1. Can charge and listen in the house.2. Handy holder in the car makes the ipod stable and easy to view.3. Comes with cable to hook directly to your stereo at home.4. Sound quality is better than the tape method, radio quality sound, not CD quality sound. Works great for podcasts!Dislikes:1. Some songs volume sems low and you have to have your car stereo or home radio turned way up.2. At home sometimes it's hard to get a signal with no static.3. Can't slide iPod into it without removing your case or jacket.Overall I recommend the transpod over any other method of listening to your iPod in the car!"
3,"A little different, a lot of typos, 3.5 stars...","This one was a little different than Quick's usual fare - not a lot different, but enough so that I could kick the rating up a half a star. The plot was interesting, the characters were developed pretty well, and it had some tension and spark. It wasn't her best work, but not her worst, either. There are a lot of typos in the digital edition. The publisher should definitely get them cleaned up - it impacts the reading, especially in the first half of the book."
2,*rolls my eyes*,"I was okay with this book for the first half, but eventually I'd had it with Gabriel. He was so bossy and insulting. Not that Phoebe was the smartest heroine either. She did some things that were just stupid. I couldn't finish it, I skimmed the last quarter of it. Not a good Quick read."
5,Why don't they make this anymore?,I had one of these prior to purchasing these two. They are really great products if you can get passed the bad instructions for programming. Been 1 day short of 7 months and the second installation (of the 3) died. Batteries are good and the display and manual switch are non-functional after death. Did get replacement from manufacture and all is good.
3,"Right Product, wrong size","The product is great as I have used Day Runner for several years now. The size, however, was incorrect. It should have been smaller (5 x 8). I will assume I had ordered incorrectly and did it again to receive the correct size."
1,"Great cover, but......","I bought this because it was recommended at another book site, and because it has an interesting cover. What a HUGE disappointment. More funny than frightening. Unbelievable characters. Bad ending. Don't waste precious reading time on this one."
5,Even better than the site!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! When you pick it up, you read an entry and instantly you're debating Hein on why and when something jumped the shark. It works not just for TV, but Music, Sports, Politics and Celebs too. I know a ton of people who will love this. Congratulations John, Jump The Shark hasn't jumped yet!!!"
2,Ironically....,"The whole ""jump the shark"" thing jumped the shark when this book came out! I know, about 100 already beat me to that line, but I had to add my piece.JTS on the web is all about TV shows and it's a near-open forum for anybody to slam whatever show they'd like. It's a funny site and a good idea.JTS the book got off to a good start in the first part, which is about television. Then came the jump, with no warning fin whatsoever! JTS on music sounds like my friend in high school who kept saying ""(band name here) was cool, but now they've sold out."" Apparently somebody compiled my friend's thoughts into book form. Things get even worse by the time it starts asking ""When did OLYMPIC BASKETBALL jump the shark??"" Uh, yeah. And I'm not even going to waste more that this sentence on the Politics section.All you need is the website. This book is about 90% unnecessary."
2,Nothing Shaking Here,"I tossed this book after plowing through only 100 pages of overwritten ponderous verbiage. Like the barking dogs before an earthquake, I began to sense that a disaster of a book was shaping up. As another reviewer has noted, this book sorely needed an editor. There was no real action in the first 100 pages. The characters, which Williams spends so much time ""developing"", were cliched. As I read, I kept asking myself ""when oh when is he ever going to get around the the earthquake?"" If a popular work of fiction doesn't grab me by page 100, I aint interested. So, since there wasn't anything shaking by page 100, I just tossed the book and moved on. You wanna read a fantastic apocalypse book, read ""Earth Abides"", instead."
2,break easily and no ties,"The bags break easily, and I need to use a second bag over the first one every time to ensure it doesn't leak or break.Besides, I cannot find the ties as described on the package."
3,"not my favorite, but some good songs.","but maybe i just need to listen to it a few more times.either way i love bright eyes. this one just hasn't quite caught me like the others have.although i have to say, the calendar that hung itself is a perfectly heart wrenching soul rocking song."
1,Oh Please!,"Give me a break, I not only listened to the album a few times but went and saw this guy live based on recommendations of friends. I've got some advice for this guy...if you want to people to listen to songs about your angst and you're not Mark E. Smith, then you best be coming up with meolodies, compelling lyrics, and you REALLY better have a sense of humor. The hype on this guy is obviously the product of rock journalists approaching or crossing the line of 30 years old and trying to stay current with the flavor of the teen angst moment. This guys needs to lighten up or come up with a more entertaining way to deal with his issues. Blecccccch."
5,absolute musical bliss,"conor oberst is amazing... the lyrics are absolutely great. great abstractions and great application to the music. the music itself is quite unlike anything i've heard before... all i have to say is no matter what kind of music you like, if you dig a good melody and even more, excellent lyrics, great songs, and complete innovation, then buy this now!"
4,An Excellent Introduction to Theodore Dreiser,"I have enjoyed ""Sister Carrie"" and ""Jennie Gerhardt"" very much. The lives led by ordinary and extraordinary people before the turn of century is enlightening and makes for compelling reading. Both novels are well paced and realistic and for me, praise from Sinclair Lewis and H.L. Mencken is enough reason to discover Theodore Dreiser.I have not read Twelve Men yet but will in the near future.I also would like to recommend the publisher ""The Library of America"", a non-profit publisher dedicated to preserving the works of America's greatest writers. These volumes are hardbound with cloth coverings, acid free paper, and ribbon markers, a chronology and notes on the text is usually included. In edition to this book I recently read this publisher's tribute to Dawn Powell, an outstanding book and author."
1,A mish-mash of characters and events,"As an avid reader of the mystery thriller genre, particularly British, I was ready for a good time. Unfortunately, this was one of the most confusing, frustrating books I've read. The characters are cartoonish and poorly developed and the riot, (central to the ""plot""), seems contrived and totally unbelievable. Also, the outrage one character evidences when her colleague spills the beans regarding the whereabouts of the pedophile is almost offensive. Who wouldn't want to know that a pedophile is living in a neighborhood with children? A mess of a mystery."
2,Boring!!,"This book is so-o-o boring, repetetive and long. Also extremely naive to the point it sounds like a fairy tale. ""The good guy saves the world""... All of a sudden he now realises that disabled and retired members of this community are very lonely... Everybody understood how wrong their life was before the riot... Please, this is not a real life! ""She went there, he went there, they went there.."" I stopped reading when I was half way done and then just flipped through the pages to see what happened to the main characters in the end. Well, nothing surpising did. In addition I agree with the reader who mentioned ""do not judge by"" concept. This book sends a wrong message in general."
5,My favoirite books,I will give this book five stars becase it is exciting. I love Junie B Jones Hasa a Moster Under Her Bed. Her parents tells her their is no moster under her bed. Her friend tells her their is one. this is my favorite Book.
5,Too Funny!,"I read this book the other day with my 6 year Kindergartener and I don't know who laughed harder, me or her! I encourage her love of books and the Junie B. Jones books are a great way for her to transition from picture books to big kid books. I hope new ones come out on a regular basis, because I am sure will read our way through the current books no time at all!"
3,Have a clear reason for your purchase:,"All, I hope you find this helpful. I will start off by saying that Logitech is a wonderful company and they make great products. I own their wireless mouse and their wireless ClearChat headset. Both of these work excellent and I will recommend them to others.Now, on to this product; it is almost useless to use with the PC. That obviously includes Skype and the others. If you are trying to listen to music wirelessly, you can forget it. It is not strong enough to carry those waves.The most frustrating thing was the Set-up with the PC. You have to be very patient with this thing and play with it to get any faint sound out of it.Finally, I must say it works great as a Bluetooth headset. My conclusion is that don't buy if your primary use is for PC, but you can buy if you need a Bluetooth."
2,cordless headset,I honestly did not like this headset. When I use it the person who I speak to can never hear me or hears me extremely low. The installation process was also a headache.
3,Troubleshooting Connection Was an Issue!,I had the same problem as another person where it worked the first day but not after that. I had to hold down the power button on the headset until it flashed red and blue and the button on the receiver until it was red and blue and then they reconnected. This is a very handy product!
1,You and Me The Skills of Communicating and Relating,I choose not to take the class so I have not read this book yet.
4,Good fit for wife (Youth Size),"wife is petite and fits her well... For me, i would get adult size. Quality seems fine, but she only wore couple times now... I would give 5 stars cept, the numbers do not seem bright/crisp... bit faded (not much, just bit)."
2,Comfy yet not so comfy,"Sandals are comfy at my soles. However, the side of my toes are squeezed and I got blisters. I'll see red colour marks formed by the sandals after wearing it for some time. :("
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book after reading so many 5 star reviews, but unfortunately I found it to be pretty run-of-the-mill as horror novels go. The characters were flat and either all good or all bad, and the plot was suprisingly slow and predictable. The supernatural aspect seemed disjointed and took a backseat to the human villains, and the whole blues guitar element seemed a bit forced and out of place. Didn't hold up to other 5 star horror books that I've read lately such as The Little Stranger, House of Leaves, Horns, The Terror, The Devil of Nanking, Julian's House, or my favorite, Naomi's Room."
2,This book could be half its length,"Myabe I was in a ""mood"" when I read Ghost Road Blues. I felt this book moved waaayyyy tooooo sssssllloooowwwww. I feel this book could have be half its length and still give a good story. Just get to the point. This was my first Maberry book and the others will have to sit on the shelf for a while before I continue reading."
5,A top notch thriller -ghostly and grim,"`Ghost Road Blues' gets off to a quick start and manages to maintain the pace through to a most enjoyable 'heart-stopping finish.' The expectations set up by the book's beginning hold up extremely well, unlike any number of other books in this genre. The characters are likable and the themes and backstory are introduced clearly without becoming bogged down by needless detail. Anyone looking for a great mystery or a supernatural thriller with plenty of twists and turns along the way will not be disappointed by this one. I look forward to more from this author."
2,Ok first book to a trilogy - but I won't be reading the rest,"This is an ok set-up book for a series I guess but there really wasn't anything here that inspired me to want read two more books to finish the story. It's pretty much force of good vs. force of evil in a small town that harbors many secrets. Nothing too original and nothing that really stands out enough to warrant a three novel narrative. Like many 'trilogies', there seems to be more of an interest in making money with multiple book sales than creating a tight, respectable story contained in a single novel."
1,"A good idea, poorly executed","Like many other readers and reviewers, I was expecting a lot more from this book. That being said, I've really got only myself to blame. The author makes no secret that she had only three months experience at Kibu. I'm not sure that I should have expected much more than this often trite, sometimes amusing third-person collection of anecdotes.It's too bad, it would have been a great book. I just hope that she's not serious when she talks in the introduction about film offers. You could take all the substantive moments of this book, shoot them in real-time and not fill one reel."
3,"Entertaining, but ...","Let's start with the good stuff: ""Inside the Cult of Kibu"" is an entertaining tour through the rise and fall of dot-com mania, charting the web's (by now) oft-told tale of enthusiasm, hubris, willful blindness, greed and ultimate downfall... There's much more that could be said about the rise and fall of the dotcoms - the book virtually ignores the B2B story and some of the craziest moments of the era - office landlords demanding friends-and-family stock as a perverse kind of ""key money"" to secure office space! Perhaps only Tom Wolfe could do justice to it all. So ... it's an OK read, and a fast one, but don't put down any major projects to pick this one up."
1,I have never heard of this web site.,Kibu.com? Never heard of it. Here's a thought for anyone else wishing to share their dot-com experience: please move on; it's over and it was a joke to begin with.
1,Did not receive what was described.,"I have ordered this item and out of whole theater system I have received 5 speakers that come with it, but no DVD/VCR combo or remote controles.After talking to cust. service we have returned it back to AMAZON.I am rating it with one star, but it I had choice to I would of given 0 stars."
1,Iran,"According to the author of this book, shah Abbas was born in harem and died as a result of alcohol. Next interesting point was that Qezel Bash smoked weed, eat human and drank booz. All in all, everyone in Iran was drunk, and eating human. I began to have my doubt about this book as a valid source of information."
2,Boring and predictable,"I was hoping for something new from this book, but... It seems that the books are getting SO predictable and SO much alike. I am sick of Vanza and sick of the same characters with different names. PLEASE give us something new!"
2,She Needs a Vacation,"Ms. Krentz, aka Amanda Quick, needs a vacation. She is trying to capitalize on her popularity as both Jayne Krentz and Amanda Quick and the novels are suffering---badly. The last three Quick novels, including this one, were not memorable AT ALL.Don't waste your money on the hardcover--wait for the paperback."
3,"Better than her last few, but...","I've been a fan of Krentz/Quick/Castle, et al., for years, but have found her books becoming more and more formulaic and stiff in the last few years. As I have often found her characters rather formal and serious, something in the plot must spark to liven up things; saddly, for me, that spark has been missing.I enjoyed this Quick more than the last two or three, but must agree with previous reviewers that the books have become too repetitive. I plan to bypass hardbacks in the future. (Of course, I said that about Wicked Widow and the title before that, too.)Bottom line, I have high expectations of this author and will continue to hope she regains her spontaneity."
2,OK if you've never read her earliest books,"Unfortunately, all Amanda Quick's recent heroes and heroines seem like exactly the same people. There's not much here to differentiate this book from Mischief, Affair, or the last two books. If you enjoyed couples such as Augusta and Harry from Rendevous or Gideon and Harriet from Ravished, you'll be disappointed. In addition, the constant references to Vanza drive the reader insane...I think the word appears on every page! However, it is a quick, effortless read, and I WAS surprised by the identity of Madeline's husband's murderer."
2,Be careful what you ask for...,"I kept asking when a new Amanda Quick was comming out. Well you know what they say ""Be careful what you ask for..."" I guess I should have asked when a Good, entertaining and uncliched Amanda Quick was coming out. I feel cheated and am glad I didn'g pay the publisher's price for this DUD! I hope she is working on a good book for next time."
1,Another mass production Amanda Quick novel,"Amanda Quick - please start writing again. Stop getting out the master copy, changing the names and hair colors, and clicking ""Print"".Other Reviewers - I read with amazement reviews from those of you out there who find Amanda Quick's dialogue ""witty"" and ""exceptional"". Any author who uses the phrases ""bloody"" and ""bloody hell"" up to 5 times on one page is not witty. The adjective you're looking for is ""repetitive"" - just like the plots of her last 3 books."
2,Quick burnout?,"Wait for the paperback or get it from the library. It shows her usual witty repartee in places but not enough to carry the story along. Too much of the same. Not enough detail. Again, enough with Vanza, try a new twist!"
4,A very good story,This is an excellent example of its genre - historical romance/mystery. I enjoyed reading it.
2,Not up to her usual standards,"As a rabid fan of Amanda Quick, when this book first came out, I was eager to get it. Once I started reading however, it was quickly apparent that this was not going to as good as her previous books. The plotline was weak, and I didn't particularly like the characters. Artemis was too dark and Madeline was too flaky. Tried as she might, I just couldn't get into this book. If you want to start reading Amanda Quick, start with 'With This Ring' and 'I Thee Wed', they are her best. Hopefully the next one will be better."
1,DO NOT BUY,MR. LEVINE HAS BEEN DEAD FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS EDITION. THIS IS A PARAPHRASE OF THE FOURTH EDITION WHICH MR LEVINE DID WRITE.I WISH I HAD NOT PURCHASED IT. WASTE OF MONEY.
4,A Classic Work Which Deserves Its Status,"This book is a true guide for a wide range of collectors, and would be collectors. I am impressed with its layout, which facilitates the very dense amount of knowledge being offered by Mr. Levine. Seldom have I seen a book of over 500 pages that actually seems to convey more information than its page count would suggest.In other words, if you are really interested in knives at all you ought to own this well crafted book. Why not all 5 stars? My only real criticisms are that some of the graphics should be better and the paper used is poor, (perhaps these two items are related.Anyway, great book, buy it, you will never regret it."
2,Twelve Mile Limit,I found this book Twelve Mile Limit a little boring compared to his other books and a little to detail
5,RAD Mouse!!!,"By far the best mouse that I have ever used! Smooth, elegant, very comfortable. Also, the ergonomic design does not strain my hand. Definitely worth the money!"
3,A disappointment,This is the third generation of Logitech wireless mice that have charging bases that I have owned. This is the first one that I found to be lacking in quality. After two days of use the Quick Search button on top of the mouse started activating randomly about twice a minute bringing up a Firefox window. I had to deactivate the button in software. A disappointment.
1,Uncomfortable,"The shape of this mouse is extremely uncomfortable. My husband purchased the revolution, but did not like it. He gave it to me. With it being so narrow where the heal of your hand sits, it caused my hand to cramp. After 1 week of use, my arm was hurting. My neighbor has extremely narrow hands, so I gave it to her. We purchased 4 spare MX1000 since they are very comfortable."
2,USB Dead,Great product used it for couple months and god knows how much i care about my stuff. after 3-4 months my USB went dead windows could not recognize the device for some reason. i tho the problem is from my PC but after trying the mouse on my laptop and other computers its still the same.other than that mouse was great and am really sad that its not working right now.
5,works well,nice mouse. sometimes have slight (less than half a second) pausing probably due to other wireless devices interfering.
3,Ok mouse..,"Battery life sucks on this thing!! I have to recharge it like every 2-3 days. It's also not good for gaming, well to me that is. I like the feel of the mx 1000 better for gaming than this mx revolution. Plus, i also sometimes get a choppy mouse cursor like once everyday i use it.I wouldn't prefer this mouse if it was for like 50 bucks, but since i bought it for $6, i thought i'd try it out."
2,"Cool features, uncool performance","The ergonomics for my large hands are excellent. I also give the smooth-scroll wheel, side selector, and even quick-search button high marks. Though for the quick search button I'd like to just associate CTRL-CTRL with the button but can't. CTRL-CTRL brings up the Google quick search on my computer.Now for the bad part. The frequent freezes, jerkiness, hangs, and poor wireless performance overall for this mouse make it simply too expensive and annoying for what you have to live with. I've had to move the wireless USB receiver to within a foot of the mouse to make it even usable but still have issues. I might as well have a cord.I have a Logitech G7 cordless laser mouse for gaming and never have freeze or hang issues so I know they can do it. Of course those mouse batteries last less than 2 hours. It looks like in order to get 2 weeks of charge for the Revolution, Logitech sacrificed transmitter power and therefore performance. Way to go!"
2,"Great Idea, poor quality, battery life, wheel mechanics","Would love to be as excited as all the others. Frankly, I was when I first purchased this product. However, 6 months has passed and the battery life has diminished by 50%, of original, max. Also, the wheel used to go into ""free-spin"" mode when you rolled it quickly. It stopped doing that after about 3 months.Do I like it, yes!!! It's still a great mouse. For the price I paid??? Not a chance. This turns out to be just a mouse, after all. Especially once the features that make it so much more than ""just a mouse"" stop working.Just my opinion..."
3,Nice Mouse but Not Reliable,I've had the mouse for a few weeks. I really wanted something that would ease my mousing energy making movements more efficient. I do like the mouse and its pointing and the way it fits my hand.The bad part is that the charging station is completely unreliable. Most of the time when I put it in the cradle to charge it gives me an error. I emailed Logitech about it and nothing. You pay this much for a mouse you want the damn thing to work. Oh well. Be warned. This is my first logitech purchase and will probably be my last.
5,Best in show,"Logitech seems to be the Google of Mice. It simply does everything better than any of it's competition and the MX is no exception. Very well built with a precision feel second to none. Smooth, effortless, precise. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth it.,"The good thing about this mouse is that it has excellent precision. However, there are cheaper mice on the market with the same kind of performance in this area. The real reason that this mouse is so expensive is its clutch-based wheel, which is handy but brittle - mine broke after a couple months of use, and every store display model I have seen is broken as well. Luckily, Logitech has fantastic customer support, but for the price of this model, you're probably better off staying away from it entirely."
3,No middle mouse button,This is a great mouse except for the fact that there is no middle mouse button. that is a huge problem for me - as I use it in firefox. Rest of the mouse is great for reasons that everyone has stated and I wont repeat. Be aware of the middle mouse buttons abscence.
2,OH THE POTENTIAL!!,"If you have a wireless network in your home of office (who doesn't?) then this mouse is a waste of money and time. It will freeze up on you over and over again whenever someone is using wireless. Nothing you can do about it, other than shut down your wireless network.On top of that the reliability of the mouse is not up to stuff. I have used it less than a year, and it registers single clicks as doubles. This drives me crazy.Want to recharge your mouse? It takes 40 tries to get the charging dock to connect correctly with the mouse.These things make this mouse near unusable.But ergonomics and feel of the mouse is great. If Logitech fixes these issues this would be a top notch mouse. But with the severe flaws it has I cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,Excellent but.................,"I bought this mouse in Oct. 2006. It's the most excellent mouse I've ever used. However, after five month, it suddenly ""die"" for no reason. I trust logitech very much. I have six Logitech mice. This time, it really let me down."
2,Great mouse with a huge problem,"This mouse is great: wonderful battery life, good (quiet and easy) click/scroll and lots of buttons, but it has a huge problem.The mouse simply freezes or stutters at random times (usually when something is loading on the computer). This is a huge flaw and makes it useless for games and nearly useless for anything else. No current software updates fixes this problem.I recommend staying far away from this overpriced mouse. If you are a gamer, go for the G7 or G5 by Logitech (I'm back on the G7, I do love most Logitech products). If you are a regular computer user, I suggest going with a Microsoft mouse.I'm using Vista, and after lots of reading: it simply is not compatible with Vista. Steer clear if you are a Windows Vista user."
1,Faulty electronics in a nice design,"There have been frequent failures of this mouse of the DOA kind. Many DOA mice do not communicate with their dongle and the Logitech reset procedure does not help. It isn't clear whether this problem is a design or a production problem.There have even been many DOAs of the same kind with so-called refurb MX Revolutions recently sold by WOOT.For details check either Logitech's customer blog or WOOT's.Note also that Logitech's reset procedure involves six button actions and a switch flip, since there is no reset button on this mouse to reconnect the wireless, a seemingly clear design defect.This is a huge black eye for Logitech, heretofore a company held in high respect."
3,Intermittant trouble using with my Mac,"The look feel and battery life are fine. Programming was easy, although the Mac driver had to be downloaded (it wasn't on the included CD). There are lots of buttons and some can be programmed for application-specific functions, although the number of compatible applications is small.My main problem is that some of buttons do not always do what they're supposed to do. Like, I have progammed the scroll wheel button for expose, but usually when I press it, nothing happens. Maybe 25% of the time, when I press, it works as it should. I expected it to be reliable out of the box. I have not yet called Logitech to complain."
5,Best mouse for everyday use,"I have very large hands and the first thing I noticed about this mouse is that it is the first mouse that hasn't given me hand cramps. I have had this mouse over a year now and the only problem I can say I have with it is that the finnish on the right hand side of the plastic pealed off but hasnt effected the comfort or performance of the mouse at all. If you game it will due as a programable mouse but you may want to look into an actual gaming mouse with fuly programable buttons. For every day use or photoshop use however this is a fantastic mouse. Great feel, comfortable, durable, long batter life, precise and has a great weight. On a side note the weel can be set to either turn in clicks like a standard weel mouse or turn with a smooth glide. 5 star product all the way."
1,La base para cargar es pésima,"Tengo este mouse hace más de un año. La base para cargarlo es pésima, hay que hacer equilibrio para lograr cargarlo."
1,Works poorly on some surfaces - including Belkin mouse pad,The laser seems to track very erratically on the Belkin F8E262-BLK WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad. It is so bad that the cursor jumps around making it difficult to even play solitaire smoothly. Regular Logitech LED mice have no such problem. I can use the laser mouse on a wood desktop without any problems. But it seems that the laser is TOO sensitive for the cloth surface of the mouse pad.
3,Great features but a few perks,"Out of the box, the mouse looked great. All shiny and black. Over the next couple of days I played around with much of its features. Being a frequent gamer, I had an inkling it wouldn't be on par with my old mouse.The mouse, I have to say, after a week or so started showing its bad side. The wireless receiver, which is a small usb dongle, seems to ""skip"" every so often. Basically, sometimes the mouse would freeze on me as I was trying to move it from one pixel to another.- If you can deal with the ""skip"", then by all means go buy it. For me, a nice RMA and a quick refund was the better choice."
1,Not Good Customer Service.,My MX Revolution Dongle stop working in a month. Customer service took 6 weeks to replace. I endup buying another backup mouse. I do not know how long this refurbished mouse is going to survive.
5,Simply the best,Theis is the best mouse going. I love it and yes so does my dog. She chews them and I buy replacements until I learn to keep them out of site.
5,The perfect mouse,Logitech MX Revolution USB Wireless Laser Mouse (Black)First of all I have to say I wish I would have bought this from Amazon and saved about $50. I am however very satisfied with this mouse. It's very comfortable for my long fingers and large hands (gives you a strange mental picture doesn't it). The mouse is responsive and the buttons are easy to use and do exactly what they are programmed to do. The flywheel is great! I do a lot of programming and have to search through lines of code and this makes it so much easier to do so quickly and efficiently. For gamers this mouse is Okay. It's only 800 dpi so sniping can be a bit tough other than that it gets the job done.
2,Firefox users beware-- NO middle mouse button,"I have owned this for less than a day and immediately realized that there is NO middle mouse button, which is absolutely essential for opening and closing tabs in Firefox. You can configure the fancy scroller as a middle mouse click, but then you lose the dual speed functionality, and still you have to click twice for it to work. The button behind the wheel (Search button) would be a perfect place for a middle click, but alas, you can't assign that function to that button. It's crazy--you can make it do about 20 things, but just not a middle click. And none of the other side buttons/scrollers will do it either. Also, the side wheel/document switcher, since it is no better than Alt+Tab, will not let you switch between Firefox tabs.The mouse looks great, is very ergonomic and lots of fun to scroll back and forth with, but useless for Firefox users."
2,"Beautiful, but not functional","It's well designed, it looks good, it feels good in your hand, the scroll wheel is pure genius, but it just doesn't work consistently. Most cordless mice have a signal receiver that sits on your desk, relatively close to the mouse, but the MX instead has a small USB stick receiver, like a thumb drive. That's probably good if you take this mouse around with your laptop, but it's bad for a desktop PC. This small stick receiver is in your PC, probably significantly further away than a desktop receiver would be, and it's just not ideal for receiveing the mouse's signal. I am continually frustrated by the mouse's frequent periods of unresonsiveness. It's maddening, really and truly. I'll probably have to settle for a mouse I like less that actaully works all the time to save my sanity. But don't take my word for it--Google this product, and you'll see lots of folks complaining of the same thing."
3,Review of Logitech MX-Revolution Mouse,Pro: Good ErgonomicsCon: Requires frequent battery re-charge.Battery NOT replaceable. If it fails you have to buy a new mouse.
1,Dry and poorly written,"This book is the dryest and most poorly written one I have read in a long time. First it starts out telling us what certain individual terrorists did. The problem is, the author throws around so many arabic names that you have no idea who he is talking about from one parapgraph to the next. The individual actions of the terrorists don't amount to much and you wonder what the big deal is. The author simply throws things together without any flow or continuity. He may be a counter terrorism expert but a book writer he is not."
3,One of the leading analysts on Terrorism....,"Read ""Infiltration"" and the works of Robert Spencer for a more comprehensive, detailed and balanced coverage of the subject of Jihadists in the United States. Although this book has less of the tiresome partisan finger-pointing about what administration is more to blame (although describing our current state as primarily a result of the Clinton Administration's lackadaisical approach, he does mention the current admins reluctance to deport illegal immigrants for fear of offending Hispanic voters), I give it a 3 stars for being way too short in length. 166 pages of text in large print followed by documents in an appendix."
2,A lot of cheerleaders,"The book is OK but certainly not as good as the reviewers proclaiming ""Just Buy It"" Something smells fishy, almost as if a single individual or group wants to hype the book. I thought the book had some good information. It is about a chapter worth of material compressed into 167 pages with plenty of fluff. I'd recommend ""Infiltration"" by Paul Sperry if you are interested in the subject."
1,Sacreligious,"Comments like I feel her with me, her healing power, etc, continue to prove sacreligious. Mary was a person. There is only One God. Mary cannot save. Only Jesus can. Period."
3,Music from the Real World,"This CD is an interesting collaboration, considering you've got a couple of different types of music on it, from pop rock (Toad the Wet Sproket) to techno (Crystal Method) to punk rock (MXPX). For people who hate to have one type of music label all their listenings, this CD is for you. The CD gives you a little taste of everything, even some country music to the disdain of many. Be ready to be diversified, but don't expect to recognize many of the songs on this CD. Buy it if you listen to every genre of music."
1,Communism lives on,Steer clear of this if you don't want a brain chip in the future. Marxism in sheeps clothing. Vile stuff.
2,Cheaper else where,"This is a very good seris. However, the price just went up. My suggestion. If you have a store near you called ""Vintage Video"", check there. I found this exact same complete seris for $10 less. Plus I didn't have to pay for postage and wait the 3-5 days to get it. Just a helpful hint."
3,Not what I thought,This is nothing more than a dictionary for family therapy terms. I was hoping for some ideas on family therapy by L'Abate. They ain't here.
5,DRY DRY DRY. These really dry!,I don't use these for my dog. These make the BEST DISH CLOTHES ever! Red ones are labeled for dogs and aqua ones for travel. I just remove the labels and use them in the kitchen. You will never go back to anything else.
1,wrong book,I received the 7th edition. I already have the 7th edition and it is fine. The sample exam was not far from what I actually took. But I wanted a different sample exam to practice. That's why I ordered the 6th edition (shown in the picture). Disappointed in the seller...not the book. I will be trying to return it.
1,"Silly, silly book",This book could have been written in two pages. After the first two pages the rest of the book is just filled with silly examples written in boorish English. The book is graphically inappropriate and a waste of time. If you are interested in this book just read the cover and save your money.
2,OMG!!,"I bought this for work to organize lesson plans for my teachers, it was easy to put together but was not stable and sturdy. Should have paid the extra money for the real wood."
3,2.0 not 5.1 as advertised,"Disc is only2.0 not5.1 as adverised onthe cover.Purchased for one song; a cover of Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine"" - The rest is pure crap-- screaming.Edd Kerr[...]"
4,well-rounded selections-well restored.,"This is a must-add to all Miller fans! The Moonlight Serenade cut is not the usual one heard on older efforts. Stardust sounds like it was written for the Glenn Miller Band.Good sampling of GM""s Best!"
5,Wonderful holiday fare,"What a delightful compilation. We were particularly taken with ""What a wonder is a life"" and the beautiful voice in ""Simple ways"". The innocence and wonder of Tiny Tim is evident in the finale ""One more chance"". The scrooge trio was fabulous, what a unique way to explore this character."
2,Only worked once,"I ordered two of the batteries for my JVC Everio GZMG77. I have always charged them with the Cta Digital Mini Battery Charger I also got with them. The first time I charged the batteries, the camcorder showed that the batteries had a full charge. I didn't use the batteries for a while after that, and so I recharged them, and now one of the batteries won't even turn on the camcorder, and the other one shows that there is only 10mins of battery life.The charger shows a green light indicating that the battery is fully charged. Over all...they just didn't work for me."
3,a fair review,"Simple, yet eloquent. As for this reader, Gemma and Tar do not conjure up feelings of sympathy. And cronies Rob and Lily most certainly give rise to feelings of disgust. I did not feel especially bonded to any of the characters, except maybe for the adventurous Richard, who, for some reason, is not developed by the author. Overall, I would recommend this book to individuals who are interested in adolescent psychology and addiction. For anyone else, it is merely a didactic exposition dealing with socially troubled teens who become entagled with an insidious drug."
5,heroin,"this book was really good and i enjoyed reading it, the beginning seemed to drag on but later on in the book it began to get interesting and i really liked it. the growing epademic of heroin usage is amazing and this book shows the real side of kids my age using the drug and how is messes up their life. its a narley book."
1,"Boring, boring , boring","Blech. I hated this book. I read a lot of ""high drama"" books about teen issues as I work with teens who find themselves in this genre. Unlike Speak, or Crank, or even Cut, Smack is a book that doesn't connect with anyone. Oh, and did I mention that it is boring? Don't be misled by the other reviews, this insipid ride to unbelievable town doesn't belong on your bookshelf."
1,This Book is a disappointment and deadly boring !,"This Book is a disappointment. Now, how do I explain my previous statement? Well, this is my initial impression about the book once I received it and started browsing through it. I'm unfortunately unable to get attracted to this book, I force my self to open it and brows through it, nope, zip, nothing, it does not stir any feeling in me. I watched the moon landing in 1969, sat many nights watching the moon and the stars; still I do not like this book. I do not feel like showing it to anyone, because I will not be able to show any enthusiasm in practically all the pictures!!. Sorry !!!. The Moon is Magnificent, Apollo Missions are Magnificent, but this book is deadly boring and a waste of money. You want a magnificent book; try Cosmos by Giles Sparrow or Saturn: A New View by Laura Lovett, these books set the standard for Captivating and Awesome Books the show the true beauty of our universe. The Moon and Apollo deserve such a Book."
5,Few words can describe the power of these images,"Never has a scientific record become such a powerful work of art as ""Full Moon"". These images of our lifeless neighbor invoke the human spirit in its most profound moments. From the eerie glow surrounding an astronaut in the distance to the family photo laying on the grey surface, ""Full Moon"" gave me chills."
4,So that&#65533;s where I went wrong . . .,"A great read what an insight to mothers and relationships. With great examples Alyce Faye demonstrates different mother relationships. A great insight, well written - and I would recommend this."
4,"Readable, insightful way to see relationships","This book is full of stories of real people who have gained new insights about their relationship to their mothers. Sometimes it has come from recent converations about events of long ago, and sometimes just from a new way of looking at what we thought we knew. It is very readable and includes steps for a better relationship."
1,this is not a franklin covey CLASSIC size binder,"This is a nice binder. When it arrived, it was filled with pages marked DAY RUNNER. When my Franklin Covey CLASSIC pages arrived, they were larger than this binder. I am in the process of returning the binder."
4,Great read,"John Sandfords Prey series and Virgil Flowers are probably more like actual police ""who done it"" than most other authors withe the exception of Michael Connelly."
4,"Grusome, yet riveting",Action packed from the word go -- and graphic to leave nothing to the imagination. An excellent murder/mystery that will keep you guessing to the end...
2,Not the Boston Pops,"I saw the price and thought - ""what a deal"". Well, you get what you pay for! The songs are definitely NOT by an orchestra. Go with the Boston Pops or London SO versions."
5,VINTAGE SCI-FI,GOOD OLE SCI FI WHEN THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT!! GOOD TO SEE THE OLDIES AGAIN
1,Lousy Mach 3 Blades!!!,This was the worst purchase I ever made. The blades cut me face!!! I had to contact Gillette to get re-imbursed. They sent me coupons for future purchases. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap. Never again!!!!
4,Wrong thing but turned out great!,"We ordered 15 of these and we rec'd 15 Goodie Bags instead which did contain the same fun items. We were especially sad not to have the ears. But when I called the vendor, they shipped out (next day) the correct items and we got to keep the original Goodie Bags too. We'll have a deluxe party favor kit for our pary tonight. Thanks!"
1,Save your money!,"One star is too many! I've tried many of these recipes for my 2 yr. old, and he'd taste it and then turn up his nose. He is not a picky eater! He loves shrimp, broccoli and even eats salad. I thought these recipes would be a fun addition to his regular menu. Don't waste your time on this book. You can come up with healthy creative recipes on your own. Buy some mini muffin tins and buy the cookbook Quick and Healthy II..... take any of the quick bread recipes and bake them in the mini muffin tins and you've got healthy treats for little fingers. Take any of your favorite recipes and bake them in mini loaf tins and you'll have tasty food for little fingers. This book should be called yucky food for little fingers! If anyone would still like a copy, send me... to cover shipping and you can have mine!"
2,Frustrated,"I was a little disappointed with this purchase. I was hoping it would last me a few years, I'm not so sure it will. When putting it together the glue and four little wooden pegs would not support the frame up. I had to add 6 screws to hold the shelf together. After doing that it still was a little flimsy, but it did stand up. When purchasing it I didn't realize that the actual letter compartments are only made out of cardboard. We will see if it lasts..."
1,All is on the net,"We were really disappointed when we discovered this book. I was looking for JFIF file format explanations, and they only explain in detail common formats like BMP (et encore !!!) that you can find anywhere on the net. So really just a review of internet, useful for the one that has no printer. Really if i could get my money back i would do it."
1,Disappointed to say the least,"I have been an avid Celestial tea drinker for a number of years and thisby far was a favorite of mine, until they changed it.Not only did the company decide to package it differently , they have alsoadded a blend of white tea in it. In my opinion they ruined a perfectly goodproduct.The tea itself seems weaker to me, not smoother.For the past year, this tea, prior to the change, was difficult to find in my localgrocery store. I purchased it online and was fully satisfied until the last shipment arrivedand the new tea was sent. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again unless the company returnsback to the original , which was superior to this by far.Why oh why can't companies leave things alone? New does not necessarily mean better and in this caseit rings true."
2,Likable read- no direct skills,"I thought this book would offer more in the way to make changes in your home, instead it is a nice narrative of people who have been helped by the author. I prefer a direct ""how to"" approach, and this was not it - very disappointing. Gregory Bodenhammer has two books on this topic that are more direct, concise and to the point. I found that ""Back in Control"" and ""Parent in Control"" had a lot of useable information."
5,Empowerment and Respect,"This book is fantastic. I have spent the last ten years learning how to raise a very, very difficult child/teen. Much of what I learned in expensive therapy and specialist programs is covered in Edgette's book - and more effectively than in any of the many, many other books I've read. Stop Negotiating with Your Teen is concise and easy to understand. Edgette has a thorough understanding of these kids and the challenges they present. She doesn't try and create a standardised perfect parent. Instead she offers a practical, common sense approach to parenting that empowers parents to parent as leaders. She also helps parents to help their difficult teen make better choices. Siblings and parents alike benefit from the ensuing changes. Everyone in the family wins."
5,10 Stars!!!,"No review will do this book justice. I would give this novel 10 stars if I could. I haven't read a book that has kept me up until 2am in years. Then came along Tatia and Shura. Paullina Simons puts you in Tatiana's body and makes you feel what she feels.. her love, her pain, the conflict. It is a beautiful story."
5,Best Love Story against a historical backdrop,"The story of Tatiana and Alexander is one of the best love stories I have read in a long time. The backdrop of history that sets the story is so vivid and sad and real that it makes the love story all that more poignant. This is the best book I read in 2011 and I can't even begin to recommend it enough. If you love Outlander or Katherine, give this book a chance. You won't be disappointed!"
5,An Amazing Love Story,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. I was hooked from page one and found myself getting deeper and deeper into this incredible tale. I was fascinated by the look at wartime Russia and obsessed by the incredible, heartbreaking, wonderful love story. I did virtually nothing but read this book for three days. Then when I got to the last page, I turned to the beginning and started reading again. I have never done that before in my life, but no book I have ever read has affected me like THE BRONZE HORSEMAN.Please, Ms. Simons, write a sequel. The story of Alexander and Tatiana must continue."
4,Wonderful,"I'm not much into romance novels, but this had everything I wanted and the love story really drew me in. Action, intrigue, honour and respect coloured the backdrop of a history I'm not very familiar with. The characters were brilliant."
5,Wonderfull! You sink into the narrative and don't want to leave.,"I heard about this trilogy that it was good. It took me a while before I started, but once I began to read it was a real joy. The author succeeds to make her heroes very real and to make the reader be involved, take sides etc. Very easily read and is really hard to leave it every time but a real joy to return to it.Can't wait to begin reading the 2nd book and continue the adventures together with the heroes."
5,Sucked me in by page 25!!!,Not sure I've ever been so quickly hooked by a novel. This is an amazing story that takes place in a horrible period of Russian history. I'm learning things that I certainly didn't know about that period while being immersed in the incredible love story between Tatiana and Alexander. A must read!!!
3,"Good Read ""But""",It was a good read but a bit too long for the story. Near the end it was dragging a bit.
5,Favorite book of all time,"I have never read a book before this one that made me feel so much part of the book or made my heart literally ache at times. This was probably the longest book I have ever read and wish it could have been 5,000 pages +. I couldn't get enough of it and recommended it to everyone I knew. Everyone who read it, absolutely fell in love with it as well. Imagine my excitement to find out there was a book 2 & 3!"
4,Goose Bumps in May,"While riding to the beach from Charlotte, NC, I popped this CD into the player. Man, it was great from the start. No corruption of the melodies we all know so well, no interpretive license employed...just the sweet sound of those fight songs we all love. Had goose bumps listening to it and it wasn't even October! Gave it four stars. Maybe I'm just being a bit too pristine, but I want the fight songs the way the actual bands from these wonderful American universities play them. There were a few very small alterations that most wouldn't notice...but I did, so its four not five stars. The quality of the CD sound is good, but not great. Dispite these minor factors, its a ""buy it"" for sure."
3,The Time is off.,The CD says that certain songs example Georgia Tech's fight song will play for a longer time in reality the song ends about 40 seconds to soon. Some songs actually play a longer amount of time than listed.
4,Great for first time physics students,"I am in college, studying drafting and design theories. Part of the curriculum is a two hundred level physics class. I was so lost the first few days of class and was struggling to maintain a B average. I ordered this book and recieved it a few days later. It explained the concepts of most of my physics homework in a way that made a lot more sense to me. All in all I finished the class with a 95.6% grade point average. I thank the writer of this book for all his wisdom, it was the best eighteen bucks I spent all summer."
4,Great book,This book is well prepared and easy to read. It does take into account that you are using the other 2 manuals to assist in understanding this course information.
4,Native American - GREAT,"This story tells of Native American brothers by an author who knows. [from the back of the book] THE BROTHERS OF ROCK RIDGE: bound by blood, and steeped in the traditions of their Navajo heritage, these sexy brothers live their lives by their own rules - and love against all odds. -- Navajo lawman Ashe Redhawk and his new partner, beautiful FBI agent Casey Feist, struck sparks off each other the moment they met. That didn't stop Ashe from wanting all of her -- her lips, her touch....her secrets.But Casey had come to the reservation to investigate the mysterious deaths of Ashe's foster parents, and he suspected she knew more than she let on.As their passion boiled over, Ashe discovered this time that trusting his instincts was not enough. This time he'd have to trust Casey with the one thing most sacred to him: his heart ********* A good mystery, plenty of movement, a good read."
3,Nice and Compact,"This cookset appears to be of good quality stainless steel, nests well and with the provided sack is a compact set. The so-called plates are only 5.5 inches in diameter, just big enough to hold a nice size hamburger patty. The handles are a little tough to hold , but manageable. Surprisingly the ""sporks"" work well. Overall a good quality cookset that will stand the teat of time."
3,"Good, but loses the reader in the end.","I really enjoyed Peril's Gate. Wurts demonstrates a genius for writing and imagery that makes it easy to become engrossed and totally consumed into her worlds. Her descriptions of the stuff of what reality really is beyond what we can physically see is inspired and thought-provoking. I did, however, like so many others, have to gloss over the last part where Arithon is in Davien's cave. I agree about the rehashing, and was thoroughly annoyed. I was enjoying the book immensly right up to the climax, which turned out to be anti-climatic. I love what she does with the story and all it's twists and turns, but the imagery and description become boring and slows the pace of the book to a standstill. It's a shame such a wonderful story is finally undone by the over-long and arduous rehashing and self-examination. How much can one man suffer? Again, I love the story, the characters, the places, etc. Hopefully, the next book will have more story and less words."
4,Excellent Buy,"My 10-year old absolutely loved this gift at Christmas. Talk about imagination running wild... he and my 16 year old (yes, my 16-year old) who are football fanatics took this game and playtime to another level. It was equally exciting to see my 16-year old dive right into the imagination with the 10-year old. This is a great buy for any football fans with a huge imagination."
3,Wrong Color,I have been wanting to get these for my 6-year-old son and finally ordered them at what I consider a high price. I figured if I wanted a specific color I would have to pay a high price. I ordered the green vs. the black figures for a reason because my son's flag football team is green - but when I opened the shipment the figures are black and gold and gray and blue. It is a good thing we are Steeler's Fans because the black and gold are the Steelers colors. I don't understand why would they advertise this as the green vs. black set when it is clearly the black/gold vs. gray/blue set. I could have purchased this color at Toys R Us for less money.
5,Ellis throws sideways glance at glad mad guru,"Read trey's new book. It's about a self-help guru who goes a little too far for society's taste as he veers from ""acceptable"" behavior into the realm of megalomaniacal and quasi-mystical dillusion. In the process he drags along a bunch of gullible, souls who think all the big answers flow from his golden throat and his prodigious, erm...karma. How does the main character, Austin, an upper class African-American, go from a being relatively normal, if some what over achieving motivational speaker, to a man hunted by the feds for debunking dim middle class rubes out of their money and their wives...? It's a journey marked by wasted human lives and many empty cases of Evian water. We can see the end coming, but Trey gives us such a wickedly obnoxious blend of pretense and idiocy, that we can't help laughing all the way."
1,Very weak,"This book is very disappointing. It's understanding of geology, geography, surface processes, hydrography, etc, is very weak - on par with perhaps sixth or seventh grade reading, scientific and knowledge levels. The photographs are of poor quality.Not recommended"
3,MegaloMayor,"This is a forceful account of an extraordinary series of events in modern American history by one of the principal actors. It should become required reading by any student of public administration, if only because clear principles for leadership are presented, then illustrated by practical examples. It is an important contribution to governance literature at a crucial level of government. However, we should not be blinded by administrative brilliance following 9/11, and forget to note that the book is relentlessly self-serving, anecdotal and personal, as well as highly selective of the indicators by which he wants his performance to be judged."
3,Good at the Fundamentals. Innovative? Not quite...,"Giuliani's ""Leadership"" is quite a good overall look at what it means to be a leader. It does not tread any innovative ground, but its biographical anecdotes give some insight into his life. One lesson I did glean from this book was the idea of the ""morning meeting"" and how done every day they can be an effective way of managing a cumbersome bureaucracy and ensuring everyone stays accountable. I would recommend this book to leaders just starting out, someone who wants an easy to digest review of the fundamentals of leadership, or anyone who is a fan of Giuliani the man."
4,Well written...,Well written...I enjoyed the book tremendously but really can't say that there was anything missing or too much but you can definitely tell the 9/11 event had major impact on this book. I've always thought Giuliani a bit of a lightweight when it came to conservative politics but reading the way he organizes departments and his life I can see that there does beat the heart of a true conservative...just not one that could get elected as a Republican here in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional district.
2,No False Modesty,"Rudy Guiliani turned New York City around and acted decisively during and after the 9/11 attack. He describes this with no false modesty, nor any kind at all. As far as a leadership book, he discusses HIS leadership, but the applicability of his beliefs(""Be your own man"", ""Everyone is responsible all of the time"") is dubious if you don't face precisely the same kind of challenges he did. If you want to delve into the mind and actions of a man in charge of a great city, this is a good book to read or listen to. But it is not a leadership guide. It probably should have been titled something like ""The Way I Led New York"", not ""Leadership"" although the latter probably allowed for a better marketing campaign."
3,More of an auto-biography than a book on Leadership,"Interesting book, although it could have been shorter. Something that seemed conspicuously absent was mistakes he made and how he might have become a better leader by learning from them. His inside look at the tragedy of Sept 11 was very interesting and brought back a lot of memories and emotions. Thoroughly enjoyed reading about the recovery efforts."
2,MUST HAVE GOT A LEMON,"WE WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS STICKER BOOK. MY 3YR GRANDSON IS AN EXPERT AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN 5 STAR PERFECT, EXCEPT ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE STICKERS STUCK AT ALL. WE HAD TO SCOTCH TAPE EVERY SINGLE ONE DOWN. I HAVE TO WONDER IF THE WAREHOUSE THEY CAME OUT OF MAY HAVE HAD EXTRA MOISTURE, OR SHIPPING ETC, AS THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE GREAT AND I'VE HAD WONDERFUL LUCK WITH AMAZON. THEY ARE THIS HOMEBOUND GRANDMA'S BIG GO-TO PLACE."
4,Its hot in Palm Beach!,"I am a huge fan of S. Woods, and I LOVE Stone Barrington. He's one of my most favorite continuous characters to read. I have to say I did thoroughly enjoy this book. The humor between Stone and Dino keeps the reader involved. I have to say that I would love to see the Arrington and Stone relationship a little more explored (I guess I'm just the true romantic, you know wanting to see the impossible happen)but I loved the conflicts between him and Dolce and Allison/Liz. I can't wait to read The Short Forever, its on my list NEXT!"
5,Great Situations,Stone is a great protagonist who leads reader into and out of stimulating situations. Stuart Woods has great timing and a variety of situations that often take the reader to a different level. Thanks
1,Not his best work,I think it is time for Stuart Woods to invent another set of characters for his books. Cold Paradise was a true dissapointment from such a talented author.
1,Ending?,"I was very disappointed in this book - especially the ending. It was so thrown together that I could not believe that the editor didn't say, please rewrite this....no way was she going to blow her cover that way and for them to so easily find out. I won't buy his books again for a long while."
1,Do Not Work,"Needed for button above zipper on a pair of jeans. Bought first package, tried all 4 and all 4 came apart. Thinking it might be a bad batch, went to a fabric store, bought another package, first one, same thing!Just ordered via Amazon:Guaranteed High Quality Brass Kit, 8 Set with Tool Jean Tack Buttonsby DIMEBUTTONS (Free Shipping, too)Will update the results."
5,The Band AKA does it again....,"The Band AKA never lets me down. This album is another hit, full of funky beats, love ballads, and catchy grooves. They surely are the Masters of the Game. They took over the UK, and now with this reissue, they will take over the US!"
3,It was Okay,"I thought this book was very bland. The story doesn't pick up until you get close to the end. The main character lacked depth and a name. It just seemed like the entire book was merely about the day to day issues with the main character. Based upon the descriptions of the surroundings, the book painted a very boring portrayal of the city of New York."
3,good book but no caucasia,authors attempt to create a dark paranoia chronicle. it was good storytelling but had no real point.
4,Something different for a change,"Lots of unique games as well as spins on some of the old classics. I purchased this for my Grandmother and appreciated the fact I was able to adjust video settings and the size of the cards for her. She was reluctant at first, but once she started playing some of the games she has enjoyed it."
5,Entertaing Guide to Poker and to Life!,"If you're a big fan of the original TV seris from the (1957-61 staring James Garner and Jack Kelley) you'll love the book. (The book, BTW, was written in the early 60's to capitalize on the success of the original TV show, not the silly Mel Gibson movie in 1994 or the various TV sequels staring Charles Frank or James Garner again.) Like the original seris, the book is very entertaining and offers a cornicopia of wisdom and lessons that can be applied not just to Poker, but to Life (Relationships, Women, and Work-lot better than recent pop psychology junk now writtem). One of my favorite quotes from the book is ""My pappy always said you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time. Those are pretty good odds!""Book's also great for the novice poker player, but not really for serious or exerienced players."
5,Perfection,"One of Rossini's best operas, the Barber of Seville, is immortalized here in another one of Dover's fine scores. From the fast-paced overture to the ""Figaro"" aria (both made famous in old Bugs Bunny cartoons), this opera is nonstop greatness.As usual, Dover has provided us with a book of the highest quality: they sew their books instead of gluing them so as for them to stay bound and be flexible, and they print legibly. Unfortunately, legible print is becoming disappointingly rare in modern scores, but Dover is the exception.For a great score of a great opera at a great price, you can't go wrong with Rossini's Barber of Seville."
2,HORRIBLE FOOTAGE,"I'm a Bon Jovi fan, but don't be fooled by this video. It was clearly a misfire by the band. It contains footage from the ""NEW JERSEY"" world tour, but it is palced without any cohesion, with ridiculous effects by the camera. Well, the minute you start seeing the video, you wanna throw it away."
1,Cheap price = cheap quality,"The company I work for recently purchased two of these literature organizers for use in one of the departments. I was given the task of assembling them and putting them in place. While I have assembled many pieces of furniture in my lifetime, this was by far the lowest quality. This product is easy to assemble but doesn't have features that make it durable for long-term use. The shelves are cardboard, and the so-called ""label channels"" (also part of the structural rigidity of the piece) often pop off when removing items from the unit causing the related shelf to immediately bend under the weight. Also, the glue that comes with this item is of poor quality. Use a professional wood glue instead. Overall, I'd say that this item is a waste of money. If you're purchasing this unit for your office I'd recommend buying something more durable. Spend the extra money and buy an alternative item that will last for more than a year."
4,Tons of fun!,"This is such a great toy for my almost 3-year old. I do insist that we only play it together (or with me right there), so that we don't lose the tiny pieces. My daughter loves dressing up the princesses and so do I! The only downside I see is that the stickers are so thin you can see the princesses underwear through them! But overall I just love this."
5,A Thumping Good Read!,"To borrow a phrase from ""The Common Reader,"" Allan Weisbeckers' book, ""In Search of Captain Zero,"" is a thumping good read! I laughed, I cried, I worried, I was ultimately very satisfied. Weisbecker is one of a rare breed who can tilt at windmills and win. And even rarer, Weisbecker is a boy whose crazy journey makes him a man. I loved this book!For some extra fun check out this guys web site at ............................ . He is a prize winning photojournalist whose fantastic pictures taken during his two years in Mexico and Central America greatly enrich the spirt of the book. If you haven't read the book (shame on you), the web site provides a stunning virtual vacation!"
3,Would you buy a condo from this man?,"This book is a lot of fun and a great read. You get to hear about the author's wild adventures traveling, surfing and smuggling. Some of the adventures strain credibility but, even if fiction, they are amusing. What is more amusing, however, is after 328 pages of regaling you with how he smuggled dope, couldn't develop a mature relationship with his girlfriend, abandoned his elderly parents, and was to too lazy to help his cokehead ""best friend"", the author directs you to his web site where he tries to sell you beach front property in Costa Rica. You can trust him, he points out, because Sean Penn will be playing him in the movie.This guy is funny alright, but his best jokes are not in the book."
4,A Blessing,Un excelente SIDUR que refleje el espiritu de la plegaria judía desde la perspectiva del judaismo progresista . En general sigue la estructura y distribución tradicional del sidur reformista. Los cambios introducidos en la AMIDA y el texto postrero al SHEMA parecen interesantes
1,Disappointing,"After reading Lauri Ward's first book, ""Use What You Have Decorating"" I was more than anxious to know the inside secrets to her style of decorating. What I found was a very ""by the book"" and old fashioned way of decorating. On several occasions she stresses the needs for matching woods and metals to others in the room. ""Don't mix light woods with dark woods, don't mix brass with pewter. Keep ceilings white, etc."" I think that's what separates my home from a showcase home. The contrasts allow for my personality to come through. I much prefer Christy Ferer's Breaking the Rules. Hang onto your money, there are lots more decorating books with fewer rules that make decorating fun!!!"
2,Not worth it,"I did not find this book helpful. It did not have that many decorating ideas. It mostly was about how to get organized and how you should keep your home clean. In other words, basic common sense. I am glad I did not buy this book. I was able to find it at the library, so it saved me from wasting my money. I actually found more useful information on the internet. Maybe her first book is better, but I will not buy it until I actual see it."
1,Not Much Help,"I wish I could get the money back on this one. I love the idea of ""using what I have"", but the author sure doesn't give you much leeway on RIGHT and WRONG. I prefer suggestions, not barked orders (i.e. ""whatever you do, don't do this....."" and ""never ever do this...."") I kept thinking throughout the book that having the author decorate my house would be like letting my mom do it: ""I know what's best for you, dear."""
1,#1 already?,"How could this be #1 when it's just out? I'm beginning to wonder if I can trust what amazon says about which books are most in demand. This book has a strange title, and the author is no one I've ever even heard of."
2,Mere placement,"While this book may offer good ideas on placement of furniture and wall hangings, what it doesn't consider is that many of us are restricted by outlets, cable hookups, windows, etc. There's only so much we can do to a room with these restrictions. So putting the tv on one wall may look better, but you may not be able to plug it in. Plus, it's all living rooms or family rooms, no bedrooms or office space. If you're looking for a book to help you maximize space and look like you know how to decorate, this isn't the book for you."
4,cute introduction to gardening,"I actually think this set is pretty cute. The hanging baskets will hang on the front of the loving family twin time house. The flowers all come out of the baskets and hanging baskets so you can rearrange them. It has a small shovel for ""planting"" the flowers in the dirt. This is my favorite part. When you finish planting them (wearing the cute apron which fits the adult dolls), you can water them with either the hose or the watering can.It also looks adorable on the small patio off of the parents' room with french doors in the twin time house. Very cute touch! I think it is a great way to introduce small children to gardening."
4,latitude attitude,"When I visit New Orleans, Dominique's Restaurant is my favorite, so I was excited to see he had put out a cookbook. I found many of my favorites from his menu in the book which was great. It is obvious Dominique is an extraordinarily talented chef who has traveled the globe and his cuisine reflects it. His use of Asian ingredients and light approach to French food is indeed refreshing...especially coming out of a city like New Orleans. If you can't make it to his restaurant, pick up his cookbook and try your hand at his recipes. You will love the unique taste of the dishes. Here is a chef who treats food with respect and elevates it to an art form...something lacking in many of the showman T.V. chefs of today."
3,A somewhat dated classic,"""Through the Patient's Eyes"" is one of the books that brought the concept of ""patient-centeredness"" into the stream of healthcare consciousness. That term became one of the 6 domains of quality identified by the Institute of Medicine in their treatise ""Crossing the Quality Chasm,"" largely influenced by ""Through the Patient's Eyes"" and other work of those authors. This work describes findings from focus groups of patients and families regarding the experiential aspects of healthcare delivery. At the time that the book was first written these concepts were novel. Now they're not, though they're still just as important, and gaps in care are still quite prevalent. Worthwhile reading for clinicians and healthcare administrators alike."
5,How did she live through it?,"I've known Suzy since grade school. I spent many hours at her house with Myrta and also met her daughter as a small child. We lost touch for many years, and I was so delighted to rediscover her in 2000 - after all her troubles. She mentioned she was going to write a book about her time caring for her mother and daughter and I couldn't wait for it to come out.I received my advance order as soon as it was published. I read it through in one sitting and my admiration for this remarkable woman grew tenfold. Her story is told with compassion and humor. Even though the subject matter is very sad, I found it very inspiring. It's the story of one woman's survival through monumental tragedy.My only question is ""Suzy, how did you do it?"""
1,Warning about Visiontek rebates,"The 256 MB Flash drive works OK, but does not seem very sturdy and cannot be attached to a keychain. It is more expensive than similar drives, and the rebate they offered when I bought it was worthless. You only have 15 days from the day you order the drive to send in the rebate and since it took almost two weeks before I got it they refused to honor the rebate. Emails to VisionTek go unanswered."
4,"Great on HD, less so on Analog","The HD picture is spectacular, especially after I connected component video cables. Regular TV is big disappointment, because it looks much worse than on our old fashioned CRT tube TV. While there is a fair amount of programming on HD, no St. Louis Cardinal games are broadcast on FOX Midwest, and there isn't as much HD programming as one would like. But I think most NFL games will be in HD on FOX, so I'm still glad I got the set. My biggest complaints are that the sound is softer on HD, so one has to readjust the sound when switching between an HD and analog channel. Secondly, when there is movement, ie. a baseball player running to first, white lines (like the baselines in baseball, tennis, etc.)don't look right if there is movement. When the movement stops, the lines look fine. Overall, there is a fabulous picture on HD, and I highly recommend the set."
2,Whatever,"This album is not an Elton John album. The other review on this page seems to think so. Instead, we get somebody playing the music of Elton John. This is not Elton playing. The music is fine. But, you know, you need Elton. As for horrible comments on this, I am speechless. He wrote one album for Disney. That does not showcase 32 years of his career. Billy Joel writes his own songs and so does Elton. Everybody knws that. He hasn't written the same song over and over again. That much is evident. This album isn't worth anybody's money. The review below isn't worth space on this page."
4,"valid but, somewhat outdated","i am giving this book four stars. it was written in 1976 which,was before manyof us became computer devotees-finding out lots of stuff on the computer, but some of the info in this book can STILL be used. suzanne hilton's book explains how to find your ancestors starting with talking to old people in the family. it continues with different tips:libraries,cemeteries,historical societies and the like. it is well written and interesting.i am curious why it is listed as,""reading level-baby-pre school""?!?!? it is forteens or adults. this book can help people who want to do this research,""hands-on"".get out your notebooks and pencils!"
4,Good sourcebook...,"This is a great sourcebook for inspiring GMs with ideas of how dragons behave. It even offers an article on each of the ""major"" dragon types (the chromatic and metallic dragons.) That having been said, I was a little disappointed that it didn't mention (not even in passing) any of the other kinds of dragons in the D&D setting."
4,"Very good purchase, though, less good condition.",Seller was extremely helpful and prudent. Book is amazing. Full of detail and wonder. Though mine was a little more scuffed than was described I am happy to now have this edition in my possession.
2,Great Big Book of Cheese,"Certainly every player can remember the time their character walked up and easily slew an elder dragon with only the Monster Manual rules in play. Wait, you can't? Neither can I...This book takes the most powerful creatures in D&D and raises the bar to, at times, laughable levels. Full of special ""Dragon Only"" feats, skills, prestige classes, and new dragons altogether, this book is a handy resource for any GM that wants to smash their party into dust with little or no creative effort.Imagine if you will, a dragon that can warp time so just when you think you killed it, surprise! You actually didn't... All this and more awaits you within these pages."
3,Watch it with the sound off...,"and be prepared to fast forward a lot. A naked Mimi Rogers directed by Nicolas Roeg sounded like an unbeatable combination, but their efforts are sabotaged by a terrible script. The two leads spend the entire film spouting pretentious banalities without any final payoff, neither erotic nor intellectual. This farrago gets three stars only for Rogers' nude scenes, although once her pale, voluptuous flesh is covered with massage oil, it unfortunately reminded me of a side of North Carolina barbecued pork!"
1,boring,After viewing this film I have no idea what the plot was about except a chance for Mimi Rogers to be naked throughout a film. She is actually quite hefty in this movie and I was surprised to see that. The film is about a middle-aged rich woman whose regular massage therapist sends in a replacement for himself. The entire film is them talking while the massage is going on with short flashbacks on events in both their lives. Very boring if you need more than skin to keep you interested in a film.
1,Edgar Winner???,"I am always looking for new authors and was drawn to this book because of its status as an Edgar Winner. As I was yawning into page 250, I was wondering exactly when this book was ever going to be interesting, or, in fact, if there was a plot. This book was a waste of time and money. What in the world were the Edgar Award people thinking."
5,Must Read,"After reading ""Line of Vision"" I was pleased to see that David Ellis has since written other books. He is an excellent author. This book is a legal thriller, written in the first person, that is always interesting and exciting. Although I did figure out some of the surprise ending, I didn't have it all figured out. It played out in such a fascinating way that it wouldn't have mattered if I had. I really couldn't put this book down and am thrilled to have a new author to follow."
5,angel medicine,i love doreen virtue and her products i love this cd just love it is just great to meditate to
5,A satisfying volume on a relatively obscure time in history,"I bought this book for my father, who is, among other things, an American history buff. I won't give a syopsis of the book, you can read that above. I will say he enjoys the book immensely, read the whole thing through, and refers to it regularly as needed. It was well worth the price I paid for it as a gift, and he and I were quite pleased. If you're considering buying this for someone who studies this period in American history, don't hesitate."
3,Insightful,"Although this book can feel long and dry at parts, it is a very insightful look into how the British Empire gained control of North America and then fumbled its governance. The Stamp Act riots and other events leading to the American Revolution look much different when viewed as an aftermath of the Seven Years' War, as this book portrays it, than as a beginning of the United States as other books portray it. This author does a fine job of showing the strengths and limitations of the American colonies under British rule, and even adds his own little ""what might have been"" scenario at the end of the story, which is quite interesting. Taken as a whole, there are more enjoyable books out there to read through, but this one holds information that no American history lover should be left without."
5,"Great read, great insights","I'm interested in history, but have tended towards the 1800s. Picked up this book for context on the 1700s, was very surprised by how much I learned. This book is not only very readable, but helped broaden my perspective of what influenced Indian and Colonial American thinking. What I liked best is that I don't think I will ever look at the American Revolution or George Washington quite the same way. I also appreciated the sophistication of the negotiation of the various Indian tribes and some insight into their thinking and politics."
2,"Too slow, but you could use it...","If you shoot RAW only, forget this thing. If you shoot RAW+JPEG and you configure it to only transfer the JPEG, then it could be a nice tool to show previews to customers."
2,Not what I expect from Nikon,"I have been a Nikon shooter (serious amateur and semi-pro) for 8 years. This is the first Nikon product I am returning. As a software engineer and networking specialist, I discounted the reviews saying this product was tough to set up. They were more than right: in 2 days of trying I could not get it to work with my network; a new experience for me.Also, the quality of the product hinges on 3cm of external USB wiring you do not see in the images. It gets in the way, cannot be replaced, and would break easily, in my opinion. Further, once attached you now have 2 power switches to remember to turn on!For me, this product is very sub-par. I could not make it work, and it does not measure up to the engineering quality I associate with Nikon products."
3,Durability and issue,"Pros: Great organizational productFun!InexpensiveExterior material is durable (no rips or busting seams)Cons:My only con is that it is made of cardboard - The outside is vinyl but under the vinyl it is made of cardboard and if you have kids you know what this means.Its bent out of shape, the lid barely fits on it anymore etc.My older child has kept his in good shape but the ones for my younger child have met the fate of the garbage can.Younger kids see 'box' and think 'stepping stool' or 'chair'Great for older kids though!"
2,HotWheels Race Track,"You get what you pay for in this toy. For the entry level excitment of slot car racing for my five year old, this this toy did the job. Although the excitement was short-lived for this toy, I was glad I paid under 20bucks. The batteries that you need, which i wasn't aware of until x-mas eve, cost me 3/4's of the price of this toy. The quality is very cheap. I broke two pieces of the track putting it together the first time. But, for the price and the age of my child it was worth it."
1,harmful item...terrible...I was looking forward to receiving it.,"terrible instructions. terrible glue; when it fell, wood crumbled into pieces. I took black dividers and having a fellow church member help build me one. I lost ALOT of $$$$ because this item is GARBAGE,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!I NEVER DOG AN ITEM BUT WHEN IT COLLAPSED IT HARMED ME TOO..."
1,What a waste.,"I was surprised at the ""hero"" of the book. He comes off as a heartless thug that enjoys killing people for no reason. In most of the books I read this guy would have been the villian. The book moves really slow, too. Lots of useless and long-winded explainations that add absoulutly nothing to the story. Reminds me of school when you had to write a story of 500 words or more. You came up with lots of useless stuff just to get the word count up."
4,Killer without a Cause,"In 'Rain Fall', Barry Eisler has managed to turn Van Wolferen's 'Enigma of Japanese Power' into a pretty tight thriller. Shades of Tom Clancy's John Clark in the lead role, with a cameo appearance by Coppola's Colonel Kurtz, but originality probably doesn't come too easily in this genre. Lots of technical stuff (judo holds, tour of Shibuya's bars and boutiques, the so-called 'iron triangle' of Japanese bureaucracy, business and politics, etc.) for those who like to feel they're learning something. You probably don't want to dwell too long on the tortured psychology, mystifying motivation and glib amorality of our hero, but this is a great wham-bam read. It's probably only the Great American Public's famous aversion to sub-titles, together with the lack of a suitable Japanese-American bilingual male lead, which keeps this off the silver screen."
3,Rain Fall didn't shower me,"Barry Eisler's 1st novel - Rain Fall - was a good read, but not a great read.According to all the hoopla reviews on this, I really thought this was going to be much better. Don't get me wrong, it is not bad. It had its merits. But all the over usage of hide and seek tactics got old for me after awhile.The main character is pretty engaging, however. The reviewers would have one think that this novel was going to read like a Quentin Tarantino film. But it didn't...at all.But it was good enough to where I'll probably check out the 2nd novel, just to see if the writer was just getting warmed up."
4,Actually 4 ++,"Strong character, great story and even learned something about the Japanese culture. Will definitely keep an eye open for the next installment."
3,Good book,"A very solid, well-paced book. The character of Rain is both interesting, and likeable (which is not quite what you'd expect from someone who is essentially a contract killer). Probably not going to change the world or anything, but I intend to read the rest of this series."
2,sorry pick,"this has got to be the sorriest of the dick's picks. the band was really off on this night. every song is just not there in my opinion. i bought this pick once, then sold it. i thought i would give it another try and bought it again. i sold it the next day again. the sound is also terrible on here. do yourself a favor and stay away from this one, it is just not up to par with any of the other picks. sorry, if i offended anyone that likes this, but to me it is awful. i have no problem with any of the other picks (with the exception of # 4)."
1,not what I expected,I thought I was ordering a book with punctuation refreshers but it was so complicated and not what I expected. Returned the book.
4,She Was a Real Pilot,"While most remember Ms. Oliver as a prolific actress who appeared on virtually every 1960's TV show, she discoverd flying as a young adult and it is obvious she had a talent for it. That is what attracted me to the book. As a pilot, I've read hundreds of books by pilots - certainly all the famous ones. Oliver's book fits right in. She was one of us - clearly at home in the sky but also very professional. I wish I knew more about her flying life after the Atlantic flight. I felt a real kinship with her."
4,Close to fiction,"In their earlier book ""Blur"" Davis and Meyer had blurred the difference between many things ( the difference between product and service for example ) . In this book the difference between fiction and reality gets blurred !The common thread that runs across all chapters is - Connectivity, Speed and Intangibles, and it is certainly advisable to read ""Blur"" before reading this book. I find it very difficult to visualize many events that are forecast in this book. The main effects of IT (Information Technology) in the new economy seem to be the phenomenal increase in the ratio between I (Intangibles) and T (Tangibles) ; the redistribution of wealth wherein the individuals manage their own risks; securitization of talent ; and virtually trade in everything thereby creating new markets and opportunities.A word of caution. Check your vision both before and after reading this book!"
3,over priced,"No manuals, over priced compared to others.Picture had a heatsink on the chip but the adapter I received did not."
5,Adaptec 1220SA,The board installed easily and worked well. No surprises or fights to get it operational.
1,Satisfied . . .,Throwing this phone against a concrete wall brought a level of satisfaction that normal use was never able to deliver. Stay away from this phone! Primary problem was with picking up a dial tone - it rarely did. It did have one benefit - it should be marketed as an exercise device. When a call comes in it will force you to run for the corded phone.
1,Returned immediately...,"I purchased this phone because of it's cost. From now on, cost will be not be the thing that I care most about. When I plugged the phone in the amount of noise was unbearable. Stay away....Stay far away."
2,Hello Hello Can You Hear Me?,"I bought this phone about 18 monthes ago and about a year ago it started acting funny. Every so often, I would place or answer a call and the person on the other end of the conversation couldn't hear me. I could hear them just fine. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the silence. I'm buying another phone today!"
1,Budgie....in name only!,"Little known Budgie, along with Black Sabbath were the godparents of heavy metal.In 1971 they debuted with a raw,pounding,bluesy style all their own.With each subsequent album they honed their heavy sound peaking in 1974 with ""In for the Kill"".1975's ""Bandolier"",and 1976's ""If I Were..."" found the band evolving with a more progressive [less heavy] sound.The transition was seamless and refreshing!1978's ""Impeckable"" wasn't quite up to par but still solid work.I had no idea that it was to be the last relevent work they would do.1980's ""Power Supply"" was metal [minus the heavy].Every track was vapid and non-descript...Budgie had lost it's sound and it's soul.The same can be said for all the ""Budgie"" I've heard since...It might be Budgie, but in name only!"
2,Not as eye poping as the jacket promises,"Smith takes a tautalogical thesis, and displays that business interests don't always dominate the political sphere. Alas, it would seem, that one of the reasons business is not sucessful in this country is that it has too little power vis a vis environmental regulation, labor law, etc. Even with Smith's data and analysis, this is only the case in one domain, where busisnesses are unified in interest and action. In these very few cases, public interest is much higher than the norm and thus oposition to business is much more likely. In Smith's other domains (which capture many more policy instances), public interest is so low, that corporations almost always get what they want...some kind of policy preference from the government. While the typology developed for this study can be applied across policy making units, it is even more likely that corporate interests succeed at the state and local level."
3,Interesting pictures,"A nice book where every page is a picture and a short summary. The book goes in a order from largest/farthest to smaller items. Its a good coffee table book, basically something to breeze through --once or twice."
2,The auto commentary of a controversial figure,"This book is an interesting read. If read on a superficial level, it gives a rather entertaining insight into the life of one of the first Western disciples of His Holiness 16th Gyalwa Karmapa. If the reader reads a bit deeper, the book sadly portrays a level of deception that casts a serious doubt on the authors motivation. In one chapter in particular, the author reproduces a letter written at the instigation of Ven.Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche in which he effectively bans the author from teaching at any of his centres - the most numerous of any Tibetan tradition in America at the time. The author amazingly launches into a diatribe of childish ridicule and dismissive abuse which sadly confirms the accusations cast in the letter itself. I found this most disappointing. On the whole, an entertaining read."
1,nauseous,"This smell is nauseous, i'm not sure what it is, it's simply too strong .My sister uses it and every time I am around her, I get a terrible headache."
3,It's alright,"This is a lighter tea with a strawberry scent. It's not horrible, but I didn't feel it was great either. The only thing I really like is that they don't have a string, since I brew tea in a kettle."
2,Really cute... but they don't fit my body type!,"These jeans are adorable, but they won't fit some body types. The legs are designed for women with medium-small thighs, and the hips are designed for medium-small hips. However, the waist of these jeans is designed for someone with a waist which is about the width of their hips (or a little less). If your waist is too small (like mine) then they tend to slowly sink down."
4,My Review,"Three young space travellers come across an escape pod, inside is a young girl, well not really a girl, a sort of half human half unicorn. These three young and enthusiastic young men raise this girl. They are miners and they find out that the young girl's race matures much faster than the human race does. The company they work for has been replaced by a new one and they lose her. When they get her back they flee from the place on there ship. One of the young men has a very rich and well, weird uncle. They decide to go to the uncle's hidden mansion and hide there for a while. There is just one slight problem, the uncle collects different items. The girl is one of them. I mean she has a horn on her forhead. See how this story ends. I would recomend this book to most anyone. If you don't read this, you are going to miss out. So take some time and read this book."
4,It was o.k.,"This book is an o.k. read. I guess I was expecting something greater because it is by Anne McCaffrey. I haven't read any of the other ones in this collection, they may be a little more exciting. I guess I was spoiled by the ""Pern Books"" so I was a little let down when I finished this book."
2,silly and soppy -- not a serious book,"I have to admit that I did not finish the book -- it was just too cutesy. As other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is more than just a little choppy. I would say it's just plain bad. And this surprises me, coming from Anne McCaffrey, since the few Dragon-series books that I read years ago were well-written (as I recall). In general, though, I would not recommend this book to SF and Fantasy readers. You can find much better."
4,A fun read,"Really fun to read, great characters, enough plot tension to keep me reading way past my bedtime, and a happy ending! I will be reading more books in the series."
5,Great,"I'm 14 and love Anne McCaffrey! I have read almost all the books in the Pern series, and some others. I have begun to have greatest respect for Anne McCaffrey and her books. I think that she is the best author I've ever read.I thought that Acorna was a very interesting and wonderful book. It kept my interest so well that I stayed up late to finish it. Anne lived up to and surpassed my high expectations with this book.While some people criticize Acorna for being one-dimensional, I believe the opposite. I believe that Anne is saying important things about God and how we react to him with it. It is more than a kid's book about unicorns, but the double meaning isn't thrown in your face either. Thank you Anne McCaffrey for another great book!Katherine Dare"
4,"Really Good Book, Really Odd Name","I picked up this book one day from my local library and truly enjoyed it. I was up nearly all night reading it (which did not help me in my college classes admittedly ;( half asleep) but it was to a fun cause. The book about a child name Acorna follows the myth of an abandonded child raised by those not of her kind to lead a life of greatness. Her 'adoptive' uncles provide vast amusement throughout the novel. This is not McCaffrey's best and the world reminds me a bit of her Pirates series with the dealing of slavery. I do admit that one big problem was the title, every time I passed the book in a store I said to myself, ""Acorn. . .a?"" and laughed :o. It makes some sense when you read the book, but can you imagine leaving with the a name like that? Good thing she didn't have to go to school, the teasing would be horrific. :p"
3,"Great premise, but greatly disappointing","This should have been a fabulous book. Ms. McCafferey knows how to write them. But, it should have been called ""Everybody Acorna Knows"" instead. Most of the book was spent describing the other characters, who were all ordinary people, instead of highlighting the vastly more interesting Acorna. She really had more of a bit part. Very sad.The Pern series went this way too. The first books were awesome, but the later ones droned on about the lives of everyone else except the dragons and their riders. Authors, please! We live with ordinary people every day. We read fantasy books for new experiences. Please concentrate on that!"
2,A Disappointment,"I found this book to be not quite up to the standards of Ms. McCaffrey's other books. I was sadly disappointed in Acorna's lack of any true character. She never really experienced true emotion throughout the whole series,. I know Ms. McCaffrey to be a wonderful writer, but I found this particular series lacking."
2,Insipid.,"So Anne McCaffrey started with books like Dragonflight-- death raining from the skies, passion, war, savage and cutting... and now we've got adorable baby blonde My Little Pony girls with teeny weenie cutesy unicorny horns prancing through space? What happened??? Don't get me wrong, I like unicorns just fine-- but I just can't stomach this much saccharine wankery."
2,"It wasn't horrible, but didn't quite cut it, I suggest....","I was dissapointed. Anne McCaffery usually had such exciting story and unraveling of an adventure. The characters were good, but I had the urge to stop reading the book half way through. I have not read any of Margaret Ball's work but I suggest that Anne McCaffery go back to writing by herself. I enjoyed her other books very much and suggest anyone who is thinking about buying this book to check out a book about Pern, for all of you who are already Pern-aholics I am sorry to say you will not find such excitment here."
1,Disappointing,"I am sorry to say, but this is one of the weakest McCaffrey books I have read. Most of the plot is conveyed via clumsy dialogue, and the plot seems to be jerked around in a way that is contrived and too coincidental to be believable, even for fantasy. The ending is just as flimsy, and left me asking ""¿that's it?"" If you would like to read a good McCaffrey book, look to the Crystal Singer series or the Dragon series. If you see this one on the shelf at the bookstore, leave it there."
1,"For two years, i had this movie up my ass.","Overall this movie was terrible, but the christopher walken impression in the diner made my day.i would say dont waste your time seeing this movie, but god, that one impression is so good. so good."
3,dirty book,"the book was written in permanent marker, had food stains, and the cover was sticky & dirty! I was very dissatisfied!"
4,Course book,This was an excellent deal for the book. The book had water damage but it was still readable. I received the book in a reasonable time frame. Thanks
3,"slow, yet tempting","oK, it was SLOWWWWW....it took about half the book before he actually got into his magic and almost 4/5 of the book before it got ""exciting""...i.e. he did something with his magic. I wasn't overly impressed with character development as the main character felt very flat. I kinda want to see what happens next but I'm not going to get upset if I don't. At least it's fairly well written. Not painful in the grammatical sense or sentence structure etc. I think if that had been bad, I would not have read the whole thing."
1,Don't waste your money,Most of the music on this CD was awful. There were a couple songs that were okay. The theme to Independence Day was good. Mission Impossible was terrible. It's quality was very poor. Think twice before purchasing this one.
2,Norway - Land of Enchantment,"Purchased this DVD for my 84 year old mother - a Norwegian who has never been to Norway. I had hoped it would give her a nice overview of what you can see in Norway. That was not the focus. Beautiful music and scenery, but I was looking for more scenery, cities, sites, etc. that a tourist would go to see."
1,Are the System Requirements A Secret ?,"I have been searching for the system requirements for this title for some time but without sucess. I have e-mailed JoWood's support link requesting this information. That was a good ten days ago(from 2/28) and to date, no response.JoWood's web site contains interesting screen shots from this program but does not answer the basic consumer question of ""Will this program run on my computer"" ? wouldn't you want to know this before purchase ?Given the lack of responsive from JoWood Support and given the fact that system requirements are not available, I would advisea big negative on this one.What a shame ! Finally an original title for serious wargamers like myself, and its market is being killed by unresponsiveness, indifference, stupidity, all of the above, none of the above, but by a production oversightThus my * (one) stars rating because it could have been a rising star."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I love the concept of this toy. My son enjoys playing with it but sometimes the screws stick and he cannot unscrew them. Overall, we are satisfied with the toy."
2,TMI,Too much information the disc is loaded not that is good and bad good for it includes variety bad because it is just that tmi.
3,Dabomb,Everything is alright now is one of the best songs on this cd. It has a nice beat and a nice rythmn. It also has a good melody to it.
2,"Nice light, but just stopped working","Seemed like a nice item and it worked fine for a short time, then suddenly died. Not reliable."
2,Disappointing Product,"The LEDS are very bright and otherwise an excellent flashlight. Upon receipt of the flashlight, I noticed the on/off button was very sticky. After approximately six uses the button stuck in the ON position and will not release. I have to remove and re-insert the batteries to use it now."
4,Improved an already good product,I have had the Streamlight 4AA LED Flashlight for over a year and bought two more. Tne new flashlight have a brighter and stronger light that my first. It is an excellent product.
5,Ultimate flashlighr,"This is my second Streamlight (I left the last one in a motel). It is simply the best (and last) flashlight. It is very rugged, bright & comfortable. It is just the right size & weight, and BRIGHT! It takes 2 AA batteries that last a long time & with 7 very bright LEDs should last nearly forever."
1,What with all the hype about led flash lights.,"Unless something is wrong with the one I bought from Costco, I am keeping my old one. I turned it on the fist time in my garage and thought to myself this couldn't be right, not from what I read about and expected. I checked to see if all the 7 leds are working and they seemed to be ok. I turned off the garage lights to to see how it work in the dark but was still surprised how dim it was. I compared my old traditional Ryovac with this light and the $8 Rayovac beat it by far in brighness, close up or from a distance, eventhough the leds produced whiter light. May be people bought these lights for the long hours of use and may be it needs a break-in period? Luckily I bought it from Costco and was able to return."
1,HORRIBLE,They sent me the wrong product. Then I sent a return and they said they don't have it. Now I don't have one.
5,Sweet,"Bigger than I expected, this little duckling sits on my nightstand. Creamy white with few details, yet the shape is natural and the little face is winsome."
4,Terrific With Some Surprises,"This three Disc set from May 1981 (Nassau Coliseum)contains the usual healthy handful (over three hours of inspired, often improvised moments) of music by this great band (consisting at the time of Garcia, Hart, Kreutzmann, Lesh, Weir, and Mydland).Disc One is a fairly laid back affair, but is smooth throughout. Disc Two picks up the pace a little (there is a very bluesy feel throughout this set) and concludes with an unlisted, rollicking 30+ minute performance of ""Scarlet Begonias/Fire on the Mountain"" which will prepare you for the fireworks on Disc Three. As is typical with the Dick's Picks discs, the energy continues to build and the band's last performance of ""Caution"" and ""Spanish Jam"" is truly something to hear. The disc closes with the oft-played ""Good Lovin'"" and a nice, restrained ""Don't Ease Me In"" closes a fine collection.A terrific performance from the somewhat inconsistent 80s and well worth purchasing. It's good! HHD."
2,"Burns bright, burns easily, burns your hand","I've been using this bulb as an exact replacement for my desk lamp for years. It shines bright and has that traditional incandescent/tungsten color. But this bulb will also triple burn you. First, it gets super hot. I can't even touch the lamp if its been on for awhile without scolding my hand, let alone the bulb itself. Second, it burns easily. The filament is ultra hot/bright and doesn't seem to be the more durable 130volt version. As a result, any spikes in your power grid will burn out the filament. Third, the price is cheaper in places like Walmart. Way cheaper. Ouch."
3,Mixed feelings,"This work out was pretty good, but I couldn't stop laughing at these two women with their fake boobs, fake hair and lipo. I mean, come on now, if you are going to sell a product, at least make it look like you USED the product to get those bodies, girls!LOL!!!"
5,Splendor of God,"I received this book as a Christmas gift from my mother-in-law. I had just returned from a mission trip to Thailand and had a special interest in the work of Adoniram and his wife ""Nancy"" as he so lovingly called her. I found their commitment and drive fascinating. I think you'll find this to be one of those books that keeps coming to mind over many years. The story dug a place in my soul."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK ABOUT MOST MISUNDERSTOOD CREATURE,"I found GREAT WHITE SHARK by RICHARD ELLIS to be one of the best books about GREAT WHITES ever written. I can see why STEVE ALTEN the author of MEG recommendeds it. It talks about the GREAT WHITE'S hunting instincts, swimming instincts and breeding instincts with more information about GREAT WHITE'S, like no other book before it. I admit that when I started reading it I thought I would be bored with it quickly, how wrong I was. The book was fascinating and informative, I felt that the author had really done a lot of research about GREAT WHITE SHARKS before writing it. He even goes into the remote possibility of the GREAT WHITE SHARK'S ancestor. The CHARCHRADON MEGLADON""S existence in the modern era. I felt he also researched those sharks greatly as well. All in all this book gives you a greater appreciation of these maginificent creatures and the importance of thier continued survival. If you love sharks this book is definitley a must read."
3,Over-rated 77-78 Dead,"I saw more than 200 Dead shows from 1977 to 1995, and I plainly don't like the 1977 and winter 1978 Dead recordings; I find these to be among the most overrated by my fellow fans, though the headbanging appeal is obvious -- they rocked hard on the surface. On these discs, Garcia's sour-milk guitar tone is awful to listen to, at times unbearable, and the rest of the band is on auto pilot. I think the Dead got progressively more spacy into late 1978 and 1979 and by 1980 things were just ducky in my opinion (except for Jer's shot voice). For a truly hot Scarlet>>Fire, go with the Hartford 1983 DP, the heat is genuine, relentless, and much more rewarding. And the post-Drums is a winner."
4,At the peak of their carrer,"This is the first Dead CD I bought, and it is awesome. Jerry's guitar work on this is spectacular, and the rest of the band holds together beautifully. Many people have called the 1972-1979 period the best Dead ever, and this really shows it."
1,book of love,"om sorry to tell you this, i bought this movie, one time before, new i paid almost 50 dlrs, i wasn't satisfied, i return it. i bought it again, same thing, it was scratch, and it was new, i dint want to go, to the same trouble again, so i keep it, im not a satisfied customer."
1,MOVIE?,"THIS IS NOT A MOVIE, IT'S A SAD DOCUMENTARY OF MEN MAKING FUN OF WOMEN. STARS ARE IN THIS TOO BOOST SALE, BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVE. WORST EVER! WASTED MY MONEY!"
4,TRADITIONAL rack,"No, it does not have mounting arms for a mountain bike or a dedicated touring bike like a Surly Long Haul Trucker. It is not specifically intended for carrying panniers on a tour. But if you want what a pletscher rack was in the 60s and 70s -a good way to carry a small basket on your road bike- this is it. It is intended to attach to stay eyelets and the seatstay bridge. The universal mounting hardware is for mounting to the brake pivot bolt of a rear caliper brake on newer bikes (80s-90s) without a suitable seatstay bridge. I am sure that the seller assumed that most people would know what a pletscher rack is and how to mount one. This rack is for a traditional road bike, not a mountain bike."
5,sublime indeed,"If you love cake, if you love chocolate, if you love to bake, this book is one you cannot do without. It is the best dessert book I have read in years. Urvater is a superb writer, whose recipes are clear and always work. Her obvious love for her subject comes through in every recipe I have tried. I did not try the coconut cake because I don't like coconut, but Potato Chocolate Chip Cake, Yeasted Chocolate Cake, Autumn Chestnut Cake, to take just three, are divine. Her chapters on frostings and decorating are excellent and easy to follow. I come from a long line of chocolate cake lovers, and I have to say, this book really went straight to my heart. I will use it gratefully and sinfully for years to come."
4,Great Book Overall-Especially for teenage suspense lovers,"I read this book in junior high and really enjoyed it. Six wealthy but incorrigible teenagers are sent to what they think is summer camp, but in all actuality their parents have sent them there to be killed. Group six realizes this and has to find a way to get away from their ""camp counselors'"" and stay alive. The book becomes slow at one point but does quickly pick back up. A great overlooked gem."
2,web camera,"This camera did not provide smooth, quality video. I ended up purchasing a different camera, that did what I needed."
3,It's good,"If there is one definate thing about this CD,it is that it thumps. The beats are big, andthe melodies driving. This is a dancefloorfriendly album, so expect to hear lack ofcreativity in the vein of danceability, butdon't turn away there. The CD has much tooffer, including great production quality,and listenability. You can put headphoneson and enjoy this CD too. It's energetic andnu skool, with hard electronic skitteringbreaks and electro grumble. Some kind ofindustrial tone sneaks in there too, wherevocal tracks don't necessarily follow thenormal ""dance"" routine, lending to theoverall feel of a production album ratherthan a track compilation or mix. This isgood, and if you put this CD on, prepareto be awake. Maybe a little uncreative attimes, and possibly a little trite atothers, but definately a quality production."
3,"It's OK, but has some problems","I've had this board for several years and have run into a couple of problems.1. The ""Cyber Match"" feature (where you play against the computer in the board) has a glitch that allows the computer to throw a triple bullseye.2. The ""Cyber Match"" feature seems to throw an inordinate number of triples, even at the weakest level. It also has hitting the double bullseye down pat at this level. I believe it hits the double bull more frequently than the single bull, even though the single bull is easier to hit, in theory, because it has a larger target area.3. The Power switch is flakey. You can turn it off, and the display goes blank, but it still drains the batteries in a couple of days. Maybe it turns back on when I'm not looking - I don't know. I've learned to pull out one of the batteries whenever I finish playing.I'm just a casual dart thrower, and I still enjoy playing Cyber Matches on this board, but it can be aggravating when the Cyber Match hits a triple bull."
1,Beware of good deals,"I used this pan for the first time and the rubber washers that separate the glass from the metal popped out. I was just making rice, nothing too complicated and this pan did not make it."
4,shearmur in fine form,"Although not as romantic as his earlier ""wings of a dove"" simply because of the genre, shearmur's energetic score shares more adrenilin with debney's ""cutthroat island"" than any of his other works. It features some gentle choral writing and a touch of ""celtic sound' (for reasons unknown) that will have any music lover getting out their ""air violin"". Overall this is a wonderful lush, sweeping and pleasently varied listen with many different sounds to enjoy, from the dark to the romantic, with lashings of adventure. Enjoyable simply as a piece of music too, because I haven't seen the film! Enjoy."
1,ONE ONE (JUNK),"they look nice when you first take them out of the box, but it raind one time and got all fogged up and moisture inside of them, never buy cheap lights again"
4,Get it free for your Kindle. You won't be disappointed,"It was free and I figured I had nothing to lose. I was right. Turns out the book is really good. It's a good story, entertaining and holds you captive. My only disappointment of the book is the character names and the names of locations. Figuring out how to pronounce them is annoying and I think takes away from really getting wrapped up in the story. If you can get past that, you're in for a good book!"
5,What a great read!,"I don't normally read fantasy novels, but the cover of this one caught my eye. The story was exciting and created a fascinating world. I don't know what book the other reviewer was reading, but it's hard to believe it is the same one!"
5,I had no idea,"Before I started reading, all I knew about this book was that it was written by Stackpole and I had read the one line description. The book starts out great and, though it quickly gets really weird (for someone who has no idea what is coming), it's very enjoyable. I particularly like the setting and probably would have read an entire book just on that. I loved that the one really predictable event in the book had a very unpredictable conclusion."
4,Another page turner from Broward's Rock,"I am finding this series is steadily improving as I go along. This was an excellent book. In it we have Max and Annie staying in a hotel Chastain while they are trying to find a young client of Max's who has gone missing. In their search they are are drawn into some monumental family squabbles that include two main important families in Chastain. They find they are also trying to solve a 22 year-old murder suicide, since it appears that this is what is behind the young girl's disappearance. The book kept me guessing most of the way through, but I couldn't seem to put it down. Visitations and ghost sitings helped make things interesting."
2,Uninteresting and weak,The style did not appeal to me the way she injected useless information and in doind so breaking dialouge into segments. This weakened the dialouge and the flow of the book. The ending seemed unimaginative after the creative beginning. I had high expectations for this book but the book fell far short.
5,"Historical, colorful, informative, and fun to read!!!","Interesting to find that this is the first book of its kind on the history of condoms and their packaging. Not only does it contain information the average person would never have guessed, it is useful to those into the history of graphic design. The tins are miniatue works of art in themselves, regardless of what they contained! The down to earth style of the text is easy on the reader as well. All in all a great bargain - the hardcover of the book in itself is worth the price of admission!"
3,It's a descent start.,"I may be a little harsh on the rating but I think the book has a descent starting foundation for the beginner. I have this problem of only reading to page 150 of any ""how to"" book and I found myself doing the same with this one. However, I have come back to this book repeatedly for answers and modeling help. Mind you this is not reference book so much as it's a tutorial as the final tutorial helps has you draw the books cover. I did find that this book gave me a descent foundation to where I knew enogh to experiment on my own, which in my opinion is one of the best ways to learn."
3,Last Rights,"I like the book very much. Kiernan has obviously researched his subject well and write about it in an engaging way. This is an important topic and everybody in America should be familiar with these concepts.I very much object to all the errors in the Kindle edition, which occur on every single page. Misspellings and bad formatting abound. I find this unforgiveable and very distracting. And I have found lots of errors in every Kindle version of a book I have purchased, but this one is the worst."
4,Quite A Find,"Great percussion and great to listen to Andrea once again, as I have really enjoyed her art in the Charanga 76 albums. African Flower and My Little Swede Shoes are some of my favorites. Includes Hilton Ruiz on piano, and Steve Turre in several numbers, great percussion, and a bass that is very accentuated in several numbers. A very good latin jazz album, and very rhythmically varied. A charming recording, that will keep the listener in a really cheerful, jubilant, party mood."
5,Essential,"It is difficult to come to grips properly with US foreign policy in the 20th century without at least considering the thesis that Mahl presents: this book is essential reading for historians, political scientists and international relations scholars."
5,A history of the Eucharist through art,"This book depicts the history of sacrifice to God through works of art. It starts in the Old Testament sacrafice of the Levitical priests through the sacrifice of Jesus and the Mass. It includes images of paintings and artifacts demonstrating how sacrifice was performed, the importance of it and how it has transformed into the Eucharist. Along with the pictures, there are Biblical references giving a well-articulated apologetical explanation of the sacrifice of the Mass. A beautiful book."
5,Awesome general overview of medieval warfare.,"This is really one of the best general books on medieval warfare I have seen. It has two great advantages:First, it covers the overall strategies of campaigns throughout the ages, with insight into motivations, logistics, tactics, and the like. Few major wars are ignored, and the level of depth pursued is great enough for all but the foremost researchers on the topic.Second, the book has awesome illustrations representing both overall campaign strategies and the tactics utilized in individual battles. Combined with the detailed descriptions, this has offered me the most insight into how medieval battles were carried out and won.I highly recommend this book to anyone at all interested in medieval warfare."
5,"Creepy, in a sleepless night way.","The Devils of D-DayFirst off, I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers. I first read this Masterton book back in 1981 and have not read it since, lost it somewhere along the way. It still gives me the, ""willies"", when I think about it. A first class, religious, good vs. evil story told very well. As the book has been out for about 30 years, I think that I can safely quote a line from it that still gives me chills and hopefully not spoil it for someone.Question: ""You're not Father Anton! Where's Father Anton? What have you done with Father Anton?"".Answer: ""You're almost standing in him"".Again, I have not read the book in nearly 30 years and that part still gives me chills. I may not have it exactly correct but I'm sure that the imagery has been conveyed. A truly enjoyably, frightful book, and that's a good thing.First class and highly recommended, if your into sleepless night horrors!Spence the Elder""Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc""-M. Addams-"
5,fantastic,we have only had the book less then 2 weeks and have tried about 4 things and all have been easy to make and delicious
2,Sound quality is poor,"I was very surprised by the low sound quality of these discs. I have bootleg tapes from this period that sound cleaner and more up front. If this disc had better sound I would have given it 3 stars.As has already been mentioned, the best part of this set is the filler at the end. ""Eyes"" is long and well jammed. And the ""Samson"" is one of the best I've ever heard. These two songs almost make up for an otherwise disapointing Dicks Picks."
2,Not So Great,"I'm not especially familiar with 90's-era Dead yet. I know that were occasionally more impressive than this though.This is the sound of a band in decline. Garcia sounds like a junkie being carried. Welnick sounds like he thinks he is in another band. The rest of them continue to do their thing, more or less the same thing they had been doing for decades. This is a disappointment."
5,True Blueberry herbal tea,"B""HA while back, Celestial Seasonings discontinued my favorite tea, Strawberry Kiwi. Since I drink mostly Celestial Seasonings iced herbal teas (which I make with stevia since I'm diabetic and holistic) I didn't know what to do but I found two flavors that work very well together -- True Blueberry and Moroccan Pomegranate Red. I used two bags of each, sweetened to taste, in each half gallon of water."
5,WHAT A FIND! This book is wonderful. I loved it!,"LONG AFTER WE ARE GONE, THIS WORK WILL BE READ AND PASSED ON TO PEOPLE WHO VALUE TENDERNESS AND THE BEAUTY OF BEING ALIVE. WITH ITS COMPANION VOLUME, ALL THE WAY HOME, MY LIBRARY HAS BEEN DEEPLY ENRICHED BY EXPERIENCING THE WORK OF THIS CARING AND PERCEPTIVE ARTIST AND AUTHOR."
1,Disappointing,"The pot is heavy, and despite the advertised ""stay-cool handles"" the handles of the lid and saucepan get hot. The handle is also uncomfortable to grip."
1,James Holan,Mr. Holan is NOT an approved instructor in the American Style Nunchaku-He is not ranked in the style--Mike
4,love and hate it,"I have read alot of this series. I love it. Rachel morgan is a great character. Not gonna lie i read the book more for ivy. Hot and complex. Yumm. So really good book, my favorite one so far. I just reallly wish rachel was more open minded. Lol. Thats just me."
4,Decent,"This series is pretty good, for the most part. They get a little wordy and take aWhile to get to the point. I do enjoy these books though"
2,So Sad,"I only mildly enjoyed book 1, but I saw potential, so I went ahead and purchased books 2 & 3. They were by far much better books and I was excited to read the 4th. Unfortunately, it was a very sorry addition to the series. None of the characters do any growing and the only real plot development is the addition of werewolves into the mix, which does nothing to improve the story. It just bogs down an already complicated story line started in the first three books. For some reason we leave all of the interesting side characters behind for these flat underdeveloped weres. I'm sorry but it turned Rachel into a poorman's Anita Blake. Hopefully, book 5 will get back on track, but I'm waiting for the reviews before purchasing."
3,"Good, if you like road movies","Like a lot of reviewers, I hope Ms. Armstrng goes back with the Hollows as the scene for her next installment. I liked the world she created there, and wasn't thrilled with the change of scene in this book. It kind of felt like a TV show that's running out of ideas and wants to change the local for an episode or two to renew interest. I think there's plenty left to say about the Hollows, and hope she goes back there soon."
3,bad book binding,"Unrelated to the actual content of the book, I've discovered that there is weak binding for my copy of this book. Pages have fallen out, and I am actually left with a chunk of paper with no cover."
5,I got the job!,"Yes, I read the book and got the job, coincidence? Not. I have been looking for work in my industry for three years. I got what I wanted as far as salary as well. And, yes they did ask me what my favorite movie was and I was prepared. Highly recommend this book."
1,Completely Inadequate,"This book doesn't even come close to covering the information on the exam. I relied on information from my instructor, class notes and Transcender exams to pass."
2,GARBAGE,"After a friend had studied this book, he advised me not to buy it, and to try some other. As I had purchased the 5 previous MOC books and passed all the exams, I wanted to see for myself how this book compared. Take my advice now and find some other book to study for the exam. This one is a big let down, confusing and a complete waste of time and money, and that's a fact."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a Halex dartboard & had many of the same problems that others have. We used steel tip darts and after a few months of playing every other weekend or so, the dart board began to fall apart! The metal dividers fell off & the darts wouldn't stick. When you pull out a dart, part of the board comes with it. Very poor construction! I would suggest using plastic darts instead, but they don't stick, resulting in 2/3 of your darts not sticking to the board! I would not recommend this product or any product made with ""Halex""."
2,Out of date and confusing.,"This book is not worth the time invested in reading it. It is out of date and confusing. I was mainly interested in knowing about Bin Laden but not much was said about him. Fortunately I just found the September 2001 edition of ""Bin Laden by Bin Laden - In His Own Words"" by Kirk Fianzcanna which prooves to be the definitive ressource on the most wanted man."
5,Sm,We bought this desk for our 9 year old daughter (she picked it out). It is a very sturdy desk and very easy to put together. We have been very impressed with it.
1,How Do I Leave???,"Okay...of course it is up to personal taste..but Trisha Yearwood's version of this song is the definitive version.Rimes can't even seem to pronounce the title properly, it sounds alot like she is singing ""How Do I LEAVE"" Instead of ""LIVE"" She has a very unpleasant melody in her voice, and I actually don't mind some of her other work, but not for this song.I was so surprised to hear that this version actually outsold Trisha's..becasue by word of mouth and radio play All I ever heard was Trisha's..not to mention of couse it was put to the blockbuster Con Air."
2,The Book Soldier Five,"The book stated when I ordered it that it was in very good condition and it was not. The book itself is all stained and pages are marked and it is also torn in places. So whilst the book was a good price, I was not happy with the condition of it. The other one I ordered The Real Bravo Two Zero was in great condition though."
4,Blue Chart,The final product is great. However getting the info from the CD to my GPS was not the easiest thing in the world. Instructions are incomplete and the process of hiliting the maps you want is difficult at best.
1,OLD SOFTWARE!! Instead FIND - USE Version 7 as of (06/15/05),"I cannot believe that anyone would ethically sell outdated charts. Avoid unless you find the latest version available. Storms and tides change the oceans, and new wrecks and hazards may be present.AVOID!!! Version 5.5Update 5/14/06: Do not believe reviewers that tell you to keep old charts or old software versions. For your own safety, insurance, and liability reasons you need the latest charts. There may be an obstruction or security zones added. It is the responsibility and requirement by the coast guard that each boat owner have current charts. Notice to mariners and other updates as well... I can tell you that in the coastal waters in Florida sometimes the Hurricanes cause bottom contour changes that could render you aground... Be safe!"
5,Whoa!,"Over 20 years of reviewing Albums/CD's and making recommendations to my fellow freinds. I had never anticipated this particular Cd would rate so high in my review. Based on the overall track quality and how the Cd is put together, Louise Nurding's debut CD as a solo artist recorded the highest ranking EVER.This is one of those rare ""complete"" CD where no ""filler tracks"" can be found between the first track to the last. Boys and Girls, there are only handful of CD/Albums ever produced that is this good."
2,"yeah, but can you clean it?","What can you say about a bed pan, right? Well, one thing that is not apparent from the photos is that the pan extends underneath the lip of the shallow end of the pan. I haven't used it yet, but imagine that if you get some you-know-what under that lip, cleaning will not be so easy."
3,Good Cookbook for Americans,"Several other Latin American cookbooks have recommended this cookbook and I found this book very good in terms of the recipes.However, I found it very frustrating to use as I am a modern, young European who has no knowledge about 'cups'. The units of cooking in this book are totally in American and there is no translation at the start to assist in converting to grammes or mililitres or to notify people about the differences between American and UK pints.Thankfully, I am a qualified chef so I was able to translate the differences but it made it a hard book to use.As stated above the actual recipes are very good. If only it were more user-friendly."
1,A poor effort,"I was most disappointed with this guide. The restaurant details are all out of date, the spelling of Hungarian words is totally wrong and the addresses are mis-spelt and incorrect. It appears that author John Hayes never even went to Hungary. As a Hungarian I find the lack of care and attention very offensive."
5,WHACK!,"Yo all, American Idol is da bomb and so is dis CD...true dat! But Joshua Gracin is whack...and there aint no duck in here!"
1,WORSE CD EVER,This cd is so terrible it's not even worth me putting it into words. Save your money and buy Justin Guarini instead.
3,"Good voices, terrible music","There are some great singers on AI2 (Ruben, Kimberly, Clay, Rickey) and some bad (Carmen, Josh), but nothing on this CD is as bad as the bland studio music backing these tracks. Some potentially great songs are dulled by it, and the mediocre (carmen) are turned into miserable. The only sing that really rises above its music is, surprisingly, Julia DaMato's ""At Last,"" which is well-sung and even well-played."
4,American Idol 2 CD Review -- Some Surprises,"I was impressed with most of this CD. By far, I think the biggest surprise was Julia DeMato. Her version of At Last was excellent. If she had sung like that all the time, she'd still be on that stage. Trenyce's version of Let's Stay Together is one of the best of the track. It was a mistake to vote her off. While I don't think she would've won, she was one of the top three vocalists on the show and proves it with this version. Also loved Clay. He has a true recording voice....What the World Needs Now...great version."
4,Good case - doesn't flip open,"It's a good case/ pocket with great attachment features. Not sure why it's listed as a case for flip phones because it doesn't flip open? It certainly is easy to find loose in my purse and it does protect my phone but heavy enough I won't use it FT if the purse has a cell phone pocket, as most are starting to. And again, if you want to flip open your phone you have to extract it from the pouch and then flip open your phone. Hence not a flip case which is why it only got ****. Also the case is MUCH darker than shown. Think dark denim & red. Still can't beat the price or the multitude of ways to carry it! Great for outdoors"
1,A failed experiment,"This book has a great Steranko cover, but it's all downhill after that. It makes a good argument that Chandler's verbose writing and tangled mysteries are better in their original form than as graphic adaptations. The images here do little to clarify the stories, and in some sequences make the narrative more confusing. I had to read some pages several times to comprehend what was going on. If you want noir comics, read the Sin City series by Frank Miller. If you want Raymond Chandler, read the originals. But pass on this one."
4,Clamps,"Ok There is not enough clamps to do any good. Should be at least (4) of each for money, price to high."
5,Honeywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fan,"This is a great product.Cools on one side, exhaust on the other. The room where this fan was placed needed ventilation (room size 12x14) and this fan did the trick extremely well. It really made a big noticeable, comfortable difference in the room.The unit gives options for speed control and the noise level is hardly noticeable.I would buy this product again without question."
1,quality,The motor is so loud the plastic parts look very cheap. I suspect it did not pass the quality inspection. I cannot believe Honeywell has such low quality products.
4,"Not bad for the price,...does offer adjustable direction screens","This is an inexpensive unit, but does cool down a room in no time. It is fairly quiet on the lower settings and is nicely made. You can't go wrong with this investment. It comes with a window guard that you can screw into the side of the window frame but this does little to help the unit really. It does allow it to be locked in better if the winds were to kick up. But not really necessary. Id buy another and recommend it to friends and family."
3,NOISY!,"Had to hook the fan to a voltage reducer to get the noise level down to a tolerable level, even on Low Speed."
2,It's TOO loud.,"I've had a Bionaire window fan for more than a year and loved it and decided to buy one more window fan. Since this Honeywell fan got far better reviews than the bionaire fan, I decided to go with Honeywell instead of bionaire. That was a mistake. This is way too loud. Even with the low speed setting, i have to turn up the volume really high to watch TV. It's that loud. If you want to use it for your bedroom, I don't think it's possible. If you want to just relax with fresh air blowing in, I don't think it's possible, either. Also, with the fresh air mode, which's supposed to get fresh air from outside, I don't think it works well. I'm really disappointed at my choice this time."
2,Worked fine for 5 weeks :-(,Great little fan. I like the ability to blow air in via one fan and out with the other. After five weeks one of the fans died. After shipping it'll cost half of what I already paid for the fan using the 5 year warrenty.PS I've been on the phone for 30min while I write this trying to get a return authorization. Now they tell me that the office is closed? Boooo!
3,Too Loud,"Bought two. One for home, one for work. I just turned on the work one. It's too loud. I can't answer phones over that. I'm disappointed in how loud it is, even on the low setting. I expected the noise level to be about the same as every other window fan I've owned. They aren't. I would have returned these for a quieter model if I have kept the boxes and tried them when they arrived a month ago. The second one was for the bedroom. No way I could sleep though this."
2,I think i had a bad luck,I purchased this product for our kitchen window. I chose this fan because there was more than 100 good reviews for this product. One of the fans does not work after using couple of days. I think I had a bad luck on this. I beleive more than 100 good reviews cant be wrong.
2,Honeywell Thermostat not functioning But Amazon was Great!,"I bought this item thinking Honeywell is the leader in thermostatic switches and I've got to switch my opinion. I was counting on the Thermostat to be more than an on off switch I wanted it to be more sensitive. It needs to operate within a one degree range to be considered up to date in my book but it is well beyond 15 degrees so does not function the way I expected. reminds me of those old fashioned heater controls in cars, a smidgen this way and it's way to hot, a smidgen the other way and you freeze. This is 1950's technology & much less than I expected from Honeywell. I would now consider an upgrade to one of the digital models, any suggestions to replace myHoneywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fan"
2,Incredibly weak,"The only good thing about it is that it's quiet. That's in large part why I bought it.The high velocity fans tend to be deafeningly loud.But with this one, even at the ""super"" setting and sitting directly in front of it, you barely feel any breeze at all."
2,Window Fan,There was no way of securing this window fan in the window frame so that you could close the window behind the fan for security reasons or during inclement weather I have never owned a window fan that had to be removed in order to secure the window. There was no mention of this fact in Amazons's description of this product therefore it cost me shipping to send it back.
5,Works Great,"Awesome fan, i use one in my bedroom almost year round due to the large amount of electronic and computer equipment."
4,Moves alot of air,"There seems to always be an area of a house that holds stale air, & for me it's the Kitchen. I bought this fan for that room, to pull out the stale air in the mornings & draw in the cool outside air in the evening. Is this the quietest fan ? No, I wish it made less noise, but unless one uses the highest setting that's a willing tradeoff for what it does."
4,Enjoy an artificial breeze,"This is a great twin window fan for the price. What I like best about this fan is that it has a lot of options and is compact and fits in my 1930s designed window frames. It has three speed settings: super, medium, and low for each fan and a two-prong plug. It also has ""exhaust"" and ""fresh air"" settings for each fan. This is nice when you want to pull air in from the outside or expel air from the inside.The air flow is great and you can adjust it to your liking by turning one of the fans off or adjusting the speed settings.The one aspect that I do not like are the extenders on the sides of the fan. They're awkward to adjust and break easily or come off the tracks easily. Tip: hold down the levers on the bottom as you pull out the extenders."
2,No Vertical Hold,"I have had 2 Honeywell window fans, and in the past I have been very pleased. I had been able to insert them vertically, and the wings have stayed in position to hold the fan. This product arrived with a window bracket that needs to be screwed into a wooden window frame. The wings collapse if used alone, and will not hold the fan. I called Honeywell to tell them that I have a METAL window frame, and that the bracket won't work. They told me this model is discontinued, and there is nothing they can do."
3,"Works fine, but it's definitely not quiet","A window fan is a good way to circulate air and help keep the room cool at a low cost. Although this unit does work and is well built for the cost, by no means can this unit be called quiet.At the lowest setting, it has a very audible whine which is high pitched enough to prevent me from sleeping or watching TV at night. The speed settings are all far too high.It is powerful and gets the job done, but for me, it's worthless."
4,Great value for the money,"Easy to move around, well constructed, and I love the ability to switch from exhaust to fresh air, or both. Perfectly acceptable noise level at the low setting, and the high setting on exhaust clears stale air out of the room very quickly. The thermostat function also seems to work really well."
5,Great Little Giants,"These little fans are great for their size. Yes, they are on the louder side, but that is to be expected for the amount of air they can move. IF you want, ""the little fans that could,"" these are the fans for you!"
2,Barely Readable.,This book is the transcript of a large number of dialogues between Krishnamurti and Bohm. You could say they discuss abstract philosophical issues. You could also say they are babble like they are stoned and forgot what they were talking about. That's the way it seemed to me.
4,Singer Name on Duet Daddy's Little Girl/Butterfly Kisses,"The name of the singer on the cd butterfly kisses who sings the song ""Daddy's Little Girl"" is Kippi Brannon. I was also curious on this, and just did a little ""googling""."
3,Furthermore,"Jeff Carson definitely didn't write Butterfly Kisses. Furthermore, he was already well established as a singer with his earlier release ""Real Life"", which had three songs on it that received heavy radio play."
1,Horribly mis-matched and I didn't like either one,"I bought these intending them to be a gift. In the first few seconds I knew there was no way I would give them as a gift without feeling embarrassed. I posted a picture of them above. The left one is milky/chalky white that doesn't look natural. It looks like the stone was treated with something to make it look brilliant white. It also has a very obvious blemish noticeable from 10 inches away. The right one is dark yellowish brown. To me a diamond should instill perfection. Instead I look at these and feel 'bleeah'. I'm guessing from reading a lot of diamond reviews on amazon, it's really a gamble. Some people seem happy but there's a very large number of unhappy customers."
4,good quality for the price,easy to use. produce pretty good quality.it takes pretty long to process between the shots. So you won't be able to take quick continuous shots. But for the price it is pretty good value
2,Does not live up to Nikon quality,"I bought this camera on clearance at a local Target for $100 and even at that price think I paid too much for it. Outdoor shots with plenty of light are great, however anything indoors where the flash needs to be used are not. The flash takes an incredibly long time to recharge, and gives an unnatural illumination - deer in the head lights look. If you turn the flash off, there is no no image steady option besides bss (shoots multiple shots and picks the sharpest one). Also low light images have a tremendous amount of noise. The video recorder feature is great as long as you don't want sound. You hear the noise of the focusing motor over anyone talking, which is annoying and makes any audio unusable. The only plus to this camera is it's size, but even that can't compensate for it's quality issues. I would not buy this camera again."
2,Too slow!!,"Do not buy if you are taking pictures of anything alive!! If you like to wait for 10 secs of smiling before the picture snaps this camera is for you. What a great camera for still shots, but the shutter speed is the slowest I have ever seen. I cannot express enough how slow it is."
2,Clogged optico system,"to the 3 weeks of bought the optica mechanism big step, without to have received blow some. Showing the message of error in optica."
4,Works well with PDA...,"I like the concept... This product works well with my HP PDA, but I need to work out the problems I have with my HP dv1000 laptop. It does work well with the PDA so maybe there is something I am not doing properly. It does connect to my laptop, but it has problems approximately every two minutes with interference or distortion & eventually loses a signal. The range is only like 15-20 feet (MAX), but I'll get back to you on my laptop issues. Nice product, but needs to come with a preset code so info is not ""out there for othes to hear""."
2,I don't know if it works yet,I recently bought this product but I haven't been able to pair it with my Nokia 5300 because it's asking me for a passcode I don't have. Does anybody know how to reset the Jensen WBT310? I would greatly appreciate any information regarding this product. [...]
2,Pretty Good Compared to Others,"This is a good gun; almost my first. I've had a .177 gun before, but it was a pump action, not a CO2. 425 fps, good velocity, good power. Used frequently at my house; I have fun trying to shoot fish. It does NOT come with an orange tip, so you might want to spray paint one on it. The model I bought came with a laser sight, doesn't work very well in the daylight. And if you're like me, you have atendancy to leave electronics on- No way to change battery. When buying new CO2 cartridges, always buy the Daisy brand. Over all fair gun for the price."
3,Great intro but you need more,"This was a great book to act as an introduction and overview into the world of the Image Consultant. It is, however, very important to understand that you will need considerably more information than what is in the book, to be successful."
3,Over 100 bucks for a VHS is rediculous...,No matter how 'rare' it is.Even 50 bucks is a bit unrealistic.The only way I'd ever shell out an amount of money even close to that is if the movie was in DVD format.And my limit is 30 bucks.Oh. A little nudge nudge wink wink. There's technology out there that can let you record DVDs.I suggest people start looking into it.
5,It only took me 2 HOURS! To do the USS KittyHawk,"This is a great and fun Mega Bloks collectores series to collect. You can try to beat my time of 2 hours. (Oh I have the tank,Night Copter,Blue Thunder,Battleship,Cruiser from Lego's, the Ferris Wheel from K'NEX,Swat,Ice,and snow transfer from Lego's"
3,Chicago funk,"Here is a nice chicago funk from de 70's(but don t be mistaken, only the 3 first songs have been recorded in 72), wid a repeat of da famous song ""people makes da world go 'round"" who comes from the stylistiks.A nice live but not so groovy as you could have imagined it..."
3,Pray Hard,"I read the book Pray Hard, by Pamela Walker. THis is a realistic fiction book. The book is about a girl named Amelia Forrest, 12 years old, that is trying to deal with a lot of problems in her life. Amelia needs to pray for getting her horrible grades up, trying to get along better with her mom, and dealing with how she feels about her father's death. Amelia is about to loose all faith...I have mixed emotions about this book. I liked it because it had a religious side to it, but it was kind of depressing. I would have rather read a more uplifting book, but once I pick up a book, I usually finish it. I would recomend this book for middle school level kids."
5,Motorcycle Cargo Net,Very useful item at a reasonable price. Keeps my items very secure on the back of my bike.
5,cargo net,"This is everything that I expected and hoped for. Durable and secure. I keep my back-pack or brief case under it. For those not willing or ready to spend big money on bags, this is a great option. Well worth the price!"
4,"Good product, with a catch","This net is a really handy item that makes it easy to secure your stuff. The only problem I've found with it is when it's empty the hooks aren't secure. When I got my first one, I was riding around with it empty, rolled up and hooked in my basket, and at some point it came loose and bounced out, and I lost it. I liked it enough that I ordered another one, but I was pretty disappointed. I'd recommend using some kind of clip to keep it securely attached when it's empty. It'd be nice if it came with one. It's nicely heavy duty and elastic, though, and much easier to use than individual bungee cords."
2,This book is USELESS,"This is the most useless reference manual I ever read. I wanted to just write a simple Latex document with a few tables and a couple of embedded graphics. This book was so inadequate that I found myself going to the web resources repeatedly. I believe the point of writing a reference book is to provide a compilation of enough information so the readers don't have to go fishing for information for themselves. In that regard, the author failed miserably.A book of this size should be a simple tutorial book. There's not enough content to serve any use as a reference book. Very Disappointed!"
5,osho,"Certainly after reading this book, one realizes the greatness of this man. More importantly this book gives one the stepping stones to realizing the greatness in oneself. Not the superficial greatness often people confuse. A powerful book. Truly if the whole world read it and got it, an ecstatic and truly free world we would live in.This is why this book is dangerous to all corrupt structures, governments, religions, etc which is also why you will enjoy reading this book."
4,A good book for online students,"This book was quite informative concerning the history and evolution of online communication and learning. It is full of information that I would not have discovered had our professor not assigned it to us. I was unaware of many of the major advancements over the last twenty years or that online learning was even a concept in the 1970's. Though bits of it seem to meander over the same topics and say the same things, the book as a whole is quite effective in its mission to introduce online novices to the new ""society"" in which they are beginning to take part."
5,Provides great relief.,"I have put off for years getting support hose. I hated the idea that I had to use them. I have veins the size of Texas on my legs from my second pregnancy.These are really easy to put on. I love having my toes free. No cramped up toes. Plus, you can wear sandals without feeling totally dorky. The thigh high aspect is pretty cool too. I had concern about them falling down, but that has not been an issue. I actually like wearing them. I can tell when I have not worn them during the day.I am very active, working out 6 days a week. I wear these during the day when I am home. Since winter is coming I will probably wear them all the time now. They provide extra insulation too. That will come in handy."
5,Awesome,"These support hose are great. I was unsure about buying a thigh high but they stay up much better then I ever thought, and they feel great on sore tired legs. I recommend them without hesitation."
2,Not durable.,The first time one of these was put on it ripped in half. My husband has worn similar stockings for a year to control lymphedema in his leg following a wreck. The other half of the pair is fine.
3,Fun to read if you love Paula,"This is a fun book if you love to read a story about Paula Deen, but I was a little dissappointed there weren't more recipes."
1,Less Is More,"While I only read aportion of the bookI didn't like whatI read. While onecan appreciate herhonesty about theaffair with a married man, I thnkshe gave way toomuch information.Shouldn't be too hard for a lot ofpeople to figure out who that guywas. Did Paula wantthe wife to know orwas she trying toget even with thisguy. When she talked about her and Michael being nakedtogether on the bedthat was an imagethat quite franklyI could have donewithout. If I washer husband I would be embarrassedby this book. Themore Paula talks the more crass I think she is and showshow she has no class. Has she everheard the phrase""less is more?"""
2,Stick to Cook Books Paula,"This was about as boring of a book as Dolly Partons Autobiography that I had to read when I was younger. I could only stomach 2 chapters of this book before I started skimming it. Truth be told, my life story has more gripping ups and downs than this did. Stick to cook books Paula, they are way more interesting!"
4,"Oh, Momma Mia!","This was a very interesting book and a quick read. The best part to me was the spelling and frequent use of ""momma."" I've been a long-time proponent of that spelling (particularly in the South) instead of ""mama."" Paula pays wonderful tribute to all the women who shaped her character and made her such a loving momma, step-momma and grandmomma."
3,Paula's Not a Lady...She's a Good Ole Girl!,"Paula Deen really comes at you with a big truth pie in this book, doesn't she. Who really needs to know she had an adulterous affair, and puh-lease, I just don't want to know anything about Michael Groover BTS (between the sheets). Too many of Paula's revelations were cringe-worthy. I liked Paula a whole lot more before I read her story. This book was definitely three parts schmaltz, one part inspiration.I will hand it to her...she's one helluva cook."
4,Down-to-earth Southern Belle,"Paula Deen needs to be commended for her ability to inspire other women to achieve greatness in life and in the kitchen! She's a down-to-earth, Southern Belle who has worked hard for the success she deserves...quite an inspiration. I've tried many of her recipes and they are relatively easy to make and equally delicious to eat. Thanks, Paula, for telling it like it is and for sharing your cooking super-talents. Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsandSweet Apple Temptations"
4,Gotta Love Her!,"As honest as Abe Lincoln and as comfortable as an old shoe---that's Paula Deen. Sometimes foul-mouthed, sometimes downright nasty, Paula is nothing if not herself, in all her false-eyelashed glory. This memoir is, by turns, heartbreaking and laugh-out-loud funny. It paints a portrait of a fiercely loving woman who reached down inside herself to find the strength to overcome her painful psychological illness. The only distraction from this tasty morsel is that the attempt to capture Paula's wonderful dialect on the printed page seems highly contrived and artificial. Whose fault could that be? Surely not Paula's!"
5,Long Live The King!,"Forget 4th edition - it's an de-evolution of the RPG.While there are many who will argue there are plenty of problems with the 3E version of the game, the truth is that 3.5E is the culmination of the D&D; game; the largest number of options, the most varied way to play and handle anything in the D&D; game. It has a solid mix of in-combat and out-of-combat options to allow for nearly any play style one wishes to pursue.It's completeness is, in some ways its own downfall. The sheer volume of material available for 3E can bankrupt an individual. There are rules for everything, and just about anything can be quantified if you look hard enough. DMing for 3E can be quite a chore at the higher levels and it doesn't work so well after 10th level (but no edition of D&D; ever really has, truth be told).With the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual, you have enough for nearly endless hours of gameplay."
4,Player's Handbook,The drawings are a little cartoonish...but still a great book. Now I just have to find some Die Hard D&D players.
1,Poorly Edited,"The Player's Handbook is a poorly edited and, seemingly, rushed work. There are inconsitancies throughout the entire 3.5 core set. Changes were made in one area and then the old rule was copied word for word in another area or book. Avoid 3.5 until official errata or a 2nd printing."
1,Planned obsolescence,"One of the chief creators of D&D 3rd Edition has stated on his website that Wizards of the Coast always planned to put out a ""3.5"" consisting of little more than errata and new artwork once sales of the 3rd Edition began to dip - which they expected to happen in 2004 or 2005. Apparently WotC needs that economic shot in the arm ahead of schedule. This creator goes on to note that the changes have proven to be somewhat more substantial than that. However, it very much remains to be seen whether they actually improve the game at all. Given the cynical conception of this product, the average D&D gamer - who has already funneled hundreds of dollars into the pockets of this publisher who stupidly bet the ranch on the enduring appeal of Pokemon - may be forgiven a degree of skepticism."
4,"If you held back from 3rd ed, now's the time to jump in","D&D 3.0 looked great on the outside, and felt great when you started playing, you assumed all the little confusions would clear up when you got to know the system better.But three years down the line, high level campaigns well underway, and you're discovering your DM is having to make arbitary rulings on things left right and centre because of abiguities or problems with the rules.Well now it's been cleared up well and good. The flavour still seems to be there, but there's a consistency and ordered logic about the new system that makes it easier to pick up on the rules, and it looks like judgement calls will be well down on the old system."
3,"Probably very good, but very difficult to read.","This book was recommended by a very learned Pastor who I respect. However, as a layman, I found it almost impossible to unravel what was being taught. I know Norman Geisler is a very knowledgeable man, but for my intellectual level this book was way too difficult. I am saving it on my bookshelf for when I get smarter!!"
4,Exactly what i wanted,"Stylish, yet practical. Everyone whose seen my money clip has awed in its unique structure. After clipping a thick load of bills, I can no longer clip only one or two bills, but that was foreseeable."
3,"We love this series, but...","two problems:1 - you can't get all of season 2 on one disc yet, so each volume only has 6 episodes, and only 2 volumes available (as of 12/12)2 - Season 2, IMHO, is not as good as 1. We miss the adventures in the search for the Makluan (sp?) rings. This season has a completely different feel. It's not that it's bad, it's just missing a particular element of fun that we were enjoying in Season 1.Also, our kids are on the younger side (K/1st grade) and Season 2 is ""older,"" more scary stuff, more intense action, situations they don't really get, etc. The bad guy action is much more pronounced. We severely limit their watch time of this. I still think this"
2,Extremely disappointed.,"Let me be clear, I ordered this as a Christmas present for my brother, so I can't review the software. However, the packaging I received it in was clearly not the original packaging. The case contained an insert which looked printed from a computer (it was crooked in the dvd case and faded looking...as many bootlegs appear), and the instructions were placed in the envelope it was mailed in, with no software box to contain it. If this were an inexpensive item, I'd have less of an issue, but for the price I paid and the fact it's being given as a present, I expected more than this."
1,Get what you paid for,"Once again, another ""get what you paid for"" product.It would work 10% of the time only after jiggling the usb corb or the actual adaptor in the car port. For it's description as a ""USB charging device"" it didn't fit a USB cable. It was very loose and only works at certain angles. I ended up throwing this away."
2,breaks easily,"within the first week i used this, one plastic piece broke off this machine. now, another crucial plastic piece has broken off of the foaming arm - just 3 months later. i also agree with a previous reviewer - i had to run about 10 cycles of water through it to remove metal debris before i even made the initial cup of espresso. also note that the foaming arm is very short...i do give it two stars, though, because it is so inexpensive that it did pay for itself within a week."
4,A bit dissapointing but overall a great read!,"Acorna's Quest is a fabulous read! It's full of excitement and suspence. When Acorna and her ""uncle"" Calum go on the adventure of their lives to find Acorna's people they end up in more trouble they dreamed possible. Captured by space pirates, tormented by angry ""dirtside"" farmers and getting caught in the middle of a war keeps this book suspenseful and most entertaining. Acorna's character is even better developed and improved upon. The book is a little slow at times however and I was dissapointed how quickly Acorna dumped Pal Kendero and of how little romance there was. I give this book 4 stars and reccomend it to all fantasy mavens."
4,"Excellent read, even if you have not read the first book","A wonderful story, it captures you and I just had to read it whenever I could, on the tram, on the toilet, any moment I could. I loved it, and hope you will too!! Acorna is the sort of alien we hope we might meet one day for real. She is different yet we can identify with her feelings when she is looking for her kin."
4,"A little slow to start, the end makes up for it..","She' done it again. there are alot of people in this book to keep track of,some to help set up for the next book. I love the ending. It doesn't get much better than this."
1,"This book, while OK, had very little literary value.","This book, in my opionion, stunk. I usually love fantasy and sci-fi, but this was awful. The plot was horrible, deus ex machina abounded, and Karina? Puh-leez. Don't get me wrong, the characters were well developed and quite interesting, but this does not live up to Anne McCaffry's usual standerds and 'Acorna'. And, no, I am not a teacher, or a proffessor, I am a 15-year-old sophmore."
1,Halex dart board sucks,This is the worse excuse for a bristle board I've ever encountered. The darts would not stay in the board more than 80% of the time. I would not waste your time or money on this product.
3,"Good for darts, faulty electronics","The games like a real dart board. The electronic scoring is pretty accurate and very easy to use. However, the buttons are often unresponsive to being pressed (mine was a refurbished unit). I like the laser toe line - nice touch."
4,Beading at it's best,Very good for new designs and techniques. I thought that the pictures and descriptions were very good. Well worth reading.
2,Not my style,"I didn't find anything in this book that I could imagine either myself or any of my family or friends actually wearing. Maybe some this jewelry was stylish when the book was published, but I didn't see anything here that I thought I would make even with substituting beads. Some of the jewelry was huge! I ended up selling it in a yard sale. One book I got around the time I bought this one isMaking Beaded Jewellery: Over 80 Beautiful Designs to Make and Wear. It uses similar techniques but the designs are more subtle."
5,Totally stays with you,"I love short stories, and these are some of the best I've read in a long time. They're sort of like A.M. Homes or Mary Gaitskill's stories: Funny and haunting and good at getting at what it's like when you encounter the threats and promises of the adult world as you grow up."
5,A Good Kind Of Hurt,"Rachel Sherman's book is impossible to put down. Its language is precise and vivid and the stories themselves so emotionally fine-tuned, I felt as if I were on the verge of laughing or crying the whole way through."
2,Poor Toshiba Warranty,"Picture is perfect and very pleased overall, BUT, the TV sits crooked on its stand and Toshiba calls this cosmetic. They would replace the TV if we paid the $130 to have it shipped back to them. Needless to say we did not return it but put pieces of rubber under the base so it would sit straight."
2,Get Huge...NOT!,"Ok, I knew I wasn't going to get larger, but I thought I might get better erections. Nothing! But if your a bodybuilder you might want to use it to increase your energy levels. That's about all it did for me. At least I got something out of it, but not what I bought it for."
4,really good stuff,"No matter who put out this album...it's a winner. Put aside any preconceived notions of who you think Lisa Marie is. The lyrics are striking and her voice is deep, husky at times, strong at times and a bit week at other times. Musically, the sound is rockin' with a country-ish flair. I think a few songs could be a little more power rock. Lisa is new as a singer, her voice is wonderfully unique and once she finds the true range of the power in it, she will have one of the best voices in rock/pop."
2,Kelly Clarkson could have done these songs better,"Kelly Clarkson could have done these songs better. Lisa Marie Presley's first album is cold, bland, disconnected, disjointed rock. I don't see her as very exciting either. The writing's horrible, Lisa cusses on several songs, and she sounds so cold and arrogant on some tracks. The songs sound like rejected '80s arena rock songs that Bon Jovi wouldn't even do."
4,It's about time,"Provocative and thought provoking. There is more to Lisa than meets the eye. Having seen her recently promoting this CD, I was intrigued. Now having bought this CD and I am amazed at the depth & saltiness from the image provoking lyrics. ""Nobody Noticed It"", and ""Lights Out"" are my favorites thus far. This lady is no dummy and her songs emit strength and softness. Way to go Lisa Marie Presley!"
4,AWSOME,This cd is awsome...she is not trying to be her dad. so dont say shes nothin like her dad. shes making her OWN path and I think she is doing it right! nuff said! why ONLY 4 stars? Because there are some parts i can barely understand what she says...but what I can understand is that shes great!
3,She definitely has talent!,Lisa Marie definitely has talent but I'd like to hear more of her voice and less of the music. She was drowned out in places by the music. I wish the music were a bit more upbeat too. Due to the choice of words there were 4 songs that I wouldn't let my children hear. Perhaps she could clean up her language also.
5,Lisa Marie Presley's To Whom it May Concern,"Awesome! Lisa Marie has a soulful, sultry voice, I never expected her to be so good. Each song is a peek into her life and she rocks!"
5,lisa marie presely-to whom it may concern,"ok this is the second best cd ive bought or heard this year. its so darkk and she combines a lot of different styles of music like in S.O.B., she combines country with rock. i recomend it to everyone.believe me, it wont dissapoint you."
2,OK...,"I thought I would give this cd a try. It was ok. I listened to it a couple times and it's been sitting in my closet ever since. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't one of my favorites."
1,"""Kamylla"" from New Hampshire","Raters, you have got to be kidding? Just one star given this album is one too many! Where has Lisa Marie been all these years? All of a sudden she's a music diva? No way. She has no sparkle, pizzazz, but especially she has no voice! Come on... get real... spend your money on artists that can sing and show it in their recordings and interviews."
3,"Good idea, bad execution","There's nothing inherently wrong with ""To Whom It May Concern"", the debut album from Elvis Presley's little girl. If you grade it on the celebrity recording curve, it's an A+.But if you compare the album to legitimate music, it falls short. Surprisingly, that's not because of Lisa Marie herself, whose voice is certainly better than Jennifer Love Hewitt's. (if not professional grade) Nor does it suffer for the lyrics, which, if nothing else, are stark and confessional.No, the problem with the album is this: in an attempt to make Presley radio-friendly (which she's not) the music doesn't compliment the lyrics at all. The production isn't necessarily the problem - Sheryl Crow has made a nice career on slickly produced music in this vein - but putting a honky-tonk track behind ""Lights Out"" and swooping strings behind ""Important"" make those songs seem, well, less important. Lisa Marie Presley has something to say, but it's hard to take it seriously when it's over this soundtrack."
1,BAD TASTE,"This video is the worst ever. I could not understand a wordshe said. Then when I got out the lyrics to the music, I couldn't believe what I was reading. The language was awful.I am hoping I am able to return mine. She is nothing like her dad."
1,"Uh, well.....","A name can open a door. But. Lisa Marie gets in the door and delivers some growling and snarling in her lyrics, but like other reviewers have said, the CD is overproduced, and similar to Britney's latest CD, darned near impossible to hear her true voice because of all the vocal processing. This is an insult to the artist and a disservice by her record label. I wonder at the issues this lady can have being a spoiled, pampered multi millionaire since birth. All that privilege doesn't resonate in her lyrics. There is no sweetness in any of the songs. The CD sounds like an angry, defiant diatribe against everything in a collection of unmemorable songs."
4,Good book!,Nice insight into the WHY of hiking as opposed to the how. While we may dream of being 'thru-hikers' the reality of most people's lives is the weekend or week-long backpacking trip. This well-written and thoughtful book may push many of those people to chuck it all and fulfill that dream.
4,Para pensar,"Este libro es muy bueno. Hace sentir en carne propia el fracaso en que cae este profesor de literatura autoexiliado (y muy marcado con sus vivencias durante el Golpe de Estado) con aires de escritor... pero solo aire... solo aspiraciones. En realidad todos esperamos ser más de lo que somos, y nos mortificamos cuando sentimos que estamos lejos, y no aceptamos que no lo somos... Más que en hechos, esta obra se basa en pensamientos. Mientras el mundo da una vuelta, la cabeza de Julio Méndez da mil... y ""su mundo"", también."
2,fancy reamer doesn't relace the plain wooden type,I found the Cuisinart metal reamer difficult to use compared to the old original wooden one. The metal slips around in my hand and doesn;t get as much juice as the wood type.I am definitely going back to my origina wooden reamer and donating the metal one to a bazaar.
2,Didn't Notice Much,"I took this for a few months and didn't really notice much of a change. I take around 15 supplements each day from vitamins, probiotics, to pills for my vision, and I like to try new ones from time to time to see if I can improve how I feel. As with many in the past this pill did not really change my health or mood, at least not enough for me to notice and make purchasing it again worth my while. Maybe it works for some, maybe it will work for you, but at least for me, I'll keep searching and trying new things."
2,didn't work for me,I was hoping this would help me to be calmer and more serene. I took it twice a day for a month and didn't notice much difference. Some days I was calm and I thought it was helping but then the next day something stressful would happen and I would react as usual. The only supplement that I've ever taken where I've really noticed an improvement in my energy and focus is bio-strath. Everyone is different obviously - what helps one person may not help another and it seems that Holy Basil has been very effective for some.
2,No effect,"First off, I'm sure this supplement is harmless. Basil: Nothing wrong with that. Of course, fresh basil in your food would be best, but these supplements are far more convenient.However, given that these pills cost real money, it's worth asking whether there are real benefits. So I tried them. I can't speak to any of the more outlandish claims (""Supports normal insulin metabolism""? ""Protects healthy cells from radiation?""), which don't appear to have any studies backing them up. I don't have any blood sugar issues or other health problems, other than sometimes feeling stressed out. So I was hoping that these pills would ""promote natural stress relief,"" as the bottle says. Alas, I noticed no difference in stress levels while taking these pills.If you try these pills and find that they ""elevate your spirit,"" then by all means stick with them. But as for me, I suspect that my money would be better spent on other things."
3,There's Perhaps a Modicum of Bliss Here,"I'll come straight out and say that I don't take any regular vitamins or supplements, so there's probably a lot that I'm not aware about in this area. Still, I took these guys regularly and according to instructions while I had them. I suppose that I may have felt a bit of a mood improvement, but it wasn't enough for me to rule out the placebo effect. I didn't have any weird side effects or anything, so at least there aren't any immediate negatives to taking these. I can't say that I have any urge to run out and get some more, and I certainly don't feel like paying for more. I doubt you'll find much harm from giving these a try, but I'm not convinced that they're anything more than innocuous snake oil."
3,find the oil capsules...,go for the oil capsules if you find them... more potent effect. Gotta love Holy Basil though- it gets the cortisol down and keeps you feeling very relaxed.
3,"uhh, i dont know","This stuff sure did make me want to go to the bathroom. I'm always looking for something to help with my depression, but this really didnt do much."
3,gift of coolter,the top of the cooler was bented and there was some type of sticky substance all around the top i was not happy about this gift i purchasedsincerely
4,Cleverness had something to do with it,"This book is so much fun to read, and Ms. McPhee is such a highly intelligent and clever writer, that she almost gets away with the complex cosmological theories that she keeps dragging into the action in the most far-fetched ways. Her delightful quotes, both real and made up, go a long way toward making up for that. Disappointingly, her characters, though amusing and cleverly conceived, almost never rise above the cartoon level -- I kept expecting them to, almost to the very end. A perhaps minor but distracting quibble: For all of her intelligence and obviously good education, Ms. McPhee doesn't seem to know (nor do the copyeditors and proofreaders at Doubleday) that the past tense of the transitive verb ""lay"" is ""laid,"" not ""lay."""
5,Delbert is great.,"I never tire of listening to Delbert's music - both the older and his more recent creations. His energy is intoxicating. Anytime I play his songs I start dancing around the house and singing along. Having recently had the good fortune to see him in a live show I enjoy it even more. ""I'm with you"" is great!"
4,Very good price for this oil Filter,"I bought 3 of this oil filter for very good price plus free shipping. but when I get them at my home 2 of them the top of them were broking, so I had to call Amazon Customer service and they were very nice the shipped a 2 new oil filter and I resave it in the next day and also retune tag for what I have. In the end I really liked it and I will buy next time more from Amazon."
4,Great Ideas - Better Framework,"The book contains some great ideas, and, includes some nice examples. But, the Figures (which are useful) seem out of sync with the text at times. Forces the reader to jump around a bit to follow along. But, don't let that stop you from reading it. Of course, the Authors had me hooked as soon as I saw that they also seemed to be fans of Bossidy's Execution.Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done"
3,LeBaron rview,This book took me awhile to read. I felt i should finish it . I would have loved hearing about his every day life. To bad he is no longer here to reveal his mind frame during that part of his life.
5,I love the product,"The pouch looks great! my blackberry 8120 fits good, but with the rubber skin, it is a little tight. Over all, i love the product."
1,"Its a remake, and the original wasn't even that good.","This is a remake with a new title of Urla's NYStyle Pilates dvds and videos released earlier this year on this very site. As a Pilates instructor who studied with Romana it is clear that this is far from the 'real deal' Urla claims it to be on his description. While the settings and actors are 'pretty', the constantly skewed camera angles are distracting as is the music. There are drags on the tape and obvious voice over corrections that add to the distraction of constant cuts of the camera shots. He claims to be a seasoned instructor, who should know that clear and simple makes Pilates easier and more effective. I'm not a big fan of Windsor Pilates, as they look for a shortcut to fitness, but this is the other extreme - too much talking and not enough workout"
5,This book needs to be reprinted!,"I am sorry to see that this book is no longer in print. Before a trip to Rome, I purchased 'An Architect's Rome' and read it from cover to cover. Reading 'An Architect's Rome' helped me plan my trip and as I read my enthusiasm for Rome increased. By the time I arrived in Rome I felt as if I knew the city and was returning to visit my favorite places. The author transfered his love for the city to me. On the author's recommendation I took the Ostia Antica day trip and thoroughly enjoyed the day. This is the best book on Rome that I have read."
5,Jann Browne,"I first heard this album when it was released and really loved Jann's voice.She is the best.Give it a listen,you wont be disappointed.I dont think she was given the radio play she deserved.She is a beautiful and talented lady.More,Jann,More!!"
3,Imprecise descriptuion,"What I received was two alternative pairs of 1 on/1 off rather than two matching pairs giving 2 on and 2 off switchings. I thought I had ordered the latter in order to achieve the desired programming. This should have been clear in your description, or did you send me the wrong pack? (Ordered and received in USA from Amazon.com)"
5,intermatic timer switch tripper set,"great product. this was a replacement for the original. installed easy, works great."
5,Fits Intermatic,These fit my Intermatic timers that I wanted to add on-off times to. I first bought GE ones from the local hardware store but they would not fit the Intermatic brand.
5,One Taste,"The 3rd Karmapa's text on Mahamudra, the higest state of space and bliss, is given a fresh new perspective by Tibetan Master Lama Ole Nydhal. The comparison between the experience of higest wisdom and jumping out of a plane is just brillant. As with all of Ole's works the commentary turns you on to your own inner potential (Buddha Nature) rather than waste time with dry scholarly debate. Ole succedes where traditional masters falter and brings these timeless teachings to the western world. Read and enjoy."
4,Ruddy discloses the facts; you draw the conclusions,"Whether your predilection is liberal or conservative, you must agree that the death of Vincent Foster was most unusual. Christopher Ruddy focuses on these unusual circumstances in a compelling narrative that reveals the possibility of obstruction of justice both within and outside the White House. I read the book cover to cover without putting it down. The thing I liked most about Ruddy's treatment was the fact that he did not confuse the reader by inserting his own beliefs into the book. He states the facts, but doesn't draw the obvious conclusions. He allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. If you like a good murder mystery; if you like a good conspiracy drama; if you like to believe that someone still cares about the Constitution, you'll like this book."
5,Disgusted,There is a reason why this book is so hard to find...there are people who dont want this information out there. I was glued to this book until I was finished. I always felt as if the story that the news media and the government gave us was acceptable until I read this book!
1,terrible,Pioneer did a terrible job creating a disk with no karaoke version. The Beatles dont deserve Pioneer's ill-fated mistake.
2,Disappointing,"If you're into the fighting scenes as I am you will be disappointed with this one. This one had three episodes and the last episode was the only one that contained any fight scenes. The fight scene was when Vegeta and Napa land on the planet Arlias. However, if you're a collector, this must be added to the your collection cos of the story factor."
1,Terrible Product,These things are just hard plastic. Not rubbery enough at all. They just don't work. Plain and simple. Strong recommendation NOT to buy these.
4,I like the design so much I copied the design and cast them in pewter,I like the design of these wine bottle stoppers so much that I copied the design and cast them in Britannia (pewter). I used the silicon rubber seals from the original Pedrini stopper.
4,A worthy addition to any industrial fan's collection,"Informatik uses purely electronic music to create songs that are both calm/atmosphereic and fairly fast-paced. If you are a fan of industrial music, you will probably like this album...especially if you like Decoded Feedback. There are a couple tracks on this CD that seem a little bland, but for the most part it's a solid buy. Also, check out the releases by Informatik's side project band, Din Fiv."
3,This is more of a pamphlet than a book,"I was dissapointed to find that this book was so small (only 18 pages). The illustrations are very good and instructions seem clear but I was just expecting more than about 9 projects.For me this was not worth $7.95 plus shipping, I will be returning it and looking for something else.Easy Bead Woven Bracelets (Easy-Does-It)"
5,Perfect Resource!,"Bienvenu covers everything the presentation skills trainer needs from how to sell the training to management to exactly what to say in class. I had some experience presenting and training, but when I had to prepare a presentation workshop, this book saved my life! I got it right--with confidence! I recommend this book for trainer and presenters alike. Thanks for a great book!"
2,Does not work for me.,"I have tried this product many times while stricken with a headache, and it simply has not worked for me."
5,Seem to be high quality vitamins,"It's very difficult to review vitamins because without a blood test you have no idea if they're really working. What I can say is that these vitamins are packaged very well, are in an amber bottle to protect the vitamins from light, have no odor, and are relatively small and easy to swallow since they are softgels. The suggested dose is two softgels daily and I've had no problems with upset stomach or any digestive issues. If you're looking for these ingredients in a vitamin, then you might want to give these a try since they seem well manufactured."
1,Dissappointed,I have been having mild to moderate bph issues for a couple of years now. I have used a couple of different products with varying success. I ordered Prostrate 5lx on the recommendation of a alternative medicine type doctor. Immediatley upon finishing the product I was previously using and beginning the 5lx my symptoms worsened. I don't so much have frequency issues but cannot completely empty my bladder and have dribbling and definite sexual problems as a result. I will be ordering something else as I went backwards using this.
3,"probably a good product, but green tea is much less expensive","This is a convenient, easy-to-take supplement. However, green tea, which also helps prostate health - and is one of the ingredients in this product - is MUCH, MUCH less expensive on its own. This product has other ingredients in addition to the green tea though - so if you aren't worried about spending the extra money and you want more reassurance about your prostate health, this is probably a good way to go."
1,No Effect,"Took the whole bottle...no effect. Nothing. Feel like i got took, but it was worth a shot. On the plus side I didn't feel any negative side effects, so it was basically a placebo. dud."
5,I'm Stunned! It works!,"Most cures or herbs fall short of working. I bought this more on a lark than any real belief that it would work. WOW, after two weeks, everything is working great! I'm sure it will not work for everyone, but what a cheap and easy fix for enlarged prostate. This being my first bottle I took double the dose, until the prostate returns to normal."
5,I assume it works?,"I'm giving this stuff 5 stars because Amazon has the best price and the shipping is fast, but it is impossible to tell if this stuff actually helps your prostate. I guess it will be years before I find out. I will write a follow up review to this one in a few years and tell you if I think it worked."
5,BOOK REPORT,"IT WAS ALL GREAT: THE DESCRIPTION, THE DELIVERY AND THE PRODUCT ITSELF. THIS IS AN ACTION NOVEL, BUT IT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE MADE INTO A MOVIE... AND ESPECIALLY NOT A ""CHICK-FLICK""!"
3,Sociopathic Hero,"I have read all the series and to tell the truth, John Rain is beginning to wear a little thin. He is a relatively one dimensional, amoral character and it's hard to find anything to like about this assassin who will kill anyone for a price despite the fact he sometimes questions if he did the right thing in the same way normal people might wonder if they should have had the green beans instead of the mashed potatoes.The first 2 books in the series were exciting and entertaining but this one had difficulty holding my interest, probably because Rain is so predictable once you know the character.I'll read the next installment just to see if Eisler can breathe any life into this character or the irritating Dox."
5,"The more you use them, the more you realize how great they are!","I think these cards are amazing! I am a believer of divine guidance because I have asked for Heaven's help and everytime I need an answer, I receive them. I don't feel alone anymore and I am confident that I am guided in the right direction. I have about 15 decks from different Authors and each deck is unique. At first, I wasn't crazy about the art work on the cards but I would take out a card and felt that it was sending me a strong message. Over time, the art has come alive and dances with me as I confidently follow good advise from a special friend. I use to be co-dependent but life has taught me hard lessons so now I am learning to be my own best friend. These cards are perfect with breakfast as I begin my day seeing my life clearer. I know I need constant nourishment and reassurance. If you are searching for answers, you will receive them."
3,Ho Hum,"Ordering process was fine, condition also fine, book itself, well theBook itself not very interesting after all. Cant win them all."
3,Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"Based on my experience, the wrist monitor gives low bp readings compared to arm cuff monitor used by my Dr.; however, it is useful to track blood pressure trend over time....just don't rely on single readings to be accurate compared to arm cuff monitor. Software included is also useful for summarizing and charting readings."
5,Cuff BP Monitor,Omron HEM-670IT Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) and Advanced Omron Health Management SoftwareThe product is easy to use and the measurements are legible and easy to interpret. Unfortunately the Health Management software is not Mac compatible.
3,Accuracy,I am not sure if this product is accurate since it does not pump up to the third level. I think it should get up to at least 170 but doesn't get past 160.
4,Blood pressure device,Works well once you get the hang of it. I use my left wrist. Put your left elbow on the table and slowly raise your wrist until the arrow goes through the heart on the screen.
5,great product!,"this blood pressure monitor is easy to use, and has a sensor which tells you where to position your hand. and it has software to graph your results, if you're feeling obsessive!"
5,"Accurate, small. light, easy to use, great software","I've had over 10 devices in the past 7 years. Only a few were truly accurate and only one of the two with PC link was accurate. I'm always on the road and need a device that would be small, accurate, easy to use and that would store the readings and export them into Excel. Well this device has all this and mucho more. Its worth its price (and even more).Great device!"
5,Omron HEM-670IT,This device delivers readings very close to my cuff model blood pressure monitor. It is easy to use and to keep a record with the provided software.
1,NO STARS FOR THIS JUNK BUT HAD TO CLICK ONE TO PROCEED,I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE LAST YEAR AND IT BROKE AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS - DUMMY ME I WENT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE THINKING I HAD JUST GOTTEN A FLUKE - WELL THIS ONE LASTED LESS THAN A WEEK - ALL I GET IS ERROR - WOULDN'T INFLATE EVEN AFTER I PUT IN NEW BATTERIES - THIS WAS SENT BACK FOR A REFUND - WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY- I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS GETS GOOD REVIEWS - I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT BAD ONES - LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
2,Disappointing,"I believe that the wrist monitor shipped to me is defective. I intend to return it today. If the monitor worked as advertised, I would be quite satisfied with the features and design. The unit gave very low blood pressure readings as compared to an arm monitor by Omron that I have owned for years. I made an appointment with our family doctor that confirmed the low results. A call to Omron and the customer rep said that the results should be within 3 points of an my arm monitor. My results vary from 10 to 20 points lower on the systolic reading. Also, the LED readout is hard to discern. The numbers should be black, but appear to be dark gray. It is likely that I just received a defective machine."
1,Absolute junk!,"This is the third blood pressure monitor that I have gone through from Omron in two months. I have used prior versions of these products purchased four years ago when I was first diagnosed with hypertension. I don't know what is going on with quality control at Omron, but the three units I recently went through all failed in short order. This wrist untit failed after only a week of use. I will also note that the HEM-670IT didn't seem to be as well made and robust as the model it replaced.Don't waste your money. Find another brand because quality has taken a nose dive at Omron."
1,Omron HEM-670IT - does not function well,I have never been able to get a systolic BP reading of over 99 with this product. Office BP runs 120s to 140s over 70s to 80s. Incredibly disappointing.
1,Difficult for Seniors,I purchased the Omron HEM-670IT wrist blood pressure monitor. The description sounded easy and promising because I could record thereadings on my computer too. Just getting the monitor itself to workcorrectly was a challenge....you have to hold it in a certain positionto your heart for it to work. Seniors who have difficulty with armmovements will find this impossible to deal with as I did.Went right back to the older style which always works easily and quickly.
2,No practical value,"If you are looking for practical principles that you can apply to teaching or creating educational software don't bother looking in this book unless you think principles like the following, #30 in the book, has practical value: ""Learning is set up in such a way that learners come to think consciously and reflectively about some of their cultural models regarding the world, without denigration of their identities, abilities, or social affiliations, and juxtapose them to new models that may conflict with or otherwise relate to them in various ways."" The other 35 principles aren't any better."
2,How dumb do you think we are?,"Mr. Collins seems to think CNN and other major news organizations present unvarnished, unbiased news. How dumb does he think we are? All major news organizations bias the information they present either by selective reporting and failure to cover stories, by use of biased language (""conservative talk radio,"" ""radical clerical,"" ""anti-abortion,"" ""pro-choice,"" etc) and for most by a completely secular blindness. This book is junk food for the secular, partisan Democrats and for those who see conspiracy everywhere."
1,Exhorbitant Menus for no Recipes,"The title suggests that there would be some content regarding Sales Training. More so it suggests that the performance of recipients would improve post application of that content. I am amazed at the selection of the title, which is totally misleading, and 'am even more amazed at the pricing because what one gets is an extensive list of Menus, but no Recipes at all - where's the Training Content...I have returned the title."
1,Never buy and X2GEN product,Their web site link for on-line RMAs has been broken for over two weeks. No one answers the phone that is listed on their web site and no one replies to any emails. Please do not ever buy an X2gen product!!!!
2,Not recommended for toddler under 3.5,"We absolutely loved the Take Apart Airplane which is why we purchased its cousin, the Take Apart Crane. What a disappointment. Right away, I sensed toddler frustration with all the different parts. It's simply too difficult for a toddler to put together on his/her own. In fact, I often tell our toddler to ask Daddy to help since it annoys me too! Plus the actual crane contraption doesn't open unless you pry it open and risk injury so don't mind the photo where the crane seems open. I think they photoshopped adult hands out.I'm hiding this toy and trying again when my toddler hits the 3.5 mark. Not worth the toddler and personal frustrations!"
5,Kid loves this plane,"Got this for my ""almost"" 3 year old for Christmas. He loves it! We have a lot of fun playing with it/building it/taking it apart. If your kid loves planes like mine (we live close to Boeing) they'll love this. Even though he doesn't quite yet grasp the concept of fitting the bits into the screws/bolts the way they are shaped is very forgiving and allows him to do it with very little help from me. My only small issue with this is the drill doesn't feel like it's gonna last long, and the directional switch sometimes doesn't work. Other than that, a fun toy!"
4,Good But not Great !,"I would Rate this toy for a child About 3 1/2 rather than 3 if he's playing by himself . Takes sometime getting used to but gets the children really excited ! screws get a little loose and eventually not sturdy to play with the finished toy unless tightened by an adult . If tightened too much , the Kid cant get them out later cause the drill motor on the toy is'nt powerful enough . But all in all serves the purpose , It's pretty big , kids like it ."
4,Great Toy for 3-4 year that likes to build,"The upper crane part may be too complicated for a 3 year old, but they don't have to take it apart do they? Otherwise it is a well made and fun toy."
5,Hugh Hit,I purchased this for my three year old grandson for Christmas. I was not familiar with this brand but I'm go glad I ordered it. It is a good size and the drill fits their hands perfectly. After about 20 minutes of coaching from his uncle my grandson could change all the drill bits and put the plane together by himself. My son say his three boys play with it everyday. I had many inquiries where I had found it and I would purchase itagain.
5,Take Apart Plane,Granddaughter loves it. She likes the electric tool even when not taking anything apart or putting it together. A fun plane for 3 years of age and up.
1,Unfortunate,"Unfortunately, this is not very good. My son received 3 different take-a-part toys from this line. The other two (the airplane and the ""jeep"") were great. This one, however, is not. The crane arm's movement constantly loosens the screws and causes the crane arm to fall apart. It is very frustrating to this adult, let alone to my 3-year-old. He is happy to play with the other toys, this one not so much. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,a lot of pieces,"I got this for my just turned 4 year old and he's not interested in it at all. We put it together one time and now it's in pieces and it has several parts so it's a matter of finding them all to reassemble it.It's made really well though. I hope as he gets older he'll enjoy it. If not, I'll donate it and I know some other child will."
3,What the difference between Talent & Creativity,To pose a question like the above is a good outcome for buying a book such as this in itself. Fascinating - this book won't make you talented BUT it might make you determined and a bit more self confident!
5,Summary,"""Herb Ritts is one of today's most sought-after and accomplished photographers--an artist whose eye for beauty, playful intelligence, and unerring sense of style pervade all his work, from elegant fashion tableaux and witty celebrity portraits to sultry nudes and stunning African panoramas. This landmark retrospective presents the full range of Ritts' work--240 signature images, including many which have never before been published.""- from the Publisher"
2,Intro to Divine Office (Liturgy of the hours),Thought this would be more useful in to understanding the depth and concept of the Liturgy of the Hours. I haven't really used it and it isn't of any necessity to buy with any of the other books.
4,Eucerin as Sunscreen,"My dermatologist insists I protect my fair skin by using sunscreen on my face daily. Most are oily and can damage contact lenses if it gets in your eyes. I tried several ""beauty"" lotions with sunscreen in them, and Eucerin was the best. Being a guy, I'm not used to putting on ""make-up"" daily, but this stuff is easy to apply, soaks in quickly, and more effective than even Bullfrog as a sunscreen!"
1,Doesn't work for my sensitive skin and doesn't absorb...,"Overall, it sits on my skin and I wouldn't be able to put makeup over it because it doesn't absorb into my face. My face ends up looking sweaty even though I haven't broken a sweat! The product also has a strong chemical smell like a very cheap sunscreen. It is also drying, which is weird for a moisture lotion. If you sweat while wearing this, you will get white streaks on your clothing and face.I've kept this bottle for only one reason and that is to use it if I run out of the good stuff and that isn't often. I guess you get what you pay for. This is cheap as in price and in quality. I highly recommendAveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 oz.over this one."
3,great in moderation,"I have sensitive skin and used this all over my face and it gave me a dry rash under one of my eyes. So don't use this around the eye area.It does slightly dry out my skin so I use this selectively and usually only apply this to my forehead, cheek apples, nose, ears, tip of chin and center of decollete. I can't use it all over since it dries out my cheeks, sides of chin, neck and eye area.SO TO SUMMARIZE: Use a lighter more natural face lotion with spf 15 all over face and then apply this only to parts of your face that stick out.A great all over facial moisturizer/sunscreen to use in addition to this is Yes To Carrots moisturizer/spf15"
2,Find another solution,"I have only one set of RCA cables running thru my wall into my 50"" plasma. I wanted to hook up the wii and the DVD player, so I was in the market for a switch. I read other reviews about interference, but I thought I'd get lucky. I didn't. There are slow rolling bands of dark picture that constantly scan the screen. If you're any kind of TV fan you'd never accept this. I'm just too lazy to return it. Avoid this product and get a remote controlled a/v switch."
1,Infomercial for CCBN,Don't be fooled into buying this book. You'll be paying for an infomercial for CCBN and its affiliates. The book is all about how CCBN can help the IRO with IR tasks. There is very little substance besides stating the obvious. These guys must be good at marketing.
1,Dullsville,"If you're fascinated by rowing, you may like this book. By my calculations, that's 0.0002% of us.The author is an experienced reporter in a gritty city. There's definitely the potential for a good read. Just think what Edna Buchanan did with similar credentials!!I may try one of her others to see if it gets goes anywhere. But this one... Enough rowing already. Boooooorr-rring!"
4,Pretty good,"I was excited to find a new female lead mystery series to start reading...and was a little disappointed. It was a slow read, but got better towards the end, & I'm going to continue on & think positively that they'll get better! She seems like a great author. On a personal note, it bothers me when people/characters drink a lot, & I was particularly bothered that Tess smokes weed, but I guess I'm a little odd-man-out to be bothered by something like that. *shrug*"
2,Very average so-so,"I didn't find anything wonderful about BALTIMORE BLUES. The story unfolded OK and the mystery plot was somewhat satisfying, though not very. But worst of all I disliked the heroine, Tess. She seems to be quite a loser, especially the way she sleeps around. Not my cup of tea."
5,A definite must-read!,"I picked this book up in Baltimore over Christmas, my first visit there. I found Baltimore Blues to be very accurate in its descriptions of the city. Ms. Lippman's style of writing paints a clear, colorful picture of this wonderful city. If you would like to visit Baltimore, but just don't have the opportunity, READ THIS BOOK!!! It's the next best thing!"
2,Good Album,"While not as good as his second album (IF I NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU), this album is a good debut for Kersh. ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" is a great ballad, and ""Let's Do SomeThings Your Daddy Wouldn't Want Us To Do"" is a mischevious sexy number (and I get the feeling a way of life for Mr. Kersh as well) Kersh has a great voice and while this is not a deep album, it is enjoyable -- I like to play it."
2,Facing pages?,"Cute story and pictures, but my beginning reader does not like how the pictures and words are not on the screen together. A display problem?"
5,Great for Beginning Readers,"I have twin three-year-old boys, and this is one of their favorite books. They won't sit through many books, but this one really caught their attention. They memorized the book after two or three readings and love reciting it with me. It is very engaging."
2,Cute,"Bought this for my 5 year old son. He didn't really enjoy it much. Even when I read him the story, I could tell he was disinterested. Maybe it'll work for your child, but for mine, if it doesn't involve transformers or super heroes, he isn't interested. :)"
4,Great album!,"I was expecting a super poppy album, but this turned out to be a solid, slightly-poppy album. The album flows from one song to the next making it a real Album (not an i-Tunes one-to-three hit wonder)"
1,How Stupid this Is,First of all. THis is book is criticizing the turtles! Whoa thanks for ruining our childhood! I mean look at all the cartoon shows there were this author was just jealous because this cartoon was soo popular for children. They had morals and so what aout the violence. I have seen a lot worse. This books should be banned or even burned!
4,Good Stuff!,"Value priced and delivered on time. Contrary to some reviews, the plastic case fits properly and protects the phone. A good buy!"
2,"NOT a horror tale, nor a chiller or thriller!","Just so you know, this novel is NOT a horror story - nor is it a chiller or supernatural kind of story. It is a tale of arctic exploration and the trials and tribulations involved, with some native/Eskimo mysticism thrown in at the end. If you are looking for a horror story (and the title of this novel has probably duped a lot of people) this is NOT the subject of this book. Just wanted to warn you so you don't spend your money on something you think is one thing when in fact it is quite another."
3,Wanted To Like It,"I wanted to like this book, but it was entirely too long and uneventful. While the depiction of the conditions the men face was very well done, the monster (Terror) wasn't used effectively and the ending left a lot more to be desired."
5,ONE MORE THING...,I agree 100% with the 5-star reviews already submitted but would like to add one thing that seems to have been played down a bit: this book is bloody TERRIFYING!
4,Good fiction book,"It 's more a fiction book than historical novel. That been said it is a very good fiction book. So just don't consider everything in the book as real or even close to what really happened.If you liked the issue I greatly recommend the book ""The Worst Journey in the World (Penguin Classics)"" about the Scott'expedition to the south pole. The latter is not a novel but an historical recount by one of expeditionaries-beside part of the actual Scott's diary. Nonetheless a very good sort of novel and I would dare to say an excellent one."
2,Ponderous and Unending,"Like the arctic ice providing the backdrop, this novel is goes on forever. Unlike the ice, it never seems to grab you.I did persevere to the end, so it doesn't get one star, but there were times when I wondered why I was bothering."
1,Things are never so bad but what they can't get worse,"I had never read anything by Dan Simmons. I was drawn to it by the synopsis of the story and the length - I love big thick books. But reading this book was not enjoyable, it was an ordeal. I dragged myself through it to only to have a hideously disappointing ending. What this Captain does, after the Thing on the ice has brutally murdered so many of his men, is outrageous. The story starts out with everything being bad and then they get worse, and worse, and worse. Everyone knows I never lend out my books nor do I ever give them away to anyone. When I finished this book, on a long road trip, I left it in the laundry room of a campground. I couldn't stand to have it around anymore. It disgusted me and I would not read anything else by this author."
3,Some parts are slower than drift ice,"Simmons writes well, but this book was way, way, way too long. At 750 pages, there were many back-stories I could have done without (and did, skimming many parts), and lots of repetitive passages. Chapters jump around between characters and in time, which is a little disconcerting at first, but effective. The pages from the surgeon's ""notebook"" are particularly worthy of skimming once the halfway point is reached. Not quite as exhausting to read as it probably was dragging boats across pack ice, but it was a chore to finish it."
2,"White man bad, other man good","There are some creepy moments, to be sure, and gore, but the overarching narrative is tired and cliched - white man bad, native man good and in perfect harmony with all creation. Talk about seeing things in black and white! Must be nice to live in such simplistic splendor."
4,Fabulous Read,"Amazing story. Makes you think of things you never thought of, in regards to what these men went through in search of the Northwest Passage."
5,Great winter read,This book was riveting from beginning to end. The reader becomes a crew member in this heroic tale of arctic survival and mystic Inuit culture.
1,very disappointing,"Let me start by saying that I may be part of a dwindling majority... I'm a 26 year old christian with old-fashion morals/values. This book started off very promising and I really liked it, however, When i purchased the book I assumed I would be reading a book about a ship in search of the north-west passage, To me, Too much of the book seemed to focus on pointless nudity and homosexuality. I don't have a problem with any of that type of stuff as long as there is a reason for it, In this book there isn't, I like to read intelligent thought provoking authors (judson roberts, stephen lawhead, valerio massimo manfredi). I'm only writing this review to let adults/fellow christians avoid wasting their hard earned money."
3,Not bad. But more detail than I needed.,"I enjoyed the book, but there was too much detail and redundancy. Because there are soo many characters, I can see why the author felt it was necessary to recap all the people who had died, on several occasions, but I would have liked it more if the story kept moving along. Also, some readers may like getting to know the intimate details of many characters lives, but I just want the story to keep moving. I could have done without the surgeon's diary entries, among other things. Overall, it was good enough that I got through the whole book, but it was not scary....at all."
1,Too prejudiced,I had to stop reading this book. Its portrayal of Middle Eastern people was so stereotypically prejudiced. Definitely dated and annoying.
5,Excellent quality,Bob's Red Mill gluten is consistent and of excellent quality compared to other vital wheat gluten's I have tried.
4,Not bad zoom,"This is a nice zoom lens- Manual focus is smooth. The only drawback is the zoom- at first it was stiff, but seems to have loosened up through use."
3,Not impressed,"This thing is supposed to be an upgrade from that lame wire that you get with your stereo/receiver. I can't say it's any better. I plugged it in, and while it's nice to be able to sit this somewhere or bolt it to a wall, I did not notice any improvement in performance or improvement it it's ability to pull in FM stations. We still get static, etc."
4,Nice Antenna,"This antenna works better than the one that came with my receiver. Simple to install, and connects securely to the FM coax port. No more folded dipoles! I would strongly recommend this."
3,Unconvinced,"A few months ago I moved to a new apartment - less than five blocks away from my old one. The radio reception in my new location as I discovered though was terrible! Who knew a few blocks would make such a difference?! I looked around at a few different options. I wasn't willing to spend a ton of money because I really don't listen to the radio all that much. Although I had not previously heard of Terk, they seemed to have a good reputation. I settled on the FM+ Indoor FM Antenna for both its price and the Terk reputation. While it may be slightly better than the flimsy contraption that came with my tuner, I didn't find it to be the savior I had hoped for. I still can't get in the station I really want and some others are hit and miss (I was able to tune in these stations at my old apartment). Perhaps I'm just living in a bad area for reception."
1,Not a good unit if your looking to get better reception on FM stations,"just use the dipole that comes with your receiver its the same result.. gotta spend a lot more to get better reception. I wanted a station that I got originally but just had more static, this unit got the same if not worse reception than the regular dipole antenna.Overall wouldn't recommend it to someone that already had an antenna but more for someone who needs 1 and only listens to the easier to get stations in the area."
2,Better looking than wire dipole,It gets no better reception than a twin lead dipole antenna but it looks better and allows more flexible placement.
1,did not work for me,Was having trouble with fm reception using the single wire that came with a sony surround sound receiver. This made it a bit worse. I returned it.
2,Not that great...,"I bought this hoping to get more stations in our warehouse. As it turns out, it did not help at all on most including the one that I can't get. If anything, it does the same as the wire that came with the system. A waste of money."
1,Keep Your Dipole,I tried it with a Sangean WR-11 AM/FM radio. Did not improve reception (metro Los Amgeles high rise office building). The wire dipole antenna actually works better. I am wondering whether the device has any functionality.
2,Maybe it works but not at my location,I live in a small town in the Catskill Mountains in NYS where radio recption is not the best. The antenna has not made a difference and my reception is as poor as it was before.
2,Not worth it.,This product doesn't do anything that a basic Dipole antenna does. I hooked it up and actually found my signal quality to be worse.
1,Worse Reception than a Kid Dressed in Tin Foil,"This product simply does not work!I received better reception from my receiver without the use of an antenna.I tried to connect this using both the dual wire method and the provided cable jack. Nothing!I do live in a condo with mostly concrete walls, but when the product is placed by the window, the reception still does not improve.This product only gets 1 star because I can't give it 0."
1,Don't waste your money,I received this item today and I was really dissapointed. For that price all I got was a piece of junk probably made in China with cheap plastic materials. Some of the parts arrived broken and one just came unglued when I touched it. Don't waste your money. Thank God I got crazy glue.
3,really disappointed,The program runs slow when switching between Atajo and your word processor. It has the ability to enter special accent characters into your word document but not into the Atajo search box which is frustrating. Not all words have the audible pronunciation. I would have liked to have more examples of words in sentences. I would not pay the $80+. It's worth $20 tops.
3,Love the local color.,"This story was not up to par with other Lippman work, but I still enjoyed it. I love the Baltimore setting."
5,Simply Elegant.,"I own this beautiful wine decanter and it is truly elegant. A beautiful addition to any home.I do however wish to correct a comment you made about Gordon Ramsay being knighted by the Queen of England. Queen Elizabeth the second, is the Queen of the United Kingdom and not the Queen of England. She reigns over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition, she is also Queen of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to name a few.I do however give you five stars for having this beautiful decanter for sale and would recommend it to anyone! I own it and I'm buying one for a house warming gift."
1,Jerry Wallace on Helium,"I listened to the sample (thankfully) given here. The previous reviewer is correct -- Jerry Wallace has not been mixed properly here. This recording must have been made by chipmunks trying to mimmick his style.A lot of this goes on .... is there nothing sacred about our musical heritage? The first reviewer should be thankful he got a cassette copy, probably made before this blasphemous remix."
1,A Very Talented Singer... A Very Untalented Recording Engineer,"I'm glad I listened to the sample songs, Primrose Lane and In The Misty Moonlight, before ordering this CD. Because what I heard on these samples is NOT what I heard on the radio back when they were originally released.Some of the other reviewers said that Jerry's voice has been speeded up and raised in pitch, and they were right. And this has ruined the songs for all who want (and should expect) to hear them as they sounded originally. It's too bad that the works of someone so talented were entrusted to someone who wasn't."
3,Not bad,"not a bad book, although it doesnt really show you in detail how to draw them. on each page is a 5 stage walkthrough on how to draw the character, although it sounds good in reality its poor, the poses arnt exciting and the walkthrough is just a bunch of pictures with no text about preportion. there are only 5 or so characters to draw and the book is short but none the less fun to draw."
3,Magical Realism destroys Another Novel,"Let's face facts, magical realism has run its course and now most of what is published is just not up to par -- so many good writers turn their prose into mush by writing the magical realist drivel that they believe their readers still want. Aside from the works of Gabriel Garcia Marguez and a handful of other authors, most writers just can't pull it off."
5,Amazing Band,"Just got home from seeing this band live at the Palladium in Worchester, MA. Absolutely amazing, they just get better with age."
2,Success doesn't always bring good things...,"From the opening chords of this album, there is a feeling that Isaak is going through the motions. The incredible power and simplicity of ""Forever Blue,"" and the laid-back rock style of ""Speak of the Devil"" have been replaced by insincere attempts to get chart recognition, and Isaak's usually perfect instrumentation is blurred together in a mass of over-production. In addition, there doesn't seem to be anything new here, as most of the tunes and chord progressions have been used by him before. This album certainly isn't awful, but it's a surprisingly mediocre album from a musician who has, until now, always been sincere and original."
1,Crappy quality,"Comfy, look good, but straps broke in under six months on three pairs so far. Very disappointed and will be looking for other alternatives that last better."
2,Quality Declining,"I work on the water & for the past decade, these thongs have been my shoe of choice, but over the past couple of years I have noticed quality of construction declining. Whereas I could usually get 8 or so months of wear out of them before the toe leather snapped, the last three pairs I've owned have all lasted only a matter of weeks before the side snaps. Because I travel a great deal,I usually buy 4 pairs at a time once a year. After my recent discovery of the Colombia Tango Thong, which actually comes in a size 15, & is very well made & extremely comfortable, I can happily say that I doubt I'll ever buy another pair of Sperrys again!"
2,Stranded on an Island,"I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery. I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing. The characters were one-dimensional. After discovering who the ""bad guys"" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification. Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters. ""...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."" Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted. I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little."
2,A REAL LETDOWN FROM HER EARLIER WORKS,WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUE HENRY? THIS BOOK IS SUCH A LET DOWN; I ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD SOMEONE ELSE WRITE IT -- THE STORY IS FLAT AND THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES ARE CONFUSING. SORRY TO SAY THAT I REALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS EVEN THOUGH I WANTED TO.
3,"Buy it for ""Machine Gun""","Hubert Kah's music is sort of a strange combination of 1980s pop with 1980s depression. EVen the happy-sounding ""Machine Gun"" isn't very happy once you listen to the lyrics. In this Gen Xer's opinion, it's the album's only saving grace, although ""Military Drums"" is worth a listen."
3,"Good Composition, Terrible Recording","Simply put, this excellent composition of contemporary piano is almost ruined by a mono (or so it sounds), and very weak recording.Captured during a live recording in Japan, the music lives up to it's title, concentrating on deep, dissonant tones from the bottom end of the piano. Trippett really captures a feel of darkess and gloom with his playing. But sadly, the recording sounds as if someone about 100 feet away with a tape deck recorded it. The recording sounds mono, and much of the music, especially when moving, suffers from bad phase cancellation and a general poor recording, and that's really too bad, as this could have been a great work.Best advice: Listen to the audio clip. If you like the music, the rest of the CD is like this. But the weak sound is only a slightly inferior sound quality as what's on the CD."
1,never got it,I was disappointed that I didn't get this book at all - in fact I still have six dollars left on a gift coupon because they took money off of my bank card for the shipping and I don't think they reimbursed that back off my credit card. I was looking forward to using that book but I can't say I was pleased with the shop that doesn't keep more timely records of their inventory
2,It could have been a contender.,"This novel is ruined by its terrible writing style. While novelisations of movies are rarely very good, the style of the writing can often make them enjoyable (for example, Donald McFarlan's novelisation of the 1995 film Rob Roy). While entertaining enough, this book is not very memorable. Kilworth could have told a great story, one perhaps even to surpass the movie (it has happened before), but as it stands it is only adequate and mildly interesting (and then probably only to ""true"" Highlander fans)."
5,"When in Rome, or Rio, or Riyadh...","There were places in this book where I laughed out loud, usually at the real-life examples of ""culture clashes."" The letters also made me think about how my own behavior at work could be misunderstood by foreigners. I learned a lot!"
1,"Not only dull, but possibly dangerous","As previous reviewers have mentioned, this book does not contain much substance. It consists of 8 pages. On each page there is simply one character or object from the story and the name of that character/object underneath it. The illustrations are nothing fancy, and considering the other high quality cloth books out there (like all of the Priddy books) it is not worth it.To be fair, I do not know whether or not my child likes it because I will not let him near it. The book has a very strong odor of whatever chemical they used for the pictures. The book does not come with washing instructions, but since most cloth books are surface wash only, I do not want my child chewing on what could be a potentially dangerous chemical! Beware!"
1,NOT GARY'S USUAL HELPFUL FARE,"I expected a lot more from this book. It's title proffered so much insight, but in reality it falls very short on help. It's more a tirade on the pharmacuetical industry than a self-help book. It proves confusing for those readers looking for guidance. I'm not sure that the investment of time required to read it is worth enough. It can be a difficult read. Other titles by Gary Null are wonderful. The typos were surprising as well."
3,It is what it is I suppose.,Its a book of fairy tales. While the author tried to add a personal touch it did not really improve them any.
1,One of the worse games I have played.,"If I still had it I would just give it away free. It literally made me dizzy. It reminds me more of doom where as you cannot see the player. For me, it was not good at all but for you Doom lovers it will be a great add to your collection."
1,Boring,"Puzzle after puzzle after puzzle with very little action or story. The graphics are from the last century and still too much for my xbox from time to time. Most boring game ever. I usually play all games to the end, but this one I had to stop in the middle to avoid death from boredom."
3,bad mix,a fps game is not fun with puzzle on the way.defenlity this game is another bad mix od nothing.COD2 still the best
2,Boring....,"Not as great as it was hyped up to be. The game is pretty repetitive, and short. Multiplayer is not enticing at all. May be worth renting but not worth buying."
3,Good for the price,"The game was a bit repetitive. I'm glad I didn't pay $50 for it; however, it was well worth $8. For this price, I would recommend to everyone, except children that is."
4,I Love My Roboraptor,The Roboraptor hasn't broken yet. I love it because of the sensors in its head. I like it when you press the button on the roof of his mouth. He makes lots of neat sounds. I got him for Christmas. I think you should get one too. (As written by his father.)
4,Nice TOY ! It's not a real Robot,"Anyone who thinks that they can buy a true robot with true artificial intelligence learning capabilities for $100 needs to rethink buying this.THIS IS A TOY. It walks (waddles fine) on my hardwood floors. How do you expect a $100 TOY to walk? Toys do not have balance they can't walk like us, or an animal. They have to waddle!Me and my now 7 yr old son has had a blast with this. When we got it for him for Christmas the roboraptor was almost the same size as my son. He has learned how to control the robot and have it to scare people of all ages. He will hide it where someone will be sitting and then have it roar.Just an update, 95% of the toys on the market uses a lot of batteries. And when I was younger it said on the box, ""Batteries Not Included."" as with most toys today.No it's not a real robot but it is a pretty fun toy! He has enjoyed it very much."
5,great tool,"The ""No Fear Shakespeare"" books are so much help. I am terrible with understanding old-english and this book makes it an easy-read with helpful hints when the author attempts so allude to something most audiences don't know."
1,Avoid this book,This book was poorly written and not at all funny. Basically it's a vanity piece about the author's (not at all interesting) sex life. The writing is dull and amateurish. There is no story or message and certainly no humor. I usually pass books on after I read them. I threw this one out.
4,Real writing talent and gobs of humor.,"There are two things that set this memoir apart from many others I've read: humor and real writing talent. That is not to say that I haven't enjoyed a lot of memoirs, several by musicians, it is just to say that MORE TOWELS has more to offer, for my tastes at least. HOLLYWOOD ANIMAL really failed to make me care, and Sting's book was interesting but not entirely engaging. Like most people's lives, memoirs often lack a traditional arc, and this is true of More Towels, but Jarrett has natural writing skill and a fantastic sense of humor, and he is so self-deprecating that, between laughs, you find yourself rooting for him. My only complaint about the book is that we have no idea how he made the leap from musician to writer. There are at least ten years unaccounted for. In spite of that minor glitch, I loved the book and recommend it highly."
5,"Finally, a no-bu#$$%^t memoir.","I am an avid reader, and I particularly enjoy good memoirs and biographies, but I have been frustrated repeatedly by writers who gloss over the experiences that embarrass them and focus on those they're proud of. Grant Jarrett gains you sympathy through honesty and a fantastic sense of humor. He shares the worst of himself without apology and laughs at himself as the reader does. He has a breezy writing style that is perfect for the material and yet he can make you feel for him and some of his ""victims"" when he wants to. I'd love to see more from this skilled author."
2,small problems,delivery was fine but they sent me the 100-300mm instead of the 75-300mmthat was kindof a bummer and they didnt call me and ask first.i just kept it and delt with it.
4,"Nice lens, cheap price","The lens takes good pictures and gets very close. Make sure your camera has an internal focus motor if you want this lens, otherwise you will have to manually focus it. I didn't realize that until after I got it but still is a very nice lens."
2,review,Just got it. Looks great but the boat is wider than I expected and it seems as if it would be easy to tip while passing.
1,Not satisfied,This educator seems more interested in how she looks and where her hair is then teaching the moves. She does not speak clear and is hesitant in her speech.
4,Great video,This video really helps you concentrate on isolating muscle groups. Can't follow along with everything first time but it is a nice slow and concentrated workout. I alternate this video with my bollywood dance workout video and they complement each other very well.
2,boring,"this dvd is boring in the moves, takes forever to get to the good stuff. They just teach you the moves but not a routine and break the steps up from there and put them all together at the end. It needs to be more like that"
5,Just What I Needed,"I wanted to learn Belly Dance, but I am not the greatest dancer or the most coordinated. This one is exactly what I needed to learn and develop my skills. She is patient, has a great personality and is able to teach things clearly in an easy to understand way, including using some things we are familiar with to explain how the movements feel.It is broken down with easier moves on the first levels then adds more to it, before doing the longer dances. She is an amazing dancer and her final performance on the DVD is something I hope to be able to do one day - it is easy to see why she is well known in the Belly Dance teaching and performance communities."
4,GREAT video for a beginner,"This video would be great for anyone new to belly dance. Leila does a good job of explaining things and she starts with the most basic elements of belly dance. However, if you are an intermediate dancer, skip this one. It will be too easy for you. There are two major cons to this DVD. First con is that you can't just play the whole DVD through. You have to play each segment separately from the menu page. Second con is that the dance along choreography bits have no instruction. I think you are just supposed to watch Leila and try to dance along. There is no breakdown of combination or even cuing as to what moves are being done. Good beginning video, especially given the price."
3,Greaat for technique,"This is a good DVD for getting down the technique. It isn't as fun as my other DVDs so I don't watch it much. However, any time I need to hone my skills or break down a move, this is a great thing to have in the library."
5,In a word AMAZING,This book was an excellent source of information pertaining to forensic science. It got my interest up again and I am now entering university with the hopes of becoming a forensic pathologist. I liked how Barrett used real cases and real people to explain forensics. I could not put this book down and although it was disturbing in places I thought it was great. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in forensics and who has a strong stomach!
5,Armchair smiles,"Megan's newest book is the perfect read for an evening in a big armchair, perhaps surrounded by photos of your loved ones. Her stories bring to mind personal stories of my own family and inspire me to do some exploration of my own roots. Her writing is accessible, engaging and interesting. Great old photos too!"
2,disappointing,"Cheery, self congraulatory, anecdotal and upbeat but ultimately disappointing. We've been promised that a cure for cancer was on the horizon for the last 50 years. In spite of its hopeful title, this is more of the same. Yes, some cancers can be treated that were once untreatable but more children and adults than ever are getting cancer and dying from it."
1,"Poor Quality, Doesn't Last","This item worked well for the first couple months after which point it stopped working at all. The charging indicator stays lit, but no power reaches the Zen. Seems to have burnt out. Then again, what do you expect from such a cheap device."
5,good buy,great purchase works like a dream. charges quick only problem is the red light gets annoying but just throw something over it and it will be fine
5,Cool useful charger,"I bought it at the same time I bought my ZEN Vision M because of all the good reviews it has but still I wasn't totally not convince I did good, now I know I did great because it truly charges your ZEN fast (haven't time it yet but I guess its bit more than 1hour, faster than connecting it through usb) and it has this green light that turns on when its well plugged. I used it on 110v and also on 220v so its international too."
1,Do not purchase,"Do not buy this product. If you have a creative zen vision, i recommend buying your charger from creative. This charger will damage the mp3 players circuit board. It does not fit into the charger very well. It is too tight. I highly recommend that you stay away from this product and name brand. Go with creative's charger."
4,MP3 charger,The charger I purchased was just what I needed. But I should have bought one that can plug in the usb as well as the wall
5,Saved my VisionM,"This charger is inexpensive and does what it needs to. I thought my Vision M had died on me like the first one I got, but I found out online that USB charging won't bring a battery back from a complete drain. Which is all that Creative gives you (errggg...). I plugged this in and it charged right up. I was so happy, i do love my Vision M. Anyways, great charger, very cheap, I do wish that I could charge it and have it hooked up to USB but it isn't that big of a deal for the price.Highly recommended."
5,It found them!!,"This is the ultimate product! If you ever, I mean EVER, lose your keys, go to this box and they will be in it. This box finds your keys. Worth any price!"
2,Great product with one flaw,"I've needed to wear these for 10+ years. This is the first open toe type that I've purchased. For me it's not good, putting a regular sock over the top of this type almost always folds it back and the lump of material rubs on my shoe the entire day."
2,bunch of stuff,"I bought this to replace my nautical grooming set that was taken out of a suitcase in an airport. This is nowhere near the product. The case is quality leather, but the manicure set is a bunch of stuff you could pick up at the dollar store that's been painted gold. Save your money, look elsewhere."
5,Look forward to this hurricane...,"This is remarkable. You will be amazed with the material on it. It is very happy, it's alive and even funny at spots. Great guitar riffs with not a slow spot on the entire album! My favorite song is ""Stuck in the Belly' about a pregnant woman waiting to give birth. Here's are some words...""We tried drinking, dancing, walking, sex...all we got were Braxton Hicks, we tried everything to get this child to arrive, we told her that we'd buy her a car the day that she could drive...but in the warmth of the womb you get an excellent deal...private residence including all free meals, just peace and quiet in the uterus, what more could anybody want but this? Stuck in the Belly and she won't come out...9 months gone and we have our doubts...Stuck in the Belly and she'll never come out""Wonderful album!"
5,Best 2-drawer safe I have used!,This 2 drawer safe cabinet is the best one I know of. I have three of them now. And will most likely buy some more soon.
4,Great Fire safe file cabinet....,"This is a great File cabinet for storing important docs. I lover the size and it is pretty secure. I would not say that its theft proof, but it ways a ton and someone really has to want it. The free delivery was great if you are not in any hurry."
2,NOT STRONG ENOUGH.,this thing is for small job only.. it didit work out for me. it was really hard to take 2*4 off with 3 nails in it...
1,"Its a remake, and the original wasn't even that good.","This is a remake with a new title of Urla's NYStyle Pilates dvds and videos released earlier this year on this very site. As a Pilates instructor who studied with Romana it is clear that this is far from the 'real deal' Urla claims it to be on his description. While the settings and actors are 'pretty', the constantly skewed camera angles are distracting as is the music. There are drags on the tape and obvious voice over corrections that add to the distraction of constant cuts of the camera shots. He claims to be a seasoned instructor, who should know that clear and simple makes Pilates easier and more effective. I'm not a big fan of Windsor Pilates, as they look for a shortcut to fitness, but this is the other extreme - too much talking and not enough workout."
5,PECAUT--PERSONAL,"SEARCHING FOR CONTACT. FORMER PIONEER MEMBER,ILL. JO GOODWIN. RESPOND,TO THIS E.MAIL ADD."
3,Alien Smorgusboard,"This book is a wide selection of aliens, mostly a reprint of all the previous aliens published in previous books.As such it's a good reference book, even if a bit dry. The prestige classes are mostly race specific, but are pretty interseting."
2,Punishing,"Chanting, vocalists doing miaowing sounds, guitars being tortured rather than played. The same riff is played over and over. Then it becomes just a drone. Repetitive, the sound of something like an old space invaders machine kicks in for a while to relieve the monotony. Great live band, but I wasn't impressed with this."
3,Best Of?,"Some record company really needs to release a ""BEST OF DEBBY BOONE"" with her hits like CALIFORNIA, END OF THE WORLD, and yes, YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE. This compilation needs to be revised. She deserves at least a true ""best of debby""!"
4,Shocking Expose of Seventh-day Adventist Prophetess,This book is a shocking expose of Seventh-day Adventism's prophetess Ellen White. Walter Rea provides significant documentation revealing Ellen White's plagiaristic activities. This impressive book leaves no doubt as to the massive extent that Mrs. White relied on the writings of other authors for her inspirational books. There is no better documented book dealing with this subject on the market today. A must-read for Seventh-day Adventists and others serious about learning the truth about Ellen White.
1,Disappointing Voice,The songs all have good lyrics but I was disappointed in the vocals. Duke does not have a good emotional voice to match the lyrics and every song sounds the same. No range in his voice and no feeling. No wonder I do not like 707. The replacement singer was better but not enough to convince me to like 707 music. Its the same old eighties boring rock. I bought this cd based on other reviews but I quickly sold the cd after 2 listens.
4,"newsworthy,","Good book. Read about a page, maybe two, and realized I didn't have time to read the whole thing. Liked the idea, though."
3,Starting to warm up,"With trepidation, I delved into Vol 2 after being disappointed by Vol 1. This was better, I think. Issues were dealt with on a more manageable Earthly scale, not stellar. The dull bits were the world tour, touching base with X men all over the world. Not much going on here until they start to put the idea of the Omega Gang. The Xorn character is unbelievably good but the other loser mutants are beginning to develop some personalities."
2,What would I write if I had no clue?,"Stephen Davis does a good job of embellishment in ""Hammer of the Gods"". Through a catchy title and sensational writing Davis has what is unfortunately considered the definitive Led Zeppelin story. Jimmy Page himself said that he threw the book out a window after about the first chapter. This book has it's good points and it undoubtedly has some accurate information, but for the most part it is not worth reading. Remember, it is unauthorized. Davis even tries to quote lyrics from Led Zeppelin songs in the book and gets those wrong. Enough said."
4,"It'll leave you shocked, appalled and enthralled.","Hammer of the Gods is a very enthralling read. It leans more towards the touring career of Led Zeppelin rather than the recording sessions. The account of Zeppelin's wild back-stage antics is fascinating, revealing the band as heavy-drinking womanizers. John Bonham's maniacal partying and Jimmy Page's underage lover are just two of the many unglamourous subjects detailed in this well-written book.Perhaps even more interesting are the exploits of Zeppelin's 2 managers: Richard Cole and Peter Grant. Both intimidating men who never hesitated to resort to violence in order to swing proceedings in the band's favour. The accounts of their dealings make this book worth reading alone."
1,A rip-off from cover to content.,"The commercials presented are, clearly, not the best of their genre. Additionally, there is no explanation, whatsoever, regarding the purpose or content of some of the foreign language commercials. Most aggravating is the fact that the box and the title on the tape indicate a running time of 60 minutes. The tape runs slightly less than 30 minutes. Don't waste your money."
2,quit after 4 months,"I had this on a ""always on"" media machine. We didn't use it much, but it only lasted 4 months. The light won't come on on multiple USB ports, and multiple computers. I downloaded the current software, but it can't see it when I plug it in. My computer sees ""something"", when plugged in, but says there was a error in the installation. It does not show up in my device manager. Did not purchase at Amazon, but is the same model."
1,Repeatedly crashed my computer,I bought this product against my better judgement for the ease of use of a USB adapter. I followed install instructions but it wouldn't find my network. It even gave me the dreaded blue screen when trying to use the repair command under Windows XP. I called D-Link tech support and they told me to install the newer driver which was on their website. That too was quite a process and I'm somewhat tech proficient. After trying to install the driver again I got the blue screen for the 5th time and my patience ran out. This unit is being returned today.
5,Great product,I bought this to provide web access to my kids' computer in the library. I hooked it up fairly quickly with no issues. So far it's worked perfectly. Can't beat the price and it does what it says.
4,D-Link Wireless Excellent Quick Start,I was networking 4 PC's in our home and 2 didn't have wireless network adapters built in because they are older models. Not being real experienced in wireless networks I did a bit of reading to see what I needed and found this item in one of the articles. I was a bit skeptical because it was so cheap but I took a chance anyway and am sooooooooooooo glad I did. Was installed and hooked up to the internet via my wireless router and home networked within 30 minutes. Am planning on buying 1 more so I can get the 4th networked in. It is so nice not to have all those ethernet cables strung thru the house! Good price plus shipping/quick arrival/excellent product. Software easy to use and understand. Would recommend to even a novice! Thanks!
3,Great idea but not well made,"I love the idea of this toy and I had fun building the different structures with my son. When he tried to assemble and disassemble this toy by himself, the pieces easily broke. The sticks and the round circular pieces had cracks and the pieces broke off, so this toy is very cheaply made and can't withstand pressure from little hands. I am disappointed because we really loved this toy for the whole 2 days that the pieces could be used."
4,Understanding Operating Systems,"This text gives perspective to the enormous world of OS. Through distinct organization of discussing each OS manager as well as drawing parallels between manager systems, the reader walks away with a sound understanding. The final chapters address news OS and networking. The exercises at the end of each chapter are especially good with sound application practice. As with any text, thre are a few minor glitches in explanations and computations especially in relation to offset. This is a great Intro to OS text."
1,Not the best presentation of the subject matter,"I'm taking a course in Operating systems, and this is the text book that I was given. I don't know if the material is presented poorly, but this book hasn't help me grasp what are probably the basic concepts. Just as the previous reviewer stated, they are few illustrations to clarify the points made in the book. I also think some real world examples would have helped.This book only touches lightly on Unix. But emphasizes Micosoft OSes a lot."
2,too long to receive,Had oreder this item with the certainity that it would arrive prior to a show opening. It came nearly four weeks later.
3,"Disappointing Follow up, Okay book","As it has been said, Exile did not come close to the realm of Girl. Still I have to admire Nelson for aiming his super-sharp lens on a subject that comes closer to home. I did find many aspects of the book interesting, but it could stand some more shaping. I'm still eagerly awaiting whatever Nelson comes out with next."
2,Not worth the [price],"First of all, for all of you expecting a kind of paperback book for this, expect something more like a ""booklet"". It is very thin, with huge fonts, and doesn't contain much information at all. The whole content of the book can probably fit within half a page on a newspaper. The whistling tips didn't work for me. A couple of stories told in the book were fun to read, and that was about the only positive point of the book. Overall, this ""book"" feels more like a home-made newsletter, made on someone's personal computer and bound by hand. I wouldn't mind paying [price] for something like this, but not [price]."
5,Simple but Clear,"This book is simple and small, but does a great job of teaching how to whistle with your fingers. The diagrams are clear and helpful. This may not be the case in every book, but ours was signed by the author and a couple points were highlighted in pen -- a nice personal touch.Whistling with your fingers is one thing that I never learned as a kid. Turns out to be true for an overwhelming majority of my adult friends as well. I wish I had. Now, we can teach kids this helpful skill."
4,Easy and quick cross stitch gifts!,"I can see why the title is called Weekend Cross-Stitch Gifts since I made a magnet and a book marker within hours! The other projects range from samplers, photo frames, place mats, bread covers, etc. I plan to make several more items from this book."
4,"Works well, with possible reservations","I got one of these for a small, infra-red heater my wife got from her brother in China for therapeutic use. The heater has two ""speeds"", and this device works perfectly at the high setting. But at the low setting, it vibrates, and makes a noise. I'm not really sure if it's the fault of the transformer, exactly. I think the heater is reducing the power by pulsing the power on and off very quickly. I think the heater should have capacitor filtering to smooth out the pulses, and if it did it correctly, it probably would not vibrate."
2,Nice idea......but too complex.,"I love the Harry Potter Series when i saw Harry Potter And The Sorcors's Stone (the PC game) i bought it and loved it when i saw this game i got it but the contents of the game was disappointing. The Lego people can't do anything but bump in to stuff and annoy the stuffing out of you. This game seems like it would be easier for adults,but i'm not sure i do know this though,this game is WAY to hard so for ages 13 and up anyone younger would surly die of being bored."
2,Not for Toddlers,I brought this for a toddler and the contents were reared more toward adults.Not a Disney Junior for sure.
5,Great inexpensive sampler of Steve & Eydie's swingin' best!!,"Steve Lawrence & Eydie Gorme are the swingenest couple and these are thier swinginest sides!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome songs, great jazzy arrangements and perfect voices!!!!"
4,Siegfried & Roy- Master of the Impossible,It was a Good Movie. I bought this Movie for My Husband for Christmas and he Loved it. Thank You Amazon.com. I love the products that you sell.
4,Good mailers for the price.,"These are good for the price. Unlike some polymailers they dont have an address box where you can easily write, but luckily I have address labels. They seem strong and have not ripped or torn anywhere and I've put some heavy stuff in them. I like the size, it's a good medium sized mailer that fits a majority of things I mail, from books to clothing."
5,Absolutely riveting!,"Outstanding! Michelle Leder has done a superior job in providing essential information that all investors, whether novice or experienced, need to know to make an informed choice in selecting stock. This book eliminates the ""intimidation factor"" that potential investors may feel when confronted with heavily footnoted annual reports, and succintly tells the reader where and how to find critical information needed to make sound decisions. An absolute must read for ANYONE even thinking of delving into the stock market."
5,Child Eyes by Rene Albracht,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. The writer kept the interest with her creativity/imagination and skillful writing. She made you feel like you were there watching every moment in these two girls lives. This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. As a new author, Rene Albracht is on her way to becoming one of the best and well known authors in her time. She has a talent in writing that many authors do not. I can't wait to read her next book."
5,Using the Baltic States to Determine Germany's ambitions,"When I first saw this book I was reminded of the Frenchman who, back in the days when Germany was split, said: 'I love Germany. I love Germany so much I'm really glad that there are two of them.'Of course there are not two Germanys any more. And this book studies the question that since Germany is now the great power in Europe how will it use its power. Will it go back to its past aim and attempt to dominate Europe, Or has it renounced its imperial ambitions following the trauma of division during the Cold War?In an attempt to answer this question, Dr. Readman has looked at the situation in the Baltic states, caught between the countries of Russia and Germany, both of which are in a period of turbulent confusion.This book is based on numerous confidential interviews with key political actors and access to still classified material. Profusely referenced, this is a breadthrough book for those interested in the German question."
2,Fun with Mommy and Me: More Tha,Very outdated. Not very many ideas for each age group. Will probably donate to library. Most of the ideas you most likely are already doing. Low creativity.
5,Ray Stevens - very funny,"Who can not enjoy Ray Stevens? A good picker upper for bad moments, or when you just need a good laugh."
2,"Bad Quality, Irritating Music","I loved listening to Robert Anton Wilson. However, the quality of the visuals (with badly done transitions) and the extremely irritating constant music (mostly gloop and bleep noises) made me turn it off half way through.Can somebody who is a professional video editor please re-release this item in better quality?"
4,college book,This book is for college purposes only. Very hard to read but was required for a reading material. Plus was way cheaper to buy from Amazon than the school book store. =)
1,Naive main character,"I did not enjoy this book. It is much to negative and superficial for my taste. I was annoyed at how naive Nia was. Just cursing, sex, and naivety."
4,Not half bad.,"Well, of course it's that hokey romantic type. And, of course you see the ending coming from a mile away. Of course we've seen it all before. But, as far as entertainment value goes, it's got it. Reese Witherspoon proves, once again, that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality. There's really not much to the characters in this movie, but there doesn't need to be. I was a little wary of the Jon Heder character, having just come off the great Napolean Dynamite buzz. But, I found his character interesting and didn't think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out, but he did a good job with what he had. You don't have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one, but it works when you're in the mood for a straightforward romance. It is what it is."
3,good movie,"the movie was in good condition, but it would have been nice if it was in the case it came in"
2,"Good start, terrible ending","This movie starts as a harmless, entertaining blend of fantasy and romantic comedy, but then it takes midway through a turn for the worse. Way worse. Basically, a guy renting an apartment suddenly starts receiving visits from a beautiful ghost (Reese Witherspoon), who doesn't seem to be aware that she's dead and wants him to vacate the place (which previously belonged to her). As it turns out, she isn't dead. She is in coma. So when they realize this, he and she must join forces to prevent the doctors from disconnecting her. Let's just say this movie's take on the euthanasia issue is terribly simplistic. This is a movie where people wake up from a deep coma after a deep kiss. It's that insulting. I wonder what people who had to go through the painful situation of having a loved one in coma might think of this film."
1,I was not able to use it,"I am living in Paris France. Probably due to a difference in systems or whatever, the film did not work on my DVD player.Sorry."
1,Horrible!,"I found this movie insulting. First, it perpetuates the idea that women cannot be fufilled by anything except social success--Elizabeth had a wonderful career but all anyone spoke about was how sad it was that she didn't have a boyfriend. Of course, she is only able to find love when she is incapacitated. Nobody loves a powerful woman! Also, could this movie hit you over the head any harder with its blatant sentiments against the right to die? I mean, jeeze. I don't want to give anything away but there were points when I felt like I was watching a anti-choice propoganda film."
4,"One of the best books I ever read, unless there's a sequel.","The Kidnapping of Courtney Van Allen and What's Her Name tells the story of a girl named Jan who visits her aunt Harry in New York City. While in New York she also meets Coutrney Van Allen, the daughter of a popular TV actress and politician. They are both kidnapped one night by Courtney's mean-spirited nanny and her odd boyfriend who is also Coutrney's psychiatrist. They are taken to an abandoned island where they are joined with the doc's eccentric mother who was once a movie star from the 20s and 30s. Jane and Coutrney launch an escape that almost costs them their lives but gets them home. Besides being hilarious it tells a story of friendship, trust and loyalty. Recommend it to anyone over 11."
5,Amazing talent.. a real must have,This collection is well worth the wait. I have had the opportunity to see the Stringdusters twice in person and was anxiously waiting for the release. I was not disappointed and you won't be either. You should get two - one for you and one to share with a friend.
3,"Great talent, not as impressive as their live show","Originally drawn to these guys after hearing their show in Charlottesville, several of the tracks are excellent, fast-paced bluegrass hits which allow them to demonstrate their talent. Unfortunately, not as many of the songs on the album fit the mold as one would desire. In person, the Stringdusters are amazing to watch and listen to - quite a bit of improv. and ""showing off."" They seem to hold back a bit on the CD."
5,Strong Duets...,Smooth Grooves has issued quite a few compilation CD's over the years and this happens to be one of their better ones. Powerful duets by very powerful singers! This one happens to be great old school Quiet Storm material too! From Teena and Rick to Curtis Mayfield and Linda Clifford! It's rare to find such great duets in one place. It isn't necessary to hit the skip button on this compilation..each song is superb!
3,Know what you're buying...,"I bought this seat tube last week, and wish I had asked more questions before purchase. I'd recommend checking the USABLE length to make sure this will fit your needs. I'm 6' 1"" riding a Specialized Allez Elite compact frame. The seat tube isn't long enough (when set to the ""min insert"" line) for me to get appropriate leg extension in the aero position. That results in a pretty dramatic loss of pedalilng power. i'm going to try to go an inch beyond the mfgr's recommendation to see if that works, but if not, I'm probably stuck with this purchase. Make sure you check this detail with the seller and compare to your current setup before you buy."
3,r.a.w. = keanu reeves . . .,"... in that wilson's books are all about the same things, just like keanu's movie characters are all the same person. still, if you're a keanu fan you like all the infinitesimally varying performances, and if you're a robert anton wilson fan, you don't care how many times he repeats his understanding of the universe.this book is quite well written, quite imaginative.. a lot of fun. but i also wish that it had been a complete trilogy instead of an incomplete one.. argh.. where's ""Son of Illuminatus""?!?!(also, i had a hell of a time finding the book. i've been looking for it for about three years and finally found it secondhand. reprint all raw!)"
1,Would be fun if...,"I hear this game can be great. However, the developers have all but stopped supporting it. Go read the technical forum at myfreedomforce.com. The latest NVIDIA drivers arent compatible with the game. I can't get the game to work for more than a minute at a time. There are dozens of others like me, and the tech support people are ignoring all pleas for help.I completely wasted my money on this title. Don't waste yours."
2,"Good concept, glitchy and hastily released software","If you're looking to buy this game to actually use multiplayer, I'd see if you can rent it first (some video stores do) or check out the official website's message board and just take a look at the technical problems/questions string. You have about a 25% chance of multiplayer actually working, even if you have a top of the line system (I three different computers, all P3s or better with top of the line video cards.) I got Jedi Knight 2 the same day, and every aspect of that game works perfectly. So BUYER BEWARE"
1,Upsetting,"This game really upset me. I was looking forward to playing it and the game had some stupid qlitch in it that made it unable to start once I installed it. BUYER BEWARE! I could not find help for the problem and so I sold the game. I also read other reviews that the game is good but no real multiplayer, unless you like only one on one battles and no real replayability, I would wait for something better that you can play again and again and it be a new adventure every time. P.S.- Star Wars Galaxies RPG online- check out the reviews! its not superhero but its better than that... super space heros online."
1,Too Good to be True,"The retractable cord broke in less than two weeks. Though it is convenient to have a usb cord that can plug into a standard socket or car cigarrette lighter. But, if the retractable breaks, the convenience of transporting the cord is lost and the main reason that I bought the product. I would not recommend this at all."
5,Magnetic Knife Bar,"Very good quality. The magnet holds the knives securely, but you can remove them with with ease. Would recommend it."
5,magnetic knife holder,This is a great product. Keeps knives handy and out of the way at the same time.
3,Chris Coco - Next Wave,"Chris Coco ventures out with Next Wave, which starts of promisingly enough with ""Falling (G1)."" It transposes Satie's ""Gymnopedies"" into an ambient dub setting, though that has as much to do with Satie as it does with Coco. The album continues in a slow drift of ambience -- be sure you're lying down in a comfortable position before listening. Tracks like ""Hazy Lazy"" give that dreamy quality a little kick drum. There certainly is an Ibiza vibe running through the album, and I think that it hampers the music somewhat, since Coco seems consciously trying to conform his music to the norm. Even his more recent albums as Coco Steel and Lovebomb didn't follow Ibiza as much as they were simply played in Ibiza. The hype seems to have gotten to him, but he still manages a decent album."
2,Only 1 worked,"I had the exact same experience as another reviewer - only 50% worked. Feature-wise, they seemed great. I really liked the front-load battery.I got one fully installed, and that was a breeze. The second one, I mounted the plate, but when I closed the battery door, it intermittently beeped. I replaced the battery it came with using one of my own batteries since it sounded like a low-battery alert. It continued intermittently beeping for a few minutes, and then went into full alarm.I did buy these through the Amazon warehouse, and the package had clearly been opened previously. They also came without screws, annoying but I have lots of screws. I do need 2 smoke alarms that work, so back they go. Amazon was great about the return, and they're sitting out waiting for my mail carrier to pick them up. I'm hesitant to get them again, even not through the warehouse."
2,Get the Citizen JQ8006-53E instead,"I am a Casio digital watch person - always have been. I wanted a more quality watch so I thought this would do. HME got it here quickly. I sent it back quickly.The main problem is that the digital display is very faint and not like the picture at all. In direct sunlight it may look like the picture if you are at the perfect angle as well. The second problem is that there is no backlight. Finally, the design is over the top. The buttons have orange on them. When you put the watch on, the back of the strap shows in orange. The watch has plastic inserts in the band to keep it in the middle of your wrist, however this thickens the band to much IMO.I did find the perfect watch though: the Citizen JQ8006-53E. It DOES HAVE A LIGHT on the digital portion. Also, the digital portion is more visible in ambient light. It sells for $180.00."
4,Wonderful real Chinese recipes,"I used to think that Chinese food was all about sweet and sour pork and chicken chow mein. I've learned a lot since then.This cookbook has the recipes for some of my favorite dishes. The pork belly with mustard greens is my all-time favorite because of the delicious, custard smooth layer of fat and the balance between the mustard greens and the ""bacon.""The directions are sometimes a bit vague, but the ingredients list is pretty clear; it's also written in traditional Chinese characters, so I usually take it with me to the grocery store to make sure I'm buying the right items. Translations are not in Pin Yin, but they're phonetic so you can attempt to explain what you're looking for to the grocery clerks.I try a new dish from this book every week, and I've yet to be disappointed. Now, if they only could come out with a video..."
5,Fun Sesame Street Movie!,I have an older autistic child that just loves Elmo. This is one of the more entertaining Elmo movies for kids and adults. Tons of good musical numbers from several years of Sesame Street. Thank you Elmo for entertaining my children and letting me get some other things done.
3,Basic,"It's loud, and you can't adjust the volume. It doesn't have as many functions as some of the other ones. If you're looking for a very basic metronome, I guess it will suffice."
3,I need it for class,"I actually just bought it for one song. I need it for my class. It is ok, not my favorite though.."
5,a wonderful gift,"I am SO EXCITED that this book is back in print - it was a terrifically magical part of my childhood, and I look forward to sharing it with another generation of children. The illustrations are charming, and the story is simple enough to be memorized by small children, but not so simple that it loses its charm."
4,hop-up system check,"Just wondering if the gun had a hop up system. just for the dorks who don't know what hop up is, it spins the BB to make it shoot farther and more accurately. I am giving it 4 stars because I don't own it."
3,Good idea - Bad Execution,"It is the same type of game as Never Winter Nights, Bards Tale, Dungeon Siege etc.. You are stuck in one view and can only zoom in and out.. No 360 degree viewing. A step back in RPG evolution."
5,Lobo - Greatest Hits,"Lobo probably never received the recognition he deserved, but those of us who love and identify with his music give him nothing but high marks. It brought back a lot of memories from the mid 1970's for me. It contains the familiar songs ""I'd Love You to Want Me"" and ""Me and You and a Dog Named Boo"", plus some lesser known but equally good songs like ""How Can I Tell Her"", ""Way I Came In"", and ""Don't Expect Me to Be Your Friend"". If you love the music from the first half of the 1970's, this CD needs to be a part of your collection. It is highly recommended!"
4,"Animal Manners, By Barbara Hazen","This beautifully illustrated hardcover has many many great srories of animals acting like humans in many different kinds of situations. This book is great to read to little children who love animals, It will teach them on behaving, learning to share and many other situations they will see in life. 28 different silly stories with many different kinds of animals living the lives of people in there situations. Very funny and eduacational for the little learner. My favorite was Welcome Ricky Racoon, Who when came to play helped but the toys away, and was always careful with scissors and glue, and all his friends wanted him to come over."
1,Disappointing Book,Much of the text is extracted from Data Sheets and Application Notes. The authors do not give the impression that they have ever built anything.
5,Great Show,This is one of my favorite shows. The ONLY drawback is that there are not enough episodes. Each one makes me want to travel to that location.
