4,"Nice Picture, Good Value, but it's not a Viewsonic","This monitor has a nice picture, very flat screen, and great colors, and appears to be of good quality. It's a great buy if you're looking for a reasonably priced monitor.However, I do have a few complaints. The screen has those infamous trinitron lines (even though it's not a trinitron), one at about 20% from the bottom, and another at 20% from the top. I have a friend who bought the exact same model, same with his. The dot pitch claims to be a variable .25-.27, although judging by the clarity of picture, I'm scepticle to believe it, it's not the sharpest picture. It makes an excellent gaming monitor, but if you're into imaging or reading lines of text all day long, you might want to spend a little more dough.Bottom line: If you're on a budget and you want a decent, good quality flat screen, it's a great choice. If you want Viewsonic or Trinitron picture quality, spend the extra cash to get one and you'll appreciate the difference."
3,DVD is a drawback,"Informative book. However, it would be nice if the evaluation copy of ENCASE actually allowed you to complete the exercises located within the accompanying book.Luckily, I am using the book for a graduate class at a school that has a full working copy of ENCASE."
3,For EnCe Certification,"This book was written to help Forensics Technicians achieve the Guidance software's EnCE Certification. Since Encase software comes with a user's guide which is basically printouts of the help from within the program and it is as useless as a priest after a wedding, This ""guide"" can also be used as a documentation on how to use the Encase forensics software.If used for the above purposes, you will get your money's worth, however if you thing you will learn investigative techniques and best way to Forensically archive a digital device This is not the book for you. It is very single minded for example it does not count on criminals using Grub instead of MBR.I gave it a 3 star since it did help me pass both phase one and two of Encase certification and awarded me with an official looking certificate which is now hanging in my office.Best fishes and Thank you for reading."
1,Most Disappointing Product I've EVER Purchased!,"Right off the bat, let me say that this Grundig CD player isn't worth [money], let alone [money]. The reviewer that said he got 5 hours of listening on a set of batteries is lucky. With the first set, I got 1 hour, with the second set I got 14 minutes!! I'm not exaggerating -- I timed it.Granted, you can skip the batteries and use the AC adapter, but even then, the sound quality is terrible. Cheap and tinny. The speakers are worthless. I am astonished that Grundig is charging so much money for this. Do yourself a favor and avoid."
1,Do not buy this Thing called a Radio,"I have rarely been so dissapointed as I was when I received this thing (I hesitate to call it a radio.) I live in Australia and do a bit of international travel. I wanted a travelling radio (AM in particular)that also plays my CD/MP3's. Read the info, and it states in the manual and ON THE UNIT that it is both European and USA frequency compatible in the AM band. NOT TRUE! The US version is US and the European version is European only. So yes it is a travelling radio, it just doesnn't like to travel far!The MP3's that I played on the unit, skipped within the tracks, sigh. The keys to set the time/date were hypersensitive and skipped randomly between functions. Yuck.Not even worth considering (or spending more time on writing this review)"
2,Fine While it Lasted,"I purchased mine in August 2004 and it is dead as of August 2006. For travel, while it worked, it was fine; I loved the sleep function, the sound was OK although I chose to use portable speakers with it. But it started behaving peculiarly about six months ago, not starting right up at times. Considering the price and the brand name, this portable player should have had a longer lifespan."
3,"20"" Viewable Monitor not 22""","I thought I was getting a 22"". It is only 20"" viewable, they all are regardless of brand. I hope the monitor does not break down."
4,A very funny tragedy,"Why is this book out of print? It's a sad and funny look at (Navy) life, as seen by three sailors ""On The Town,"" with the ghost of the Nuremburg trials dogging their steps. See the movie, read the book, if you can find it."
5,One of the most spectacular new things Elton tried,"Overall a beautiful CD. Elton is great in trying out new things. Especially the songs ""Written in the stars"", ""A Step too far"", ""Elaborate lives"",""How I know you"" and ""The Messenger"" have a great vibrant voice. Elton's voice gets fuller and sexier with age, I think, and I can't wait until AIDA is going to be seen on Braodway."
5,Excellent - Best CD I've listened to in quite awhile,"This CD is amazing - It will haunt your soul. My personal favorite is the Tina Turner song - ""Easy As Life."" She brings a soulful and sexy quality to a simply phenomenol performance that will transport you out of this world. She hits every chord just right and really gets to the emotion of this tragic tune. I also truly enjoyed all of Elton John's duets with Leann Rhimes, Janet Jackson and the two female performers from the stage show. The Boyz II Men and James Taylor tracks are also hauntingly beautiful. This one's worth buying."
4,Good...but not as good as the show!,"I bought this CD when it first came out, and I immediately loved it. I just knew the show was going to be great. When I finally did get to the see the show in Chicago, I fell in love with the music all over again. For those who are considering buying this CD, however, I suggest you wait until the cast recording comes out...not that this is a bad CD...it's just that the music for the actual show is EVEN BETTER!"
1,Disappointing,"After seeing all the 5 star reviews, I'm going to have to go back and listen to this album again. I've been an EJ fan since 1970, but thought that this was about the worst product I'd ever heard him release."
4,"Good, but lacking compared to the cast performance","This soundtrack for AIDA was good, but I would have preferred it if Elton John and the Disney crew released a cast recording of the songs. For those of you whom haven't seen the stage production, it is VERY good; if you think the songs performed by the famous artists featured on this CD are good, you will be blown away by the cast performances. Perhaps when AIDA makes it to Broadway (my fingers are crossed), Elton will release the cast recording."
2,"Fun read, but take heed...","I love the Rich Dad books because they're motivational as well as interesting, but there has to be a word or two of caution.Concerning incorporating properties...this seems rather specious. You don't have to go to the trouble of incorporating each property to keep the fear of having personal assets taken through a liability claim; that's why you carry insurance, and a lot. A big policy is more than sufficient, and most courts will not allow lawsuits from taking your primary home.Time being money, it's much faster and easier to sign a policy than to do the tedious and never-ending paperwork to incorporate a property. There may be rare circumstances when you would (a real estate lawyer is worth the consultation) but for 99.9999999% of the people in the world, No."
4,Good information,Although the author is pushing his own service (nothing wrong with that) there's lots of good information here. I bought this to do research for a client. Ordinarily I wouldn't have bought it for my own reading. But I found lots of useful information in here. I learned a lot about incorporating that I didn't know and will find it useful not only for my client but for myself as well.
5,Merovingian myths,This was a great book . I enjoyed reading this book. A lot of twist and turns . Very informative.
5,sesame snap tip,"In common with many other readers I have found this title to be really useful and after a brief period of re-organisation of my working practices, I've entered a more productive and useful faze of my life. Using the powerful techniques of in-box, breaking tasks down and especially the 2 minute rule as part of the easy to use system that dave allen has designed, I now run my home baking business far more productively than ever before.As a diabetic, and a baker I've also developed some additional blood sugar micro-management techniques that mesh well with Dave's great system. There's just no point in being on top of everything unless you've the energy and more importantly the correct level of available blood sugar to follow through with prompt and effective action. I recommend sesame snaps as a light weight alternative to help ensure that potential productivity gains are realised with a health giving and nutritional micro-meal."
3,Getting things done while staying awake,"The audio cassette is a wonderful way to digest this worthwhile information. It offers plenty of helpful tools and methods for improving productivity, regardless of your line of work. The only problem is in the author's verbal delivery of the material. He seems to read word for word in a very hypnotic manner, rather than being lively to make the subject matter seem highly interesting."
3,Good Information For Those New To The Subject,"I'm glad I bought the condensed version (audio download) of this, because the information presented is the same information given those of us who first learned to multi-task and otherwise become insanely effective twenty-five years ago with Stephen Covey.It's great, valid material . . . if you haven't already read or otherwise obtained productivity information elsewhere. If you're an old hand at this and are looking for something new, however, you won't find it here.And even for those who are clueless about organization, productivity, attaining goals, etc., I recommend the abridged version. I've flipped through the book at Border's, and there appears to be a lot of repitition, unnecessary filler, and other padding that isn't necessary. Anyone with half a brain (and if you're reading this, I'm sure that's you) can figure out how to set up a workable program from the condensed version."
5,A great self-help book for those who want to knock off one of their new year resolutions,"This is a great book. I was skeptical of these self-help books but after I got it as a gift for the new year last year, I found it to be very helpful in changing the way I handle my work. I found myself happier and less stressed and having more free time from the advice in this book. Well worth it!"
1,"Well, if you dont know what a list is","Seriously? The advise here appear to be - in my opinion, ""make a list, review the list, do whats on the list."" Um, yeah, I got that part."
2,"I'm sorry, I just didn't get why everyone else likes this book","After just finishing this book I felt I a bit confused. This book should have had some great ideas that just bounced off the pages but it was disjointed, scattered and difficult. Not the concepts, they were quite basic and intuitive, but the way the book was written just feels extremely heavy. I had a hard time focusing on what the author's points were and lost interest quickly. I was looking forward to this book but left very disappointed."
5,"Leading Edge, yet simple, practices",David Allen's work is simple to understand and profound in its' application to all facets of living life. I have found a source of wisdom to help guide me through my day to day activities while being able to keep my focus on what's most important to me in the bigger picture. I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to get out in front of the activities that make their life what it is. This work will put you in control of your personal and professional life. I can also see this being a valuable tool for students.
4,getting things done,"David Allen did a good job. He guides the reader with important princples to complete a task. From the simplest task to the most complex projects, the principles are straightforward applicable."
3,Friends don't let friends read their own books,"I get books on tape for two reasons. The second reason is, after a day of working at a computer, my eyes don't want to look at anything. But the first reason is that I listen to books on tape to keep me awake while driving. So I need a good, engaging reader. This is the first time I've ever had to eject a CD while driving. The CD was putting me to sleep. I only go through half of the first CD, so I really don't know about his program. But he reads in a boring monotone that reminds me of lecturers from the 50's. He may be brilliant, but I'll never know."
3,Helpful Read,"This book was helpful when I read it with a few organizational items in my life. It's been a while since I've read it, and I can't exactly remember what I learned so I've given it a 3/5."
3,Good to get organized,"This book is good if you need to get organized in your life, be it at home or at work."
4,Good,This is a good book on how to prioritise your tasks by keeping the list and deadlines.Somehow he talks about in-files and out-files - but that is a minor distraction in this e-age.
3,Too difficult to follow.....,"Really, this book makes it sound difficult to stay organized and get things done! Too much jumping around and difficult to read."
2,Just another audio CD..,"I found this CD set to be somewhat of a dry, lengthy production with little information we don't know already. He talks about how to arrange your workstation for optimal productivity- which is a process we all go through to get things done efficiently. If you are new to the workplace with no experience at all on how to get things done and optimize your workspace, then this book is for you. If you already are a professional, don't expect to find any new ideas here."
4,Writing it all down,Basically his theory of getting organized is putting all pertinent info into folders which are labeled. He also is adamant about making lists and writing down all information from your head so you can feel in control and be able to sleep at night.
2,Best for organized people with independent projects,"GTD sounds appealing - in a nutshell, write everything down in a super organized system; then rely on this system to keep track of small, actionable next steps. Forget the big picture and forget priorities, just pick one small actionable task, focus on it exclusively until it is done, and then pick another. Decide on the fly what you should do next. Viola - ""stress free productivity.""Practically speaking, though, it was a flop. Without priorities, I had no idea what was important and what was ephemera. I had no plan to keep me on track, to keep from checking email, returning the easy call and so on. I also couldn't say, ""although my to do list is two miles long, all I really have to do to stay on top and keep things moving are these 20 things today."" Instead, I was looking a hundred things or more, from many projects, all jumbled up. Does that sound stress free?"
3,Getting a little out of date,I think it is worth a read and has some classical approaches that are still relevant today but I'd like to see an updated version that better encompased modern tools and technology.All in all worth the money for the ideas I got from it.
5,mind like water!,"This book is a great book, a life-saver for anxious, overworked people. I now get more done, but with less anxiety (""mind like water"", as David puts it). I was an obsessive list-maker, but his system and suggestions helped me control my lists (instead of vice versa). Some people might think this book covers ""obvious common sense"", but knowing about something and knowing how to put it into action are OCEANS apart. I highly recommend this book."
4,Back to Basics,"The spleen vented by the one-star reviewers is baffling to me. The book details a good way to organize one's life and priorities. It will not be the best style for everyone. By reading some of the complaints, one would think they expected an exciting drama. Get a grip folks, this is a GTD book. It isn't going to be all that ""exciting"" but practical. It is a skim type of book, but there is a place for books like that. I found it helpful and was heartened to see that I was already intuitively doing some of his hints, but he expressed good reasons why I do them."
1,A very low-quality book,"This book was one of the worst I have ever read. It lacked a plot, it lacked characters, it lacked a story. Take my advice and read something else, anything else."
3,The Patty Duke Show Season 1,"I remember this show from TV Land years ago and rather enjoyed it at the time. So I decided to purchase the first season to see if I remembered why I enjoyed it It was ok but I guess the feeling for the show, I guess just wasn't there."
3,5 stars for nostalgia,"Creakily plotted but it takes me back to childhood - how I wanted to live in that house, that neighbourhood, go to that school! And kudos for whoever thought of the phrase ""identical cousins"" and then managed to use it so shamelessly. No wonder I headed for NYC and Brooklyn in particular the first time I went overseas. Drooling over the skyscrapers part of The How and Why Wonder book: From Caves to Skyscrapers"" played a part too."
3,An average game,"The dating sim thing is fun the first few times, but there isn't much else to do here. Some of the girls are REALLY obnoxious, and the gameplay is so-so. The Battle system, however, is simply terrible. I played it once and sold it. It's not worth the money, really."
2,Horrible,"This game would be awesome with the exception of a fewthings. You have to date women to gain power. Now what is that tellingus? That women are only good since they make men stronger? ... And the one on one battling is stressing. This game is so horrid, that I've given it to my ex-boyfriend. Don't waste your money by buying this."
3,Nitro Menace,"Relatively easy to assemble, (took about 4 hours), a brilliant looking machine. Lego need to make more of these types of cars but put engines in them like the Ferrari racers."
2,Case is good but the Magellan eXplorist is the worst,"Two times I tried to get Magellan support and was on hold for 45 minutes the first time and the second time I was on hold for more than 60 mintues until the support office closed at 8:00 pm EST at which time no one was going to answer. The support is terrible without question.Now lets talk about the product. My two month old Magellan eXplorist 500 has died. First it lost it BaseMap which was a pain to replace. I had to pull the battery, replace the batter, reboot the unit and go into reformat mode. Then copy the BaseMap back into the unit and life was good for about a week. Now it cuts off on it's own requiring the battery to be pulled to reset and turn the unit back on. After doing this a few times for a few days, it has now finally died and now I'm stuck with a broken GPS and no support. YOU THINK THIS WILL BE THE LAST MAGELLAN I BUT?"
3,Nice CD,"After listening to Drew's Famous Halloween Party Music, I found some of the songs to be good, I especially enjoyed the Monster Mash cut."
4,Good descriptions of Rodin's pieces,"This book depicts most of his major works with many color photographs. Likewise, a short narrative accompanies each photo describing the artist's inspiration, background and overall effect of each piece. A good book to accompany any novice wanting to learn more on Rodin."
3,Could have been a classic,"I believe that, had Howkins left out the rambling and disorienting narrative style (and abolished the Hiddle character forever), this might have been a great book. For the most part, her storytelling is riveting, and she ranks among the best as far as describing the technical aspects of climbing. I only wish that one of her editors had asked for revisions, revisions, revisions, because the hitchhiker device is almost enough to completely ruin a good story. It is contrived, and one has to skip almost all of the conversation to find the good parts about the Himalayan climbs. The only thing I can imagine, is that Hiddle is in fact a phantom, a residue hallucination from spending a bit too much time above 23,000 feet."
2,If you want epic mountaineering story this is NOT it!,"An ok read however overall quite a disappointment. Given that not many female climbers reach amazing heights, I would expect the ones that do to be inspirational but Heidi is just a whiner and should have told this story to a shrink not forced it upon keen mountaineering readers."
2,it's ok,"I don't really get all the Love that Lay Z opps I Mean Jay Z gets??His tone&vibe are so basic it hurts my head.now He teams up with Beyonce on a Old 2Pac track&doesn't add any Life too it.the true ""Bonnie&Clyde"" of rap Songs was the one Ice Cube&Yo-Yo did back in the early 90's.this is a dime a dozen just like much of what Jay Z does."
1,died in 3 months - not great pic,"I've had only NEC's for over 10 years. My last 2 CRT's suffered severe distortion within the first year. Replaced by NEC, the same thing happened with the reconditioned they gave me in return. Went to this LCD 3 months ago, and while the pic quality wasn't the best, I still hung on to the NEC quality of old. Well, this one has died too! I have now given up on NEC. It might just be bad luck, but so many performance issues has made me wary."
4,Cute Coat,"I am really enjoying this coat. It fits nicely and it's really nice that it is reversible! I wasn't sure how heavy it would be when I ordered it - it turns out that it's heavy enough for most Nebraska winter days (when paired with a hat and scarf), but I would opt for a heavier coat once the temperature dips below 20 or so."
2,MInor disappointment,"This anthology lacks continuity and some tunes are not well produced. I got it for a bargain price and really like Ms. Jones' music, but would be quite unhappy if I'd paid full retail for this one. There are many good tunes for your money if you can get it for the right price. I believe I'll study it and do a remix, using the other couple rlj albums I own."
4,"Nicely bound, interesting little book",This is a cool little book about Egyptian hieroglyphics and some fictional uses for them. The best part of this book is the nice cloth hardcover with its embossed graphics and text.
3,Pretty Good Start,"Although I really liked the concept of this story, I was somewhat disappointed by the characters which seemed rather dry and underdeveloped. The dialog just struck me as being rather bland and trite. I was also hoping for a greater level of character detail, more like what was given to the city itself. This lack of depth somewhat prevented me from emotionally investing myself in the plight of Lina; at least not to the extent of, for instance, Lyra of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. That said, I still found it to be an enjoyable read with an imaginative concept. The City of Ember is a promising beginning and I look forward to an even better, richer sequel."
4,Really enjoyed Ember,"I thoroughly enjoyed the world created here, it's written excellently and it is not hard to immerse yourself in the City of Ember. When I was through reading it I had to immediately download the next book and keep reading until the sun came up :DAfter reading the series (minus book 3) I watched the movie and as so often - the book is so much better!"
5,Mandi's Reveiw,"Have you ever wondered what it's like to live underground? ""The City of Ember"" is a book about an underground city.The citizens of Ember were supposed to leave Ember fifty years ago,but no one knows how to get. Now,there is trouble because the city is running out of supplies.Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow go on an exciting adventure to save the city with the ripped up directions Lina's cuckoo Grandmother found. To bad Lina's little sister,Poppy,got to the insructions and chewed them all up!This was an adventurous story by Jeanne Du Prau and now I can't wait to read the sequal ""The People of Sparks""!"
4,Cool Idea,"I enjoyed the book. It was a cool idea, a city shrouded in darkness, looking for a way out. It was well written, and it really leaves you hanging for the next installment."
5,"OMG, this is an AWESOME book!!!!","i loved this book so much. it had rich writing, a good plot, and great characters. anyone will like this book. it also ends with the best cliffhanger i have ever read."
3,The City of Ember's light is nearly out,"I purchased this book as part of a reading list for my daughter who is entering 6th grade. So actually this review is her feedback to me -- DISAPPOINTING!!! She felt that the book's idea was interesting but that the writing lacked the richness of detail that makes a book interesting and that the plot took A LONG TIME to get going. Further, she is now reading THE GIVER and thinks that they simply copied a lot of that book. (BTW: She really LIKES The Giver). So for your sci-fiction buffs, try the GIVER and they might be more satisified."
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!,"The City of Ember is the best book I have read so far! It is filled to the rim with adventure and suspense. The alternate city, Ember, is very unique, and so are the main characters, Lina and Doon. Jeanne Duprau is now my favorite author!"
3,"OK audio book, but one I would rather have borrowed from the Library","The age listing for the book is accurate. It was entertaining and a good story. I have suggested to my daughter that she read it (she is ten). Having listened to it, I feel it is age appropriate for her and is close to her reading level.As an audio book, the narrator was excellent, but the female voice did seem to fit in my mind with the story. The dramatic parts never really held a sense of drama.At times the book drug on at a slow pace and whereas I would have skimmed had I been reading, I more or less had to endure it in the audio book format. Though I could have fast forwarded on my iPod, I find that that is not the same as skimming.I suspect I will donate my copy to the library."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining Read,"My 12 year old son brought this book to me and said, ""Mom, I think you would like this book. You should read it.""He and I generally don't have the same taste in books, but I politely took it, thanked him, and set it aside.I had to take an airplane across the country last week so I stuck this book in my bag. I started reading and didn't want to stop. For a first book, Jeanne Duprau did a WONDERFUL job. This book made me FEEL something. It was a page turner and I felt genuine tension for the plot of the characters!!I finished it and immediately had to order book 2. And I have to read it BEFORE I let my son read it. LOL.I am a writer myself, and so I almost always can guess where a plot is heading when I read a book. But not this one. Kudos."
5,really fun book,This book is great its keep you thinking about what gonna happen next this book just takes you away into the story.if you close your eye you feel the pian the mystery but i warn you once you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this book is great for kids 9-18 i picked such a huge range becuase it's really fun and my 40 year old teacher read it and told me that she was really into it!!this book will make you feel so wonderfull that you will have to right a great review.my favorite part is when doon and lina (the two main charictors) find uot the little secret that they find out and then the garud catch one of them.......but if you want to find out the rest PLEASE READ THIS BOOK
4,The mystery of a dying city...,"I knew the movie was coming out, and from what I saw, it looked good. I heard such good things about it too. Since I am teacher, I try to read a lot of young adult titles so I can encourage reading and because I am still a kid too :)You follow Lina and Doon throughout this underground city learning about their way of life and it sounds similar to ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, but as you progress through the book, you see how it is different. Basically, the City of Ember is dying, and they have no knowledge of anything beyond there city gates. Lina and Doon find clues and follow them, and continue to follow and reconfigure those clues until..... read it and find out :)Good book, teaches values and importance of carrying out a job and more things as well...After I finished the book, I rented the movie.. I must say.... MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
2,Not so thrilled...,"I found DuPrau's prose to be dry, and it felt as though she spoke down to her readers, instead of treating them as equals. However, I give the plot five stars. The idea of the story, the characters, and the setting were all fantastic. However, I was constantly annoyed by the author's choice of words and style of writing. She seems to be trying a little too hard. Duprau's writing is more suited for an instructional arts and crafts book than a novel. However, I can see why this book has risen in popularity and why so many people love it."
2,ONLY Half Science-fiction---Don't Bother Reading It,"Book launches into the exciting story only in the 1st half of the bk when the message was almost deciphered. I hated all that reading thru all that boring character & city description (some may find this intriguing) about the characters just to get to the real, important plot about egression. This is the kind of bk that mixes realistic fiction & science fiction. It is supposed to be the latter, but it feels so much like the former. I am a science-ficiton/fantasy purist reader & nothing else. That's why this bk deserves a lower grade. It contains no excitement for me, no matter how well the charcters are developed, when the momentum of the story is just as weak as the superdull realistic fiction part of it."
5,The City Of Ember,This book was awesome!!!!!!!! a friend gave it to me to read and instantly i was hooked on it. i never wanted to put the book down
4,Very good.,"This was a very good book. Well written and insightful. It seemed to drag on a bit too much at some points but on the whole, it kept me interested. I definitely recommend it."
3,Good but Predictable,This book is good but I do admit I got the ending on pg. 50. This book is exciting and it keeps you coming back to see what happens thinking you are wrong but in the end it ends the way you expect.
5,Clever and Entertaining,"I was a bit embarrassed purchasing a book labeled as ""8 and up"", considering I'm well into adulthood. The story sounded really interesting and I just had to get it! It's written simply for children to read, but can most certainly be enjoyed by older folks as well.This book is very clever and what's most entertaining is how clueless people are of what each of us take advantage of in our daily lives. If you like stories of humanity's struggle to survive (and who doesn't?) I really urge you to read this book. Ignore the the age recommendation if it makes you feel better!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"There are a few stories in this book that are self-contained. The basic premise is of supernatural secret agents.Steve is a werewolf, his wife Virginia is a witch. She of course has a familiar, so some of thefamily get along like literal cats and dogs. This goes from spy story to humour."
5,Great collection,"Not one weak number in the group and, for those of you not familiar, Johnny Hartman gets some coverage. The Ella piece and Hartman would be worth the price by themselves."
2,Missing My Favorite Body By Jake Workout,"Without Steve Maresca's full body workout, this video isn't worth it for me. It does have his abs workout, and Marco Reed's full-body workout, but Steve Maresca's full body workout is the best of the series for me, and it's not on the video. Therefore, I don't recommend it."
5,Sneak preview...shh...,"It seems like I'm the first person to get my hands on this wonderful game. I won't go into a lot of detail for obvious security reasons, but I will say this game is EXCELLENT. It took me an hour or two to get used to the gameplay, but once I figured it out, the next 5 hours flew by. I was so upset when I had to give it back! Like I said, for security reasons I can't give any details about unreleased games, but I had to tell someone how awesome this game is!"
2,Definately Not Like Morrowind,"I was dissapointed that this wasn't like Morrowind because many of the previews I read said ""It's like Morrowind with Pirates"". I thought it was terribly clunky all around and the controls were driving me crazy. Rent it first if you can actually find a video store that carries it."
3,Problems,"The game is Great, I have spent many hours playing it I have'nt had any complants on the control of the game,however if you have alot of patience you will enjoy it. the game freezes up ALOT and has some problems with loading.Overall it's a good game if you save your game often."
2,pirates of the caribbean,"I had a problem with this video game. It came damage, I never can see the video game.I was explain the problem but I never recived any solution at this problem."
2,not impressed,"I purchased this car seat after talking with a member of the Babies r us staff. He had me convinced that this was one of the best ones and people really liked it because it went up to 80 lbs. After some serious grunt work of installing, I was excited to try it out. I was not impressed with this seat at all. It was very hard to get tightened in the rear facing position. It seemed maybe every 1 out of 5 times it felt secure enough. One day while I was driving home I looked in the rear view mirror only to see that my baby had fallen all the way forward and the shoulder straps had slid off. If you are looking for a safe ride for your baby in the car, I don't recommend this car seat."
5,Farkel is a fun family game!,"This is a fun game for the whole family. It encourages quick math skills and is very durable. It is also great to travel with because of its small size. We took this game with us on a trip to Africa. All that is needed is a piece of paper and pencil to keep score. It is fun to egg on the other players to continue rolling but then they ""farkel"" and loss all their points. How many times do you dare to roll the dice?"
2,Missing the Point,"If you are new to JavaScript and looking for a helper title, this isn't it. If you're already familiar with JavaScript, and need specific information, you probably need more than an extremely condensed pocket reference is going to provide. There really isn't anything wrong with the pocket reference - it has correct information, formatted pretty well, and contains the most common parts of the core language as well as the common DHTML references one needs for general use. What it doesn't have, and shouldn't for a pocket reference, are complete explanations for the components, or any usage examples - two things needed by people who are turning to a reference book. JavaScript is really too complex to be summarized along with DHTML elements in 127 half-sized pages. If you're looking for a JavaScript reference, purchase the authors full-sized reference guide, ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"" (ISBN: 0596000480) instead."
3,just not meaty enough,"I use it on occasion to refresh my memory about an attribute name or a method, but I usually have to go to the big books to get any more help than that. It's skimpy."
2,That's an extra star for knowing what he's talking about.,"I'll give Deuterman credit for knowing what he was talking about. Overall, this book was lousy. It could have been good if he left out half the romance and replaced it with something exciting or suspenseful. This is the first and last Deuterman book for me."
2,Caution,"A word of caution. The ad states, ""Free audio CD includes all the exercises in the Student Book, providing a model of correct pronunciation for each sound."" The audio CD's that are included do not cover all of the excersises in this book. These CD's only cover the ""check yourself"" section at the end of the book. You have to order a separate book and Audio Program to get all of the excersises."
5,Really simple,"I purchased this book a month ago. It really helped me a lot, It has simple graphics for the different sounds and exercises well prepaid. I love this book."
5,Antz For Real,"I used to collect ants when I was younger, putting them into fishbowls filled with dirt to watch them build their nests. I think the various behaviors they exhibit are fascinating and I find it quite enjoyable to read Ms. Gordon's book. She's obviously not a novelist, but her writing style is easy to read, to the point, and displays a sense of humor and good-naturedness. I agree with the earlier reviews- this is a lot easier and more interesting to read than a dry textbook, yet it is an excellent source of information about the particular types of ants she studied. If you've never given much thought to these little creatures, reading this book will give you an appreciation of what an amazing world exists within an ant colony and its environs."
4,JP,"Love this tent! It handled pouring rains on the Superior Hiking trail without a problem. Plenty of room for two, with boots at the bottom and packs at the top.I don't typically use a footprint, so I coated the bottom with silicone and I never have an issue with moisture seeping through. Condensation will accumulate on the large aluminum hoop and will drip occasionally, but what do you expect when tenting in the rain?"
4,Very informative,I recently got my first Red Rump parakeet. Ordered this book to get good basic information on care and such. Felt it was a good basis all around book for all Australian parakeets. Went into many types of the Australian keets.
3,Good book but ordered for someone else,The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because I simply looked through it briefly. I ordered it for a friend of mine who has a Pale-headed Rosella. I assume she finds it helpful. Sorry I couldn't be more specific!
5,Still good after all these years,"When my husband died in 1990 in a plane crash, I was given this book by his aunt. It helped me to understand that I was going to live through this time and come out on the other side a different person. It taught me the different stages that I HAD to go through in order to come out of the grief process healed and actually on my way to healing and being happy again.I still recomend this book to everyone who has lost a loved one either by accident or by sickness. Get it and start the healing process!!"
4,A Helicopter View,"This is quick, helicopter view of the stages of grieving. It identifies the characteristics of each stage and helped me see transitions that will come in the process. I also purchased it for my siblings as we just lost our Mom last month to cancer. Highly recommended."
2,very dissappointing,"I bought this cd last year with high expectations, only to be completely let down. Be warned, these are not the true original recordings, they sound as if they were recorded from a cheap toy piano. As was stated in previous reviews, I bought this collection of songs for holloween mood music, as well as for my personal collection, as I am a big horror fan. To use this as music for halloween would be a joke. On the other hand, if you are looking for true horror movie music I would highly reccomend the cd by the name of the history of horror. That by far has been the best collection of horror music, and does not even compare to this...."
4,great,if you like horror movie music then this CD is for you.. you have some great music from some great horror movies
3,Great guitarist/Poor camera work,"These guys are really good! Too bad guys filming didn't use more forethought and planning as to how to shoot the gig. I bought the DVD to watch & listen to the guitar players. Unfortunately, too many angles were shot from behind the performers backs and over their shoulders. or at the performers faces causing viewers to miss many ""hot"" licks with their fingers. Pan to the organ, bass, and drums when appropriate, BUT, the focal point of the DVD should have been Danny & Tom--from the front. Camera work was the only thing that really bothered me--Rated DVD 3-star because of that."
4,good but annoying,"workouts a really good, but i have to say Billy Blanks repeats his words a lot like ""work it, work it, work it"". it does get very annoying but exericises are great, but he's really annoying!"
1,Poor,Do not waste your time getting this book unless you get the CD's with it. Everything is based off the discs and w/o them you are stuck. :/
3,"Nerdville, U.S.A.","I was going to buy turntables from my roommate's girlfriend's brother, but then he broke up with her and i wrote a nasty story about her online and she found it so I didn't get to buy turntables, but then my girlfriend bought me turntables for my birthday. So I bought this DVD to learn how to do everything... it's pretty informational on set-up and the basics, but just boring as hell and slow. I couldn't even stand watching it... his samples are pretty boring too, running trumpet loops over techno beats... looping breaks, etc. This DVD would be good for learning basic techo blends. As I'm looking more towards spinning hip hop and scratching... i'd recommend DJ Qbert's Do It Yourself Scratching DVD. It's great."
3,A Daddy for Hannah,"Since the moment she'd given birth to beautiful Hannah, Paris Hanley knew she'd do anything to protect her child. So when Ethan Tarlington knocked on her door offering her the job of a lifetime, Paris ignored the flutter in her heart and said yes.Now, Paris was living and working with Ethan, trying to keep the secret that threatened to reveal itself every time Hannah battered her lashes at her handsome daddy. Before long, Ethan's obvious love for her daughter convinced Paris she had to tell him the truth...But was Ethan ready to be a daddy to Hannah - and the husband Paris had always longed for.This book is book one of ""Baby Times 3"" - Three bachelor brother surrender to the power of love...and revel in the bond between father and baby."
3,Basically the extended version of the movie,"As has been said by other reviewers this book is the full script for the movie turned in to a novel.It becomes obvious when reading the book that it was written off the script and not after the final movie was released as there are some things that happen slightly differently.If you have seen the movie and the deleted scenes on the DVD then this book adds nothing to the story, but is however a reasonably plesant read."
3,"show, don't tell","As others have noted, this book doesn't nearly capture the energy of the movie. One major problem is that DeCandido often violates the cardinal rule of good writing: show, don't tell. There are way too many scenes in which DeCandido fills space by telling you what's going on in a character's head, stating the obvious in often obvious ways. For example, we know that Jayne often is trigger-happy. Did we really need DeCandido as the narrative voice to tell us that's what Jayne is thinking at a particular time?Tie-in novels work best and have lasting value if they tell the story of the movie in a new way or add new material (Matt Stover's Revenge of the Sith novelization is still the gold standard for movie tie-ins). By contrast, you can get everything you'll want out of the story by watching the movie and deleted scenes."
4,Only for diehard Firefly fans,"This is an OK novelization of the movieSerenity, but if you're looking for background or more detail, you won't find it here. It doesn't add any substantial value to theFireflyfranchise. I guess that's the problem of movies turned into books, as opposed to books turned into movies. Most movies based on a book don't do the book justice, since you can only fit so much of them into a two hour movie. This novel stays completely within the bounds of the movie. Hopefully Joss Whedon will expand the Firefly 'verse with better quality novels."
4,Strong Novelization,"Most film novelizations, frankly, aren't that impressive. A boring, stoic retelling of a story that was conceived for film and, as such, doesn't translate to the written word that well. DeCandido's adaptation, however, is far better than your standard novelization.While it does tell the story of the film, and well, it also delves much deeper into the Firefly universe. The book contains references to nearly every episode of the Firefly television show - references left out of the film - as well as gives us insight into characters who didn't get quite the spotlight in the film. We get the history of Mr. Universe, for instance, and how he got mixed up with Mal Reynolds and his crew. We get different viewpoints - such as seeing Mal and Inara's communiqué from Wash's standpoint or River's climactic heroism through Jayne's eyes. The novel really is something of an experience in its own right, and anyone who digs Firefly and Serenity could certainly do worse than to read this book."
4,Wow,"Excellent. This book was truly amazing. It displayed everything a great novel should display. It was written perfectly. The plot was extravagant! The way Duprau made the characters and their attitudes only made the book even better. My only negative comments to add are that they didn't give a good enough description ""the weapon"" that was terrible. I am looking forward to the sequel if it is to be as good as The City of Ember and The People of Sparks. Two thumbs up!"
4,not the best i have read this year,the people of sparks is a good book but not as good as the first one. i read it and i was glad it was over.
2,NO NO NO!!! by jordan,To start off this review the first book was very good. So what makes me not like the second???1 it's way to slow2 it took 250 pages for the actual conflict to erupt3 the characters became more boring and dullMy suggestion to this autor: Next time make it more exciiting
3,"It completes the story, but...","I did not enjoy this book as much as The City of Ember. It ties up some loose ends from the first story, but it's just too predictable for my taste. My students really enjoyed the first book and I couldn't wait for this one to come out in paperback to add it to our library. I was disappointed by it and so were they."
3,Better then City of Ember,I thought this one had a bit more going on then the first book did. I still felt like I was reading a 5th grade reader book but was okay with that. The story has lots of good morals and reminders. I was very happy with the ending of the book and for me I could leave the other books out and just have this ending to finish the story for myself. I was satisfied with the way this one ended and don't feel like I need to read any of the other books. I would recommend these books to my friends with children. They are good family night time reads :)
1,Waste of money,"A ridiculous waste of money. I always wonder if the sellers or producers of the dvd's go out to these review sites and plug them.A cd of a guy playing bad SRV, Tabs would have been very helpful or at tell me least the key chords & notes he is playing"
2,Great show!,"Well, I've seen a lot of great reviews on these two dvd's. But this is my review:Greg Koch is one of the greatest SRV replicas I have ever seen! On some of the licks, it's actually almost like hearing SRV himself!Well God bless you, Greg!But these dvds are more like a preformance than a lesson.You will not learn a note unless you are a professional guitar player!Let it be said that learning Stevie's stuff is a BIG challenge in itself.But Greg could have broken down some of the licks instead of just performing them and slow it down only once...Greg has a good sence of humor though, and like I said; Great performance! You are an awsome guitar player! I just wish I could say guitar TEACHER as well..PS: I'm sure he's a great teacher. But the dvds.."
5,Great gift,this made a great Christmas gift for my sister and I believe she will use it and benefit from it as well
5,"Yes, it exists -- and its great","Why on earth would someone give this a one star review simply because he pre-ordered it and the item was pushed back??? People don't make any sense.Anyway, this thing finally came out today. This is a superb collection with fantastic sound quality, a heaping handful of great outtakes, and a recording of an interview with Gram. It's a fine set for diehards and casual fans alike in that even if you've had these albums for 30 years, there is still plenty new to hear.There is a booklet loaded with text and some pictures I'd never seen. The discs are contained in miniature LP replica jackets -- my only complaint is that there are no inner sleeves to protect the discs from getting damaged while sliding in and out of the cardboard. But that's a minor detail. The packaging looks great, the music is excellent. I can't say enough good things about it."
4,Would be perfect if I had ordered the right one,"Arrived promply and was perfect in all ways, except for the fact that I didn't read the description well enough to realize that it was not for my 2005 Nissan Pathfinder."
4,A Different Face of Philip Pullman,"A strange facade of Philip Pullman's writing is displayed within the pages of the novel, The Ruby in the Smoke. The style of writing is very different from most others, and this story is a very different branch form the Dark Materials. The Ruby in the smoke is a historical fiction, with no fantasy. Yet it was brilliant.Sally was a great, and well put together, character. She was very real, and easy to follow. The plot, two mysteries entwined with each other, was interesting, and fit the story very well. Philip Pullman could have presented the solving of the mysteries with a bit more ""Kapow,"" but other than that this was a great read."
5,Only Brillance and Beauty!,I feel in love with Lyra from page 1! This book has permentally inspired and moved me in unimaginable ways. The ingenious that Philip Pullman inplys with every word rushes into my imagination with speed and excitment! This book is utterly made up of only the most original and creative plot ever dreamed! I only hope to spread the message and faith this book brought me to the millions of other people out there.- Abby in CT
1,Not good enough to excuse unsuitable content,"This book was classroom reading in my daughter's 7th grade Advanced English class. There are many murders, including murders (in self-defense) by two of the main characters. Opium smoking is used as a plot device to recover lost memories, which helps solve the central mystery and move the action forward. Even the heroine smokes opium to enhance her memory. The book was by no stretch a good enough read to excuse this content for this age group. It reads like a cross between a harlequin romance and a Nancy Drew mystery."
1,RIPOFF??,"The premise of the book is an excellent one, and one I have put to use in everyday life and business. However, Mr Ury seems to have taken the idea and title from a book written by Kim DeMotte---""The Positive Power of No"" written August 2003.I encourage readers to check out this book and his website. It has proven to help my business and many others."
4,Good story with plausible science behind it,"I enjoyed the story, and the realistic scientific speculation that went into the technology and science. In many ways it feels like classic James Hogan type storytelling. I would have given it one more star except that it felt like the author's politics and views on gun control were being pushed on me. I think that it is not just from this story, as I have read a couple of other works by Travis Taylor and felt the same thing. That said, it is still a good read."
3,Terrible,"First I must say that the author of this book shows promise.After he polishes his skills he should wright a book. However not this book; how he got this unfinished amatuer piece published is beyond me.I read the inside flap and thought it MIGHT be good and then I read the reviews on the back cover ; John Ringo,Jim Baen both gave it rave reviews (do these people actually read the books they review?) So I bought Warp Speed and The Quantum Connection which is the sequal. This was the biggest waste of fifty dollars that I can imagine.By the way the sequal is worse than the first book."
1,Complete waste of money!!!,I bought this Product thinking it would be informative but it's more like the instructor want to show you his skills without taking the time to instruct the student on how to acquire said skills. It's a complete failure put out by Hal Leonard I expected more from one of the Premier guitar instructional companies. Don't waste your money.
1,Just give your money a way!,you can learn a lot more from youtube! this is the worse i have ever seen! man what a let down! if you are looking to buy this please dont you will not learn one thing from it!
3,Amusing yet tedious,"The game concept is actually pretty decent and the actual gameplay is amusing. The recruitment negotiations are a hit or miss although using several chosen monsters to do the talking instead of the main character is a good idea. I didn't particularly care for the amount of text - its a good thing you can change how fast the text types on screen. Also, the need to back out of the menu is tedious. I would have preferred to be able to hit one button to bring me back to the main screen. If that's an option, I haven't found it yet. One major fallback is if your character loses a battle he/she is transported to the inn of their main town. This means having to traverse back out again which can become too repetitive. I've enjoyed what I've played thus far, having the option to save in 3 files is useful and recommended prior to going in to ""dangerous"" situations. Its an entertaining game and I think those who do get it may find it fun."
3,Great Book!,"After reading the reviews for this book I quickly went out and bought it. It really is a great book. There's only 71 pages but alot happens. It's written in the way a play is. You feel so many emotions reading this book. Although it is a little confusing it's a great book! It's about this guy Tar who runs away from home at 14 and his girlfriend later runs away to be with him. It shows how they grew up and changed within themselves and the good and bad choices they made and how they quickly became addicted then tried to send it.""Tar (to audience) Love is forever! Yeah, well I don't beliebe that any more. Being an addict. . . now that's forever. It was a love story. Me, Gemma and Junk"""
5,A Must Read,"Mr. Ottenheimer has written an extremely insightful book about the events leading directly up to the Holocaust, the Allies drive to push Nazism out of Europe at the end of the war, and the restoration of normalcy in Europe after the war - all events that the author experienced first hand. The book also reflects upon how this era is addressed in the schools and teachings in Germany today and even parallels events of that era to world politics in our era. This book is extremely well-written and easy to read. I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in history."
2,Works for a Little While,"I honestly don't know what to think of microcassette recorders. You figure Sony has to produce a good one; after all, it's Sony. Well, not necessarily. I bought one of these because I do occasional taped interviews. It seemed to work well and always got the attention of the people I interviewed. But alas, it lasted for only about three months, then it stopped recording. It soon after stopped playing, as well. No one abused it, dropped it or subjected it to any jolts. It just stopped working...which is a shame because this recorder was convenient and came with that spongy thing around the mic which cut down on wind noise.This is about the third (and last) Sony I'm going to try. I think I'll try Olympus next."
1,Don't buy this!,"I have used crock pots for years with great success. My son bought me this one as a gift and it certainly looked attractive. The problem with this one is that the heat regulator is not working. It is on full blast high or nothing at all. The low setting just does not work. It gets extremely hot on the outside, burning hot! The food burns if left all day ( or all night). You pretty much have to stand over it. This is not safe to be left to cook when you are not home. I have just burned my last meal in this one. Out in the trash it goes!"
2,Cracked,I've had this crockpot for going on two years worked great until it cracked it was a hairline crack at first but got consistently worse. If you just want a cheap crockpot I would say this would be good if you want a crockpot that will last I would not recommend this item.
4,Exactly right for the price.,"I have had this crockpot for several months, and use it frequently. I love it! I had another slow cooker previous to this one, and was not happy with it. This one does exactly what it is supposed to do. The 4-quart size is the perfect size to make meals for my husband and me. It gives us enough food for several meals. The most common things I make in it are shredded beef (Machaca), Shredded Chicken, roast beef, lentil soup, and bean soup.Unlike other reviewers, I've not had any problems with it cooking too hot or with the lid spattering. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I wish it was programmable."
1,Don't even think about it,"I bought this model because I thought it was attractive. Silly me. The two times I used it, it burned the bottom of the pot and what was cooking in it. The third time, it didn't even turn on. I came home to find that it hadn't even started. I tried different outlets and still nothing. Really not worth it."
2,Can't trust the low setting.,"I have had this crockpot for about 3 yrs. with problems on and off about burning my food. - figured it was my fault, because I wouldn't always have it 2/3 full even though I followed recipes exactly. I would always have to watch the food very carefully to watch for burning. I'm finally ""throwing in the towel"" and getting rid of it. Last week and yesterday, I caught my slow cooker burning my food on the ""low setting""; the outside was very hot to touch. Yesterday, within 2 hrs of cooking, the liquid was boiling and the beans burning. Going to get a brand with better reviews and a smaller one in case that might be the problem."
1,I apologise on behalf of Britain for this shite,"I live in England and thought id check out whether these 3 dorks were popular...and it seems that you have given them more credit than they deserved- but the kids of the UK did that too and they stayed around! I apologise for this poo, it really is awful- but thank god that they have since split up (whoo!) Please appreciate TRUE British music like The Zutons, Blur, Kaiser Chiefs, Franz Ferdinand, Pulp, The Clash, Bowie, Jam, Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin, Oasis, Supergrass, etc and not this national embarrassment. Busted are Shod McTodd, and this album is their ""best"" tracks! and they ripped of the Undertones for ""Teenage Kicks""....poorly! Obliterate this poo, please."
1,Why cant we give these negative numbers?,"If this would go lower than 1 I would choose that but unfortunately it dont so Im gonna reluctently give this 1 star. I was given this as a gift my someone who mistakenly thought they were something like Blink 182 or Sum 41 but they are NOT! These guys have an absolutely horrible album that you shouldnt even think about downloading for free of Kazaa or something, it could permanently damage you! So save yourselves and stay as far away from this as possible."
5,Busted Rocks,"Busteds title album is wickedly awsome! They have a sound of there very own and write there own songs.The boys are awsome song writers,singers,and instrument players. Overall the CD rocks and has a mixture of songs that most people can relate to."
5,BUSTED BUSTN' INTO STORES!!!!,"Busted's CD is AMAZING!!! for anyone who wants new music, i would definatly recommend it to anyone! With their funny lyrics and their smashing guitar's, it's a sure hit!!!!!!!~CaitlinLynn"
3,So so,"the tape starts out interesting but twords the end i found myself fast forwarding. It has some good information and exercises, but it doesn't really teach anything that well, more just tests. and testing psychic ability through video is REALLY ironic and not practical at all."
1,"Poor ""replica""","I grew up watching the Thundercats and still pull out old tapes now and then. When I saw this, I thought, ""Great! This will make a good gift for a friend!"" Then I took a closer look at the images. It's almost like the person who made this has never seen the show before. It's nothing like the original. The Eye of Thundera is round, not oval. And what's with the ""bad breath"" lines from the cat's mouth? It's hideous. The guard isn't quite shaped right. The whole thing appears cheaply made.There's no way I'd buy this."
1,Agreed,It does look way off. This thing would offend most serious fans of the show. One bit of speculation I have is that the company couldn't make a good replica because of copyright laws and thus had to make it look so different and strange.
4,Transformers More than Meets the Eye!,"This Transformers: More than Meets the Eye DVD presents the first five episodes of the Transformers: Generation One series. the Transformers episodes are: More Than Meets the Eye parts 1-3, Transport to Oblivion, and Roll for It. This Transformers DVD has no special features on it and only has first five episodes of the original G1 TF series. Highly Recommended if you have never seen the original G1 Transformers cartoon series from the 1980s. A+"
1,The worst Game DONT BUY,"This game is horrible the graphics ""stink"" and the abilities of the cars are unrealistic. The Game is not worth it. The only good thing is some of the cheats. Otherwise the game ...[stinks]!!!"
3,"Very Realistic, but also very hard",This game has incredible graphics. You can actually see the dirt coming off of the tires. However when you get to tracks like Egypt and Russia it gets very hard. There is also a timer that keeps you from passing the game. Then you can't go to the next track if you don't make 3rd place. It's fun at first but gets boring. The cars are fun to drive. There is also an camera angle called motion that allows you to see the driver shifting gears and turning the wheel to the side as you are also seeing the rear view of the car.
2,Unreadable,"This book is nothing more than a series of unaddressed topics. They talk about many possible fiberglass repair situations but never quite get around to telling you how to fix them. Confusing photos. I know as much now as before I got this book. Ask a pint dealer or some old guy at Home Depot, you'll get better information."
1,Don't waste ONE dollar on this piece of junk,"Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself ""buy another one because maybe this one was defective."" I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well.Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back."
2,Great if they work,"If all the bulbs worked I would have given it a four or five - as it does provide some light. However, one of the bulbs stopped working within a few days. One is still working. The other two I don't know about as I gave them away."
5,Bright and Free,i received mine according to what the suppliers promised. product was very satisfying. me and the whole family will really save a lot just from this first ones. cant wait to get more. cheers
1,A Ripoff,Once the bulb goes you have to pay almost as much to replace it as the entire unit. I threw it away.
4,A good quick read,"This book came recommended from a friend to read, since I am into Picoult books. I did not know that there was a movie based on the book, and from what I have heard about it I dont want to see the movie, for fear that it will ruin the compassion that I have for the characters. The book was rather easy to read and the story held my interest. I was however disappointed in the ending. I dont want to spoil it, but it wasn't the way that I had expected from the build up of the characters. I would read Cecelia Ahern's other books based on this one. It was captive and moving. I was more interested in the fact that the author was very young when she wrote this and captured the situation and subject matter better than any person at that age can. I would recommend anyone to read this book, it is heartwarming and moving."
2,Hi-Schoolish,"Interesting premise, lousy book. I ""slogged"" through this book waiting for it to get better. It didn't. The book was disjointed, and the characters were underdeveloped. The author spent a lot of time ""telling"" and not ""showing."" The dialogue was amateurish. I started counting how many times the word sarcastically was used to describe a conversation. Too bad. With a little polish, this could have been a great book."
4,PS I Love You,A very sweet yet honest interpretation of the feelings one has while going through a great loss. A very strong love story that carries on after the passing of a loved one. Currently being filmed to be released in 2008 starring Gerard Bultler and Hilary Swank.
3,don't like waiting to open presents,"and this was like that. I wanted it to over long before the last letter was opened. Some of it was very touching, yet other parts of the book were not very realistic. I would have liked to see the husband's character developed more. I would recommend this book. It is not a sob story yet it does tug at the heart strings."
2,Immature,"Found it immature, 2 dimensional and rather insulting to 30 year old women and people who have lost a spouse."
1,Disappointing,"To start things out, I have to say I haven't read anything so horribly immature since I was in the third grade. I doubt anyone would have the gall to publish this book if it weren't for the fact that Ahern is the Prime Minister's daughter. The writing is forced and boring, the sub-plots just plain stupid, and the characters disgustingly stereotypical. Most of the chapters seemed to be 'fillers'. I was disappointed because Cecelia had a good idea and managed to ruin it with bad writing. I can't even tell you how many times she compared a person in shock to a goldfish. I should have known better, considering I heard about it from an article that only mentioned the book in two sentences. Perhaps it's just because I'm used to reading literature, but this book was nothing more than chick lit, and bad chick lit at that."
4,lovely,"I enjoyed the perspective of the book, its life after a love one dies (her husband)......the book is written well, it keeps you glued through each chapter.....it's definetely a chick book......loved it."
5,Tear Jerker Alert!,This is a great story. It is hard to read because the way the story is told you and completely enveloped in the characters and your heart breaks right along with hers. At least this also means that when she perserveres you cheer her on like you are one of her family members or best friends. Just make sure you keep the kleenex close.
4,Cool knobs,"Just bought these in hope to keep kids from escaping my nursery at church. Well, I was amazed that it worked with them. But more amazing it also works for adults who don't always have the grip it needs to open. I reconmend it for any age from toddlers to elderly patients. Very god product & great quick shipping."
4,Great for the money!,"I had to order these quickly because my sweet boy finally realized that getting out of bed means he can walk over to his door and get out, even if it's 2am. We woke up one morning to find him curled up in bed with us, sleeping away, lol!!These covers are very easy to install - they just snap together. And so far, they are withstanding my toddler's frustrations at not being able to open his door.Only two drawbacks. During a particularly nasty fit of frustration, my son was able to get it off. (I think he just hit it hard enough that it popped off, but it didn't break.) And after putting him to bed, it can be very difficult for me to get out of his room quietly. The little buttons you push in to get a grip so you can twist the knob could be a little grippier. (Yes I could leave the door open a crack in the first place, but then our cats would run in and be a HUGE distraction.)All in all - they solved our problem without forcing us to spend a bundle. :)"
2,"Worked for about a week, then 3-year-old took it off","This is not a well-made product. We had this set up on my daughter's (three-year-old) door and, after she fooled around with it for a few days, she managed to get it off. I am not sure what a good alternative is, but this is really just a waste of your time/money."
3,Worked for a short while.,"These worked for a short while, but my 3 year old son soon figured out how to take it apart and pull it off and open the middle to lock his own door."
4,If you don't have to open the door a lot these are a great option.,For some doors it is a simple squeeze hard and open but it depends upon the handle. There are several doors in our house where you can't really open it with this on it. It works great for our 2 year old though and that was the point of it and so I gave it 4 stars.
1,Another flop...,"Well, we should have known these wouldn't work. We had similar ones before and they kept my teens in and my toddler could get out. We had just moved and the old ones were lost so I bought these for something fast and cheap. Well, they are exactly like the others. One is fairly easy for the family to open (5 out of 10 times) but one refuses to open for them. They twist and turn and you just can not get it to open. I can normally open all of them and even I had problems at least 2/10 times when I try to open a door. Now for the one they are supposed to be for....my 22 month old. He can not grasp them to open them like adults, but he CAN and DOES easily disassemble them and take them off. He does it every time and then looks at us, smiles and opens the door. These are a complete waste. Pay the extra money and get the Kidco Door Lock Knobs."
1,These didn't work at all,"We used them on several different doorknobs in our house, but once we put the cover on the doorknob, no one could open the door. The rubberized button things that are supposed to allow you to grip the doorknob are just not rubbery and slip right off. Fail."
5,For Big Kids Too,"I bought this cookbook for a little friend and her mother has reported back to me that she loves it. She told me her daughter stayed up late and was reading it. She has already chosen a pudding recipe to try as well as one where you cut a hole in a slice of bread, put it in skillet add an egg to the hole and cook, flip, cook. Sounds like fun to me! Mom was impressed with the blank pages in the back for adding recipes. I can almost see her daughter years from now looking through it and smiling as she remembers making certain things and adding recipes to it. Those are things that are priceless. I still have cookbooks given to me by my mother and as I flip through them it takes me back to our kitchen where she taught me how to measure, stir, bake, follow a recipe and praise my end result. Those are treasures you can not buy.. only create- and any child and adult, be it mom, grandma, aunt or good friend can do that with this book. This is a real treasure."
5,Essential,"Great set of books, the four volumes give excellent insight into Erickson. However, if not purchasing the entire set, get volume one or volume four."
4,The only thing better than 3M's production dept. is its PR dept.,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although, rarely a cutting edge innovator. A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those. 3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on. This product might be marginally less opaque, but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products. So, while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes, its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation. One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied. Alas, no such thing: The stuff is still plainly right there if not, perhaps, as plain as day.So, while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still, another excellent product from 3M."
4,"Not a lot on each roll, bug really good stuff.","First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear, this is the right product for you. On that, 5 stars. On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star. It's a better deal and more than the standard ""green"" Scotch tape 3 pack, and the price is lower, but still, you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much, this is a decent purchase. If you don't need tape at multiple locations, I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll, less packaging, etc."
3,"Five stars for product, two stars for value and description of this particular item","Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts. The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy. Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long. And I dislike the fact that the product description on Amazon says nothing about how much tape is included, so you won't realize the issue until you get your order."
1,In the trash it goes.,"The tape does not cut easily on the edge of the dispenser. It stretches if you pulls it to one side, often folds over on itself and I've learned the only way to cut it easily is to use a much monger piece then is often necessary. A total head ache to use so I'm going back regular old tape and throwing this in the trash."
2,How can scotch tape be difficult?,"Maybe it's just me, but when I'm wrapping paper, every finger is engaged in holding things down or in place. I bought this ""gift wrap"" tape because I thought it would be better than regular tape. It may have a satin finish, but man, was it hard to unroll and cut off the dispenser. Forget about using a couple fingers, I had to use BOTH hands in order for me to be able to rip the amount I needed off on the cutter. I don't know if they made the tape thicker or more adhesive, but I won't be buying it again. The satin finish wasn't worth the frustration for me."
4,A new gift-wrapping tool,"I used this tape, which has more of a sheen than regular ""invisible"" tape, on several different kinds of gift wrap. It definitely blends better with papers with a slight gloss to them since it has a similar texture. On matte-surfaced papers like tissue wrap, craft paper, and ""natural"" papers, the slight sheen of the tape makes it show up more. For those who like their wrappings to be really fancy, this tape is a nice addition to wrapping supplies. It would also work well on any project with paper that has a slight gloss to it."
4,a clear Scotch tape,"This new gift wrapping tape and the Scotch brand magic transparent tape I have been using for years are very similar. The old tape is translucent with a foggy finish. The new tape is slightly clearer and more glossy. It doesn't accept ink or pencil marks so easily, but you can write on it with a Sharpie.Overall, the old tape is more useful."
4,Scotch 'n' Roll!,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape, 3/4 inch, 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish, the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper, I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However, my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser, which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape, even if it means paying more, so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll, and there would be far less waste. Altogether, the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
5,Excellent product,"This tape has an excellent adhesive, sticking to paper or foil with no problem. As advertised, the tape is almost invisible on the package. Scotch make quality tape and this is no exception."
5,Outstanding,"This strong, durable tape will be put to great use during the holiday season! This easy to use, long lasting product will be a staple in our household for years to come!"
4,Excellent Information,This is just the book I was looking for. Hopefully this is my first step in entering the political arena.
3,"Good, but not like the other ones!","Well I would like to start off saying that Nikki Giovanni writings are truthful and mostly from her heart and this book was good but not all as I expected from reading her other book Black Judgement,Black....But over all it was a book like no other that I read"
1,Terrible,"I echo all the other reviews. Sure, it's a bootleg ""filmed"" by the band and roadies but that doesn't mean it has to be so bad. The Dimebag tribute should have been left off this disc and a proper tribute put on a professionally produced dvd. The sound on this particular track is horrendous and made my speakers sound like they were blown. Listening to that muddled mess would definitely end up blowing my speakers. Don't waste your money."
2,"Great CD, but DVD is mix of bootleg & MTV Jackass","REALLY enjoyed their music, but godalmighty, the DVD stinks on ice. 2 disks - a DVD & a CD. The DVD: A mix of MTV Jackass stunts by your favorite band members (vomit onna window, bottle rocket out of the mouth, etc.) mixed with Handicam footage shot from the back of the room. CD is excellent, including the videos, but for what you get, WAY overpriced!"
5,Not bad at all,"Despite the absense of some footage from the War Within touring cycle and some better sound quality, this dvd is actually quite good for what it's worth. BE WARNED: the live footage is very raw, very much bootleg. What'd you expect anyway? The band announced online that that was how they wanted to make this. Other than that, you've got the cool music videos from The Art Of Balance and War Within albums, bonus performances, and some zanyiness from the band members."
4,Excellent Concept!,"""Thessalonica"" by Turtledove is a great work of fantasy. It pits Christianity against the dark gods of the Slavs. A splendid work for those of us with a little crusader inside them!"
2,Weird dysfunctional spout,"Can is OK but the spout is awful. Attached to the can it sticks out about 12"" which makes it difficult to store. If yoy remove it there is no way to attach it to the can, and you have to keep up with it. I should have known that if it was approved in California it wouldee be dysfunctional."
4,Almost perfect - way better than platic,"These cans are 10,000 times better and safer than the craptastic plastic cans with the ""spill proof EPA spout"" that makes it impossible not to spill gas everyplace. You can actually carry them in your car and not stink up the car too!That said, they will spray gas all over the place if you don't VENT THE CAN while it is still flat. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the funnel setup will spray/spill a tiny amount of gas anyway if you are not very very precise with opening the can. Much better than the plastic ones, but I wonder if that issue could be solved.I have the 2 and 5 gallon cans and posted the same review for both."
5,This is a clear winner,"The new nozzles that they use for normally gasoline and diesel containers are a pain. Also, when I store gasoline in my garage in a plastic container, I get that odor, so I decided to buy a metal container. The local store sells them at a very high price, so I came on line and found the same exact one for much much less.The first one I ordered had a shipping problem (my guess is the mailman ran out of gas and decided to use it). I called Amazon, which tried tracking the shipping, and their trail was also cold, so they simply sent a replacement.The can works great. I have several gasoline driven items (lawn mower, weed whacker, chain saw) and this makes the filling easy. I highly recommend these over the plastic as they seal better in storage and the funnel is much easier than those new EPA nozzles."
4,5 gallon gas can,"the item was as described, cheaper than the stores around me wanted, and it came well pkged, and to my door step, can't get better than that"
1,Spills gas!,"Ah... the search to find a gas can that pours without making a mess. Unfortunately, this one isn't it.It is sturdy and I like the positive, spring-loaded, rubber-gasketed lid but filling is awkward (why not have a way to hold the lid open?). Most importantly, I couldn't pour without spilling some gas no matter how I tried.The funnel is nearly useless, unless you don't mind gas dribbling down the side of the can and onto your machinery or the ground. The problem is that the funnel doesn't seal around the spout and even with careful pouring to try to keep the flow of gas beyond the funnel-spout connection, some fuel finds its way there and seeps through the ""seal"" and down along the side of the can. I tried taking the funnel off, using it in the traditional way, but still some fuel inevitably would spill down the spout aand the side of the can. The spout is just too short and wide to allow spill-less pouring, especially with a big, awkward can like this."
3,"Very well made, bullet proof...but...",This is a very nice looking device. The transparent case got high marks from the kids who saw it. It is also very solidly made. The screen though doesn't have the resolution to really show the cursive character demonstrations at a high enough resolution. The lines are very jagged and the loops on things like the lower case o's are just not very well done. The machine is a lot better than one star but it isn't a magical device either.
3,"Some Negative Points, but Definitely Better than Print","I bought the KID-240 for my 10-year old daughter who is in fifth grade.Good Points. My daughter thinks that the KID-240 does actually help her with reading and that it is better to have the KID-240 than a printed dictionary. In addition, the KID-240 does look nice.Bad Points. My daughter says that it is sometimes difficult to understand the definitions. I did not buy the KID-240 for the gaming capability, but my daughter says that she likes the Hangman game. She also does not like the deep voice of the computer generated speech. The speech generator sometimes skips words."
5,A great book that I found hard to put down.,"Porn King is a great book with lots of answers to questions that I myself had about the man - the legend. Very vivid and candid. It really gave me a chance to really know John and made me realize that I too, had wrong oppinions of this person."
3,A Good Read,"I found this book to be in-depth and honest especially about his early life leading into his life in porn and his learning that he contracted the AIDS virus. Unfortunately, I went into this book expecting to read a lot more about his life in the porn industry, the film-making, and the stars that he has worked with. While reading about his involvement in the Laurel Canyon incident (which I never even heard of before this book), I found the book to be a little less than what I was expecting. However, I think that even a remote fan would find this to be a nice, interesting read."
2,Not exactly what I expected,"As a connoisseur of pop culture and the adult film world, I eagerly anticipated the release of the autobiography from the man who made porn a household name (at least in my household). I ordered this book from Amazon shortly after it was released and tore into it immediately after receiving it upon my doorstep. While the book was interesting, I believe it to be far more fiction than fact. This is based upon other accounts I've read about this well-hung legend. As told on the recent John Holmes addition of the E! True Hollywood Story, Holmes was prone to exaggeration and fabrication. There was also very little about his life in the adult film world - only a mere skim over. While I wasn't disappointed with the book, I wasn't satisfied either. But, give it a shot and see what you think."
2,"Minor AOR hit: ""Holdin On (Barely)""","Silver Condor had a few minor radio songs, back in the hey day of the AOR (album oriented rock) radio format. This is their 2nd release. The track that received airplay here is ""Holdin On (Barely)"", featuring Neil Schone on guitar. The neat thing about this record is the all star cast. Steve Plunket (pre Autograph) and Kenny Aaronson (Rick Derrenger) are in the band. Other guests include Clarence Clemons and Waddy Wachtel. The album was mixed by the legendary Andy Johns. The music is kind of bland and more blues based than most AOR bands of this period - still, ""Holdin On"" is a solid track and worthy of owning, if you enjoy AOR of this era. ...If you can find it, Silver Condor's first release features two radio songs: Angel Eyes and For The Sake Of Survival. Steve Plunket is not in the band but Earl Slick is (David Bowie, Phantom Rocker & Slick)."
5,Great Help,This is a GREAT book for helping me study for my CDL. This should help my career change go more smoothly.
5,Great for first show.,"I finally bought this show from Lisbon, overall it is a superb show! The audience is having a good time as well as the band. The setlist is nice with Eddie doing a solo version of Last Kiss, and great takes on Red Mosquito and Black. There are some minor errors in this show but it doesn't effect the bands good spirits and the audience sure is estatic, if you looking for a PJ show that is high in energy and everyone is having a great time, this is it. This show is one of my favorites, it only falls behind Milan and Prauge."
4,It was my great-grandfather's railroad route,"My great grandfather, David Webner, took the PRR from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh in 1852. With this book, I was able to travel alongside him throughout the trip. The book provides fascinating detail of the early route. Readers will also enjoy ""On the Main Line"" by Edwin P. Alexander."
3,A decent sequel,"Not quite as good as the first KOTOR, but still worth buying especially at this price.The game was ported directly from the xbox like the first game but where as the first one was tweaked to take advantage of the PC, this one is pretty much ported directly over with no changes made. Because of this there are some glitches (especially if your using Vista, I had to replace my Mss32.dll file to get the game to load. And I had some issues with the video cutting out during cut scenes, had to turn the monitor off and on again to get the video back)As for the game itself, the story line is not as strong as the first KOTOR and there are some pretty big holes in it also. Game play and Combat is pretty much identical to the first game so you'll feel right at home if you have played the first KOTOR already."
3,KOTOR 2 is Better than the original,This game isn't as buggy as i expected and I found it bareable once I patched the game. After discovering the cut content from this game it drastically lowered my rating. Also the ending was kind of weak but overall a good game worth playing on a decent computer.
4,Excellent Game!,"This game is a very fun game! The graphics haven't been updated much since the first one, but gameplay is still good. Also, getting the game to work is a hassle, but can be accomplished if you are computer savvy. Enjoy this great game!"
2,"Bring the Raid, we have bugs!","The play is fun, the script is interesting, but holy COW - the BUGS!!All over the place, unfinished bits here and there that pull you out of the moment. I ended up spending more time noticing the most recent bug (and once having to email Lucasarts when that darn thing just had a black screen).Big heads up to lucasarts - FINISH the game, and beta test it BEFORE you hype it so much."
3,Game is not complete!,"The game is great, except for one little detail: the ending is hurried and part of the storyline is missing. With little warning, your character is sent to the end story, with story threads still incomplete. Apparently, the game was hurried into the stores in time for the holiday season. And the maker will not devote any time to fleshing out the ending now."
4,The bottom line!,"The bottom line is yes a lot of errors as a result of really poor quality control...but with patience and a lot of saving you can get through the game.....patches ok..but the real answer is to release a later version with all the 'fix' including the real ending......so if the company wants to do the right thing... they have the answer..... the game itself has a good storyline, ease of use is pretty good....."
1,Fantastic Game - Doesn't work in Vista,"KOTOR II and its predecessor are, without doubt, amongst the greatest games ever released on PC.That said, as if releasing an unfinished game (KOTOR II has a lot of content in its code that didn't make it into the game due to a release window deadline) wasn't bad enough, the game has received NO support on Vista.Buying this game, if you're running Vista, is without a doubt a gamble. Maybe you can run it. Maybe not. There are workarounds but with varied success on different computers."
2,Watch out for United Kingdom Version!,"When ordering this game please take the extra time to ensure that you are not getting the United Kingdom version. The preview image shows the United States version (rated T for Teen). The UK version will have a 12+ on the lower left corner and will not run on your computer unless it is from the UK.Most of the sellers that are fulfilled by Amazon appear to be for the UK version. I am returning my copy now and am ordering from a seller who ships it on their own.If you have purchased this game and found it didn't work check the corner of your box! This game will work on Windows 7, running it for Windows XP and there are plenty of help threads out there to assist you. However if you got the UK version your computer may not even recognize the disks."
3,Unsatisfying,I've played KOTOR and loved it. This game is more of the same with some added features that are kind of nice but there is no climax. It just ends after you kill the final bad guy. HUH? Lots of playing time and some humor but not really a challenge by the midgame. Still fun to play but nothing fantastic.
2,Windows 7 Fail,"This game is a classic and really deserves to be remembered as such! However, the PC version is totally incompatible with Windows Vista/7. I installed the game with no problems, but then it crashes shortly after character creation or before I can get off Peragus every time."
1,Dissapointing,"I have the first KOTOR game and the game ran almost perfectly with no glitches awsome gameplay and a satisfying ending.THIS however was none of these things, it crased so many times I just gave up playing (i have state of the art system just for your info) it wich means this game was a total waste of money and time. The plot has a million holes in it and seems to not tell you what really happens. Some poeple i know complained about Carth in the first one but all of the characters in this game are 8 times worse. One Very annying factor is your HK droid is totaly ruined compared to the hilarious insulting robot from the original that we all liked. So now i have a 40 dollar paper weight. Wow do i feel lucky. ><So Basically this game is for KOTOR FANATICS ONLY!!!!!"
1,horrible flaws!!!,This game is horrible. You will spend half of your time playing it restarting the game and trying to figure out what is wrong with your copy of the game. Then you start to read the reviews by the people who bought the game and played the game for any amount of time to find out that it is the game and not your copy. There has been promise of a patch to fix the problem from the development team since the end of february. Although the game is a lot of fun I would definately wait until the problems have been fixed with the patches.
3,Too many bugs to enjoy!,"When I bought this game I had already played once on x-box and beat it like 10 times, But I had recently sold my x-box and got this game. Not knowing it had soooooo many game flaws and bugs. I meet the requirements of the game and it doesn't run well, then when it does it doesn't run with a picture. I was going to return this but I had opened the package. All I have to say is do your research and Buyer Beware!!!"
3,I was disappointed...,"Barbie knows that little girls love pink! I bought this for my daughter when she was 3. She loved having something to roll around. However, it is overpriced and not very durable. There are two plastic devices inside that hold the dolls. One promptly fell off and I glued and reglued, but it never stayed put. There is also a little compartment that opens up to put little shoes and clothes in, but it also comes off very easily. That one I was able to click back on (over and over again). There is room for quite a few dolls, but they do not always stay put in their holders. Overall, I wish that this item was more durable since little girls have Barbies for many years. This item will not last as long as the dolls."
1,Horrid Pump...,Do not buy.. The pump nozzle does not work correctly on average bike wheel air nozzles. I could not get this pump on now matter which way I tried to outfit it on the wheel nozz. Also the pump is much smaller than the picture fitting in the palm of my hand meaning the range of the pump will deliver very little air per pump. Depending on how much pumping you have to do (if you can even get the nozzle on) you will be pumping for quite a while.
5,This writer is just too much,This writer is as even handed and fair as she is brilliant. I read Doubt: A History and was left feeling the same way. In addition to being a history of French anthropology this book is an example of the very finest writing.
3,Do The Fish Float?,"This set looks great and has good reviews. I'd love to buy it but I can't tell wether or not the fish will float in the water. Can anyone who owns this product let me know? My son really wants to ""fish"" in the pool. So far reviewers have only said they fish indoors so I am hesitant to buy unless I know my son could actually use this in the water. Please HELP!I gave this product three stars because I don't actually own it so three seemed ""neutral""."
4,great toy,I bought this for my 4 year old godson and he loves it. He hasn't gotten the hang of how to actually catch the fish but he has a ton of fun trying. The only negative thing is he knocked over the tackle box and the latch fell off.
4,Strong on Security - Weak on Cisco,"Excellent overview of network security issues. Covers almost all threats, protocols and safeguards in a concise manner. One of the books that should be read for CISSP preparation.Bogs down when it gets to Cisco specific configurations. As a CCIE, even I find that books of this type provide only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the complexity of Cisco configurations."
5,The Dirty Cowboy is oh sooooooooo dyrty!,"What a great book! Timberlake's dazzling wordsmithery set my tongue ablaze as I read it to my 3-year old companion. He loved Rex's intricate and entertaining art, especially the bugs, the snakes, the chaps-dwelling tumbleweed, and the lion; that is what he thought the dog looked like. The colloquialisms and regional dialect used in the book made it so much more interesting than a book filled with plain old everyday fare.Thoroughly enjoyable, a book we will read again & again. I so look forward to more from this author and the artist."
5,Get it back in print!,"One of the best books on anomalous events I have ever read. To often in reporting things such as bigfoot, UFOs, or the like, the event is merely ridiculed as a hoax or delusion or fit into an acceptable point of view, whether that viewpoint is scientific, theological or some form of common sense. Investigators of bigfoot usually try to explain it as some form of giant primate. In the Himalayas or the remote forests of the northwest that might be believable. But in Oklahoma? Ufologists usually try to stress how consistent the reports from around the world are, claiming that this shows that a single reality, a ""real"" reality, is behind them. They are anything but consistent. UFO encounters are weird. They don't fit a pattern, at least not that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. Patrick Harpur does not ""explain"" these events, but he does shed a great deal of light on them. I highly recommend his book if you are lucky enough to get a hold of a copy."
2,Daimonic Confusion,"I am almost through with this book, and after looking up the definitions of both the ""collective unconscious"" and ""anima mundi"", I still can't figure out what he is trying to say these things really are...the concept he is presenting is kind of interesting if you suspend any type of rational/critical thinking...they are both real and non-real? There are so many questions that come up while reading this book that it makes it very difficult to finish reading it. Having said that, I have learned a WHOLE lot about some ""paranormal"" manifestations that I never knew, so the book hasn't been a total loss."
3,beware of bulb,"If you look on the web, you'll see that these DLP's have a limited life span due to lamp-powered system, like a light bulb. The manual says 6000-8000 hrs, so like 1-2 years. Mine last exactly 2 months. Even if I'm watching it 24/7, it is no where near 6000 hrs.It does give a great picture while it was working. Make sure you get the extended warranty. You're going to need it."
1,Bring your own adhesive,"I purchased these for use in my car, but struggled to get past the installation phase. Namely, the adhesive was reluctant to separate from the fasteners and more often than not, the adhesive came off entirely on the liner. You may be better off super gluing the fastener, liner and all, to the intended surface. Your fingers will thank you."
3,Butterfly Kisses Musical Mobile,"Butterfly Kisses Musical Mobile matches Butterfuly Kisses Crib Ensemble which I was totally in love with. However, I was quite disappointed with the mobile. Two of the characters were beautiful butterflies, the other two were these scarey looking bug things. If they were butterflies at other stages, they did not look like it and they are quite inappropriate. They ruin the whole thing. I truly wanted to sent it back. However, I purchased it for a friend and she wouldn't let me. I could have found an all butterfly mobile somewhere that wouldn't scare baby to tears. Thumbs down to this! I took my chances with safety and sewed two additional butterflies and replaced the ugly bugs!"
5,"I admit it, I'm a cookbook junkie","I like cookbooks with lots of beautiful pictures and this one rates five stars for its pictures and interesting stories. I like recipes that use ingredients most of us have in our kitchens although recipes with the more exotic ingredients are welcome, too. Recipes have to be easy to prepare and not too time-consuming. Black Dog scores points here, also. But, the bottom line is, are you happy with the end result of all your labors and would you make the recipe again. So far, Black Dog fulfills this requirement with the recipes I have tried. For instance, the clam chowder recipe is excellent. I highly recommend this cookbook. I think it would make a great gift for the novice as well as ""seasoned"" cook."
1,"Flash in the pan, no substance","I Just don't get it. I got the book hoping to discover some wonderful and innovative new recipes. What I found instead was an advertisement for a restaurant. I just don't see what the big deal is. Adding fruit to pancakes and substituting vegetables for the canadian bacon in Eggs Benedict is hardly a brainstorm worth spending twenty dollars for. Other recipes call for outragously obscure ingredients. The outcome is seldom worth the pursiut of exotic items. I made the black bean clam thing...disgusting. My dog wouldn't even eat it. I recommend instead buying something like the new Joy of Cooking. It contains plenty of exotic and innovative recipes along with all of the basics. I guess I thought this would be a cookbook worthy of the shelf space it takes up. It turned out to be a slick, glossy, colorful brochure containing very little of value unless you are easily impressed with anything ""Vineyard""."
2,Save your money and go to You Tube,"The Product is ok, but the exact same type of video is available for free on You Tube. She just taught me how to glue tracks on a hair net not make a professional wig. I was dissapointed."
4,Great for Experts Like Me,... because it tells you how to boot single user and change the root password (just because you feel like it; a professional genius like me would never forget the root password). A lot more compact than the genuine HP manuals and almost as useful. See my full review at http://photo.net/wtr/bookshelf.html
5,Andy Kaufman -- Comedic Genius!,"If you thought you seen it all in Jim Carrey's version of ""Man on the Moon"", then you are definitely missing out on the original!""Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall"" is a must-have for all Kaufman fanatics! Filmed live within the hallowed Carnegie Hall, Andy takes the audience on a magical trip through his world!Whether it be Andy leading the audience in a sing-a-long of ""The Animal Says"" or ""Friendly World"", you'll laugh...cry...and remember what this comedic genius gave the world before his untimely death to cancer.Andy Kaufman was ""years ahead of his craft"" and this is one tape you MUST see.Andy's special guests are endless and there's one surprise guest you would never believe and have to see to believe it!Take home Andy today and relive the magic!"
2,Looks Nice But Brand New Clasp Broken... !,"The watch has opened several times in the short amount of time I've had it. I'm lucky that I caught it just in the nick of time, before it fell off and got lost and/or broken. I want to return it but Amazon has been so problematic already."
1,Is this a joke?,"I don't know if I received a bootleg or if this is for real. I just tried to watch it again and it IS as bad as I thought. First there are about 7 minutes of showing all the different kinds of rebounding you can do, but only 4 are supposedly on there. I wouldn't know since you cannot forward and there is no menu. Therefor, you can only watch the routines in order and if it is taken out of the dvd player you have to start all over. I won't go into how wacky some of the people seem, but I will also say that the video just pauses for no reason. I know it could be my player, but it doesn't do that with any other dvd. I am sure there is some good stuff in there, but how would I know?"
1,Sorry - But This is a Really Bad Urban Rebounder DVD!,"Let me preface this review by saying that I purchased the Urban Rebounding ""Power Compilation Pack"" with my 48"" rebounder. I found that compilation to be quite good for the money. Now; onto my review:I borrowed this DVD from my library through an interlibrary loan. I'm certainly glad I didn't spend any good money on it! It consists of 4 pretty horrible programs. Rather than critique each workout individually I would suggest you save your $$ & try it out through an interlibrary loan (ask your librarian). The unattractive models are usually out of sync with each other and the music. The workouts are low energy, low cardio and uninspiring. You and I would have a lot more fun and burn a lot more calories by just free form bouncing to our favorite tunes.Unlike the Power Compilation Pack (and by implication, presumably, Compilation #1), there is no fun here; nor is there any good cardio. I was thoroughly unimpressed!Chris"
5,Perfect.,"One of the many advantages of Allen-Edmonds is the ready availability of replacement insoles which perfectly fit their shoes. This fits their ""casual comfort"" shoes--which covers all but their top of the line shoes. The only bad thing is that cut lines aren't very clear on the insole--if you have an old insole you can use that as a guide to cut it to size."
4,A great read,"I loved this book--not for the plot, which comes across as immature a good deal of the time--but for the interplay between the main characters. Yes, the author tends to make Thea describe her feelings too us way too much (we don't need half the details we get!), and yes, she ends up chosing having her way over listening to her boyfriend's VERY REASONABLE concerns for her, but I still loved it. Thea is bright, sassy, has a great sense of humor, and doesn't let anybody walk on her. Don't expect too much depth or heart string tugging, but a great read if you want to laugh a lot."
3,Promising Beginning Leads to Nancy Drew Behavior,"This book began well, with an intriguing chapter from the point of view of the murder victim, but rapidly went downhill, to the point where I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been traveling in Italy and unable to get my hands on anything else in English. As the murders pile up, the heroine behaves more and more like Nancy Drew, doing foolish and unprofessional things so that she has to be rescued - and with constant references to similar behavior in past books that put her in the hospital. Well, duh.... Ultimately, a real let-down."
4,Solid Tight Swing an Unexpected Find,"This SACD really swings begining to end, it leaves you wanting more. Great playing from Harris, Hamilton and Ellis. The rhythm section is tight, they are as one. My taste leans towards more edge to my swing but they remain in the straight ahead swing pocket and it is absolutely wonderful. I have been playing this disc over and over again and letting others hear it. The audio quality is great and I would have given this 5 stars but I didn't care for multi channel mix. This is a nugget at this price. I have other stereo SACDs I paid much more for and do not enjoy as much."
1,Disappointing,I really enjoyed The Corrections and hoped that Strong Motion would be good as well. This book is a disappointing mess. The characters are unlikable and act completely at random. I suffered through as long as I could but finally quit when I got halfway through and completed a particularly random chapter. It simply isn't enjoyable to read.
1,"Wake Up Simmons, Your product needs WORK.","In my 59 years as a farm boy and then an engineer, I've seen some poorly designed products...and this one needs some work. Our water quality is quite good but my hydrants eventually begin to weep after it is shut down. I was sold these with the assurance by the sales person that the working/moving parts could be serviced above-ground. NOT-SO. The stem was so well stuck that I was sure that I was going to break it if I pulled any harder. So I reassembled the unit and worked the handle and adjusted the tension until it finally quit leaking. That is the last time I've used either of the units. Now these exist as legacy waste on my farm and a lesson learned. Don't buy these unless you want to dig them out of the ground after 3-4 years. Bad Product."
4,Baby book,Very cute book - colorful pages - bought it for a one year old and he lovesthe tactile pages.
4,MY BEST SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON!,I like that movie. I liked the part when Ash gets hypnotized and thinks he's a Bulbasaur. I loved the whole thing except when that pretty girl's Grandmother tried selling Ash Misty and Brock potion that grows hair on your nose and tongue.
2,Not the Best,I did not really like this DVD very much at all. Not much to say other than it just isn't the best workout in my opinion.
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE PICTURE,"I saw the reviews saying that the clear cup wasn't delivered and I double checked the picture, page, and description. Sure enough,the clear cup did not arrive. I did not want the travel cup and I do not want the protein-shake cup that arrived. Don't make the purchase unless the foggy plastic cup is the one you want!"
4,Continuing the Tradition,"Typical Thomas stays true to type in a story based on the Reverend W.Awdry`s The Railway Series. Colorful illustrations of Thomas and the gang (Sir Topham Hatt looks a bit transformed) grace this tidy little tale, as our loveable but cheeky Thomas learns a lesson. Nearly every child will understand how Thomas` excitement and overconfidence lead him to go too fast and not listen to the good advice of his friends. Everyone has felt that horrible sinking feeling he gets when he doesn`t know where he is, as well as his shame at his behaviour. And we`ll all root for him as he learns his lesson and resolves to become a Really Useful Engine."
4,Two boys' review: Lesson for kids: don't get overexcited and forget to listen,"I like this story because it addresses a problem a lot of young children have when they get overexcited. They forget to listen.Thomas is chosen to run on new tracks and in his excitement he fails to listen to advice from Sir Topham Hatt, Edward and Thomas' driver.We have several other Thomas books that were regulars in our bedtime reading collection. I say ""were"" because my sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old and both are a little too old for these picture books. Aim to read these with your 2-3-year olds."
4,Unusual bokken,"I bought this to use as a Chokut&#333; Bokken. Its made from a single piece of wood so it holds together well, but the wood is quite fragile which could be the species or the quality of the wood. The rubber habaki that is used to secure the tsuba is smaller than a normal habaki so its good that they supply it as the sword is smaller than a regular bokken."
4,Low-tech language promoter,"Our 3 year old loves this video. It is very ""low-tech,"" being composed of old video clips. I was worried that she would be afraid of some of the darker characters (like Baba Yaga), but she thinks they are funny. It is a great way to help your bilingual child build on her vocabulary and language concepts. Although we do not otherwise let our children watch TV at all, this video is worth it, for educational purposes."
2,Art Deco Fashion,"This book would have been better titled Art Deco Fashion of the 1920s. If you are interested in the entire span of art deco fashion that includes the 1930s, this isn't the book for you. Although the inside jacket says it was written to coincide with a major exhibition Art Deco 1910-1939, the 30s are all but forgotten.If you are looking fr a book that covers fashion of the entire period, look elsewhere."
4,"oh boy, I cried.",Beautiful pictures with beautiful music. It's not a story of dog. It's a story about a boy in 19 century in Belgium. Great movie expecially if you have a dog. Recommended.
5,Excellent!,I read this book and I couldn't put the book down. I gained siginificant insight into antebellum politics. One felt triumphant once the issue of slavery was finally debated.
1,nothing.,"It is too boring,Exercise video ( on my opinion ) should be cheerfull so i could do with more fun."
3,"Not bad for a review text, but no answer key","I was looking for a review text to refresh my high-school French when I came across this book. I liked the many exercises, although some seemed a bit juvenile for an adult. The main thing the book lacks is an answer key. This limits its usefulness as a review text for independent study."
1,Lackluster interpretations,"I was a little surprised at the lackluster interpretations that these concertos had from Cortese. I am a huge fan of these works, and I highly prefer the versions of the Der Schwanendreher (Albany Records) and Konzertmusik (Old Louisville recording) by Raphael Hillyer, and the Kammermusik by Kashkashian. This disc is about equal in quality to the Brett Dean recording of the Hindemith Concertos (with Queensland Symphony Orchestra), which is equally lackluster. Overall, these interepretations are somewhat unimaginative. I missed the quicker tempos of the fast movements heard in the Hillyer versions, especially the 3rd movement of the Konzertmusik and the last movement of the Der Schwanendreher. The tone quality in the Kashkashian Kammermusik is far superior."
3,Overly Scratched but good.,"Nothing new on this release, however the song selections are standout. Only for the DJ Shadow devoted. I also felt it was overly scratched by Qbert.I will say this, it has the best version of Organ Donor I've ever heard."
3,Interesting,I had to get this book for class and I actually found it interesting. It is case after case of situations and how school law applies in the cases.
2,Medicore B-Movie,"This movie starts out trying to be the Christmas verison of ""Halloween"" but quickly fails with bad acting and bad special effects."
4,"Useful, but not sturdy at all","I used these for personalized tags for my bridesmaid bags. I thought they were going to be sturdier - with a hard plastic back, but they are simply the laminate sheets with a tie. They weren't what I expected, but they still work! For the price, they're great, but I was just expecting something a little different."
5,Fantastic German Movie,Kind of a Trainspotting meets Sliding Doors in the Matrix all blended to Run Lola Run. The soundtrack is a mixture of techno and fast pumping tunes that perfectly matches the film.
4,Half and Half,"The first half of this album is A vibrant techno rush which manages to trancend the usual boundaries of language (you know what I mean, albums by foreign artists singing in English usually sound awful) and carries you along on a wave of adrenaline, much like the film. However, if you're not a big fan of remixes then the second half will probably leave you cold. There are numerous reworkings of the earlier pieces, none of them different enough from the original to make them stand out. Aworthwhlie purchase on the first half alone, it's a pity that they couldn't get the licensing for 'What a difference a day makes'."
4,"Pretty stable, easy to control","I've used this while blading/running/in the car and it's held up. Even used it for most the year as my primary cd player (hooked up to the computer speakers). I've been a little rougher with this model than I would a non-sport discman, and it's taken the moderate abuse well. Love the ""rocker"" button that controls track, stop, play/pause functions. If they somehow intergrated volume into that one button I'd be a happier camper, but still it's very convenient to have those features in one area. The Bass mode fine, Groove muddies the vocals and higher notes too much for me. The little rubber ""plug"" for the headphone jack popped off, but since you'll have the headphones plugged in there anyway it isn't too great a loss. Happy customer-- this one has held up better than my previous ESP discman from 3 years ago. Buying it as a Christmas present for friend."
2,Disappointing,"After seeing the reviews and reading so much about John Rechy's novels I feel that maybe I missed something that other readers 'got'. I found this novel to be confusing from the outset. He introduced too many characters and had them not only all talking to each other - but Rechy would also throw in tidbits of feelings and why this person felt the way he did. I found it difficult to keep track of who was talking to who! It seemed the entire book consisted mainly of these 4 people talking, talking. Too me the story didn't move anywhere. I finally started skimming the pages looking for something more that the unending conversation. Finally I read the last chapter in which the same characters were still conversing! Extremely disappointing and a time-waster!"
5,xmas present,So far so good. I bought these for my son. I'll have to wait for Dec 25. what a suprised. He didn't think they made these in his size.
1,But can we store it?,Can someone comment on whether it would be as easy to break these chairs down for storage as it apparently is to assemble them?
5,TOO BAD WE WILL NOT HAVE ANOTHER STORY FROM THIS AUTHOR,"This is a fascinating story about psychiatry, crime, relationships, serial killers and the police department. Any mystery fan should love this book. Well worth your time. It's just a shame Mr. Izzi is not around to write more winners like this one."
5,It's truly amazing,"This truly is one of the best live recordings I've ever heard. It shows what a magnificent live band Pearl Jam really is. It's as if one is taken on a musical journy. The sound of the audience in the backgroung is just hypnotizing. One also gets the chance to hear some of the magic between the musicians. Matt's drumming, Mike's exquisite guitar playing, Jeff's never ending base lines, Stone's captivating rythm, and Eddie's deep voice. It's a must for every serious music lover."
3,Light and Fluffy!,"A somewhat far fetched story line with so, so acting. Not for all around family viewing given the subject matter."
5,One of the best of the series,"Generally the Hamburg and Milan sets have been forwarded as the best of Pearl Jam's 2000 European Tour, and whereas I cannot wholeheartedly be that enthusiastic about Hamburg, this is really one of a kind. Play is great, the recording is above average as well but what makes this such a unique set is a fantastic audience, which even took the band aback at some stages. You really feel sorry for not having been there when you listen to this one. Unfortunately I missed them at Werchter (the show was understandably cancelled due to the Roskilde incident the day before) but these CDs almost make up for it."
3,It's just okay,I am an avid fitness fan. I read a lot of health and fitness books. This book was just okay. I didn't feel like it gave any real definitive information that would be helpful. It was more like a story book to me... nothing really useful in it. I'd say save your money and try a different one.
2,Anticipating mental fatigue...,I returned the book. Cumbersome. Not what I expected after a promo on TV had gotten me interested. Signed up and doing Jazzercise instead.
2,Wont recommend,"A detailed account of a woman growing up in polygamous society.. the author goes too much into details about the history of polygamy and the backgrounds of her way too many characters in the book.. does not get confusing but annoying after a while, I dont think I'd recommend this book!"
5,Edgardale's Racehorse,"Edgardale has enough money to finally buy a stallion! They buy 3-year-old racer Royal Renegade. He wins his first race, but after being bred to a few mares, he starts to lose races and becomes mean. Ashleigh sees pictures and reads about another horse like him. Does this have anything to do with Renegade's strange behavior? Read it and find out. This book was very interesting!"
5,A great gift for a Modern Family fan!,"I knew my wife loved Modern Family, but I also knew she didn't really start watching until near the end of the first season. Amazon had the whole first season on DVD, and I thought, why not see if she likes this as a birthday gift? Probably one of the best gift decisions I've ever made. Except even though she watches the show religiously on TV, I also know she's going to EXPECT to get Season 2 on DVD as soon as it comes out. Amazon, please keep me in mind when it does!"
3,Modern family?,"This is by no means a ""modern family"". And who the heck does the filming on this show? It's HORRIBLE."
5,Modern Family,This movie came to me in a very precise time frame. It was packaged very well and was in great condition.
5,Modern Family Complete Second Season,"I was expecting nothing else but pure family comedy and that is what I got in three discs of hilarious content. I'm very happy with purchasing Modern Family second season. I encourage to those who they don't have it yet to go for it, you won't regret it!"
5,LOL,Everyone I know of all ages just loves and adores this show!!!!!!!Great castWon many awardsConstant laughterSimply wonderful
2,First season the best by far,"I think the second season is not as good as the first season. I had gotten my daughter hooked by ordering the first season so I had to order the second. It did not compare. Although, the package arrived very quickly..it was a big dissapointment."
4,Like gettin' run over by the devil's hot rod,"No surprises here for those familiar with the Scandinavian school of punk-tinged, boozed-out rock exemplified by Gluecifer or the Hellacopters. Though it breaks no new ground, this platter is still an excellent rock-n-roll kick in the teeth. Tight, concise songwriting is aided and abetted by Tomas Skogsberg's characteristic fuzzy, speaker-maxxing production.Highlights include:Get Your Head Straight - Opens the album like a punch in the face, with an intro riff that'll peel the racing stripes off your vintage Firebird.Roll With the Punches - A classic, rippin' song about payin' the devil his due and bein' down on your luckAll in all, an excellent album if you want high-octane, low-brain-cell rock. Should appeal to fans of MC5, the Hellacopters, and Entombed alike."
2,Should have been named BMW company,"The book is a good read if you are interested in the history of the BMW company, but it has very little information on the cars themselves. The writing is correct and entertaining. The pictures are of correct quality even if they tend to look like they were taken from a sales brochure. An easy read for the BMW or car history fanatic."
5,They're still one of the best,"I just want to say that Pearl Jam is amazing on this records, they are still one of the best live groups around, this CD has a good set and very good new versions of old songs like immortality, but especially Daughter when Eddie shows the crowd that he is a great singer, also has a good version of Timeless Melody. The band show that they are better musicians than before, Mike is playing incredibly well, and Matt is really a good drummer I guess that the best Pj. ever had. I just hope that one day Pearl Jam visit Costa Rica, i really love that to happen."
3,Goodbye Walter,"At first I was a little confused about who this book was about, Walter or RuthAnn. But as I finished the first chapter, I realized that it is about both of them and how Walter's terminal illness enlightened him about his life's purpose and the difference that he made and touched RuthAnn's life in profound ways as well. Isn't that the meaning of enlightenment? I think that it is showing another, by example, something that makes a difference in their own life and transforms them. Through her relationship with Walter, his wife and his friends, RuthAnn began to see life through a different, more empowering avenue and she made more positive choices. I appreciated the opportunity to get close to people that I would not have otherwise gotten to know and realize again, how precious and wonderful it is to be alive....it's not about me....all the time!"
3,need software,i need software becuase this product locks up in windows me it just doesn't seem too work it worked fine in windows 98 thats allthank youdonald
5,HELP,"This is a request for ""HELP"".I want to purchase a HP e-scanner that is compatible with my webtv plus receiver.What models are available (model no,s) and cost, can I order on line?? from who?? What info is available for webtv plus receiver use??? pmigloo@webtv.net"
3,OK Scanner,"This HP Scanner is OK, but it doesn't work well when you scan in small objects. So the trick is to put something behind it to make the scanner think that it is a larger object so it will come out well. The software that comes with it is great. The hookup is easy, but it has no off button."
2,Not the best HP,This scanner is a great starter scanner. It was my first scanner. The only problem I had was it grinding and clicking. It's only a year or two old. The first year it worked great. Don't bother trying to call HP - there number is a '900' number. ....
5,Good quality and comfort!,"Shirt is durable and perfect for work. I am a true Medium. I ordered this shirt in Medium and it seemed big for being a medium, but after washing and tumble drying, the size fits as a perfect Medium. Love this shirt and I wear it all the time."
5,Good Quality,Good quality shirt ordered for a Christmas present for my son. He is rather tall and lanky. The shirt fits him well.
1,Fraud,"This guy is a fake. The book is ok. The author has no business writing about this topic. After purchasing a $39 ebook from his that did not deliver on the promise, I tried to get a refund and couldn't. I did some research on him and it turns out he has NO experience as a marketer. He's a general writer who's sold a lot of articles. He has NO business talking about ""empire building"" or ""nich marketing"". Besides the fact that he is extremely unprofessional in his business dealings."
4,OT Review Cards in a Box,I felt these cards were convient and easy to follow. I am using them for review for my certification exam. I do believe that these cards would be helpfull to use in school. The thing I like most is you can carry this info in a box and its easier than using 2-3 books and notes from class
5,It works !,i installed this all inside the truck of my Acura TL took me a few hours; but the 5 sheets did the job; reduces rood noise as well. It will add a few pounds to your car; but not bad for the price.
2,"Good filtration, but","Bags provide good filtration, but when in use the main seams often open leaving dirt and debris in the vacuum. So far every bag in use has done this. From now on I will reinforce the seam with staples and/or duct tape."
2,design to fail,"We have been using the Portor Cable vacuums for about 15 years as a drywall company. We started with the previous model 7810. The new 7812 is a vast improvement over the old one, excluding the bags. The old bags you could empty and reuse until they were wore out maybe 5 times. The glue to hold them together held well. The 7812 bags are glued with extremely weak glue. If you're not careful when installing them the flange will separate. The seam on the back of the bag often blows out while vacuuming. Even with extreme care dumping the bags is next to impossible without ruining the bag. I believe the new bags were engineered so you could not reuse them and they succeeded."
2,Cracks Easily,"This exact tote can be bought from Lowe's for thirteen dollars. The top flaps are awkward. But worst of all, I dropped it on accident and it cracked, sending my papers everywhere. Not recommended."
1,Great product but beware of price on Amazon.,"I been using these for years to store seasonal stuff. We like them because you can lose the lid and they stack really well. BUT, do not buy them online, they are way over priced! You can get them at just about any HW store for about $13, sometimes on sells for less than $8! Shop around and you will sure find a better deal, the cost of shipping just jacks the price too high to buy online."
5,Porch!!!,"At long last, after hearing shouted requests on previous Bootlegs for ""Porch"", Pearl Jam let's it loose. This is a down to earth, no frills show that I frequently find myself coming back to more frequently than the fabled Milan or Hamburg shows. The band's playing and the adoration evidenced by this neglected part of their fan base is part of the reason. It's a shame this could not have been one of the longer shows in the tour. This release is now one of the harder to find ones of the series, so expect to pay a premium for it if you find it. It's worth the price. Oh, and did I tell you it has ""Porch""?"
1,Unresponsible recording,"If you have respect for the beautful Vivaldi bassoon concerti, do not buy and support these recordings. Daniel Smith is sloppy, has little regard for intonation, and is not musically expressive. There are thousands of bassoonists that could play better, and these popular bassoon recordings are undermining their ability. This is not what a great recording should sound like. So if you are searching for a proper representation of the glory of Vivaldi, search elsewhere. Unfortunately the search for a good recording will be a little harder, but at least you will spend your money on something respectable."
4,"Great, BUT is Too predictable!","I love this series, but they are all the same now! hopefully the new ones are a bit better, cuz the last few are still awsome, but u just know wuts gonnna happen!"
1,huge disappointment,"If you are yu-gi-oh fanatic this may be the calendar for you because it is essentially NOT a calendar but a giant poster in disguise. The so called calendar part is so small (it takes up 1/6 of the page space) you can't put anything written in the 1/2"" by 1/2"" blocks. Even if you could the background is red or burnt orange so you can't even see what you wrote.If you want giant yu-gi-oh characters on your wall this is for you.If you want a CALENDAR buy something else."
5,The definitive guide to entrepreneurship,"The thousands of budding entrepreneurs in the world share many common pitfalls. Among them is the need for adequate information regarding financing their dreams and a workable, usable, and meaningful plan of action. This book, by one of the country's leading professors of entrepreneurship, and others, is the definitive guide to mapping a viable and long-term plan of action for entrepreneurial success."
3,Mmmm not quit,"Don't bother getting this now, the series is out-of-date, try a newer 'Hiro Mashima' Sensei series.Might just be me but this type of style just doesn't work for me...... I found myself read it, then getting the next book 2, then on to the next. but something just didn't feel right, not connecting at all here."
4,Great tasting tea,"This is one of the best peppermint teas I have ever tasted. It is much stronger than the bag teas you will find in local grocery stores. I purchased it to help calm my IBS and it really does a good job of calming the GI. My only complaint is that I wish the bag was resealable. I had to purchase a tea canister because you cannot keep it in this bag without loosing the effects of the tea. If you want really strong tea, then (in my opinion) follow the package directions. I have had to water it down a bit because the peppermint oil is a bit too strong for my system. The bag is huge and a little really goes a long way. I am sure this will last for several months. Be sure to by a nice tea infuser - this is the best way to enjoy this tea. I purchased the Adagio Teas Personal sized tea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket and it is working well."
3,"Adequate performance, substandard sound","I wanted to add the DVD to my 5.1 surround sound collection of concerts because most of Crow's hits I liked. Although her performance is adequate enough, I didn't care for some of the less-well-known songs. Mainly, however, the sound mix is pretty bad. The stereo is weak, the Dolby Digital 5.1 is almost as bad as the stereo, with little definition. The DTS is almost adequate, but not quite. It is nowhere near as good as the James Taylor ""Pull Over"" DVD or the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD. It's not even as good as the marginally acceptable Nora Jones ""Live in New Orleans"" DVD. But if you're a Sheryl Crow fan, go ahead and add this to your collection. You might be reasonably satisfied."
2,Too Colorful,"The ball is baby blue, with a little white and navy. Not the most manly ball... good thing my dog ate it, gave me an excuse to get a new one!"
3,Interesting,Explains the development of the patriarchal system of the Bible and the decline of the goddess.
4,Thoroughly hilarious and family friendly,"As the title of this review says, this book is thoroughly hilarious and family friendly. My mom read this book aloud to my sisters and I, and we all LOVED it!! My mom has read it many times since then, and I'm reading her copy. My sister didn't want to wait to read it again, so she got another copy from the library. The book is about a 15-year-old boy, pea brained Simon Greene, who tries to take 1000 turkeys to Denver. GUARANTEED family fun!!"
5,"I said, ""Can you funk?""","HFC is the best Dallas band around these days. They have a kickn' stage show, with thumpn' beats, and slammin' lyrics that you can't help but ""funk"" to. I'm apart of the Hellafied Family and always will be."
1,Ahhhh!! It burns... OMG it burns!!! Get it off me!!!,"Okay. I'm not sure if it's just me, but why would anyone create a face lotion that makes your eyeballs feel like they've been to the fiery Pits of Mordor and back? I know the label specifically states not to use around the eye, but I think most people who buy face lotion expect to apply liberally to the face. Anyways, I expected more out of Cetaphil. I've tried a variety of their other products and have been very satisfied with them (ie. Cleansing bar, and other lotions and cremes). But this bottle of Mount Doom Lava, I cannot recommend."
2,Decent mouisturizer but smells BAD,"I like the consistency of this lotion and think it does ok as a moisturizer HOWEVER it smells bad... sorta like bug spray. So, if you want to walk around with that kind of stink of your face all day then by all means, purchase this."
3,History can be different,"This book has twelve stories about historical events in which a historian asks him- or herself what would have happened if that event had happened differently.The historical events in this book are divers. I read a couple of them, for example about the landing of the Spanish armada in England, about the victory of Napoleon in Russia, about Staling fleeing Moskow, about the succesvol bombing on Margaret Thatcher, about the victory of Al Gore.I really liked reading how these events could have turned out. Some stories would have ended the same, like the story about Stalin. Even without him in Moskow there would have been a very violent period in Russia. He was one of many....I thought this book was a fascinating read and I recommend this to anybody who loves history. Especially if you're sometimes wondering about things going differently."
3,vampire cliche,"Has bits and pieces of action and continues with the theme of a depressed vampire detective, or as the often used joke ""vampire dick,"" who is constantly fighting the urge to drink the blood of a live human. Ending is semi-unpredictable, and most everything is described in great detail."
1,Only 1 left in stock? PLEASE DON'T ORDER IT!!!!!!,"The word 're-mixed' is used here to give the impression that there might just be another version of these tracks in the vault. If there were other versions they would wind up in the garbage. Don't be fooled by the title, there is NOTHING here that even resembles ABBA and this crap should NOT be listed here under their [ABBA] good name.Way to go AMAZON! Now I've got to find a sucker to buy the only other copy of this crap in existence!"
5,Working great so far.,The price was nice and these rotors seems to do the job well with no screeches or problems with the build. I use ceramic breaks with them and they fit the Honda Civic 2006 perfectly.
1,Horrible video quality on this DVD...0 stars!!,I'd like to give this 0 stars. By far the worst video and audio quality on a DVD ever. How the other reviewer came up with 4 stars is beyond me! Pass on this one!
1,I wish there were negative stars....,"The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).The DVD player completely fails to recognize them. Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed. More Taiwanese junk. (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments."
1,Does not work,"I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work. This stuff is junk. In addition, the manufacturernever sent the rebate. Don't buy anything from Velocity."
2,Too stiff,"The Dickies Chambray shirt is pretty good and quite duarable but the button below the top collar button is positioned too low. The biggest problem however is that the fabric is too stiff. I've owned this shirt for about three + years and it never softened up. It looks and feels a little odd because it is so stiff. I'm not too picky about shirts but never really liked it, I was just too cheap to toss it or give it away."
3,Work shirt,"I bought this shirt for my husband who likes to do yard work and I wanted something that would protect his arms, as well as save his dressier shirts from destruction. The shirt is quite roomy enough, but the material is quite stiff, even after laundering. I'm hoping it will eventually ""break in"" and be comfortable while serving the purpose."
1,Intro Astrophotography,"I found that this book consists of a group of introduction essays that leave more questions unanswered then it answers. If you are looking for a good guide to astrophotography, look elsewhere. It does have nice pictures, however it is very unlikely that you would be able to produce such images on the just the information within the book.Jon Bosley"
2,"Soft, comfortable but would not buy again","These work gloves are soft, comfortable but I would not buy again. I've been using these gloves for outdoor yard work for four months and every time my hands become sweaty the dye in the leather turns my hands orange. It takes several days for the dye on my hands to fade. I thought with some use and age they would stop this but the gloves are dying my hands just as strongly after four months as the first day I used them."
3,a solid first novel for Tim Green,"Perhaps familiar for his NFL service as a defensive lineman for the Atlanta Falcons, a game commentator for Fox Sports, or as the author of the nonfiction book The Dark Side of the Game, Tim Green is becoming an entertaining fiction writer as well. In Ruffians, he begins a formula of focusing on a star NFL player who must make tough choices when facing corruption and scandal involving his NFL team. In this book the player is a highly drafted rookie (a defensive lineman no less) who gets caught between a rock and a hard place when his new franchise is led by an owner who pushes illegal performance-enhancing drugs and a coach who simply wants the players who are performing on the field to get the playing time."
1,cheep cheep cheep,"man dont belive this the add says solid steel, ok it is pop matel not a real ninja shogee, the chain is cheep it not even a good wallet chain, I guess I can make a Halloween Costume to put it on."
3,a solid fixer upper,"the good things about this shogee is it has a good amount of sturdy chain, a durable ring, and its a really fun weapon. i'd give it five stars after i finish fixing it up. my plan is to put an edge on it (it comes unsharpened), affix the chain in a more durable way, and wrap the grip.the handle might slip on you if you have sweaty hands. the chain hasnt broken on me, but it looks like it is weakest at the handle. finally, i like to have sharp weapons. this is up to you though. maybe you'd just like to train with it.i reccomend this to martial artists, collectors, or someone who likes ninjas and doesnt mind doing a little work to make their ninja weapons perfect."
3,There's got to be limits,"This CD includes probably the second most popular organ piece in the world, Toccata, Op. 42. I would rate Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D minor as the most poular one.Anyway, there's no doubt that Jane Parker-Smith is an incredible performer, but just listen to the tempo she uses in the mentioned Toccata: She's playing so fast, you dont have the chance to do it articulated. This is entirely against Widors will. In his days, he was pleased with the success this single piece gave him, but he was not at all happy about those who played the piece too fast. Like Parker-Smith indeed does on this recording.Of course, this is a brilliant recording, nice sound quality, and I'm sure many Widor fans would like to add this one to their collection, but I wouldn't have done it."
3,"Cute story, Chinese 'fairy tale' with English soundtrack!","This was a cute story, a Chinese 'fairy tale' about a boy who 'finds' a magical gourd in a lake in a bamboo forest, who makes all kind of magical things come true...The Magic Gourd makes all his 'dreams' & wishes come to life, but of course, manages to make a mess of things along the way. When things start to go pretty haywire, he must figue out what is really important & how to turn things back around!I liked this short, 85-minute film, but it was a bit jarring to start the movie & see that the soundtrack did not match up to what the characters lips were saying: it was only then that I looked closely at the back of the DVD & saw that this was an English soundtrack, to what is apparently a Chinese foreign film ~ recommended to people who are interested in a family-friendly (G rated), slightly 'different' fairy tale, that teaches life lessons, just like fairy tales usually do!"
2,poorly exectuted movie!,This is supposed to be a kids movie but it's originally in Japanese or something other than English.While the graphics seem to be pretty well done and all my niece and nephew just didn't like it.My nephew complained several times that the voices didn't match the way their mouths moved and he's only 5 and a half. Typically they both will just sit there and watch a movie no matter what it is and not move. They had absolutely no interest in this one. I think because it's dubbed in English.I even had a hard time watching this one as it was dubbed very badly. The only way for this to be any better would have been to subtitle it but then you have the problem of this is a child's movie.....!!!!! They can't read that good!All in all I think this was a waste of a movie! Might have been good in the original language for those that can understand it and all but not for English speaking children....
2,"Good Artists, Bad songs! (Well some bad artists, too.)","This CD is horrible. I love you Skye Sweetnam, but what were you thinking when you did that song? I was really disappointed when I heard it. And who the heck is Fan-3? The songs are corny, the singers lack talent, and it doesn't sound very Christmas-y. It just doesn't sound festive. The only song I thought was half-decent was Jesse McCartny's ""Winter Wonderland"" because it was a classic, and he has a decent voice. Stacie Orrico was OK, too. But for the rest of the artists on here, DON'T BOTHER!"
1,Price increased by 100%,Overpriced since it is not name brand. Just a few days ago this press was $150 on Amazon.
3,"Dog loves it...owner, not so much.","My dog loves, loves, loves this toy. However, the sounds that it makes it extremely annoying to the rest of us. The sound chip is very sensitive so it sounds off easily. He loves it."
5,EXPLOSIONS,"This is when The Invisibles enters the cream stage of its existence, smoothly entering the minds of the readers with the beautiful art of Phil Jimenez and action-filled experimental narrative set to make your mind trip. If you've never read the book, this might be the place to start since it's less literary than the first volume, and the first 25 issues can always be revisited if you like what you see here."
4,"Good, straightforward, hardworking rock'n'roll","I saw 27 West live in the Village when they opened for Earth to God, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The five-piece band rocks very tightly together, with a blue-collar style of rock that I thought we'd lost when the E-Street Band stopped touring.Though they claim Journey and Billy Joel as their strongest influences, I would actually have to guess they've been listening to REO Speedwagon (earlier ""Ridin' the Storm Out"" days, before they got all ballady and cheesy), but luckily they have stronger vocalists. Creative keyboard hooks and jangly, layered guitars make for some strong orchestration here.I don't buy CDs at live shows very often, but this was an exception. I'll go see these guys play again, and I'm looking forward to their second CD in early 2001."
2,Where's the editor?,"If you find it difficult reading books with grammatical and punctuation errors, do not buy this book. On the first page alone I found eight such errors. The author has some good ideas about playing guitar better but he communicates them very poorly. He needs to hire a professional editor for his next edition."
4,"Great sound, poor remote","I've had my 3090 for about a year and love the sound. It has plenty of inputs for all my A/V equipment and looks great as a centerpiece for my system. I have the matching 200 disk player, and being able to see the names of every song on every CD on my remote is cool. As I said before, the sound is outstanding. On the bad side, while seeing all the cd song names on the remote is cool, it was a BIG pain to setup. The rest of the system setup was no better or worse then any other system. The remote does become more conversation piece then usefull tool because it is so slow to respond, but very quick to ""go to sleep"". I generally still use my component remote controls for just about everything except switching components or volume. All in all I like the system, but Kenwood really came up short on the remote. If they could have gotten that one item to work better then this would be a first class system."
4,"A party for the ears, addendum 2002","The other review on this page by me is for an out of print edition conducted by Pierre Boulez. The item being sold on this page does not contain any of the non Chamber Concerto recordings and I do not own it. For whatever reason, ... transferred this review from there to here, possibly because nobody else had reviewed it at the time. ... should feel free to eliminate that and this review. (You gave me no outlet to contact you via other means.)My opinion of the Chamber Concerto still stands (hence the 4 stars, I didn't want to throw off the average), though I would recommend the recent Ligeti supervised Teldec recording."
5,Excellent!,"The ""For Lovers Only"" series by Itzy Records is loaded with Great Songs and ""The Mad Mike Album"" doesn't disappoint."
2,Works for data backup only..,This media is good only for data backup. Try burning a video and most of the times the DISC skips in the middle of the playback. First I thought it was my burner porblem but then found that it happens only with this media.
1,Velocity changed manufactures,I just received my package today. I placed an order for these back in October. Everyone was saying that they had received good quality MCC discs. I opened my package and tested my discs. They are now Optodisc OR8s. This is some of the worst media around. I tested the discs with my plextor drive. None of the discs would burn correctly at 8X. A few would burn at 6X. A few more at 4X. And most just came up and told me that they would not burn correctly at any speed. I am going back to ordering discs I know to be of good quality. I have tossed the discs into the trash and with them my money. Do yourself a favor and do not buy these.
1,They Were Great...Not Now,I bought 200 of these last year and Every disk was good. Now they've changed to or8 instead of velocity. They will not play in some dvd players after written. I get Uknown disk on 2/3 of the dvd players. I've sent one order back and experimented til i was blue in the face with another hoping for the quality I had come to expect.
1,Deer Hunter GB Color,This game is not very challenging at all. It is way to easy and the gameplay is boring. Do not waste your money on this game.
4,Pure and Simple,"Original String Band members Robin and Clive got together following the Robin and Mike reuinion to produce this lovely collection of mostly traditional songs. Robin, as usual, plays a wide variety of instruments while Clive sticks mainly to banjo and pipes. Robin's wife Bina contributes simple but effective backing vocals and keyboard genius Lawson Dando provides understated support throughout. Highlights include Clive's sombre but uplifting ""Paris"" and Robin's Jacobite lament ""Waes Me For Prince Charlie"", but there's plenty of fun stuff here as well, much of it recalling the good-natured feel of the first ISB album. Not an incredible album then, but an honest and truly enjoyable one."
1,Do NOT buy this movie!,"Do not buy this movie! I know you & I have read many BAD reviews here on Amazon, but it is not possible to sit through this movie! And NO it's not one of those BAD movies that are so bad they are funny or campy. I don't care how much you've smoked it's just that BAD! This movie is just HORRID!"
5,for great results,"if during a dogfight you try to move your head and look above the screen but nothings happend, this is the product for you!!!"
4,"Mostly strums, but worth it for that","Ralph Shaw teaches ukulele strums in a thoroughly engaging manner. This is good stuff to know, and it's easily worth the price, considering what you'd pay a tutor. Given time, you might figure it out for yourself, but the time/progress ratio is worth the money. I wouldn't call this course ""complete,"" but these strums and a couple chords can get you started.I learned some good stuff about steady down-up chung chukka chukka chung etc rhythms that helped me nail down several new songs. Considering movies are $10/two hours, this DVD (and an ukulele) is good return on the entertainment dollar."
2,"Worth $10, not $30","I bought this based on the many rave reviews, but was disappointed. I've been playing the ukulele for about 2 months, and was looking for something to really accelerate my progress. In particular, I was hoping for good instruction on right-hand technique.I really enjoyed learning the split strum. Unfortunately, although the section on right-hand strums covers the basic split strum slowly and in detail, all of the variations and embellishments are explained outside the context of the basic strum, then shown in context only at full speed. This made it very difficult to figure EXACTLY out how to incorporate embellishments such as the initial double strum, the thumb roll, etc. into the context of the basic technique. It would have helped tremendously if each new element was shown slowly and in close-up (in useful context).The DVD format has tons of data capacity and potential for a great instruction disc. Why not at least have a section where each technique is shown in slo-mo?"
5,Wonderful Book about the Midwest,"This is a wonderful book for anyone hoping to learn more about the history of middle America. The author capably takes the reader through centuries of midwestern history in just a few hundred pages, covering everything from early Native Americans to Tecumseh, Robert De La Salle, William Henry Harrison, George Rogers Clark, and Anthony Wayne. The book also includes a geographical guide to historical sites of note throughout the midwest."
5,Haunting of Alaizabel Cray,"Thenial is a 17 year old wych-hunter in an alternative Victorian England, where magic is king. With his partner, Catheline, he lurks the streets of Old London for the wych. On patrol one night, he is smitten by a mysterious young woman named Alaizabel Cray. He learns that she is pocessed by a wych named Thatch and has escaped from a deadly cult called ""The Fratnity"" who wants to take over the world.Thenial, Catheline and Alaizabel must destroy Thatch and ""The Fratnity"" before they destroys society.This book is one of my all time favorites. I would recommand this to any fanstay fan."
1,Does not do the work for which it is made,I checked the productdoes not workIt does not destroy the needlesI had to do it so many times to get the positioning rightthen too it failed to completely destroy the needleI tried contacting the company making itseems it is closed down. No wonder .I recommend not to buy this product even if it seems cheapIt is a waste
1,Too many errors!,"Too bad it is so poorly edited. When you have to stop the flow of reading to try to figure out what a word is supposed to be, it ruins the language and interferes with the author's style. I bet it is a good book, but I have no idea because I could not stand to actually read it! (And Amazon was a little stubborn about refunding my money too!)"
1,idiots guide to loosing money,"House prices only go up, so it's ok to buy houses with10% down and let the tenants pay for your mortgage.If this sounds like a business plan to you i suggestyou recalibrate your calculator. Before anybody starts implememting the ideas in this book, I strongly recommend to stop by at REI and buy a tent, so they have a place to stay after the next correction in the housing market."
2,O.K. For First Read,"Fortunately for me, this was the first book I have read on Real Estate Investing, so the book's general overview on this subject was not as maddening to me as it seems to be to the more experienced investors who have reviewed this book. However, I whole-heartedly agree with them that there is a serious lack of detail to the process of getting started in real estate investing. Yes, some ideas of his are enlightening, but I could no more apply for an investment mortgage now than I could before reading this book. So my novice advice to you is that if you want to get enthused by Dolf de Roos' successes in New Zealand, than you'll enjoy this info-mercial. Otherwise, do like I am and continue your research for more comprehensive material. - mike"
1,Lack of substance,"The author does injustice to the Rich Dad series. The book's title is horribly misleading. The book lacks substance, and is only a motivational book that ""touches"" on why someone should get into real estate. Even if you have the smallest amount of knowledge on how to invest in real estate, do not purchase this book; you can find many other books with greater information.The author tries to upsell his other material in the book ""for further reading"" and fails to disclose any useful information about real estate in this book. I speak very highly of the Rich Dad series, and this one does not belong in it; very disappointing."
3,Stand up!,"This book of poetry feels more like a volume of tall tales. From realistic post-modern roots, Webb takes his poems into hyperbolic/surrealistic directions. The reader is compelled to go along with the ruse, because his deadpan delivery makes fictional elements plausible; and because, ultimately, at its heart, this tome is relating dedicated life-earned wisdoms."
3,THE impressionist,"I've been watching many docs on impressionists lately. Because Monet was probably the most famous of the group, every other doc refers to him. So this presented things I already knew. But if you like to learn about the most famous and then move to the obscure, you may want to see this first.It turns out his first name was Oscar, not Claude. Like Kahlo, Rembrandt, and many other artists, he had severe financial concerns.If you love impressionism, then you'll feel good seeing so much of his work. The narrator had horrid French pronunciation. That annoying expert with the squeaky, mousy voice is here again. Hopefully she won't grate on your nerves."
5,Heartland- Sooner Or Later,"Sooner or later is a great book! The whole series is! This one is about Storm, Amy's powerful dappled grey show horse. Amy is spreading herself thin by all the work she is doing at Heartland and at shows. Amy is showing Storm and continuing her work at Heartland. Amy is telling her self she can do it all and have it all. But having it all is hard. So sooner or later Amy is going to have to make a decision between Storm, her beloved horse or Heartland her beloved home."
5,Amazing!!!,"I love this book so much!!! Heartland books rock! It's awesome and very cool how they use all those herbs to cure the horses! I would love to do something like that for a job. It's amazing!!! I love her book and recommend them to everyone. Not just 9-12 year olds. I know someone who is 17 and she loves them! Of course, she goes through them really quickly, but she really likes them, and I do too!"
1,A waste of my time,"If you want to read about someone's love affair with boards, this is the book for you. Perhaps I didn't care for it because the author and I have completely opposing views as to machinery vs. hand tools. For me, I try to do as little work with hand tools as possible, leaving that work for a machine built for the purpose to get the job done. I don't have time to spend a day hand-planing when I have 30 cabinets to get out the door. I feel the title was very misleading. I was thinking I would be reading about tricks of the trade from a master. Instead, I'm reading about his cat and how he found lumber buried under a pile of rubble and how he agonized for years what he would build from that."
4,Very good loved it,"it is a great book for all ages As you all know Haru left to find musica to fix the ten power sword, but will he fix it? Haru gets to the mainland and to think it's your first time in a big city and to make maters worseplue gets stolen!!!!!! But lucky haru finds plue at a dog racing track but this is no ordinary dog track. This is a dog track for dogs with special armor and while this is happenningall of the owners of the dogs are looking for haru but he is saved by a cute girl named Elie who lost her memory one year ago. but to you girls out there Elie is prety cool.she saves haru two times from the demon card member.Don't worry haru can beat him with a little help from Elie. and so haru and his new frend Elie. who is going with haru so he can help find Elies memoryso now it is haru ,Elie and plue. that was just a little sneak peek for you. I hope you like it I did. I have read all 18 of the rave masters and I love them all. happy reading. (:"
1,Terrible Reception,"Forget using the antenna for air reception.....its almost useless. Lots of video noise and no sound on weak channels (no fine tuning possible). The only saving factor of this item is its cable connection....works fine. But if you have cable connection available, why hook it up to this small screen player?"
5,A marvelous reference for fantasy postcard collectors...,"Mashburn writes great books, no question about it. This particular postcard guide focuses on fantasy postcards, which are a particular favorite of mine. He coveres all the basics: fairies, nursery rhymes, dressed animals, mermaids, teddy bears, Santas, Krampus, nudes, death fantasies, Halloween, Hold-To-Light, and a whole host of other types of weird and wonderful subjects.As well, Mashburn gives us a comprehensive history of postcards and collecting, covering the seven eras of postcards. He discusses the various types, how to date them, grade them, and value them. Since the book was written in '96, his prices do not always reflect current online auction prices, but that's understandable. My only real quibble with this book is that after reading through it and looking at the many black and white illustrations I only wanted to go out and buy more cards! A wonderful book, don't hesitate."
5,Cat loves it!!,"We don't get much cold weather where I live, but on those chilly nights from the 30's to the 50's, he loves it."
1,False advertising,I looked a the reviews of other purchasers of this product before I ordered. They all got the heated kitty pad...But I got just the cover...period! I ordered a heated kitty Pad with cover. Just like the picture shows. It has the cord and pad pictured. Where is the heated pad I ordered? Is this all I get?
2,don't bother,"If you want to know why a cross section of people in the US knit, this is somewhat interesting. There are no illustrations, just a few line drawings that do nothing to add to the book."
3,good for true massage fans,"this is not the greatest video ever made but I enjoyed it, although Cleo is a little ""red light district"" in her manner...buy it used, probably not worth full price but I enjoyed it."
5,Fell asleep in between my contractions!,"I had a home water birth with my second child and I used this CD to relax during labor. We had it playing all day long and it was so relaxing I found myself falling asleep in between my contractions! We continued to keep it playing even after our daughter was born as we slept that night. She seemed to enjoy it too! The fetal heartbeat sounds are strange at first, but you adjust to it quickly. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Awesome,"This cd is awesome. I bought it for my son and the first night they used it, my grandaughter slept like a rock. She is 2 months old. New parents have had no sleep so were thrilled. I highly recommend this product."
5,Three Guitars,"Great classic guitar recording. If you like classical guitar, this is a solid addition to your collection."
4,Quite rubbery,"For those who want this as a halloween costume item, as I did, be aware that they are quite rubbery. They are not like jell-o, but they are quite a bit softer than hard rubber. The consistency is pretty close to that of a cold hot dog right out of the refrigerator. But they look nice."
2,Starts good goes nowhere and ends poorly.,Great idea and all but the characters and the action are thin real thin. I could not suspend disbelief at all in the last half. Sheer perseverance saw me thru to the end. Not much to reccomend it. In fact I'd like my money back on this one.
4,YES!,"The classic Atari 2600 game, now available on Gameboy! This is an exact conversion (as I recall), with good colors. At last I can beat this game..."
1,Enormity Matched by Enormousness,"Three novella thematically linked. ""Dunyazadiad,"" the best, retells the framework for 1001 Arabian Nights. ""Perseid"" tells what happened after Perseus killed Medusa and married Andromeda. The ""Bellerophoniad"" retells Bellerophon's story, combining it with the ""Dunyazadiad"" and confusing it beyond belief with all manner of mythological and deconstructional and metafictional interruptions. The enormity of this book is matched by the enormousness of its detail. The book is amusing in parts, but in the end is itself a Chimera."
1,out of date,"There have been major advances in psychology, Jung's psychology included, since this book was written. This book is more of the old fashioned style of pulling people into long analysis with an analyst rather than freeing them to learn on their own. The theory in this book that some dreams should not be interpreted because that might interupt a process, is nonsense. The psyche is far stronger in its intent to communicate and will find its way through. The views in this book are very subjective and not up to date."
1,Device broke after about 300 pages :(,"This device worked wonderfully (I was able to create books out of pdf ebooks I own), but then around the 300th page the slider broke off from the internal metal hole punchers. I'm going to go into my garage and get a screwdriver and see if I can fix this. But this is a very flimsy, shoddily-made product. I had a strict rule of never punching more than 5 pages at a time, so I certainly wasn't abusing the product."
3,"Nice Results, But Process Can Be Problematic","I like the look of the ProClick spines, but this machine does have some drawbacks. First, if you don't have strong hands and you're working with index paper which has been laminated (about all I work with), it's really very hard to pull the half-wheel along for cutting even a single page. And if you're working with undersized paper (which is all I work with), it takes a lot of testing time to find the exact spot to place the paper so you don't wind up with half-a-hole at one end. Finally, the cutters aren't accessible, and since I'm working with sticky laminates, I'm guessing I may eventually have a problem with not being able to clean away the stickiness. But if you're working with plain letter size paper, this is a good product."
4,As Described and Advertised,Works great with my PC polisher! Good value for money. I would buy again. Hook and loop makes switching pads easier.
4,"A great book, but. . .","This is a really great book. It was entertaining, moving, and the author writes beautifully. And now I want to learn a lot about anthropology. But there was one thing that didn't ring true. I couldn't understand why Joe Towles wanted to become an anthropologist. I never got it. I just didn't learn enough about HIM. This is a biography of Colin Turnbull but I wanted to know much more about J. Towles. What I did find so moving was the passionate relationship colin turnbull and joe towles had. I love romances, and I love books that entertain me rather than tax my mind. This was a good beach book for me. If you like love stories, this is a wonderful read."
4,very nice quality mat,"Its a very nice mat, but only distinction really is that it is slightly smaller than a standard one."
5,Fact or Fiction?,I really enjoyed this novel.I have read a lot of stuff on the Old West ;both fact[?] and fiction. As for fiction I like Longarm and Trailsman.However part of the fascination is trying to sort out which is which.The author takes a novel approach in trying to do this and produces a very readible and convincing book.The list of books at the end is appreciated;thanks.
4,A great game for the whole family,"Starting in Canada around 1850 Crokinole is a fun and fast game of skill, stratagy and flicking little wooden puks"
2,Too sweet,"I prefer the Walgreens comparable brand which are cheaper. These are sickening sweet. For most people, sweet is not an issue, and they are more palatable than pills."
4,Not bad,"They actually taste pretty good. However, there is an after taste that I have noticed, so I try to eat them before a meal so that I don't have to deal with it. Much easier than trying to swallow a giant pill multiple times a day."
2,Not David's best...,"A cluster of world music cliches'; a disappointing outing from the ususally reliable Arkenstone. The album feaures none of the grand, sweeping orchestrations or pop nuances that marked his best efforts; instead, we are given song after song of bland, meandering sameness, more in keeping with meditiation/contemplation music than anything else. Fans of that kind of music may find this interesting; it would probably be good as ambient background or relaxation help. Only the last track, ""Into the dreamtime,"" features anything resembling what fans have come to expect from David--and the best part of the song comes in the last two minutes! I was very, very disappointed with this album; but David redeemed himself with his next effort, ""Caravan of Light."""
4,Wonderful,"This was the first CD by David Arkenstone I bought and it's wonderful. Very light and relaxing, I really enjoyed the entire CD."
5,Lost Poem,"This is a poem written by my grandfather, Ilo Orleans. I haven't seen a copy in years.I was happily surprised to find it, and it was in mint condition. I would purchase any other copiesif they became available."
5,"Great movie, loved it.","I watched this movie today. It looked liked it had all the elements of a Pinocchio story and Cinderella combined. The story starts out with this red headed boy who says to the couple he was boarding at. ""I was a rat."" They eventually named him Roger. He was wearing a royal page boy uniform. The movie showed how the couple was training him out of his rat-like ways so he could adjust to life as a human being. There was a scene in the movie where the rat was changed into a boy a long with a young lady who had a dress costume magically created. I think any parent would be happy to have their kids watch this movie. I intend to view my copy many times."
1,No thanks!,"Sent this Bible back to Amazon ASAP--- gives you a headache trying to decipher all the additions to the text. Stick with a ""standard"" KJV Study Bible-- you will be much happier!"
4,Small type a problem for some.,"There is no doubt that the Rotherham's Emphasized Bible is a great teaching tool. Basically I like it, but I found the small type a real challenge, and my vision is good. Anyone with impaired vision will certainly have a problem with it.The other consideration is its weight. Over 4 lbs. That might be a problem for some. Also, the Sacred Name groups will appreciate the name Yahweh, especially the Yahwehans, and even the Yahvehans. But alas, the name Jesus is used in the New Testament instead of Yahshua or Yehshua.If the above doesn't present a problem then I heartily recommend this Bible. There may be other encumbrances yet to emerge, but as of now I'm enjoying it in spite of the ""problems."""
4,Great puzzle game,"This game is modeled after the classic still-interface games from the 80's in which you use one word commands to interact with the environment (look, use, take, open, close, talk, hit, and leave) The game takes place in Chicago/ Las Vegas in the 30's and is very nostalgic and fun at the same time. You basically pick up items and try to piece together clues in order to figure out what happened. It is quite challenging. If you have never played it before and you enjoy these style games, you should definately buy it. Another similar game by the same company which takes place in Midevil times is Shadowgate. If you like Deja Vu you will like Shadowgate, and vice versa."
2,One of the worst Gameboy games I have ever bought,"The graphics are fine, and for what it is, the game is fine. The problem is that the game isn't much fun. Basically, the game consists of you looking through drawers, pockets, etc to try to get things to help you. The problem is that you never know what you are going to need. You end up with sausages and plates in your pockets, and the game is so arbitrary that there is no sense of real game flow. If you love these types of games, you probably won't be disappointed, but Shadowgate (made by the same people) was much better than this game."
5,it really is everything dog!,"In this book, it has so many different facts about dogs, i don't even know where to start.Marty Crisp talks about why dogs like people, how long their memory span is, and what dogs have cold wet noses for, including many other things. i am a big fan of this book. I know a lot about dogs, and their one of my fave animals, but i still learned quite a few good facts about them.I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes dogs, and also ckeck out Everything Cat and Everything Dolphin too!"
5,Grief book,"I do believe my loved one (Dad) lives on within me in that I am the person I am today because of the love and guidance he gave me. I miss him.This book certainly had some ideas I wasn't familiar with such as shamanic journeying.I am in the grieving process and have bought quite a few books.I am currently using the grief workbook, Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal and I bought After the Tears, A Gentle Guide to Help Children Understand Death (video) for the children in our family.My heart goes out to anyone who is grieving. May God bless you all."
5,greate cutter,"Definitely the best cutter I have so far. It is well worth the price. Sturdy wooden base, sharp blade. I will buy it again."
3,This box of ProClick Spine refills is not good.,"This is my second box of ProClick Spine refills. I could not get the Zip Tool to work so I had to close all the rings by hand. I found this to be the case with the eight spines I tried. I love the ProClick machine, but they must have done something different to the refill spines. The Zip Tool worked perfectly on all the spines in the first box I purchased a few years ago."
3,Ummm..,It's good but really easy to beat. If your into racing then it is a good game. It was my first game for gbc and i think i beat it within a day...
2,Lame,"The writing in this comes across as that of a disaffected 16 year old. Ellis creates strawmen and then has Spider knock them all down... If you're above the age of emancipation (mentally at least) this book will not interest you whatsoever. I found a few human moments in book two but otherwise the Transmetropolitan series is a yawner. As for the art, it is okay but nowhere near the level of some other truly superlative books, and nothing to get excited about."
1,I Love Ellis but not this.,"If you spend your time hanging in front of Hot Topic in your Che' t-shirt complaining about how ""the man"" is oppressing you or are going though a faze where you think Hunter Thompson is the coolest man that ever lived than you will enjoy Transmetropolitan. If you are over 16 or aren't a teenager perpetually mad at your mom and dad then you might want to try something else written by Ellis like Planetary. I tend to enjoy anything Ellis writes but just found Transmetropolitan annoying and sophomoric."
2,Just doesn't make it....,"I don't know why I buy these ""Dummy"" books. If you're a semi-literate computer user, it's not going to help much. If you're a neophite, then Goldmine probably isn't the program you should be using for contact management. Goldmine is powerful but complicated. To use it, a relationship with a consultant who knows the program inside an out is the way to go.I miss the old 3 inch thick ""Que"" books and wish there was a manual of that nature available for GM. This one only scratches the surface and that will leave you hanging. If you have an inclination to buy this book, look at ACT! or MS Outlook instead of Goldmine, or hire a Goldmine Certified Consultant."
2,It works but without this it is better,It works but beware I after having sex your libido will be dropped to none for 2-3 days. I would say my sex was much better before this product.
4,"Works, but not as you'd expect","If you're considering this product i'm sure you know what it is used for. I bought this and found that it did improve my sex life, mainly because it gets you in the mood."
2,I had great expectations... and these didn't meet them,"I'd heard great things about Horny Goat Weed and have always heard that Swanson was one of the better brands. I bought 4 bottles when they were on sale and stuck with them for about a month, taking them according to the directions on the package. I had some extra energy for the first week or two, but I can't say I noticed much of anything after that even after I took some time off and started up again.To give some perspective, I keep in decent shape and work out 2-3 times a week, maintain an average body weight with lower than average body fat, have decent cholesterol and excellent cardio stats, and eat well. I'm not sure if that has any impact on their supposed effectiveness and perhaps they work better for others, but they didn't do much for me."
1,Weak,Very weak product spend a few extra dollars to buy a product that works you get what you paid for.
2,Tragically flawed,"What's your data worth? If it's not much you probably don't need to carry it with you. If it's actually valuable, then this drive is not for you.I loved this drive for the first couple of months. Then the problems surfaced. The housing and keyring attachment on this drive are so flimsy you'll get maybe 3 months use before it falls apart. If you're lucky you'll notice as soon as it happens. If not, you'll just notice that the drive has fallen out of the housing somewhere, or else the housing has separated from your keychain.I'd recommend getting something more solid."
4,"Child size, but not child weight","These are child sized, but they are heavy for a youngster. Make sure that the weight is appropriate for your child."
2,Not Adoff's Best,"Arnold Adoff has written marvelous books of poetry. This isn't one of them. Many of the poems seem to have been written by children. Perhaps that was the intention. Perhaps a sports fan or athlete would be able to connect to the text better than I did. There are some excellent images such as a soccer player who is ""a brown tornado on a muddy day"" and a dry throat waiting for a cold can of pop. Could be a nice tool for getting young athletes to reflect on their activities through poetry and other types of writing."
3,A sob story for a voiceless disorder,"The author is trying to sell you a self help manual that reads like a sob story of broken dreams. Thank God it's very short, or else you wouldn't be able to take the tedium. Although on the other had you do sort of feel his pain. When you decipher the exteraneous stuff he does offer some good advice. But it's not a quick fix or very enlightening."
3,If only I could get a copy from you!,"I would love to review this disc, but I have one problem. I've ordered this twice from you and recived a differant title each time. Your web site shows the title as being available, and no mention of limited availibility is suggested. So what can I say??"
1,Teaching English Across Cultures....,Apparently this book was revolutionary in the 1970s but is now considered dated. I'm told the Lado language school has EXTENSIVELY revised and improved on it's methods since this book was first published. Really it's only of use if you have a keen interest in the history of English language teaching....
3,"Good speakers, terriable stand","I just recieved this product today, and it has both pros and cons. The speaker volume and quality aren't shockingly amazing, but for the price ($14) the speakers are a good value. The main probably i have with the psp amp is how terriable it is designed as a stand for psp. You can't see it from the photos, but this comes in 3 pieces: cords (audio from psp to the amp, and power cord for the amp), speakers, and the stand that attaches to the speakers. The stand is VERY loose in connecting to the speakers. Im afraid of dropping my psp if i don't pick this thing up with both hands.All in all, its a good speaker system if you are shopping on a budget. If you don't care about price, or perhaps this is going to be used by a younger person with bad motor skills- you should probably look elsewhere."
3,"Good Sound, Terrible Set-Up","My 2 Cents:Not sure why no one here said anything about the terrible setup - that when you hook up the included audio chord to attach the PSP-2000/3000 to the speakers, the chord would not allow the PSP to fit into included cradle, so you end up not being able to use it together!Then what's the point of the whole set-up??It's intended to be a mini-theatre set-up for you to attach your PSP and watch movies, yet it fails miserably!The only thing you can do is use it just to listen to music - then you would just hook it up and let your PSP lie flat on a table top, etc. - so basically useless for watching movies.One work-around would be to buy a separate stand that would allow for a audio-out hookup, then just place your PSP+stand in front of the speakers, but that's more money involved and is just ridiculous how the designers couldn't figure this out.On the plus side, the sound from the speakers is excellent considering the $15 price."
2,Got these for $30 1 yr ago,I bought these speakers in a store a year or two ago for $30. They're great speakers but for this price I'm looking elsewhere.
4,PLAY GEAR AMP,I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY BF THAT IS SHIPPING OVER SEAS....ITS A GREAT ITEM FOR THEM TO JUST HAVE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC OR MOVIES WHILE IN THEIR TENTS.....I THINK ITS GREAT FOR TRAVEL........
2,Logitech PSP speakers,"These speakers were great- while they lasted. Four about 4 weeks I had great quality sound from these speakers. After that every time I hit the power switch it would make a horrible, loud buzzing sound, even if there was nothing hooked up to it and on battery power. I called Logitec support which had me hold for 20 without even talking to anyone. I emailed them and received preformulated responses that didn't even describe how to fix my problem. Logitec makes great products and I have many, but doesn't support them very well."
3,"Well written, interesting, but not his best.","I read Laughable Loves after breezing through, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, in a weekend. Laughable Loves, was well written and interesting, but it didn't hold my attention like The Unbearable Lightness of Being did. Laughable Loves, is a collection of short stories that explore love and relationships from the male perspective. While Kundera's thoughts and philosophies are interesting there isn't as much substances here as in his other works. The book was very readable and perhaps would be excellent for a commuter or someone with not a lot of time to read. The short stories for the most part were interesting enough, but they didn't engage you as much as his other works have. Towards the end I found myself, just reading this to get through rather than for enjoyment. Over all it was well written and interseting enough, I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his other works."
4,A reflective book of poetry,"I hate poetry, but I love Buk's poems. This book is written in a more hesitant thought out manner. It seems as if Buk got sentimental for a period and the result is a book of poetry that seems mostly retrospective. These poems seem less emotional and more calm. Yet at times his poems recount hilarious antecdotes and reveal his retrospective insights concerning them. In one poem, Bukowski comments on people complaining that his recent poem's lack of urgency. I got the mental image of Bukowski aging alone and wondering why he isn't dead yet. This is a book of non-urgent slow moving beautiful poems. To put it in simplist terms, I recomend it."
3,"Recipes are a little fancy/time consuming, but good info overall","I recently purchased a Cuisinart 4 in 1 griddle/grill machine for our apartment, and was looking for a cookbook that would have specific timing/temperature instructions for an indoor grill, as well as some recipes tailored to indoor grill use. While I found the recipes a little too overdone/complicated for our liking, the book did provide some good tips for cooking meat and other types of food on an indoor grill. I liked that it has instructions for a lot of different types of indoor grills, because not all are made equal! In the end, this is a good reference book to have on hand, but we won't be reaching to it for new recipes to try that often."
1,Poorly written book,"This book has no real value-add as a book to keep in one's library. Its filled with content any mid-level engineer already knows or can figure out on their own. It goes into no low-level detail of the switch hardware or software design in anyway. The topic on SAN Design was written semi-technical in a sense the *ONLY* design considerations are ""two tier"", ""three tier"", ""star"" ... sounds like old network design concepts from a 1991 Cisco press book on LAN Switches.Go to the book store and just flip through this book, if you're familiar with networking and storage already, this book is of no use, if you're someone with absolutely zero knowledge of SANs and Brocade, get this book at a ""dummies"" book and don't rely on it to pass interviews per se."
4,Belarus Secret,"Amazing book. Everything what I read 25 years ago in the Soviet Union papers about former Nazis working on Radio Liberty, Radio Freedom etc.,turned out to be true... One cannot suspect J.Loftus in pro-Soviet feelings - he just writes about what he found."
1,One of the most pathetic games for GBC,"I can't believe people are reviewing this game favorably here! Are standards THAT low?First there is the control problem. Um, ok, I love having the ability to get the player I'm controlling stuck to the point were I have to quit the game because there is no way to maneuver. Also, is was PAINFUL to try and even get into the cars.Second, the game is just BORING. Nothing like the PC game which was a lot of fun. No, I wasn't expecting the PC version, but the gameplay is plain horrible.Save your money, don't buy this game."
2,Grand Theft Auto,"This game is not worth your time. Although the city in the gameboy version is the same huge city in the PC verison, the game falls way short of Grand Theft Auto's good name. The graphics are decent and no compliants from that part of the game, but the overall game play is lacking. It is quite common for you to walk down a mainstreet and not see a car for miles. The police rarely come after you. I've had four cop heads one me(means I was a bad bad boy) and been able to walk around town without a cop ever coming after me. The steering system in cars is very poor and hard to turn. When you turn your car it looks cheesy and very unrealistic. I would not recommend you buy this game."
2,Poor control really hurts this game,"Grand Theft has a refreshing plot-twist going for it (if nothing else) b/c in this game you are the criminal working your way up the outlaw ladder.Too bad about the play control. This could have been a solid game if you could make your character go the way you wanted him to. Instead, you are confined to awkward and tedious control functions that render Grand Theft Auto virtually UNPLAYABLE."
1,This was a crushing disappointment,"I read The Conqueror as a random book I found in the library many years ago and loved it. The character development and plot were wonderful and the romance scenes were also phenomenal.This book...not only did it change the entire persona of the characters developed in the previous book, some parts were just absolutely ridiculous, even for a romance novel. This was a pale echo of The Conqueror without the excellent writing and plot.This book didn't make it on my bookshelf and will most likely be donated to my local library's book sale. It's not worth reading twice."
3,Stops at Perl 5.8,"I naively assumed that the second edition would include Perl 5.10, as they came out the same year. But this is not the case and the changes in regex support between 5.8 and 5.10 were significant enough that this is a big hit for this book. It's now 4 years old and while I can't speak for other languages, I'll be surprised if .NET regex support hasn't also evolved in that time."
4,All that and a bag of chips,"I found this guide very useful. I learned a whole slew of new expressions to incorporate into my everyday vocabulary. To think, I'd been wasting my time saying things like, ""Wicked cool!"".Stubblebine gives it to you in an easy-to-understand format. If he had other books I'd buy them (plus, I understand from some women in the geek community that he's a total babe!). Two thumbs up!"
3,Too Many Implementations?,"Based on the .NET chapter it would appear that the author tackled too many implementations. It looked like all of the .NET stuff came from the SDK, sans discussion & examples.Developers worrying about an expression to be executed on several different platforms might find this type of overview helpful. How many folks do that though?"
3,Calcium Pyruvate,Does it work? I cannot truly say. It may be that I have not taken it long enough to see the effects. Not sure if I will spend the money again though...
2,A disappointing read,"I guess my expectations were higher than most because there is no way I would give this book five stars. In my opinion, the dialogue seemed weak and unrealistic in a lot of areas, the quips fell flat, and the main character, Nick, was uninteresting. Also, as a resident of Brockport, I found the changes to locale disconcerting, and even annoying at times. While I do understand that changes are sometimes necessary, for the most part, these seem to make no sense. Perhaps another town in Monroe County would have been a better choice for this particular novel.Mr. Tomasso writes in a simplistic manner, without a real feel for chacterization or emotion (the relationship between Nick and Karis was not believable as written), and quite frankly, I'm a bit perplexed at the rave reviews I've read. If you're looking for an intense thriller that makes you think, I wouldn't recommend choosing Tenth House."
1,Doesn't Work!,"This does not work on tile surfaces; there is no grip on the bottom.Haven't tried using it on any other surface, but I would imagine it will work on carpet."
1,This game is horrible don't buy it.,"Well one day I was on the internet and I found this game. I read the reviews, it didn't do very good. But I wanted to buy it and my mom wouldn't let me because she thought it didn't sound like it did very good. Then, she gave in. So I ordered the game I waited like a week and a half. I finally got it. It SUCKED!!!!!!!!. And now I can't return it and get my money back so that sucked too. Plus it didn't have intructions or it's original packaging. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!."
4,Great but red and orange difficult to tell apart,"My daughter loves playing with these bears and the pattern cards I ordered. The only problem is that the orange and the red bears are so close in color it is hard for her to distinguish. Ordinarily, she does know the difference between red and orange. She finds it frustrating when she has to keep asking me if the bear is supposed to be red or orange. But still, it has got her more interested in counting and trying to learn the concept of patterns."
3,Flinsy at best.,"I haven't used this yet but it looks pretty flimsy, time will tell. Thank goodness it'll only be used to hold a lightweight poster."
5,LOVE IT!,These things seriously rock!! Grab them by the top corner and watch it unfold before you and in about 10 seconds you have a full size easel ready to use. And in a matter of 10 seconds you can tear it down and you're ready to go home. Definitely plan on getting more of these.
1,What the 'ell is it?,Some kind of combination CD/business card? Can it be played in a CD/DVD-ROM drive?
1,Not Nearly As Good As I'd Hoped,"Ms Nevins starts out with an interesting idea, but her Greek mythology is flawed. I would expect more from a scholar. After finding her errors in mythology, I kept reading to see if the mistakes could be overlooked for the quality of the writing. Instead, I find that she makes Pagans looks like blood-crazed madmen and -women. I grant you, this is a work of fiction, and so portrayals of characters in the book should not be taken as the way modern Pagans really are, but there are an awful lot of folks who think Harry Potter is teaching children witchcraft...At best, this is mediocre fiction. The main character is not terribly likeable, and that makes it hard to care what happens. At worst, this book paints an ugly picture of Pagans, which should not be believed under any circumstances."
3,Back on track (no pun intended!),"This non-fiction series of TCs is back on track. ""SUBMARINE"" was a good read with the right combination of technical detail and non-technical descriptions. ""ARMORED CAV"" was not as sure, and ""FIGHTER WING"" was darned boring. Because these are what you could call semi-reference books an element of entertainment is needed. SUB had that and now ""MARINE"" puts the series back on track. Loaded with information, observation and speculation this volume hits the formulae squre on the nose. Pay attention to what makes 'em work, Tom and keep 'em coming"
1,Bossa Cubana,"I ordered this CD by recommendation and am keenly disappointed. In my opinion, it is over-produced and over-glitzed, a kind of Euro-disco production. It lacks the freshness and vitality of Cuban music (the kind I hoped it would be), e.g., Omara, the Buena Vista Social Club. There was rock and roll, doo-wop, some production numbers"" such as ""a Day in the Life of a Fool,"" some straight-out-of-the-fifties music, and very few bossa novas. I suggest that anyone wishing to order the CD should preview it very carefully."
2,not happy in the end,"at first this was a good little light vac..just what I needed for area rugs and tile, but after having it about 4 months it quit. started to overheat then just stopped."
1,stopped working after using 3 times,"i saw some bad reviews when i bought it, but i also saw so many good one so i decided to buy, the problem was after using it 3 times it didn't really work anymore, it doesnt clean anything, just terrible. dont buy it, really."
3,Good while it lasted,"We purchased this product, January 2005 based on the glowing reviews on Amazon. It worked well for about 18 months, but then power brush stopped spinning and there is now no suction whatsoever. We expected a longer life span for this product."
4,Pretty Impressed,"We needed somthing that would do a quick clean, we have a really nice Dyson vaccum,its just a pain to drag that out all the time. Granted we have only used it a few times since Christmas, but its Great, I can go from the carpet to hardwood floors with just a push of the button. My only concern is the button on the waste cannister,is not very sturdy, my one year old found this out for me, but other than that, I would highly suggest this little cleaning machine."
2,good for limited time,"I purchased it in Jan 2010. Perfect for the first a few times of usage. After 3-4 months, every time I started using it, it was getting so hot and stopped after 5 minutes working. I had to let it rest for 15 minutes and then start again. Recently the brush stoped working and I showed it to a retailer and he said the head should be replaced and it costs more than the vaccum cleaner. So I just have to throw it away. You get what you pay for."
4,Hoover Flair Vacuum,"We bought this vacuum about 2 1/2 years ago and absolutely loved it. We had a cat and were vacuuming often to keep up with the cat hair and dust. We have hardwood floors and this vacuum was great for these floors. The only problem is that the battery has lost it's power. It doesn't have a strong charge anymore and we looked into getting a battery and found out that it can't be replaced. But for that price and getting over 2 years of use from it, it is still a great buy!"
1,Don't be a sucker like me,"Please don't buy this product. It is nice and works well until it breaks. I bought three of them - I bought 2 last April (one for me and one for my mother who is 82). I used mine on hardwood floors to swivel around and pick up dust and pet hair. I was nice until the plastic part at the bottom cracked completely off - I tried glue and tape but it didn't work. I liked the vacuum so I bought another one last November - well, it broke in the same place in less than 2 months. I called Hoover to let them know that there was some kind of design flaw problem - they offered to send me a replacement which I thought was nice of them. I called them today to see if the replacement had been sent yet and they said that a replacement nozzle was on the way. I explained to them that the nozzle (floor part) was not broken - it was the plastic casing itself on the stick that attached to the nozzle. I couldn't make them understand. Just don't buy this product because it breaks."
3,"Cheap Vacuum, works for minor cleaning job...watch out for cheap parts","For the price, the vacuum worked okay for tile floors and short rugs, but seemed to struggle on thicker rugs. After about 20 minutes of vacuuming, it would get hot, though it never turned off on me as some reviewers stated. It doesn't stand well on its own since it is top heavy so that was always a negative. Cleaning out the bag is a chore since the vac sucks the debris into the motor component so the ""bag"" is inverted and you have to use your hand to clean it out. Then today after only 3 months of having the vacuum, the head brush connected to the bag on the bottom cracked. I hope the warranty will be respected...but what a hassle!"
2,Powerful for its size. Overheat easily.,"I was looking for a convenient vacuum to clean bare wood floor of a 2 story house plus a few rugs. It did a good job on both bare wood and rug. But it overheat easily, usually before I can finish the 1200 square feet first floor. It will recover and reset itself after cooling down which takes hours. It may be ideal for apartment dwellers, but not so good for house owner. After a year, I gave it to my young daughter who lives in an apartment. I am looking for another light weight stick vacuum for bare floor that would not overheat."
2,It broke after a couple of months,It broke at the coupling between vacuum and the beater head.It worked ok before that - nice and light - but i had to clean out the filter about every 20 min with a shop vac because it plugged with dust and caused the motor to overheat.I want one with a bag and a little better built.
1,Piece of Junk!,do not purchase!!! Broke after 1 month of use!!! The button for bare floors will not work and they want me to take it to a service center 45 minutes away to have it fixed. DO NOT BUY!!!
3,Good for limited purposes,"I have purchased two of these vacuums. Both work very well on bare floors and area rugs. But they will overheat and cut out temporarily if using the power nozzle in dwellings with wall to wall carpet. I have called the company to report the problem and was advised that they are not meant to clean entire houses or apartments, or even entire rooms of any size with wall to wall carpeting. The company says they are meant for ""touch-up"" cleaning in small areas. Nevertheless, as I said, they have worked well cleaning an entire small house with bare floors (and not using the power nozzle). It ia using the nozzle for extended periods of time that apparently causes the overheating."
2,"It sucked!! Then, it didn't....","For a vacuum, sucking is a good thing. Initially, I thought this vacuum to be all that Consumer Reports and amazon reviews said about it. For the price, this vacuum seemed well built, performed well, and was essentially the perfect vacuum for small spaces. However, up until the fourth or fifth use the vacuum motor quit working (The carpet brush still works.). I noticed the motor was running real whinny, but could not find anything obstructing its suction path. If it had one, it's like its ""governor"" broke and the motor burnt out. It's dead. May just have been a lemon. The area cleaned with the vacuum consists of one area rug and hard floors elsewhere in 600 sq. ft."
1,Motor Overheats,"The first 3 months with the vacuum were great!.....then...it started overheating and the motor would simply turn off. I assumed it was time for a new filter, but after a new filter replacement, the issue continued. Then i noticed on the side of the vacuum: ""NOTICE: This cleaner has a device which will turn the motor off if overheating occurs. Turn switch off and unplug. Check for clogs or dirty filter. Allow to cool for 30 minutes."" I can now only use my vacuum for 7 minute intervals before the motor shuts off. My advice: Buyer beware."
5,BEST Stick Vac,I am on my second Flair (the first fell and the dust bin broke) and I love this stick vac. After the first one broke I bought and tried at least three others because I couldn't find the Flair in a store. Needless to say the others went back and I went on the internet to find me another Flair. I love the powered roller brush. It is the ONLY stick vac that I have tried or owned that DOES NOT scatter pieces of debris everywhere. For that reason alone (but there are so many other pluses too) I am forever loyal to the Flair.
4,"Light weight, easy to store, convenient to use","We've had our new hardwood floors and area rugs for almost two months and this was our choice for cleaning. It's been excellent so far. I love the pivoting power head that switches easily from bare floor to carpet mode. I'm not a big ""bagless"" fan, but this is the best option for a vacuum this size. It's simple to use. When my 83 year old grandma saw it, she tried it and bought one on the spot. Love the color just as an aside."
5,don't let its small size fool you,i wasn't expecting such a fierce vacuum in this bagless stick Hoover - but its fantastic. worth three times what i paid for it and its bagless feature makes dumping it quick and easy. i highly recommend it. i use it for wood floors and large area rugs around the apartment.
5,This thing is great!,"I love it. It's perfect for our house, which is all laminate floors with a few throw rugs. The filter is sufficient to do the whole house without having to empty and clean it, and to those who complained about how loud it is, I don't know what you're looking for, but it's obviously not a vacuum with this much power. Indeed, for this much suction, this unit is actually very quiet. It rolls very smoothly on it's rubberized wheels, which do not marr the floor, and the head is very maneuverable. The ""beater bar"" can be engaged or disengaged to make cleaning the throw rugs as quick and easy as cleaning the laminate floor."
2,Died quickly,"I bought this vacuum for my small apartment with all wood floors. At first the product worked well: it cleaned maybe 85% of the dust and dirt off the floors and spread the rest around, but it was good enough for $50.Soon, the suction stopped being as effective, the brush meant to clean carpets was riddled with hair that I could not remove, and the filter - which I emptied every time I cleaned - had some metal piece that broke off. It still worked to some degree though.After eleven months of use, the vacuum died. It no longer turns on, and therefore doesn't work! Yes, a $50 vacuum is a great deal, but I'd rather have purchased a more expensive product that would have lasted a few years (maybe even close to ten...) instead of dying so quickly.I don't recommend this product, not only because of its untimely death, but also because while alive it didn't do its job very well."
1,Vacuums are supposed to suck??? right?,"This vacuum overheats while vacuuming my 5x8 rug and needs to sit for about 5 minutes before I can finish vacuuming the rest of the house, floors only. I do not recommend this vacuum at all! I literally used it two times before it started to overheat. Although it is compact to put away in a closet and easy to pull out in a pinch, it is not worth it. I usually end up spoon feeding the things I want it to vacuum up right in front of it. THIS VACUUM SUCKS!"
2,Short life and plan for low use,"Good power with tendency to overheat and auto shut down. The support to stand on its own is not good, and most likely will fall often. In our experience, the life of this product is less than one year with overheating becoming a frequent problem - so plan to clean when this device is working. We use this only for small areas of cleaning and almost all over tiles and small rugs."
4,Good kitchen electric broom,"I bought this as a kitchen/hard wood floor vacuum in hopes it would do a better job of keeping the dog hair dust bunnies under control. My traditional broom/dustpan would send them flying through the air to relocate elsewhere. So far, it does a good job on kitchen floor crumbs and an adequate job with the dog hair. If too much is sucked up (when I haven't vacuumed for a day, well, many days actually), the dog hair tends to clog the roller so I have to stop and pull out the clog. As with any bagless vacuum, I live with getting a bit dirty emptying the canister and filter in exchange for not having to purchase/replace bags. The canister/filter is relatively easy to empty and reinstall. The unit does get hot if run for a while. The cord isn't as long as I'd like. Biggest complaint: the unit is not self standing. I'm careful to set it down on the floor rather than lean it against a wall or furniture, as it will slid and fall."
4,Bare floors? Get this!,"Because we have an old house, we have old oak floors. Sweeping with a broom never did enough to get everything up and spread the dust all over everything. This little vac is great! Really does a job on the wood floors! I only have 3 rugs and The Flair is good enough for them. Also like the clear dust ""bag"" so that you know when it is getting full and, therefore, less efficient. Worth every penny!"
4,Great stick vac!,"I vacuum my town house every two days and this vac does everything I need it to do. I vacuum all of the downstairs (approx. 1200 sq.ft) tile with several area rugs, the upstairs bathrooms and area rugs, and my carpeted stairs and this vac performs excellently throughout. It doesn't overheat, is very maneuverable, quiet, and very light in weight. The ability to turn the power nozzle on and off so easily is a great feature for switching from rug to tile and back without having to stop. The cord a good length and is easy to roll up and take off the vacuum. Keep in mind that this vacuum is not designed to clean entirely carpeted rooms. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I would like to have all of the filters be washable. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone who has lots of hard floors with rugs to clean."
4,Great lightweight vacuum,I was looking for a vacuum that is lightweight and cleans hard floors as well as carpets. I was not disappointed!
2,Is it powerful? Definitely. Will it break? Probably.,"We loved our Flair. We were willing to tolerate the loud noise it made (like a jet on takeoff) because we felt there was some correlation to suction, and truth be told, this vacuum really did a great job at cleaning up the kitchen (hardwood), especially along edges and in corners. It never seemed quite perfectly designed, as it cannot stand on its own, and must be propped up in a corner or else laid down on the ground. And the dirt cup is not what you might call large. Still, it got the job done, and looked pretty good doing it.But after just over a year of ownership and regular if not often use (3 or 4 times per week and never on carpet), the nozzle broke off at the neck. I tried Super Glue and duct tape but that only lasted a day or two. I have asked Hoover for goodwill on the warranty given the high incidence of failure on this specific part, and I will post any update here. In the meantime, I am back to a broom and dustpan."
4,It Works,It works as advertised. Well built. Easy to clean. Slightly disappointed with pickup. I would buy it again.
5,Very pleased,"This is a great little vacuum for spot cleaning and for vacuuming throw rugs. I am very pleased with the suction power, the ease of use, even the looks of this little vacuum and would definitely buy it again if needed."
3,"ok suction,poor swivel head",I bought this vac 2 years ago.worked OK for 1 year.suction is reasonable.I have only hardwood and it doesn't scratch the floors.The swivel head is made of hard plastic and not too manuverable.swivel head broke after an year.I tried taking pieces apart to see if I could replace it.But not worth the time and effort I had to put in to try to remove the broken piece.still looking for a lightweight one with reasonable suction.
2,love amazon,I love hoover vacuum owning the windtunnel that i got from amazon - best price free shipping! so i ordered the hoover flair bagless- read the review and got the best price at amazon and again free shipping and i could not believe it arrived the day after i ordered it!!.. the vacuum was easy to put together and it really worked well for me for a while it had great suction and i was thrilled to find out that the head swilved!! i ordered it to clean up my den and clean up after my 2 cats lots of hair and litter! after a week it overheated and would not go on and then when it did it stopped picking up the dirt. so i contacted amazon and they are so great they send me out another one that day at no charge!! however i refused the shippment sent back the bad one and ordered a different product all together. so i was sad the flair did not work out for me but i have to say that amazon is amazing i give the vacuum 2 stars but i give amazon 10!
4,Great product!,This is my second Hoover Flair. It has great pickup for its size. Excellent for quick cleaning after cooking and eating everyday. My 7 and 9 year old help out and find it easy to use!
3,Pronto Electrolux,"For me, the Pronto has solved the quick pick up of dog hair off of hardwood/linoleum surfaces. (We have six live-in dogsl) I am very thankful I don't have to drag out the canister vacuum every time I see a fluff of dog hair float by.I removed the beater bar because when I vacuumed strip rugs dog hair kept stopping it up. Even with the beater bar, efficiently vacuuming strip rugs was unsuccessful. With the beater bar removed, the Pronto picks up rampant dog hair.It's been great for hardwood stairs. The charge lasts long enough for me to clean a relatively large area. The lift-off hand vacuum is very handy for places the stick cannot reach. It cleans close to baseboards."
5,Love it! Well designed!,"I think I am more satisfied with this purchase than with about any other amazon purchase I have made. And I have made a lot.Why? Because it works! The ""powered nozzle""! Unlike with Canister Vacuums, this device not only sucks air but the motor also drives a belt which spins a rod in the floor nozzle with brushes on it arranged in a barber shop type pattern. This churns up the dust so it can be sucked up. If fact it is so efficient you have to constantly inspect the filter because it fills up so fast. I think this is why some customers have had trouble with it overheating and shutting off. Expect the filter to fill about every 10' by 10' rug area. Also make sure you press the switch down all the way to the II rug position."
1,So so suction & short life,"I bought this vacuum at the end of November 2007 and got it by December, well now it's February of 2009 and the vacuum died at the end of January. My apartment isn't that big and I'm not a messy person so I would have thought my once a week vacuuming wouldn't be a problem. However it only did so so on the pick up and at times I would have to go over an area more then 5 times to get everything up even though it wasn't much. Also because it took so long it would overheat and shut off so that I had to wait a while for it to cool down to finish. I emptied it after every use and cleaned the bottom out once a month but last month it died so that nothing picks up, the bottom doesn't spin and you get the noise of the vacuum without the use of it. I would recommend looking at another product because after 14 months I need to get a new vacuum."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This vacuum work great on cat hair and light weight dirt. Unfortunately the is product is not powerful enough to lift anything much larger than sand. For the money I think you will be satisfied, but do not purchase if want to use this product to clean up random pieces of cat litter around the house."
4,Excellent vacuum,"This vacuum is lightweight, has excellent suction, and cleans carpeted and tile surfaces well. For the price, it is an excellent value."
2,Broke after a year,"Initial review... I previously had a cordless stick vacuum. It was terrible. Always out of charge when I needed it desperately, and never enough life to do a job of any size. This HOOVER stick is vastly better. OK, so you have to deal with a cord. Big deal. You get tremendous power, unlimited duration, and a slim, light, body that goes anywhere. I can't really think of anything better for an apartment, especially with wood floors.Update... 3/7/12... The internal motor mount cracked, and the vacuum is now defunct. Basically, it gave me a year of service. That is not adequate in my opinion. I will choose another brand next time."
2,Good for about a year,"This is a vacuum that is perfect for my small place, but after a year of use this vacuum is overheating and shutting down. I have to wait an hour or so for it to cool off to be able to use it again. I did read some reviews before I bought this item on how this was a problem but I didn't worry since my place is small and didn't have any carpet. Bummer...Now I have to find a replacement"
5,Love It!,"This vac is exactly what I have been looking for! I have wood and tile floors with 2 shedding dogs. I was tired of sweeping my house with a broom so I wanted something easier. This works great! It gets along the edges of the walls, is a small enough head to fit under my chair legs, and the way the vac lays down allows me to get under my couch and beds. It is very powerful and not too loud. It could use a longer cord, but other than that I love it!"
4,better than I thought it would be,"I am quite happy 2 months in. The suction is very good (haven't found anything it would not pick up yet) and it actually works better than I expected. It does get a little warm so I tend to turn it off just for a few minutes after I finish each room. As a result, I have not had any of the ""cutting off"" problems that other have had. I wanted something for quick pickup of cat hair and dust on hardwood and carpet. This cute little vacuum does that and much more. I now also use it for the steps since it is so much lighter than my upright Windtunnel.Negatives: It will fall over if you do not push forward to make sure the little clips are engaged. Emptying the dust cup is not pleasant (thankfully it is ""my dirt"". Oops, my germaphobia is showing.)"
1,AMAZING little thing!,"I just moved away from home for college and the vacuum that came with the house not only broke but was also waaayy too big for our little apartment. I was looking for something small AND effective and I found it!! This little thing is amazing! I vacuumed the kitchen floor then the living room carpet and I can't BELIEVE how much dust it managed to pick up!! It's small, surprisingly powerful and JUST what I needed... definitely recommended for anyone!Edit: I have now graduated college and purchased two of these over the past few years and both broke within a year... one was replaced, the other I didn't even bother to get fixed. It'll just break again. Beautiful vacuum but go for something that works better and lasts longer."
1,"luckily, i didn't expect much.","I purchased two of these, one for my apartment and one as a gift for my brother-in-law. Mine lasted for about 6 months before it just stopped working mid-vacuum session. I think the problem with mine is overheating. It works for about 5 minutes then stops but i am able to start it up the next day but only for a couple of minutes. My bro-in-laws stopped working even before mine. We both have small apartments (mine with short office-like carpet and tile, his with hardwood floors and one large wool carpet)and neither of us have pets. I was hoping we would get at least a year out of the vacuum, but unfortunately, was let down. I will say that the suction and pick up, initially, is great and the vacuum cleans very very well. In the end, if you are looking to buy, spend the extra money and buy something more dependable."
2,Ok product for the moment,The product works ok just to get you by until you purchase a real vacuum cleaner. The price is cheap and you will get just what your money paid for. Don't go for the fancy $500 vacuum but keep in mind this ain't the one either.
2,Overheats ALL the time!,"I agree with many of the reviews: light, decent suction for its size and cost, decent length cord for a smallish apartment. However, my gripes are that ever since the weather has gotten warmer, this vacuum overheats constantly! (As the manual says, when it overheats, the machine automatically shuts down. You have to let it cool for 30 min. before turning it back on.) It'll shut down after five minutes of continuous vacuuming! Also, my other gripe is that the red finish rubs off easily on the white walls in my apt. If the vacuum accidentally falls over and hits the wall, expect a bright red mark. For what it's worth, it's so-so!"
2,Throws everything out,When I first got this Vac I LOVED it. I loved how easy it was to go from hard floors to rugs it was perfect. After I had it for at the most 6 months it started throwing out everything it sucked in. It was great while it lasted it cleaned rugs perfectly but I just wish it would've lasted longer!
2,lot of noise and overheating,After having this vacuum for about 6 months I was at first satisfied but not so much now. I have a 2 bedroom apartment with hardwood in the living room and carpet in the bedrooms. This vacuum overheats and cuts off before I can finish the 2nd bedroom. It takes forever to cut back on. It makes so much noise I thought something was wrong with it until I read other users complaining as well. The beater brush has to be constantly de-tangled of the carpet fibers which get caught in it. Cleaning the dust cup is an absolutely nasty affair and has to be done after vacuuming each room. As for the positives...it does clean relatively well when it is working.
3,a little sad,"I was so excited when my Hoover S2220 made it to my front door. I had read so many good reviews about it. It does work well. My complaint, that makes me very sad, is that it gets so hot. I feel like it will overheat if I use it too long at a time. I find myself cutting back on what I would be doing with it just to make sure it doesn't overheat. I don't know if there is something wrong with my particular vacuum or if that is just what is to be expected. I bought it to do quick touch-ups in between regular vacuuming. Oh well..."
5,This thing sucks!,"The first time I turned this on I was completely surprised by its sucking power! Really its a great vacuum, although it is almost to powerful to use the carpet function on any of my rugs(Persian & a small carpet runner). The carpet function works great on Berber rugs though...No more sweeping for me, now it only takes a few minutes to clean the floor in the whole house :-) thanks!"
4,I loved the first one I bought,"I really liked my first Flair Hoover I bought, so I bought another one. I like it but it doesn't pick up as well as the first one. I thought it would be just as good so I didn't keep the box. I wish I had because maybe it was just a faulty one.I would have sent it back to try another one.Thanks bunches,Nana"
4,Excellent Purchase/Fair Price,"Finally, I found a product that works as expected and descibed.....lightweight and powerful.......a Good Buy if you are an apartment and pet owner! Fully satisfied."
5,Great little vacuum,This vacuum really works well on bare floors or carpets. I use it almost every day instead of my broom on my hardwood floors. It gets into small places and does exactly what I need it to do. It's also very easy to empty and clean. I recommend it highly!
3,Amazon Order/Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum,"I ordered this stick vacuum because it was powered by electricity with an electrical cord and it was light weight and convenient.All the above mentioned assets are true; however, it is not powerful enough to pick uppet hair. I have two cats - one of which has long fur and I had hoped that this woulddo the job of removing the fur from the rugs and furniture. I was disappointed to find out that it doesn't, so I have gone back to using my more powerful vacuum that is a tank type with a power nozzle and does an excellent job of picking up dirt and pet hair but is heavier and more cumbersome to use.I am a senior citizen and was looking for a more convenient and lighter weight vacuum that I could quickly use on my rugs and stairs.The Hoover Flair Stick Vacuum with power nozzle S2220 is good for quick pick-ups on my kitchen floor which is linoleum, but I don't recommend it for cleaning rugs."
1,Save your money,I had this vacuum for a little over a year. It worked fairly well although we did not like the red scuffs it left on the woodwork nor the way the head would flip over. Then the head completely broke off the body and was irrepairable. It was only used perhaps 2x a week - my previous stick vac had lasted 10 years before it broke. Is it just me or should an appliance last beyond the warranty period?
3,Hoover S2220 Upright OK for small jobs,"I've used this product for 3 months now. It's lightweight, easy to use--turns easily. Very good for kitchen and hardwood floors. I'd recommend using it only for these areas.Below average for even small carpeted areas, and unacceptable for large carpets. Also, cord is too short.OK for the price."
2,Very disappointed!!,"I had one of these and it broke..The nozzle broke right off leaving it hanging by wires..I thought I may have gotten it stuck under the couch or something..I loved this vacuum so much, I ordered another one..I liked the way I could switch from bare floor to carpet...Picked up great, easy to clean.THEN....the nozzle to my new one broke...I did nothing..It broke in the same place, leaving it to hang by wires.I was so disappointed..Of course, I won't be ordering another one..In the trash it went.."
2,"hmmm, not so great","I was impressed by the reviews but disappointed in the results.The suction power is low, and i have wooden floors and a couple of rugs only.I need to clean the filter AND brush everytime to even get it's limited amountof suction to work."
4,more suck for the buck,Value for cost is exceptional. Household as no children or pets. More than getting the job done
2,"Works great for a while, but then...","it sucks, pun intended.I got mine for Christmas 2007 and it worked great for a year and a half or so, but now I can't run it for more than 5 minutes without it overheating and shutting down. I have to let it sit for an hour or so to cool down before I can finish the floor. I have a small efficiency/studio apartment so it's not like I am running it for hours on end. It should at least work well without constantly overheating."
3,Hoover Flair,"I bought this stick vacuum to replace one that was over 20 yrs old and specifically wanted a swivel head. The Flair vacuum works best on bare floors; has good suction and is easy to maneuver. The swivel head does make it relatively easy to get around ""most"" things, however it is a little too wide to get behind my toilets. The dirt filter cup is small, fills quickly and is very messy to clean. You end up with dirt on your hands."
4,Buy This Vacuum,"For the Money You cannot beat this thing. It's light weight, easy to store, and does a really good job on bare floors and I also clean all the throw rugs with the power nozzle. No bags to buy, really a money saver. We have a Jack Russell that sheds like crazy, this Hoover is great, picks up all the dogs hair with one pass. Great suction. Only small complaint is the power cord is a little to short. Get one."
5,Best Stick Vacuum Ever,"The Hoover S2220 Stick Vacuum is a great product, especially for the price. It performs as promised, picks up kitty litter very well and is great for vacuuming stairs. Best feature is that the power nozzle can be turned on for carpet and turned off for bare floors. With this feature it works well on both surfaces. And of course, it's lightweight."
4,Seems fabulous so far...,"This vac arrived swiftly from Amazon--like within 4 days of ordering even though it was just the normal free delivery. Very easy to assemble, seems durable, not too noisy, and seems to have a fair amount of suction for a smaller ""electric broom"" style vac. The only reason I have given it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I've only used it once and I wish to be prudent with my enthusiasm. But, using it one time, on my woefully dirty floors :o), it performed admirably."
2,ok - for light and limited use,"This vacuum worked great...for awhile. We've had it less than a year and now can't use it for longer than a few minutes at a time without it overheating. We empty the bin frequently, bought new filters, etc. and it still overheats. Maybe we just use it too frequently. And with three cats and a house full of hardwood floors, there's a lot to clean. Will be going with something more heavy-duty next time."
3,Ok for wood or time floors.,Not so good for area rugs. It doesn't pick up on carpet or my area rug. I was very disappointed because I thought it would be useful on both kinds of floor coverings.
3,Could be improved upon,"For the most part I like this vacuum, however there are a couple of things that could be done to make it better. The first is that it needs to come with an attachment to reach under appliances and into the crevices of couches and chairs. The second area which needs improvement has to do with it's mechanics. Once I used the carpet switch, which causes the rotater to turn, I now have to constantly turn the machine over and pull the dog hair from the bristols and funnel them into the suction nozzle.I have two large dogs that stay inside alot and they do shed alot so I am constantly vacuuming up their hair and it just sticks to the bristols of the rotater. Either the rotater needs to be removeable or there needs to be more room in the underside of the vacuum so the hair can bypass the bristols and flow right into the suction nozzle."
1,hated this,"First of all, this Hoover Flair is unweildy and not light weight. I used it only once and the front plastic cup mechanism that locks it into place did not work. The vacuum pulled yarns out of 2 4x6 area rugs. You cannot use this on a rug that has any kind of embroidery as it will tear it up even on the 'bare floor' setting. Hair, fur, yarns and such get caught up in the brush roller quickly and you have to manually remove them. On the 'floor' setting the vaccum did not pick up kitty litter, though the suction seems strong. The Hoover Flair is VERY VERY loud!! I am returning this vaccum immediately."
5,Works Great.,The Hoover S2220 works as expected. Of course the cord has to be unwound and rewound but that inconvenience is more than compensated by the lack of power die off after several minutes that is so symptomatic of it's cordless competitors.
5,Nice Vacuum!,"I Love this little Vacuum! Great Power for a stick vacuum! I Use it on my kitchen Floor instead of the broom. Picks up the dogs hair Great, and anything just about anything else. Get's under stuff also. I am very happy with it."
5,Great little helper,I think this Hoover is terrific. We have three large dogs and a kitchen rug that is mainly black. Golden Retriever hair falls out all over even if you furminate them so daily cleaning is a must. The vacuum is terrific on the floor and carpet. I'd be lost without it.
1,Great when it works. Overhearts ALL THE TIME.,"This vacuum worked great for a few months, then it started to overheat and shutoff. Once it shuts off, it is a long time before it will turn back on. Sometimes it shuts off after 2-3 minutes of use.I have a 900sf apartment, with mostly hardwood floors. This was a good size vacuum for that. I didn't want a huge heavy vacuum.I am disappointed when things I buy break because of a poor product. It seems companies only care about cost. The low cost of this item does not make warranty repair viable. I think Hoover knows that and they don't care."
2,6 1/2 months (2x a month) and it doesn't work right anymore,"Like everyone else, I loved the Flair because it was lightweight, stood alone, and worked on both carpet and bare floor, the latter of which I have a lot of. Several weeks ago, it stopped vacuuming on the bare floor level (but, strangely, is still working on the carpet level, maybe because I don't have much). I trusted the good reviews and thought the bad reviews were just isolated instances. My bad! As they say, you get what you pay for, but shouldn't it last more than 13 times? (It also overheats and then just cuts out for a while, as others have noticed.)"
4,Rating,"Overall I really like this product; however, a couple of things I would mention are: 1. Need a longer electric cord to reach further; 2. The handle (top one) that holds the cord when not in use is loose allowing the cord to fall when storing. I cannot see a screw for this to possibly adjust."
3,okay for the price,"Okay for a quick clean, but not a very powerful vacuum. The head is small, so it requires more passes to clean an area thoroughly. Not a vacuum I would choose for deep cleaning."
5,best small vac i have had in years,love lthis little vacuum. it does almost as good a job as my 'monster wind tunnel'. great for quick clean up on carpet and bare floors.thank you hoover!
2,decapitated!,"This vacuum was a great for everyday use instead of taking out the large heavy duty vacuum cleaner. It has good power and gets corners well. I was fairly happy with it until after a little over year of using it, the head snapped off. it has a plastic neck and the top is too heavy for it. It's also hard to free-stand the thing while you are futsing with the cord, etc... Also, be careful - the red paint comes off on the wall. Now my white bed skirt has red on it, and so does the white paint on the rise of the steps. Buying a different vacuum cleaner this time."
1,"Derivative, Waste of Time","In trying to grab a piece of the ""Bridget Jones"" market, Dalton shows herself to be a shallow, uninteresting writer who can't compete with the admittedly low brow but great fun to read ""Jones."" From the other reviews I'd guess this author is from Ohio. Otherwise why would so many people from there be writing great reviews of this book? Don't waste your time or money on this one. There are too many really well written books out there..."
4,"Fine cable, if you can get the package open","A fine cable at a fine price (six feet, by the way), but packaged in one of those double-walled blister packs that requires some serious tools (and risk of injury) to open."
2,"This cookbook is OK, if OK is good enough for you.","This book would be fine for someone who is curious about Persian food, but wants a simplified version of it, but the food is not authentic. The author has changed the recipes to make them slightly easier to cook (except for the times when the recipes aren't clear), and has eliminated the need to search for a Persian market for special ingredients. Sadly, for people looking for really, really good Persian food, it is the special ingredients and extra work that make it the most delicious food in the world."
1,Ugh...,"Oh for the love of god, dont be cheap, go buy Medal ofHonor..heck, you can get Metal Gear Solid for cheap now!I'mashamed to of ever put this in my Playstation..the graphics are poor..the gameplay's slow and lacks the action the game promises..the music sounds like a MIDI..The fact the game's cheap dosent have anything to do with the quality, all playstation games are going to end up like this shortly, the programmers just took a very, very...very wrong turn somewhere with this one. Somehow I doubt the Dreamcast version will be any better."
2,A Decent game if you're in to army stuff,"I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game. The graphics are not really anything speical. It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life. The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly. The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence. The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys. I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself. The missons seem a bit vague and you think ""okay... what the heck do I do now?"" too often. When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault..... Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first. If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter."
1,Bad Design Flaws,"Unless you have supernatural powers to rival those of your enemies or like to lose, don't waste your time on the game. This shouldn't be called Stealth Patrol, there's no stealth involved."
2,Frustration,"THe only good thing about this game is that you can play with a buddy and both die together. The controls are confusing. When I attempt to change my weapons from my inventory I invariably get shot. I thought the ""Private"" level would let me get used to the game. I cannot last more than 3 minutes here! If this is easy I cannot imagine the difficult levels. Please save your money."
3,This book has been extremely helpful for me,"I work at home (I'm a travel writer), and I feel like I never could escape all my ""stuff"". This book was an excellent way to think through how I wanted my life to be organized, plus excellent tips to get me there."
4,Organizing from the Inside Out : The Foolproof System for Or,"This book refreshes a lot of things that you already knew but never really put into action, and it gave you new ways to look at things. I highly recommend it!"
2,"Yah, like I have the time to read this!","If I had the time to read this 9-point-font, 240 page book, I'd have the time to reorganize. It may be all of what other readers claim it to be, but they must have lots more time on their hands then I do. Truly, I am glad it works for others, but in short it does not work for me. More daunting than the task(s) at hand!"
4,No time?,"This is a great book that really helped me get my life organized. Considering how much of your life can be reclaimed by simply organizing your surroundings, I believe that the return on investment is the worth the cost and time spent reading the book. I wonder how ""busy professionals"" don't have time to read a 240 page book, but somehow have plenty of time to surf the net and complain online about not having enough time to read about getting organized. For those ""busy""people lacking time for reading, I suggest that they turn off the computer and pick up a book instead of just reading about books at Amazon. Buy one, actually read it and perhaps change your life."
5,Now I Know My Problem!,"I've ordered several of this type of book trying to get myself out of clutter and organized, but this one finally helped me understand the source of the problem! I've just got TOO MUCH STUFF! The book gave many illustrations of various people and their particular type of clutter and I'm sure everyone can find themselves in one of them. One lady couldn't throw away a butter tub and now had hundreds. I saw myself in the person that just has too much stuff and no where to put it all. I was inspired to get rid of all the ""too good to throw out"" stuff like 5 spatulas or 4 ice cream scoops just because they were still good or belonged to Grandma (no I didn't throw them away, but found new homes for each still good item). The insights in this book made me read it cover to cover! I feel great when I open a kitchen draw that is neat and where everything has a place. Now the other books are good how-to's but this one got to the root of the problem. I recommend it highly."
3,"Basic Organizing with a New Twist but not up to the ""Hoopla""","I like Oprah and I like the author but... I found Morgensten to be skilled at relating to the reader but maybe I expected too much. This is an average organizing book with a new spin much like the a ""new diet fad"". I found validity in the words but I did not like the way the author slighted the ""Simplify Your Life"" approach of Elaine Saint James; this seemed rather passive aggressive. Ms. Morgensten may be onto something here but this book is just average. I would say at full price, it's not worth it. I gave it 3 stars."
4,Logical book with helpful hints,"This book is helpful for those of us who are chronically unorganized. Essentially, she says you need to organize according to your habits, have a plan before you start, label, and tackle one area at a time. She also gives example of problem organizers, so that the reader can identity themselves and where their problem may lie (do you have too much stuff, are you putting something too far away from your activity, do you have a ""home"" for everything?)Some readers may think the information is somewhat obvious, but for chronically messy people who really need a way to proceed and have failed organizing things in the past, this is a great book."
5,Great! Practical and detailed.,"I bought this book before moving to another house. I am NOT a neat-freak or an obsessive organizer - in fact, I've been pretty relaxed about mess so far in my life. However, the tips in this book have really improved the pleasure I feel at home, and my serenity and well being. Morgenstern gives very real, applicable advice and a method to follow. Realistic estimate of how long it will take to apply to each room. At first, I thought that her ""kindergarten model"" sounded a little anal - ""No way will I have a kitchen with labels on every shelf"" I thought. Well, guess what - I found myself buying a label making machine and now I have a fully organized kitchen and I LOVE it! How did I do it before? I actually ENJOY emptying the dishwasher and tidying up now!"
5,"Solid, readable biography of a complex woman","Not really a lot to add to the bulk of the reviews here, which are overwhelmingly positive. I concur. I know Bow as an icon of her (youthful) age and from a small handful of her films, but this gave me a wonderful, and full, picture of her vibrant, complex and really rather tragic life. It also provides a nice look at the times she lived and worked in and how they both (publicly) made her and then tore her down. Biography, object lesson, cautionary tale - Bow's life makes for a fascinating, absorbing read. Especially so for those with any interest in film history and the creation of a public image."
4,A non-fanciful look at the life of a hollywood sex symbol,"Clara was far more than most of the later works portray her to be. This book contains quote and insights from many of the people who worked with her, as well as an honest look at her troubled mental history. Clara is best known for role as sex symbol, and her dramatics are unfortunately overlooked, as so pointed out by this work. This book is a great read for true Clara fans because it focuses on what she achieved in spite of her problems, not becuase of them. I also liked the short spot at the end which reveals the sorry state of Hollywoods efforts to preserve its past from rotting away in aging film cannisters."
5,just good music for everyone,"the cd is good, catchy. but see this band live. they will blow you away. next release is rumored to be soon. I saw them open for tonic in chicago and they blew them away!!"
4,Unknown but Outstanding,"I bought this CD because I liked Oskar Saville's solo album. I looked to see what else she has done. I found Rubygrass. With elements of Natalie Merchant (which helps explain how she wound up with 10,000 Maniacs in 2004) this is an excellent album. Oskar Saville needs to be discovered!"
4,"Soft, comfortable bra","This bra isn't sexy, but it feels great. I've noticed some pilling on the outside of the cups after washing a few times, but that doesn't really bother me."
4,A Good Documentary Research Material,"This is a good source of real WW2 photos showing actual applications of WW2 uniforms and equipment. The selling point here are the rare pictures showing the experimental M-1943 uniform and equipment in it's ""prototype"" configuration.I would recommend this to researchers,collectors, and modellers of American WW2 militaria.RICHARD STEVE C. PAZPHILIPPINES!"
4,Perfect for relaxation,"When I first bought the cd, I thought it was going to be the songs sung by the original artist. Until I heard the oh so relaxing piano solo, (that even my two month old stops crying to hear the wonderful melody) I realized it wasn't. I definately recommend this cd for a long, relaxing bath or a good meditation in the bedroom...or even to calm a fussy newborn."
3,Not as good as the reviews made it out to be,"I am not sure why everyone was so high on this. The organization is a bit scattered and it doesn't really cover a great deal of code. If you are using this as a general learning book, it is ok. But if you are looking up specifics about something you are working on, I bet that most of the time it will let you down."
1,good collection but you can get it online,"This book (more than 500 pages) combined about 68 articles already published in ""Electrophoresis"" journal in 1999. The selected contents about proteome analysis (such as reviews, 2-DE, mass spectrometry, cell and tissue, ...) is categorized into different sections. It's good to review or find any approach and application about proteomics from these articles. But, this book is not worth if you can access the journal online (I mean you or your institution subscribe for it). I think I have about 99% of articles collected in this book in PDF files and some print out."
4,Questions answered,From previous 'reviews' - song titles are on the cover; the description states 'CD+G' (it provides graphics as well as song lyrics on your TV screen).Wow.
4,Sampa & Bahia together in a great pop album!,"Finally they made their partnership official. Do not take this album as a new ""tropicalist"" movement. Forget ""Mary Cristo"". Just enjoy the good musical teamwork. The voice of Marisa, the poetry of Arnaldo and the freshness & rhythm of Brown. A must have!"
3,I was waiting more of them...,"Together, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, three of the best artists of the MPB. One Album, 13 songs. When I finished listening all the songs, I was deceptionated. 13 songs, and, apart from ""Ja Sei Namorar"" and ""Velha Infancia"", no other really atracted me. Ok, ""Passe em Casa"", ""E Voce"" and ""Carnavalia"" were other good music, but the other songs appeared to me that they made quickly only to fill the rest of the CD.Tribalistas is a good CD, but I am still thinking that hear the old songs of Marisa Monte is better. However, take it if you really like Brazilian music or like any of the three musicians, you won't be deceptionated, even because ""Ja Sei Namorar"" and ""Velha Infancia"" are excellent songs and does not let the CD to be a complete waste of time."
4,Nice product,Great that it has multiple layers so it can be adjusted to fit. Velcro could be a little better. Happy with the product!
4,"cute gadget, not bright enough most of the colors","this is super cute gadget and my neice loves it. i may give it to her as bday gift next year, she is afraid of dark and used it 1 night when she had slumber party at my house. anyway it is a cute idea, but most of the colors are not light enough to brighten up my house. some are, like blue and purple. i would rather have a solar based light stick actually. but this is ok. should cost less, think it is worth $3 not $7."
3,Broke twice! Really bright!,"I don't know if we got a defective twice but within weeks the button stopped working and the light wouldn't go on anymore. We really liked the light otherwise. We used it in my sons room and it was a bit too bright to leave it on the color changing mode, so we left it on red and it gave a nice soft glow.But we sent it back and decided to just get a refund. We haven't found a replacement yet."
5,Great Night Light,"I was doubtful when I ordered this light as I have tried a couple of other light sensing night lights. They had to be put in a location that is well lit during the day or they'd be on all of the time.This one works perfectly, on at night, off when it's day. Great colors and adds a nice hue to ant room. I have purchased four of them so far."
2,Run narrow,"Had to return these.... I don't have an unusually wide foot, but these ran very narrow and didn't fit right. Surprising for Rockports...."
1,Not that good,I purchased this toy for my goddaughter for Christmas. Not even a month later the doll is not responding the way she is supposed to. Everything she is supposed to do is out of wack. She was fun while it lasted.
3,Rehased,This is rehashed material from other ernest dump bin dvds.. However it does have the hard to find ernest rides again.. Basically that is the selling point of this DVD.. Most ernest fans already have the other filler on this DVD
1,Only Good For Use As A Fly Swatter,"During the 10 years taking care of my mother and begging doctors and groups like the Alzheimer's Association to give me salient information, the only thing I ever heard was that I needed to read this book. Honestly the only thing I wanted to do was to take it out to my porch and set it on fire, for all the usefulness it had for me. Either that or using it to smack every person who told me to read it.It's frigging useless compared to the reality of dealing with someone with the disease."
1,The phone numbers don't connect,"I bought this book last week. Much to my distress, half of the phone numbers listed don't connect. What's going on????????"
2,I agree,"I agree with the last comment. I looked at the Yale guide at the bookstore, and compared it to the Internship Bible. It's just a copy of the Bible, but less. In all fairness, while the Yale Internship Guide isn't very good, I do like the Yale College Guide. I used it back when I was applying to schools in 89/"
4,read this book!!!!,"when you get home after the midnight showing of Revenge of the Sith, read this book!!! it deals with events about 3-4 months after ROTS and is very surprising. the inclusion of a certain jedi somebody from Obi-Wan's past is brilliant!!!! having Ben Kenobi spy on little baby luke is heartwarming having Obi-Wan remember all of his fallen friends and loved ones is heart-breaking. Realy a great way to deal with the heartache and action Episode III's sure to bring, and move us along into the rebellion era. because here's something to think about there are 18 years between episode III and IV....is Obi-wan at the end of Revenge the same man we see as ""old man"" Ben in episode IV? what can 18 years of grief, frustration, and fear look like for a Jedi. and maybe most importantly for the fans...how does Obi-Wan learn to become one with the force in A New Hope?"
4,The Del-Lords Best Of...,"I have made a few changes to the Best of.Here are the 18 songs that should have been on the CD. How can you leave off Soldier's Home and Against My Will?Nevertheless, it's still as good a band as there was.How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And LiveGet ToughLivin' On LoveI Play the DrumsBurning In The Flame Of LoveShame On YouHeavenLove Lies DyingSoldier's HomeAgainst My WillCrawl In BedJudas KissThe Cool and The CrazyCheyenneWhole Lotta Nothin' Goin' OnYou and ILove on FireAbout You"
1,don't do it!,"I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.Sorry!"
1,Rain Riding Techniques: A Guide to Wet Weather,"This book certainly wasn't what I expected. I paid $15 for a book that took me 30 minutes to read and didn't have any more helpful information on riding your motorcycle in wet weather than what I had already read in David Houghs book Proficient Motorcycling. If you want my advice, don't waste your hard earned money on this one!"
3,Is completely clear no option?,The reason I purchased this product was so I could lessen the chance of dropping this pricey phone/computer. The choices of color are not very male friendly but understand that flat black would not be very useful. Snug fit and very flexi. I have not yet dropped this phone.
1,The mystery of my order,"I ordered this item on July 5. It is currently after September 30th, the last end-date of the last delay amazon.com gave me, and I still haven't gotten it. It has been delayed three times, but I've only been updated about these changes at least a day after the estimated delivery date. According to a few e-mails from Amazon, their supplier is being slow and not notifying them. Their new 'estimated delivery date' is October 28 through November 14th.I have read the first two books of the series, and believe that I will like the next four, that is, if I ever get them."
3,Frustrating for the under 7 crowd,"My children got Finding Nemo and Rugrats All Grown-up both for Christmas. While the Finding Nemo game is more exciting, and has better graphic, they have never made it past level 2. The best feature on the Rugrats All Grown-up is the map showing your location and what you are trying to locate. It gives the kids a shot at accomplishing the task. The Finding Nemo could use this feature. The kids have stuck with Finding Nemo more than the Rugrats All Grown-up game but do voice their frustation."
3,Fun until you get to the level w/ Bruce,"This is a great game and had fun playing it until I got to the level with bruce the shark. First of, you have to swim through the field of mines and its really hard because they are all really close together. The one time I did make it past that I found out that the next level is rrrrreeeeeaaaaalllllly hard!!!!!!!! It's the part where Bruce goes mean and is trying to eat you. You have to dash away really fast before he catches you WHILE dodging walls and other things. It might sound easy but it's not! I suggest you don't buy this game and spend your money on a different game."
3,cool game. not exiting,Cool game. Not exiting. I bought this for game boy advance and it sucks. Yes its by the moive but it is not exiting.
2,fun but very hard,"I like this game, but don't play it any more. I got it for new year with my own gameboy. Ok what I like about this game is that you can pick up some thing and throw it. I also like the 3D stuff like chase Dory or chase the turtle that said '' hey dude ''. Also it starts out simple like first level, going to school. Second level, going out to find your classmates and returning them to the sting ray guy. But the best part of this game is I one time just typed in something in the cheat code place, and without knowing, I got too the last level. What I don't like about this game is that it is too hard. This game is for people who want a challenge."
4,Great game!,"My son received this game for his fifth birthday. It is a great game. He has lots of fun playing it. You alternate between being Nemo and Marlin. Some of the levels are a little too hard for him and he needs some help to get past them, but overall I think it is a great game and not too hard, even for my young son. I also enjoy playing it, so it is great for multiple players in the household!"
1,Who the...? What the...? Are you kidding with this?,"Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that, my friends, is a sad, sad thing indeed.The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all. Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.I love GTA. It's a great game, but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999. It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar."
1,What is this crap?,"I bought this game and I have to say that this is a game worth NOT buying because I have been a gamer all my life and I have never turned off a video game within a minute of playing time.1. Controls are horrible.2. Who cares that the charecter can burp and fart3.The graphics are ridicuous for a playstion one system. These are the kind of graphics that you would find on the the first video game systems ex: Atari, NES or game boy pocket. If you want a game that you would like buy any of the GTA games on the playstion 2 system. Dont buy this game."
1,Why play 2D when the is 3D?,"This game is purely out of date. Top view game play just make you sick, just go get Driver instead."
4,Stress Buster,"After playing the first GTA for hours while in college, I was pleased to see an upgraded version finally released. Although I expected graphics similar to Driver (the graphics turned out to be like the first game)it was still very fun. I would not recommend this game for children, but for any adult seeking an outlet for stress this is undoubtedly the perfect choice. One thing about the game that I do not like though is the fact that it takes ""forever"" to proceed to the next level. All in all though I give this game one and a half thumbs up."
2,It's ok,Hello i bought this game when it came out and it was ok. The cool part about it is how easy it is. I can get to the highest wanted level which makes it fun because then the army comes after you and you get to steal them. That was the good point now for the bad points. The graphics are terrible and i mean terrible. They are not realistic and it is a sky view. Also the shooting has no aim at all which makes the game harder.
1,Wow bad,"I went in thinking it was gonna be something cool like gangsta ewoks. I came out feeling violated like that kid in clockwork orange forced to watch snuff films for weeks. The only thing I learned about people in the third world is they have bad teeth, and it took 2 hours for this movie to tell me that. Dont watch this move, and surely dont buy this movie, cause it doesnt just steal your money it steals 2 hours of your life that would be better spent picking the lint out of your bodily orfices..."
5,staggering,"This is a message movie, but what seperates this from other message movies is that this film tells you nothing... but it shows you so much. It's relevance has only increased since it's initial release almost twenty years ago. Unfortunately the DVD is still out of print. It is possible to obtain a genuine DVD by making a donation to the organization that produced the film. It's not cheap but it will help them finally put it back in print so that others can easily order a copy from ... Do an ... search for Koyaanisqatsi... ... The DVD looks fantastic."
3,I really wanted to like this game.,"I really did, It's stylish, has great graphics, and great responsive controls.But there are too many problems with this game, making it frustrating. First off the get the checkpoints in any order is a really annoying way to race. And while I don't mind a challenge I don't want to play a race 20 times until I beat it if it's not fun after the first 5. The gamemakers really should have put in an difficulty setting, instead of making you use a cheat code which either makes it way too easy or doesn't seem to do anything at all.There are problems with the controls. Not the steering, the steering is tight and feels natural; none of the button set-up make much sense. Another problem is no option to use your own soundtracks as BGM. Every other racing game I've ever played on the Xbox has had this option so why not this one?While the game has a nice sense of speed and style, it's just not nearly as fun as Burnout 2."
2,legs can't be secured,"The product is made well except for one fatal flaw. The legs telescope but won't stay out. Other telescoping items can be turned to secure them. These legs collapse with any movement or in certain positions. I'm trying to think of a way to make them not slip closed so easily, such as an anti-WD40 spray. Maybe just some dirt and scratching?Seriously, I would love it fine if I could get a feeling of security once positioned."
5,"A ""COLOR PROFUSION"" of QUALITY MUSIC!","What a wonderful mix of songs that will appeal to all ages. All aspects of this CD are superbly done--vocals, mixing, instrumentation, arranging, cover art and all with that Robert Lamm originality. If you like great guitars, fun-to-sing lyrics and good rythym, ""The Love of My Life"" is one that will stay ""in YOUR head"" for days! Then add the sparkling voice of Phoebe Snow to duets like ""The Best Thing"" and ""Swept Away"" and you definitely have hit material. This CD is fast becoming ""The Best Thing"" yet by Robert Lamm! Congratulations to you Robert, and to Mystic Music! Looking forward to more like this in the future. Thanks!"
2,"Some good material, needs acoustic drums & brass","Upon listening to the tracks on this CD I must say that some of the music really has potential. I could have had alot more feeling and drive. Meaning, the synthetic percussion and brass lines really cheapen the overall product. Any serious music listener is going to be disappointed upon hearing these uncanny sounds. Robert can certainly afford to hire a top call drummer and brass section. The horn sounds in ""Sacrifical Culture"" are practically laughable in some sections. In other areas, it almost pulls it off, but doesn't quite make it. The drum sounds are remniscent of the little Casio keyboards of the '80s with a drum patch. Come on, do it right! The music deserves it and I believe the listeners would benefit as well. On the good side, the singing of Phoebe Snow is entrancing with that soulful sound and style. ""Watching the Time Go By"" is a nice walk back in time with a nostalgic edge. So, please hire a drummer and brass section for the next record!"
2,anime?!,"I just to a glips this book and I look at it and thought ""anime?!"" the answer was no. It was to cartoony.Yes it's a could book to draw cartoons but not anime. For instance look at Salior moon, Rayearth or Yu-gi-oh then look at this book do the look a like? If you want to learn real anime don't get this book you could get better ones for less. THIS IS A NOTE IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING ANY OF HIS MANGA MANIA BOOKS when you see the great art on the front it isn't his he hires people to do a whole chunk of the book and the front and back of the book for him then like only a small amount is his work and on the front of the book it says the book was by him. What did he do besides put no-anime charaters in it?! That's what I'm still trying to find out.Back to this book if you can see the front of the book doesn't look good on the cover. If the covers bad isn't the book going to be the same? So If you want to learn anime I recemendbooks that at least look like anime."
2,NOT ENOUGH STEP-BY-STEP,"There isn't enough step by step instuction. Its a goof-off and a terrible excuse for a instuction booklet. I think that it's okay if you had maybe one or two classes to learn to draw, but for a complete and total beginner...Let's just say I got better direction from free sites on the web."
4,"Bright Lite, usable","It was pretty much what I expected...I do agree with a previous customer who said that the light was much brighter than really needed, even in complete darkness-I will probably wrap a piece of cloth over it to dim it a little-guess manufacturer is trying to err on the side of brighter rather than too dim. Was a bit bulky, but still effective, especially for those times an idea/dream pops into your head, you can grab it off the nightstand and pen it on paper :o)"
5,"'So Real"" is so cute!","I typically don't listen to this kind of music, but the song 'Candy' caught my attention quick. I liked the song so much I bought the CD. All of the songs are from a teen's perspective. I'm well past my teens, and bubble gum music like Britney Spears or the Backstreet Boys usually makes me sick to my stomache, but this CD is so much better and so much fresher than some of that stuff that Britney Spears sings about! Britney is still a teen, but yet she tries to sing about things that are too mature for her. Mandy is a teen, a young one at that, and she sings about things that she has probably already dealt with. That's what makes her music so much better. Even though her music has a message that's probed towards teens, it's music that anyone can listen to and like!"
1,"I'm not try'in to be mean, but So Real deserves one star","When i first put So Real into my CD player, the first thing I noticed was the lack of effort put into the CD. It really seemed as if Mandy strolled into the record studio, and some people wrote some songs for her in a hurry, and after an hour she had a CD. Thats the problem with a lot of artists, they don't put any quality time and effort into their songs. I'm sorry to add to the bunches and bunches of low ratings, but we are all correct in saying that this CD is bad."
1,what a disappointment,"when i first heard candy, i was like, "" turn it off!"" but, then it grew onme and i thought it was cute. i was going to buy the single but couldn't find it anywhere! well, then my friend cam over with the cd. i was listening to candy over and over, then it got boring so i checked out the other songs on it. nothing good. i was like ""what is this"" i was hoping that some of her other songs woold be as catchy and cute as candy, but none of them were. take my advice, if you like the song candy, try to buy the single, save your money and don't buy the cd. it's really nothing special."
3,Not the best but better than some of the rest,"Surprisingly I found this to be a pretty decent album. I heard some of the samples and thought about just buying the single of ""Candy"". If I did that I would be making a mistake. There are many songs on this cd that are worth the money like ""Lock Me In Your Heart"". Don't try to compare this to Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears because she really isn't like that. Christina Aguilera is in a catagory all her own! Britney Spears' music is alright, but there are maybe 3-4 songs on the entire cd that are decent."
1,Anything but real...,"Mandy's album has to be the most amazing collection of garbage ever placed on silicon. Poor girl. She doesn't seem to realize that she can't sing, and is little more than a toy of her writers and record company owners. The meaningless drivel smattered on these tracks is disgusting. What the hell is ""missing you like candy?"" Uh, is that a compliment or...what? Where is the content to this music? Where is the music? There's nothing but a drum beat and some fluffy sound effects on every single one of these terrible songs. I abhor everything this album is and represents."
1,Umm..how about NOT?,"Please don't waste your time or money on this CD. A friend of mine has it and it completely pointless, the songs are STUPID, and she really has no talent. She's just another pretty faced pop princess, but the least talented of them all. (Okay, maybe she's a little above Britney). The songs are just stupid..and she has to have a REPRISE on it? talk about someone not wanting to write enough songs for her! Don't waste your time on this. Go get Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera instead if you want good voices and songs."
3,another brandy?..but better,"I have just heard her samples and they all remind me of black songs, which is okay. her one song, ""Lock me in Your Heart,"" sounds like Brandy's, ""Angel In Disguise."" Which is cool if you like Brandy. I do not like Brandy but her songs are cool. So if you wanna listen to a younger brandy of another race, then this album sounds like it could take you there. The thing is though, the album sounds like Brandy's first Cd, something in the early ninties. So perhaps maybe, you'd wanna borrow this album from a friend and dub it, so you'll have nothing to lose just to be on the safe side but the dollar it took to buy the blank tape. But Mandy's album cover is something I'd pick up because of the pretty cover...if I was stupid enough to do such a thing."
1,Give her a break? SHE CAN'T SING!,"Excuse me... To all you people out there who are saying, ""Give Mandy a break! She's only 15!"": the main point here that she can't sing, 15 or not 15. It's so obvious, and even more obvious in the song ""Quit Breaking my Heart, that her voice has been digitally remastered in the recording studio. This CD isn't good, period."
5,Great CD for a talented young rising star,"Hey, i am sick and tired off all the bad reviews. this cd is fantastic, i think more people judge her on her looks, not on her talent. Mandy is gonna be a star, with this great cd it'll hopefully get her recognized. What's wrong with someone getting a early start on their career?This Cd has a lot of catchy nice songs, basically i love all of them. It's so unfair to compare her to Britney or Christina, i think Mandy's CD is better than both of them's. This cd is great, forget about all of the teen stars out there and put her right in there, listen to the voice and the music, she's awesome!"
2,nice songs....poor vocals,"mandy has nice songs on her album....but it seems like she's trying too hard to copy the other pop princesses (christina, britney etc) her vocals aren't that great too...but like i said...nice songs...ps-does anyone notice how weird her lips move when she sings in her mtvs?"
2,"Sorry, Mandy, ur not there yet...","I listned to Mandy Moore's CD So Real. It was a smart thing to do, too because I figured that before I bought it, I should listen first. The only reason I was going to buy it was b/c I liked Candy. Well, none of her other songs have the umph that Candy has and they are too ""raw"" - I feel like not enough time was put into them to make them good. Her voice is alright... it isn't exactly the BEST. Her videos are annoying and her attitude is fake... I know that has nothing to do with the CD, but it gives some background on the artist. Unless her next CD proves me wrong, I don't think she has the ability to be a major celebrity... Sorry Mandy!"
3,Just about what you'd expect from another blond Mouseketeer!,"After hearing ""Candy"" and reading the reviews here, I thought I'd buy this cd. However, I was disappointed. I'm not going to compare her to Britney or Christina, but I am going to say that her music is just about the same as Britney's pop songs. The only songs worth listening to on the track are the first five. Luckily, all you internet surfers get to hear a clip of those (trust me though, a clip is all you really want to hear!). Mandy could certainly have some potential (more than Spears), but I wouldn't hold my breath for her album to become #1. But when she matures and gets all these ""I was in love once; too bad it was just a crush"" songs out of her system she could be a really talented artist. It's not a totally bad buy. ""Walk Me Home"" and ""Lock Me in your Heart"" prove to sound original and sweet, but I would wait until the cd hits the sales rack."
5,Mandy is the best!,Mandy Moore is by far the most outstanding new pop artist of the year. Her awsome voice and great songs make her so much higher in talent then Britany Spears or Jessica Simpson. Thank you Mandy Moore for giving us awsome music to listen to! -Lia
3,cute with potential,"i like mandy moore. she's really cute and her music resembles who she is. Because she's so young, her music plays a role in that lack of experience style. she will do better in the future. she'll be here for a while."
1,Mandy is a waste of my time and money.,"I cant beleive I was so stupid and musically un-enlightened to buy this CD. I actually thought that Candy was pretty cool, and that i should buy the CD. Big Mistake. So Real was the worst 13 bucks I've ever spent, and I really wish I could have downloaded Candy or something cause it is the only thing that the allbum has going for it. Every thing elase on the album was bad songwriting (and singing) and I hope that Mandy's fake personality and awful singing go away soon."
2,Interesting album but not good in songwriting,Mandy Moore is cute but that isn't saving grace. Candy is a fairly good song but I think that her tone control is lacking. I suggest that she could be a female rapper instead. I would think that she ought to be a hard-core b-girl and fare better as that because she has really instrumental and melodic flow but her tone is off. I suggest that Columbia House ought to move her to def jam because that's what she's best at definitely.
1,Fairly disappointing CD,"OK, I think the music world is already full of girl soloist, and Mandy is NOT a welcome addition. Her CD is a clumsy creation by pop producers, and don't get me started on how annoying and dull her voice is. It is amazing how a dumb, pretty blonde with a bad voice can walk into a record studio and her own CD."
1,"Mandy is OK, but her CD isn't","OK, we've seen this way to many times: Pretty girl gets record contract, pretty girl gets a single to launch her career, pretty girl makes a music video of it, pretty girl releases her CD, and pretty girl becomes annoying and overrated. This is Mandy I'm talking about. There is really nothing at all great about Mandy Moore. Her singing is adequate at best, so is her dancing, and her songs are OK, but none of them have hit written all over them. The other girl-pop stars all have something really good about them that makes them special (Britney with her cool songs and moves, and Christina with her awesome voice). Mandy really isn't anything special at all, and her CD is rather boring, nothing we haven't heard before."
4,Never a dull moment,No one realy know's Mandy Iguess. I met Mandy Moore once.She is the kindest lady I evermet. Mandy Moore is one singerthat put's her heart into hersinging. Mandy you can bet onit that me and Ted would payany price to her you sing yourheart. We love you.
1,Totally filler music,"Do you guys know what filler music is? Well, it is the songs that go into a CD with the good songs to get a complete CD. Basically it is the bad stuff between the good songs. I know that almost every CD has ""filler"" music, bt Mandy's CD is totally filler music. Candy is the only OK song, but all of the other ones there are jus there to make a complete CD for Candy. If you like Candy, buy the single for god's sakes and save some money. Otherwise you will annoy yourself to death with all of the filler music on the CD."
3,Spicy girl pop,"Amanda Leigh Moore has said that she recalls the moment when, as a 6-year-old ""jumping on my bed and singing"" in her Orlando home, she decided to chase her pop-music dreams. That epiphany may lack the historical impact of, say, Elvis truckin' to the Sun studios for the first time or Paul catching John's act at a Liverpool church festival. But Mandy, now 15 and a pop pro whose dance hit ""Candy"" has sold more than 500,000 copies and built a buzz for this debut album, earns credit for perseverance. Another product of the Orlando bubblegum factory that gave us the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, Moore skips along the same sultry but virginal girl-on-the-verge path cleared by Britney Spears. Yet like her idol Madonna, Moore relies on chutzpah to overcome the limitations of a voice that can sound as flimsy as the pop she produces. Still, you may admire the sass of such lines as ""I'm not too young to know the right thing to do/ And one of those things is not to fall for you."""
3,So Real - Mandy Moore,"This album is focused around basic teen relationships. She has a high-pitched voice for those who can handle it. When I first bought this album, I didn't really find and ""catchy"" tunes that were stuck in my head for the whole day but after re-listening to this a few times, the songs seemed to get better. She didn't write any of her songs, but I liked ""So Real"", and ""Walk me Home""."
2,Doesn't cut straight.,Doesn't cut straight especially in last quarter of the cut. The blade is sharp but the arm seems slightly curved.
4,Slow Starter,"I was really asking myself at the beginning of the movie, ""Why did I buy this?,"" but by the end I thought it was pretty cute. I bought it for my neice who loved the fact that there was a ghost in it. Overall I would have to say that it was pretty good, but I think it is an acquired taste."
1,WHAT?!? NO WIDESCREEN?!?!?!?,"OK, OK, OK... *sigh*.....Now I know that perhaps the core audience for this type of movie is p'rhaps tiny little children and that p'rhaps tiny little children don't really care, when their favorite iddy biddy heroines zip around the screen, if that screen is full or wide, but COME ON PEOPLE!!! No widescreen release at all!!!???There are so many dark and foreboding things said about our society when --despite the fact it was a major motion picture release, despite the fact that it was run in theaters just earlier this very year, and despite the fact that the original feature was produced in widescreen-- there is no widescreen DVD release offered to the viewers that do happen to care very deeply about these things!!!...deep breath... count to 10...I'm sorry, I'm just too emotionally disturbed to go on and on and on and on at this time. Hrrumph!!!"
4,An Awesome Beginning!!!,"This movie introduces the Powerpuff Girls before they became superheroes. Professor Utonium wants to make the perfect little girl with sugar, spice, and everything nice. His destructive chimpanzee named Jojo pushes him into the Chemical X, and causes a huge explosion. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are born with superhuman abilities. They accidentally tear up Townsville while playing tag. They are not wanted until Mojo Jojo tries to rule the planet, so the girls decide to help stop him and save the day. I highly recommend THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE!!!"
4,It's fine,It's the Power Puff Girls movie. I do not know what more can be said about it. My 6 year old enjoys it.
3,Where is my commentary and second disc?,"I love this film, it is another smashing success in the Pixar lineup. I am however, sorely disappointed by the lack of a 2-disc edition with real bonus features and a commentary track. If these special features are good enough for a film like Pirates, why not Ratatoullie?"
5,YAMMY!!,"It's always a pleasure to whatch a new movie from Pixar, those kinetic wizards of shiny sculpted animation who gave us the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo, and Cars, because it's a safe bet that you're in for a sparkly good time -- or, just maybe, a great one. In the case of the antic kiddie gourmet comedy Ratatouille, which might be described as Anatole the mouse meets Emeril Live, the expectations are high: The writer-director is Brad Bird, who made The Incredibles (2004), and it would be hard to name an animated film, from Pixar or anyone else, that was ever more incredible. So... Enjoy!!!"
1,Disc Skips and Pauses,I am rating this disc low as I watched it two nights ago and it pauses and skips to the next chapter 3 times. Not sure how much of the movie is lost but needless to say I was a bit disappointed.
2,Very serious movie compared to the Shrek,This movie is very serious compared to the Shrek. I found very few funny moments. The cartoon characters are lively and beautiful.It's worth renting.
2,Incredibly DUMB human interface production,"The content is great. The Blu-Ray implementation however is incredibly BAD. Most high-def disks are plagued with the security driven delays and failure to resume or pause the film easily. This one is an order of magnitude worse. Even with the latest firmware on my Pioneer Elite player, it can take several minutes to start or return to the film. Leave it paused for a few minutes and the disk will require going through the several minutes to reaccess, at which time you then need to step through the chapters etc.These guys have got to be kidding! My wife said she won't watch another one and got up and left the room in frustration."
1,disappointed,"My son has loved every Pixar movie so far so his reaction to this movie was new for me. We went to see this movie today and he asked to leave half way through. I understand that it's a kids movie, but this is not Pixar's best effort."
4,Pretty fun and cute,"My daughter likes it and it is fun and cute. As an adult I don't mind watching it with my daughter, even though I might not choose it by myself. I like the message also."
5,Ratatouille,Loved this movie! Bought originally for my grandson to watch and my husband and I watched it and loved it! A must see for everyone!!
1,Boring,This movie really draaaaaaaaaags in spots and is boring. Too many monologues by the main character. My kids get bored with it.
5,Great Family Movie,"This is just a fabulous family movie, both for the Kids and for any adult who likes food... Well worth adding to your film library..."
2,Okay,"This movie is not really clever and I did not enjoy it. Comedy and stupidity are two very different things, and I would classify Ratatouille as the latter. Definitely would not recommend!"
5,not just for kids,"Though this is an animated movie, the folks at Pixar and Disney give plenty for adults to enjoy as well. In addition to the special effects, the subject matter is quite accurate as far as cooking and Paris. I enjoyed it!"
3,DVD Ratatouille,A bit behind in reviews. Enjoyed this movie at theater better than DVD. Not one of my fav movies but enjoyable nontheless.
5,absolutely splendid!,"I'd been waiting since Finding Nemo for a good Disney movie. I'm 18 years old, and obsessed with Disney movies since I was little. This pleased my craving for an excellent new Disney experience."
5,great movie,watched it second time with my grand kids. We all love the movie and enjoyed it very much. One of the best one.
3,Movie is okay...,This movie is okay but not a family favorite. I think we should have watched it before we bought it. I was happy with how quickly we received it and everything else.
2,"Rataouille Has Charm, But It Is'nt Enough","Ratatouille is the Pixar movie which I thought would bring back the magic of Pixar which the studio seems to have lost after Cars, which I consider their worst film yet. Ratatouille has its moments of humor, emotion and beautiful visuals, but the film still lacks. The characters just arent engrossing enough. Perhaps the fact that Pixar tries to mix two different worlds of characters causes this confusion. Not only is the film giving us a glimse of the world of hungry rodents, but we also get a look at the human world. This leaves the characters litte time to develop and leaves things hanging out there with no real closure. Overall a poor attempt by Pixar, yet it's something which is worth watching once, but worth buying? I dont think so."
5,Adorable,This movie is adorable and a Must have for Disney movie collections. The characters are very likeable and the story is great. So glad they came out with a combo pack. Now I get the Blu-ray for me and the DVD for my daughter. Win Win!!
2,It could have been better!,"You expect a certain kitschy approach to American animation: the sight jokes,contemporary wordplay and overwrought effort to endear its hero or heroine to the audience. But this DVD was disappointing! The topic of French cooking and culinary art offers a field day for creative animation which the producers of this so-so effort failed to grasp. At least there was one attempt to educate the public regarding the chef, sous chef, line cook, and their duties. The plot was too simplistic and the heavy-handed attempt to inject menace through the accepted belief in the nature of rats as thieves killed the hero rat chef's well-meaning naivete."
5,"Great movie for young and ""old-er""","My husband and I are both 68 years old, and watched this at the encouragment of our brother-in-law who is in his late 70's. Glad we did. It is so fresh and well scripted, well animated, well everything! We bought the DVD to have on hand for our grandchildren (ha ha) but have watched it 2 or more times ourselves....which is rare for a hubby that doesn't watch anything twice. (I take that back, he watched ""Sleepless in Seatle"" 3 times.) I on the other hand, watch until I know all the ""lines""."
5,The best,this is very education tool and everybody should get their child or teen for school or something educational.
2,"Works well, but hard to justify the price","I got my Cobb as a gift and have used it four times in a week. It's handled a pork loin, chicken pieces, some random vegetables and a tray of hamburgers with no problems--but I'd expect that from any $19.95 cheapie grill, too. I like the Cobb, but it's really hard to justify the price on this thing, particularly for the accessories. I'm glad to have it, but I doubt I'd buy it."
5,Swingline Paper Trimmer,Great price on namebrand dependable product have used on many different projects where durability is a must been using on regular basis. So far no downside works great from cutting coupons to wood veneer. Etremely satisfied!!!!
1,"Trimmer defective, Swingline/ACCO customer service nonexistent","I purchased this trimmer for personal, light duty use in a school setting. The trimmer cuts nicely, but the problem was with one of the feet, which fell off and disappeared a few weeks after I received the trimmer. I had to shim the bottom to use the trimmer without it rocking back and forth. I contacted Swingline/Acco and simply asked them to send me a replacement foot. Their response was that they do not have these parts available, and the rep suggested that I go to a hardware or home improvement store and buy some ""bump-its"" or levelling things. I was appalled that they expected me to spend more money fixing their defective product. Since the foot fell off after Amazon's return window had expired, I now have to eat the cost of returning the trimmer. Buyer beware of this one."
3,Product has slight defect,"The product is well designed, but the one I received has a minor dent on the blade, causing not so perfect cutting. It is not effort and cost effective to return it, so I just kept it. Not quite happy."
2,"Decent, but not great.","It's ok if you want to trim off some excess. But you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut. There is no guide, so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming.I'm really disappointed in that if I cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces, it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade. I don't like that at all."
1,NOT SQUARE,"I needed to replace a paper cutter which lasted 25+ years. I should have read the three star review which mention it doesn't cut straight. This is a nice looking and heavy made paper cutter. My first problem was it's top heavy, when you lift the cutting arm it the whole paper cutter tips back. So you have to hold the front bed of the paper cutter down as you lift the arm. Ok but it does cut so no deal breaker . After using for a few days I notice it wasn't cutting square. I stuck a metal square on it and the top edge where you place the edge of the paper against isn't even straight. The top edge has a bow in it at the 2 inch mark. Placing the metal square its off 3/16 of an inch across the 12"" top edge. Another poorly made in China to Swingline specifications piece of of junk.. No quality control. Returning right now.."
4,Mob Madness,"This movie is about the rise of mobster Sam Gravano, whose testimony put John Gotti and others in jail. Some may find this movie too long. I thought the nearly three-hour length allowed the story to develop more fully. The story drew me in. The film raises the question of what is ethical. According to this movie, it depends upon one's point of reference. The mob has its own code of ethics. Gravano is depicted as striving to live according to that code. It is a code that jusifies murder. This film has plenty of executions but I did not think the violence was overdone. This movie draws the viewer into the mad world of the mob. We are enticed to see Gravano, who murdered 19 people, as an honorable hero. This view is questioned at the end, however, when we begin to emerge from the darkness of the crime world and see the cost of crime to all of us."
2,Non-Enhanced Bass Earbuds,"Although other reviewers ""rave"" about these earbuds, I, unfortunately, did not like the sound quality at all. There really is no bass enhancement and the overall sound was not crisp and clear...sort of muffled and lacking volume. Maybe I got a defective pair or, as another reviewer stated, ""It's like they have tried to make a cheaper product..."" It looks like the most favorable reviews are from 2009. Okay, these are only 10-20 bucks but, for the same money, I have found others (e.g. Skullcandy) to have very good sound and be an outstanding value."
1,Don't buy this book,"I couldn't even finish this book it was so bad. I was looking for an in-depth view of someone's experiences at MBA school. Instead, it was a novel so loosely based on fact that it's gives you a totally inaccurate view of the MBA. It states that Tuck gets 10,000+ applications for 200 places and this is false. It states that the Harvard MBA is offered in an 18 month accelerated format starting in January. This is totally false.Judged as a purely fictional account bearing no resemblance to reality and judged as a work of fantasy, it also falls terribly short. It's written in the oh-my-gosh-as-if style that you would expect from a 15 year old girl circa the mid 1990's and is so annoying that it's difficult to read. It's painful reading this book."
3,Eleven Minutes,This is the frist book from Paulo Coelho I have ever read and it entertain me a lot the way he writes is very interesting but to me this book is too much about sex.
3,Unexpected from Coelho,"This novel is different from the former works of Coelho. His books so far have been easily read, tale like self-help books. In his new novel, his writing style is still quite simple, almost in spoken language however he chooses to be explicit and graphic to create the intensity of scenes. He tries to be provocative and tries to enter a territory he has not before. The subject is serious and sometimes disturbing but he chooses to make it a tale and end it as a tale again, therefore weakens his plot."
2,Trite and not believable,"It is a steamy romance, and the author is trying to use it as a vehicle for an exploration into sex, love, and desire. I did not believe that a 23 year old girl from the countryside of Brazil could have gained such wisdom and insight and be applying it to her life."
3,Expected More,"For a fairly expensive space heater that promises ""infrared"" techonolgy, I kind of thought I was going to be toasted from head to toe. It claims it heats solid objects - not the air. True, but it heats only directly in front of the heater. It has no range, or radius around the heater itself. Thus, if you are sitting in a deck chair smoking a cigar on your porch during a northest winter (which is why I bought the item), your legs will be toasty, but from the waist up you're still freezing. It needs to be coupled with the same type of item suspended from some fixture to warm your upper body."
1,Shockingly mediocre ....,"I have been an ardent L.Subramaniam fan for over 20 years, never missing his concert should it happen in my home town. His ""Super Instinct"", ""INDIA 2000"" & ""Conversations"" have sent me into raptures. I still believe he is one of the most talented violinists in the world. Having said all that, the mediocrity of this album is SHOCKING, to the say the least. This sounds like fusion for fusion's sake. The different instruments and melodies just don't blend well. Parts of this album are downright cacophonic. Listening to this album is akin to eating vanilla ice-cream topped with chopped garlic. Recycling is good for the environment, but someone should tell L.Subramaniam that recycling music is not only boring, but is also unethical. He should make a living from now on by just giving classical concerts (which he is very good at) and not disappoint his fans by creating junk like this. What a waste of money !!"
5,"A Masterpiece, It moves you beyon the realm of senses","L. Subramanian plays the violin in a sitting position -- as it appears from the CD Jacket. Yet his music levitates you beyond your physical senses. Words cannot describe the sensation but the music will. A great ensemble of great masters from around the world, thus the title ""Global Fusion"". This CD is by far one of the best around. If you like music, you love this CD."
3,"An ""ok"" Christmas album",This album was not as good as I'd hoped it would be. The piano playing is fine; guess it's just the arrangements I wasn't real excited about!
5,Get this one for your holiday enjoyment!,More friends purchased this CD after listening to mine. Ms Adair's arrangements are a cut above the typical Christmas CDs. It's hard to choose a favorite...they are all that good!
2,Nothing Special,"This is simply a regular brush, it does not help with tangles at all. For a real tangle friendly brush get this one... The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (you don't have to use it in the shower obviously) - this works on all 3 of my kids - all agree that it does not hurt and one has straight, medium length thick hair, one has super long, curly hair and the other had thinner long hair."
5,French made hair brush,"This is the second one of these brushes I have given my wife, she loves them. They last about 7 years. The best thing about them though is that they're made in France. How many things do you have in your house that aren't made in China. Michael Trusty"
3,Not for blow drying.,I was fairly happy with this brush until I went on vacation and forgot my ceramic round brush I use for drying my hair. After two times of drying my hair for 10 minutes the bristles bent so much it rendered the brush useless.
5,This is the best book I have read in ages!!,"This is the wittiest, most clever, most hilarious ""relationship"" book I have ever read. In addition to the hysterical British humor, the he said/she said alternating chapters provide a great point/counter point of how each character feels about the same situation. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
4,a light and easy summer read that i definitely reccomend!,"i read this book second time around this summer, and fell in love with it again. its great to read a book that has both side, but actually written by a male and a female, and not by one author trying to figure out how each sex would react. for someone that is into a deep and heavy read then its not for you, i think its a light hearted read and one that will make u smile, and relate to yourself."
4,"Come together, Lushly","Im 17 years only, and i am very picky about the books that i enjoy. But 'Come Together' was a great book, i couldn't put it down.I have read 3 books by these author's and i have found that each book is just as good as the last.The story line was basic yet it had a flow that made it very interesting, and in some places i was cracking up, as there is quite a bit of humor in the book.A great book, well worth reading!!"
5,Truly Laugh-Out-Loud,"I thought this book was a gem!So what if it isn't a great piece of literature. It had all I want in a book to brighten up a monotonous day - it was fun, funny, entertaining and had great witty dialogue. Somehow, the English truly have the dry wit market cornered. All the reviews I have read here are spot-on! My only lament was that it ended when it did. I so-oo wanted to know what happened next....did they walk down the aisle? would Matt and H click? Amy's job is just peachy...how did it turn out for Jack??? Sigh!...Hmmm....heard a sequel's out..lemme go check."
4,Beautiful Book!,"For readers with one or more Dachshunds around the house, you'll love the beautiful artwork of David Hockney and I'll bet these poses will look all too familiar. They certainly did to me! The variety of medium and presentation make this an interesting work for the artistically inclined as well."
5,Preliminary Thoughts,"I have yet to purchase this album but the title says exactly what I've been hoping to hear. Leo, if you're out there: you're a great, great guitar player, one of the very best. Please ditch any thought of accompaniment in the future (drums, synthesizer, whatever). These only dilute and distract. You understimate your voice however. Keep on singing."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a very clean sound, that I wold use in the background during consultations or by myself. It was more intense then that in most places. I felt if the artist had tried to accomplish a little less technically, it would have been easier on the ear."
2,waste of 600 perfectly good pages,"This book is not worth the time it took to read it. In the beginning you think Angela would end up with the supposed ""hero"", when that's not it at all. There are several times when Angela steps out of character. And in some instances when you deffinitly know that a man wrote this book. Even the time table was messed up. People in regency England did not give the finger, and tell people to go to ****. The only good thing about this book that was good was that you could really get into the story. And there were a few very funny scences."
1,CTW should be ashamed!,"My 4 year old twin boys were able to complete the entire game (only 8 poorly designed levels) in about 5 minutes. The graphics are poor and the game play is lame, even for a 4 year old. Children's TV Workshop should refund everyones money as its not worth $35. What were they thinking? Stick with a full featured game such as Mario Bro."
1,Violent! too much!!!,"There is nothing special about this book! All the entire thing of dragon ball z is about is violence! I, as a kid my self, think it is far too violent! If you get this book for anyone, do not get it for young readers. It is a very bad example! And a total waste of money!"
4,watch is really good,I really liked alot..it was a present to my fiance and he liked it very much..thnx
2,item discontenued buy the mk2 or the mix up will cost you 50$,"i initialy ordered the novation 25 SL2 because that one was more $$ thinking it was the better one, but it was dicontenued so they sent me the mk2 which amazon had listed for about 50$$ less than 399.99$$ i thought instead of sending it back and reperchusing the mk2 they would just reinbers me the difrance and call it that. but neither amazon or anyone stood up and took responsability for the price difrance. they should at least be on the same page but their are not but they kude at least take down the add, but havent yet. its my understanding that amazon should not be selling either of these items for the price that they are listed when in fact is false. so just beware and buy the mk2 or you gona loose 50$ like i did..."
4,Awesome,"I got this for my mandolin. I was pleasantly surprised how amazing the quality of the sound so i experimented. Works just as great on my mandolin as it does on my Dreadnought, Classical and Violin. It is a bit of a feedback whore with distortion. Your volume and tone adjustments are by placement near the bridge. Treble, Full Tone, Bass. I would have given this 5 stars but there is not a volume adjustment as far as a switch."
1,"cheap materials,terribly inferior hinges broke after 2 hours","I am very disappointd in this expensive ,higher end cd payer.The hinges on the lid are terribly inferior and broke after less than 2 hours of playing time.The store,stereo advantage would not return my money or the purchase allow me to apply the purchase amont toward a different cd player.The store people were rude and uncooperative.Sony customer service rp at the 800 number was more understanding but referred me back to the store and said it was their decision. the store in Buffalo area does big bussiness.They left me with the comment that I might get a new lid after they checked again with sony but thats all.UI showed all my receipts....Im angry"
2,Sony really dissapointed me!,"First, the Esp function, I've thought it would be really good, and the thing skips with every cd-r I put on it, even if it doesn't have any scratch (even Sony Cd-r's) and the plastic, it seems cheap and bad quality and the price is too high for what it is, and it is made in Malaysia! I've spected something much better from an such remarkable company as Sony, I remembered the times when they did stuff at Japan, and USA, now even the cd-r media and the batteries are made in Indonesia, if Sony continues manufacturing their electronic devices in those countries they will loose costumers"
4,Excellent Read,I have found it so interesting. I have a feeling that many of the things you write about are probably really happening even right now. I can not even begin to understand what war is like but thank you for putting it in such a language that I might understand a snapshot of what is really going on in our world.
3,Sold at yard sale,"This product will help you get abs IF YOU USE IT. I did use it, but it wasn't more effective than other FREE exercises like running or doing crunches. Over time, I stopped using it because it is just another piece of equipment to set up/put away/look at. I think I got 5 bucks for it at a yard sale."
5,Nice Exercise Thing!!!,"Nice place to exercise in!! My parents bought this to exercise b/c we were fat. So, I use it sometimes to get rid of it. And worked. Hey, Did I say what happened to my cousin at my uncle's house, He exercised and bent it and It broked. I laughed so hard. I know. Buy it!! Never let a kid use it. I just forgot to put Recommendation. Electric Bird Out!!!!"
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"At a sporting goods store last night, I had the pleasure of trying out the latest version of this money making contraption: Ab Lounge Ultra. It didn't exercise my abdominal muscles at all. In fact, it practically folds up by itself when you sit in it . . . doing the sit up for you! It really saddens me to see marketers take advantage of people's desire for health and happiness."
3,Sounds fine - but watch the mounting depth for your application,Bought these speakers for my boat. They required a slightly larger mounting hole-and after cutting found out they are also too deep for my boat.Will use in my truck and get a different style/company for my boat
2,"Slow shipper, look elsewhere","I ordered 2 sets of speakers over a week ago. The ship date from Amazon said ""The 7th"", It is now the 8th and still no shipment of my speakers. I wish I would of just used Overtons."
5,speakers,i bought these under used they worked prefect the only thing they were not in origanal package but they were perfect and the were half price. I bought 2 sets
3,speakers,"The product is still in the box since it would not fit in the existing speaker hole. It's a good looking speaker, but it seems to be on steroids or a bit too large for a quick remove and install of old speakers. Make sure you measure correctly before ordering."
4,Very enjoyable CD!,"I enjoyed sharing these songs with my kids (ages 10, 10, and 5). I have fond memories of playing my dad's old Johnny Cash record of funny songs when I was a kid. I do wish ""Egg Suckin' Dog"" had been on this one, though."
2,Eventually disappointed.,"I bought this product a little under 2 years ago. I used it infrequently for the first year and frequently after that. A couple days ago it just would not work (the screen would not come down). I contacted Optoma for assistance. They explained that the product only has a 1 year warranty (information I could not find anywhere on my own) and said it would cost more to ship and repair the screen than it would to simply buy a new one. I asked if I could get parts to fix it myself and they said they do not sell replacement parts. So after two years, I am just out. It was a good product while it lasted, but in my opinion it should have lasted a whole lot longer."
5,Effective Teaching and Learning!,"This is an EXCELLENT book! If you are familiar with the MBTI it will be very helpful. If not, it may be a bit overwheliming. It is in detail and the authors give practical uses of the information. It is presented in a very factual, tell it like it is form. If you have liked ""Please Understand Me"" and other MBTI type books, you will like this. Well layed out, but more charts would have been useful to compare and contrast the different styles quickly. Have already used the information for a quick start with a difficult charter school class. Great Buy! Worth the money!"
1,Anthology of garbage,"Sorry to tell ya readers out there, but I have more Christian Death paraphernalia than you. Sorry, I win. That said, the ONLY thing selling these CDs these days is the name. The content went to crap long ago. But to keep up my collection I have continued to purchase anything with the Christian Death moniker, Rozz Williams, Shadow Project, Premature Ejaculation, Pompeii 99... List goes on. But alas, I will never purchase another piece of Valors attempt at what he calls music."
2,SUBTITLES,"Ok, first off... I have seen bits of this movie before and was finally sold when I saw the song ""Dholi Taro Dhol Baaje"" video on Youtube. So I ordered the DVD and when I sat down to watch the DVD... THE SUBTITLES WERE WAAAAAAY OFF. Lyrics from songs overlapped with the characters lines, the subtitles gave away the punch line before the characters said them or the dramatic music marked them... Its so sad, I've read others reviews about the DVD and everyone seems fine with their copy, did I get a defect? Well, maybe amazon can help me out with it..."
2,Feynman Processor,"Gerard's book, is somewhat aimed at an audience well above its actual content. Its slightly advanced setting is probably better placed in a higher level forum than that of a popular science text."
2,Boring!,"It is a really good concept for a book - two boys spending the summer in Japan and if some of the ideas had been expanded, Crossing Pacific could have been a very interesting book. But instead it just skims over the surface, with no details to really interest the reader. There are no conflicts between Lincoln and his host family - they manage to speak impecable English. He teaches them American slang and practices kempo. There is no development of Mitsuo's interest in baseball or how they can all speak English so well. It might be interesting for younger students looking for a quick read, but if you want more details about a summer spent in Japan, look elsewhere!"
3,An okay book,"Egdar Carson has come home from the trenches to find himself unable to find work. But his wife Opal is a fighter for her family and she wants more for her family. Soon Opal finds herself riding the wave of sucess but Edgar this means more pain and bitterness.I got ""Opal"" by Elvi Rhodes after reading ""The Bright One"" but I have to say that I didn't like it very much. In a way that I thought that Opal was blind her husband needs and happiness and how she thougth that money would change everything. Overall ""Opal"" was not as good as some of Elvi Rhodes books that I have read."
3,"Over priced when sold new, but fair price now on Amazon","This was my first GPS and I found it pretty easy to learn how to use.I purchased it primarly to use on my motorcycle, but I enjoy it in my car too. I did a lot of shopping around comparing all models that were waterproof for use on motorcycles & I thought this one was the best value with it's features for around $250.00. It has blue tooth that I can sinc to my iPhone and a blue tooth ear piece so you can hear the directions from the ear piece. Overall I'd say this is a good unit. I wish they included more features that are common on cheaper units like find me, and garmin garage, and more memory for mp3s. I think this will meet the needsof most users."
3,"Bulky, too much $$ for the size","Overall performance was great on this unit. I took 3 units for a 30 day trial run, this was the first one. The unit did everyrthing it was supposed to do flawlessly. The points of interest catagories by Garmin are superior they give you full address and phone number. It came in handy on Hawaii when we wanted ice cream and it was 10pm, we looked up Bakin Robins and called them phone number to find out they were open for another hour, deifinately a time saver.Downside, it is not portable. There is no easy way of carrying this unit around, you can't use it at your desk because there is no battery like the c550 unit. The bean bag design leaves a lot to be desired. For the price I would check into the C550 or the tomtom 910. I ended up with the Tomtom after 3 months of comparison, more bang for the high price buck. see my detailed comarison on either C550 or the Tomtom 910"
4,"4,5 stars Their best album",This is their best album and an album that i recommend anyone who likes rock and hard rock to buy. Its cool easy - listening with the right balance between adrenaline and calm. Amazing songs vocals production - generally the rhythm the tempo and the atmosphere is fantastic.
3,Cult Status,"I remember being quite impressed by this album at the time of its release; since then I can't help but feel that it was a good band's last hurrah.The chops are there; hellacious production by Bob Rock (possibly his best ever), great riffs by Billy Duffy, and Astbury's delivery is never found wanting (check out ""Fire Woman"",""Sun King"", ""New York City"", and the Kashmir-eque ""Soul Asylum""), but at other times, the lyrics and performance are the worst kind of self-parody since every single hair-band in the eighties got their day.Much better than the follow-up ""Ceremony"", but the last decent gasp from a derivative band with heart."
4,Good Movie,"I am no Hindustani, but this is one hell of a good movie. It has a very well defined storyline, and most importantly, it could really touch you."
3,South Pacific Island Adventure!!,Enjoy a high seas adventure in the South Pacific. Pirates and islanders with Jon Hall as the good guy and Peter Lorre as a bad guy.
5,Transported to another world..,"This Cd with it's heavy bass lines and exquisite surprises tucked mid-way within each song, is one of my favorites. The first 3 songs are AWESOME. Many others are notable. Track #8 ""Selfish Tendencies"" is raw. I was so excited when I got the Cd (at work) that I ran down to the parking lot to listen to it in my car. When the CD ended, I had to ""shake it off"" because I was in the zone. You feel like you've stepped into someone else's life - and that's what makes her music so special. This Cd is chill, unique and unlike your typical ""never hear from them again neo-soulers"". If you like complex beats, tight bass lines, a unique voice and lyrics that twist and turn - then this CD is for you. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Mostly at Night ----when I'm asleep,I bought this on a whim. I should have listened to it first.The production sucks and she could have a great voice for the Lion King or some Broadway musical.
5,Good series,"I am satisfied, just wish the books can come out faster. The characters come off real, you feel their emotions. Jude Watson is a great writer, look forward to the nexy book!"
2,SOULESS..save your $$$$,"i'm sorry but this game is so lame, it makes fighting force 2 look like METAL GEAR. this is what happens when programmers rush a game in time for the holidays. let's see...poor character design, dark & dull graphics, a corny repetitive soundtrack and not to mention the lame ass sean connery impersonation..(""GO!"")I HAD WAY MORE FUN PLAYING GAURDIAN HEROES for the defunct SEGA SATURN than this 128 bit mess. if sega releases more crap like SOUL FIGHTER, the DC may die a horrible death, just in time for sony's playstation 2. but luckly that is not the case, cause RE; CODE VERONICA, LEGACY OF KAIN, CARRIER & ZOMBIE REVENGE is on it's way. THANK GOD!avoid this game at any cost, at least it makes a great coaster or even a mini frisbee.."
4,Corner Ladder Stabilizer,The Crawford-Lehigh LSC corner ladder stabilizer is what I needed for accessing difficult places on my house. All the parts were in good condition. I had a little difficult installing the end protection as the sharp aluminum edges caught on the horizontal ridges. I solved that by putting the end protection into hot water and then was able to get it on as required. This product also helps me access the roof without placing the ladder against the gutters.
2,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA,"well im gonna start of by saying something nice.the music is kinda ok....BUT THE REST STINKS!!!!!the vocals are a disgrace to hardcore music.they sound like a punk like scream.i have nothing against punk music its just these guys label themselves as hardcore.but in my oppinion these guys are anything but hardcore,more like""cheese core""If you like bands like 90 pound wuss u ought to like these guys.but if it comes down to what i think....THIS ALBUM BLOWS VELVETA"
5,Best present under the tree!,"We bought this for our 6 & 8 year old boys. I put it together after they went to sleep - they are still a little young to do the construction - it took about 2 hours. It wasn't hard, but there are just so many pieces that it takes a while.The kids have been entranced with it! They have spent hours watching it - trying to figure out all the slides, funnel, lifter, etc. They love it when an occasional marble escapes and they get to reintroduce it. Ours came with 10 marbles.If your child is into things like gears and marbles, this is a fantastic toy - my kids sure love it!"
3,complicated toy,"I bought this for my son because he loves marbles. It took my husband hours to put together and then it kept falling apart. It had to be readjusted constantly to keep the marbles running smoothly. Also, it states in the manual that we can go to the website to get more construction ideas but the website as been down for months! Where is the accountability to customers when we cannot even contact the makers of this toy?For the price of this toy, I wish I had gotten something different; something more user friendly."
2,Crap Toy -- Don't Buy,"This toy is total junk. It falls apart constantly. It takes the better part of a day to assemble with an adult on hand, then it falls every 5 minutes when it is working. Terribly disappointing toy."
2,"A few good songs, but no cigar","""Now the News"" has good lyrics, bad music... ""Pilgrim song""..good lyrics, bad music...""Do What you Said""...ok lyrics, horrible music.All the songs sound the same. Pass on this album. If you want, just go look up the words, the music does nothing but ruin them, when they are decent.If you look at most of eLi's reviews, people give his albums 5 stars because of his personality, or because they know him and he's such a swell guy. First of all, he's not, and second of all, if they were honestly grading these albums on their merit alone they could not in good conscious give these albums 5 stars.The music is horribly simplistic to the point of insanity. If you've heard one eli song, you've heard them all."
5,JUST A BEAUTIFUL COLLECTION,"PROBABLY MY FAVORITE COLLECTION OF COOL, RELAXING SONGS BY A GREAT ARTIST"
3,Those damn vocals!!,"Here we have a heavier than hell band in the Sleep/Cathedral vein (who play GREEN Matamp amps by the way...which crush!), but the vocals are unfortunately in the Napalm Death/Morbid Angel mold of guttural growls, which ruins everything. Unless of course you're into that sort of thing."
2,Not Quite What I Imagined,"While some of the ""lessons"" in the book were good, about 60% were not quite the ideal behavior I want from my daughters. (i.e. A princess never plays with a toy more than once.) They really should charge $5000 for the book, as it seems designed for wealthy princesses - not just any princess."
2,Very brief Pamphlet,"Technically there are 24 pages in this paperback. This includes fairly large print and pages partially filled. It also includes review pages and ""practice pages"" with just a couple sentences of instruction with blank lines for you to fill in."
4,Aspect ratios will not allow frame to fill without distortion,"The two aspect ratios programmed into this frame (16:9, 4:3) are not appropriate for the size of the frame. Neither of them allows the image to fill the frame without distortion. It would be nice if the manufacturer would add an additional choice of 'fill frame' to the list. Other than that it is a nice little frame. Just know that you will have black borders on two sides or distortion of your image."
4,"Great for the price! Few ""VERY"" minor flaws.","I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a good addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7"" frame. This one is just right for my wallet."
4,Mustek PF-A700B 7-Inch Digital Picture Frame,Transaction was great but product was not high quality We compared it to another digital picture frame that was $30 more and it was like a comparison between the Dollar Store and Macy's. Pay the extra money for the quality....it makes a total difference.Thanks!
2,Photo & Mp3 Player,"While this unit does display digital photos and play mp3 files, it doesn't do it at the same time. You can either look at photos or listen to music. Not much point in that as the speakers are tinny and poor sounding so you would never use it as a stand alone music player. It would be okay for background music while you look at photos, which is what I assumed it would do before I purchased it. But it doesn't."
1,Sent it right Back,Not even close to what i thought i was getting... The instructions that came with it were not helpful in the least .. They only explain where things are on the menu not how to use the actual product. A waste of money and time...
5,Tomorrow Today Wow!,"If you've ever been in a deep relationship, then the first two tracks will let you journey back to some of your most romantic feelings. Can't stop the feet from moving with the rhythmic beat in the song Tomorrow Today."
1,Warranty and customer support,"I purchased this camcorder 8 months ago, 2 months ago I experienced snow flake effect when recording, I called Samsung to repair it they referred me to a local dealer the dealer was not able to fix it so I called Samsung again they asked me to ship it to NJ, for repair so I did, with charge for service repair and the cost of shipping I accrued from a lack of qualified Service centers locally. They have been holding my camcorder for one and half months. I have called them several times and even talked to the manager but I can not get a answer as to when I will get it back or other wise."
1,Pay no attention to the previous review.,"Speaking as a bassoonist, I can say that Daniel Smith truly has the absolute worst sound I have ever heard. In fact, he is held in an extremely low regard by bassoonists in general.Dear reader, all I ask is that you wander Amazon and sample the recordings of Dag Jensen, Knut Sönstevold, Bernard Garfield, Frank Morelli, Klaus Thunemann, and Milan Turkovic to hear examples of a truly excellent bassoon sound.In fact, Tamás Benkócs is currently at volume two of a complete set of Vivaldi concerti. Go sample those as well.Listen to just one sample of these bassoonists or listen to as many as you can. Then come back here and sample these, and tell me if you are truly willing to waste so much as a penny on this garbage."
2,There was no need for this book,Mr Saprandeo does not have a formal University experince. This chip on the shoulder is evident throughout the book. He deludes himself to be an economist. He has read 2500 books( See his interview in the Market Wizard book. But you need formal education to understand economics. There are somethings in life which a virgin cannot appreciate.The part 2 has some useful parts but you could get them in his first book. The profitable section is on drawing the tendline and the 1 2 3 method and the 2-B. Actually the 2-B indicator is nothing but a spike reversal pattern . The most unscientific part was the market life expectency. How can he explain this bull market?In all fareness I liked his FIRST book. I saved myself a lot of losses by knowing when the trend was about to change. SO read his first book and save your money on part-2
2,This book is out of date!,"I purchased this book based on the reviews which I usually trust.This book is way out of date, this type of scripting has been well super-seded by Windows Scripting Host, or even Kix scripting. These languages are far more logical to learn and trouble shoot then ""if %t:=01"" style of language. To be honest, the photo on the book cover sums the book up, a photo from the 40's of a guy oiling a turtle! dated!"
3,Fair offering,"The start of the CD comes off heavy, fast and hard. Good riffs and interesting tunes make it highly enjoyable. However, I notice that as the CD goes on, it gets fairly boring and forgetable. Not as good as their first album, it does please and is a worthy offering for Slaughter and 80's anthem metal style fans."
1,Doesn't work for Gameboy Color,"The plug I received didn't fit in the hole for the Gameboy Color's AC Adapter. It fits in the headphone jack, which is, of course, pointless.The plastic was also non-transparent grey instead of like in the picture, indicating that it may not have been the same kind of ac adapter. It's possible that it was just the particular seller I purchased the adapter from selling the wrong item."
1,BEWARE,I don't know what this AC adapter is supposed to be for but it's not for a Gamebow. I have a classic gameboy and this does not fit in any jack on my Gameboy.
3,it's ok. expected better,"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i dont use it.- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you dont see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.i'd buy it again."
1,Stopping the blitz? Overated.,"As a highly successful college coach, I have discovered that it's really not necessary to scheme against the blitz. Really, if one executes the gameplan that one scripts several months before the game, there is no need to adjust.Screens and quick slants are dangerous plays to run. The best way to beat the blitz is to keep the QB stationary, so that he is able to execute the keen gameplan of 3 yard outs.Another good way to beat the blitz is to have the receivers run very long, complicated hitch patterns that will confuse the DB.Besides that, there is no need to bring in extra blockes, audible, misdirect, tunnel screen, flare, quick slant, rollout, or do anything else.I believe that my astounding record of wins per season stands as a testiment to my ability."
1,Poor mixer,"Very disappointed with this Hamilton Beach ""mixer"". It does not have the power or blade to mix ice cream shakes as advertised. A spoon does a better job."
5,Best Game Ever! Lots of Fun!,This is the best game ever! We play with our friends and laugh for hours!
4,Dovorak softer side,"Unlike many of Dovorak's works these works are quieter and softer and yet still they have the nervous energy that most of his pieces do. I honestly thought that these works would be boring, but I was wrong. I really liked the CD. It had many charming and nice sections and also many faster paced lively secions. Anybody will enjoy the CD. I bet even people who don't like classical music will like this CD."
2,BUYER BEWARE! READ THE SMALL PRINT AND REVIEWS,"Because REGION 2 was not printed in bold lettering at the top, as I've seen on other advertisements I purchased this... by mistake. I should have read the small print at the bottom. I will in the future. The good news is that much of this great stuff can be found on other dvds playable in the good ol usa."
2,So-So,"I thought this would have more comedy in it. They follow 5 ventriloquist varying from someone who has ""made it"" and a 13 year old kid starting out on his journey to becoming a professional. Unfortunately, I found myself fast-forwarding through it just to see the professional Terry Fator. As a documentary it just is not that interesting. Disappointing."
2,Dumb,I did not really enjoy this movie----thought it was soemthing completely different. Not worth the watch...sorry to say. Don't waste your time or your money...I am sorry i did.
1,This Product Failed My Review,"The Mad Catz Light And Magnifier for GameBoy Color failed in my opinion. After i bought the product none of the lights would work. I bought 5 different brands of AAA batteries and none of the lights worked, I even exchanged my product for a new Light And Magnifier, but the lights STILL DID NOT WORK. The magnifier was great, and i was happy with that part of the product. The only reason i didn't like it was because the LIGHTS DID NOT WORK. Other than that the product is great. Now i have decided to go with another brand. if it is better i will let everyone know."
3,eh???,"when using this product it's very bulky and it has a glare when another light source comes in contact with it, and its very hard to talk off once on.overall good product for the price"
4,Great for 6 bucks,"This product is VERY handy when its dark,or you have bad vision.It snaps onto the ridges on the top part of any gameboy color.it takes 2 AAA batteries.Once you snap it on the top part folds out and then it folds out again.to turn the light on there is a little switch on the left side of the battery compartment.the magnifying glass works really well."
1,Mislabeled - Not a Rectal Syringe,"As other reviewers have noted, this is not a rectal syringe, which would have a smooth nozzle. These nozzles are shaped like vaginal douche syringes. I don't know how they would work for that, but they certainly won't work well as rectal syringes because of their ribbed shape. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the reviewers who pointed this out. I wish I had saved my money. The best rectal syringe I've found is an emptied out Fleets bottle. They last a while, and then you throw them away and get another one. They're super cheap and available everywhere. Even cheaper online. Don't buy this. You won't like it."
5,Lost Classic Album,"10 years ago when the album was released it only sold 300,000 copies and didn't make it to the top 200. However it was a strong album with great legendary songs such as ""power to the music"", uncle jack, 'death do us apart' and a few others. The new singer John Corabi has a voice that sounds like a combination of James Hetfield (Metallica) and Steve tyler (Aerosmith).In my opinion this is the best album done by Motley Crue along with Dr Feelgood, and John Corabi is a better singer than Vince Neil because his voice isn't so high and the songs have more realistic down to earth sounds. It was a great shame that the band took him for granted and sacked him. Some of the songs have similar sounds like The Great Southern Trendkill (Pantera), Soundgarden and the latest Metallica albums. If you like all these bands that I have mentioned and other heavy metal and grunge bands of the 90's and now you'll like this one. Go and buy it. You won't regret it."
2,NOT Crue.......,"BUT hear me out.As a motley album,it sucked.But take the motley name off of this cd and it is a brilliant effort!Had they not used the motley name and used something else,this cd would've done much better i believe.The songwriting blew me away.And the songs just drill you in the face!""Power to the music"",is killer,""smoke the sky""is powerful!The whole cd is hard rock at it's finest.BUT alas,under the motley moniker doomed it to failure.SO great Corabi effort,hold yer head up high John,a killer,memorable album,be proud! Bottom line Crue rating:2 Corabi& band:5 stars!"
4,Straight-forward and Easy to Read,"With a series of concise essays that are penetrating and remarkably to-the-point, Krishnamurti presents the reader with a many-sided exploration of spirituality, morality, ethics, religion, and belief."
2,Not impressed,"This CD shows that a rift was coming. Much Like Floyd and the Final Cut. Yes, it is good to hear Styx again, I wish they had waited until the rift was over. I saw them after Dennis was gone and have to say they were re-born. I would skip this one and try Cyclorama."
2,"I Hate To Say It, But I Think Styx' Time Has Passed","I have been a longtime fan of Styx and was happy to hear that the four surviving members of the ""classic"" lineup were putting together a CD of entirely new material for the first time in over 15 years.I had ""Great Expectations"" (a track on the CD), but they were hardly met. I feel like it is a compilation of three solo albums (Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young) instead of a group effort. DeYoung peppers the CD with mostly sappy ballads again, which has become his Styx trademark since the success of Babe in the late 70s. I think Tommy Shaw's work is the most disappointing because he has nothing memorable on this CD, the first time that has ever happened IMHO. I wondered if he used songs that didn't make the cut on his solo CD last year. And James Young's tunes are louder filler, which has usually been the case during Styx' career.So as a 20+ year fan of the group (since Grand Illusion), I hate to say it, but they shouldn't have bothered."
1,REALLY bad,"After having listened to and having enjoyed my father's copies of Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight, I decided to start buying more of Styx's cd's. Needless to say I've been disappointed with each additional purchase, but Brave New World is, quite possibly, the worst cd I've ever owned. Even Dennis DeYoung, in an interview, said he cried when he listened to Tommy's contributions. Yes, they are THAT bad. I agree with Dennis but I'd like to add that I also cried when I listened to his dreck like Fallen Angel and High Crimes (Hip Hop Cracy). Yuck. Bottom of the barrel, which is sad considering this guy owns a still-amazing set of pipes tailor-made for belting out rock songs (like the immortal Queen of Spades). There are two decent songs here, Everything is Cool and While There's Still Time, which would have been a hit twenty years ago when this band still mattered. Everything else is not cool. It's really, really bad."
5,Brave New World almost Gold,"Hard to believe with the lack of effort by CMC to promote this CD, but even without it BNW is almost Gold and well deserved. This is a great CD which features some incredible music arrangements by the best in the business. Dennis De Young can still sing like nobody else and Tommy Shaw showes us how much of a range others in the Rock and Roll insustry wish they had. J.Y. Can still rip on Guitar and Todd is one of the best new drummers to the business. BNW gets 5 stars from me and a ""Thank You to STYX for giving the fans something new. We love you!"
4,Transition is Odd,"I love Diana Palmer books. This book is no exception. I loved it, but the transition from Jordan being cruel to Jordan being sweet and sorry was a little rushed. The story line was great, but that one small part was rushed and kind of made the story predictable. I still recommend reading it."
5,One of my favorites!,"This book has got to be one of my favorites by Diana Palmer. It's great...it has all the right components to make it a great story. Libby is strong...she handles the death of her father, the torment of her enemy, and the torture of her stepmother very well. I believe she's one of the strongest characters from Diana Palmer's books. Jordan Powell is simply great....although he does get blinded by a woman, its natural...at least it is realistic about what sometimes happens in real life. Jordan is very masculine and very passionate...one of the sweetest chracters as well..it has enough passion, action, and tenderness...overall this book is one of the best by far!"
2,Good stuff; some errors; poor index and organization,"Lots of good stuff here collected from the discussions on author's Website forum. Found some errors in the content and some basic English errors that made me less trusting about the accuracy. Tone not bothersome to me.The killer is the poor index. Lots of good stuff I found in the book that I could not find in the index. Related topics are scattered around. Light weight and compact size. Yucky cover.I bought ""WindowsXP Inside/Out"". Has almost the same content on the stuff I looked up. Well organized, accurate index, very heavy, costs more, has searchable disk of the book contents."
1,Fixing Windows XP Annoyances,"Purchasing this book was a mistake. I expected something similar to""Windows 98 Annoyances"" by the same author. There was no chapter on the Registry, and little or no information about the Registry."
2,Not very helpful or organized,"I bought this book with more expectation than what I got when I received it in the mail. I needed to fix the slow bootup of Windows XP and there is hardly anything mentioned in this book about it. The negative tone of voice and his opinon of how to do things in XP do not help the book either. He seems to not like Microsoft products very well so he critizes how they made Windows XP with extra effects, just for marketing purposes when they are quite interesting to me and I'm sure others too. The spelling errors aren't too good either and it shows how little time he put into proof reading it before it was published, thus showing how little he cared. His knowledge is questionable now too since he is careless on the spelling mistakes and grammar errors too. I knew I should have bought the Microsoft Windows XP Inside/Out. I recommend that over this lousy book which is of not much help for people who know a lot about computers."
1,the worst piece of crap to ever hit music stores...,"i was skeptical when buying this cd. i liked there other 2 cds, but i knew there was a different singer. i thought...ok so it'll be a little different. different was RIGHT. it sucked. song after song of screaming vocals, messy tempos, and pure vanilla, meaning that it ALL sounded the same. what were they thinking? well, at least they've improved by dropping their ex piece of crap singer. and now they're but more appealing. but NEVER EVER even think about buying this cd or you will sincerely regret it."
4,Rockin' out to old school...,"Recommended for the true YC fan, this album rocks out like no other. With a harder, more edgy vibe, ""Were We Stand"" is a great album that kicks off Yellowcards earlier high school days, long before the punkish waves of songs like ""Way Away"" and ""Breathing."" Songs such as ""Lesson Learned,"" ""Uphill Both Ways,"" and ""On the Brink"" exhibit Yellowcard's true passion for the music, apparent even in their early days. A great album to listen to for letting off some steam!"
4,Nice read,I read this book while traveling and it was a pretty enjoyable read. I felt the author portrayed what it was like in a very interesting way. I liked how non-judgmental he was concerning people from different backgrounds and beliefs.
3,Disappointing,"I found it disappointing. Too many chapters about weird people who took him in, and details that really weren't essential. I wouldn't particularly recommend it. I didn't want to be mean and only give him 2 stars, so I gave him 3... but lets just say his other book ""The Wander Year: one couple's journey around the world"" is MUCH better! Read that one instead!"
5,kindness of strangers,"I enjoyed this book very much because it had a deeper side to it .One gets a ""lesson ""out of it !!Very relaxed book to read .Thank you .ANNETTE"
2,A Dangerous/Stupid Concept,"Going across America without money,as a spiritual experience is both stupid anddangerous.In this day and age,anything could happen.This book did not uplift my spirit.SORRY!,"
1,"Makes me ashamed not only to be American, but to be human","What a godawful story about the scum and dregs of humanity as experienced by one hitch hiker. Even worse, the book was neither entertaining nor particularly well written. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
3,Duck on a Bike,"The illustrations jump out at you, demanding your attention. Animals talking get children's attention right away.This books demonstrates kindness towards the duck from all his friends even though they all felt something different. I loved the ideas that each animal had about them being on a bike.I'm sure small children will be delighted with the dialogue and the colorful pictures.Jennifer Dunagan,author of Auntie Jennie's Puppy:The Adventures of Santana andSantana's Harrowing Halloween"
5,Duck on a Bike - great fun for parents and kids,I borrowed this book from the library for my son and he instantly fell in love with it - as did I - and so I just had to buy it for him. We read it nearly every day and he smiles and laughs each time - and he's only 7 months. A beautiful story with gorgeous pictures and a very funny final page. Enjoy!
3,Fashionista Barbie,"Even though Dooney and Bourke has increasingly declined in popularity on the west coast, they still make a cute Barbie. She looks very stylish and trendy but I would wait until a COACH Barbie is created."
5,The best Harry ever did,"What can I say...this is a sprawling (originally a double album), witty, funny, heart-felt meditation on the onset of middle age and the stock-taking that occurs so often as you hit age 34. My personal favorites include ""Mismatches"", an interesting reversal of traditional sexual politics, ""We Grew Up a Little Bit"", a biting image of the gradual crumbling of a marriage, and ""Mercenaries"", about soldiers and prostitutes and the role each plays. The humor of songs such as ""My Old Lady"" and ""Dance Band on the Titanic"" contrast with the final, 14 minute song ""There Was Only One Choice"" which is a midlife crisis crystalized into a song. I was so glad when this was released on CD, as so many of Harry's albums are only available on record. This is a full, complete work, and though I would agree that ""Greatest Stories"" is better for the Chapin beginner, with ""Cats in the Cradle"" and ""30,000 Pounds of Bananas"", this will always be my favorite work of his."
1,Big disappointment,"After reading the 4 other reviews, and a review in the February 2000 issue of Guitar Player magazine, I was expecting a treat. Alas, I was sorely disappointed. The playing is average, at best, but the singing & song writing is even worse. This CD lacks any resemblence of soul or feeling. Tommy Castro does the blues/funk thing so much better.As for the claim that this is the best new guitarist since Clapton...well, I guess that reviewer doesn't listen to much blues. Put the price of this CD towards the recently released Luther Allison double CD, ""Live in Chicargo"" for an example of how blues should be played....with emotion, feeling and TONE."
5,SUPERB BLUES/ROCK,"After reading reviews ranging from 1 to 5 stars I wasn't sure what to expect. Pleasant surprise all round. Great guitar playing with heaps of originality to add to my collection. Good to great songs and a good voice. True he doesn't re-invent the wheel, but it is a pretty good wheel and I am not sure it needs re-inventing. His tone and phrasing are so original, that I think it would be possible to pick a CONVERSE track amongst dozens of other guitarists ( not something you can say about most guitarists ). Almost every solo is memorable and a masterpiece ( not many better ) For another original take on the blues by a superb virtuoso, this delivers. No regrets, a great CD and I will look out for more releases from this talented guitarist/singer/songwriter."
1,Boring and Predictable,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book contains essentially nothing new. It's a long, high school level essay making a series of disconnected, entirely obvious points about the merits of trying to live longer. A large element of the book deals with ethics. Here's the problem. The author himself is one of the least ethical writers I have ever encountered. Because he was spurned by Roy Walford when he tried to get Walford to help him promote his book, the author went on a rampage to discredit Walford and everything connected to Walford. He is even posting fake ""reviews"", under fake identities, of Lisa Walford's and Brian Delaney's new book, The Longevity Diet, trying to get people to buy his book instead. And this is someone who wants me to buy his book about ethics? My recommendation: don't buy this book, try to write your own instead!"
1,A book for the mindless,Some of the most stupid drivel that you can read. The opinions in this book are full of hyperpole and fiction read as fact. Not worth the paper it is printed on and is a dangerous vehicle for fanatics and the imbalanced. I cannot say more about how strange and dumb this book is. Avoid at all costs.
4,Sunday Suit blew me AWAY!,"Hey, what can i say...where is sunday suit? Why is SIRE records just sitting on them? Radio friendly 3 minute pop tune. Absolutely gorgeous and you can preview the track! (#3)"
2,Wasn't what I thought it would be.,Highly disappointed in this book. It wasn't what I thought it would be. It consisted mostly of venison (specialty items) which are not served in many restaurants.
2,DoctorP,"I bought this fog machine for multiple applications and although it puts out a decent amount of smoke, it requires you to push the button in order to do so. Basically it took someone all night to sit there and push the button to generate the smoke and turn on the machine.Otherwise it worked well and for the money you can't go wrong if you have an application where you can manually control the machine."
2,I returned this product,"While assembling this product one of the plastic screw handles broke. I gave it a shot prior to returning it. I used it outside and while it created some smoke, it wasn't as thick as I anticipated. For those on a limited budget this may work but you should probably use it inside for the best results."
4,Works great,"This fog machine worked fine for my son's Halloween party. It filled our basement with long lasting fog. The fog is a bit smelly, but the kids didn't seem to care. I would have given it five stars, but when it arrived it was leaking fog juice. Not sure if it was a refurb or a return or what. Nevertheless, it works as it should."
2,Remarks that miss the mark,"I like Sherman's approach to music and agree with him on much of his critique of modern music-making and culture. It is a pity, then, that his good points are lost in a seemingly endless series of brief remarks without structure. I'm sure this book would rate 5 stars if it was rewritten into a series of essays; the current format lacks the framework needed to make his observations cogent."
2,Irritating? Pretentious? Dull? All of the above?,"This book offers proof that you can't just throw together your journal jottings and expect to make a readable work. The author may be a good pianist (I've never heard him or heard of him, and I've collected piano recordings for close to half a century now), but he's a lousy composer. Of prose, that is. The short entries are both overly-intellectualized and intellectually unsatisfying. They go too far in their pretentious style and not far enough in content. The writer demands a high degree of concentration, but then doesn't come through with much to say, finally..."
2,I wish it was better,"I wish I agreed that this book deserves four stars - because that would mean that I was able to read through the book and attain some good information from it, which I was not. I am an avid reader with a college education, so my trouble is not illiteracy. It is the format of the book - a rolling description of what happened on stage at one of his seminars. It is written like a play with stage direction. The dialogue might have made sense if the author had left out unimportant fill like ""um...am I supposed to be using empathy now or how I usually speak?"" I could barely follow it, and after a handful of attempts found myself frustrated because I believe there is some good material somewhere in there! I will still give his other books a try IF they are written in a different format, but this is the first time I've truly regretted spending money on a book."
3,Short and sweet,"When I purchased this book I expected a lot more new information. As helpful as the information in this book is, it was basically a compilation of articles that I had already found and read on the Internet."
4,Respect,"This book, like others of Rosenberg is about respect, so don't let the title fool you. It has some valuable insights in understanding difficult people."
4,"being me, loving you",Excellent recommendation on how to be aware of your feelings and commmunicate with your partner to enhance life together. Recommend.
5,Listen to me,"Ok I can understand the merit of these bad reviews, but I think your being overly critical. Forget the regular game as it is lame, no doubt;but, the edit mode is deep and provided me with the most enriching experiance I ever had in front of a Television. THIS GAME TAKES TIME! Plain and simple. I felt the so called ""professional critic"" missed the boat on this game entirely. Fighter maker is for an intelligent creative gamer who always fantasized about making a fighter with moves dreamt up from his own brain. This is where this game DELIVERS! Look beyond the obvious design flaws(like not being able to edit the appearance). Look forward to the upcoming RPG maker, imagine creating your own RPG!"
2,15 blocks of memory?,"I liked the ability to create moves and all or use existing moves to make some godlike fighter. I gave it the time but there were a few things that drove me to get this. 1.In hopes that agetec would release RPG maker in the US. 2.I really believed it was indeed state of the art. 3.I thought that there were backgrounds I mean this even makes Kensei look good. I also did not enjoy the horrible characters they give you to do this with.(One looks like Skullomania from Street Fighter EX, and another looks like a rip off of Tiger Jackson from Tekken 3.) I also did not like the fact that a save takes up 15 blocks of memory I know your are saving a lot but that is a whole memory card. It also does not load correctly in case you wish to delete it, so if you save make sure you really like this game."
3,Regular,"Regular producto, simple, regular presentación, fácil instalación, no es una buena inversión, no cuesta lo que vale, mala experiencia en esta compra."
1,Replaces Joico Resolve?,This product IS NOT THE SAME!!!! Not even close! Anyone who tells you it is is lying! I have used Resolve on my hair for years and had no problems. I bought a huge bottle of this K-Pak and my hair is now frizzy and nasty. They need to bring back Resolve and quit messing around.
1,"This is a children's book, and not a good one at that","Less a biography than a series of fairly random facts loosely organized into chapters such as ""Making Music"" and ""On the Farm"", this 28-page booklet seems geared to elementary school readers. In consideration of that I'm penalizing it for typographical errors and bizarre paragraph construction. The quality of the 9 black and white photos is just plain dreadful. If you're at better than a 4th-grade reading level this is not worth bothering with even for the novelty value."
2,Great music - great footage - poor product,"I now have to wonder if this original footage actually had sound. This 'product' was filmed at some amazing live MC5 performances, yet the footage, as engaging as it is, is spliced erratically with no real relation to the music. The track selection is excellent, but these performances are available on cd already (the DVD features a surround sound option for audio). Soon I found myself more annoyed with the erratic editing than entertained, and it was only the sheer awe of seeing them in action that held my interest throughout this release.The Sinclair interview is interesting, but also marred by an audio track that runs throughout the interview in which Sinclair and another musician make loopy beatnik sounds and words, distracting from the Sinclair interview.I guess when you've done that many drugs, you'll throw anything together to make a buck."
3,"An adequate, if not essential release","A strange choice, as Blue Note has commandeered what was originally a Riverside session from 1959 (""Cannonball Adderley Collection - Volume 6"".) The featured players are pianist Wynton Kelly, and a rythm section of Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb on tracks 1 thru 4, with Percy & Tootie Heath taking over on tracks 5 thru 9. The songs here are mostly ballads and laid back material, with 2 alternate takes. I really don't see this as being ""essential,"" but for Cannonball fans, it's a worthy, if not somewhat curious, release."
1,This Was No Solution For Me,"I used this Resolve cleaner on my rug for a stain from cocktail sauce. I assumed from everyone's trust in Resolve branded products for their low prices and good performance, I bought this to clean out the stain. This was definitely no sloution for me. Only the slightly colored stains would come out. Everything else was still red-orange and even noticeable in the dark. I have bought generic Albertsons carpet solution on the stain and it worked wonderfully. This proves this Resolve product needs to be redone. I would not recommend any Resolve carpet cleaning products. The price was great but the performance was very poor."
5,Favorite CD for 5 Years Running,"This has been my favorite CD ever since it came out - it never leaves my car, even when friends beg to borrow it. I can't say enough good things about it. It fits every mood perfectly - when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm angry, when it's raining, when it's sunny, when I'm running late, when I'm taking my time...it's the best driving CD in the world!"
5,Intelligent trance compilation,"George Acosta of Miami Beach's finest, the Shadow Lounge, delivers one of the best mixed trance/progressive house compilations in a while. Songs such as Ayla's ""Angelfalls"", Stray Dog's ""Mirror"", Green Court's ""Follow Me, and Taucher's ""Child of the Universe"" are just a few of the 14 seamlessly blended tracks. Hard to find this quality of music at a domestic price. Will give you a little taste of what 3:00 a.m feels like at the Shadow Lounge."
1,Pretty bad ideas...PARTY FOUL!,"What happened here!? All of these events have an absolutely horrifying use of color and a tacky implementation of ""style""... I am unsure of the experience of the other reviewers...but I am a bit scared of their judgment.The author's technicolor ideas are thrown off even more by what looks like cheap rentals of yesterday's popular item. It appears that all of his ideas are a day late and a dollar more than what you could find yourself... Eew..."
3,Fast Life,"It's a nice escape of a book. A little too unreal but then again, so is real life. These people live life faster than anyone I know and I live in the Freshman dorms. Though it's fun and entertaining I wouldn't reccomend it if you want that happy ""I've just read a book"" closure."
4,brando: the biography,i had heard so much about this book over the years. all great. this is a gift to a special friend and i'm very pleased with what arrived.
1,Rod Lip Synching very badly,"This video features Rod on German television pretending to sing Passion, Baby Jane and What Am I Gonna Do--and he's doing it very badly--AND if that weren't bad enough--two of them are cut off before it's over. The only saving grace is Rod actually sings Tonight's the Night live--to a recorded backing track with Britt Ekland even doing her French thing backstage live. That is semi-interesting. So if you wanna pay $12 for one song--go for it. But it's a quick four minutes. NOT RECOMMENDED. All Rod fans looking for good live footage should get LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL, VH1 Storytellers, and/or the 1984 Rod Stewart Concert Video. Vagabond Heart is also passable. If you want Rod videos from his MTV Glory Days--get ""Rod Stewart Storyteller 1984-1991. """
5,Perfectly Sublime!,"Nina Rota and Classical music combine to create one of the greatest soundtracks ever. The music will have you reliving fellini's masterpeice every time you hear it. like the film, this score is truly unforgettable."
1,"Lurid, badly-written biography of mysterious cultural icon","This book can best be described as ""lurid,"" with a sort of ""oh, wow"" attitude. It venerates Dean at the same time that it wants to cut him down to a common street hustler. Alexander is a terrible writer. His style is choppy and he often uses the wrong everyday word. Also, some of his facts are wrong, such as having Dean and friends hitchhike to Indiana via Des Moines. Not even a badly-educated actor would do that! The reader will find this startling at times but not very informative"
4,Great Godzilla film!,"I read a number of the reviews for this movie and none of them mention how different this movie is from the many that came before it. It has a very human aspect to it, the plot does not just begin with Godzilla or some other monster showing up and subsequent events. It shows the evolution of Mechagodzilla's creation and all those involved from scientists to pilots. And for the first time we have a Godzilla movie where a woman soldier takes center stage."
3,the new film by Maasaki Tezuka: Good or Bad,"Godzilla against MechaGodzilla, or GxMG is a much better film than GxM[Godzilla vs megaguiras]But is a big disappointment compared to GMK[godzilla mothra king ghidorah giant monsters all out attack]. The main reason for this is that GxMG is not as serious a film as GMK, godzilla 1985 and the japanese version of the original. But effects wise, it isn't bad. Also, this the best Tristar Godzilla DVD release yet because it contains the japanese language and english subs that are a direct translation to the japanese version, unlike previous tristar releases, and this movie needed it bad, because the english dub is horrendous. So the overall DVD is pretty good."
2,Disappointing,"I am a die hard fan, but was disappointed with this film. The storyline seemed way too contrived, especially between the female lead and the doctor who has an interest in her. I've seen better fight scenes in the previous 2 films. There were times when Godzilla just stood there while he was blasted with lasers and missles.Most of the special effects were pretty good, but there were some real boners too. For instance, they added a black and white computer animated sequence of the 1954 Godzilla. This scene is just a couple of seconds long, but very poorly done.I am a huge fan of the 1993 Godzilla vs. Mecha-Godzilla film and thought that this entry was a lot less entertaining."
4,A Good Godzilla Addition,"Well, this is the 26th movie for the big G. This movie is pretty good in my opinion. The main character seems to have many problems and she is very captivating to watch. She pulls off her job very well. As far as the fighting goes, that is done pretty well to. MechaG looks better than ever, and even has a name in this movie. He is called Kiryu. The main plot is Japan trying to build a weapon that can stop Godzilla. So, many scientists gather to try and come up with a solution. They decide to remove the late 50's Godzilla remains from the ocean and use them to build their weapon, MechaGodzilla. There are two battles between the two. They are both done very well I think. The only gripe I have is that it could have been a bit longer. There were far too many human scenes in my opinion. More monster fights would have been better. But still, this is a good DVD to get, and if you're a fan of Godzilla, then you should own this cool flick."
5,THE LEGACY OF CONFLICTS,E3VEN THOUGH ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES ARE NOW NOT USED BY MANY COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD PAST CONFLICTS HAHE LEFT A TERRIBLE MINEFIELD LEGACY. ALTERNATINES TO MINES ARE NOW BEING EXPLORED BY MANY COUNTRIES AND NOT BEFROE TIME. A GOOD READ AND A GOOD TEXT.
1,First and last turkeydove,"This is the first Turtlredove book that I had read. So juvenile and chidish, as in Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew, but no-where as interesting and entertaining. It must be a simple money-grab, or how else would this have seen the light of day."
2,Complete letdown,"Hmmmm, I normally like Turtledove and alternate history type books, but this one was kind of a letdown. Let me preface by saying I did not know this was for young adults. However, with a good book, that should not matter. Gunpowder Empire follows the Solter family who spend their summers on the frontier of the Roman Empire trading items such as Swiss Army knives for grain. Jeremy and Amanda are the teen-age children who get left in charge when their parents must return to the present for an emergency. Of course they get stuck there and are unable to communicate with anyone from home. Various problems present themselves and are neatly fixed by the end of the book. I was let down, I found this a little boring and at times tedious. I will not read anymore of the series."
3,A bit disappointing,"If you've read and loved Turtledove's other series as I have, you will probably be disappointed with this take on alternate reality. There is none of the gritty tooth and nail conflicts that made his other works, The Worldwar Saga and The Great War books just to name a few, totally immerse you in their plots. I got the distinct feeling that I was being talked down to and perhaps this is the crux of the issue.Not far into the book I came to realize that this was written for a juvenile audience. Looking at it from that point of view, the characters which were not fleshed out as they usually are and the more simplistic storyline became far more palatable to me. I believe that this would be a great book for young people who are just exploring the genre. Two teens trapped in an alien environment with no adults for support. It is unquestionably written with great talent, just don't expect the raw, real world environs so predominant his other books."
5,A Great Cookbooh,"I have purchased several cookbooks by Favorite Recipes of Home Economics Teachers, and I am completely satisfied with each book. The recipes are fantastic with such a great variety of recipes. These are the best recipe books that I have ever purchased!!!I am also satisfied with the pricing of books through Amazon."
4,Great calculator but...,It's a great calculator over all. Viewing angle is terrible. you have to look almost directly on top of it to see. Most of the time I have to prop it up with something in order to see it clearly. A built-tilt or backlight would be nice.
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is the best 8"" sub money can buy. I had this for 2 years and will never get rid of it. Its PERFECT for small rooms and especially apartments because it doesnt shake pictures off the walls but it FILLS the sound beautifully. The bass is SOOOOO CLEAN. Great sounding sub. Ive had 10"" subs that you grab from CC and Bestbuy for under 2 bills and they are garbage. Look around and you can probably nab this for under $300."
3,"Great book, but bad printing job","I thought that both stories were great. Then as I got to the end of the second story, and the book started over, literally."
5,Beautiful,"I really like both stories in this book. I especially love Day Leclaire's Her Secret Santa, because I like how she paints on his desk and creates a fairytale for him to look at everyday. I like how Jacq abd Mathias both develop as characters."
2,"A good value, but not a great one","1. The screen only rotates to the left....not to the right. This is a serious limitation under many conditions.2. Adding the battery significantly increases the depth of the player, from 1.2 inc. to almost 2 inches. It weighs the same as a light notebook with battery.3. The battery has a caution to ONLY charge it FOR NO MORE than 8 hours, with other admonitions better suited to NiCad than Lithium ion...such as draining the battery before charging. Therefore, the cautions mean that you cannot leave the battery on the player with the player plugged in!!!4. The cover over the playing compartment is alarmingly thin and does not engage with a very reassuring click. Important plastic latches are very very thin, such as that locking the unit down.The player stutters when there is movement (brief and wide apart) when playing back DVDR."
2,not a great deal,"I purchased this DVD player for a road trip I was taking with my 8 and 5 year old boys. I followed directions and charged the battery for exactly as long as indicated in the instructions (there are loads of warnings about not overcharging it). The battery lasted only 1 hour.So I tried to plug it into the car charger, and the car charger melted and shorted out my car. Now it will cost me to fix the power supply in my car! And the car adapter is useles.."
1,Secrets of French Design,"I didn't care for the book. Not enough pictures. More for the advanced decorator who wants the fine details in writing rather than pictures. I'm more of a 'visual' person rather than literal so I need pictures. You may find it 'just what you need"". Not for me."
1,"French Design With a Heavy Dose of Texas Decor ""Sensibilities""","This book is strictly a representation of a Texan's uneducated and ""nouveau riche"" view of the basic elements of French design rather than a true representation of French design and the many centuries of refinement that are reflected in myriad French design elements. This book -- and, for that matter, the whole series of Ms. Phillip's ""design"" books -- relies on the gullibility of the nouveau rich masses to whom they apparently represent the quintessence of ""good taste."" Better to look to some of Linda Dannenberg and Guy Bouchet's handsome photographic imagery of the ""real thing"" if you're searching for some true insights into what elements are integral to the often understated but always correct esthetics of French design."
2,A Bore,"Halfway through this book I had an incredible urge to hurl it at the wall. But I paid for it, so I forced myself to finish it. I was sorry that I forced myself. It was depressing. I don't understand how people can rave about this book. A history and geography lesson of Istanbul would have been much more interesting. Pamuk abandoned the usual formula of entertaining the reader, instead creating some sort of literary experiment. I hated it. Don't buy it."
1,The Lost Pages,"We bought this book set in October 2009 for our son. He started reading them last week and managed to read the first four books in 3 days. Then came the Lost Colony... and the Lost Pages. Twenty three pages are missing from p278 to 311, then further it jumped from 342 back to 311. Frustrating my son was, and was using vocabulary not included in this book set (I hope since I did not read it).I'm afraid he will just have to imagine the missing part...Amazon is not to be blamed for this and I did not see in the reviews anybody having experience this. Just bad luck! We're going to try to find a copy here in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which might be challenging."
5,E. Lynn Harris has done it again,"I was at the bookstore bright and early to get this one. Another page turner. Well worth the reading. I was so into the book, I almost missed by train stop. Please dont stop writing. Keep the books coming."
4,It's Been A Pleasure,"As usually E. Lynn Harris's books are intriguing and wonderfully exciting. Becuase I have read his previous books, I feel that picking up ""Any Way the Wind Blows"" has been like catching up with an old friend.I am pleased to say that Harris's books have brought some closure to the pain and suffering of Yancy and Basil. But it has also brought up new questions of the future of our be loved main characters.For now, it seems that there will be a new book. One that I am hoping to read and love.If this is your first time reading this saga, you'll love the joys, pains and life-like situations written in this fantasy. E.Lynn Harris's books are great becuase he has taken financially comfortable afrocan americans and placed them in real life situations and have showed how they failed and triumphed."
3,The Review,"As always when I hear that Mr. Harris has a new book coming out I am out of control and can't wait until I have his new book in my hand.Well, I got his new book, read it, and felt that it was okay. Not his best work.To much going on and sadly not enough.Whats with Sean? Sean acting like some bitter queen and/or person (smile) to Basil. Whats with that? This is surely not the Sean that we met back in, And This Too Shall Pass.I understand people change but this is a big stretch. What else was there? Ava, the surprise at the end, Bart acting the way he is, Raymond making a surprise visit, and was he flirting with Basil?Mr. Harris has spoiled me and therefore I expect nothing less but his last three books have been okay.That however does not mean that I am gong to stop buying his books as he is still one of my favorite authors and I will continue to buy his books once they come out.Happy reading......."
4,"Quick, funny, & light reading","I truly enjoyed this novel's lighthearted story, much, much more than Not a Day Goes By. Basil was his usual self and the other characters were just as interesting. This novel is a page turner full of Harris' well known scandelous events. However, if you want something deep, enriching, and/or life changing this is not the book for you. Yet if you want some non thought provoking entertainment that will leave you with a smile, this is the book for you."
5,"1, 2, 3 ,4 no 5 SNAPS UP!!!","Mr Harris has out did himself with this one. Ok I read this book in 3 days! It was a great read from the cover page to the last line of the book. I have to admit, the novel right before this one was rather boring, but Mr Harris truly made up for it with this novel.Even though there was a great deal of deception in this novel, there was also a great deal of growth amongst some of the characters.These novels by Mr Harris are true eye openers for the women that refuse to believe the man out there that are on the DOWN LOW"
4,Getting Better Each Time!,"I have loved all of E's books from the start. I can't say this was the best, but it was just as entertaining as all the others. This time the instigators got what they deserved and some new characters were introduced which made it a little more interesting. The book was the perfect length and it didn't drag at all! I was glad that Basil and Yancey learned some valuable lessons together and they both had good endings. Now, someone needs to give that Ava a little chat or give her what she has been dishing out!What I liked most was that book wasn't totally predictable and the characters were real and believeable. E. Lynn Harris has a fan for life!"
4,The usual bunch of unlikable characters,"This book features the usual bunch of unlikable characters from E. Lynn Harris' previous best seller, ""Not a day goes by."" Although you may think that's not possible, he has also introduced a few more characters who are even more unlikable. It was easy to read, but contained no surprises. Take it to the beach, or on your next vacation. It might help to keep you from making some choices you could regret!"
2,too much name dropping,"I am one of those ELH fans, that was there from the very beginning. After reading ""invisible life"" I was hooked. But now I will not waste my hard earn dollars on anymore of his books. I know ELH fans are wondering what happened to the characters that we've come to love (i.e Raymond, Jared). It's a good think i borrowed this book. The name dropping in this book, got on my nerves, monica this, brandy that, Dammit this is FICTION. I can read ebony or jet and get the same info. I didn't feel a thing for any of the characters in the book, mama-drama Ava, oh please! what played out, over the top soap opera, did he find her from. This book was silly to say the least. It lacked his usual wit and depth. I enjoy reading books by AA authors but the whole gay/bisexual thing is played out. Do not insult our intelligence by thinking todays readers will buy just anything. We need substance!"
1,Can't learn how to dance from this video,There is no way that a person without a prior dance knowledge can learn how to dance with Fatima. She is to difficult for beginners. The video doesn't show all the details of her movements. I'm very dissatisfied. I was not even able to get to the end of the video.
3,Not For Beginners.....,"Although Fatima is an EXCELLENT choreographer, this video will NOT teach you to dance if you do not already have rhythm. I was a professional cheerleader and this was somewhat difficult at times. However, I think it is because it is not taught in the reverse like most instructional videos. If you have had no instruction before, you can't watch her and do it at the same time. You have to face away from her and look over your shoulder to mimic the moves exactly as she is doing them, and this could get confusing for beginners. I think she should have broke it down with a reverse angle as well.Overall, Fatima is WONDERFUL and she has excellent rhythm, enthusiasm and stamina. I will use some of the moves for my junior squad."
5,Go Fatima ! Go Fatima! Go Fatima! Go! Go! Go! Go!,Yo girl! U got ur groove on right! this is the best dance video ever! I love Da Jig and Everbody dances because they are fun and easy duh! Aaliyah was good and hard and a good challenge! I cant wait for another video
2,NOT a workout video,"I bought this video after seeing Fatima on The View where they were touting it as a workout video even though the cover of the package says ""Learn To Dance"". It is broken down into three segments.The first segment teaches you about 30 seconds (literally) of Aaliyah's video, ""Are You That Somebody."" She breaks it down in three parts, teaching you about 7-10 seconds of dance at a time. The second segment teaches you about 30 seconds from the Back Street Boy's video, ""Backstreet's Back"" with the same format and the last segment teaches you about a minute of her own steps to which you can add your own flavor.The entire video is 40 minutes but once you learn all the steps, your total ""workout"" routine lasts about 2 minutes. You learn some great steps that I'm sure you could incorporate into some hot moves in the clubs, but if you're looking for a workout video, this isn't it!"
5,GREAT DVD!,I had the opportunity to see Djavan in the North Sea Jazz festival a couple of years ago and his performance was excellent.This DVD captures another great performance by one of the greatest Brazilian musicians of his time. The sound quality of this DVD is great and the added bonus videos are a great feature. I recommend this DVD to any one who appreciates great music.
2,a good read,"ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK STARTED OUT SLOW, AND RATHER UNBELIEVEABLE, I WAS VERY GLAD THAT I FINISHED THE BOOK. WE NEED TO REMEMBER, THAT FICTION MYSTERY WRITING IS JUST THAT..FICTION. WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT---MEL HAD ONE HELL OF A LIFE."
5,Good album,"I've been playing guitar for 8 years, I have two Ibanez RGs. I am a guitar-afficionado. I get this CD, if for nothing else then for Air Guitar. I haven't heard such a beautiful composition ever since I've listened to Yngwie Malmsteen. BEAUTIFUL."
2,Ho Hum,"I saw Dave Uhrich open for Tesla in 1994 and was STUNNED by his playing. He put on a Hendrix-like show with his 3 piece power trio.I immediately sought out any recording I could find by him. I was able to find one older release by him which did NOT impress me. I kinda forgot about Dave until last year when I met the guy who played drums on that tour and is currently the drummer for Styx. We talked at length about Dave and what a great player he was. I started looking for current music from Dave and found this. Figured I would take a shot based on the solid reviews I read here. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Weak song writing,pallid vocal performance and simply no punch on this record. Sure Dave is a great player...but there are simply no HOOKS or infectious grooves on this CD. Dave is an amazing player LIVE...but on vinyl...Ive YET to be impressed. If youre considering this record I would recommend ANYTHING by Ritchie Kotzen instead."
4,Another trip to Rosewood,"Bonnie Winn's fictional little town of Rosewood, Texas, gets another new neighbor in Emma Perry. She's now in the Witness Security program (presumably the real Witness Protection Program would sue if their name was used) and on the run from a dangerous arsonist who torched her house and killed her family. She has a deep faith and compassion for others and reaches out to her neighbor, Seth McAllister, a contractor who agrees to help Emma with her new costume shop. They have both loved and lost and we know that they're going to get together in the end, but Winn skillfully shows how difficult it can be to open your heart once it's been broken."
1,You know it's bad when you...,return the book to the library without ever finishing it. This book doesn't even deserve one star. The concept is sophomoric and the writing is stilted. Admirers of Grisham and Balducci will wonder how this author gets published.
2,Naive,This plot had lots of promise but was woefully missing in details and ultimately devolved into a story that was simply too unbelievable to be worth reading. It was disappointing.
2,"Not the Adult Swim CD, and not worth getting.","If, like me, you are trying to find the song used in the first season of Adult Swim (the ""pool music""), which searching the internet claims it was a remix of Tito Puente's Mambo Gallego by D-Code, this is not it.Still I gave this CD a listen. It is a light Jazz CD put out by what looks like some young men from Holland. It is however, very light. It is full of easy listening jazz cliches, which are best in an elevator or phone system.So if your looking for the Adult Swim theme music or some nice easy jazz, either way you're better off looking elsewhere."
3,Small black & white architectural monograph from Gustavo Gili,"ISBN: 8425215765 ONLY is an exclusively black & white, concise, and copiously illustrated paperback survey published by Gustavo Gili (GG) of Barcelona in English and Spanish (side by side). A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project on excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, sketches, etc. At the end, there are several pages with additional information incl. biography. Most of hundreds of only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN: 37643* (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN: 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London)."
2,I didn't like the layout,The audio recording as difficult to listen to. It sounds like a bunch of whining. There is some good information but mostly it is old information.
1,This Book Will Offend Men !!!!!!!!!,"Overall this is an OK book, with pretty good information. It poses financial questions that Suze then answers. The problem is that in 99% of the situations i.e. divorce, prenuptual agreements, or any other situation where the relationship does not work out, IT'S THE MAN'S FAULT. I am about 3/4's of the way through the book and I feel like I'm being insulted on almost every page.A prenuptual, a will in trust, or any other legal document is always to protect the woman. If you are a male you will definetly be offended by this book. AVOID IT.Again, while the book has good information, I would look for an author who has experienced fewer issues with the men in his/her life."
1,Nothing new,Took Suzie advice and lost half of my childs college fund in less than 6 months. Current book not much diffrent from her P.B.S. program.
5,Thorough and Understandable,"As Suze Orman indicates at the beginning of this book, ""The Road to Wealth"" provides practical information for people who look to Suze Orman for clear, honest financial perspectives. Overall, the book is in a question and answer format with explanations of all new terms and examples which confirm the reader's understanding of the material. The chapters may be read independently if a single subject is of concern, or in order. I started at the beginning of the book and have read straight through. I've found the presentation of value personally and have insight, as well, into issues which may be ahead for me or are impacting people whom I know. This is both a reference book and an introduction to financial planning."
5,"Hands on Guide, Great Format, Deteailed information",I thought I had read everything Suze had to say. This book goes even deeper. It's laid out in a concise Q&A format that helps you quickly find the answers you're looking for. I've used this book as a tool while online picking my mutual funds. This is one book I would purchase instead of check out at the library. The information is everywhere. Truly a book with having.
3,"Good, common, practical advice offered.","Suze is the eternal optimist - ever hear her speak on the radio? Her enthusiasm and geniune excitement about this topic shines through and probably what really propells you, the reader, along through pretty ordinary information. Don't get me wrong, the information is great and primarily speaks to the novice investor, who is obviously the target of the book. If you are Warren Buffet, this book is obviously not meaty enough for you. From my standpoint as a somewhat experienced investor, it offered little new information but did reinforce solid habits (which I am trying to maintain!) Kristy Welsh, author of the book, ""Good Credit is Sexy."""
1,"Avoid this book : too little , no linux , too proprietary","This book is best avoided.Around 1/3rd of the book is elementary introductory stuff about NT and Unix. The rest is about proprietary versions of Unix and various items of commercial software. The author is employed by SCO and SCO products feature very very very very prominently in this poor excuse for a book. It also shows you pretty pictures of Hummingbird Exceed. It has a worthless discussion of the X Windowing system at a level that moved me to tears of disgust.Amazingly, Linux has just a few lines. Samba has about one page.This book is outdated and not worth the shelf space. Save your money.Stick to O'Reilley books. If you absolutely have to read this wretched book, borrow it from some university library."
4,Good Classics,"TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends, Bette DavisAll these movies are great. I would hightly recommend this DVD to anyone. I like this collection very much"
5,BD Fans...,"Thank you TCM for this great collection! Movies were wonderful, sharp and clear. Still hold up wonderful and BD is in her prime for all of them. This is a must! Cheers, William"
3,Hoops,"The book I read was Hoops. It was not a very good book in my opinion. The story line was not very good, not the best walter has done yet. The characters in the book were kinda childish and didn't really seem realistic. The action in the book was ok but it was very repetive. I think the book is for younger kids. It was a decent basketball book but I have read better books."
5,I like this book a lot.,"Hoops is a book about a young 17yr old,named Lonnie.Lonnie lives in Harlem New York.He works at a hotel and he also lives there. Lonnie is playing basketball one night and mets this guy Cal.Abpot two weeks later Lonnie and his friends hear about a basketball tournimate.They decide to form one but they need a coach.Cal and Lonnie really didn't get along at first so Lonnie didn't like the idea of cal being the coach.Then Lonnie gave Cal a chance and they became very good friends.Lonnie tells Cal his dream of playing pro basketball,Cal tells Lonnie how he used to play pro basketball.Cal also says how much pressure you have when you play it pro. Lonnie don't want to hear what cal has to say and he decides to continue to follow his dream of playing pro basketball.Hoops also tells about how it is to grow up in a tough neighborhood.It also shows how friends stick bye eachother no matter what.The point of the book is to follow your dreams.so yeah I like the book a real lot."
4,chech this out b!,"Hoops was a good book about an African-American teen who loves basketball. He's on a team and an ex pro ballplayer becomes thier coach. Throughout the story,the ex pro, Cal, and the teenager, Lonnie, become close. Cal shares his stories about the pros with Lonnie.Myers did a good job with this story.Most of the characters I could relate to in one way or another. The book pulled me in every chance I got to read it. I highy recommend it if you like basketball."
3,Hoops *,"Hoops is an entertaining story about an African American teen, Lonnie, and his passion for playing basketball. It starts out slow in the beginning, when you learn about the main character, but speeds up as it goes along. He makes friends and learns about them. His coach Cal has interesting stories from his basketball history that gets Lonnie even more hooked on playing his game. Lonnie and his team learn deeper meanings in the sport and their lives. One example is that even if someone have the gift and have the passion for something, that doesn't mean they will make it. It doesn't mean they will suceed. It is an intriguing story about working hard for what you deserve, or what you believe in- in this case, basketball. I recommend this book to anyone who has a love for basketball. I give this book three stars. * * *- Laura (student)"
2,My Point Of View,This Book Was Not That Interesting To Me Because They Made Basketball Seem So Whack That I Got Bored Of It.I Think That This Book Was Kind Of Weird.I Didnt UnderStand This Book For Nothing Because I Was Always Absent So I Cant Really Judge This Book Like That But When I Was Here I Didnt Like The Story Beacause It Was Boring.I Think That This Book Is Stupid And Dumb.I Think That This Book Is For Boys.I Wasted My Time Reading This Book But I Had To Read It Was School.I Dont Know What To Tell You If U Need To Know About The Book Read It YourSelf Because EveryBody Has There Own Opinions And Some People Like The Book And Some Dont Like The Book.I Think That I Wont Read This Book Ever Again Just Because I Dont Like It And Because Its Boring And Supid.I Rather Read A Little Kids Novel For Real.Sorry For Those That Think The Book Is Good Its Just My Point Of View U Feel Me.
2,Interesting But Not Helpful,"On the plus side, this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises. I was very excited at first, but unfortunately none of the exercises, massages, meditations, etc I tried seemed to help any of my health problems, even after a month. The book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury, yet leaves me crying in disappointment. I will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile, but I don't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point."
1,The Healer Within,This book was written in 1997 - I guess that's my main complaint. It's very comprehensive and a little too wordy. I was looking for more advanced and current information. It's encouraging if you are a beginner and just discovering Tradtional Chinese Medicine but it was too simplistic for me.
2,Doesn't come close to Devil's Night,"Dont get me wrong, i like eminem and i like D12. This album out of the 21 tracks maybe has 5 good ones. The albums best are ""how come"" and ""good die young"". I was just very disapointed with the CD. With 21 tracks you know that there are gonna be many pointless skits and bad songs. I almost gave this album 3 stars, but it isnt worth that. What ever happened to the great songs like ""fight music"", ""Revelation"", ""Pistol Pistol"" and ""That's How..."" from Devils Night. I know this isnt the real D12 so hopefully they will come back strong."
3,"Good, not great","This cd is nowhere near any eminem solo album. The beats are too repetitive, and the hooks too annoying. But overall, its still a solid. the last 2 tracks and the 1st track are some of the best ive heard from D12. Buy this cd if you need a new rap album."
1,THE WHINING WHITEBOY AND THE DOWN SYNDROME DOZEN RETURNZ,"Hey you haterz quit makin fun of my favorite group, u dont know nothing about thiz hardcore hip-hop album......JUST KIDDING....Datz whut idiot fanz be sayin, but they dont know nothing bout real hip-hop or gangsta rap. Why yall listen to garbage muzik??? I get headachez listenin to theze idiotz known az feminem and the down syndrome dozen....cmon wtf iz wit dat dude that sayz he f**kz midgetz.....pure retarded muzik....I REALLY WANT HIP-POP TO END.....especially dat stupid 50 centz mumblin dumazz....buy muzik dat where made in tha 87-99 fo real muzik.....buy Esham or Natas albumz.....Eminem and D12 copy their stylez frum Esham....sumthin half yall don know boutIf thiz review iz not helpful to you and you want to support Hip-Pop so you can get every idiot into new bubblegum rap pop junk...press ""NO"".....if your a true hip-hop, rap, gangsta rap listener....press ""YES"".....Help yoself....i jus wanna see if there iz more retardz in thiz world!!!"
3,iz okay but needed more effort,"I never heard the debut D12 album Devils Night, but this album gave me a good idea of what they might have sounded like. But anyway, this album is okay. the only tracks i really like are My Band and 40 Oz (is there a video for it???) and the rest are either okay or kinda bad. Eminem soundz a bit different in this album than he did in his solo albumz, cuz in this he sounds more laid back and in hiz soloz he sounded like he had real energy. honestly i think Eminem should use his normal rapping voice cuz if he did i would like this album a lot more. Without him, i would not listen to this album."
4,D twizzee r BACK!,"What a great album by D12. People think just becasue its D12 they are all funny but this isn't just the case in this album.The best songs are 'Just Like U', 'My Band', '40 oz' and 'The Good Die Young'If u r a fan of d12 or eminem in anyway GET THIS ALBUM"
3,"DON""T BUY IT!!",This cd was a disappointment! I was expecting another Devil's Night and boy was I wrong. Bizarre is not as bizarre as he was on the first album and that was really what I liked about Devils night was the over the top lyrics by Bizarre. It sounded like this cd was rushed and there are only abotu three songs on this album that are worth listening to. I will NEVER ever spend money on d-12 again.
3,"Good 2nd Effort, 3 1/2","Wow, I was was really amazed that they went kind of serious and didn't have a lot of funny songs on this album. I really think they should have put a PSA with Eminem talking then the rest of the crew starts beating the crap out of him for saying something about black girls. They steped their game up a little on some of the songs but others were in my opinion, Just Wack! Don't get me wrong this was a good album but just good not a 5 star album like some of the members put on there.All the beats on this album are sick! The songs I would look out for areHow ComeGit UpGood Die YoungLeave Dat Boy AloneALSO WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T READ THE SAUCE AND BENZINO'S BS ABOUT SHADY RECORDS AND EMINEM. GO XXL!"
2,it's ok,"this cd isn't anything special. i liked maybe 5 songs off the last one and i only like 4 or 5 songs off this one. out of the whole clan, only 2 or 3 of them can rap. i don't like proofs voice at all, it's like method mans and i hate him. eminem's tracks on this are the best, just like they were on the last one. the only good d-12 songs i've heard were on eminems cds"
1,C.R.A.P.,"they try to be funny, doesn't workthey try to be serious, doesn't workthey use eminem to sell records.... BINGO!!!"
2,The Most Important Review You Read,"Out Of 21 Tracks There Are Only 5 Tracks Worth Listening To. As Always Eminem Outshines The Rest Of The Group But The Others Dont Do Too Bad With Keeping Up, Proof Is Actually Kinda Sick But Members Like Bizarre Are Just Laughable. The 5 Decent Tracks Are: Git Up, How Come, 6 In The Morning, Good Die Young, And American Psycho 2.....The Other 16 Tracks Can Be Tossed. Dont Buy This CD Just Download Those 5 Songs."
1,D12's World comes crashing Down.,"This is just another dull and disastrous album by feminem's garbage group, songs are terrible mainly the overrated my band, the writing is horrible, and the rapping is ridiculousthis is just another reason that the music business is getting worse and worse and this album should be one of themAn early canidate D12 World for one of the year's worst albums.NO STARS."
4,This is a good cd,"This cd is good not great.. So much talent in this group I would expect more lyrical content!! But I do think the Album is good. With songs like 40 oz and Im gonna get my gonna, it keeps me listening!! I think they should focus more on the group as oppsed to the Eminem is the lead singer joke..Maybe let other people sing the chours. I Would recmond this Cd to anyone who likes a good rap CD, it could be better but I would by it again!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,NOT NERE AS GOOD AS DEVILS NIGHT 2.5 STARS,this album sucks. there are a few good songs but most of its pretty average. if u see it for under $15 then it might just be worth getting but if its over $15 don't get it
5,Well designed,"This bag is just what I've been looking for. It is well designed, has a right size and light-weight."
1,FALLA DE ENTREA DEL PRODUCTO,"LA ENTREGA DEL PRODUCTO TUVE UN TIEMPO ESTIMADO DEL 10/09/2007 AL 19/09/2007 Y AUN NO HA SIDO ENTREGADO EN LA DIRECCIÓN QUE REGISTRE EN AMAZON Y POR LO TANTO DESEEO CANCELAR LA COMPRA, YA QUE LA MISMA FUE CARGADA A MI TARJETA."
1,A Euro-trash Production,You buy a DVD first of all to SEE the opera. If all you want is to hear great voices -- buy a CD. This is a typical Euro-Trash production so don't waste money on it.You didn't like my review TOUGH. I didn't like the production so I don't like the DVD. I hate producers who want to reinterpert operas and not stick to the composer and Librettist vision. This is NOT the vision of Berlioz --- The voices may be Ok but there are better voices singing this opera than on this DVD. Go for the recording of Jon Vickers for great singing.Again this production is so ugly don't waste money on the DVD. If you want a DVD then there is Met version.
5,Sabbath Not Nailed 2 the Cross,Wonderful Book. It helped me to understand that the Sabbath was not nailed to the Cross as several Sunday churches preach. It is false to preach that they were nailed to the cross and those preachers and reverends will have 2 answer to God for misleading his sheep so they can benefit from the $$$$ Monetary Contributions from church members!!!
2,There are better books out there!,"Though long and drawn out, this book is not the end-all of dog trick books. I have a problem with his sometimes coercive methods, and the nature of some of the 'tricks' (like teaching your dog to snarl and growl over an object). Not that you can't teach your dog to do anything you want, but he needs to be a whole lot clearer that any behavior that is rewarded will increase exponentially in frequency once it's been rewarded. Teaching your dog to object guard is not a safe thing to do in the hands of the average person. Aside from that, it seems quickly written and as if he tried to make it cover EVERYTHING. It is hard to do that well and he hasn't succeeded. His blurb on clicker training is silly, recommending (against the advice of every clicker trainer and those who invented the method) to click sometimes without treating. In short, head for a more concise, better written book if you'd like to have fun teaching your dog tricks."
4,Pure unadulterated Camp!,"Dreadful movie, it's so bad, it's good....Hilariously good! Any minute I expected a young Joan Collins to stride on the set!"
2,Too many bubbles,This unit moves plenty of water but it also makes too many micro bubbles. The web site states that I should look for signs of cracks on the unit. Not my idea of the way it should perform.
2,Was a good phone system for about a year.,"Purchased this product a little over a year ago and it worked well. Just over a year after the install the system began dropping calls and then started to turn itself off. I won't go through the list of things we did to try and fix the problem, but needless to say none of them worked. Tech support for this product is terrible. The company is now part of Fortinet and while they may support their new products, they have abandoned support of the old talkswitch line of products. I would stay away from this phone system."
3,Just what I needed,"Shipping cost really soaked me I was pissed that home Depot wasn't carrying these anymore, I got to check that out next time alittle more. Delievery was to the house and not the PO Box cool but jezz NY to Cali damn oh well the arrived and the busted up ones are gone, canned the adjustment stick to ones that needed them else where. I hate it when I see James Bond pulls the blinds down a peek instead of using the levelor."
2,Its Kinda a waste of time and money,My friend bought DogZ- I played it and thought it was a pretty neat game cuz you gotta have a pet. But then I was like this game really stinks! After 15 minutes your finished with it and never play it again. Some people may like it because you get a pet. If you cant have a pet-get it. Otherwise dont!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Should make it for gamecube,"It not fair for me because I don't have an Xbox and when my pc version plays it restarts my computer. Come on Atari make Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 for 5 systems. PC, XBOX, Gamecube, PS2, and I'll even settle for GBA if I'm that desperate. I only want this because my computer doesn't like me and never lets me play my games."
4,Very good book but needs more.,The book is a though run down of what we know of planets. The writer gives an brilliant account of what we know about planets at present particularly how they might be able to hold life.What it lacks is some sort of summary at the end! I was quite surprised that nothing like it was supplied. A total of how many sun could hold life. I hope that the writer rewrites it with such a chapter.
4,Cute little book series,We purchased this book as a Christmas present for our son Sebastian who was born in may. We wanted him to be able to see and read his name in some of his books. This book is so cute!!! Love the illustrations but the storyline is a little choppy.
5,horse lover,i liked the tapes very much they arrived as promised and was in great shpe they all worked as promised and the price was fair and the tapes were very helpful. sincerely virginia
2,Okay phone but very inconsistent.,"Okay for the first couple of days this phone worked great, but after about a week it just stopped working all the time. Like the machine would ring but the phone wouldnt turn on so i couldnt answer it. I would wait 5 minutes and then it would work. The answering machine is the only reason that i gave this two stars it really only deserves one. So i dont know maybe my phone is defective but i would not recommend this phone to anyone."
4,You Are Here...or at least you should be.,"""You Are Here"" was definitely an enjoyable read, as it tells a brief moment in history of a gay man coming to terms with moving to New York City from a town in Virginia. This is not to say that it is directed solely toward gay readers; anyone can enjoy this book, as its lessons and learnings apply to people of all genders and sexual orientations. It was a quick, enjoyable read, and Gibson's descriptions about certain events are dead-on. Some make you laugh, some make you cry. I will be on the look out for future books by this author."
4,Excellent to Print on DVD Labels,"This item works great.Burnt till now 25, no problems. I like printing on DVD which was the main reason to buy. The R200 Printer I got prints nicely on the DVD. I would have given 5 stars if the Print surface had glossy finish. I think they may come in the next release(Glossy type). So i advice everyone to buy this printable DVD blanks and Keep your DVD Looks good and organized. I don't bother much about DVD Type or Write Speed, as faster you write on DVD chancees of more errors and the type(-/+) doesn't matter as i play all my DVD's on a Cheap($30 ESA Player) does the job."
2,Cymouse problems with Windows XP,"Well, I bought it on sale and I think I understand why. It's built by a company called Maui Innovation and I'm fairly certain they've gone bankrupt.If you call technical support you get ""Bank of America."" Nice.I've left an email on the support website but I don't expect to hear back from them seeing how half the functions on the website are defunct and don't lead anywhere.Installation is not a problem. I've managed to load in both drivers required by the hardware. The problem is with their software profiler! It doesn't start!Windows XP recognizes the hardware like a dream. To be safe I downloaded the latest drivers from the website (I was amazed to see that the files were still there.)Every time I try to access the profiler I get the error message that cymouse is not recognized and to check all my cables again. Believe me, all the cables are fine and inserted.Don't buy it... unless I hear back from the maker in 72 hours it's going back to the seller."
1,fragile little board,"One little power glitch, and the board is fried. Look for some other networking solution. I have 3 98se machines and an ME machine I attempted to hook together. I've gone through 10! of these boards trying to keep them online. If your digital clocks have ever flashed at you, don't buy this product. You'll be going through these boards like [crazy]. I've been using PC's since 1984, and I've never seen boards fry like this."
2,Ultimate Battle 22... Ultimate let down!,"I hate to break suit when it comes to this game, but it really is very terrible. I mean, there have been a few good Dragon Ball Z games released (Legacy of Goku II, Boudaki), but Ultimate Battle 22 just isn't one of them.First of all, characters react far too slowly. They jump about two inches off the ground. Their energy attacks look nothing like they should and are impossible to do.About the only good thing in this game, as far as I can reckon, is the cover art, the opening movie, the music and the fact that you can play Kid Goku and SSJ3 Goku... which doesn't really matter, because by the time the battle begins, I've already fallen asleep.Lousy game. There were far better Japanese DBZ games which could have been ported to the states."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"Im a huge dbz fan and all but this game really dissapointed me.1) Ok, what in the world is up with those graphics?? This game makes the first mortal kombat game look like a dream come true.2) I DONT THINK ANYONE HEAR UNDERSTANDS JAPANESE!!!!! My gosh, this game isnt fully translated. The people talk in Japanese.3) The characters voices sound REALLY stupid.(goku sounds like a kid)DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"
2,Only Cool looking,We bought this boat for the looks and to run in the lake. It is very underpowered. Hardly moves through the water. Cool looking but don't waste your time. We did not pay $129.00 for it!
4,Great Book,"This book is great if you liked the previous ones, (although i have to give it a four because it sometimes drags in some places.. but otherwise a good booK)"
5,Comfy Shoes!,"These are not only really cute, they are very comfortable as well!! It's what you expect from Clarks, only gettting better!"
3,Babiak is a snake himself,"The main writer, Paul Babiak, does a poor job of covering the subject - which is probably covered better in the book Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us by the second writer, Robert Hare. Babiak is just jumping on what he perceives as as bandwagon and profiting from it, without adding much on his own. He is unscrupulous himself.When he comes to distinguishing between Psychopathy, Sociopathy, and Antisocial Personality Disorder (on page 18-19) he is not helpful, and refers to the DSM-IV instead!When he talks of Psychopathy and Narcissism on pages 40 and 41, one is left with the feeling that psychiatry needs some help itself. From my own experience, I can name a few psychotherapists that are only interested in serving themselves - but are very good at hiding this.The arts have been dealing with the subject of bad people forever, and have done a much better job of it than the psychiatrists have."
4,Good Book About a Difficult Subject,"Psychopaths and others with personality disorders are capable of spreading disorder in the workplace and poisoning relations amongst the workers. This makes understanding psychopaths and how to identify them key for human resource managers and others who have the ability to make personnel decisions. Keeping psychopaths out of the workplace is something that enhances labor harmony.Snakes in Suits is a good introduction on a subject that many management types find to be difficult dealing with. Only problem is that the book is written in an academic jargon that is often hard for those who did not progress in academia past their bachelor's degree to understand.Despite this drawback, Snakes in Suits is a must read for those who make personnel decisions in the workplace.As one quote from the book puts it, ""in the great card game of life, psychopaths know what cards you hold, and they cheat."" This book can help keep the cheaters out of your work environment."
3,a bit repetitive,"Had hoped for something a little more definitive, but found this to be a bit repetitive , and the general structure of the book hopping backwards and forwards tended to annoy me. Not Hervey Cleckley!!"
2,Redundant and repetitive,"...and repetitive and redundant. And padded, padded, padded. Interesting information, but it could have been covered in about 1/10 the space. I was expecting more meat about the psychopathic personality and less fluff about the fictitious(?) and poorly written, fractured narrative of Dave, Jack and Frank."
4,A must read for the business world,"I found this book to be really interesting and helpful. I only wish that it was a little longer. Unfortunatly, the truth is that we can all get better at recognizing a business pyschopath, but there is no real clear cut way to handle them. They all work differently, and there is no surefire way to handle each situation except leave. I will reccomend this book to all of my friends."
1,"Badly written, flat, bad characters...waste of time.",I'm too depressed to write a review of this awful book. That ought to let you know where I stand.
5,I love this book,"The book came to me from Bevinn Brien, Antiquarian Booksellers in Portland, ME, in about 3 days and is in perfect shape, better than advertised. But, most importantly, the book and images are wonderful. As a professional photographer, I am especially interested in the lighting used by Karsh. Having seen his work at the FMA in Boston, I needed more time to study each picture. The book was not available at the MFA bookstore nor would they back-order it. The images are never as good as the real print, but very close. I love the book and the service from Antiquarian. I am very happy with the transaction.Joe Turner, Photographerwww.JoeTurnerPhotography.com"
4,A MUST READ,"This is a well thought out book and quite provocative. Read it with an open mind and consider his arguments. The author is quite consistent in his use of scripture and doesn't avoid the ""hard"" passages. You should know that he has rewritten this book in a new and more recent updated edition that I don't see here on Amazon.Be careful. This book may revolutionize your relationship with GOd and your prayer life!"
5,God's way vs. Church legalism,Every adult and teen agers sitting in the pews of Christianity would benefit greatlyif they knew the precepts taught at Moultnoma School of the Bible which separatesthe demands of the Old Testament from the grace liberty that came by the IncarnateSon of God.
3,Throws Baby out with Bath Water,"I like Friesen. At least he's not afraid to think. And he's dead on right about the awful ways many people have abused, indeed, made a complete mockery of the issue of God's will. He cites some extreme, and extremely stupid, examples of people fabricating God's will or completely misunderstanding what God's will is all about. However, I see some problems with Friesen's declaration that, aside from his moral will, there is no preference in God's mind regarding the choices of His own. If you had four or five hours for discussion, I would develop the theological underpinnings of my argument. I believe the truth lies somewhere in between Friesen's position and the silly Christians who read ""God's will"" into every detail that occurs in their lives."
2,No stess indications!,"I really like my Langenscheidt Spanish dictionary, so when I started learning Italian I got a copy of this dictionary.I liked the size, layout, easy to read typeface, and durable cover. However, I quickly found it to be inadequate because it does not indicate the stressed syllable of the italian words. The stress in italian isn't always obvious, so this was a big problem when trying to determine the proper pronunciation of new words. Oddly, other sizes of the Langenscheidt Italian dictionaries do indicate stress, but I couldn't find one that was both compact and complete enough for me. So, I ended up returning this book and going with the Oxford Minidictionary instead."
3,Great for quick workouts- 3 1/2 stars,"She might not be the best choice for a workout video, but the short work out truly makes you sweat. Plus you feel your muscles really working. Susan Hyatt also says what you're thinking, and truly motivates you. Yes, it's not as polished as other workout videos, but it gets you're heart pumping!"
5,I love this book,This is a well written and exciting book. I love anything by Philippa Gregory and really enjoyed the Bolyn Trilogy. This is a must read for any book club. The detail and descriptions make you feel like you are back in old England hanging out at court. I have passed this book along to so many friends that it is starting to show it's wear. But we all agree that it's one of those rare books that you just love to read and talk about often.
3,Not Gregory's best...Kindle version has more than a few errors.,"I was very excited to read this book when I found it. I have read other Gregory works such as 'The Other Boelyn Girl' and 'The White Queen'. I was interested in reading more about Queen Elizabeth since I've read a lot about her father, Henry VIII. Without spoiling too much of the book, I will just say that I did not think Elizabeth's character should have been portrayed as weak and lovesick. She allowed men to rule her, when to my understanding she was supposed to be the most powerful female moniarch that ruled England. I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters. They were all flat and unrelatable. Also, the Kindle version is full of gramatical errors and Lizzie Oddingsell's brother's name was William, but got turned into David at one point. It became inconsistent at the end as if the editor stopped caring."
2,Won't even finish it,"I usually really like Philippa Gregory, but this book is awful. Like other reviewers, I can't tell who the main character is supposed to be. Elizabeth is remarkably silly and immature (a few times, her eyes have ""filled with tears"" during official meetings), and she keeps getting swept away by Robert Dudley for no identifiable reason except that he walks up to her and makes sexual innuendos. His wife Amy is one-dimensional and annoying. I'm very disappointed!"
5,another story from the GREATEST WRITER EVER! .,Philippa Greggory does NOT disappoint. just as riveting and exciting as her other books. I am a Philippa Gregory FAN! whatever she writes come to life. I could not put this book down. i often read 2 books at a time however this story captivated me so i put the other book down. I've ventured out for other writers who can do justice to the Tudor story line or other writers who focus on Monarchs and i've always been disappointed... like ALison Weir. She has let me down twice....i won't buy a 3rd book. but i own 5 novels by Philippa Gregory and no one catches me like she does.
2,Why does Dr. Gregory hate Elizabeth I?,"Historically there are controversies about all of the Tudor royals. Why does this author hate Elizabeth I so much? She portrays her alternately as a slut, a fool, a weak woman and finally as an evil, conniving person. This author has a hatred for both Elizabeth I and Anne Boleyn that I don't understand since in the historical record they were no worse than others around them. This biased view of history quite bothered me."
2,somewhat boring,"I have read all the books in this series re: Henry 8th and enjoyed all of them except this one. In spite of the history during this period of time, the reign of Elizabeth I, this book concentrates far too much on the sexual relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley as well as his whining wife, Amy. In terms of a synopsis, other reviewers have gone into depth but, again, the book is somewhat devoid of historical value. Gregory's theory about how Amy died is somewhat interesting but so much more could have been done with this time period. I actually came to despise the characters Dudley and Elizabeth. She is being portrayed as weak, Dudley obsessed, dumb and easily manipulated. As one of the greatest rulers in England, I found this characterization of her unbelievable and annoying."
1,"Oh, God, it burns!","When this book came out, I was excited. I heartily enjoyed Philippa Gregory's other Tudor novels, and I'm fascinated by Elizabeth I. I wish I had never read it.The characterizations of Elizabeth and Dudley and all the rest--blech! I was halfway through and I wanted to do nothing more than smack Elizabeth around for being a weak, empty headed IDIOT. The only thing she could do competently in this ""novel"" was bang Dudley. And don't get me started on Dudley. Oh please please PLEASE don't get me started.This was such a disappointment. I expected Gregory to be a bit hazy on the historical accuracy (hell, that's why it's called fiction) but to come up with this? It's absolute drivel. I'm so glad that all Gregory's other Tudor novels were better written and so much more engaging."
1,Don't Waste your Time,"This book isn't worth the money. It's not even worth the time to take it out of the library. Having read (and loved) her other books, I was really disappointed in this one. It's boring, petty and whiney. It reads more like a Barbara Cartland novel, than informative, historical fiction. I'm glad that I waited to get it at the local library because I would have been pretty ticked off if I had paid money for it."
2,I'm not a lover...,"of this book. It doesn't compare in entertainment value to The Other Boleyn Girl (the best) or The Queens Fool. It drags and then abruptly ends when the last 70 pages finally start to really move the plot. Oddly, the Authors Note at the end is more interesting than the book - although it runs right into her footnotes - be sure not to miss it."
1,Let down,I have read just about all of this collection. I actually was happy when I forgot it on the plane. I did not have to complete it.
2,"Bland Book, Disappointing Effort from Author","What a pity that Ms. Gregory had such a rich field to mine as the early life of Elizabeth I and in the end unearthed such an uninspiring book. After reading The Other Boleyn Girl I wanted to devour books about the period. This is definately my stopping point.The Virgin's Lover does not in any way do justice to the times in which it is set and seems, in fact, to be written for someone who has no knowledge of Fifteen century history. The main characters are poorly imagined, one dimensional people. The reader has a hard time imagining that this Elizabeth had one of the most successful reigns in British history. Why on earth would she have chosen such a transparently ambitious and ruthless lover and why would such a man inspire such devotion from an emotionally abused wife. In the end I couldn't find pity or compassion for any of the characters. But I did pity myself for expecting much more of this author.This was a most disappointing effort."
5,Robotic Kitty,My kids love the robotic kitty. Great price. Lots of laughts and enjoyment. I am very pleased with the product. THANKS
2,No Index,"In general, I enjoyed this historical work and found it informative. While it could get long-winded and focused too often on the minute details of personal politics, I did learn alot about the period and the character of the French nation that was very interesting. The biggest problem, as the title of the review said, is that in a 500 page history book with chapters that average 40 pages and no real breaking points, the lack of an index is a crucial flaw. I don't know how many times in the past year I've wanted to reference or check some of the information I found in Perkins' book. Unfortunately, with no index, it's virtually impossible. The book is essentially worthless for reference. I understand that it was written over 100 years ago and Perkins didn't include one. But this is a reprint. The reprinters should have created an index for the book."
1,Designed for a Lilliputian,"I purchased this to replace a smaller address book whose size I failed to check. I did not know that At-A-Glance made more than one size. I didn't return it because it was so inexpensive and myS/H would not have been worth it. Amazon must have added the 5 x 8 inches book since or I overlooked it. I went back again and found the 5 x 8 inches one. If any of you out there don't know what lilliputian means, it is a very small person. The space between lines is about half the space as my current (and shabby) At-A-Glance. Perhaps I have the one that is designed for the senior citizen but even the near sighted, in my opinion, could't handle it. Again, the price was too small to bother sending it back. I changed my mind and decided to return the book. I didn't realize the cost so I thought it was worth the trouble to pack it for a return. Having returned items to Amazon before I knew the drill."
3,The book is fine but less convenient as a stand alone.,"The book is fine, well organized. The reason that I gave it a 3 was that previously the address book was included with the calendar. That was much more convenient than having to carry around two separate books. The two books are more bulky than when they were combined."
3,Needed an old fashioned telelphone book,"THe book holds more than enough entry places and is a convenient size. Because the picture of it when ordering was difficult to see, I mistakenly assumed it was a refillable looseleaf book but it is not. Using it anyway and it works fine but if it gets filled, I will be more careful next time when ordering."
1,Tragic design flaw,"Just wanted to add another confirmation that this camera is mechanically flawed. The design of the control dial/shutter button assembly is horrendous (which you'll get to see for yourself once it breaks off if you buy this camera). Basically, when you turn the dial, you're exerting lots of pressure against 4 tiny plastic pins that hold the dial assembly together. In my case, the dial broke off just after the warranty expired. Having called around, it sounds like it'd be a minimum of $150 to fix it, including shipping. And even if it were fixed, I think its safe to assume it would break again in a year or so."
4,GREAT STARTER CAMERA,"The only thing I can say bad about this camera is the special battery that this camera uses (you'll have to special order a spare). The included software makes it easy to touch-up the beautiful pictures it takes. I upgraded mine to use a 128MB SmartMedia card so I can take over 130 full 1MB pictures that are always sharp and focused. I haven't had any problems with any buttons on mine and I've had it for almost two years now. If you don't know anything about digital cameras, I'm telling you right now, this is a no-brainer as a GREAT Starter Camera!!!"
3,Buy the Beautiful Mixtape Instead,"If you want to avoid the commercial sounding Beautiful Struggle, you should get the Beautiful Mixtape. Much more gritty and creative. Good music from the old Talib sound."
4,Not the Kweli I know...,"...but overall a pretty good album. No this is NOT Reflection Eternal, but it is worth listening to if you're a true hip-hop head. I also suggest that you cop the Beautiful Mixtape joint. That mixtape is crack yo !! Furthermore, the album has great production, and you know Kweli's lyrics are not to be messed with. I particularly liked the track "" I try "", produced by the great...yes I said "" The Great "" Kanye West. The song features Mary J. Blige singing to the soulful beat. Surprisingly...The Roc's Just Blaze produces a hot track "" Never Been In Love "". I say surprisingly because I didn't think JB's beat would mesh well with Kweli's lyrics, but I was mistaken. This is an album any true lover of hip-hop will certainly purchase and rock to the lyrical blessings of the kid Kweli."
1,Writing That Gives Romances A Bad Name,"I wish I had seen the previous review before I purchased this book. The plot starts as implausible and quickly becomes ridiculous. Coupled with the cliched writing, this is one of the worst romance novels I have ever read.I have read other Ann Major books and expected much more. Come on Ann, what happened?"
2,Be aware of the poor customer service before ordering,"I am using this product with a Intel iMac. Although I am generally satisfied with the hardware, the software has been somewhat buggy on my iMac. Miglia is apparently not supporting this phone. The last software version is in 2007. Two email requests for technical support went unanswered. Look at their website. There are no telephone numbers supplied whatsoever. I have never had good customer support from a vendor that insulates itself, as Miglia does, from the end user."
5,Tarzan,These movies are great. The pictures are so clear and refined. It seems as if they were just recently made.
5,Old time movies review,Tarzan characters are enjoyable an interesting to see. I have always like these movies specially with this cast of stars. Everything was done in such a way that showd an excellence in movie making
3,Pretty good,"Great buy. Really cheap. Only problem is I cant hit E. I should be able to get C,E,G,C, but I can not get the E.Other than that great for its price!"
2,Not very good,I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for anything to happen. Boring characters and a far fetched story line...or maybe so much has happened since the book was published that I just find the story unbelievable. I just didn't care what happened to anyone in this book.
5,it help me,This book will help u get to your stages u want to get to. Some of the tricks you have to do on bigger jumps because you have to get more air time but build up slowly on ramps and get into bigger tricks.You never know you might be in the x games or gravity games.
2,Only so-so,"I found this video contained not even the basics that was covered in 6th grade American history in public school. It has lots of star power; Katie Couric, George & Laura Bush, Chevy Chase, Whoopie Goldberg, Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, Robert Redford...the list goes on and on.But very limited substance.It would be a fair choice for someone from another country that hasn't been exposed to American history in school, but only fair.For more in-depth content, I suggest the Ken Burns PBS Civil War series and the History Channel Civil War Journal as much much better alternatives. I don't know for sure, but I'm sure other History Channel and similar productions have terrific content on the American Revolution. In fact I'm here right now to seek some out!Fighting for Freedom: Revolutionary & Civil War is only a couple of hours long, so not much can be expected from it."
1,Not*about Meryl Streep,"This is not about a Meryl Streep profile, it is about a famous?? but boring play that only a few snippets of which are shown. Meryl is seen in a few of the rehearsals.The entire DVD resembles an after work get-together. Couldn't wait to throw it in the trash....I do like Meryl Streep as a a great actress."
2,Disappointment,"Surprised and happy when I opened the package to find 5 bulbs rather than 3. Disappointed when only 2 grew and are not fairing well. Other plants are doing fine, but perhaps the problem is lack of detail in growing the water cannas in a pond."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.,This is a total waste of money. Do you not purchase this item. It is not what you think it is. Don't waste your money.
3,Strange collection of stories,"Adult black and white graphic novel.A series of short stories (""Medical Records"") involving a ""sexual healing"" clinic, specifically involving the male Dr. Ogekuri and female Nurse Ruko. Apparently the fourth volume in the series, though haven't read the previous books.Interesting scenes, minimal plot. Well-drawn characters with some censoring. Stories include: 1: a man that can only enjoy sex if he is in costume as a superhero; 2: a birthday party for the nurse; 3: an impotent man; 4: ""the battle of the sexes""; 5: a ""woman"" worried about ""her"" huge breasts; 6: the nurse's biggest fan; 7: ""paying the rent""; 8: ""leather complex""; 9: an evil rival sex therapist; 10: ""scared of Christmas night""; 11: ""new year's present""; 12: a man that fears ""going down"" on a woman; 13: ""masturbation syndrome""; and 14: loving your sister too much. An ok collection of scenes."
1,garbage,"the point and click moving is old, the graphics ..., it takes too long to play, i reccomend you don't even rent this game"
5,Not Too Bad...,"I ordered this ring because my wedding ring was too small for my pregnant fingers, and I wanted something to wear until they shrink back down to size. It really looks great, and is certainly worth the $15. The diamond isn't too big and it does not strike me as particularly outlandish."
3,Expect the Impossible!,"In the black-and-white, pen-and-ink world of classic Felix anything could happen and frequently did. Otto Messmer's Felix the Cat cartoons were known for their surreralism and this collection is a fine example.In these episodes Felix is expressive and appealing. The cartoons are loaded with the morphing images and visual tricks which made Felix the most popular cartoon character of the 1920s and are still entertaining today.The simplicity of the backgrounds and supporting characters enhance Felix's presence on the screen and add to the surreal atmosphere of the cartoons.The cartoons were made during the silent era and have added music and sound effects (not always synchronized and sometimes annoying) from theatrical rereleases and early television distribution.This DVD collection is easily affordable and would serve as a good introduction to classic Felix and the imaginative artistry of Otto Messmer."
2,not as expected...,"Works well, but not ""dedicated"" to the Sony Cybershot T30 as requested. Photo did not truly reveal that product was for multi-battery charging.Definitely not ""original equipment"", although a fairly good product."
2,Not worthy of the Panavise name,"If you're looking for a PCB vise, save up and get the more expensive Panavise with a metal base. This thing is more trouble than it's worth.Pros:--Heat-resistant vise grips with nice grooves that hold on to a PCB--Articulation works well and feels sturdyCons:--Jaw threading is stiff and difficult to operate--Jaw handle is small and uncomfortable to turn more than fine adjustments--The suction cup base does not stay down, even on a very even non-porous surfaceI could forgive the suction cup, since I could do something like glue it down, but the vice jaws are too difficult to open and shut due to the combination of the stiff threads and crappy adjustment handle."
3,Mediocore to fair,"I have read most of this book. I have kind of lost interest. I was under whelmed by the book. It is a bit out of date but 99% of the information is still good. This is not a bad book. I did not find errors. However, the author did not go into any real depth on methodologies for attacking problems. He never discussed when to use which tools. He just stitched together a bunch of getting started documents. The book should have had fewer subtopic (i.e. you don't really need to talk about a bunch of memory checkers 1 or 2 would have been fine) and then go into detail with some real world examples not ""hello-world"".I recommend that a potential reader borrow this book from someone and skim it. Don't buy it"
2,Too little info on Santa Fe,"I felt the book left out several key points on what the traveler should know when visiting Santa Fe. 1. Most restraunts close from 3-5:30 each day and close for the day at 9:30. Our first night in Santa Fe this turned out to be a disappointment when we tried to go out to dinner after 9:00 PM. 2. There was very little info on the best ways to enjoy the natural beauty of New Mexico while in Santa Fe. We had to seek the guidance of our hotel when looking for the best areas to hike. 3. Overall the book simply tried to cover too much info about the entire state of New Mexico in it's relatively limited text and fell short on the critical info for Santa Fe. 4. Inadequate number of restraunts covered and reviewed. In fact, the best restraunt we dined in (The Bull Ring) wasn't even mentioned. 5. No photographs."
4,For PC Users,"I didn't get too far into the book before I realized that it was for PC users. I know the formats a quite similar, but what can I say, I'm spoiled by books written either exclusively for Macs or at least, ones that cover both formats. Just be aware when you're looking to purchase that you take this into account."
5,great find,I had trouble finding this item for an aged aunt. I appreciate being able to ship it so quickly to her house.
2,Cheap Faucet could flood your house,I would rate the product much higher if it didn't almost flood my house. The plastic fitting on bottom of the faucet broke off an hour after installing it. Water was just free flowing under my sink. Luckily the sound of water pouring out on my kitchen floor was enough to wake me up after only a couple of minutes of flooding.They didn't question it when I called and said they would send another fitting. I'm worried that it will break again and considering buying another faucet. That looks like it will cost another $30-$40!
3,Water doesn't taste great...,"I ordered this filter to replace a reverse osmosis water filter. The reverse osmosis filter produced delicious water but was very expensive to operate and did not produce as much water as we needed. I bought this particular filter after doing a lot of research on the web as to effectiveness of removing chemicals and particulates from tap water. I am assuming that the studies I read accurately reflect the efficacy of this filter, but the water it produces just doesn't taste great. To produce good tasting water we are running the water from the Culligan thru a Brita. On the positive side, we have no issues with the faucet that we received as some reviewers have. It's not the BEST I've ever seen, so maybe if you had kids that were harder on the faucet, it would break. But so far, it has functioned perfectly well for my husband and me."
1,Disastrous consequences of this product,"We had a professional plumber install this water filter. After 12 days of working properly, the water line that was included in the package simply popped out of the filter-head, and when I awoke at 5 a.m., I waded water through my kitchen, breakfast room, laundry room, half-bath, and garage. It took us over 2 hours with a high-powered shop vac to get the lake drained. I don't know yet if the wood floor in living room is going to come loose from concrete slab. How can an established and reputable company like Culligan make and sell such a poorly designed unit? If I don't sue them, somebody else will, I'm sure!"
5,Water Filter Review,"This system replaced a PUR water filter we had previously installed under-sink. The Culligan system is great, perfectly replaced the other system and seems to work better at a more economical price."
2,Same ole same ole,Just another book on how to loose weight and eat right. Recommend getting a trainer instead of reading the book if you really want to get results.
5,Thought Provoking,"I saw this special last night on The History Channel and I found it to be extremelyyyy well done.I loved how they used a lot of real footage shot during the time.I found the special to be extremely shocking, thought provoking and actually eerie.They really put The Third Reich into perspective for me and I learned a lot watching the show.Highly recommend."
4,A Story That Should be Remembered,"This is a good history from a German point of view. It has parallels to today, for when tyranny is not halted and the populace only listens to politicians' words and ignores the consequences of actions the world suffers dire consequences. It is entertaining and tells the story of Hitler and that time period very well."
2,Some good unseen footage from Nazi period misused for propaganda purposes.,"It is a shame that the good footage shown in this documentary (in parts) couldnt have been used in a more objective, academic documentary ..but instead the History Channel has created another propaganda film to make the Nazis and Germans seem like they were some Satanic cult instead of a political party of 1930's Germany.There are a lot of ""what is this doing in the documentary?"" moments..and really if you do buy this..you might just want to turn the sound down and just watch what footage there is to watch inside this ""documentary"" ."
5,Every song is a classic,Acoustic Tull is a must. Even if you're not a die hard fan u will love it.Ian Anderson and the band truly do belong in the hall of fame.
3,HMP-12P do not equal EMP-15P pads,"EMP-15P pads are 2-1/2"" HMP-12P are just shy of 3-1/4""I didn't see sizes in any of the descriptions of these mineral pads and there was a reference for the EMP-15P pads that seemed to indicate an equivalence to the HMP-12P pads. They aren't the same size.There you have it, my sacrifice (cause it's not worth shipping them back) is our gain in knowledge!I imagine they can be cut down."
1,Advertising Wrong,"I ordered these pads, thinking they would fit in my Vicks Humidifier, which is the exact humidifier they advertise you to buy with these pads. When I received them, the box doesn't even say they work on a Vicks product and they are way too big. I say these are falsely advertised. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them!"
5,Mineral Pad,"It seems to work well and there's no fuss or mess. Just add it to the vaporizer and it's ready to go. I think you need to have these pads in order for the vaporizer to work properly, but overall, a good buy."
1,No Steps Forward,"I am a longtime fan of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and I must say I am disappointed in this supposed sequel. It offers absolutely nothing that TTD doesn't have and in at least one way (i.e., the way of building tracks and roads) is a very frustrating step back. If you have TTD, don't even consider this. Instead look at openTTD, a free game (you must have the TTD for windows disk to install). If you don't have TTD and can't get it, I guess you won't know what you are missing, so I suppose you can get Locomotion. But if you fall into this category, and you find yourself playing locomotion and saying, ""Why didn't the programmer do it this way?"" know that the answer is he did do it that way, 10 years ago. This is a downgrade from TTD and I will never play this game as long as I have openTTD. A clear lack of effort on the part of Chris Sawyer."
5,Historical and literary background on Tel Aviv,"If you want to understand Tel Aviv's dynamic, its history, its architecture, and the models its founders had in mind, this is a very nice book. It's well written and well researched."
4,Dated but Still GREAT,"This is by and large yet another outstanding Queen product. This covers the Eighties portion of their career and I am sorry to say it shows. I was aghast at how dated many of this videos are! The worst offendors are Invisible Man, A Kind of Magic, and anything associated with Hot Space. The extras were fun, though the Montreux performance is horrid! I really enjoyed the Munich Freddie interview in its entirety. Sure, much of this has been seen before but not on dvd. Video highlights are ""Who Want to Live Forever,"" the hilarious ""I Want to Break Free,"" and my hidden gem, ""Scandal."" The defiance and sensuality displayed by Freddie in this one is incredible.All hardcore Queen fans need this DVD!Now it's time for the Innuendo material, the Night at the Opera 30th anniversary dvd, and (please?!) Live at the Rainbow 1974!"
5,No SAHM should be without this book!,"Cheryl Gochnauer does it again. Her insight into the life of a stay-at-home mom shines through this book in so many ways. There isn't a facet she doesn't touch on, whether it's finances, helping other moms who are struggling (being their Godsend), keeping your sanity through those long days, school cancellations woes, and overcoming the need to ""do it all.""There's a foreword by Dr. Laura Schlessinger that sheds a VERY interesting light on a stay-at-home vs. working-outside-the-home lifestyle.This book should be on the bookshelf of every parent...."
3,Pretty but Overpriced; Shoddy Workmanship,"I looked all over for something pretty to cover my cats' jumbo litter pan, and this product -- though expensive -- was the best I could find. It looks the way I expected it to (i.e., as described -- not bad, better than a standard litter box), but the latch on the front panel does not stay closed, so I had to wire it shut myself, which is a pain in the neck each time I want to open it for cleaning. My largest (20-lb.) cat scared himself silly the first time he used it, because the front panel flopped open when he tried to go inside, and he was afraid to use it for a while. I'm keeping it because it's too much of a nuisance to return it, but for this price the workmanship should be much better. And for the record, the first time I ordered this product (from the company), the wrong color was shipped to me. I wouldn't purchase anything from this company (Mr. Herzher) again."
1,Poorly engineered Litter Pan Cover,I am disappointed with the product. It is unraveling at top of front panel where it latches. It was also SOOOOO HARD to put the metal legs into the rubber pegs. The holes in the pegs are too small. I had to enlarge them a bit with a screw driver. I wish I had my money back!
3,Too difficult.,"This toy has to be lined up exactly to work, and then you have to avoid bumping any of the alarms. (besides being terribly easy to spot). The squirt bottle is a bad idea...it just gets everything wet and young children don't know not to spray it too close to the toy. My cousin only wanted to spray the water while the adults tried to get the darn thing to work. We are fans of the little dome motion detectors..they work great! Buy several of those and skip this silly tripwire one."
4,Mom in PA,Fun toy. My boys love to set it up across the doorway to their room and trap me when I walk in. We had a little trouble getting the 3rd unit set up but works well with two and they seem to enjoy it alot.
3,"Nice, but ...","I was pleased with the earrings ... those I received were slightly over 1cttw, F & H color, and VS2. Nice, but not an excellent match for a pair.So, I did have some questions about the order & what I received. I contacted CS, only to be referred to the jewelry department, and I waited ... and waited ... for a response. Then, I received some snarly comments that did not even address my questions & concerns.This was not my first purchase from Amazon jewelry, but it was my last. I am back to working with local B&M; jewelers with live, thoughtful human beings. And price-wise, I'm probably doing better ... it was just the convenience & selection online that was so impressive. I'm simply tired of not getting answers to legitimate questions ... and I don't need to put up with being treated like crap when I'm making 4-figure purchases.Adios, Amazon jewelry department!"
3,The audience of this book are PhD mathematicians and physicists,"Penrose condenses advanced graduate level math courses into approximately 20 page chapters. Complex analysis, Fiber Bundles, Differential Geometry, Group Theory are some examples. You'd have to be a math PhD to master these subjects and to cover them in a span of a few hundred pages is an impossible gap of logic and mathematical rigor to bridge.The 2nd half of the book covers physics and is much the same way with advanced graduate level topics like Quantum Field Theory, SuperSymmetry, String Theory and Twistor Theory condensed into small chapters.Frankly, this book would be a complete waste of time and money for the layperson. I'd venture to say professional physicists and mathematicians would not fare much better as each would be confounded by at least half the book."
2,A fatally flawed book,"It is amazing: the reviews center on the quality of the mathematical/physics presentation (which I think is very high), and totally ignore the fact that this, like virtually all books written in this vein, is supremely naive about fundamental philosophical issues. What I mean, briefly, is this: the book is predicated on an unstated, rigidly held Cartesian dualism, and for dealing with fundamental questions that is a very suspect ground--an expression of what the philosopher Lawrence Cahoone calls ""philosophical narcissism."" For an antidote, I highly recommend Cahoone's ""The Dilemma of Modernity"" (SUNY, 1988), or, immodestly, my own ""The Unboundaried Self: Putting the Person Back Into the View From Nowhere"", published by Trafford (2005; Details at [...])."
5,Super Deal,"Price was so good I thought there would be a catch, but no everything is as stated and arrived quick. Great place to shop for sure"
2,Altec Lansing XM3120 ($16.95) is another option,"Amazon sells the Altec Lansing XM3120 for 16.95.This unit works with skyfi3 (use the included Roady XT adapter) but, the volume adjustment knob on the XM3120 will NOT work with the SKYFi3. To adjust volume, use the volume controls on the side of the SKYFi3, or the SKYFi3's remote control.The skyfi3 radios may also work with Roady XT home kits, but I haven't looked into this.I ordered the Altec Lansing XM3120 yesterday; I like this unit better than any home kit.New comment: I just received the Altec Lansing unit, and its volume knob WORKS. To change the volume you can use this knob, or the skifi3 remote control (or the radio volume)."
4,A fun read,"Interesting, well-rounded characters and a compelling story line. Would love to be able to use the free wheeling mode of transportation found on Cady's home planet. This book stands alone as a complete story but sets things up well for following Cadence Drake on future adventures. If you are looking for a read to draw you in and transport you to a world of adventure get this book."
2,Misrepresents the dominant muslim thought,"This is a brave attempt by the author to address one of the thorniest issue among the world Muslim population, but the author takes a very partisan view of Muslim community in US. The discussions never really touch upon the fundemental conflict within Islam. Islamic teaching and principles are not analyzed in the light of current socio-economic meileu, but instead glossed over. The author could have done a much better job of enlightining the world about inherent conflicts in Koran, and the different interpretation of it. However, he protrays a west-friendly picture, so that it is palatable to the west , but is largely out of sync with fundemental muslim thinking."
1,"This is the STUDY GUIDE, not the text book!","This is the STUDY GUIDE, not the text book. I was really peeved when it came in the mail and I realized all I had was a paper thin study guide, which was supposed to help me take tests on the text book. Don't make the mistake I did, get the text book, not the STUDY GUIDE!"
1,Shock,"Today I've found in my mail the Study Guide for Benett & Hess's Criminal Investigation. It was a shock! It is the first time in my life I see an empty book. It seems a copybook. The text too, is very poor of information. Is completely useless. It was un error to buy it. I was convinced to buy a textbook. This was an error of mine, probability because the reviews of the workbook are mixed with those of the textbook and the average is calculated using all of them (I hope this happened by error). Pay attention. By the way, I've found an use for the mine: I've put it under the short leg of the shelf in my attic. Who said that it is an useless book."
3,quick and dirty saves the day.,"This book, although dated, is a must have for an apache admin.A first time apache admin? Not so much. But if you have a general grasp, and you've read the apache documentation, this serves as a good reference. If you want to jump in and look at something really quick, it works great.The information is fairly accurate, but the writing leaves much to be desired. If you are new to apache, you'll likely get confused if you follow this. But if you start getting some experience and want to tweak it and play around, or if something is broke, keep the book handy."
4,Battle Tanx Global Assault Review,"If you like blowing stuff up, this game is for you. Besides the lame storyline, this game is simply fun to pay. Who cares about the story anyway when you have a tank, lots of guns, and a licence burn, smash, and blow uo anything you want!"
3,Long duration outlasts entertainment value,"I watched this series on Encore, and quite enjoyed the first half of the series. Unfortunately, with few exceptions the major characters are not developed further after the first few episodes, and do not display any significant growth or change thereafter. There is only enough plot to carry this through six to eight episodes, so the last three episodes in particular feel like an overlong buildup to an anticlimactic end. The series is also choppily edited, and the writing is very predictable. You can tell exactly when each scene is going to be cut just before it gets there."
1,Wrong size battery for lumix dmc-zs1,Bought this like the others because it was bundled as recommended when I bought my lumix dmc-zs1 but it's too big. I had find the correct size thru the Panasonic site and then further have it link back to Amazon.
2,Poor Condition,"I purchased ""Fairways: America's Greatest Golf Resorts"" for a friend who plans on spending his retirement golfing. I purchased the book in June and when I went to unbox and wrap it today for our gathering next week, I found it's in bad condition, with the book jacket edges having some ravels and marks on its shiny top surface! I've never had a problem with Amazon books before when purchasing for gifts. It's been three months since my purchase and I no longer can return it so will have to do something else quickly. I'm disappointed because the book content was so lovely."
1,No good,"This product is not suitable for nikon dx40 or maybe I receive it broken, but the autofocus does not work with the camera"
3,On John's behalf,"In defense of the review by J. Randall Groves, I would like to say that I have heard John many times and the tone he uses works much better live. Be that as it may, a musicians ""sound"" has so much more to do with the player, and less to do with the equipment. If anyone else picked up Pat Metheny's guitar it wouldn't sound like him. It's the same with Stowell or any good musician. If the sound of the guitar bothers you, listen to the sound of the player. In spite of his dark guitar tone, John is a fantastic musician, one of the most unique guitarists I've witnessed, and one of my favorites. Check him out. ...and if anyone cares, Stowell deos not use a solidbody electric as stated by Groves. He uses a custom made hollow electric (flat top, not arched) and a custom made nylon string with similar consruction. (Neither have any sound holes)"
3,"Decent, but not great quality","I've bought a couple cases of this paint over the last summer. I'm not sure if it happened to be my cases or the paint in general, but a very large percentage of paintballs had dimples straight out of the box. Of the samples I took, about 50% had small to significant dimples. I'm not sure if the distributer had them sitting for a long time or what, but but that's not the quality that I like.Another thing to note is that these balls run pretty small. If your ball detent is broken or balls get into your barrel, they will roll out on their own. This may be different with your barrel, but something to keep in mind. They didn't break in my gun and I was very satisfied with the good balls. You could definitely tell which shots had dimples since they curved quite a bit."
5,Tour de France is Tour de Force,"Great. If you're a Kraftwerk fan, there is no reason in the world that you wouldn't be thrilled with this comback album. It's as good as anything they've ever done and such a thrill to be able to get something new from these guys. I've been buying their music since they began in the early 70's and this shouldn't be missed. It's Kraftwerk all the way thru and there isn't a dog in the bunch. Excellent. A+++++"
3,"Not the best, but...","It's still Kraftwerk, even though they seem to have devolved to a point where their music becomes too typically techno. If you haven't heard Kraftwerk before, I wouldn't recommend buying this album unless you're a big techno fan. For the Kraftwerk fan, I would still recommend buying it if you've enjoyed their earlier releases, such as Electric Cafe and Computer World although Tour De France Soundtracks doesn't even come close to the brilliance of those two albums."
4,"Not the typical, i guess...","FINALLY, there's fairly decent book about an unlucky kid. It's not a girl who finds out she's a princess, not a high school boy who's crush happends to fall in love with him, not a poor family that suddenly wins the lottery. It's about a spoiled rich kid who gets a taste of what life is like when money doesn't grow on trees.It was a great book, I thought that Alfie was a little ""much"" at times, not a likely person to meet. But, I did like the feeling the book gave after you were done with it that made you glad you had ""something."""
4,Great Product,"This is my second H2O ipod housing. I found small drops of water inside the case during the 30 minute dunk test on the first one. Amazon took it back, no questions asked, so I decided to try again. My ipod is an 80G Classic so this is not exactly the right case but the ear jack lines up perfectly with my ipod and most of the buttons work so I'm happy. I think H2O Audio makes a universal underwater case for ipods and MP3 players so that might be the way to go if you you're not comfortable tweaking with your product a little. I put tissue in the bottom of my case to make sure the ipod stays tight against the jack and I can extend the buttons inside the case a little if I need to. I also bought the H2O Audio Surge Pro mini earphones too. One ear of my Sony's would crap out whenever I was out for a run and started sweating, but these work great even underwater. And they make swimming laps a lot more enjoyable. All in all a great product that I didn't even know existed a few months ago."
4,Good Travel Buddy,"I purchased my Medicool insulin protector when I was diagnosed with Type 1 back in April of 1993 and I've had the same one since then. It has traveled all over the world with me, including trips to France, Hawaii, and all over the Caribbean. Throughout, it has been a tough traveler, keeping my insulin cool in the summer, and temp stable in cold weather. I keep thinking that I should get another one, but mine still looks new and does it's job, every time I travel. :>)"
3,"great atmosphere and detail, lousy characters and plot","While the author has obviously done a great deal of research and painstakingly recreated an interesting historical period, ultimately one is uninterested in the characters and praying for the thing to please please end.This was a tortuous, thrilling and exhausting trip into a Dickensian world populated by a multitude of characters acting almost exclusively out of self-interest. There are many characters here, none of them pleasant -- the protagonist's mother is one of the most annoyingly weak characters I've ever encountered on a page -- and many with similar names. One key character has a complete and irrational reversal of motive and action at the end of the book, and the ending is lame, particularly considering that the reader has invested the time and energy to slog through over 800 pages of text.Unless you are a glutton for punishment, do yourself a favor and reread Dickens or Conan Doyle instead. Vastly overrated."
1,Unbearable,"I just want to assure readers, that if you get a few hundred pages into this dog and feel like you've invested too much time to quit, you are wrong. The ending does not redeem this interminable mess, but will only leave you more frustrated. So after 200, 400, 600, even 800 pages into it, you will still gain a few hours on your life if you just walk away. Yes, take it from one who did finish, it is that bad. Would that I could get those hours back and invest them in ANYthing else.Understand, I am not uneducated, nor am I shy of long books (recent reads include The Stand, Pillars of the Earth and Atlas Shrugged) I've read War and Peace, I can even follow along in Umberto Eco's books, but this book promises only to frustrate and confuse. Don't even start it, but if you already have, do yourself a favor and quit now. You can never get the time back."
2,I'm too dumb,"Another book I was too dumb to follow. The plot twists and turns, crosses back on itself, and there are a million characters, half of whom are related to each other. I tried to take notes, as another reviewer had suggested, but I gave up on that. Felt too much like school work! I almost abandoned the book at about page 400 but decided to plow on. I wouldn't say this was a terrible book, but it's one that I won't keep and won't recommend to anyone."
2,Does it ever end?,"As some other reviewers had done, I bought this book many years ago and only recently picked it up and began reading. It took me a couple of weeks to get through it and I must say that whereas the depiction of character and scene is quite remarkable I felt that the book would never end. Not because of the length of the book (although quite considerable) but due to the fact that every time you thought a conclusion was being reached the main character was yet again captured, beaten, trapped, etc..., It reminded me of the time many years ago when I tried watching a soap opera during lunch with my wife and after 2 weeks I was driven nuts by the fact that there was never a resolution to any of the vignettes. It just went on and on and on....,"
2,If you like dumb hero's,"What kind of masterpiece is this supposed to be? Psuedo-Dickensonian language that drags you down like old mud. The ""colorful"" characters are all steriotypes: pure good or pure evil, (or pure dumb in the case of the hero), drawn from some 19th century grab bag. And the plot ... god I hate plots that rely upon the endless stupidity of their protaganist to drive them onward.The plot ... nothing happens except in responce to some idiotic action by the main character. If the man, (well kid ... I admit that I could not stick it out enough pages for the little brat to grow up) had the sense and self preservation instinct of an intelligent spaniel there would be no story."
2,Non-stick coating burned off and stuck to pizza,"I really want to like this - I think I had the heat a little to high on my grill (grill thermo read 475, grill grates were closer to 650). My first use the nonstick coating stuck to my pizza and came off the pan - ruined pizza- ruined pan. very disappointing. I'll probably get an uncoated pizza pan to use on the heat shield since teflon on a grill seems like a bad idea anyway."
5,Pizza on the Grill,We love this product! We bought 4 to give as Christmas presents. We use Mama Mia's pre-made pizza crust and build what we like on the crust. Pizza's are crispy and cooked all the way through without burning.
1,Non-stick. I don't think so.,"I received this pan as a Christmas gift. I finally got around to trying it out last night. I was pretty excited about it because I'd heard how great grilled pizza tastes. Unfortunatly I still don't know if that's true. My pizza stuck to the non-stick surface. As I was trying to pry the crust off the pan I noticed the non-stick surface had actually come off the pan and was stuck to my crust. Threw the pizza, pan and all, in the trash as I'm sure eating that wouldn't be good idea at all. I'll most likely continue to use the base for future pizzas but will purchase a stainless pan or pizza stone."
4,In Defense of the Faith,"Dave Hunt writes in a no nonsense style trying to show the Bible contains passages,words and stories that if followed will allow you to exercise a life of peacefulness and harmony with our creator(don't shortchange yourself by not studying Gods word yet giving an opinion on how untrue you feel it is)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This is a collection of very old videos thrown together on a DVD.I had two of the videos. That is really bad. Also, the dances were not listed with each decade. I question where they got the dances. There were so many popular ones I wanted to learn that were missing. Not recommended."
1,WARNING My filter split and flooded my house.,The bottom of my RC-EZ-4 split while I was on vacation and flooded my house.
1,Too Many Errors to be Useful,"I bought this book for its value as a ""quick read"" of UML 2.0, and as prep for the OMG UML Certification.I'm just on Chapter 1, and have found so many glaring errors so far that I suspect everything in the book has to be carefully read and re-read to identify the errors.Examples: page 12 - the definitions for ""precondition: and ""postcondition"" are EXACTLY the same. Page 17 - the graphic does not support the text that the notation for aggregation and composition are different. I suspect that the book was rushed to publication without adequate proofreading, which is too bad because, other than the errors, it's very consice and read-able."
3,Just so-so,Interesting reading about the author's year on the road. Disappointed that it was not all oriiginal writing. Mostly a collection of their printed news paper. Articles mentioned as being included in news paper were missing from the book.
3,Where's the rest of the music?,"This soundtrack is good- funky, upbeat, and well-rounded-not to mention ambitious for a Disney movie. The original tracks performed by Miss Lohan are a special treat. But this soundtrack does leave something to be desired... namely, several artists that are used in the movie but that are not included in the soundtrack, the standout example being the Flaming Lips. Had these artists been inluded, the soundtrack would have truly done the movie justice. Otherwise, it is fun yet a bit disappointing."
5,Freaky Friday Is awesome!!!,"hey,I got the CD for Christmas, It rules! Some favorites on the CD are:*Ultimate*What I like about you*Take me away*Hit me baby (one more time)-Chad Micheal Murray intro*Fortune Cookie?Get the CD it will Blow your mind!"
1,stupid stupid stupid,it is so bad...i only like 1 song it is cool but the others are stupid dont buy it
4,A cool Movie for Mom & Daughter's,I took my daughter to see the movie & it was one of the best bonding experiences for both of us. I just bought it for her as a x-mas gift & now I am giving her the cd.
3,freaky friday review,"1.""Ultimate"" Lindsay Lohan 10/102.""Happy Together"" Simple Plan 10/103.""What I Like About You"" Lillix 10/104.""The Art Of Losing"" American Hi-Fi 10/105.""Brand New Day"" Forty Foot Echo 4/106.""Me Vs.

Rolfe Kent 1/10"
1,Bad Language,"My pre-teen and teenage children enjoyed the movie; they wanted the soundtrack. As is our family policy, my husband and I reviewed the lyrics online before purchasing the CD. We were shocked to find that the second song on the CD contained the so-called R-rated swear word (the F word). We wondered if other parents even know that this is in a CD marketed to very young consumers and the viewers of a ""family"" film. Our daughter was sad that she will miss the other great music on this CD but agrees that we cannot support media that is in conflict with our values.Parents be aware."
4,pretty good. Yes,"This was a very good album. My definate favorite songs are: Ultimate- Lindsay Lohan, What I like about about you- Lillix, and Me vs. the world- Halo Friendlies. I like all of the other songs too- except for Ashlee Simpson's "" Just let me cry"". But these are my definate faves."
1,"The last reviewer was wrong,.","I believe that the last reviewer is sadly mistaken. There are no obscene or profain words in any of the songs on this CD. You must have this soundtrack confused with the soundtrack from some other movie. If there had been and foul language anywhere on this CD, it would have had a Parental Advicary label on the cover of the CD. There isn't one on this CD.AS for the music itself, I've heard better, and I've heard worse. Some of the songs are good (like ""Ultimate"", What I Like About You"" ""Happy Together"", and ""What A Wonderful World""), while others aren't that good (the other songs on this soundtrack). If you're a fan of some of the groups on this CD, then you might want to get this one for your collection. If you're like me, and only care for a few of the artists on the soundtrack, I'd skip this CD."
3,not willeford's best...,"Although the book is well written, Willeford is not really suited to writing about pure losers. he does much better with con men, cops and obssessives."
2,What a let down/disappointment this film was!,"The White Dragon was such a disappointment when compared to the modern marvels of Chinese cinema such as Seven Swords, The Emperor and the Assassin, The House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Hero, among others!Apart from Cecilia Cheung (who is GORGEOUS!!!) and the lovely colors seen throughout the film, the plot and the dialogues are poor at best.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...No masterpiece here."
3,Campy Kung Fu Movie,"This movie is not your ordinary kung fu action movie. It is a little ""campy"" in that it does not try to be realistic at all. One scene has an old lady ""downloading"" her powers to a younger woman and a Microsoft Windows 95-like icon appears as the powers transfer from one to the other. If you are looking for kung fu action, this is not it, but if you are looking for fun, you might like this one."
3,Pretty Good,"Fun movie, has some wire-fu. Decent fight scenes. Story line is sort of weak and kind of cheesy."
4,Errol Flynn Classic Film Collection,I am a fan of older classic films and stars.All four films in this collection I enjoyedand will continue to enjoy for many years.
4,The action and adventure never stops with this pack,"Four great movies to keep you watching. Can't go wrong with Errol Flynn on the giving end of a sword. He will steal you loot and steal your girl, and you'll enjoy every minute of it."
4,In the Realms of the Unreal,"""KimJongilia"" is a documentary about North Korea produced by Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas,The Browning Version) and while Figgis is more well-known for his movie about an alcoholic Nicolas Cage spending his final days in Las Vegas, this is his hidden masterpiece. ""Kimjongilia"" is composed of interviews with real heroes- those who have escaped North Korea and are brave in denouncing the tyrannical regime. Forget Superman, Batman, or the Avengers- these people have lived in harrowing circumstances. One survivor was born in the ominously named ""Total Control Camp""-another was imprisoned because her friend was a lover of Kim Jong-Il and knew the pillow talk. One survivor found spiritual sustenance in literature likeAnna Karenina,Resurrection (Oxford World's Classics), and was inspired byThe Count of Monte Cristoto escape. While the interpretive dancing segments are jarring, the overall narrative is powerful. These are stories of true heroism and faith."
3,"Good level, but not as good as it used to be.","I have had one of these levels for many years. Good service, but recently while I was working I allowed it to fall over and one end broke off. I ordered a new one due to my previous satisfaction. However, the current model no longer has a rule inscribed on the edge, even though the description above says that it does. This is a disappointment and will limit the functionality that I used to use the level for."
4,great for longer wrenches,"I bought a bucket boss wrench roll back when sears sold them, it is canvas of a good grade and is still serving me fine. this wrench roll is not canvas, it is a synthetic weave and fells cheaper, while it is doing the job and may last as long as my first bucket boss is seems cheaper in the cloth. the one big advantage is it has very deep pockets which are great for my Snap-on and Craftsman pro wrenches, actually the pockets will be too deep for normal Craftsman wrenches and the end will be sunken down out of sight. This product still is 100 times better than that cheapo wrench roll sold by sears under the craftsman name now. (with the plastic buckles that fail very soon and leave nothing for the velcro to grab."
4,Good quality wrench bag,"I needed a roll up bag for my wrenches and these were exactly the ones I needed. Yes they are too deep for standard size wrenches. I have some Matco (long-version) wrenches and they almost get swallowed up by the pocket. Those who don't have long wrenches will be disappointed. On the plus side, the quality seems to be good but I was hoping I could secure the bag using velcro instead of the tie. I'll most likely sew on some velcro."
3,Wrenches,Things are made as they used to be. This looks like it is out of a ripstop fabric but the old one just to be out of a green fabric and I know ripstop is great but it just does not look mate is well and now they are imported instead of made in USA.
3,OK Performance,"The performance is OK. Certainly not as good as Riverdance show of several years ago. Ther cast is not as large as it used to be, and the vocal renditions are nice, but detract from the raisond'etre of Irish Dancing. But OK overall."
1,Are you learning c++?,"Stay. Away. From. This. Book.This book covers a great deal very quickly, and does so in an easy-to-understand way. Unfortunately, it is riddled with novice programming mistakes, has a poor and unmaintainable programming style, and displays many of the things that are widely considered to be ""worst practise"" in C++ programming. The coverage of the STL is poor and its proper use is not encouraged as it should be. I'm glad I never had the misfortune of ever having bought it. There are many, many other books that cover C++, and nearly all of them cover it better.If you're looking for a good book to learn C++, buy anything but this one. It is by far the worst O'Reilly book ever released, and I'm amazed that such poor code quality was ever approved by the editorial staff."
3,"Promises much, delivers only slightly less","I started this book with the knowledge that Holmes pastiches are often less than satisfying. I was pleasantly surprised by the plot and the faithfulness of the author to the characters of Holmes and Watson. Watson's style is close, but only close. From time to time, little anachronisms of speech slip in, and spoil the mood for the attentive reader and Holmesian. But overall the effect is a sure one, and this volume stands head and shoulders above recent Holmes offerings, like the Whitechapel Horrors, etc."
3,An old but good reference book.,"I've owned this book since 1972, then gave it to a friend. Now ordering another. Excellent fish brine! Unfortunately there is no index and a confusing ""table of contents"" but after I've brined and smoked over 1000 lbs of salmon/stugeon with rave reviews I would say it is a book worth the cost. A great seasoned salt recipe is also included."
5,Forgot to say...,"This 176-page history has a 9-page ""Roster of Guerrillas"", which the author attests is a verified and complete list of those who rode with Quantrill; in many cases, the disposition of that person is described, including city/state. Unfortunately, there is no index to this volume -- that would have made it nearly perfect. Added bonus: 32 illustrations, some published for the first time and including reproductions of drawings, photos, documents, newspaper pages, and weapons."
1,what a piece of crap!,The item is a piece of crap! It will not retract without getting all messed up and having to fold each fold by hand! I have e-mailed the seller as well as amazon and never got a response from either one! DO NOT ORDER !
3,Great game with 1 big problem,"This is a very fun game. I did not get a chance to try out the multiplayer, but the graphics, sound, and weaponry were a blast (literally). The concept of playing as a little plastic guy is loads of fun. The only problem with it: the camera perspective is 3rd person (except when using the sniper rifle in scope mode), and keeping the right point of view (above and behind the player, facing in the same direction) is impossible if in the middle of a machine gun spraying melee. The camera lags behind your turn, so you can easily end up shooting the wrong guy on some levels, because you can't see where you are firing! I would recommend a rental first to see if the camera problem is too much to deal with. At the prices of N64 games, that kind of problem is inexcusable."
2,army men games are not worthy of existence,"this game is no good, its ok for a few minutes of fun everymonth or so but other than that its.... even with gameshark codes youwill hate this.... its best use is a bookend"
5,The Battle Of The Green And Tan Continues. . . .,This game combines challenging and fun techniques from a army men kinda view. This game is excellent for anyone who has ever played with a box of little green men. I'm glad that the Army Men series has finnaly came to Nintendo. There are flaws in this game. Such as sometimes difficult to control the player. Plus sometimes the enemies don't even react when you are right in front of them.
5,"A Book About Everyday People Who Say ""Yes"" At the Right Time","The stories are not written in a dramatic style; they are about real people living their lives; stumbling along while allowing Spirit to have a small influence with magnificent results.Expecting more intense miracles, I was at first underwhelmed by the book. However, noticing that the stories lingered with me for the next week, I realized Marcia Z.Nelson is a master at reporting the facts, just the facts, leaving the rest to the reader. It works.I use this book as a mediation book in the morning. It helps me get outside of ""self"" and perhaps even allows me to become a little more willing to have God in my daily decisions. A good read, this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Fraternal regen triangle.One brother is your average decent bloke. The other brother is seen as a corporate biotech hustler, who may have come up with a process for organ regeneration. However, it is not all that well tested, and this gun jumping process may have caused a death.The two brothers end up being involved with the one wife, and also on opposite sides in a courtroom drama."
2,"Not necessarily a bargain, even in the bargain bin.","Perhaps Ben Bova heard my complaint that science fiction is filling up with the same old 600 page third person omniscient dreck that rules the mass market. Here we have a book where the omniscient folderol has been rewritten into the first person. Oh joy. But basically Brothers is all the lowlights of the ""moral dilemmas of science"" debate from Contact, an accompanying science gimmick hardly ever described in more than one sentence, and a cast of boring and neurotic characters that are unworthy of empathy. Very tedious and very mundane."
5,Very funny!,"Good cd. I bought theses as a gift but they are worth it. I also purchase several others. I certainy recommend,"
5,Best dressing ever!,"I am so excited to find this dressing once again. I used it for over 3 years while living in California. I love the story behind it, being a teacher for 9 years myself I know how important it is to assist kids in finding oppurtunities that give their efforts meaning. After moving to Kansas and now Florida I have never found it again. So glad I finally thought of checking on line. I can't wait to recieve the shippment.Sincerely, Kathy Lin Rivadeneira"
1,Can't use handsfree while charging,Was comp'ed this package by Amazon because one of the 2 T637's I bought was missing it's handsfree earpiece. Kudos to Amazon on the customer service but the plug on this hands free adapter is to big to allow either the Sony wall charger or the car one that comes with this! (The place you most likely would use the handsfree is the car... where you most likely would plug in the car charger! Duh!)Glad I didn't have to pay for it.
4,Nice,I have only taken this lure out once in the local river about dusk and used it in a small pool . After my fourth cast i caught a 3lb small mouth bass . Works goods swims well i think in a lake off a boat it would be super good
4,another good effort,"Believe it or not, ""I Am the Toughest"" was one of 3 albums 80's legend Cocoa Tea released in 1992, and like the other two, this album is full of viable reaage and dancehall tracks.Anchored by the great ""Gime Your Love,"" ""Take Mi Love,"" and ""I'm the Roughest"" (a reply to Peter Tosh's ""I'm the Toughest""?), this lp has many 12"" and dancehall classics on it, and is a fine example of Cocoa's excellence."
4,Very fun.. original game,We love this. It is educational but fun too... My girls 9 and 11 love Egypt and are very interested in the game. When we received it we had to play every day.
3,"Good premise, disappointing plot","I loved most of the songs, the style of the city and the costumes of the more outrageous characters. The setting and the main premise are wonderful, the idea is brilliant and world is a dark, industrial delight.I hated the plot, which was predictably comfortable at best, banal at worst, and the characterisation, which was painfully 2D and made it hard to enjoy and empathise with Nate, Shilo, and the Largo family, who were an otherwise interesting cast.But in the end, I've watched it over 10 times since it arrived, and will watch it some more, because despite it's flaws it's a fun -very, very bloody- musical, and there's something irresistible about Repo! that I can watch over and over."
3,Interesting,"The concept is great. Anthony Head (Giles from BUFFY) is great. Sarah Brightman is great. Some of the singing is not so great, and a couple are pretty bad including the lead female--I think Paris Hilton was added just to make her sound better. The story gets a bit draggy in places, too. It is fun to have seen it, though."
2,Be prepared to be annoyed,"I like the premise of the movie, but the incessant often mediocre singing and songs became extremely annoying after a while. I know it's not suppose to be a serious movie, but I can't comprehend the incredibly high rating it has garnered. Very cheesy."
3,An O.K. movie,"This movie wasnt exactly what i expected it to be some parts were cheezy but overall it was an alright movie. Honestly on a scale of 1-10 id give it a seven only becouse it featerd Paris Hilton,the good thing is that she didnt sing much throughout the movie becouse even with the help of computer programsshe's still terrible at it. But overall it was an alright movie the setting was cool and the story was good if i remember it correctly, i wouldve gave it a 4 star review if they would've used a different actress in part of Paris Hilton. but the movie was ok i guess."
2,chair leg pads,"These are much smaller than I thought they would be and are not useful for the situation intended. The stick-on felt pads don't work at all on chair legs so I needed an item like this with the felt factory attached. If they had a larger version of these, I'd buy it today."
4,An excellent dictionary of Scots/Lallans,"This is a very comprehensive dictionary. It's a Scotch-English dictionary, so it can't be used to convert English to Scottish, but if you're trying to work out what a certain Scotch word means it's invaluable. It has all the common words and even some basic phrases (for example it explains that ""ye're"" stands for ""you are"") but it also has some very obscure words in there (did you know that ""toog"" is Scottish for ""a small hillock""?)"
