4,It was a good read.,I very much enjoyed the first two books and when this one came out in paperback I had to have it. I reread the first two before reading this one. I enjoyed reading up until the end. I felt it went way to fast in ending the book. Overall it did give me a very good sense of what life was like for the Native Indians before the white men invaded this country. I would gladly read anything else she writes.
1,"very, very boring.","I bought this book , by mistake, I thought there would be some romance lots of suspense and an interesting cast. What a mistake, badly written, no plot . I finally gave up , it went into the garbage.I advise Christina Skye, to read the books of Catherine Coulter,Iris Johansen and my favorite Nora Roberts as J.D. Robb, if she wants to write good , intersting suspence romances."
2,ROMANCE????,"Big disappointment. There were some funny times in the book that kept you interested, but where was the ""hot"" romance? I also thought the story was kind of silly and not even close to being realistic. I have to admit, I lost interest about three fourths of the way through and didn't even finish it. This book makes a good library rental, but I wouldn't waste my money on it."
4,The Leverage King,This is one book that has opened my eyes to the concept of L-E-V-E-R-A-G-E in business and in everyday life. Once you start reading this book it is hard to put it down; because you get excited about the next paragraph which is filled with information on how to use this eye opening concept called L-E-V-E-R-A-G-E. If you are not familiar with this concepet then this is a MUST READ!!THIS BOOK IS A WINNER!!
1,A big disappointment!,"I bought this product, thinking I was buying the ""best"" product available. To my surprise, the pan leaks through the holes where the handle is attached. For the price, I think this is absolutely unacceptable.The lifetime guarantee is worthless, because I took the set out of the country (to Mexico) before using it. The purchase was an act of faith, which I have lost now."
4,One reservation that I had was that I'd ...,"One reservation that I had was that I'd come out smelling like Chinese take-out because of this product's sesame oil base. However, the scent is very light and pleasant, not at all what I expected. After using this product I found my dry skin to be much improved and softer to the touch. Overall, I'd give Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula very high marks and will certainly continue to use it."
1,Don't bother...,Doesn't provide enough stretch and is very hot to wear on your foot. Buy one of the braces with the hard-plastic spine.
1,Not worth the money,"I was hopeful this would work but there are WAY too many straps & velcro it took me an hour to figure it out , even with instructions. If I got it tight enough to hold my foot in position it made my foot / toes fall asleep. Ended up buying Futuro brand support at Walgreens."
4,Microbes,Loved these little guys. Gave them to the granddaughter who is thinking of going into medicine. Same as Red Blood Cell.
4,The Neutrogena Norwegian Body Moisturizer was very good ...,The Neutrogena Norwegian Body Moisturizer was very good overall. A small amount will go a long way and it moisturizes well. It won't leave an oily layer like some products tend to do. My only reservation with the product is the high cost.
3,B SIDE: R. Strauss...,"If we were still in the age of the LP thats' where the selectionson this disc would appear. Sure, all the music is characteristic of Richard Strauss and the orchestrations shimmer in glorious digital sound. Included are very sketchy notes that aren't very helpful at all. The end result is music that goes nowhere. You will have to research elsewhere for a better storyline. The program spans Strauss's lifetime career, begining with ""Guntram""(1894), ending with ""Capriccio""(1941) his final opera. The works on this collection are best served as filler for Strauss's tone poems, for they barely are enough to stand on their own."
1,"If there were a ""no stars"" rating, that's what I'd choose.","This cd is awful. It's the kind of recording that places play on St. Patrick's Day to go with their green beer and plastic Leprechaun hats. There are so many recordings of good Irish music in the world, from traditional tunes to pub favorites, that people have no excuse for buying this one. It sounds like 1940s movie credits."
4,"Good for listening, but not for speaking","This set offers a nice mix of conversations (on going golfing, buying a house, dining out, going shopping, taking an ocean cruise) and the method of giving the dialog at a normal pace, then slow pace, then normal pace is indeed helpful. However, I found myself wanting to be able to listen and repeat -- but there's no ""space"" between the dialog which makes this difficult to do -- unless you continuously use the pause button. C'est dommage."
2,If only I had the guide book.,"I ordered these lessons form a vendor on Marketplace, though i received it in a few days' time, the manual was not inside. I have started with the first cd and I understand much of it, but I am not sure what I am hearing at other times. I really need the guide with the french text and english translations, that should have been with the package. The seller is willing to refund mony, but cannot provide the guide. Does anyone know how i can get this guide? I looked on the products site and had no luck. Does anyone have an electronic version or some such of this guidebook? Any help would be appreciated. This is the product missing the guide:Immersionplus French Complete: The Final Step to Fluency! (Immersionplus(tm) Audio Series) (French Edition)"
3,Needs updates,"For an intermediate student of Italian or a near-beginner who has mastered grammatical structures and the most familiar verb tenses, this is a very enjoyable primer. We follow an American student's travels in Italy via dialogues, letters, and narrative. There are short lessons on Italian history, culture, and its arts. It is variously illustrated and an enjoyable read as much as a language text book.Its drawback is that its material and photographs are dated (the first editions of this book appeared in the 1960's) and misses contemporary usage and slang."
2,controler,the art on it is very good. but the thing broke within a month of playing i will never buy from this company ever again.
2,Found something MUCH better,"the price of this is very good...and you get what you pay for. we went to the store (thank goodness) to compair some of the umbrella strollers. this stroller here is as good as any of the other cheap. small, uncomfortable strollers. we test drove it through the store. it doesn't handle very well. my daughter who is 3 yrs old was extremely uncomfortable in it due to the size, and she's actually small for her age. we found another stroller, Volo Stroller - Carbon by Maclaren USA, to be MUCH better. as i said before, you get what you pay for. this one is much lighter, has a strap to carry it when it's folded and it has storage under the seat, unlike the JEEP one. We love Jeep products, but this one they have failed on. we needed something small, light weight, but comfortable, and easy to move around for our trip to Disney, this on wasn't it. it's just like any other umbrella stroller."
3,Good if you have a small baby,"Good if you have a small baby, if you are not tall, and not carrying anything with you."
2,Not all it seems,"These pots cook evenly and well I have no doubt of that and could never review otherwise. Unfortunately, stick resistant is a huge difference from non-stick. Buy a non-stick fry pan as well as this set. I was least impressed with the anodizing job. My pots are only a few months old and the outside has scratch marks showing the shiny aluminum/steal base below. Furthermore oil stains are difficult to remove from the outside of the pots. (I had to take steal wool-who wants to scrub that hard?) I must give them credit though this set has just the right sizes for what I use most, but those sizes can be found in many cookware sets."
1,I want my money back,This is trully awful. I wish I had not bought this item. What a waste of money.
3,Lynn,It was done well up to the end. I got lost with the ending! It left me with alot to think about as to what realy happedned? Maybe that was the Directors intention!
2,bettter than nothing,"I have noticed that most people are NOT happy with the solutions presented in this manual, I agree that some of the solutions may be rather short, but it is 10 times better than being left to the solutions in the back of the text. Bottom Line = It's better than nothing."
4,Cuttin' Up: Wit and Wisdom,"I've been admiring this book from afar for a long time now and finally bought it recently. My only regret is that I did not buy it sooner. When I received the book it was a one day read for me. I actually learned a lot from reading this collection of memoirs. By far, the most amazing story in this book was that of a certain Barber who was the cousin of Emmitt Till (We all know who that is). That story, by itself, is worth the price of this book. And, he even supplied a pic of him and Emmitt when they were very young to back the story up. This is one of those writes that reminds you how important The Barbershop, that we tend to take for granted, is in the community. I appreciated this book very much and would recommend this to anyone interested in getting a more in depth look at the world of barbering. So, please buy this very interesting book, If not or yourself, purchase it for someone else."
3,Shattered Union,"This is a great turn-based game in the vein of Panzer General. But its simplified mechanics make it easy learn for somebody who never played this type of game before. Also, this game has really nice 3D graphics - a rarity for this genre. The entire USA is rendered in a really nice abstract way, with great camera controls, and you don't need a powerful CPU to see it really well, but you WILL need a 128 mg video card. Word of WARNING, though. This game could cause hard system lock-ups and it has other persistent BUGS. And the developer doesn't really support the product and there will never be a patch!Honestly, I loved the game so much, I decided to replace my 4 year old computer in order to play Shattered Union. Wouldn't you know it, most of the bugs are still manifest with my new rig as well, although no more system locks, making the game playable in most modes. And remember, there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Buy at your own risk."
5,Needlecraft Fiend,"The leaflet is beautifully put together. The instructions are clear and the graphs are beautiful. The finished product is wonderful. The individual motifs can also be used in other areas of needlework. For instance, as a rug border, or as a beaded necklace. Just beautiful."
4,good sound work,"This is a good book, clearly exposed and with good maps and well chosen topics. As other on this series, it is a very small format for its content. Everything is correspondingly very small.Should be 50% bigger in both dimensions.Overall, good value for money."
4,seniors,This was worthy buy for my mother in law who likes to read and has a good sense of humor when it comes to senior moments. Would buy this book again.
2,Awful,"A silly, shallow and uniformed bio that falls far short of lending any insight nor new information on this brilliant author/illustrator. Written by a local reporter for the San Diego Union, this is one of those ""gee, and I knew him!"" efforts that does not deserve to be seriously considered.Pass on it."
1,don't buy floam!,My daughter wanted this stuff for a long time and won a container in a raffle at school. She was so excited to try it. But our container was very dry and we couldn't mix the gel in with the beads because the gel was all dried out and so the beads just got all over the place. It was horrible - now I'm glad I never bought it for her. Don't buy floam!
2,SO-SO product,"I finally broke down and purchased this product for my son. It was a huge disappointment. It was so sticky we couldn't even touch it without getting it all over us. Not to mention that we had to SCRUB to get it all off. I felt so ripped off I went to the ""floam"" website and complained. I was very surprised to get a reply and apology. I was told that I purchased part of a bad batch and was asked if I would like a refund or a replacement. I asked for a replacement. The new tub is fun to play with and not very sticky at all, occasionally I have to get a few bits of slime off. I, however, do not think it's good value. I think I will try the recipe I found on-line. I think that would be more cost effective not to mention educational. I do commend the company on their good customer service."
1,Do not waste your money,Do not waste your money. My son was so excited to get floam. He had been asking for it for a very long time. Finally I gave in and bought it. It is like little pellets in green slime. It is so wet and slimy that it is not possible to mold it into anything. And you can't stick it to anything like they show in the commercials because once you touch it it is hard to get the slimy mess of off your hands. It is very messy and impossible to play with. The commercials are very misleading.
2,Fun for a short while,"The floam and beads easily separate, which required us to ""mix"" it together everytime the kids used it.While in a matter of weeks it was turning black with mold. Most disgusting!No matter how much pleading will NEVER buy again. I gave it a two because the kids really did enjoy it."
1,no good,This stuff is a waste of money. It is too sticky to do anything with. I threw it all away and the kids didn't even care. Lousy product!
1,Nightmare Product,"If 0 stars were an option, that's what I would have given this awful product. Doesn't work anything like they show on TV. So sticky, messy, and slimy, and the smell is just awful. I didn't even want my kids to touch it because of the terrible chemical smell. I find it hard to believe they can label this product ""non-toxic"". Total false advertising. Do not buy this mess."
3,I liked the fact that it wasn't scented. ...,"I liked the fact that it wasn't scented. With all the smelly soap, shampoo, and perfume I have, all together it's too much. The soap was not quite moisturizing enough for my skin though. It still felt dry, especially in Ohio in the winter. I usually use a lotion after showering, but the product said it """"conditions"""" the skin and I just thought it would give my skin more moisture. My skin felt squeaky clean. It didn't irritate like some harsh soaps can. I would recommend it to someone who wanted an unscented, gentle soap -- and didn't need much moisturizing."
2,Disappointed,"Based on the book's description, reviews and price I expected much more. For some reason the pictures for each episode are printed in a fuzzy, cloudy way. I'm sure it is intentional, but don't understand the logic -- clear pictures would be more enjoyable. The comments on each episode are rather bland and unenlightening. Nothing new here at all!!!One noted error -- Mrs Trumble's last appearance was not in the Bon Voyage episode to Europe. She did appear in the 6th season - Little Ricky Plays the Drums."
3,Unofficial theme song,"The song you are looking for is Eric Benet's, Love Don't Love Me. I'm not a Benet fan, but that IS a funky cut! Enjoy..."
3,"The Song is ""Big Bad Mama""","For the reviewer that was curious about the song ""Shante"" (Vivica A. Fox) was listening to in the car, it's called ""Big Bad Mama"" by Foxy Brown and Dru Hill."
4,very engaging story!!,"I liked this book. Sunday's character was well developed and I couldn't wait to find out what she was doing next. The one star review baffles me. It may not be the reviewer's cup of tea but it's not that bad. In fact, I couldn't put it down. felt kind of rushed toward the end, but overall very engaging. Thumbs up especially for the kindle price."
3,Entertaining story,"I found the story interesting, especially the historical information presented. What troubled me was the end when Charlie was harbored by Sunday. He was the enemy of the U.S., and even if he was a nice guy, he still was a German who would have torpedoed our country if ordered to do so. I found that troubling. The writing style is simple and straightforward; it's a quick read."
4,CA State Tax Problems,"There are some problems with the CA State Tax. The California State Tax software does not go to completion. I own a beige G3 MT Mac, OS 8.6 with a Radeon For Mac graphics card. After three weeks, I was unsucessful in trying to get the software to work, even after several ""updates"". I promptly got my money back.The Federal version works fine but this deluxe version does not seem to point out where there are potential problems nor does it recommend tax cuts as it once did in the previous versions. If they make a basic version for the Mac, I would preferably purchase the least expensive version because there are no tax advantages in purchasing the Deluxe."
4,Windows issues,"If you had a Mac with OSX, you could simply print as a PDF (built in to OSX). Then you can file/print it anywhere you want to."
3,"No [C-Dilla] on Mac version, but...","...Intuit charges $10 more for the Mac product. I guess you are paying for the premium of not having to worry about activation codes, limits on printing, and numbers of returns you may process. Don't let the grousing PC users scare you off from a pretty good product -- its always nice finding those little perks for the Mac user that stick it to the WinTel hegemony.I have always liked these Intuit products, especially if your tax returns aren't terribly complicated or exceptionally simple.The product seems to be up to the usual level of quality, but if they do institute the security system on Turbo for Mac next year, I will probaly switch to other software.I give three stars, since I fear for Intuit's future decisions about how to secure its software."
1,Same problem as the PC version?,"According to the reviews for the TurboTax 2002 PC version, the product can only be printed from one computer. If you change computer in the future, you won't be able to file an amended return. You won't be able to print your tax return if IRS audit you. Intuit also installs ... C-dilla on the PC. If the same [also] applies to the Mac version, I don't recommend using this product."
1,ah man......,"OK, I love first person shooters. This one looked good. Looked even better when I installed it. Looked like Crap 60 seconds into the first level because it crashed my computer. Every time I tried playing it, it would crash. Sigh, oh well. Uninstalled it, taped up the box and got my money back."
4,my kid loves it,my daughter loves to play on easy mode so she can win every time. I play it on normal difficulty mode and enjoy the challenge of the game. i recomend it for relaxation..
4,Nursery sewing book for beginners,Great little spiral bound book for a beginning sewer. The pictures help a lot and the directions are easy to follow. One caution on the crib sheets is to measure the mattress that you are fitting as there was a change in size a few years ago. My first mattress sheet came up a little short. I advise using streth material anyway to get around the problem if there is one. A terrific book for beginners and others too!
4,B&W rocks,Some Keyboards don't work with it But if You Find the right Keyboard it Will work Otherwise it is great
5,"Nice product, quick shipping",The product arrived faster than I thought. The quality was 1st rate and I was very please and would recommend both the product and the company...
1,Not worth a penny!,"I bought this straight razor a few weeks ago to enter the world of straight-razor shaving. I have to admit that I read some reviews of similar products but I thought that people were just being extra-picky. Much to my chagrin, I found out the hard way that this razor cannot cut air, let alone hair! I honed it with my japanese stone and stropped it before use, and it totally butchered my face. I am back to my trusty safety razor for now until I can afford a ""real"" straight razor like a Germany-made Dovo. The final word: don't buy it."
4,What you mother didn't tell you about cooking kosher,"A book for those who think that kosher cookery is based only on the recipes handed down by your Mom. Containing a wonderful collection of simple-to-prepare, mouthwatering, international gourmet recipes which strictly adhere to dietary laws. A beautiful gift, but buy it for yourself!"
3,Forgettable but important,"I love the idea of having a sequential art (or whatever you want to call comics) anthology by all-women. And I love that the introduction is written by one of the greatest feminists of my generation, Kathleen Hanna. however, besides the fact that all the stories were written by women, there was a strong common thread lacking through all the pieces (as is usually the case in most sequential art anthologies). There were some gems, and it is definitely a book that a female comic afficianado will want to have on her shelf, but it it's not hard to put it down and forget about it."
1,defective/mismarked items---three times!!,"i ordered three of these items. all three are mis-marked. they are missing FOUR INCHES on the back so you can't wear it. simply defective. BEWARE!! (if three came like this, they are all mismarked i think_"
4,Unveils culinary questions to a new minutia... Great!!!,"This book encompasses three of my great passions: History, Science & Food/Cooking. With a very scientific voice explaining the interactions of cooking at a molecular level, the author easily draws you in to any topic from pickeling to fermentation. You can open this book to any page and learn about the foods you enjoy and where they come from -- both historically and chemically. I love this book!!!!"
3,Not for a lay person,This book is a little hard to follow if you don't have a Phd in biblical studies or ancient history of the middle east. I will admit that it isn't an easy read.
3,Love JJ but don't like the selections,"This ""ultimate"" collection does not include many of the songs which demonstrate his mature music from the later 1970s. While ""Tryin' to hold the wind up with a sail"" is in the collection, where is ""Contrary to Ordinary"" and ""Too Old To Change""? This collection seems to favor his rowdy music without enough of his more serious works."
4,"""Gypsy Songman meets Mr. Bojangles...Lone Wolf""","Hip-O Records has released all original recordings spanning some four decades, the result is Jerry Jeff Walker and his amazing Texas Connection through song.Composer of such songs as ~ ""GYPSY SONGMAN"", ""SANGRIA WINE"" AND ""MR. BOJANGLES, a classic among classics composed and recorded by Walker...the high side of this CD is, Hip-O has taken their selections from two of the best albums ~ ""Viva Terlingua"" and ""Ridin' High""...another great album is ""Great Gonzos"", many of Walker's recordings are still available...but here's a tip, pick this one up, it's the life and times of the ""Gypsy Songman"" ~ JERRY JEFF WALKER!You might try other Hip-O releases, all worthy of a good listen ~ ""Bluegrass Essentials"" (HIPD-40102)...""Bluegrass Essentials Vol. 2"" (314-564-682-2)...""Delbert McClinton Ultimate Collection"" (HIPD-40170)...please check out my reviews on amazon.com/music.Total Time: 77:38 on 20 Tracks ~ Hip-O Records 088-112-563-2 ~ (2001)"
5,Very Happy,This work very well. I had some scares on my legs and I wear shorts a lot and this helped them go away in time this past summer. I'm happy with the results.
4,Mederma does Work...,"I am using Mederma for scars on my legs. The Mederma does work great as the scars are barely there any more. However, it has taken about one year of using Mederma to get these results. So while I am certainly pleased with the outcome, the downside is the expense of it. Using it twice a day for one year to get the desired results has been terribly expensive."
4,BE CAREFUL NOT TO PLACE ON SKIN AROUND SCAR,"Ive been using this product for about 2 weeks now and yes the scar is lightening up day by day, but I am also dark in complexion and the skin around my scar is also lightening. When applying the gel just be careful to not get it on the non scarred skin."
3,idk,"came right away jus started using,hope it starts working soon i wanna wakeup and the scar is completely gone might try a new method idk..........."
2,Not sure about this one.,"I bought this because it was highly recommended for acne scars, which I have, on a few different web pages I searched. I had to stop using this after three days because like the other reviewer my face turned reddish and discolered on the areas I used this gel. I'm trying to take attention away from problem areas on my face not to it. I also bought the new and improved fresh scent formula. I'm not sure what's considered a fresh scent in Germany(where it's made) but this stuff stinks. I'm going to try it on the stretch marks on my arms where I don't mind it being red but never on my face again."
1,DONT GET IT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN,I have a scar on my nose from picking a pimple and I wanted to get rid of it. So I got Mederma for $20. I used it for a week and I didn't really see a difference. But on week two it made my face worse.....I put it on other scars on my face from chicken pox and I broke out!!! I have very sensitive skin....Im going to start high school soon and I'm really nervous so this made me more nervous. I have to go to freshman orientation looking like a ugly pimple face with red marks on my face...nice...don't get it.
4,Works especially well on new scars,"I fell and scraped my knee a few weeks ago and it wasn't healing well, so my doctor recommended this product. After 5 days of use, I already notice a difference. I will say that I am probably going to go through the tube in about 3 weeks, so the price is pretty high, but I guess it's worth it since I won't have a scar."
3,Fades them a bit,"Ok for new scars, but it's not a miracle worker. It does seem to lighten a new scar but doesn't take them away like the ads say. Just fades them a bit which a lot of people only need. Didn't work for me with older scars."
2,mederma itches,I had seen all the commercials and decided to give it a try on a scar on my stomach. The product made my skin so itchy that almost every time I had to clean off the gel because the itch was unbearable but I have seen that the scar is lighting.
2,Not Recommended,I've used Mederma with sunblock and it's much better. The gel does not soak in and dries slowly. It sits on top of your skin and dries with a high shine--not good on your face. One more thing: the label says to apply 3-4 times a day. Fat chance!
3,Mederma Scar cream,"Have not used the product yet, however have used other products from this manufacturer before and was very pleased with the results"
2,A Rootin' Tootin' Good Time,"This swaggering Oklahoman packs a whalloping braggadocio into his super-sized frame. This stage of Keith's long, hard record label ride finds him experimenting with 'hick-hop' ""I Wanna Talk About Me"" and ballads alike, to varying degrees of success. Stretching his horizons hoping to make the prarie-sized grade, Keith sometimes errantly dwells on topics appealing to the trailor park listeners of yesteryear, and that ain't gonna git it. Time will tell if this cowpoke can hold on for a full 8 seconds. Meantime, enjoy the ride partner."
2,"Fond of Tennant, Love the Doctor, but not this movie","I admittedly picked this up to watch purely because I loved David Tennant as the tenth doctor. I'm not normally a romantic comedy fan, which perhaps makes me biased, but he was a zany, funny actor on DW, so I thought I'd give it a shot since it was free to stream on prime. It was a way to pass two hours, but not a particularly great one.Tennant is much more quiet and restrained in this film, still a little snarky, but not as funny as he was as the Doctor. McDonald was alright, but her performance wasn't memorable. The narrative as a whole was flat and unbelievable, and the characters of passing interest at the most.If you want more of Tennant's more lively humor or more of the angst he portrayed as Ten, go re-watch an episode from series two, three, or four. Don't try this movie simply because you're a DW fan."
4,Delightful and Evocative!,"I really didn't know what to expect when watching this film, except that I knew David Tennant starred in it. I was pleasantly surprised - my friend recommended I watch it, and I'm glad I did! However, this isn't a typical American-style romantic comedy. Some serious topics are covered, and I did find myself feeling quite sad at some parts! But do try it out, you never know until you try. :)"
3,"A rom com so don't expect great things, but it does have David Tennant","I wouldn't have watched this (on Amazon Prime) but for the fact it starred David Tenant. It was entertaining enough, but if you're not a David Tennant fan I wouldn't bother."
2,Dopey and predictable,"I loved David Tennant in Dr. Who and he does a fine job in this boring movie with what he has to work with. But, not a single unpredictable moment in the whole thing."
1,Decoy bride,This movie was not worth the money to purchase it. Didn't even want to finish watching it. What do you say about a movie you did not like. I am 68 years old. Love movies. but not this one.
3,Just okay,Not great not horrible. Had some good stuff and some annoying stuff. Would just say it's average. Not more to say.
5,Loved it:),"I am also a David Tennant fan from the US, and was so excited to see The Decoy Bride available here on Amazon. It was a really cute movie that was a bit quirky at times, laugh at loud funny (at least I did), and enjoyable to watch. David was (as usual) fantastic and Kelly MacDonald was lovely to watch as well. The island was a gorgeous backdrop for the story too. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys chick flickish movies, and/or is a David Tennant fan:)"
1,last resort movie,Movie was a bit boring. Liked both characters in Harry Potter- Other then that ..not really that good.I wouldn't recommend. Its sort of a less then intresting love story.
1,Silly Chick Flick,This is a tedious slow boring movie of Scottish people trying to be funny....They are not. I made it 45 minutes before finally turning it off in disgust. I think the Director's family wrote the rest of these reviews as the seem to have no concept of character development or an interesting story...
4,Hugh's story--suspense and romance!,"I waited to read Hugh's story because I liked him so much in the previous book (Silken Threads) when he showed up at his sister's house.This is more of an adventure story than a romance. While there is romance and love (definitely love and hot sex!), the characters are on a crusade to find out who is conspiring to overthrow the king. This means masquerading as husband and wife as they spy on their countrymen.The strength and courage of the characters is astounding (particularly of the strong female Phillipa). Anyone who loves strong female characters who don't cower in danger and wait for men to rescue them, will love this book.Definitely worth reading!"
3,Good reference book,"The best thing about this book is the extensive list of reference literature; almost 800 of them. Other good parts are examples of standards for writing requirements specifications, and how to pin down and analyse difficult problems. On the down side, it sometimes goes into too great detail. It could be written a bit more pedagogic."
4,You get what you put into this software.,"I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my ""house"" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first."
5,Wonderful transaction!,"I was more than pleased with this purchase. I had a previous experience with a different seller and the same book where the book was not in the proper condition and I received it late. I also had trouble contacting that seller. However, this book was in a padded envelope and sent in excellent condition. I was VERY pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again. Thank you!Moments: The Pulitzer Prize-Winning Photographs: A Visual Chronicle of Our Time, Revised and Updated"
3,"Good book, but a bit out of date.","This book describes the physics of the formation and minimization of soap films and bubbles. It relies heavily on mathematics. For example, the interference patterns in a soap film are given. Rigorous proofs for the minimization of bubbles and soap films are helpful, but only if one has had enough math to understand the proof. The author also uses conventions that many people would find confusing. It would not be hard to split this book in two. The first book would be just the observed phenomena, and the second would be the mathematical proofs of the phenomena. This book is well written, but the interposition of the mathematical proofs changes this book from a cool book about bubbles to a textbook about bubbles"
3,Procede with Caution,"I have not read the text book. I am a former student of Dr. Buss' and suspect that it will be as vacant in theory as his previous literary attempts. Evolutionary Psychology is an extremely interesting field, but as with any field must be considered in an interdisciplanary manner. The reviewers that make blanket statements about Evolutionary Psychology being the only world view might benefit from reading some philosophy without prejudging it as merely a coping mechanism. For those of you who considering purchasing this book, the last time I spoke with Dr. Buss, he had only very superficial knowledge of the more detailed and sophisticated theories in this field of study and this will probably be reflected in the text book. To be fair, his writing is often enjoyable and as others have said, does read like a novel, but do not mistake this for depth of knowledge."

3,It's ok.,I like this cover because you can attach various toys to it and use it for tummy time or for proping up a sitting baby but the cover is way too big and does not fit properly over a boppy pillow. I am hoping this cover will shrink in the wash and fit more snuggly.
3,"Good toys, cruddy cover.","The cover is a cheap material and it doesn't even fit the boppy properly. It's way too big, like it was made for a different item. My baby loves the toys that came with it. The linking rings are OK but very tight. It's good that they're secure but kind of a pain to get them on the loops of the cover. We still use the toys but haven't bothered with the cover or linking rings since about a week after receiving it."
2,"Excellent iron, when it's working","I've been pressing my own clothes for over twenty years, since my early days in the military, and Advancer is easily the best iron that I've ever used. The combination of heft and exceptional steam generation make quick work of common ironing tasks. As many reviewers point out, it dramatically reduces the time that one spends ironing.Unfortunately, the Advancer is not as reliable as one would hope or expect. Like a large number of other reviewers, I've experienced failed electronic temperature controls on two separate irons, neither of which had the decency to fail within the product's warranty period."
1,Rowenta Advancer DZ 9080 $130 down the drain!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this iron and thought it would last me several years. After only a few uses the light would not come on any more, than it seemed to take forever to heat up, now after only a few months it doesn't heat up at all.So much for German Craftmanship. I should have returned it to the store for a refund when the light failed to work.After reading the review from the person from Hawaii I decided it wasn't worth the aggravation to even try to send it back for repairs.I donated it to my trash can."
5,Rowenta is THE Best!!,"I LOVE my Rowenta. The company has AMAZING customer service, too and I highly recommend them to anyone. In this day and age when it's tough to find a company that stands behind their products, I am overjoyed by the service and attention from Rowenta!I had taken my Rowenta to a recommended appliance center to replace a simple switch. ""Chadwicks and Hacks"" had my unit for a whole month and RUINED my iron -cracking the casing, staining it with grease and grim and the staff was extremely rude.I called Rowenta to complain about my experience with this appliance center and Rowenta offered to replace my unit because of the hassles caused by the service centre.Rowenta has a customer for life now and I will recommend them to any and every one!!"
1,leaky poorly constructed iron,Do not purchase this iron. Just because you're paying more doesn't mean you're getting a better product. First the dial fell off; we were able to snap it back on but it's clearly not solidly attached. More distressingly the iron has sprung a leak. Just overall a terrible terrible product. Do your research and find something else to buy. Choose a reputable third party consumer research provider and reap the benefits. Don't take my word for it.
1,Short-lived product,"I have owned two high-end Rowenta irons, the second being this model. The first iron lasted 1 1/2 years, then overheated and melted my clothing before dying. The second stopped heating after 1 year 2 months. I have never dropped or misused the irons. The problem is internal, so the iron must be sent to a Rowenta service center for repair, which can be costly and take a month or more. Investigate before you invest in this iron; my problem is very common."
2,Good but only lasted 18 months.,"The iron worked very well for the first year or so - no problems. Then the temperature indicating light (red-yellow-green) quit functioning. Not what I would have expected for a $100 plus iron, but it's only a light. Now after about 18 months total, the thing doesn't work at all (barely gets warm). Could have bought two or three cheap Black & Decker for the price paid for this iron. So much for getting the quality you pay for..."
3,$100+ IRON with reliability issues,"I used the iron for approximately a year and a half. After which it refused to switch on. Like all the other reviews, I am assuming my iron burned out. Now if this was a cheaper iron and had I not paid $175 for it, I would have been annoyed instead of being upset.The iron when it worked was wonderful.Save your money buy a T-fal ultraglide. They are a lot cheaper and offer similar if not better performance.T-Fal FV4259 Ultraglide Easycord Nonstick Iron, BlueT-Fal Ultraglide Easycord Iron with Comfort Handle - FV4269003"
2,Not worth the money,"I received my iron about a year ago. I have a room for my quilting and sewing projects so I leave my ironing board up with my iron on it. The iron puts out alot of steam and gets creases out well. I also like the tip for getting into small places. My problem with it is that the it leaks. My ironing board ends up soaked under the iron between sewing and pressing quilt pieces. I called Rowenta service. I had to mail the iron from Portland to Seattle, no local service center. They had it about two months. Luckily, I still had my ten + year old Black and Decker. It held water for about two weeks and started leaking again. When I initially called Rowenta, I expressed my dissatisfaction that $100 iron wouldn't last a year. They basically said that's how it happens sometimes.I wouldn't reccomend getting this iron."
1,Another Rowenta Iron bites the dust,"Shocking isn't it that such an expensive iron would consistently fail in the same way? I think Rowenta knows that a high price and a ""made in Germany"" sticker will help it sell more units then its terrible reputation will scare away potential new customers... so they go their merry way selling 3rd rate irons. Admittedly, I fell for the high price status symbol too, because in the real world you believe you get what you pay for. My rowenta up and died just before the warranty expired, and I shipped it to the service center after getting a return authorization. So after 3 weeks... nothing. I called them and they claimed they never got the iron! Ha that's what tracking numbers are for. So they finally ""gave in"" and said they will ship me a replacement, in a mere 4 weeks! What? I raised holy hell and got it down to 2 weeks.I expect when this replacement arrives it will last about the typical 6 months, then I'm through with Rowenta. Times are tough...buy American."
1,Warranty Stinks !,"Purchased this high priced iron based upon a recommendation that Rowenta irons are the best. Hogwash, this unit broke within the manufacturers 1 year warranty and Rowenta is hard to deal with at best. Turns out the thermostat breaks on this unit quite frequently per Rowenta and you must return on your dime to a service center for repair. No estimated time of replacement, and because of the need for an iron in most families another unit is now needed. Wont be another Rowenta, and I highly suggest looking at a well optioned Shark or Procter unit that costs considerably less and rated better. Irons should be designed to last more than one year, especially in normal household setting. Very disappointed !"
1,Wonderful Product Won't last,I have owned 3 Rowenta Irons - as I look back now all the controls failed after a year of very light use. Below was my initial review 14 months later I had to replace the temp control. This failure made me a little angry because this iron is both expensive and such a nice iron. By now they have to know of the failures on the temp controls. I am quite handy and did the repair myself - the part cost about 35.00 - others have had problems getting the product repaired.I have owned many high end irond dating back to the expensive Panasonics of the 1970's. Also 2 prior Rowenta's. This is perfect. It does everything well. It is even a vertical steamer. Beautifully made. Owners of pre 1970 homes with older electrical circuits should be careful - this is a 1800 watt appliance. The are other fine quality irons that only use about 1200 watts. This iron responds to any user demand due to its high power elements. Great product. Highly recommended. This is a real Gem!
3,Expect a little more!,"Am always a fan of Rowenta Irons, have to replace them every now and then because they don't last very long.Recently upgraded to a DZ9080. Must say that the water for the steam don't last, probably after ironing 1 1/2 shirt I have to refill the water -----it gets a little tiresome after ironing a couple of shirts. The iron is a littleheavier than the regular ones. Apart from that, I have not recieved the mail in rebate of this iron after I sent itin a couple of weeks ago and there is no help for this on the Rowenta website. I am not sure whether I will buy this model again when this one goes, hopefully not in the distant future."
2,Great Iron that lasts only 18 months,"I'm on my second Rowenta Advancer. Love the iron but unfortunately, it burns itself out after 18 months. BOTH irons have had this exact same issue. It does a beautiful job, just plan on replacing it every couple years."
1,Waste of money,"I ignored many reviews about this iron, and purchased it 2 years ago. When it worked, it worked great, I never left water in it, cleaned it after every use, and it just stopped working, 3 times. I sent it back to the company, since it was only 2 months old and they sent me a new one. After 5 months, that one also stopped working. I brought it back to the store and they replaced it once again, and after 4 more months, the new one stopped working. I wanted this iron to work out, because it was good when it worked, but 3 irons in less than a year and a half?"
1,Lotion,I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea. It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture.
1,This is not what I had expected :(,"I had originally planned to use this as a replacement of my former Yes to Cucumber Night Cream because I had hopes of finding something less oily. When I first started using this product it was decent and worked well for my highly sensitive skin. However, when I started using this in place of my using Olay day moisturizer it backfired. Before, I had velvety smooth skin that only received an occasional blemish from menstrual acne. Now my texture is grainy under the chin, and bumpy along the right jaw line; and my skin looks red and irratated. I am not saying this is a bad product, I am just saying don't replace your daytime moisturizer just yet."
5,absorb very nicely,Works really nicely. It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice. I definitely recommend this product.
1,If I could only give a negative review....,"This stuff is horrible! Not only did it make my skin breakout, but they were all those gigantic, blind pimples. The painful ones with no head, so that they take forever to go away and are impossible to cover.Product ingredients, which I just finally got to check out now (they aren't listed on the bottle, just on the box that comes with the bottle) include dimethicone. This is the stuff known for being non-water soluble, which causes it to just sit on the skin and build up instead of ever washing off. The only way to keep it from totally clogging your pores is with very harsh cleansing, which if you bought this product for the ""sensitive skin"" label, you're not going to be able to handle.Maybe if you have skin that's less prone to breakouts and allergies, this could be a product for you. For me though, it wasn't such a nice experience."
5,A wonderful treasure of excellent singing and choral direction,Beautifully sung music --- I had another album with the Bulgarian Women's choir which was good but this one is better. The choir's and solists' intonation is fantastic. It is a treat to hear tones outside the Western tempered scale sung with such precision and warmth. I also enjoy the tempi and phrasing of these works. The choral director should be applauded for his fine shaping of these rhythmically complex works.The sad thing is the manufacturer discontinued this - hopefully Archiv will consider reissuing this and Vol2.
1,Bad Grammar,"I am continually amazed by how many children's books contain incorrect grammar. At this age, children are rapidly developing language skills, and they do so by repeating what they hear. In this book, the authors write: ""Thomas goes slow. Slow slow slow he goes"". Do writers not understand the difference between adverbs and adjectives? Or do these publishers hire incompetent writers for children? Why would anyone want to teach their children to speak English incorrectly? If you want high quality Thomas literature, I would recommend the books that are closer to the original versions by the Awdrys, rather than bastardized, badly written books ""based on"" the original."
5,Promptly received,"I was hesitant to try this product but since it was priced significantly lower than in the stores, I thought I would try it for the price. It appears to be just fine."
3,"good product, but not for everyone","This product caused clogged pores on my normal, blemish-free skin, so it's not for everyone. It's still useable for my hands so I don't consider it a waste, especially at this great price. Also, it wasn't offered on super-saver shipping - and I found it at my grocery store."
1,huh?,this crap sucks. i can totally understand why ive never heard of this band. it got recommended to me because i bought the new rehab album. so i picked it up used for 1 cent. now i want my fucxin penny back! nothing like a bunch of suburban white kids trying to act ghetto. you can act trailer but dont act ghetto. i can not relate to this shxt at all. horrible rappers. horrible band. im usually not a hater but amazon tricked me into this crap so im voicing my opinion. if you have a couple cents to spare pick it up and find out for yourself.
1,Poor Test Prep Book,"This book was shallow, poorly written. Do youself a favor and read a textbook, buy another prep book, but don't waste you time on this. I feel like a got stiffed for $30"
3,It smells weird and I'd rather use soap. ...,It smells weird and I'd rather use soap. Why spend all that money when soap will do its job? It did come in a pretty package but I'd not recommend it.
2,"While I rarely use a toner normally, I ...","While I rarely use a toner normally, I used this product consistently for several days. I really liked the fact that it was alcohol free, so I didn't expect it to be drying at all. Unfortunately I found it to be drying, and I had to use much more moisturizer than before. I'd recommend this product to friends or family who need oil control but it's not suitable for those whose skin tends to be dry."
4,very good stockpot,"I read a lot of reviews before I finally purchased this product. I didn't have anything bigger than a 6-qt pot so I had to borrow a friend's Calphalon hard anodized stockpot to cook for a party. I was extremely satisfied with it so I decided to get one for myself. I got it during the kitchen sale and it was promptly delivered.It is a very good stockpot. The handles are wide, positioned well, and don't get too hot. It is easy to hand wash except that if you have a shallow kitchen sink it might be too hard to move around. Wash it in the utility sink instead.I gave it 4 stars because I have a problem with the flat lid. Whenever I lift the lid the condensation on the underside of the lid runs off in all directions. I don't get this problem with domed lids. With domed lids, the condensation runs down the middle when you tilt the lid open. No spills, so steam burns. I will probably use a different lid for this pot."
5,"My ""Go to"" pot","I've been less than satisfied with other pots when I've tried to save money and buy aluminum, etc. This one cost a bit more, but still a good deal. And I may never need to buy another one. SO worth it."
3,Calphlon Stockpot,"This product is a sign of the times. I have had Calphlon cookware for 15 years before commercial high end cookware like this was not really popular for use in homes. I really love my ""orginial"" cookware which was manufactured in the USA. This piece like all new Calphlon is made in China. I have this same stockpot which I purchased years ago and it weighs twice as much as the new one. The wall thickness is much thinner than the orginial. Cooking in Commercial Aluminum is about heat distribution and the thicker walls is important. If I were buying all new cookware I would not be looking at this product to outfit my kitchen. Im sure that China could duplicate the quality but the company chose profits over quality in this case."
3,"Very solid, but kind of inconvenient","Quality: 5 stars. Very well built, solid, good heat conductor.Value: 1 star. You can get a better stock pot for less money.Convenience: 2 stars. It's semi nonstick but not really, and it's not dishwasher-safe."
3,Made in China ? Come on!!,"I bought this specifically because it was a USA quality product. While it may be still a good pot, the dang thing was made in China. I was sorely disappointed. Never again."
4,recommend,"I use all Calphalon products, be careful because cooking with Calphalon is different than using the more inexpensive pots and pans, ie; you will have to adjust your heat settings while cooking different foods but very easy to get used to. Calphalon also stands by there products 100%. Had a problem with an old non-stick pan and the co. took at right back and replaced it with no hassles."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"the characters differences of opinion are expressed in non-sequitor emotional outbursts rather than thought-out points. sex is only talked about as an abstract concept so they're not really saying anything about it. oh yeah and i almost forgot the reason i rented it in the first place, i thought it would be funny, and it really isn't. ""backdoor. frontdoor. sidedoor."" is the only bit that made me laugh."
1,Not enough variety of good music,"I have many Chinese music CD's, this one is in my bottom three. I am not sure what ..""Very Best.."" songs they consider these to be. The CD seems to have too many of the same type of songs--lacking variety of flute, drums and other types of music. I heard better selections from CD's in the public library."
2,Mini version,"Beware - this book is only 3.5"" by 6"" in size. The content is exactly what I was looking for but there was nothing in the ad to warn me that it was so small."
5,great book!,"My wife wanted a copy of Christmas Carol, she loves this! nine more words nine more words nine more words"
5,Winning at Parenting without Beating your Kids,"I discovered this Audio Tape when my son was 4. I credit it with providing me with the parenting and communication skills to help him become the confident, independent, communicative and resourseful 16 year old he is today. I would recommend this tape and the book ""Kids are Worth It"" by the same author to every parent."
5,Perfect Example of Goldenthal's Genius,"Goldenthals range and creativity is perfectly demonstrated on this outstanding CD. The recording quality is demonstration class and the music is thrilling, intense, operatic, original, and moving. The cd switches style between Mahlerian/Wagnerian operas to swing and jazz with such ease demonstrating the versatility of the composer. A warning though, the music is modern, and vulgar (appropriate for the storyline) and Goldenthal employs very modern orchestration techniques."
1,jeff,I was very disappointed ! The movie did not play at all. Need it replaced. Please e mail me information on replacing it.
2,Only the cars shine in this movie!!,I saw this movie today and I thought what a thin plot. A guy just trying to get home to see his wife deliver. Kinda thin but hey I watched it anyway. The acting was so so but the best acting was by the radio guy Jason Priestly if that says anything. The car chases are really the only thing that keeps you interested in this movie if you're a Mopar fan. Still for the price they want for this movie I could find 5 other car chase movies that are all better. I'm glad I was one of the ones paying this outrageous price or I might have committed suicide.
3,Caution,"This book contains much of the same information as that included in Napier's earlier title, Recreating Your Self. What makes this book different from the other is its Buddhist, rather than psychological, bent. Depending on your knowledge of Buddhist principles, this book may be of use; it seems most suited for those with only a sketchy background in the Buddhist tradition. For someone well-versed in that tradition, this book may well be a disappointment, for it does justice to neither the spiritual tradition it espouses nor the psychological underpinnings of its content. If you are interested in a more forthright treatment of meditative practices that encourage healing, get the earlier title."
3,Too dense and theoretical for beginners,"The exposition is correct and concise, but too dense for someone without an extensive mathematical background.I would much rather recommend Shreve's Stochastic Calculus for Finance II. Though longer, it is much more well-motivated and gives you a more intuitive feel for the concepts as opposed to Oksendal's full-on theoreical treatment."
2,Unjustified,"Oksendal develops stochastic integration, but only integration with respect to a Brownian Motion integrator, not with respect to local martingale integrators (e.g. The Ito process). This presents a problem because in his Finance section (and question 4.3) he wishes to integrate with respect to an Ito process, which is not neccessarily a Brownian Motion. Based on the theory he has developed in the book, this is not justified!!"
4,A must for any intermediate music student.,Any intermediate guitar student who is studying guitar will find this book filled with exercises and scales (no songs) that you will need if you want to understand music. It will also give you finger techniques so you can play easily. Not for beginning students.
5,not for beginners but a powerful book,"This book is best used with a qualified teacher, a new student will be confused. Not a self-help book, but it contains very powerful techniques that when applied will make you a powerful player."
4,BERNSTEIN'S BENCHMARK UNFINISHED,"Leonard Bernstein's 1963 New York Philharmonic recording of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony No 8 (as was his version of Schubert's No 5) has long remained a performance by which others are judged. It is simply superb, with a lofty nobility that sets it above virtually all rivals.Although marred by a final movement which is at too fast a tempo, the 9th Symphony performance is fine as well. What a pity that Bernstein never recorded an integral set of the Schubert Symphonies. This wonderful CD, though, is partial compensation; the Unfinished is truly magnificent.David Lloyd, Bedford, England."
1,Sound quality not so hot.,Alternates between inaudible mumbling and deafening blast of a horn. I found my self continually turning the volume up and down.
4,love this toner,"I had been looking for quite a while for a toner without alcohol and finally found this Nivea at a reasonable price. It really does cool and soothe my face after cleansing. It is also easy on my extremely sensitive eyes. I do have a beef with the screw-on lid: if the bottle spills with the top on, it'll leak big-time. The lid doesn't keep the liquid in at all. But, overall, I like it better than anything else I've tried (and I've tried them all!) Will purchase it again."
5,Better than expensive brands!,"My aunt (who is a retired nurse) has beautiful skin and told my mother and I that she uses this toner. We tried it and now we're hooked.I have dry skin and I used to buy a product that cost about $30, but the Nivea Visage does a better job for a lower price. For the past 2 years, this product has been a ""must have"" part of my daily beauty routine. Everyone compliments me on my skin. Some may be genetic, but I really think that the right products help. I no longer ""need"" to wear foundation and concealer, just a light dusting of powder.It's difficult for me to find this product in drug stores, or the ""marts"" in my area. When I find it, I stock up. Some stores stock it, but always run out; other stores stock Nivea, but not the Nivea Visage line.Now the the product is on Amazon (for a slighly higher price than in most stores), I can buy it whenever I need it without running all over town looking for it."
4,Epi for Public Health Practice,"The book is very well written. Clean examples are given. The authors do a great job of avoiding complex and confusing examples. The book made epidemiology more interesting and much easier to understand than it could have been. Charts, graphs, and tables help clear up differences between similar concepts and provide examples of concepts."
5,my son's second favorite toy!,"The quality of the product is very good. The rubber at the bottom, the quality of the plastic and the weight of each stone could prevent accidents. My 3 year old son, who is now undergoing therapy could benefit a lot from this toy. I was disappointed though when I saw there were only 6 stones.Highly recommended!"
2,Too elementary for adults,"I'm disappointed to discover that this game is too junior for myself and my friends. The question cards and experiments are way too easy. This game would only be interesting to somebody in the third grade or younger.I was really hoping that somebody had invented a truly creative game involving science, but this is basically something like chutes and ladders with some very elementary mechanics questions thrown in.On the plus side, the game is very nicely made with cute drawings and good artwork. I wish they would make an adult version that is truly creative and challenging."
1,DOES NOT WORK IN PS3 SLIM WITH LATEST UPDATE,"I watched the movie in 3-D in the theater, and enjoyed it. Bought the Blu-ray for use in my PS3, but does not play b/c apparently software is updated enough."
5,Excellent,My husband had requested this for Christmas and he is enjoying listening to this CD. Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 4 / Capriccio Italien is a favorite.
5,great addition to your potrack,"if you are buying or have a potrack, this is an excellent addition. holds things in both directions, doubling the capacity. great quality, too."
1,Beware--doesn't work until TV Guide problem fixed,"I'm very disappointed with this product. Toshiba has said that the Symbio only works with new Toshiba TV's that are HD ready--thus encouraging the purchase of these TV's. BUT . . .the Symbio can only record future programs if the Toshiba TV is able to download TV Guide listings---and they can't!!!Toshiba customer service acknowledges the problem and claims that the issue has been identified to ""the head office"". Not good enough for those who have spent thousands on the Symbio and the HD-ready tv. Toshiba will need to fix this asap or face a massive recall obligation.Beware!"
4,Decent,"At first I was hesitant, I was thinking should I get this one or should I get the men one. The price was the mind changing factor in my opinion, and it did fulfill the needs I was expecting. Nice face skin :)"
3,Oil-Free?,"Not sure how oil-free this product actually is. Albeit water-.base, the texture is medium-heavy. I highly recommend it for the neck, where it's quite safe, but am skeptical about the face."
3,got frozen,"It is unfair for me to rate this product because it may have become frozen while it waited in a package on my doorstep in Minnesota for a few days before I opened it. It is now rather runny, possibly as a result. I'll try it again later."
3,still oily,I was very eager to buy this face moisturizer when I saw that it's oil free but got disappointed because it still brings oil to my face in less than an hour after applying it! So I really don't know now which brand to trust whenever they claim such things on their products nevertheless I'm still using it since I found a way to at least diminish the oiliness on my face after applying it.
3,Brownpaper cover please!,"Does anyone else remember those anonymous brown paper covers that people used to hide their steamy romance novels in? This is not THAT steamy, and the cover is not embarrasing, but the plotline always leaves me feeling embarassed for anyone to know that I've read and enjoyed it. If you like romances with happy endings (duh! It's a Silhouette, they've never had anything BUT a happy ending) and a few rocky places where misunderstandings occur, you might enjoy this."
2,Poorly researched & cheesily written,Just another mediocre popular history. The research is exceedingly weak and the author's lack of real knowledge jumps off nearly every page. On top of this the book is so pro-Stilwell one wonders if old Joe's estate paid Webster to write this on his behalf. We're still waiting for a competent history of the CBI theater...
5,LOSTTRACKS,I REALLY ENJOY ALL OF WILLIE CLAYTON'S MUSIC SO WHEN I HEARD THIS ALBUM IT WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE WILLIE'S VOICE IS SO SOOTHING EVERY SONG HE SINGS TAKES ME BACK TO THE FIRST TIME I FELL IN LOVE AND THE WORDS HE SINGS JUST SEEMS TO COME FROM THE HEART HE IS TRULY A GREAT SOUL SINGER
4,Willie Clayton is ALL Good!,"This is another Willie Clayton CD that I wanted to add to my collection. It is good although some of the songs are on other CD's. I am really trying to obtain all of his CD's. I would say that 98% of his CD's are good to very, very, very good. I love to see him in live performance but he has not been to Nashville, TN. or near hear that I know of for a while. When he records more CD's, I will buy more of his CD's!"
3,Works-finally,"I included this in the build of a new system running Windows 7 64bit. Windows did not auto detect it and I spent many hours getting it running. I agree, tech support from this company is poor.It runs fine now but I would not buy this again."
2,A disappointing purchase of an excellent movie,"The film came in good time but it was an obviously pirated copy which had been made to look like a rental unit. The vendor likely purchased it in a lot and likely also didn't know that the copy was pirated. The cover of the case was well done but obviously faked. A search for the video rental store brought no result and it likely never existed. It played fine with a couple of dropouts due to it being a copy.I love this movie. I first saw it on the big screen in 1979 and was impressed by the storyline. The sex scene was a big deal at the time but tame by some of today's standards.It was released on a limited basis on VHS but never saw a release on any other media. Thus, original copies command prices in the $120 range. Finding a copy at less than $30 was a find that became a disappointment once the fact that it was a copy was ascertained."
3,It's ok(but not made for toss & turn person),"I started using this product at my 4th month because I was having lots of trouble with my back pain & laying on my side. After using it for a week or two the part that's under your belly got flat. It really didn't work that great once that part is flat! Also if you toss & turn a lot like me the velcro strip will probably come undone or the pillow might fold & the velcro touch your skin, ouch!!! Now I'm in my 5th month & I'm getting more used to sleeping on my side, I still use this because it does give me some help with my back but if it isn't positioned just right it falls off my bed. I have tried folding it and putting the wedge behind my back & that helps but of corse it does fall off the bed."
4,"Helpful, but not a miracle","The Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge has given me an hour or two of extra sleep when I feel the need to use it. I didn't really think it was going to work very well, but it provides a nice support system for your back and belly while sleeping on your side. The only problem I have with it is not being able to reposition myself easily or get out of bed easily when I am using it. So I usually end up throwing it onto the floor midway through the night so I can move around better.Even so, I would recommend this product because it has helped me get into a very comfortable position to fall asleep in... and I am getting up to go to the bathroom several times a night anyway, so it's not like removing the wedge is causing a sleep disturbance."
5,got to have this one,this cd is must have excelent songs and it also has the video and the making of. you have to buyyyyyyyyyy it.
2,Shop fan,"Compact and useful. Moves a lot of air for its size. After appx 3 days of use, motor is already noisy. Probably will have short life span."
4,I did not bother with the movie.,"I had numerous kin, friends and co-workers tell me to read Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants. I told each person that as soon as I obtain the opportunity I would read the novel. The narrator, Jacob, did an eminent job guiding the reader. Personally I didn't feel everything he was going through, but I was able to help justify his actions. For instance when he finally yelled at August or when he consummated his love for Marlena. What intrigued me most about Gruen's writing was her ability to tie the ninety year old Jacob to the circus Jacob. I was thrilled how she gave Jacob a sense of eudemonia when the book concluded. Jacob finished up where he began; he ended up right where he wanted to be. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this book a 9. All in all when you read it you won't be disappointed."
4,Fantastic holiday read,"This is not really a particularly intellectual book, or the kind that will have you pondering but it will hold your interest and enthrall you; which makes it a perfect holiday read. It is not only a fantastic love story but is a seemingly accurate depiction of circus life during Great Depression (so you still get to learn things after all)and has enough plot to hold your interest but not so much as to seem over engineered. There is even a lesson about how we should treat old people.A good read"
4,Fantastic,"This story takes you to a different place and time, I never wanted to put it down. Definitely one of my top ten reads."
3,it's okay,"The main characters are rather dull, and I empathised more with the animals and the side characters than the protagonists. The circus life was the most interesting read though. worth reading once."
2,"Easy read, simplistic and predictable","I enjoyed the ride in this less than a days read, but will not recommend it to any of my friends or family. Very predictable in the plot, the elephant revenge, the pregnancy and everything else. Boo"
4,Water for Elephants,"I love the story and I think it is a very well written novel. This is the first time I have ever read a book electronically and I'm a little disappointed that the layout of some pages does not follow the layout of a printed book. E.g. in some instances two different characters are having a conversation, and these are both printed on the same line. It can make it confusing as to which character is speaking. In normal printing conventions, each character's conversation would begin on a new line.Also, in places there are symbols where words should be. I'm not sure if this is common to electronic books or merely an oversight in this novel."
3,Reminds me of the story the notebook,"This reminds me of the movie the notebook because the story starts out with an old man in a retirement home and he retells his story from his old days. I give it three stars because I thought the ending was cheesy. I have yet to see the film. However, the characters are likable and the book is very vivid."
4,Surprisingly entertaining,I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus. But overall this was an entertaining and well written book. There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly). But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story. Surprising twist. Sweet ending.
4,WATER FOR ELEPHANTS,THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND VERY WELL RESEARCH. I ENJOYED THEINFORMATION ON THE CIRCUS AND THE YEARS OF THE DEPRESSION. SOME OF THENURSING HOME WAS A BIT UNSETTLING. THE MEANEST TO THE ELEPHANT WAS ALSOSOMEWHAT UPSETTING. OVER ALL I WOULD SAY IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE FAST READ.
5,water for elephants,What a wonderful story....well-written with sympathetic characters. It really evokes the mood of the pre-depression era bringing emotional responses to the surface in the best possible way.
1,I knew it,"My book club read and discussed this book a few years ago. All but one of us hated it. I knew then that it was written---or edited---for easy adaptation to film.Ta da!!The overall skeleton of the story is not bad, I just wish that another writer fleshed it out. This is minor literary fiction, at best."
2,Depressing truth about getting older...,"I could't wait to read this book - all the hype of the movie and reviews really peaked my interest. I'm probably in a very small minority that doesn't see what the big deal is or maybe it was because I wasn't in the mood to read a book of this nature. I found it to be depressing and end in a fizzle.It was very well written and I can see how it will make a good movie but there just seemed to be an element missing. Getting older and not a ""spring chicken"" anymore is depressing and to think of how quickly life is passing me by each hour of everyday is as glum as you can get. This book screamed it at me and although the ending was a good one for Jacob it just left me wanting for something else and with a depressed heart."
3,Raunchy and Explicit,"I am amazed that none of the reviews I read mentioned the highly off color parts of this book. Call me a prude, but I felt that these sequences spoiled an otherwise well written and enjoyable book. It would be helpful to know in advance that a book has explicit scenes in it. So, I am mentioning it so other readers will be aware."
3,Not Without Its Charm,"I have never been a fan of the circus, but I do enjoy historical fiction, so I gave this one a try. I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction. An earlier reveiwer summarized the book as ""melodramatic"" and I completely agree. It is like popcorn; light, fluffly, easy to digest and quickly forgotten. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend -- if there is nothiing on TV."
4,Started off slow but it won't disappoint you.,"Like I said, at the beginning I hung in there. A really good book will have me page turning till the late hours of the night that wasn't the case at first. As I approached midway through the book I was up late reading and I began taking the book to work to sneak it a few chapters. The author did a great job of researching the matter you can tell from the vivid writing and dialogue. Great read."
3,Good read,"Easy fun read. A lot of dialogue. You can read the book in a day. I wish the book was more descriptive, but it was worth reading once."
2,The book reads like a movie,"Personally, I did not find the characters compelling and the plot seemed made for a movie. Not what I am looking for in a book."
3,Just okay,"This book had its moments, I cried and I smiled. However there was a lot in between those moments that I ended up just glossing over. I find that the book is normally better than the movie so I'm glad I read the book instead of watching the movie. I don't think I could have sat for the whole movie."
5,Water for Elephants,"Water For Elephants kept my interest through the entire book. There were so many details about the circus, I was surprised to find out the author has never been to one! Very well written."
2,nasty parts of book,"There were small parts (pages) of the book that were in very bad taste. It's like a PG movie and an X rated. Leave out the X rated parts and it will not hurt the book, plus everyone would be able to read it and feel like it was a good book. If the bad parts of the book had been out, I would have given it a 5 star, because it is a good book, it is just some parts when read make reading the book not a good experience."
4,Great book,The book kept me interested and moved along very well. The beginning was OK but the end was the best part. I have not seen the movie.
2,Waste of my time,"I kept waiting for the story to start and it never did. It was a simple story that could have been told in one page. I kept thinking I was missing something but it was obvious that I did not. It is merely a simple love story that ends exactly the way you think it is going to end. No surprises, nothing to keep you turning the pages. I do not recommend reading it. Go online and read the Wikipedia plot in 60 seconds and there you have the entire book leaving nothing else to know."
2,"a fun read, but a very shallow story","I enjoyed reading this book, but I was disappointed in its serious lack of character development. I read on the cover that the main character Jacob was supposed to develop a relationship with the elephant Rosie, but I never really got a sense of that. Jacob never really developed, and aside from the fact that his love interest Marlena resembled his old girlfriend, I never really felt the chemistry between them either. All in all, it's a fun book to read, but don't expect any emotional attachment to any of the characters. The relationships, as well as the characters themselves, are all poorly developed."
3,"Good story detail, tho sordid enough to take away from the story","I was rather disappointed with the way some of the sordid details took away from an otherwise interesting story line. I really liked the ""backstage"" peeks into the real life of what being on the road (or on the rails) could be like. And the general story line was very interesting. Not totally my cup of tea, but perchance my high expectations going in didn't help. Keep your expectations a bit lower & it may even be more enjoyable for you!!!"
4,Excellent service and exactly as described,The book was in great shape and arrived before I knew it! Thanks for great service. The item was exactly as described.
4,It's a good read.,"The story line kept my interest but at times I considered not finishing it because it disturbed me. As it progressed I begun to dislike the main character. Then I read the interview with the author at the end of the book and found that it was her intention to portray our ""hero"" with all the flaws. I guess my ideal is a comic book hero."
5,Great book!,"I saw the movie first and then knew I had to read the book. As expected the book is even better than the movie, amazing detail and unexpected plot twists. Great read!"
5,Review of the book Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen,"This book was one that I couldn't put down. It was lively, exciting and very well written. The subject matter dealt with the circus--a part of life that remains a curious fascination to most of the world."
3,cruelty to animals was hard to read,"I am not sure what I see all the hype about for this book but it was a pageturner, I'll give it that. The writing was very well done as Jacob told his tale of being in the circus all these years later in a nursing home, forgotten and old in body, not in mind.The life of the circus was clearly visible while reading this story as was the life in a nursing home. At first I was more interested to have the chapters go back to the present because the past was so horrible to witness but then his present life wasn't that cozy either.The ending was the best part of the book, for me, as it was most tender. It wasn't a bad read but not an entertaining one."
4,Good read,This book is unexpected and has a great ending. I would recommend to anyone. Very surprising and refreshing. Very good read.
3,"Entertaining read, but lacks depth","I picked this book for my book club because of all the rave reviews. While it was certainly entertaining, and the story kept me going, I did not find the writing to be particularly good and thought the story lacked deeper meaning for a book club discussion."
5,Water for Elephants,I love this book! I found it hard to put down at times. I would recommend this book!
1,Water foe elephants review,"This book began well, however, the language used and the graphic sexual descriptions were very unnecessary and due to the severity of both, I quit reading the book after the first several chapters."
2,Was not impressed!,"I didn't see the movie and after reading the book, I wonder how it became a movie.I though it was a ver slow read, just didn't capture my interest enough....Not much if a storyline."
1,water for elephants not for me,I dislike strange sexual behavior but most of all I hate killing and mistreatment of animals and other humans. I just didn't look into the book far enough to realize these things were written about.
1,Gorey descriptions of animals being slaughtered,"I did NOT expect this graphic brutality when I bought this book; circus animals killed because of lack of food or just laziness on the part of the handlers. The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover."
3,"Interesting Subject, Mediocre Writing","I'd heard some raves about this book and decided to treat myself. What I found was a reasonably interesting story that was not terribly well told: for such a graphic topic, the prose was not very visual and often skimmed surfaces of moments that could have been captured with much more attention to detail.I would not recommend this book. If someone is looking for a phenomenal story involving wild animals, I would suggest ""Life of Pi."""
5,Who Would Not Like This?,"This book was part of my wife's book club. The club loved it. So, I finally picked it up and started reading it. As a quick note subject matter for a book does not matter to me. I care about good stories with great characters and this book has it from cover-to-cover.Logically, I can't think why I would want to read a story set in the 1930s about the circus, but there I was reading it night after night. It's a fascinating story with superb description that is slippery-easy to read.I don't know what your hesitation is...read this book. There are tens of thousands of worse ones out there."
1,"IN MY OPINION, COMPLETE GARBAGE","I wouldn't even give this book one star. The language was filthy and the sexual content absolutely a waste of the $5 I spent on it. I did not finish the book. I don't care how true to real circus life, or how much research went into writing this book to ""make it real"", there wasn't any need for all of the crude vulgarity and obscenities that were portrayed and written about in detail. If you want something uplifting, inspiring, and worthy of your precious time, please look elsewhere."
3,Not For The Sophisticated Reader,"While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere."
3,Better Books Are Out There!,"I listened to the unabridged audio CD version as I drove the last couple of weeks. I know that the book was (and is) a wildly popular bestseller, but I have to confess that the thought that kept nagging at me as I listened was why? I'm not saying this is a bad book. It is somewhat engaging. However, I didn't find any of the characters particularly vivid or humanly multi-dimensional. And as soon as Rosie the elephant was added to the circus, halfway through the book, I had a (correct) feeling as to where the plot line was moving, so no surprise ending. I have no idea whether circus life in the prohibition era was anything like this, so can't comment on the authenticity of the backdrop, but I found it pretty depressing. Altogether, a pretty so-so read."
2,No love in this love story,I didn't feel any of the connection between the characters in this story. It seemed like an escape from their present situation more than true love.
4,First time read n buy,I liked the book!First book I read in years and enjoyable to read!First book I bought for kindle!Good start to reading all over again!
5,Satisfying Read,"Ups, downs, humor and tragedy, this novel was beyond enjoyable. An excellent view of the past and present, realistically showing the perspectives of nursing home patients and circus folk alike. Would recommend."
3,Good,I liked the book by all means and it is a good quick read. I guess it didn't grab me like it did others though. The circus theme was a bonus and very different.
5,Water for Elephants,Was an excellent read would not have chosen on my own but book club picked it & I enjoyed it .Would recommend it as a read to anyone.
5,water for elephants,I loved the book. A well written story about circus life during the great depression. Can't wait to see the movie.
4,Great Read,"I was hesitant to read this book because I'm not particularly interested in the circus, however; it was a revealing inside look at how hard 'carnie' life was. It also shows how life can throw you some curve balls that completely changes the path you take. This story flowed and it was hard to put down...nice and easy to follow."
3,OK,"I liked the way this book was written however it is not a happy, feel good book by any means. The abuse of the animals in it bothered me. I guess I expected it to be an uplifting book, which it is not."
5,This one was a suprise,"This book suprised me. I did not expect much, but it has won awards. So I tried reading it. What a pleasant suprise!! The writter draws you into the story in the first chapter. Circus and the Depression are not a topics I am usually interested. This book was great. The writter captured life in a nursing home. A old man and what his life was like prior to the nursing home. Amazing story and well told."
4,Excellent read,"This book was thoroughly enjoyable. It was a bit edgy in parts and certainly gut wrenching in others- not unlike Grapes of Wrath in feel, but although well written it is not in the calibre of Steinbeck. On that note though one isn't always im a Steinbeck type of mood. If you like pathos, uncertainty about how things will pan out and history without the whitewash- this is a book you will like. If you like a well written, crafted novel as well, you will love this."
2,fun story ruined with pointless side topics,"I had heard good things about this book. I was ready for a good light read and was intrigued with the beginning, but surprised by the constant obsession with sex. The author could not continue the story line without throwing in a useless and pointless portion about sex. To me that really took away from the story and ruined it for me. By the end of the book I was disappointed and didn't like the end at all. If you want a light engaging story, I'd skip this book. If you're looking for something other than a Harlequin Romance Novel, but with that type of subject then feel free to read this. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,"Vivid Circus Story, Otherwise ehh, just okay fluff (Spoilers)",The circus part of this novel is great and beautifully written and I really enjoyed it. Two things bothered me however; he really didn't do anything veterinariany after the initial diagnosing of the horse and the romance between Jacob and Marlena wasn't well evolved.overall it was good bathtub reading and it made me more interested in the circus.
5,Amazing,This is a must read. It captivates you from the very beginning and keeps your interest all the way through.
1,Save Your Time and Money,"This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history. The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing. Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight. I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film. Now that will be a real flop! If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able. This was just a terrible book."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Reading the first line of this book caught me immediately. I have ADD with books sometimes, but this one, I didn't slip a word. The author makes you care about everyone, even the jerks."
3,Engaging but not intoxicating,"I found the book entertaining, albeit a little depressing when reading about the narrator dying. However, I never fully connected with the characters in that I was wasn't sad to leave them when the book ended."
5,Touching and Romantic...a Great Book!,"I honestly just picked this book up b/c i kept seeing it places and figured i would try it. It was a really great book and i have recommended it to almost everyone. Not only is the storyline entertaining, touching, and romantic (without being too girly and sappy)...but the author does an amazing job of building the characters. I was disappointed when the book was done because i wanted to keep reading."
5,One of my new favorite books,"Along with the Miracle Life of Edgar Mint, The Secret Life of Bee's, and Kite Runner; this is one of my favorite books. I read it, gave it to my husband (who rarely reads a book)- he finished it in a week, and my 15 year old daughter - who finished it in a day. We all really enjoyed it! The way the author describes life in an old-folks home is hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time. Even though it started with the end, we all found the book kept us wondering what would happen next! Especially good for a book club!"
1,blahhh,I really don't understand why this book has such great ratings. I found it dull and repetitive. Definitely not going to read another Sara Gruen novel.
2,Not well written,"I am a little more than half way through this book and I am tempted to stop. The writing is just so mediocre, making it difficult to enjoy the story. Like ""The Kite Runner,"" a very good story that is told by a writer with average storytelling skills. I am compelled to finish books that display a quality of writing that engages me with their style and composition at the sentence and chapter level. This one just isn't doing that. But I want to know what happens...I want to know the story but I don't want to have to read the shapeless sentences the author has created to tell the story."
3,The good and the bad,"I really wanted to like this book, I really enjoyed learning some of the slang and history of the circus. I like the circus and I was told I'd fall in love with the animals and the characters of this book. The fact is I hated the raunchy descriptions surely we could do without those. I felt the book to be dark, twisted and weird. I did indeed love the animals but didn't like the characters. Honestly - I only read half the book because of these things. Too bad."
2,Not what I thought it would be....,I have to admit I never finished the book. I tried a few times but couldn't do it. My main problem was all the horrible things they do to the animals. I have quite the soft spot for them and the things they do are horrible. I just couldn't get past it. I don't think I could ever go to a circus...knowing how things are run. Maybe the movie will be more of a love story...thats what they make it seem. To me to book was just long and drawn out!
4,Water for Elephants,"As a ""person of age"" I found myself able to relate to the main character, Jacobs thoughts and comments. I found the story about circus life in the depression era very entertaining and believable. Marlena, August, and Uncle Al were colorful characters as was Rosie, the elephant. Times were hard for these people and the class differences were very apparent. Jacobs circumstances were so out of his control that I really could imagine how he must have felt. I liked the way the story went from present to past easily putting myself in Jacobs position of not understanding how the body didn't quite work as it once did. It was hard to believe that the author did not have a personnal connection to the story through a relative or acquaintance."
2,not for me,UGH! The first couple chapters were wonderful. Then it went downhill so fast I thought I was reading another book. don't waste your money.
4,Water for Elephants,"Very good book. Beware, however, of animal cruelty throughout. A little difficult if you are sensitive to that."
5,Wonderful delightful,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very easy to read, extremely descriptive, and left me wanting more. I could not put this book down from start to finish I just kept wondering what was going to happen next. I loved that the story was told through Jacob as an old man. The author brings a warmness and understanding to how we should treat our older family members. The story brought a smile to my face and sometimes made me giggle with the details. I have already given this book to 2 friends that loved it as well. Really a great read!"
3,"Great book, shame about the poor Kindle rendition","Absolutely loved the story! The insight into circus life during the depression was fascinating, and the writing style was very easy to read.I didn't like this kindle version though- numbers were frequently misrepresented and there were many spelling mistakes (for example confusion between of/off), and the text on the final page of the novel was followed immediately (as in, the exact same line of text) with the author's notes, and then they were duplicated again. This was really disappointing and really diminished the enjoyment of reading on the kindle. You wouldn't buy a paperback with such elementary errors in publishing!"
3,"the very definition of ""meh""","After the sudden death of his parents, veterinary student Jacob joins the circus, where he falls in love with the elephant Rosie and her rider Marlena. Both of his loves, though, are horrifically abused by August, the animal trainer. The setting of a circus during the Great Depression, and Gruen's obvious affection and knowledge of the period and setting, create an engaging book, but the plot and main characters leave much to be desired in terms of originality or interest. Though gritty and unflinching, particularly in its look at animal cruelty, the book's potential is wasted, sadly. Turns out to be pretty meh. Grade: C+"
2,creepy,"Just when you stop grimacing from one unbelievable gorey tragedy and don't think it can get much worse, it does. Violence, murders, foul language, adultery, gore, and animal cruelty dominate. It was creepy. I listened to to audiobook, actually. It was the sections narrated by the 90 or 93 year old that kept me even listening, as they were interesting musings of growing old, and the more senior actor narrating them was great!"
5,Excellent entertaining read,"I loved how this story switched between the past and the present. I haven't read a book like that in awhile, so I was really happy for something different...a little break from the norm. I couldn't put this book down, and now heard it is being made into a movie. Woo hoo!"
5,Cannot wait to see this on the big screen!,"Wonderful fast paced read. Not once was I bored with this story! I laughed, cried, and was angrered in some parts, but this is what the best books do. This will start filming May 22nd starring Robert Pattinson, Reese Witherspoon, and Christoph Waltz (Inglorius Basterds). Read this book!"
5,Water for Elephants,... Would this novel be good for my granddaughter who is ten and half going on 30?Wayne
2,Failed to captivate,"Water for Elephants was a pleasant read; however, it fails to live up to the rave reviews. Although the amount of research the author did was impressive and the narration intriguing, the book lacks depth and the character development is quite poor. The love story does not have any real substance and is almost unjustified as the incessant desire Jacob and Marlena have for one other happens almost immediately, even though their contact is extremely minimal. The ending is also a bit off to say the least, but I will not spoil it here. If you're looking for a quick read then this is for you, but it is truly over rated."
2,"So, so...a light weight read","I don't know why this book is on the best seller lists. While the story is interesting, the writing is too one-dimensional. The character development is elementary at best. In my view, this book seems to have been written by a child. It is so simple; it lacks depth. What's up with the reading public?"
3,A Fun Read,"I greatly enjoyed reading this. It is not going to start any deep conversations, but it was very well researched and keeps the reader engaged. Some events were rather predictable though. In a sense, this book has two endings. The first becomes clear a little bit before the reader reaches it. The second, and ""final"" ending, is a nice surprise..."
5,Terrific,"I had heard alot about this book before reading it and read so many positve comments and reviews but tried to go into it with an open mind so I could decide for myself! I was not disappointed, it was a terrific book, so well written, full of rich history. It was difficult to put down!"
4,Very enjoyable despite my concerns about animal cruelty,"I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to finish this book, once purchasing, because of the comments from reviewers about animal cruelty. I am very, very sensitive to that topic, so I was leery, and I imagine others out there may be as well. However, my desire to read the best seller, and my husband's assurances (after listening to it), that he thought I would be ok, convinced me to listen to it. For those of you that might have this same problem, I think you should go ahead. I really enjoyed this story and it's worth listening to. Yes, I could have done without some of the scenes, but it all turns out in the end, and the author doesn't get too terribly descriptive or excessive - so that you just can't listen to another second. Also, these scenes are limited, and they are kind of an integral part to the story. I listened to the audio version and the narrators are excellent as well. Very enjoyable story!"
1,Learning to read the one star reviews!,"What this book did is make me go back and look at the one-star reviews for it. I found I am in agreement with most of them and might have spared myself some disappointment if I'd perused them prior to purchase! Admittedly, I'm a lit snob, but this came via recommendation. Next time, I'll do my research."
2,Never Really Took Off,"Based on all the 5-star reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was! I found this book to be boring. The writing was dumbed down. And I just kept waiting for the 'hook' that was going to make this the great book everyone raved about. Even up to the last chapter I was waiting for it to be a ""wow"" book and it just never was. Don't waste your time."
4,Water for elephants,Awesome book!I saw the movie as well...the book was way better! Would like to read more books from this author!
4,i would have liked it to be longer,This book is a captivating potrayal of circus life during the depression years. I believe that the author missed an opportunity; this book could have been longer and still held our attention if she had told more about the llife of the protagonist between youth and old age. Perhaps there is a sequel that could be written. The characters in the book are a fascinating mix and the author successfully describes the mix of good and bad characteristics that exist in all of us.
5,Great story,"Love love love the book. What an amazing story. Loved the characters and the story line. Could not put the book down, every time I read it I felt like I was in the book. Now that I read the book I will be watching the movie. Strongly recommend thus book for others to read."
1,Dreadful,"Dreadful. Judging from the first paragraph, this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read. I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended. If only I had had something better than this time waster: lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions, little firsthand knowledge of the circus, low-level vocabulary. A waste of time on a good topic."
2,Water for Elephants,"While it kept my attention for the most part, I was over all disappointed.While heavy on circus life, dismal on veterinary facts. Portrays a man whom is thinking with his penis and not his brain, a insult to men in general.For a title of ""Water for Elephants"" don't expect him to be sympathetic to them.He is more concerned about his love life, then the cruelty to the animals under his care."
4,Interesting,This book was very interesting. Now I can't wait to watch the movie. Hopefully it's as detailed as the book.
2,Interesting? Maybe? Maybe not.,"If you like adventure, romance, suspense, and excitement... read the last third of Water for Elephants. The first two-thirds set the stage for a thrilling ending, but that's all. Although Gruen's style of writing is rich with varied vocabulary and description, the elements of the first part of the plot evoke little to no emotion in the reader. Even if the author didn't spend a hundred pages building the back-story, the strange sexual elements that rear their ugly faces every few pages completely ruin the enjoyment of reading this book. If you want to spend 300 pages wondering why you're reading this story, then pick up Water for Elephants and enjoy the most boring story you have ever read."
3,Interesting,"I didn't think that I would be drawn into a book about a circus, but it is an amazing book that I was hooked to from the start!"
2,"Good read, but.......","This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent ""thing to do"". And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether."
2,"Not Impresses, I hope the movie is better","I wanted to read this book to see what all of the hubbub was all about. I found the characters to be characterless, and all of the research that the author did on circuses during the depression era was not written with much detail. All in all I feel that if this is what is considered as a top ten best seller, what does that have to say about the public that is reading this book. All in all I found this book to be elementary. I hope that the movie that is being produced is much better than the book."
3,Water for Elephants,"Book-Water for Elephants A very different book. Not bad reading, but far from exceptional. Would rate it a three and one half stars."
2,Not bad,Wasn't very interesting in the begining. Didn't keep me interested for very long. Didn't finish the book bc I got bored.
1,Not a good book,"The motivations for character's actions are never explored. They simply do stuff, and are never developed as more than instruments to further the plot.The harshness and moment-to-moment existence forced on so many by the great depression is well captured. Despite that, I wish I had not read this. Stupid book club. (Love you guys.)"
1,Water for Elephants,"Generally, there shouldn't be much to review about a book on CD. The story is good. The 3rd CD in this book however was warped beyond being able to listen to it. Sort of leaves one hanging!"
4,30's Era Circus Novel,"Although I wasn't sure I'd really care to read a book about the circus, I was pleasantly surprised to get a bit of circus ""history."" Although it is a first novel by this author, the writing is captivating. It goes back and forth in time, from the viewpoint of an elderly man (in an assisted living facility), and tells a story of his life on the road with the circus in post-Depression years. Quite nice ending to the book also."
4,Beautifully written,"This is a beautifully constructed book. The circus atmosphere is rich and detailed, and it's redolent of its time period. The images are strong and the pace, while not fast, is stately -- perhaps the way an elephant moves??I deducted a star for two reasons. First, it seemed that some leaps in the story came too quickly. Jacob should have spent a bit more time with Rosie before he made the statement ""I was close to falling in love with her;"" that happened a bit too fast to be believable. Also, the ENDING was awful: contrived and saccharine. That was a huge disappointment, after the rest of the book.Overall, though, a literary and very good read, two things that don't always go together."
2,Water for Elephants,I think this book was very good it just like the movie. It is amazing how this book gives details about how life was for workers in the circus.
5,Perfect for every age,"My best friend suggested this book to me because she loved it. I read it and loved it and suggested it to my mom who also loved it, she then went on to suggest to her best friend and her mom, my grandmother. As a college student and daughter to a woman in her late 50s, I can safely say this book is for any age, everyone will find it an interesting incite into circuses."
2,Fodder For Oprah-phants,"2000 readers can't be wrong can they? Umm, yea they might be.How is it that a mediocre book can consistently get raves?I was excited by the ""prospect"" of this book but the more I read, the more resigned I became to the fact that there was nothing very extraordinary about it.Not only is the writing flat and the plot a giant cliche - there's also the matter of the central ""love"" triangle being blatantly lifted from Sophie's Choice (I cringe referring to that classic alongside this book) right down to the suprise party / angry accusation by a lunatic.Mediocrity is being rewarded with a big Hollywood movie starring Reese Witherspoon. Ahh, American pop culture."
5,"....a truly, can't put it down book!!!","As much as I enjoy reading, I am not one of those who feel that I mustshare my books with others...except in rare cases. I loaned my copy to friends and family, and then decided to buy the book as gifts. The first one went to a grand nephew who is starting college and pursuing his dream.Unlike the young man in the story who could not follow his heart, my grand nephew is able to continue his love of art.There is so much in this novel that captures the imagination and touches reality and includes a love of animals that came together to keep me reading until I finished...one wonderful weekend. One of those, can't put it down books!! It made me remember why I love to read!"
4,Water for Elephants,Chosen after reading an excerpt. Good character descriptions. and scenes are beautifully depicted. I felt involved in the story. Bit of a surprise ending that leaves you wanting to stay with the main character a bit longer to see where he ends up.
2,If You Enjoy Animal Cruelty . . .,"The best part of this novel is the portion in the present day when the main character is an elderly man. His flashbacks tell a story of an impetuous and hard-to-sympathize-with attraction to a married woman and his painful experiences working for a circus under a couple of bad guys, including a sadist who abuses animals and people alike. Throw in a fantasy-like description of an elephant's intelligence and abilities, and you can decide if it's your type of story.I read some of the good reviews to try to figure out what the draw is from this book, and I still don't get it. It was a chore to read, and the only reason I finished it is because it is so popular I assumed I would finally appreciate something about it."
5,great historical fiction,I loved this book. There was fantastic character development as well as a great story. All that to go with a well thought out portrait of circus life on a train during the depression and prohibition.I cannot wait to read Sara Gruen's next novel.
4,Excellent! - Highly Recommended,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved how Sara switched between an elderly Jacob and the young Jacob. I was never bored and found it very interesting. To the reviewer who said ""X"", RIDICULOUS! It's a NOVEL. I found nothing offensive - in fact, some situations were authentically told from the male perspective (by a female writer!). A good summer read for me!"
1,I couldn't finish this book,"It is very rare that I don't finish a book. I just couldn't find a single reason to continue reading; the writing style is that of a children's book - in a strange combination with graphic sex and 21st century profanity (both of which I don't mind in the right setting), the language doesn't match the 30ies, the cruelty to animals made me cringe, and the story was predictable."
4,Excellent!,It's a very imaginative story that you don't want to end. My only complaint would be that the bad language is a bit much.
3,"Depressing. Very, very depressing","If it doesn't depress you reading about getting old and senile and cruelty to animals, this is the book for you! Yes, it is very, very well written which is why I couldn't stop reading it, but it is very, very depressing."
4,Well executed and entertaining story,"I first heard about Water for Elephants as a project that began during NaNoWrimo a few years back when I was trying NaNoWrimo for the first time. It was inspiring to hear.Yet it took me years to get around to reading this book despite many recommendations.I LOVED it!The author did a lovely job of handling so many characters big and small. She kept solid control over their little quirks, tics, etc.I particularly enjoyed seeing everything first-person present through Jacob's eyes, but I do think he was more of a woman's man than a man's man. Not that I need him to be a boar or a brute, but he was a touch more on the emotional swing side than I generally like in male characters in stories of this ilk.Didn't really matter though, because the whole package of this tale enchanted me.Wholeheartedly recommend (but be prepared to be disappointed with the movie if you read the book first)."
5,lovely,I finished this book in amazing time. I couldn't put it down. The story was written so well. I loved the old Jacob re living his younger Jacob life. All the characters were so well described. I felt as if I was right there in the story the whole time. I felt all the emotions and the story was so interesting. You can certainly tell the author did her research. It sounds like the research did was quite exciting as well. I really enjoyed the book.
4,Good but not great,I just finished reading Water for Elephants today and was quite pleased. It's a good book but is a little too short for my taste. The plot was good but I felt as if the relationship between the 2 characters could be better. Otherwise the book was good with a lot of plot twists at the end and controversial topics.
5,Water for Elephants,"This was such a good book. I highly recommend it. The historical information is informative, the characters are great, and the author is right-on when showing life in a nursing home."
5,love!,loved it all the way through. It was a joy to read and never slowed down or made me want to skip a page or two. If you love the whole carny/circus gig check out Geek Love. Classic.
3,I can't handle the truth (get it),"Yes, this story reads like a script and I was interested in the characters.....however I thought the terrible things that happen was just too much. Reading about the terrible things that happen to animals, the perverted things that carnies do, it was just too much - I wanted to erase that stuff from my brain the moment I read it. That is just not entertaining to me at all. I really did enjoy how the book tied ""what happened"" from the beginning to the end, very nicely. That was very interesting to me and I'm glad I finished it. I could do without all the other crap though."
5,One of the best endings EVER...,"I read this book last year and am sincerely hoping that the movie is able to sufficiently capture the adventure, romance, and poignancy. I not only enjoyed the flashbacks to the days in the circus - I REALLY enjoyed the perspective of the character in a current day nursing home. This book has it all and is written in a way that it easily became a movie in my mind as I read. Many times books like this have sad endings but the ending to this story is excellent! I highly recommend this book."
5,Very Entertaining Book,"A wonderful novel that deftly takes the reader from a spirited old man's hospital room to Circus trains and back again. Based in part on a menage of historic events, Water For Elephants is full of adventure and fantasy. I really enjoyed it."
3,Ok,It was an OK book. I was expecting it to be really great and it didn't really live up to the hype. Maybe the movie is better
1,Water For Elephants,Boring. kept waiting for something good or great and nothing. It just went on and on. I listend to this as an audio book. poor elephant. thats all. one star.
3,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed after all the positive press I had seen and heard. To me the language was too rough. It may have been realistic, but served no purpose to be repeated over and over. Also some scenes were too sexually explicit. Its redeeming quality was the ending of the story. I had to force myself to keep reading. In the end I was glad I did because of the satisfactory (and somewhat surprising)ending. Not a book I would recommend to others."
3,Water for Elephants,I enjoyed reading Water for Elephants. It was the first book I have read using my Kindle and found the information about the book to be just fine.
5,Great book!,"I couldn't put this book down! I got it on my kindle and was reading every night and during the day, I would read on my kindle app for my iphone. this book was so good, I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,Loved it!,"Loved it! This was a really complete story. The characters were fascinating, the setting exotic and the story enthralling from the beginning. The writing didn't get in the way of the story (which I love). I loved the animal characters and their relations with the humans. It had a ""Life of Pi"" vibe, but was more grounded in reality. I got very attached to the main character as an old man (it jumps back and forth - but not in an annoying way - really lends itself to telling the epic of his life while only delving into a few years of it). The author shows restraint describing any suffering of animals and lowly circus workers - which I appreciate - can't stand when they knock you over the head with it. Very well researched, no boring details - just the good stuff :)"
5,Couldn't have been better,"I don't think this story could have been any better than it was. I read it front to back in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down! I don't read reviews before I read a book, I'll read anything I can get my hands on. When I got this book I flipped through it, and I didn't think I'd like it because of the pictures. But after the FIRST page I was hooked. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Jacob and Marlana...and HATED Uncle Al and August. I wanted to cry everytime Auggie went to the tent to lay it on Rosie. It made me sick. It's been a while since I read something so moving! A+++++++++"
5,Great!,Such a good book- I could not put it down. I love the history. I would have never thought I would be interested in the circus.
4,Water for Elephants,I read the book. I could not watch the movie. The book was so good if you could stand the feelings of the circus and what it was doing to him and the love he felt for her.
3,"Not bad, but...","The book wasn't bad, but the plot was entirely predictable and uninspiring, and the character development was feeble at best. Simply caricatures and cardboard cutouts, acting exactly as their stereotypes would suggest.Definitely not a total waste of time, as it's clear the author did her research, but it definitely failed to grab me."
2,"Ok, but why the title? 2.5 stars","I have to say that this book, was very much like a soap-opera. Everything was pretty predictable, and that ruined it. I have no clue why she choose this title, especially since Rosie doesn't play that much of a dominate role, (as was expected). What held this book together was the old Jacob, and just the curiousity, to make sure what you predicted was correct. Overall, I say if your looking for a fast read, enjoy."
3,Asdfg,"A good book. Much better than the movie. Buy this book, it's really good. Okay this is dumb I'm required to give a review, sorry everyone."
1,Boring Read!,"I am sorry, but this book was just boring. The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it. But I did not enjoy it one bit. I was fooled by the high reviews and bought it. Terrible decision!"
4,Enjoyable Read,"A conflicted romance centered around the life of a circus train. Descriptive with well researched circus history. Pure romance entertainment, I hope the movie does it justice."
4,Definitely worth the read. Unlike anything before,"I had such a love hate relationship with this book. I struggled in the beginning that I even wanted to read it, but with all the hype and the movie coming out I figured I should trudge on. Overall, I'm glad I did. After a certain part there really are no dull moments, and lots of plot twists. The writing and character development is phenomenal, although there were a lot of graphic parts that I thought could've been left out and made me not want to continue sometimes (and I'm pretty tough). Towards the end I was flying through it and cannot wait to see how they pull off the movie!"
1,I read the reviews..,"I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book. :("
5,The Elephants and I will never forget this book.,"This was a fantastic story. Jacob Jankowski is a 93 year old man. When the circus pays a visit to the lot across from the Nursing Home he lives in, it takes him back to when he was employed by a circus during the depression. And so the book alternates between today and the 1930's. This book grabbed me from the beginning. Especially since Jacob attended school at Cornell and caught the circus train on it's way to Utica. Places I am very familiar with. The fact that he is Polish is another plus. This story is put together very well. Gruen obviously did her research and I finish this book with some knowledge about Jamaica ginger paralysis, exotic animal behavior and of course, the circus. It is definitely going on my personal list of ""classics"" and ""1001 books to read before you die""."
4,"Slow start, great end","I liked this book, I'm glad I read it. It started off a little slow but it got better around page 100 or so. I would reccommend it."
5,One of the best and most absorbing books I've ever read,"This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down! Not much more to say except wonderful writing and absorbing story line. Also, it's great that the Kindle edition is under $4.50."
4,Water for Elephants,The book was a quick and interesting read. I enjoyed it and would like to read other books by this author.
4,Good story but depressing,"""Water for Elephants"" is a good story but prepare yourself beacause this is no ""feel good"" novel. The novel is written well, just really sad and depressing."
4,Circus Life back in time.,"This book is very amazingly descriptive on how the employees of the carnival survived. It's amazing they did survive, and many didn't. It was a time when redlighting employees meant killing them. It's a story of survival of the fittest with humans and loving animals. It moves ahead in time (sporadically) when the main character is in a nursing home at the age of 93. I really related to this, as my father was in a nursing home for a long time. It's how the main character perceives himself by looking at his hands, as my father did and not looking in the mirror. By losing the ability to walk. A story of a great love that defied all odds. I was slightly disappointed with the end of the story, as it seemed that it suddenly ended with more to find out. I hope the movie portrays the ending in a better way. This story was researched thoroughly."
3,"Nice Read for Some, Maybe Not for Animal Lovers","I read this book because my sister-in-law (who never reads) could not put it down until she finished. So I gave it a go and, after a slow start, was interested enough to finish. The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point."
5,A wonderful story and a great read,This is one of those books you'll want to share. Well written and very interesting as well as entertaining.
4,Best circus novel I've ever read,"It's also the only circus novel I've ever read. This is an entertaining drama novel with a love triangle. The characters are nicely fleshed out, and there is a nice to and fro between Jacob's current life as a ninety year old and his adventures in the circus. Gruen does a charming job of describing Jacob as an old man and the ending is very good. Whilst the book is good I think it has been lucky that it has benefitted from great marketing and a big budget film as there are other books which are more powerful & more deserving than this book that have not received any recognition.Enjoyably recommended."
3,Worth a read,I think really I would give this three and a half stars but because we can't do that I've gone with three. This book was really well written and in turn I was able to picture the characters as clearly as if they were people in the flesh. One particular character August got on my nerves and made me so mad I can't describe but that shows what great writing it was. Good book about how life is travelling with a circus.
3,Hard to follow at times,"I looked at the reviews before purchasing this book - I thought I would love it. As it turned out, I had a hard time getting into the book. Once I finished it, I watched the movie to tie in the parts that I didn't get. It was not horrible, just not my taste."
1,Now I lay me down to sleep,"I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's ""prizes."" This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores. Cover to cover there is nothing in it. It is like reading a cut and paste book. The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing. The same with the dialogue. I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed). I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious. There is no strength to the story or the sentences. I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies. Now there is a circus story you won't forget."
3,Alright,I had quite high expectations based on other reviews provided. Actually I didn't particularly enjoy this book. The writing style didn't quite gel for me and the characters weren't particularly believable.
1,Total waste of time,"A friend gave me this book and highly recommended it. To this day I have no idea what I did to offend her. Whatever it was, she got even by getting me to waste my time with this boring story that had no redeeming value. I kept reading because I expected there to be more to it-ie that somehow it would all come together and the time investment would be rewarded by a clever lesson or a deep meaning. When I finished, I discovered that there was actually less than met the eye- no lesson, no moral, no clever ending. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book--- unless of course you plan to give it to someone who has offended you."
5,What a great book!,Water for Elephants deserves all the hype it has gotten. Terrific story and I could not put it down.
5,Awesome read!,"This is one of the best books I've read in years. It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction. Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic. This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline. I cannot wait until the next book!"
2,NYC book lover,"Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story."
4,Good but not great,"Water for elephants was certainly an entertaining read, but I have read better. It did help to open my eyes to the life of circus performers in the 1920's. This was very well projected throughout the entire book, and it was easy to tell that the author was very well educated on the topic. I do think however that there should be a warning about the sexual content within the book. I would only recommend it for mature readers. I would recommend this book if you have a lot of time to enjoy the context in which it was written."
4,Great read!,"Stayed up all night to get this amazing book finished. Was an excellent read, and now, its being passed around my office to spread the joy with others! :)"
4,Good book,"Had seen the movie a while back, so decided to read the book. I enjoyed both, but book was better"
5,Water For Elephants,"Water For Elephants is by far the best I've read in months. Just amazing. Jacob is funny and entertaining, keeping your attention through the whole story."
5,Love the book even better than the movie,"I saw this movie several months ago and it inspired me to read the book because a friend of mine said the book was even better. I completely agree! Even though I had seen the movie already, it was practically as if I had never seen it at all because there was so much more detail and richness in the book. If you haven't read this book yet, I highly recommend it!"
5,Fast read,A great book if you are looking for a fast read. Kept me interested throughout. A feel good story for all.
2,it was okay,This book was OKAY. I had to read it for school. I don't get how it got such amazing reviews. It wasn't THAT good in my opinion.
3,Depressed Me,"Thank god for a happy ending - the entire book depressed me - the human and animal cruelty, the redlightings, the drinking of Sterno (!?), the depiction of the folks in the ""Assisted Living"" facility (sounded more like a nursing home than ALs I know). I read it in a day and a half just to get through it for book club, but I wouldn't have finished it otherwise.... and I finish virtually every book I start."
3,slow to start but then very good,"This is a 300 page book which took about 200 pages to grab me. It felt like the first 2/3 of this book just created background, letting us know the various characters in the circus and giving us a sense of life in that traveling circus of the 1930s. All of this was well written and interesting, but there was not much of a story until the final 100 pages, or at least it never grabbed me until then. I didn't start to really care about the narrator until then. Those final 100 pages were great fun, and I loved the ending of this book. I recommend this book, but cannot quite give it four stars when I spent most of the book waiting for things to pick up. If you read this, just sit back and enjoy the good portrait of circus life in the depression. Don't be impatient, like me. Eventually, this picks up steam and delivers so well. The ending is one of the best I have read in so long."
4,water for elephants,"captured my interest from chapter one. interesting look at the circuses of the past, as well as a love story. recommended reading"
5,good story,"Good story line, entertaining, The dont like the circus but this has a great story line that,yes has a circus feel but it has a love story, drama and flash backs into the past. Great book."
3,Good not great,"The book is a good book but in no way great. The descriptions of the time period and the circus was great but the story was predictable to excess. The characters were contrived and stereotypical. I did enjoy parts of the story but it is not a great novel, it is merely an entertaining read."
5,Great story!,"This is an excellent story and exceptionally well written. Do yourself a favor and read it, it is outstanding!Water for Elephants: A Novel"
5,A Wonderful & Satisfying Book,"This is a great read, one you can devour---and I don't even like circuses. The reviews piqued my interest and Water for Elephants was even better than I expected. Pleasing on every level---prose style, plot, denouement. Actually you will probably guess part of the ending but it is ever so satisfying. I sat and thought about this one a long time after I finished reading."
4,"Interesting and informative, but not really engaging.","I enjoyed this book; it was like an interesting history lesson or a memoir and I learned a lot about the horrors of living with the circus in the early 20th century. The relationships weren't as well developed as I like, neither were the characters. But the variety of characters made the story very interesting. The concept of Jacob as as old man remembering the circus is a good idea, but I didn't like Jacob as an old man; he was grumpy, self-centered, and aloof. I thought it took Jacob out of character because as a young man he was very mild mannered and pleasant. I don't think that part made the story better."
4,Interesting story,"This is an interesting book. It's well paced and the story keeps pulling you along, although I can't think of a single thing that makes it stand out. It's not mysterious or adventurous and has very little romance in it, yet you keep reading. Maybe it's just plain good story telling."
5,A good read if you can get past a few things,"This story line captivated me from the first chapter. It had ALOT of swearing and graphic sexual content which I didn't enjoy having to wade through and skip over. I didn't think it added anything to the storyline, and felt that it could have been left out all together.I found the author commentaries at the end to be most fascinating. It was interesting to read that the story line has some non-fiction events weaved into it. I you don't mind filthy language and sexual content this is a great read."
4,Water for Elephants,Started off very slow hard to get into the book. Kept persevering and it got better and when I finished found i could have kept reading it.
4,Wow!,"Wow! I purchased all three of Sara Gruen's novels at the same time. The first two because they were equestrian themed(I own 6 horses) and Water for Elephants because it was so highly recommended. I started with the equestrian novels first and found them entertaining but with a literary style much like a typical romance novel. I have spent the last two summers reading only Pulitzer Prize winners, so I guess I look for more in of a novel than I used to. I wasn't expecting much from Water for Elephants but was I pleasantly surprised. I could hardly beleive that this was the same author. From mundane to sublime! Well researched, with interesting characters and a facinating look into a life few of us could even guess at, I found this novel hard to put down. Well done Sara Gruen!"
2,Predictable,Without giving any spoilers away let me say the book is very cliched and predictable and the leading human characters are all undeveloped and quite stereotyped. The animals are perhaps given a little more rounded personalities. The circus portion of the story ends in a fantastic and unbelievable manner and the other story in which our hero is now an old man in a nursing home ends in just as unlikely manner.Yawn.
5,Great read,"If you're looking for a captivating read, look no further. I could not put this one down. Ripped through it in about two days. Hopefully the movie doesn't destroy it!"
3,Good-Not Much More,"Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say ""amazing"", ""best book I've ever read"", etc.?? I don't get that. I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written. It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half. However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype."
5,Water for Elephants,A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book.
3,Interesting but Thin,"My wife and I listened to this on CD and found the subject interesting, and a nice change from crime novels, but I found the writing very ""thin"".Animals run loose, and its a remembered circus disaster by a even smaller circus manager, yet no mention of deaths or injuries are made.Main character elephant is virtually forgotten at the end, along with revealed wife.Highly educated main character drops out of Ivy League school to join circus? Pleassseeee!Workers are casually murdered rather than just being fired?Police have the ability to sell private property? Buyers believe performers when they say the animals are theirs? Please!So plot holes but a generally enjoyable listen to a bit of culture we weren't familiar with.Oh, and circus manager allowing 93 (or 90) year-old escape from assisted-living center? Pleassseeee!"
5,Incredible Illustrations,"A beautifully illustrated comprehensive reference guide for herb usage, planting, caring, drying and medicinal applications. Just incredible!"
3,kinetic sculpture,"The filming of George Rickey's moving sculptures is quite wonderful with nice background music. It was quite disappointing not to have some narrative telling something about Rickey himself, his background, life and thought process. He seems as fascinating as his kinetic sculptures."
2,Flimsy nail file,Very Disappointed because it bends easily and it tears up my nails---I am going to throw it out---I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","The review prior to this sums up my thoughts pretty well, though I did enjoy having a book devoted just to the trails I was hiking. Looking back however, I'm not sure it was THAT great because half the trails are useless for most people.Overall the book lacks new substance and/or locations worth the average visitor's time on Maui.For anyone who really wants to get off the beaten path and hike, I'd suggest Maui Revealed, Maui Mile By Mile, and Maui Trailblazer in that order. All three are excellent guides which include hiking amongst many other great things."
1,JUNK,"I got two bad Milkshake Chorus pedals in a row and said forget it. Too bad, and surprising since the other Danelectro ""DJ"" series pedals I have are just fine."
3,I expected more from a Browning,"I needed a saw to trim limbs when I use my climbing tree stand, saw this item and thought I would take a chance. The saw cuts great, but the handle is very chincy. I would have expected a much better product for the price I paid and having the name Browning on it."
5,Excellent book on buckling of structures,"I used this book to prepare for exams in a graduate course in buckling. I highly recommend it to graduate students in structural engineering. Lots of details on methods used to determine buckling loads. A bit weak on computer methods, but those can be found in Chen's book on semi-rigid frames."
4,Good,I have taken many Psychology classes. This book is clear and well illustrated. There is room for improvement but this is a great textbook.
4,Very Beginnings for very beginners,"This book helped me know what I needed to get started. I like his use of classics in pastel to illustrate the beauty and range of the medium. Excellent tips for beginners from what you need, to creating your own paper for pastel work. It also give good information on how to decide what type of pastels to use - by showing different types in action."
4,Just what I wanted! Just what I expected!,"I just learned of Blind Guardian not too long before I purchased this album. I had ""Nightfall in Middle-Earth"". That was cool, but I wanted something that sounded a little more thrashier. I picked this one up and it was just what I wanted. Thrashy songs filled to the brim with solos accompanied by an orchestral piece, ""Theatre of Pain"", and ""The Bard's Song - In the Forest"" which is Blind Guardian's best ballad in my opinion. Of course their are a couple songs that I don't particularly care for, those being ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""The Bard's Song - The Hobbit"". Anyway, if you're a fan then pick this one up. Fans of both their older and their newer stuff should find something to enjoy here."
4,"Good,good,good","Such a good album.Powerful.Great.Some people talks about Hansi's vocals as a ""less"" to the band,but I think that his vocals give a lot more meaning to Blind Guardian's music.The best songs?Definitely,the classic version to ""Theater of pain"",exquisitely orchestrated,""The quest for Tanelorn"" and ""Somewhere far beyond"".An absolutely enjoyable CD...from beginning to end."
2,Re-recorded hits from 1976,"This budget priced CD from Canada has a cover photo of Herman's Hermits promoting their appearance at the prestigious ""Talk Of The Town"" theatre in London in 1969. This is highly misleading as the CD contains 10 re-recorded hits from 1976 and features bassist Karl Green on lead vocals, not Peter ""Herman"" Noone, who left the group in 1971. Green manages to bring a lot of authenticity to the lead singing, and projects the Manchester style and accent with great enthusiasm. The updated versions of ""I'm Into Something Good"" and ""A Must To Avoid"" are excellent! But if you want to hear the original recordings from the 60's, this is not the CD for you. A total playing time of only 25 minutes and 14 seconds is another disincentive to buy this CD."
4,It Does More Than Warm Butter!,"I just got this for Christmas from my wonderful sister, and I've used it twice already for Christmas dinner. Not only is it the perfect size for ""warming butter"", but it's also perfect for other small epicurean tasks (glaze for the Christmas ham, for example). The only thing I don't like, in spite of its design, is it does not pour very well. But despite that small flaw, I love it and will defintely use it alot."
4,Yay Karaoke Revolution,"This Karaoke game is very fun, although harder than the newer Karaoke Revolution games. You have to be spot on pitch and timing to get a perfect score, so it's a challenge! It may be more frustrating for the tone deaf, but all in all it's good Karaoke times!"
5,Great,"There weren't any bundles available, so we bought this game and a headset (which worked fine). The selection of games is good and current -- good for family entertainment. The rating system seems to be more pitch based than actual vocalization, but it is a great pitch tool for most of us who have a hard time with it. The options are interesting and you really get a good feel for the atmosphere of being on stage."
5,Great!,"This was a great find, and was a gift for my husband! The price was great, the transaction was easy and I would do it again! We are both thrilled with our first amazon deal!"
1,Not Good...Tracks,"Cedarific Cat Litter. Read all the great reviews and purchased at my local grocer. The positive: Controls odors. The cons: Tracks the fine, dust like, cedar grinds (not chips). Also, isn't scoopable but I don't think it claims to clump. I want a litter that not only controls odor but is also natural/organic that if digested won't harm, the litter not to track all over the house (I even have a litter box house) and be scoopable/clumping, biodegradable and/or flushable. Was using Swheat Scoop, which I LOVE but it is made of wheat and my cat has a wheat, corn, grain allergy. So the hunt continues....Any suggestions?"
3,cedar chips,It took too much of the product to keep cleaning the pans. It smelled bad from urine unless I changed all the litter every day. It was very easy to handle though because of the products light weight. I have more than 1 cat so it wasn't economical.
3,Not the right materials,"I bought this shirt for a pirate costume. It looks and feels very authentic, but the material is more like gauze than fabric.I tried the shirt on twice to make sure that it would work with the costume, and it looks very nice. However, the third time I tried it on the seams on the side had ripped through the thin material. Not a little, but like extra-arm-holes sized rips. For the actual party (and the first time I wore the costume out of the house) I had to safety-pin the shirt together.It is also just a little too sheer. Do not plan to wear on a cold night without an undershirt (which takes away from the authenticity) or a jacket.I recommend the shirt because there are no better alternatives on the market, but don't plan on wearing this for more than a party or two."
2,Gunked Up,"This pan is impossble to clean and non-stick in name only. Any oil, fats, or liquids of any kind get lodged in the spaces between the searing ridges. I have tried every way to clean it. It is not more efficient than a cast iron grill pan."
1,"Icky, sticky, and yuck","Let me start by saying I have dry skin and allergies. I had hoped this product would give me some relief. It didn't. It compounded my misery. It caused me to break out in pimples (not a usual visitor to my face) and irritated my skin with angry red spots. When I tried to redeem my investment by using it as a hand/arm cream it was so sticky I couldn't tolerate it. If you want to feel as if you were covered in a combination of mayonnaise and Gorilla Glue buy it, otherwise, take a pass."
2,Greasy and itches ...,"I was surprised when I bought this product that it did not suit me at all !!! I did not find it light as advertised ; in fact it left my face feeling very greasy after applying it. Plus for some reason my skin started to itch after I wore it. So now I am using it on my hands and legs. What a waste !! I have used other Neutrogena products - their moisturizer, oil free with SPF moisturizer , the ultra sheer sun screen etc and have never had a problem with any of them. This was the first disappointment from neutrogena for me. Plus I now have to hunt again for a good hydrating night time moisturizer ! :("
5,Still Up To Date,"I first read this little gem back in the mid-70's. I had been caught up in a Charismatic based ""Discipleship"" group where more attention was being paid to the human leaders than to God. And even though the Christian leaders who started it all have broken up as a group (some of them are no longer among the living)there are still a lot of authoritarian groups around.The author shows that ""The Pendulum Swings"" back to a more balanced, Biblical view on many issues. I especially appreciated his view on excessive authority in general (he doesn't go along with it). He also zeroes in on how this has hurt women in the church, and advocates taking a realistic view and allowing them to minister more.In all, it's good to read. If you can get ahold of it and read it, you'll be glad you did."
1,it's a crap! dont buy it!,"bad sewed, many imperfections and i am not sure if are made by natural leather! i try to returned!! and also are made in CHINA!!"
4,Those are great boots,"Those are great boots, but when I order them I didn't take the time to look at the size. So I ordered size 15,5 and not 15. But they are good boots."
1,Were not all 5!!!,"This has got to be the most babyish game ive everplayed. I mean slime, foodfights, what is this??? You should buy this game from ages 5-10. Otherwise this is a big :("
3,not much fun,I am a little disapointed in this game.I didn't have much fun with it nether did the kids.the games are to easy. Random & you just run around. not much fun.
1,Mario party 6 is so much better than this.,Get Mario party 6 this game sucks so bad it's bad for kids . Shooting slime destroying property is the wrong message to children. MARIO PARTY GAMES ARE THE GREATEST PARTY GAMES KNOWN TO MANKIND!!! BOO and MARIO CARACTERS are so much better than nickelodon characters. SEE my Mario party 6 review it says GET IT NOW find it. Mario party 6 is so much better don't buy this buy mario party 6 instead.BUY MARIO PARTY 6 NOW!!! Nickelodeon is jelous! BUY MARIO PARTY 6 NOW!!!
3,Falling Stockings,"I couldn't use the Jobst Thigh High, it was without the elastic band to hold up the Stocking. I returned the item. Other than that the Quality was good."
3,"Okay, okay","Okay, okay, I will buy almost any type of baking pan on the market but this is really rather ordinary. There are many other pans that have more sophisticated shapes or are just more serviceable, such as 12 cup muffin pans."
4,"Great product for making ""sun"" balls","I was making a birthday cake with a planets theme and needed to have a sun for the planets to revolve around. This was the only product that fit the bill. The sun turned out perfect and was the right size for my 14 inch round cake. The product, as with most Wilton products, was easy to clean. The only negative I can state is there are six mini balls, and I only used one for my project. Am hoping in the future I can use all six for another cake."
2,basics,"this is well written, as are all the ""idiots"", but be warned it is very basic to the point of intuitive. but if you have never been camping it is a great read."
5,WOW!!!!,"Wow! I am a HUGE fan of the anime and let me tell you, the manga is no let down. It totally captures that intriguing mood of the series, which I at first didn't think was possible! :) I am 100% satisfied! This is a wonderful book that any Cowboy Bebop fan should read. You won't be dissapointed. :)"
4,Likely good,"I was shocked when I saw the price tag usually new manga is alot more expensive but this isn't a bad price. I heard alot about Cowboy Bebop the anime series, but never got around to watch it. When I went shopping the other day I saw this manga at the store and descided to get it. I liked it! The art and characters where great! I had some good laughs in a couple of the chapters. I think I found myself a new manga series. So go buy it! You will like it!"
5,FANTASTIC!,"I think the manga is GREAT!ANY BEBOP FAN WILL ENJOY IT!The stories are original and the art is EXCELLENT,Any Bebop fan should pick it up!!!! :D"
3,BCCI's a thrilling book,"When I first purchased ""A Full Service Bank: How BCCI..."" I was thinking that it is a long boring book, but when I started to read it I was amazed on what BCCI actually pulled off and how they did such things. The governments and banking systems in other countries also intrigued me. ""A Full Service Bank"" is an exciting book that keeps the reader engaged for a long amount of time and keeps them interested. When you are done reading this novel you should feel a sense of knowledge. I suggest ""A full Service Bank"" to anyone interested in the banking industry or interested in a great book about scandles andn banks."
3,Informative and engaging,"Adams gives the reader an in-depth look at BCCI's rise and fall. He looks at the bank's often shady business practices, and examines why such a worldwide institution failed so spectacularly.This book does a great job of presenting BCCI's rise and fall. There has obviously been painstaking research done to present an accurate portrait of the situation at BCCI. The institutional corruption and disregard for ethics or banking regulations is shown time and time again. There are stories here about bank managers instructing depositors in how to defraud the system, the acceptance of deposits from dictators and drug lords, and the attempt to circumvent US banking regulators to open branches on the East Coast. It is a compelling story from not only a business standpoint, but also from a historical one.I did not read the bit about the FBI's sting of BCCI. The part of the book I did read was well researched, albeit dry in some parts."
5,Touching,The book and the video are both amazing. The stories of those people touched me and uplifted me at the same time. Highly recommended. It really got to the heart of the matter.
5,REALLY GREAT FOR ALL RELIGIONS,"I have sent this viedo, audio, and book to several friends who have been through the awful tradegy of losing a child. I know nothing can be worse. It uplifts them in a way that people can't by knowing the right things to say to those who are grieving in such a painful way. I would recommend this to anyone who doubts God's way of turning tradegy into victory."
5,hawley,"Good Laptop to purchase, with excellent condition.it contain everything that I wanted .I would love to buy it again when avaliable."
2,guide to owning a cocker spaniel,"This book aritcle didnt have the informationtion that I was searching for. My Dog is not for show and Ive had her nuetered so she isnt for breeding. She is a pet for my three grandsons and I was looking for in formation on the dogs health problems, such as cataracs, hip didplacement and why do they get the gunk in the corners of their eyes and the best way to train my spaniel to obey meThis article is designed mostly for breeders and show dogs"
2,Full of Parabens!,"I used to really like this item until I became more conscious of what I was putting on my skin, started reading the ingredients and was very dissapointed to find it's full of parabens! until they change they ingredients, I'm saying good bye to this!"
4,Love the lotion,"I love this lotion- it stays on through a hand washing and it sinks in well. However they changed the lid on it recently to a screw on lid (used to be a flip top) and I dinged it a star for that. The new lid is VERY cumbersome (big lid, tiny hole to match up to the screw thingy). I am always dropping them on the floor!Anyway the lotion is great if you are constantly washing your hands!"
3,Good but not a incredible,"This, in and of itself, did not keep keep my hands from cracking (e.g. at the ends of my fingers) when only applying it once at the end of the day. It'll be -6 today for a high (Minnesota) so it's quite dry where I am. I also might wash my hands more than most folk. I find I have to apply hand lotion after every time I wash my hands. For that I use a cheaper, no frills one (Vaseline Intensive Care), which also wouldn't be enough if applied just once a day. I can carry the latter in a refillable squeeze bottle (REI sells them)."
4,Its a cover.,"For the price you'd think this lid could do amazing things but it just sits on top of your pot. Warning- it does not fit securely on the 10"" commercial griddle/crepe pan. I guess there are other more appropriate 10"" covers or this pan should never be covered, however, I like to use this pan for fried eggs and I like to cover them while they cook. It works but its not a true fit. So look at the box to see which pans its made for before you purchase this lid."
3,Too Hot to Handle,"The PC crowd is howling! All the glittery literati loved Ms. Chute until she went out and betrayed them by depicting a militia-man, Drummond, as civilized and, indeed, noble. Drummond is a militia-man who knows the world and hates it for good reasons. He is totally unlike the dim-witted monsters the Left would have us believe in. This novel is worth the price only for Chute's fire-breathing sermons from the mouth of her heroic assassin."
4,"Nice collection of SBB's ""the bests""","If you are interested in the best progressive rock and ""philhamonic"" jazz-rock made in Poland in 1970-ies and 1980-ies, this CD is just for you. The pieces put together on this CD make some imagination about how the guys played like. You will hear that they loved their job!Every SBB fan has his/her own top-list and the program of the CD could be put under debate, but it anyway gives a good overview of SBB's music, which is simply great and deserves to be known better. If these guys were born in the UK, they would be as famous as Pink Floyd or Procol Harum. But they were doing their job behind the Iron Curtain, a kind of curse for everyone down there.Just take and enjoy!"
3,A New-Age adaptation of Jungian Archetypes,"I found ""Goddess Within"" quite illuminating, as I haven't read much Greco/Roman mythology - yet. I'm not of the same belief system as the authors, and at times found that an impediment, but was able to read around those limitations and learn quite a bit. It does indeed help with insights into personality types and the ways they may change over a woman's life. Not a bad introduction to mythology and archetypes, if this is up your alley in terms of your area of interest."
3,Okay,"Got it for my son. He used to take it when he was younger and it seemed to help somewhat. Not a cure, but it did seem to help decrease to amount of migraines. Not sure it is helping as much now. Doesn't t help me at all."
3,good product,"My friend says it really helps her headaches, but I took it for a month or so and could not notice a difference. However, I know my headaches are from my jaw and I'm not sure any supplement will do much for that."
1,Ditto on the Prosine Inverter / Charger,"I'll second the previous review on the Inverter / Charger unit. I've had one on our boat for about 2 years now, and it's been nothing but a headache.It doesn't completely crash, but we frequently arrive at the dock to discover that it has shut itself down. It works again when we switch it off and then on again, but it is very, very annoying to have to do this almost every time we go out sailing (if not more than once).This product clearly has some big problems - indeed, the reason I found this product on Amazon is that I've started to look for a replacement. Does anyone have any ideas??"
3,It's just a spatula,"I have used better, and at (...) us it's a little more than i'd normaly pay. but it works."
5,excellent for beginners through experts,I found this book very informative about feature writing. I believe that Daniel Williamson did a very good job putting this book together. It flows very well from chapter to chapter leaving no room for speculation. The exercises in the back of each chapter are very help full if you don't understand what you just read. The exercises make you analyze the strengths and weakness in a feature article in your local newspaper. Another good thing about this book is that it is very in depth. He explains all parts of feature writing from the gathering info for your story or explaining what the body of the story should be. My favorite part of the book is that it will give you hypothetical information and show how to write a feature article based on the information. If you are looking for a book to help you write better feature articles this book is the one for you.
1,How much the novel Baldur's Gate suxs,I think the novel is not worth your money. The plot made no sense and kills off almost all the other players in the game except the main Abdel and Jahira. They killed Kaliid<cryes>
1,Awful awful awful.,"This book was terrible. The end of the book read as though it had been written by a five-year-old. It just STOPPED. ""OK, so I'm fighting with my brother who is eviler than me, and oops, he's dead, the end."" The rest of the story was no better. No character development, and what development was attempted actually made me understand the characters less. Don't waste your money. Read ""White Plume Mountain"" from the Greyhawk series instead. It's a short, quick story, but at least the humor works and the ending is interesting."
4,Great for the basics.,"It is a good book for review of the very basics of microbiology, prefect for someone how is not a science major and is just fulfilling a G.E. class. I am a microbiology major and it was fun, but not detailed enough to be really informative. Would still buy it again and I have used it for basic review."
3,"Great text, mediocre illustrations","I have heard Charlie Meck talk, and I know what authority he brings to his subject. I bought this book with the expectation that I could pick up some of his tricks. Unfortunately, the illustrations are small, dark, and very poorly reproduced. The publisher obviously skimped on quality to keep the price down, and it was not a good decision!Compared to some of the other excellant tying books on the market, this is not a volume that will help the intermediate tyer in search of advanced techniques. I was disappointed."
2,Mediocre at best,"It's just not good, a huge disappointment. The tea is bland with almost no flavor to it. I've tried 8 of the 12 blooms so far, all of them have had the same problem. The first six I tried they had no taste, it was like drinking warm water, so I ended up adding loose tea to the infuser. The last two I brewed together, and that came out good. That said you can't steep them 3 times each, I couldn't even steep the two at once twice. It advertises 12 blooms with 36 steeps so that is absolutely false. I also purchased Primula TMV-2012 Flowering Green-Tea, it looks like the same product with pick label. I haven't tried it yet, but I don't have high hopes. I don't recommend this to anyone."
2,Not impressed....,"Average to below average blooming tea for the price. This blooming tea, in my hands, requires a 3 cup teapot if you desire great presentaion. If you use a smaller 6-8oz teapot the bloom falls to the side, floating on the top. Unfortunately, in a larger pot you get better presentation but you sacrifice flavor ending up with weak tea. I haven't tried using two at once in the larger pot which might solve the issue. Another idea would be to use a narrow, tall cylindrical teapot."
4,Cathy Willingham,"I sent this to my Mother for Mothers Day and the tea pot for for her birthday. They are very close together. I wanted to send her something that would remind her of one of her trips to Seattle - one that she and I had shared. She loved it, not only the tea and tea pot but also the sentiment."
3,Ok,"Worked for its purpose, but once I went to unplug and move it, the ground pin came out and separated. Not sure if it works properly now, due to the ground pin being broke.Nice concept though."
1,"Worked fine at first, now unreliable",I used this to plug a heat lamp in my chicken coop. I've only been using it for about 2 months and it started getting stuck in the on position even when the temperature was up in the 50s and now its not coming on below 35.
5,About to order another,I bought 2 of these a month ago even though we have not had very cold weather this winter here in TN the nights that did freeze they work nice. I installed one for a light on my chickens water and it has kept them drinking also one in my well pumphouse which also worked well. My friends are all wanting one. I like others wonder why they dont sell them in other popular stores?
2,Not sure,"It hasn't come on but once because of the low tempearture required, so not sue if it really works or not."
3,Thermocube,Product is as advertised. Outlet was bought for my two dogs heat lamp.I have'nt really used it much but it seems fine. I would have rather had one that came on at 45 degrees instead of 35.
2,Won't fit my outdoor outlet.,"Loved the concept, but I question its use in outdoor outlets. It won't fit in mine - the configuration is wrong; it seems to be set up to fit typical indoor outlets. Might be great in a garage or basement. Two stars, not for the concept, but because it didn't fit my standard outdoor outlet and there was nothing in the product information or package about this."
1,"Bought two, both failed.","I bought two of these outlets. I put one in the greenhouse when it was warm. The temperature dropped to 25F and the heater was not on when I went out there. I put the other outlet on a heating pad I use to keep my pipes from freezing. It was working on the heating pad and when I moved it to the greenhouse the heater worked at first. The temperature in the greenhouse began dropping again, I checked the heater, and this outlet had failed also. I would not buy these and hope to get a refund on these."
1,Thermo Cube TC-3,"Thermo Cube TC-3 Failed after 2 days use with a 150 watt light,not recomended!.....jh in PA"
1,They don't work,"I bought three of these. Only one of them works. The other two don't ever come on, even at 0 degF. Do not buy! They are junk!"
1,An utter failure,I purchased the Thermo Cube TC-2. I am very handy around the house. This product never did work from the start. Very disappointing. I didn't think it was worth my time and trouble to return it for a refund. I didn't do anything wrong with it; perhaps it was a factory defect.
3,Works but not accurately,"I've tested it turning on a light in a machine shed. It has been turning the light on/off but I've seen it go as high as 40 in the building before shutting the lamp off. This isn't a big deal for what I'm using it for but if it really needed to go on/off as a specific temp, it might not be a good choice."
1,Not what we expected,"This doesn't function as we'd hoped it would. It turns on well below 32 degrees & doesn't turn off until it reaches at least 55--sometimes even more! We purchased it for use with a solar array in our chicken coop, and ditched the idea as it ended up using way too much amperage. Since it kept chickens' waterer's heater on too long, we would've needed an extra (expensive) battery just to use this product. Not happy with it at all"
5,works as designed,I am currently using 3 Thermo Cubes. Two are used to keep my water well connections from freezing. The third controls a heat lamp for my german shepard.
1,Does not work,"This is a disappointing product. I read the reviews before buying because I need something to turn off the fan in my greenhouse when it gets below 70. The fan ran all day for two days straight even though the temps dropped considerably. Twice I checked the temperatures in the morning and it was 67 and 65, but the fan was still running."
2,Poorly made and poorly designed,"The prongs diverge as they come out of the back of the outlet, making it very hard to fully plug the unit into a socket. The ground prong diverges away from the power prongs, which is not really fixable by bending the prongs. Because it is two sockets wide, it will not plug into most outdoor sockets that have weather caps. Another person suggested getting a different weather cover for your existing sockets, but why go to the expense and trouble of reconfiguring your outlets just to accommodate a poorly designed control that only costs $12 in the first place? Plus, by protecting the unit from rain, you might also influence the thermostat in the unit, making it slower to respond to cold weather. In fine print on the package it says not to use this product unless you have it on a circuit protected by ground fault circuit interrupter. Good for them, since the unit is not waterproof and is intended to be used outdoors."
3,Not safe for outside use,"This product works well as far as turning on and off when it should, however, beware if you want to use it outside! If the outlet is exposed to rain and snow, ie if it's not under a big overhang or mounted on your soffit, it needs a cover. There are 2 basic kinds of covers; non in-use covers (flat flip covers) and the in-use covers(the big bulky clear plastic boxes.). With the flip cover type, you have to remove the ""door"" in order for this to plug in, however, then it is exposed to the elements. With the inuse boxes, it will NOT fit inside one of these! It is too wide.So, basically, this item works for turning things on and off, but it's not safe for outside use in most cases.I hope someone can redesign one of these, because I have two exterior uses which need one--roof cables and a birdbath heater."
1,ground doesnt fit,"I don't mind a product that works... but this ones doesn't. The prongs in the back are cheaply fastened and ground wouldn't even fit into my extension cord. So basically, this product was a waste of money."
2,"Terrible story, borderline hentai","This was a very bad novel. It has all the elements of a robot girl hentai except it has a more lovey-dovey storyline. CLAMP can draw beautifully but their character personalities are shallow. The more I read, the worse it got. I was really hoping CLAMP would pull off a good ending, but I was left disappointed."
1,"NOT for kids or anyone under 18, IMHO",I opened the first book in the book store and shut it immediately. Disgusting! But if you are into that stuff...and can get past the first page...then maybe you can judge for yourself.
4,chobits,this manga is hillarrious! But deffently go by the age guidlines some kids may find the adult hummor to be a bit to much. But all in all it's fun to read about someone who has the worst luck. Though sometimes confusing (Chi's books for example) Chobits is one of the best manga series i've read in a long time!
4,Good spatula,"As with most Calphalon, I like this spatula. I is a very good price and does its job well. I give it 4 stars because it can get a little wobbly, buut not any worse than another one I have used."
2,frayed edges,"This spatula works fine but the edge begins to fray after a while, makes it hard to clean. I use with cast iron skillet or stainless steel pan; it's probably better suited for non-stick pan use only."
3,Flintstone Pack,If you are a Flintstone fan - the first movie is a treat - bringing the characters to life and reminding us of the original story line. The sequel can be tossed.
3,Too big and short span.,"I find this utensil to be longer than I would have liked and perhaps clumsier than it should have been, but the main complain I have is the tight span between the two extremities at full open position, I think it just isn't wide enough for a comfortable grab."
2,No way with hot oil!!,"I bought these because I love Calphalon pans and thought all of there products would be as high quality. Unfortunately, as I was frying tortillas to use in tostadas I couldn't pick up the tortilla to turn it over. Yet, when the tongs were cool they worked fine.... tried them again in hot oil and same result. Can't use these in very hot situations such as frying in oil."
4,Really love this game,"LOVE this game. Got it at the request of my then 10 year old son who had played it at a friends house. I was addicted immediately. We played it so much that both of my kids are sick of it, which makes me very sad b/c i still love it -- so much that I bought the ipod version and used to hide while i played it so my kids wouldnt take over.Only 4 stars b/c I think the company used to make expansion packs and other maps that improve and vary the game, but i dont think these are available anymore. This is too bad, b/c there is so much one could do with this concept -- maps of Africa, Asia, the US, we particularly wanted the map of India since that is where we are from and the railroad system there is very central to life. We have the european version and my kids learned a lot about european geography. I think a couple different versions might be available but not everything that I had originally seen."
3,"Its a good game, but gets old quickly","It is an expensive game, so you would expect you would have fun for longer. After a while, strategy becomes obvious. I feel there is much more to it in games like Catan or Power Grid. I would skip ticket to ride, not worth the value. Buy it in iphone and ipad, much cheaper."
5,g-man,The game is lots of fun! Our family has played tournaments together to see who can win the most games! This game is challenging & a great family game to play together!!
5,Even More Fun than the Original!,"We bought this game because my sister has the original game, but wanted a different variation of it. It has just enough differences to make it more interesting without being too difficult. My 12 year son loves to play it with us and we have introduced it to many other people, ranging in age from 15 to 74 and they liked it too! We took it with us on vacation and it was perfect for those ""in between"" times when nothing was going on. I never heard ""I'm bored"" on our trip. We even found places to play it in the airport while on layovers. The game arrived quickly after I ordered it."
2,Not much fun,"A friend recommended this, explaining that he and his wife love the game and play it almost every night...sometimes for 15 minutes, sometimes for an hour.Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I cared for it. It's kinda' complicated to learn at first (lots of rules, but even after we got the hang of it....it still wasn't fun.It's been in the closet, untouched for 6 months now."
1,Scent isn't there,"None of the amazing grace products either have no scent or the scent doesn't last. I fist bought the super size bath gel and lotion set and they smell great, but doesn't last. I decided to buy the perfume spray thinking layering would help make the scent last....not. I bought the conditioner to even try further to make the scent last....that didn't work because the conditioner doesn't even smell like amazing grace and it's not very good conditioner."
3,wanting more,This was a very short and non detailed instruction. i have tried this technique and bought the video to try toget some more instruction. 1. There was alot of talking without specifics. what is the difference between a good and not so good welding iron for this specific technique. 2. the camera focused on the person talking and not on the product. we did not get close ups of the technique or the products produced. this is a technique that has a lot of applications. we did not get to see any of thatwhat was most disappointing is that I know these two are experts in what they do but i was unable to get that from this video nor did i really partake of their knowledge. How is it to put yourself in a beginner's mind and then teach from that place as opposed to just showing what you know about something.
5,A heart warming DVD,This DVD is incredible. It's so great to be able to watch in our home how many people felt about Steve Irwin. It's heart warming and it helps you to know just what a great man he was and how important it is for his work to go on.
2,Not What We Thought,My son really wanted this movie...basically it is his memorial service. My son thought he was getting a Steve Irwin Croc Hunter type show...it's not bad...it's just not what we thought.
2,"Ugh, bristles!","If the bristles didn't fall out during the first few uses, this MIGHT be a good pastry brush! Save your money and go for something more durable."
1,Bristles in my food!,"I've used this brush twice. Both times I spent far too long picking bristles out of my food. I never ran it through the dishwasher and only treated it with the gentlest of care, but that did not prevent the bristles from falling out. Williams-Sonoma has a real winner in their store, check there before wasting your money on this product."
3,"Well Made, No Lids, Pricey","I ordered these since Cooks Illustrated gave them high marks. These are made of high quality commercial plastic and the handles make it easy to hold. If you buy the lid, it seals well and has a tab to help open it. This is good quality and well made.My problem is that these are very expensive. Amazon's pricing is $11.20 for a 4 qt model with one lid for $6.70. So to have a 4 qt covered container you're paying almost $18 per container.My original idea was to use these to organize all the different flours in my pantry, but given the cost I may have to rethink that idea."
5,A wonderful eye-opener regarding epigentic inheritance,I was floored by this book. I've had to abandon (or rather enlarge) the gene-centered view of inheritance and evolution that I'd become comfortable with and embrace this new perspective. Nature is far more complex and subtle than the textbooks would indicate.
5,This CD blew me away!,"I can only reemphasize the comments made by everyone else. This is a totally unique, beautiful, haunting CD that is a must for any true music lover. Put on your headphones, close your eyes, and crank this up. Fantastic!"
3,Okay but no marvel,"I hate to dispute what everyone is saying and perhaps I'm missing something but I have pretty good taste in music. I agree that it has a similarity to David Gray, but comparisons to Jeff Buckley or the great Tom Waits seem a bit too over the top. Yes, some of the lyrics are quite interesting and a tune here and there struck me. But overall, I feel like Tom Mcrae's voice is a little too whispery and weak for me- it always sounds like it is straining. And like he is not powerful enough to just sing the songs instead of kind of whining them out. Don't get me wrong- it's not a bad cd but upon listening over ten times, I'm still not at all overwhelmed. It's nice to have but I don't think I would notice if someone stole my copy."
2,"Big, big disappointment from Gerber","I bought one of these knives at Bass Pro several years ago. While it is a Gerber, it is one of the imports--not one of the domestic Gerbers that made the reputation. The blade sharpens easily and holds an edge fairly well. but after little use, I stopped using this knife and put it away. The problem is the liner lock. It does not securely lock the blade in place. A bump or twisting motion disengages the lock and that is Not A Good Thing. This happens often with cheaply made liner lock knives and this Gerber is no exception.While my knife seems to be fairly well made except for the locking mechanism, a friend of mine had one that was so sloppily built the blade rattled when in the locked position. When I saw his knife I told him he probably should get something made better. The next time I saw him, I gave him one of my Spyderco knives so he wouldn't continue to use this poorly made Gerber.If you have one of these, be careful with it."
4,horror and suspense in the CA desert,"The Slab gives Jeff Marriotte' Desperado and Angel, etc., fans a chance to see what he can do when writing prose in a universe of his own creation. There's a lot going on in this book -- some good, some evil, most weird and magical. A young woman is on the run from a group of twisted hunters. People living in the middle of nowhere are in danger of losing their homes, their lives, and maybe the rest of humanity along with them. The great artwork complements Marriotte's descriptives nicely."
1,Not good for skimming,"The slots are easier to clean than some brands' holes but they are too large for skimming foam/crud from stock/etc. Instead, I use a small plastic mesh screen (about 6"" long and [inexpensive] from the local supermarket) which fits neatly inside a deep stock pot--something that all the long-handled ones won't do.The Calphalon skimmer gets occasional use stir-frying, but you do have to be careful since temperatures can exceed 400 oF. Also, I found that all the Calphalon tools tend to get a little ""limp"" when hot."
2,"compared to other Calphalon products, this is just ""so-so""","We got this utensil free as part of a Calphalon promo when we purchased a set of their pots and pans (which we highly recommend), and I must confess that we get way more use from the other Calphalon products that we own than we do from this utensil.The function of this skimmer is too specific to be used for anything other than skimming and it doesn't always do a good job of that. The size of the scoop is excellent, but the width of the slots seem to be too wide to productivly skim on a consistant basis. We sometimes use this for scooping pasta, but any regular slotted spoon can accomplish that just as well. If you want a good quality Calphalon utensil, try the very multi-functional ""stir fry scoop"", which I would rate 5 stars. We use that ALL the time!"
3,It works... but..,I like this product and normally I support anything Shure brand (love the mics). The popper screen is effective and does work. However its made rather ceaply and tends to not attach well the the stand and fall apart! Good thing to have if you are singing!
2,Somewhat outdated and little info on Park,"I was a little disappointed in the book as it did not meet our needs. I was most interested in ""inside"" info for Olympic National Park such as cool areas off the beaten track and insight into specific campgrounds. However, this book provided nothing beyond what you can easily find on the internet such as number of campsites, bathrooms, etc.The one time we tried to use the book to find a place to eat (in Forks), we were told that the restaurant that book highly suggested had closed down 2 years ago.Those who are going to the Peninsula to visit the towns (not the Park) might find this book a good and useful buy, but certainly did not meet our expectations."
2,"Works okay, smells awful","This lotion does a decent job of moisturizing, but it doesn't absorb very well and no matter how much I try to rub it in there's always a thin pale layer on the surface of my skin -- not attractive! My bigger issue with this product, however, is its sickly-sweet odor. I don't normally mind scented lotions, but this stuff just smells terrible. For the price there are definitely more effective, less stinky moisturizers out there."
2,better releases available for same price,"to get a good quality, single-disc collection of the original recordings of some of Merle Haggard's greatest music, ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is good, as is the budget cd ""Best of the Best"" also on Capitol (avoid similarly titled releases on different labels)...to really do Merle Haggard's legacy justice, easily the best single purchase currently available is the multi-label box set compilation called ""Down Every Road"""
1,Misleading,"As someone who has studied serial killing cases, I know just about everything there is to know about the Yorkshire Ripper murders, and started watching this because that's what the description led me to believe it was about. This has nothing to do with the Ripper. Peter Sutcliff never killed children-the youngest was 16 and he said it was a mistake because she looked much older. So at the very least the description should say nothing about the Ripper at all, and everything about a series of killings in the area and police corruption. I stopped watching so I have no comments about the quality really, but I am disappointed."
5,WORKS GREAT!,THIS IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER NOSE STRIPS I'VE TRIED. WORKS GREAT IF YOU WET THE STRIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR NOSE. YOU'LL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE. GOOD LUCK!
1,USELESS,Does not do anything..not one black head or WHITE head even on the strip after it's removed!it doesn't do anything seriously & to think i bought a BRAND namewaste...
4,Good Book!,This is Thomas Williams third book in the series. It's a good story and you won't be able to put it down.
1,Not real silver,"Im actually 23 yrs old but wanted my name anonymous.This was bought for me as a gift and after wearing it for 2 months the ""silver"" started rusting.I took it to a jeweler and the guy said its not real silver.DO NOT buy this necklace. Its NOT real silver. And now I have to throw that necklace away because its all rusted now."
2,Go with the hard-anodized instead!,"The nonstick version of calphalon is really for those who aren't very serious about cooking. Part of the charm of Calphalon - esp. the professional hard anodized line - is that it is incredibly durable and can be subjected to the kind of abuse I find in my restaurant kitchen. The no-stick stuff has to be treated with kid gloves: you can't use real utensils and have to get those plasticky nylon things, you can't properly deglaze the pan (a huge issue if you do any French cooking), etc.And anyway, the hard-anodized stuff cleans up really well in itself. Even in the worst-case, charred scenarios, simply put some hot soapy water in it and let it soak awhile, and stuff'll come right out. I've had my set for many years, and it's still like new. Non-stick stuff - even Calphalon's - just doesn't have that kind of lifespan."
4,Go commercial instead...,"After owning a Professional Nonstick II saute pan for about two years and raving about it, the nonstick surface has started to wear out, with an increasingly sticky center (arggh!). I will probably have to take advantage of that Lifetime Warranty. However, I now have bought the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 12"" pan, which is also occasionally on special for around 25 bucks. The Commercial Nonstick line has the superior LRS3 nonstick coating compared to the cheaper LRS coating on the Professional line. It tends to cost a little more, but it's worth it.Believe me, it makes a difference!So, go commercial, you won't be disappointed."
1,Thing only worked for 1 month,"Dealing with COBY is a nightmare, got this thing as a gift, from direct tv, they will not honor the warranty, i get differing stories each time i called their customer service, none of which was in my favor because i didnt have a receipt, ITS A FREE GIFT, they were asking for documents that Direct TV does not provide.The player quit working after 3 weeks. and i only played it for a grand total of 3 hours cumulative"
5,Awesome dry-wick shirt,"I've been trying out a bunch of different athleticwear and this is a great shirt for working outor any other athletic activity. Fits great,feels great, effectively wicks sweat. Great value too."
4,My son loved it.,I bought this for my 10 year old son who has been hounding me for 2 years to get it for Halloween. It held up better than expected. I suggest treating it with care though. I thought it might leak etc but it didn't. The black ring rubber gasket had fallen out of it's place on the end of the pump heart when we unpackaged it but I figured out where it went instead of tossing it and I'm thinking that helps keep it from leaking. He is looking forward to replacing the blood next year with food colored purple water or something else as indicated in the instructions as an option. He really loved this mask.
2,Not the best Burning Man pictures . . .,"The pictures in this book were disappointing, so I returned it. The narrative re: Burning Man seemed somewhat interesting (I read a couple of pages); however, that wasn't enough to motivate me to keep the book."
3,If only I could understand!,"As a 3rd year undergraduate studying composition, I cracked open this book, only to find jibberish. As soon as you begin it jumps into a language hierarchical graphic analysis. Maybe I didn't give the book a chance, but I think this book has a very steep learning curve, and assumes lots of background in analysis. Why can't they teach advanced analysis in undergraduate programs?"
4,Golden Berries,Gold Berries is a nice fat burner that you can eat with almost anything. I heard about fromDr. Oz and I am berry happy with it.
1,"Sour, hard and bad batch","I just got these and they taste bad. I have both Navitas suppliers from Amazon and the batch from both in the 400's.These are hard, very sour (supposed to be sweet and sour and soft). I will keep looking for better supplier.There is a reason these are cheaper."
5,Very Addicting...,"The first one I tried I wasn't sure what to think of it. I got a lot of different flavors and textures all at once. I first thought it was soft and chewy, then tasted sweet, then sour, leaving you then with a little bit of a crunch due to there being small seeds inside the goldenberry. the seeds are easy to chew so those aren't a problem. the combination of flavors and textures makes this berry addicting! Goldenberries are about the size of a large raisin. Because of the seeds I don't think small kids would like this, the sour taste with the texture of being left with the seeds would be too weird for the little ones. but great for adults or any health minded individual, this is a good alternative to candy. I've eaten some everyday since I got them in the mail!"
3,"Good quality, but made me break out","This product is pretty good stuff, but steer clear of it if you break out easily. It made me break out all the time I've been using it. I didn't know where the sudden extra breakouts came from, so I switched foundations, powders, even cleansers. It turned out it was this - iy heavily clogged my pores and caused alot of unusual breakouts. It's good for skin that barely ever breaks out - it moisturizes and protects great though."
1,Can't stand the heat.,"Before I go on, let me say I have lots of Calphalon products and only have had a disappointment in this utensil and the whisk. Same reason on both, they are wimpy & overheat, not as in getting to hot to handle, but they become to weak to use. They do not hold up well under heat. When you are stirring the pasta, the fork bends and sways with water. I had pulled some pasta out and left the fork to cool on the spoon rest, when came back the fork had cooled into a bent position from the heat. So now, it also looks funny. Maybe if they were thicker, I do not know. But I had to buy a different one."
2,Good if you know NOTHING about alliances,"I was hoping that the book would focus on some alliance tips, valuation metrics, and negotiation tactics.None of that.Just an FYI. It's a little too touchy-feely. It's important stuff, no doubt. But for a book with this title, I expected a lot more."
5,Great for cooking ribs in the oven,"I've been looking for the perfect roasting rack for some time now and this is it. It's heavy weight and the entirely covered in a smooth, non-stick coating. The lifting handles are fixed in place but quite generous, allowing room for an oven mitt on your hand. I really like that the ""ribs"" are thick but widely spaced. They still support your food well but fewer ""ribs"" are easier to clean when you're done, although it is dishwasher-safe. Definitely the quality you expect from Calphalon. This rack comes in 2 sizes (this is the larger one) and I bought both. Since the lifting handles are fixed (they don't fold down) be sure to measure the roasting pan you will be using to make sure this will fit. If the size works for you, I think you'll be happy with this reasonably priced, well-designed rack."
1,Not one of the better Titanic books,"I have been a Titanic Historian for over 32 years and found that this book is not even up to par. Most of the book deals with ""Titanic myths"" that the author believes to be fact. He did not do any research apparently or he would have found out from a variety of sources that he was dealing with just myths. There are a veriety of better books out now dealing with Titanic, and her story. This one is just cashing in on the movie fame, without any substantial content. Your money would be better spent on a Walter Lord book."
1,Very sad,"The shirt not only is incredibly thin, which I did expect , but so poorly sewn there are threads all through the interior. I am afraid to clip any because the shirt looks like it will fall apart. Also, the shirt is a dirty red and the strings are orange, very cheap looking. I got it for a show, and hopefuly we wont have to wash it, I think it will disolve.Sigh."
4,just the facts,"A harrowing and strangely dispassionate account of WW1 from a Canadian soldier in the trenches. Apart from reporting what happened, gives insight into how people cope with overwhelming horror."
1,Sorry I ever tried Ezzo material,"Was taught Ezzo material at my church when becoming a first time parent. I felt the book enouraged an almost cult like following as if it were straight from the bible. While the book may say to be flexible, I found most people who taught it's ideas are not."
1,Be Very Afraid,"If you love your baby, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Buy ""The Baby Book"" by William Sears, M.D., and Martha Sears. For a thorough critique of ""Babywise"" books, go to ccli.org, click ""Parenting"" and select ""Growing Families International: a Theological Critique."""
1,What kind of parent do you want to be?,"I read this book at the urging of my parents, who raised me using Ezzo-like methods. Suffice it to say, I was appalled. Please people, understand that your children are not little tyrants whom you must control or be controlled by; they are *people*, forming their own unique identities and finding their own niches in the world. If you want to read a book which will help you form a healthy parenting philosophy, read the Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff. Don't read this one."
1,Feed your hungry baby!,Do you believe your maternal or paternal instincts are God-given or sin-driven? Because this book is all about convincing you to deny your instincts and your infant in order to please God.
1,Dangerous,Even the AAP has issued a statement as to how dangerous this book is. It is linked to failure to thrive. Please do not follow this method. There are other ways to get your baby to sleep.
1,This book is DANGEROUS for your baby,"The feeding program in this book is shown to cause failure to thrive (FTT), poor weight gain, dehydration, breast milk supply failure, and involuntary early weaning. The advice in Babywise is in direct opposition to the latest American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on newborn feeding (AAP Policy Statement, ""Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk,"" Pediatrics, Dec. 1997): ""Newborns should be nursed whenever they show signs of hunger, such as increased alertness or activity, mouthing, or rooting. Crying is a late indicator of hunger. Newborns should be nursed approximately eight to 12 times every 24 hours until satiety."" Demand feeding is best for your baby and endorsed by the AAP and World Health Organization. The Ezzo approach is completely unscientific and downright dangerous!! Stay away!!"
1,"Very, very dangerous book.","Babies whose parents follow the advice of this book have had: failure to thrive, dehydration and slow growth and development, while their mothers end up with involuntary early weaning and poor milk supply. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not like it! Be wise and stay away from Babywise!"
1,"Beware, written like a cult manual.... ever so smooth","Seriously folks, How many of you are actually breastfeeding after 4 months, because this book advocates only feeding an infant 4 times a day at four months. HELLO! Your supply will diminish and your baby will need supplementation much sooner (i.e. before six months) than if you feed on cue. An infant's brain grows 60% its adult size in the first year....frequent breastfeeding bathes it in all the good nutrients it needs. If you want your kid's brain to suffer so that you get good sleep, go right ahead.As a childbirth educator, R.N., and nursing mom, if you read Ezzo, then read Listening to your Baby by Dr. Jay Gordon before you jump on the ""wise"" wagon.Infants have been found with failure to thrive when unsuspecting parents employ this method.All you Christian parents, of which I am one, check out [...] before you fall for a ""Christian"" book.Read the other comments, there is controversy for a reason!!!"
1,Beware . . .,"A friend recommended that I read this book after I had my son. Thankfully, before I implemented any of the advice this book offers, I looked to see what the AAP had to say about scheduled vs. demand feedings (just Google it).Instead of this book, I recommend Baby 411, which IS recommended by my pediatrician (and which has a section discussing Babywise)."
1,BEWARE,"I burned this book in my fireplace and I believe that's where it belongs. It is not healthy for anyone to follow these rules. Period. Just google it ""dangers of baby wise"" and see what information you find. There is a reason pediatricians and psychologists don't recommend this method, it is not healthy.BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Child Abuse manual,"This book is a child abuse manual. I was horrified when I read it. I googled and discovered that this book is responsible for infant being admitted to ER from dehydration and other issues. This book teacher parents to ignore newborn. Infant have no wants, they have needs which are very basic in nature and need to be satisfied."
1,Read With Caution,"This book has many flaws and faults, however one of the biggest is the ""parent directed feeding"". According to the author a parent should place baby on a ridgid feeding schedule and allow the child only to eat at the given times. In many cases this has resulted in failure to thrive.I would suggest visiting the AMA website for more information on infant nutrition and discuss this in depth with at least two different medical professionals, your pediatrician and a pediatric nurse."
1,"This method has been linked to failure to thrive, dehydration, etc.","A book cannot tell you everything your baby needs. Breast feeding on demand is better for your supply and meeting baby's needs. Baby and mom are unique and a specific schedule does not take the physiological or psychological differences into account.Also, this method has been linked to dehydration and failure to thrive.[...]"
1,Manual for Systematic Child Abuse,"This book is appalling. Abuse disguised as parenting. It teaches parents to ""control"" their baby by disregarding their child's attempts at communication (FYI crying is COMMUNICATION, not manipulation) and to starve their children of both food and love by feeding or holding only when convenient for the parent with complete disregard for the baby's needs. Google Babywise and you'll see numerous horror stories of babies being hospitalized for malnutrition because their parents followed this book. Horrific. If there's any book that should be banned it's this one."
1,I love my son too much to do this,"I'm glad I read some of this book instead of relying on the sales figures. After getting a knot in my stomach perusing this book, I decided to learn more about the author.I found that he's a pastor with no medical background, yet he dispenses medical advice. I learned the American Academy of Pediatrics has denounced his practices. I learned his publisher, Multnomah, has cancelled his contract. His system of ""training"" children starting in infancy had been used by many church sponsored parenting classes. Thank goodness that's changing!! Focus on the Family DOES NOT recommend this series of books, and many others are following their lead.Christian parents are realizing one thing -- that God's gifts to them -- i.e., their nurturing instincts, ability to nourish their babies, and good sense -- are gifts to be shared with their children, not weaknesses to be overcome."
1,beware!!!!,"This book is terrible. I read it with an open mind and an open heart, and I was truly horrified. After I read it, I did some research online, and this man is not what he seems. There are some MAJOR character concerns with Gary Ezzo. Do your research before you use these techniques on your precious child."
1,This book is dangerous to the health of babies.,"The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued an alert against the type of parenting recommended in this book. The author is not medically-trained. Pediatricians have observed many children reared in the fashion recommended by the author to have problems such as insufficient weight gain, dehydration, and difficulty thriving.Dr. William Sears' The Baby Book or Nighttime Parenting offers much more healthy sleep and parenting advice for babies and their families. He is a pediatrician, and the father of several children, and offers a balanced view to child rearing."
1,God must be Appalled,"I am an extremely religious Christian Mother and I am sickened by what ""Baby Wise"" teaches. If you would like to read a truly Biblical book on Christian parenting, please try ""The Complete Book of Christian Parenting and Child Care"" by William and Martha Sears. It is based *strongly* in The Bible and is filled with great scriptural references that I have found very helpful and encouraging. ""Christian Parenting and Child Care"" is truly GOD'S WAY, and it is fantastic. My daugher is a blessing to be with, a joy to all who meet her, and I constantly receive compliments on how well behaved, friendly, and charming she is.I would be Afraid and Ashamed to meet my Lord and Savior on Judgement Day had I abused the children he intrusted into my care in the way that BabyWise suggests. I only hope that God Almighty has more mercy and love for Gary Ezzo than Gary Ezzo has for helpless infants [for Ezzo's sake]. Thank God that Christ didn't decide to take the Convenient way out."
1,The Devil's Book,"I received this book when my daughter was 3 weeks old. Thank god I was smart enough to know that it was mostly crazy talk! It wasn't until my daughter was 6-8 weeks old that I started to learn about Attachment Parenting (what Baby Wise warns you against). Now with a 20 month old daughter, I can securely say that this author is a quack! He says that you can go ahead and hold your baby but you will spoil them (I'm not exaggerating people...he writes this!). My daughter is a happy, well connected and independent individual. I didn't sleep train her, and I held her lots and lots. I followed her ques and she now follows mine. She wasn't an easy baby either, so its not like I just won the genetics lottery...she was a tough baby that has been given what she needs....physical and emotional connection to her parents.I've never in my life wanted to have a book burning. On many occasions I've thought about burning this book, I feel so strongly that I don't want anyone else to read it!"
5,BEST EVER!!,"I am a RN and mother of 3 children under the age of 4. These books/concepts are common sense and easy to follow. All of my children were sleeping from 10p-7a at 8-10 weeks of age and from 7p-7a from about 13 weeks. All have different ""personalities"" and yet the concept worked beautifully with each one. There is nothing dangerous or harmful to your child in this books- only sound principles that when applied, will help your child to feel safe and secure in their schedule. They know when they will eat next, nap and go to sleep at night. I am a better parent because I am able to get enough rest to be able to deal with them when they are awake! I do not envy a mother of a 18 mo old child who still wakes up 3-4 times a night for a bottle of milk!Thank you, Babywise!!"
2,NOT for everyone...do your research first!,"While reading this book, the tone comes across that the authors are trying to sell you something--and after reading the entire book, I ultimately, with some struggle, didn't buy the advice. As a new mom, I'm not yet aligned with any one style of parenting (other than what I feel is best for myself, my baby, and my family)--but struggling to apply the advice suggested in this book certainly pushed me in the opposite direction from what they recommend.If you are a proponent of Dr. Sears or La Leche League Int'l., then this book is definitely NOT for you! I think LLLI is a bit extreme at points, but I find most of Dr. Sears advice to be sound, believable, and entirely applicable. That said, I just didn't buy the advice given in this book!"
1,Dangerous for baby,"Following the advice in this is dangerous for your baby. The schedule laid out in this book actually brings your child to the brink of starvation. How is that healthy and responsible? Talk to your pediatrician about it and see what he/she thinks... I highly doubt they would endorse this book. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics says ""Babywise' advice linked to dehydration, failure to thrive.""Please think twice before following the schedule and advice in this book."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a book to help me to get my baby to sleep on his own and to sleep through the night. It's a good and informative book, just not for me."
5,Mommy Felix,"This is a great book for any family who wants to have a reliable and rewarding schedule! I am a first time mom and have enjoyed rest that I was told would no longer be part of my life. My two month old son is a very happy baby and has never cried to the ""point of vomitting"", as one parent noted. If that parent bothered to read the entire book she would know the book does not advocate to starve your child! It is common sense any child will be fussy and cry, sometimes for a long period of time, which is to be expected.This book is explains why the PDF philosophy works better than Demand Feeding. But most importantly it also promotes common sense. I can personally confirm how Demand Fed babies are more likey to become irritable and bratty toddlers because I am related to couple of them. I highly recommend this book and I have already given it as a gift and plan on giving it to any of my expecting friends and family."
1,A dangerous and misleading book,"If you love your child, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! This author's publishing contract has been revoked after numerous reports of malnutrition in babies whose well-meaning parents followed the methods advised in this book. Some babies under two have been seen DEPRESSED as a result of this book. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly warns against employing the practices outlined in Babywise. Mr. Ezzo holds no degrees in child development or pediatric medicine. He advocates physical punishment, leaving babies alone to cry in playpens and cribs for extended periods of time, and strict feeding schedules. If you want a good book about baby care and parenting, buy ""The Baby Book"" by William Sears, M.D., who, by the way, calls ""Babywise"" ""the most dangerous book I've seen in 25 years of pediatric practice."""
5,Great book,We read and followed the guidance of this book and the baby started by sleeping 5 hours straight. She later went to 8 hours straight and now is at 11-12 hours stright through the night. great book.
1,This book gives very legalistic advice,"I read this book and as a new mom was looking for the perfect sleeping solution for my new son. This book initially appealed to my own predisposition for order and routine. However, I had uneasy feelings as I concluded the book. I came to realize that nothing can replace the God-given maternal instinct. Although I agree with a good bit of what Ezzo recommends, I don't believe he is the end-all on child rearing. Dr James Dobson does not recommend their techniques. I recommend to perhaps read the book but don't let Ezzo's advice be the last word. My child (now two) didn't sleep through the night until he was 7 months but now is an excellent napper and night-sleeper. Ezzo scares me a bit with his rigidity."
1,A pamphlet disguised as a book,"This is the worst book I have ever read, it should have been published as a pamphlet. Appears to have been written for Alzheimer patients because of how often it repeats itself. Content was good and has worked very well for our twins, but this book is way to repetitive."
1,Just awful,"Researched this book while pregnant and was horrified. We decided to do everything &quot;wrong&quot; (eat, sleep and play on demand), and our baby slept through the night at five weeks. She's happy, well adjusted and a delight both at home and in public.Please look into Dr. Sears' book before even considering this one."
1,Depression,"This is an absolute waste of time. If you are looking to have a clinical case of depression, this will give it to you."
3,"GREAT IN THEORY, BUT NOT IN PRACTICE","WHILE I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT IN THEORY WHILE I READ IT DURING MY PREGNANCY, PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE WAS ANOTHER STORY AFTER WE HAD OUR BABY. TRYING TO STICK TO THE SCHEDULE DROVE ME CRAZY. WHILE I AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF DR. EZZO'S PHILOSOPHY, IT'S A VERY RIGID REGIMEN. INSTEAD I WOULD RECOMMEND ""SOLVING YOUR CHILD'S SLEEP PROBLEMS"" BY DR. FERBER AS WELL AS ""HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS, HAPPY CHILD"" BY DR. WEISSBLUTH. BOTH ARE VERY SCIENTIFIC AS WELL AS INSIGHTFUL. DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR CHILD WAS COLICKY, SHE STARTED SLEEPING 7 - 8 HOURS AT ONE MONTH...EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP FOR THE NIGHT UNTIL 4:00 AM!! ONCE THE COLIC PASSED AT THREE MONTHS, SHE WOULD GO TO BED AT 9:00 PM AND SLEEP 11 - 12 HOURS AND I CERTAINLY DON'T ATTRIBUTE IT TO ""ON BECOMING BABYWISE""."
1,Dangerous and Abusive,"If followed as prescribed, this method is supportive of abuse and neglect to children. My children have always slept through the night and have perfect sleep habits now that they are older, and I never felt the need to use the tactics put out in this method. Ezzo doesn't back his method by medical research of any weight and has hundreds of medical professionals giving solid research against his method. Obviously any parent with common sense can sift through the obviously dangerous advice given, but he makes statements constantly making it sound as though your child will become a criminal if his layout is not strictly followed. I would highly suggest not buying this book."
3,"A ""one size fits all"" fixer","I purchased this book because of several good reviews by my mother's friends. After reading it, I'm not sure I agree. The methods used are meant to be implemented from the first week of life. Seeing as I purchased this book when my daughter was 4 months old, they are a little harder to put to use now. I'm not crazy about the parenting philosophy used in the book. It is against attachment parenting and insists that any child will have no problem adhering to your schedule and your every demand. SO not true! My daughter is a high needs baby and these techniques just aren't suited for her personality. Overall, the book fails to take into account that not every child will be so easy going and adapt to such a schedule."
1,You don't need this book.,"I heard great things about this book and thought I needed it to get my baby to sleep well. Not true. I did buy the book but didn't even read it completely. My (formula fed) baby ate every 3-4 hours and slept completely through the night at 8 weeks. Even after 3 weeks he only got up to eat and then went right back to sleep. I think as long as you establish a routine, you will be fine and do not need any books."
1,No much to add...,"to the other reviews that say this book is horrible, other than that this is the only baby book that ever made me cry. I feel so sad for the poor children that are going to be subjected to this callous treatment. I wish I could come personally and hold them all while they cry. If you must read this, please read The Baby Book by Sears as well to get a more well-rounded perspective."
1,know who the author is,"Babywise is the secular book, based on the same principles of Ezzo Growing Family International ""christian"" parenting ministry. In these books, Ezzo makes statements such as: ""A child is not born morally good but with a natural predisposition for moral waywardness."" (Growing Kid's God's Way, p.18)Ezzo takes sound parenting practice such as following a routine wiht your baby, and dangerously takes it up a notch....with rigid feeding and sleep schedules....allowing for little deviation.Crying is not a baby misbehavior! It is their only way to communicate! New parents be wary1"
1,Ferberizing all over again...,"This book was recommended to me by my cousin, so I bought it in good faith. It was all I could do to finish the book, and I can tell you that it did not work for me. If you don't mind training your child not to trust their own instincts, treating them like a lab rat, and causing them to feel from a very early age (day one) that their needs don't deserve to be met unless it's convenient for you as their supposed caregiver, then this is the book for you. Personally, I like a more positive and emotionally bonding method. If you do too, check out any of these books by Dr. William Sears: The Attachment Parenting Book, The Baby Book, The No-Cry Sleep Solution, or The Complete Book of Christian Parenting & Child Care. There are better alternatives to the ""cry-it-out"" method that still allow parents to get a good night's sleep! Trust me. I'm one of those parents who found a better way."
1,Most horrible baby book on the market,"This book has been linked with Failure to Thrive, dehydration, and an almost guaranteed loss of breastmilk supply. There are only TWO medical references and they are dated in 1982 and 1986 - totally outdated. It suggests letting a baby starve in order to get him on a schedule. The advice in this book is in direct opposition with the AAP's recommendations for feeding schedules. A newborn needs to eat, on demand, in order to survive and grow well. Anything else is abusive. How would you feel if you were starving, trying to grow, and no one would feed you? You were losing weight because no one would feed you? You weren't thriving because no one would feed you? This book is ridiculous and insinuates that abuse is the way to raise a child."
1,Hardly Baby Wise,"Would you want to be limited to a strict eating schedule, or be denied the comfort of a cuddle or kiss when you are scared or feel abandoned? Then why would you expect a baby to be treated that way? Nothing short of cruel, Ezzo's Method is also dangerous. Babies have died from unknowing parents using his ""feeding schedule"" without following their baby's cues. Even if you don't follow the attachement parenting ideology, stay away from this man's purported answer to the ""selfish"" needs of the baby. There is nothing selfish about wanting to eat, be in a dry diaper, or wanting to cuddle when you are scared or lonely."
1,"If you can ignore your baby's needs, this book's for you","I got this book as a shower gift and only got through the 1st few chapters before throwing it away in frustration and disgust. I could never let my baby cry due to hunger and not feed her. My pediatrician says that babies need to eat more often then every 4 hours during the first few months to grow properly. It seems this advice is not only controversial and highly opinionated, but dangerous.The advice on co-sleeping really annoyed me, too. In most countries co-sleepings is commonplace and we don't hear about babies dying. Many parents have slept with their babies without incident and the advice this book gives is simply silly. There are many benefits to co-sleeping such as convenience if you're breastfeeding and increased bonding with your child. Don't waste your money on this book..."
1,Bad Book,"I read about 100 pages of this book and was very annoyed. I found him too simplistic with a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to babies. I also questioned the accuracy of some of his statements. I was left with the feeling that his approach was simply ""not right."" I then went on-line and found a plethora of criticism about the author....no wonder! Don't waste your time with this book, or at least familiarize yourself with the criticism that surrounds this very controversial book.Buy instead the ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" and ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" which are much better books and more compassionate for your baby's needs."
5,"This book works - from ""real parents""","This book is great. It was recommended to me by my cousin who was having sleeping problems with her baby. This was an incredible help to her as it was to my wife and I with our baby daughter. Our daughter sleeps 11 hours a night uninterrupted and has been doing so since 4 months - thanks to the methods taught in this book. I couldn't help but write a review after reading yesterday's too lengthy and unflattering review by an ""educator/parent"". Quite simply, I do not agree with anything she has to say. It sounds like there's some sour grapes there - but do not be discouraged. This book works, it makes a lot of sense and it preaches love for you child. I, as part of a two working parent household, have nothing but praises to sing for this book and feel lucky that it was recommended to me."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK....CHILD WILL SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT,"I love this book and recommend it to all new moms. Don't let some of the comments here keep you from buying it. If they read the book correctly, they would know that there is a balance in the schedule....a middle ground between Child driven feeding and a mandatory schedule feeding. The best advice I learned was to wake up my baby and feed her at 10 pm...their little tummies weren't made to sleep from 9pm to 8 am. She has slept through the night since 9 weeks. Only when she is teething, does she wake up. She is 16 months old now. I'm buying the third book now...Even if you don't agree with everything he writes, there are still some great tools here that make it worth buying."
1,I do not recommend this book!,"Out of all the bad advice I received as a new mother, following this book was the worst! Fortunately, I had the sense to stop following this book and start listening to my own instincts when my son was about 2 1/2 months old.I recommend reading ""The Baby Book"" by Dr Sears, who was unjustly criticized by the authors of this book.(And by the way, my son sleeps through the night just fine, without following the methods in this book!)"
1,a disaster,"readers should know that not only is this book a disastrous discussion on child rearing, it is also a very controversial book...don't bother reading this book. you don't have to reach the page where the authors tell you that --if your 2 year old wets or soils his underpants and the floor that he should be spanked, and then told to clean up his mess and himself after-- to know that the authors are severe and even somewhat bizarre. there are better, well-written, thoughtful and humane books by educated and qualified authors to choose from..."
4,BABY WISE,Recommended by a few friends as a must read for first time parents. Advice sounds good and logical.... we'll have to see for the results.
1,this book is trash,I cannot believe anyone with a brain would recommend this book which verges on abuse. If I could give it less than one star I would!
4,Be A Balanced Parent,"I will be the first to admit that there is no such thing as a perfect book instructing us on how to be parents. Baby Wise is not the perfect book, however, it does contain valuable information that can assist you in making an educated decision in stressful times with your child. We taught our son a schedule using the methods in this book and they worked. There is a balance and only you know your child. Many of the negative remarks stated are by parents that have no self-discipline in themselves or they are not teachable adults. Either way, it is a pre-requisite to being a parent: ""In order to teach, you must be taught."""
1,You try the schedule and see how it suits you,"This book touts a kind of militaristic regimen more fit for inmates than infants. When was the last time you limited yourself to eating and drinking only every 3 hours? Come on! You drink when you're thirsty and eat when you're hungry, and we're adults, we can go longer without food and water. These are helpless INFANTS, they need all the nourishment they get, they are not ""selfishly crying"" they cry because they are IN NEED OF CARE. If you did what this book recommends to your dog, it'd be cruelty to animals, but somehow this pastor's comments are valid for babies? Listen to the healthcare professionals and take good care of your baby."
3,old version,"I wish there was a way to know what version I was getting before it arrives. I bought the book used, which I prefer but may have to give up. There is a more current version of the book published and the changes are significant enough that I threw out the old book and am reading the newer one that I borrowed from a friend."
1,Train your baby? Who are you kidding?,"When I first bought this book I was desperate for help with getting my daughter to sleep. But after reading it and then reading up on Ezzo, I threw away the book.Sure, with his way you might be able to get your child to sleep....but that child would never know the comfort of your loving arms. You signed on to be a parent, so stick it out and do what's right for your child. Don't try and fit your child into your life...you'll end up scarring him/her in ways you can't imagine. (There have been cases of babies dying with Ezzo's methods, by the way.) Do some reading ABOUT Ezzo before you actually read his book."
1,Do your research first!!!,I found the book to be very manipulative and contradictory. It touts research and studies that are never substantiated. I knew that following this book would be in opposition to my instincts as a mother. I started to do research about the author and found a wealth of information that discredits this book. So many people I know follow this book as though it is a manual for child rearing without questioning it or doing their research. Look into Gary Ezzo and the controversy surrounding this book before adhering to its principles.
4,EXCELLENT METHODS,"I wish I'd known about this book with my first child. It has proven to be such a help. All four of my children adapted well to this method, as did my nephew. It truly works, and it helps smooth the transition from pregnancy to parenthood. I found it very soothing for my children, who are quite diverse in personality!! I recommend the second book as well, however, the others following it are not worth the time. If you are a person unable to stick with routine, do not read any of these books. They will frustrate you, but if you see your child in need of some regularity, this will help tremendously. IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP ALL NIGHT SOON AFTER YOUR CHILD IS BORN, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!! Please note that he does not really discuss medical conditions that would prevent these methods from working in this book such as asthma, etc. Avoid this reading if this is your situation."
3,Easy learning,"I used to listen to this every time I was in the car. I found it to be very helpful. I have used much of the advice, but not all. I think with all things, you must trust yourself."
5,Grateful for this book!!!!,"The moment my husband and I found out we were going to have a baby we immediately started to prepare ourselves. We signed up for educational classes at the hospital, read books, spoke to relatives, etc. We thought we were totally prepared. Things changed the moment we brought our daughter home. It took 2 days for her to completely get her nights and days mixed up! This continued for a month and our efforts to correct the problem failed. My mother-in-law purchased the book for us after a co-worker told her about it. I thank her every day! My daughter is 5 months old and she is such a pleasure to be around. Everytime we take her out people always comment on what a happy child she is. She slept through the night at 2 month's and we haven't had any problems since. If you find yourself rocking your child endlessly to get them to fall asleep then, tiptoeing them to their crib praying you don't wake them, get this book. It is truly a miracle!"
1,Please spare your baby the harm of Baby Wise!,"Baby Wise teaches you to put your baby on a schedule for sleep and feedings and to always put the parents first. I agree that parents need to take care of themselves, but also the need for a healthy bond between baby and mom is especially important. Follow your instincts, new moms, and hold your baby. Love them and feed them when they're hungry, snuggle them to sleep, they won't be little for very long and you'll definitely regret it if you miss out for even a moment."
5,Dangerous? No way,"I just read a review that said the book's author wasn't a doctor (half-true), that the book's approach was ""harsh"" and ""rigid"" (untrue) and dangerous for your baby (untrue). We were introduced to the book before the first of our 3 kids and have found it wonderfully helpful. The book's co-author is a medical doctor and all of the advice is medically sound. The approach gives a balance of structure that's helpful for children with the flexibility we parents need with our busy lives. The parent-directed feeding is the best way to ensure that breast-feeding babies get the richest, most nutritious milk. All of our kids have been healthy and happy and we have gotten enough sleep to be good parents during our waking hours."
1,disturbing,"As a mother of six with over 20 years of parenting experience,I am deeply disturbed by what I read in this book. It is filled with overgeneralizations, exaggerations and falsehoods. The breastfeeding information in contrary to current lactation knowledge. The psychology information is inaccurate. It may ""work"" for some babies, but is it best for baby? Keep in mind that the authors call it an ""infant management program"", which is exactly what it is. You won't find much value as far and love and bonding and relating to your baby in this book."
1,Not recommended by this health professional,"As a registered nurse, Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator, Lactation Counselor and mom, a cannot recommend this book. The methods in this book have been found to be dangerous to some children's health. Even to the extent that many children have presented to the ER dehydrated or malnurished. If you are breastfeeding, the techniques will it significantly decrease your chances of maintaining a plentiful milk supply at a minimum. If sleep deprivation is the issue, buy ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" instead and you'll feel good about your choice, not to mention sleep a lot more!"
1,Dangerous Advice,"Gary Ezzo has been excommunicated from his own church and is not ordained. The American Academy of Pediatrics has spoken out against BabyWise methods as leading to the dehydration, FTT, and death of infants. It is the only method/book they have ever issued a warning against. What Ezzo teaches goes against all our natural, God-given maternal instincts. Please do some research on Ezzo and BabyWise before taking his advice."
5,Loved it.,"We loved Babywise. As the book says, you do need to be a little bit flexible, and you do feed your child if they're showing signs of hunger- if it turns out they only wanted a snack and didn't take a full feeding, you keep that in mind for the next day. The first two months are hard (waking the baby up in the night for a feeding), but it's totally worth it. Our son is now 2 and a half, and I can count on 2 hands the times he hasn't slept through the night since he was 8 weeks old. He also had no problem transitioning to a big boy bed. The times he did wake up it was because he was teething, sick, or had a nightmare.If you're going to try it, give it a good 2 1/2 month try unless your pediatrician tells you otherwise. It's totally worth it. Our peditarician said that he used it with his kids and that it's fine, just use your head. If it doesn't work for you, don't worry about it. It doesn't make you a bad parent either way. God's blessings on your new family!"
1,A horrible book,"This book advocates suffering in a NEWBORN BABIES life. If there was a way to rate it negative stars, I would! As a mother of three small children, I can't imagine leaving a child to cry for up to 20 or 30 minutes. That is child abuse and neglect. A baby cries because that is the only way it has of communicating. Yes, the eventually stop crying because they have GIVEN up on you coming to be with them."
3,"It may work for you now, later or not at all.","I was given a copy of Babywise before my daughter was born and it seemed like a practical approach. However, when she actually arrived, she was hungry more than every three hours (and yes, the milk supply was fine) and an extremely light sleeper. Had we let her cry herself back to sleep each time she awakened, we would have been completely exhausted listening to her. What this book doesn't mention is that babies go through phases--what doesn't work in the first few weeks may easily work later. When she was about nine weeks old, she suddenly put herself on the three hour feed/wake/sleep schedule the book recommends. I am convinced that she just needed to mature. She doesn't sleep through the night yet, but even this book cannot offer guarantees. Sleeping through the night isn't a standard by which parenting is judged--it's simply a product of a child's readiness to do so."
1,Both Biblically and scientifically invalid,"This book advocates breastfeeding strategies that will work for some women, but will produce dehydrated or failure-to-thrive babies for others. Not every mother produces enough milk to go 3 hours between feedings and still satisfy the newborn's need for nutrition. Babywise can be dangerous to the health of your newborn."
5,THE BEST PREPARATION FOR A NEW PARENT!,"I give this book to all my friends who are expecting their first child. I read this book before the birth of my first child, and I credit it for making me a confident new parent. When I brought my daughter home from the hospital I really felt like I knew what I was doing. My children are now 3 1/2 and 18 months and they have always been extremely healthy, happy, and fantastic sleepers. They began sleeping through the night regularly at 6 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively, and to this day go to bed and take naps like angels.My friends who didn't follow the Baby Wise principals eventually resorted to letting their babies cry during the night after they had not gotten a good night sleep in a year!I have received numerous comments about how ""lucky"" I am to have babies who are such good sleepers. It was not luck. It was Baby Wise."
1,Baby Horrified!,"As a first time parent, I purchase every parenting book I can hoping to glean a little something from them all. When a friend recommended Baby Wise, I eagerly cracked the book and prepared to soak up the knowledge. By the end of Chapter Three I was horrified at the reccomendations made by the authors. The book argues that all babies are alike, capable of the same patterns if parented properly (by holding them less, programming them to eat every three hours, and making baby understand that she is not the most important thing in the family during infancy!). The content smacks of corporal punishment of infants. I researched the author and discovered that Gary Ezzo has spent most of his life as an Evangelical Christian Minister and is now Executive Director of Growing Families International- Google It and Ezzo before you buy Baby Wise- Had I done so I would not have purchased this product."
1,PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION,"Most medical professionals will tell you that the feeding methods described by Ezzo can be harmful to an infants physical and emotional health. Carried to an extreme, these methods can and have led to death. If you decide to use these techniques anyway, please be extremely careful. Be honest with your pediatrician about your feeding schedule (don't lie b/c you think he/she won't like it), and if your baby isn't gaining weight, looks dehydrated, is extremely fussy or shows any other signs of illness, get your baby to the ER and choose another method. Realize that there are other ways of raising kids God's way."
4,"Great guidelines, but use your own judgement","Don't let the controversy about this book stop you from reading it. You can put your baby on a schedule, and still smother him with love at the same time. I followed most guidelines in this book, but I would never allow my baby to ""cry it out"" as the author suggests. I would always let him know that I was there when he cried by stroking his head or singing to him, but I would walk away once he stopped crying (before he fell asleep). He was sleeping through the night at 12 weeks of age. Bottom line: A FLEXIBLE schedule works, just use your best judgement."
5,A God Sent,I give this book to everyone of my friends having a baby. I have mommy's tell me this was one of the best gifts they received. It's a book that gives suggestions on how to help your baby sleep through the night.
3,Second child don't make same mistakes you made with the first one.,"Not sure that my kids really read it, but it was a second child and theyhad said that they didn't want to make the same mistakes with the secondas they did with the first one."
2,Maybe a good concept if you can understand it,If reading (and having to re-read) a textbook is what you are looking for then you've found the perfect book. I can barely understand what they are trying to tell me.
4,"Wise alternative to postmodern ""attachment parenting""","We're not wholehearted endorsers of the entire Ezzo program, but ""Babywise"" has worked very well in raising our two (now three) children. The best thing about it: love for our kids does not mean smothering attention and instant gratification of every whimper with the breast or shoulder. The practical benefits (besides babies who quickly sleep through the night) have included children who are comfortable in their own spaces, are secure and happy with strangers and other family members (even if mom and dad are out of the room), learn the importance of structure and routine, and who develop a relation with their parents based on trust, not proximity. This book also stands out for pointing out that ""attachment parenting"" is neither ancient nor biblical nor ""natural"", but based on Spock and modern psychobabble. Properly applied, these principles are valuable for any parent."
1,Glad this is finally out of print,"As a health care provider, I do not endorse this book. Those who follow the practices outlined in this book bring babies into my office who are clinically malnourished and actually showing signs of Failure to Thrive. Instead of this book, I would recommend _The Family Bed_ or _Natural Family Living_. If you would like to read books from a Christian perspective, I recommend books by Dr. Sears.I've done a lot of reading on infant sleep and discipline, and never before have I read a book that I wish was banned. Thank goodness the publishers have heeded the call of health professionals and canceled their contract with Mr. Ezzo."
1,Worst Parenting Book Ever!,If you actually love your child more than you love yourself you won't follow this book! Do some real research on Gary Ezzo...
1,Why did you become a parent anyway?,"I can't believe this book. It's so sad to me that people would read this book and think it's a good way to interact with your baby, the most precious and vulnerable thing in the world. Hopefully people have children to love them and be part of their family. Having your child sleep through the night by eight weeks shouldn't be your primary objective. Raising a healthy, well adjusted and happy baby should be your objective. It just shows how out of whack our society is. And people wonder why we have so many social problems. It's because we value sleep and convienience over the well-being of our children. We value time in front of the TV over time with our babies. It is truly sad. If you're looking for compassionate, yet balanced views on parenting and babies, look into some books by Dr. Sears. Other good books are ""Attachment Parenting"" ""Vital Touch"" and ""Our Babies Ourselves"". That's where you will truly find the answer."
1,Skewed views - Not for Christians,"30 min to an Hour of crying... wake up and smell the coffee!! Your child isn't self-soothing, she's passing out from exhaustion! And yes, I do think it abusive to allow that to go on! Gary Ezzo was banned from his church from the conflict that arose from his writings. The only exp. he draws from is his own children. He has absolutely no medical, or psychological background. He's created an occult following with ""Growing Kids Gods Way"" that is so loosely based on biblical principles that it is almost laughable except that it IS dangerous for infant children. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, has also made a public statement against Gary Ezzo and his writings. Do more research before you laud something so destructive! Some of the reveiwers have given much better suggestions for guides to parenting infants. Any of them would be better than this!"
3,Still confused after reading...,"I've read this over and over and though my little guy is on a great three hour feeding schedule, at six weeks old I'm having trouble getting him to nap throughout the day like the book says. He's finally sleeping five hrs through the night, but after he wakes in the morning he's up for a few hours, then only has about 2 two to three hour naps the entire day (I hope he's getting enough sleep!). Waking a baby after he eats is another thing...he wants to sleep after he eats!! I try and try to wake him and it's a hit or miss. So the feedings I agree with and I'll come back and comment at 8 wks when he should ""supposedly"" be sleeping through the night...that would be nice..."
2,Buy a bridal mag instead,There are limited ideas and since trends change from season to season you are better off buying a bridal magazine. If you are looking for help planning a wedding there are better sources online. Watching cable television can give you ideas and save you some money; money that you can actually use for the wedding reception.
2,Mediocre at best...,"Not worth the money. The book is split into 4 seasonal weddings: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. Each has a distinct theme and carries it through, which means you are only presented with four options to look through for wedding ideas. A lot of the ideas are also focused around food, so depending on whether you are hiring a caterer or not, that may not apply. Plus, over 100 pages (236-351 specifically) are footnotes, credits, and a list of vendors so there aren't any pictures or ideas from that point on. ...."
1,Waste of Money!!,There are better books out there. This is a big waste of money. The book was not what I was expecting.
4,Zolof... A Review,"A totally fresh, up beat, pop punk band that presents charming vocals and catchy lyrics. Sounds similar to Weezer and most things Drive Thru, only chick fronted and better. TeeHee. I would recomend this album to anyone with ears or a brain because it requires only one or the other to love Zolof!"
2,Great Music But...,"This was my first experience with this group. I enjoy world music and thought this cd would be a good buy. Although the music was what I was looking for, the lyrics were what threw me off. I was expecting to hear authentic language to accompany the music, but some of the songs included translation in English which kind of spoiled the whole effect for me. Even though I am not multilingual, I like to let the music and vocals create an atmosphere where my imagination or mood deciphers the lyrics. Translations would be better included in the cd jacket, not in the songs."
4,A Great Live Band,"Steeleye Span is & has been a great live band but you couln't quite tell so by their live recordings. Gone To Australia is another good but flawed live album. Like Tonight's The Night, Live at Last & the Journey there is great material but the emphasis seems to be on slower songs. This CD is worth having, but probably not as an introduction. To personally solve the problem I just made a compillation disk of the live material & got one great car CD."
2,"""Saving Face""","I am pretty sure I got a fake. I'm not saying someone else will get the same if they order this but i'm thinking I did. I have used other face lotions before and they did just fine. I tried this 3 times in a 20 minute bed and everytime it burns my face. I make sure the yellow facial button is off and that I have it rubbed in well. I am not new to indoor tanning, I usually go a couple times a week. I might as well of rubbed vegetable oil on my face."
3,Burnt my face :(,"I use a tanning bed with a special ""no-burn"" face lamp which emits less burning rays and is supposed to be lighter on your face and neck. Before buying this product, I just used regular indoor tanning lotion on my face and neck (underneath would be my face moisturizer with sunscreen in it, so I don't know what good I was even doing)... I had no problems... I used this product one time and I burnt my neck and face pretty bad... I haven't had the courage to use it again and I probably won't. :("
3,TNA Bound For Glory 2007 review,"The best matches on the card were The Christian Cage-Samoa Joe match which was a pretty good,hard-hitting,solid bout and the TNA World title match between Sting & Kurt Angle which was not great but good and could have done better without Kevin Nash & the lame ending. The worst matches were The Fight for the Right Reverse Battle Royal which was nothing more then a mindless filler and the 10 women Gauntlet For The Gold to be the first TNA Knockouts champion which while not a bad match,I still think they could have done better. The Rest were ok. I give this event a 6 out of 10."
3,My daughter would love this,"toy if you would make the parts bigger...Yes I know this is geared for older children. I however have a daughter who is will be 4 next April...She wants toys like this but has a sister who won't be 2 even until next February...My daughter cannot and does not get toys like this because for one she is irresponsible about picking up toys like this and for two because her younger sister loves all this barbie and swan lake stuff as well too...It would be extrememly nice if the manufacturer of mattel and barbie products would start making toys similar to the swan lake and barbie, etc, etc...for toddlers and preschoolers to be able to enjoy as well...I don't need any choking happening so I refuse to purchase this toy, let alone hearing the arguments and tantrums that will come of it...For me and parents like myself this would cause only headache is unfair to the younger who are also fans of barbie and barbie accessories as well....."
4,One of the best from the Living Legends crew,"This CD overall is pretty tight except for the fact that MURS is nowhere to be found on it. Sunspot Jonz did a great job with the production of this CD. The CD has a real underground vibe to it, which is the reason I am giving this CD 4 stars. If your a Legends fan this CD should be in your collection. The cover is a bit strange, can anyone explain to me why the cover is the way it is? If you are new to the Living Legends then pick up this CD or any of the other Mystik Journeymen albums, those are all pretty good."
2,Overpackaged,"This product (and others in the line) are the most overpackaged items I've ever bought. It's not a miracle cream, but it's better than average. I would consider buying it again if it weren't so wasteful. For .5 oz you buy an enormous dispenser and unnecessary packaging."
4,Chemical Love,"The romantically inclined might not be comfortable with having love explaíned away as advanced chemistry. A chemistry that is controlled by our genes and seldom overruled by our higher brain functions.Yet, understanding chemistry and genes might actually help us understand love better. Certainly, noone should be without the information in this book!It comes highly recommended.-Simon"
3,A rather flimsy cutter,"This baking spatula/cutter will not scratch your non-stick cookware or bakeware. For that reason alone, it is worth buying. I have used it many times to remove baked goods from ""non-stick"" bakeware, which always seems to stick anyways. However, this spatula/cutter does have some issues. It is very long, and rather flimsy. To cut effectively, I have found I must hold the handle very close to the cutting edge in order to keep the cutter from bending. It is somewhat clumsy to use, but better than scratching your bakeware with metal! It is not very useful for cutting anything hard, (several day old brownies for example), because it is simply too flimsy."
1,PROGRAM DID NOT WORK,THE PROGRAM DID NOT WORK FOR ME. IT WONT TRANSFER DVD MOVIES FROM NETFLIX BECAUSE THEY ARE ENCRYPTED SO YOU NEED ANOTHER PROGRAM TO DO SO.IT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA. I TRIED TO TRANSFER A BOXING EVENT THAT I RECORDED ON A DVD AND IT ONLY SHOWS THE TITLE AND THE OPTION TO TRANSFER TO PSP WAS NOT AVAILABLE BY CLIKING ON THE SAME.IT DID NOT WORK ON MY OTHER COMPUTER THAT HAS WINDOWS XP.
2,Disappointed,"Was so disappointed when I opened the box from Amazon today! I actually ordered these in 3 different colors, thinking they were actual blank book-type notebooks that I could include with gifts. Thought they were special-priced on clearance. NOT SO. The price of $1.50 is actually printed on the back, and they are really small and kind of chintzy looking. Definitely not what I thought I was getting. Should definitely be listed as notepads, not notebooks."
3,Cute but not up to expectations,"This book is cute, but the price was supposed to be a ""sale"" and it is the price listed on the back. It's a very small book, not much use for actual journaling. But OK for a very small gift."
5,Very cute!,"These are adorable little notebooks. I would have loved to have one when I was a girl/teen. They are not full size, very good size for your purse."
2,Small Notebook,"THis is cute, but a little bit smaller than I expected. Should be fine for a gift for the grandkids"
5,The young Maderna,This concerto for 2 pianos and percussions is an unexpected masterpiece of the early compositions of the great italian composer Bruno Maderna.Andrea Molino and the Ex Novo Ensemble seem to be at their best.A MUST for any person who understands the music of the XXth Century.
1,Not worth the money,"We purchased a full set of Caphalon pans approx.3 years ago. We have had to return them several times. The pans are fine except food sticks, cannot put frozen items in them, cannot use PAM, cannot preheat and cannot use on highheat. Recently replaced them with a [different set] which is far superior in ease of use, clean up etc. The only redeeming feature of the is that they are heavy."
5,A thinking-person's book about dolphins,"As a graduate student in Hawaii, I was fortunate enough to have encounters with dolphins on several snorkle outings. It is certainly a special experience, but stop reading here if you think I am about to launch into a new-age rant about ""...how dolphins are helping humans to evolve""!Norris presents an accessible description about dolphin behavior and the science involved in that study. Although I have a science background, I know little biology, and yet Norris clearly presents this work in terms I could understand, and that any thinking person will be comfortable with. I have since purchased other books by Norris on dolphins, and schedule snorkle trips everytime I visit the Islands. If you have seen the latest IMAX movie ""Dolphins"" (dedicated to Norris), now is the time to read the book!"
4,Very Informative,The book was very informative about the art of irish quilt making. Each step was very well documented. However i would have liked to see color pictures.
3,"Coral Springs, FL",The product arrived on time. I had ordered Fuji tapes and they sent TDK. I was not happy that they sent a substitute. TDK audio tapes are good but these videos are not as good the fuji tapes. The recordings comes out more grains on the video and less sharpness to it. I wish that they had notified me first before they make the decision for the customer. Do not like their process. I will not recommend this marketplace. Disappointed in the product and service.
1,ineffective,"I decided on this product because of some of the reviews I read. What a mistake. This is too flimsy to handle whisking. I have ruined several sauces because of its flimsyness (ex: carmel, hollandaise). It just barely came through an a light butter sauce. It really doesn't hold up to much of anything. Forget it for a roux. Its only effective funtions can be better done by other utensils. I am going to have get another different wisk. VERY VERY disappointed."
5,"Goooooolden sun, and siiiiiiiilver mooooooooooooon...","^_^ This is my absolutely, no doubt, most favourite Pokémon intro - English or Japanese!! I can't get over the mess they made of it when they made ""Whole New World"" for the English eps...couldn't they have left it? ;_; Anyway, so OK! is brill...great...spiffing in fact O_O. ""Type:WILD is coolies...English too...and the rest of the songs are good, but OK has to be the best Pokémon song so buy it now. Why are you reading this? BUY BUY BUY! (O':'O) Buy for moi..?"
5,My Mother's Recipes!,"Finally, Norwegian recipes just like my mother's. Perhaps it's because the author is from Oslo and so is my mom but I was so thrilled to see the food we grew up with in this book. This weekend I made the yellow pea soup and, of all the recipes I found online, this was the only one calling for whole yellow peas, which is what we used in my house. We always had Lompa, not lefse. This book has lefse recipes AND a lompa recipe. Another, Sandkake. Everybody wants to grind almonds into the batter but not in my house nor in this book.We lost our dear mother a few months ago and now more than ever I regret not learning more from her and this book is the next best thing. Thank you!"
5,Good old fashioned Norwegian cooking,This book contains many of the traditional recipres my grandmother made when I was young. When she died her cookbook disappeared-this is a very suitable replacement. I highly recommend this book looking to rediscover their Norwegian roots.
5,woefully underrated,"Great CD. I was only familiar with Barbara's hit's, ""Hello Stranger"" being my favorite. So I was pleasantly surprised to find several more songs with that sound, namely ""How Can I Say Goodbye"" and ""Spend A Little Time"". Just sublime vocals with a haunting, heartbroken undercurrent, and that trademark organ."
4,Brother's fav,"My brother seems to like this series, I don't really get it but it does have an interesting story. Not sure what's going on in it though."
2,Uncomfortable.,They really do make your ears sore after an hour of more. Plus you can't lie down with them on. I don't have any comment on the sound quality.
3,Product not what I ordered,"The item shipped was not the item ordered. Given the hassle of returning it, we decided to make it work. Sub-par at best in my opinion but ny daughter thinks it's okay for what she does."
2,Very boring movie,What is all the fuss here? There must be something else to this movie because my wife and I were very much wondering what the plot was about for the first hour and the second hour seemed like a glorification of stubbornness to the point of stupidity.
5,"""A man's got to go his own way.""","""Cool Hand Luke"" is about a man who will not give up his values for anything. There's a scene where one of the inmates is shaking his head and saying, ""I don't have any chains"" while Newman is saddled with chains for trying to escape. But really he does have chains and Newman is the one who is free- because he's free in the mind (he hasn't given up his values).Everybody in the movie tries to break him and he never gives up.This is my favorite movie."
2,Vented pockets pretty small,Unless you have xs sized waders and size 6 childrens feet the vented end pockets are far too small to accomodate your wet gear and facilitate drying them.Construction looks pretty good on it however.
4,SSJ Trunks rocks!,"This is a great model. The pieces fit together very well. Sometimes I have trouble turning the middle thigh joints. I give it 3 to 5 stars for fun because it's more fun with other action figures/models. Model kits teach patience and appreciation for your own work, but not much else. This kit is much more durable than a Gundam. My kit's shoes stay on unless I take them off on purpose. The hands are hard to get on to their joints. DON'T LET THE BOX FOOL YOU: the hair is one piece, not two! The pieces of my model are royal blue, not navy. Overall, I give SSJ Trunks 85 out of 100."
5,Good stuff!,Have been looking for this DVD all over and was glad to find it with this vendor. DVD arrived within designated time and was in described condition. Pleased with purchase. Would purchase from vendor again.
3,A passable look back at 70's-era Disney action/adventure,"Watchable, generally entertaining movies marred by some truly sub-par special effects (especially the completely unconvincing flying Winnebago in the first film and the helicopter flying upside down in the second film) and an overall lack of true menace. Getting both films for the price of one DVD is a big plus, permitting me in good conscience to give this offering a modest recommendation. It also helps that a few big names lend their acting talents to these films, including Eddie Albert, Christopher Lee, and Bette Davis, giving a little something extra for adults to watch (though all these actors have certainly done better work before and after these movies). Nice, sharp prints of the films are used for this DVD, but there aren't any notable extras to speak of."
3,great movie/poor sound quality,"My family loves the movies. What a great opportunity to be able to purchases something I remember watching as a child, and to find out my kids love it as well. My only problem is the sound quality of the DVD is very poor. It had to be turned all the way up on the TV, and yet it sounded as if an old reel tape movie was running in the background almost drowning out the talking in the movie itself. I know its not our system because its all brand new flat screen and brand new DVD player. Perhaps they should check the quality before shipping it out."
2,Not as helpful as I'd hoped,"I have trouble with the wire slipping out, especially when I'm trying to twist two wires together. It's also awkward to hold with one hand and twist with the other. Twisting the wire would probably be easier if I had 3 hands."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Logistics of rodent defense and destruction.That is basically the problem for the hero of this horror novel and those he tries to protect. They aren't your average scampering rodent, either, so that makes the job all the harder. So, pretty entertaining variation on the trapped by monsters theme, with an interesting ending to go along with it.3.5 out of 5"
2,Eh...,I didn't feel like this product worked well. Probably because it didn't come as a liquid gel. I'd check out a better quality brand.
1,Wrong item,The picture shown clearly shows 6 gold pins in each socket. What I received was only 4 silver pins in each socket. Not what I paid for. Too much hassle to send it back
1,Price - are you JOKING?,"I purchased this from Adorama Camera through Amazon last year and the year before, and at 3 boxes each time, still paid LESS THAN HALF what this appears to cost! Why would you pay $168 and change, plus tax and shipping when 25 of the same paper is less than $20????? I don't like math, but I'm smart enough to add it up - this is ridiculous!Bottom line - LOVE the paper - LOATHE this price when I can get it elsewhere for significantly less!"
3,Picture is of a smaller cousin of actual item,"While this product is good looking and well made, it is not very functional unless your pencils are 9"" long. The picture shown is not the product delivered."
4,For looking and thinking,"My 4-year-old grandson loves this book. He needs to have someone read the list of things to look for, but he will happily try to find the objects. He turns the page before it gets tedious so we finish the book quickly, but he will go back to it time and again. I believe that the mental effort is good intelligence training."
3,not bad,not badsome cool effectsnot your oscar winning performance and movie in overall but very entertaining and watchable
2,rather boring,"The storyline is pretty boring. The actors are ok, but Richard Grieco is more and more losing his charisma (of ""Booker""-days). It's not a cheap production as such, but the storyline is very weak."
1,Beware!,"Disappointing. I was expecting a DVD with music videos of Yanni concerts but the music was interrupted by Yanni talking his life etc. Only 1 piece was not interrupted. I should have read the reviews before buying! I hope Yanni will read these reviews, apologise and release a real DVD of his best works without any interruptions."
3,Great Book ...,"I've read about a quarter of the book and it is indeed a great book. The only disappointment I had is that the used paperback came with a ripped front cover. It didn't mention that when I went to purchase it on-line. The content of the book is fantastic, and the rest of the book itself was in good shape."
3,10bags only - description is misleading when says 4bags per pk,1pkg contains 10bags and that is all you get. I haven't used these yet so don't know anything else about them. But just the quantity issue is enough to comment at this point.
1,Product broke almost immediately,"I bought the Pet Skope to examine one of our cat's ears. She develops a lot of wax, and we're treating her. I've used the scope 3 or 4 times since purchasing it. Yesterday, it broke. Where the halves screw together the threads failed and it will no longer stay together. This makes the scope unusable since the battery and bulb no longer make adequate contact.I cannot recommend this product as it's construction appears extremely flimsy."
4,Ok but could improve 3.5 rounded to 4,"A very nice friend of my mom's bought this for me for my birthday. There are several problems with this. 1. The pieces are hard to make out. However you figure out in a few minutes and get used to it. 2. It keeps making an annoying beeping sound everytime i touched and moved a piece. After a couple hours, i figured out how to turn it off. 3. it moves fast and doesn;t simulate real tournament play.4. The lcd screen and the lay out isnt very appealing. However, this isn't all that bad. ITs pretty good for the money."
3,Teal Kimono Robe Butterfly design,"Average rating. Its just going to depend on personal tastes and expectations for this type of product.Bought it for girlfriend. She says she likes it. As a runner she is hovering in the size 2-4 range, and this ""one size fits all"" kimono appears large on her with a lot of gathering with the belt cinched.The material is quite thick...silkish on outside; unfinished and a tad rougher on the inside. I had expected something a bit more whispy. There were a few stray strands of thread at seams, and a slight snag mark in the teal fabric.Summary: the recipient seems pleased with it, heavier and larger than i expected, probably shouldve bought this type of product in person at a store though."
5,Marriage is a Miracle,"Mike Mason has written a gem, here, and I would highly recommend it to both husband and wife. Husbands, remember that you are reading from another man who is ""honest"" about what it is to be a man, and if you disagree, you need to pray about it. He takes the position that a man and woman are united together before God, and that there are many areas which the Holy Spirit needs to work on in us collectively, if we are going to show forth the glory of the Lord to a fallen society and world. It is highly recommended. For both husband and wife."
3,Vitamin E cream,"Smells good...not sure if it really works to reduce wrinkles (I haven't seen results but I'm not even half way through the product). Skin does feel soft. So, it at least works as a moisturizing lotion."
2,safflower seed,"Quality of the seeds were very poor, went thru the 5 pound bag by hand inspection and ended discarding at least two and half pounds.Would not purchase this product again."
1,Could do without the annotations...,"Having read the series when they first went to print, I was thrilled to get my hands on a hardbound edition containing all three books. The joy of experiencing them again is immeasurable; the only thing greater is the thought of sharing the magic with my children. However, the author's notes in the margins are quite annoying. They detract from the natural flow of the story and, even while I try to ignore them, my eyes are naturally drawn to them. When I have my children dive into the magical world of Krynn, it will be in an edition free of this annoying clutter. In it's original spendor, it's a 5 star plus..."
3,1911 pistol,"When i first got the product i loved it, it was heavy in the back with die-cast metal,the clip, trigger, & gears were all die-cast metal, but what the product information ""forgot"" to tell you was the whole slide and some of the plastic parts inside the gun were completly made out of cheap plastic, the plastic was just as strong as graphite. When i first opened my package the slide locked in place every time I tried to cock it, & when i brung it to my dad the plastic by the hammer broke off, and on the same day the plastic slide cracked, this all happened on the same day i got the gun. Otherwise i loved the gun, it looked really cool and i could have a real firm grip on the handle of the gun. My advice to you is to not get this gun and waste 25 dollars of your own money if you like to have airsoft wars, I suggest that you should only get this gun if you like to collect famous guns like the 1911. I hope you liked my review, i tried to be as real & as fair as i could about this gun."
2,Same old same old.,"This is just another Jakks wrestling figure made from recycled parts. It seems like they use a handful of parts they have used for a hundred other figures then throw a head and call it a day. I understand there is a problem with the arms on this figure, many people have reported one of them breaks off at the shoulder. I quit buying them because of the high cost for reused parts and getting figures that loose parts or arms and legs that don't stay on there sockets. The one I had the left arm came off at the ball joint at the shoulder. Avoid this one and any of them."
4,Great package deal but needs finer controlled remote,"If you are in doubt, buy this. My ONLY mild gripe is the remote is pretty simple and has a tendency to abruptly pan/jerk at the lightest touch. Speed control works good but try and follow someone on stage nice and slow and you get frustrated.I would happily pay more for a ""rocker"" switch to go with this. All other parts are 5 plus stars! I use this on a camera crane so I also bought the extension cable. Everything is solid and professionally built and it has endured countless deployments.Bescor, please make a joystick or rocker version accessory to go with this.If any of you know how to ""rig"" or modify this to incorporate a rocker switch please comment."
4,Works Great,"Works great, low humming sound, went unnoticed when the vehicle was running. Too much power for the cell phones, that was disappointing, but otherwise did a fine job for the laptop.Valerie"
2,Won't charge my phone.,"I have a HTC 6800, and it charges for a second, then acts as if it isn't plugged in. The charging indicator even turns off. Phone charges just find from ac adapter and house wall outlet."
5,power in the car,"used this to power my laptop on an 11 hour ride, This unit and my pickup extended the reach of my leaf blower past the extention cord..."
5,cheap inverter but works.,"I haven't used this on a long trip or anything just tested to see if it works and it does. i like how the fan only kicks on when u use power. so even if the inverter is on, the fan only turns on when u draw power. ill update once I've got more time using it.A plus is that it comes with both battery clips and cig lighter plug."
3,Don't buy this if you are planning to use for cordless tool charging,"This item works as advertised, but it is a modified sine wave inverter. If you are planning on using it to charge cordless tool batteries---don't. The owners manual contains a caution about using with cordless tool chargers (such as Dewalt). Do a quick Internet search on ""cordless tools"" and ""modified sine wave inverter"" to confirm whether your tool is effected. Some other items that may not work well are appliances with clocks, microwaves, etc. Be sure you understand the limitations of a modified sine wave inverter.For those smaller appliances that will run on modified sine wave, this item works well."
2,ONLY 100 WATTS THROUGH CIG LIGHTER!,its a little misleading because if you plug this into a cig lighter you can only get a max 100W. if you want higher wattages you have to connect it directly to the battery with the alligator clips. RTFMhttp://www.xantrex.com/web/id/551/docserve.asp
1,a fuse blower with inadequate instructions,"This heavy box has a completely inadequate manual. Upon the first test it blew the 15 amp lighter fuse in my otherwise indestructible Toyota 4WD truck, and I didn't even plug anything into the inverter itself! No amperage specs or warnings are included with it anywhere, and Amazon's website product description doesn't even describe what's included in the box when one buys the unit. At least they took it back...Maybe if the prospective buyer is an electrician and can pre-check with testing equipment this unit could be ok, but I have to call it my worst experience buying something from Amazon, bar none! Nuts to anything that harms my truck!"
2,Hold just right and it works,"I bought XPower because it was a good deal. We took a trip recently and plugged in our laptop, so the kids could watch a movie. The power would constantly cut off after only a couple minutes of use. We figured out that we could hold the XPower at a certain angle at it would work most of the time. Unfortunately we are past the 30 day period to return it. Maybe we just got a bad one? I would definitely recommend to try it out before the 30 day period."
5,shower caddy 1755,This is a good replacement for the one we had. They all rust away over time. With the rubber feet on this one it stays inplase.
5,just what we were looking for,just what we were looking for fits where we need it too. Won't rust or stain. My wife was really happy with it. I don't know what to write but we are happy with it;
4,Rudely funny,"Does everything that broadcast TV won't do. While very stereotypical of a section of gay life it raises serious questions about body fascism, monogamy, inter racial & inter generational relationships and family but does it all with humor. It doesn't really answer any of the questions it raises but then it's not meant to, its good nature fun that will offend those who find the idea of any type of gay relationship immoral or repugnant."
2,Derivative Pap!,"Knowing a little about the music of XTC, I bought this album based upon a friend's recommendation. I could have saved my money and listened to Sgt. Pepper and/or the White album. Not worth the effort at all."
1,Not As Advertised,"I have been shooting stills and video for more than 40 years and can honestly say this is the worst investment I have ever made. First I worked for more than 8 hours trying to get it balanced, even different size batteries on the camera requires readjusting. When I finally got it balanced and tried to shoot with it, the head floats with even a slight breeze or minor movement. Second, I cannot imagine anyone that can hold it for more than 3 minutes without being in extreme pain. It is hard to believe that the Glidecam 4000 can be used as a stand alone unit, by anyone. Third, when you open the box it's yours whether it works or not. The sample videos and photos make the unit look great but it is just slick advertising. Really Badddddd!!!"
4,Worth the Price,"I bought this gift basket for $.., which it is well worth it, tho not worth the retail price of over $... As others have stated in their reviews, the basket is nice and would be useful around the house, and the napkins are substantial and would be useful as well, other than as napkins which to me are small for napkins. My favorite thing in the gift basket is the mugs, which are heavy and will hold alot to drink. The food is so so. I liked the biscotti,the candy, the tea and the coffee, and cocoa, but the rest of the treats I didn't care for."
4,Great for Travel,"I used this pillow on my trip to Japan. It was very comfortable. I don't recommend using the headphones as they were much too loud. However, the pillow was comfortable for the trip."
1,Disappointing,"I initially ordered this for delivery as a present for my significant other while he is working on the road. Of the ""12 months"" of issues, I have only received 3.I will not be renewing my subscription."
5,Like Honor Harrington? This is Better!,"The first time I read this fabulous book, I read it straight through for the incredibly well realized adventure. Now, after having bought and gobbled up THE LONG HUNT, latest in the series, I had to go back and reread the entire series again. This time it's even better--not only the realistic detail about space ships, the military, and what it feels like to be in a blaster battle, but the humor, and best of all, the subtle hints about twists and turns to come. The publishers are wise to keep this one in print. It's going to be a classic"
3,A somewhat meandering plot,"Space pilot Beka Rosselin-Metadi is drawn into galactic intrigue after her mother, a political leader, is assassinated. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the assassins target Beka and her two brothers, none of whom have any particular political aspirations. That results in the assassins exposing themselves and inviting retaliation.This novel is described on the cover as ""Mageworlds Book One."" The story left me with the impression that I had missed a previous novel. The authors keep referring back to some supposed previous actions. Many of the novel's characters seem to be only partially developed.Overall, it is an average adventure novel. The heroine and her allies skip from planet to planet seeking the villains, leaving a trail of dead bodies behind. It is somewhat a Perils of Pauline type story as Beka escapes from a series of confrontations with her enemies."
4,Chris Cunningham knows music!,"I have been following Chris Cunningham's career for a while now. Mostly what impresses me about him and that draws me back time after time is his sense of harmony and rhythmn. He just really knows how to put a song together. He is great live too, becuase he will sing one of his songs ... the core of the song will remain but he will change it so you learn something new about it. But I guess you won't find that out on this track. I would say the best tracks is ""Wild and Restless Child"". Sixth Sense is no longer together as a band, but Chris has been putting together some solo stuff."
5,Fantastic Results,"I had my doubts about Zim's Crack Creme, but after having used it for two weeks I can not give enough praise to its results.I am a long distance runner and my heels started to dry andcrack about six years ago and nothing I used for this problemseemed to work. That was until I heard about Zim's Crack Creme.Now I believe."
2,Johnny Thunders-dead or alive?,"i popped this disc into my dvd player hoping to see an example of rock n roll fury.instead it left me dissappointed and wanting more.most of this disc is concert footage from 1984 in london with little black and white blips of footage from 1977 intertwined throughout.the 1984 footage is high quality but the band is awful and johnny is too strung out to play.very boring.the black and white footage is crappy but is an excellent example of the band's energy and power.it's unfortunate this footage isnt the exclusive subject of the disc. i'd recommend this to thunders completists only.it's worth it for the 77 footage and interviews alone,but it just doesnt do it for me.stick to the bootlegs brothers and sisters."
1,Deception Through Omission,"I have a copy of the original `The Heritage of Southern Cooking' by Camille Glenn, published by Workman Publishers, and it is a fabulous guide. We've yet to find a recipe that disappoints us. The problem with this edition is that it's `adapted' from the original. In this case, `adapted' means that they omitted a significant percentage of the recipes (I'm going to guess about half). There is nothing that indicates the significant difference between the two editions. My son had learned to appreciate the original and I was trying to provide him a copy. I was sorely disappointed at the deception."
5,Holy Toledo!,These movies are fantastic works of cinema. Problem Child 1 is perhaps John Ritter's best role ever. The Vomit Scene in Problem Child 2 is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.
3,A little too much profanity,Funny but not for children under the age of 14.I love John Ritter always makes me laugh but the language and some scenes were taboo.
4,BMW of a wagon,"The first time we used it was at the fair and 3 toddlers were able to fit on it. It was very easy to maneuver and didn't feel that we are hauling 3 children. It was very comfortable, light and strong. And the children were very at ease inside and didn't complaint at all."
4,Austrian point of view ? Wow ! Finally.,...FINALLY somebody wrote about Marengo from Austrian point of view..... Special thanks for the author and please more !Best Regards Zak
3,Fairly good account,"This book has a fairly good account of how this battle progressed. However, it also has some problems. One is that it is weak, unlike most Osprey book in this series, on providing some perspective on how and why this battle occured along with each side's goals (on both strategic and operational levels). Also, despite having good discussion of major officers/leaders, the discussion on the armies themselves (i.e., morale, training, equipment, etc.) is weak. Book also lacks color plates on each sides troops. Too much discussion also on wargaming this battle (aboout 5 pages out of a 100 page book)."
1,Disappointing,Product worked ok for a while and then the people I was speaking with on it began to complain - would not recommend it to others.
1,Blue Tooth connection has not worked,Have followed directions assiduously. Cannot make it connect with Treo 650.
4,Good Start,"Definately a good start for a 90s collection. Afew that the other review didnt mention as missing that I felt i should point out : Matchbox 20, Third Eye Blind, Incubus, and Fuel. Then the hundreds of bands that nobody remembers..."
4,A great piece of history.,"Alain Decaux give us in this book, an amazing work of investigation, ten chapters of history, as you never find in other book, with 20 o 30 pages per chapter, Decaux show how history can be fun, an a great enterteinment. The history of Champollion, the men who can traslate the jeroglifics. The tressure of the PLATA FLOTA, the enigma of the Pascua Island, the secret plan to kill Hitler, Joann of Arc, the last Emperor Pu Yi, and many more are the excelents chapters of this excelent book."
2,Disappointing,"At least half of this rather thin but costly book consists of general information about canine evolution, common dog breeds, physiology of the dog, selecting a puppy, housetraining, etc. The chapter on holistic feeding provides only very basic information that does not enable readers to create a balanced homemade diet for their dogs, and the sections on homeopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, and physiotherapy serve as little more than a brief introduction to these holistic therapies. Finally there is a short (15 pages) A-Z guide to the holistic treatment of some common canine ailments.There are far more comprehensive (and less expensive) books on natural dog rearing available."
3,"More of an ""Illustrated novel"" than a ""Graphic novel""","A nice try from the creators, but it relies far too much on extremely long text passages to tell the story. Very faithful to the original, as others have noted, but in the end, it's just too many drawings of Neville just sitting in a chair while the text tells the story."
4,Fair 'Nough,"I thought it was grrrreat, well to be exact, it wasnt bad but then again i had already seen the movie, so i was a huge question mark through most of the book, as i thought they had made a real ""book to film"" film, which i found out soon enough they hadnt. It was still a great novel, in my opinion, then again, im not that critic, i like most things that make my time go by, the only really annoying thing was that i bought the graphic by mistake, and im not all that fond of paperback so that was the only downside on my account, i was pleasantly surprised by the graphics as i thought they were greatly drawnPB"
5,Tenchi Universe: Time And Space Adventures,"""With this device, you can change the world the way you want!"" These three episodes are the original episodes which were cut out from the Tenchi CD because of lack of space. In my opinion these are the best episodes because you get to see the character's desires, dreams, and wishes. Princess Ayeka, in her parallel world, orders Mihoshi and Kiyone to eliminate Ryoko, Kiyone searches for a new peacful life without Mihoshi. Mihoshi, in her world, is married to Tenchi and lives as a housewife, and Ryoko is an American gangster in her world. One episode even includes a Magical Girl Pretty Sammy adventure. With the machine broken and the worlds combining, Washu is their only hope to return back to their ""semi-normal"" lives! These extremely funny episodes are a must have for all Tenchi fans!"
2,Last Review . . . Don't Bother.,"I didn't like this movie at all, in fact I think it was a waste of money."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution...","As a part-time rehabber, having an all-in-one bathroom lighting and accessories solution is a dream come true. Unfortunately, while this set looks good, the actual product is very flimsy and cheap feeling. This is especially true of the toilet paper holder, towel bar and towel hook. Everything is very, very thin and easily bent/damaged. (Not to mention that the paper holder is just, well, weird.) My reccomendation would be to look for something with a little more heft."
3,Great item for rental property,"I am remodeling the bathrooms in my rental property so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on extravagant fixtures but I still wanted the rooms to look nice. This is a great set to buy if you are looking to do just that. They are not great quality and the paint on the toilet paper holder was peeling right out of the box, but other than that they were great for what I am looking to accomplish."
5,Un roman à savourer,"Une femme est trouvée morte. Sa fille, Diane, voit la photo de sa mère dans le journal, par hasard. Elle avait coupé tout contact avec elle depuis quelques années.Troublée par ces retrouvailles à la morgue, Diane tente de comprendre toutes ces émotions qui l'envahissent, ainsi qu'en venir à bout. Elle prend congé de son travail, incapable de se concentrer sur le boulot et passe plus d'une nuit à se saouler dans les bars de Montréal. Elle fera également connaissance avec cette mère qu'elle n'a jamais vraiment connue.Une histoire qui ne laissera aucun lecteur de glace, écrite dans le style impeccable de Marie Laberge. Ce roman présente des personnages réels, attachants, avec lesquels vous passerez des moments bouleversants."
3,HammerHeadFlyerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!,"First, I like just about everything to do with Space A & B, with that said the book was fun ,BUT it was not written by TELEP and you could tell. The orignal Space: Above and Beyond and Demolition Winter and by far the BEST and are worth the read. The other books are O.K."
5,It's all in the details!,I've bought quite a few of these quickie books. Some are good. Some are awful.This one goes way beyond the others. It's all in the details. Details on how to save files. Details on how to slice objects. Details on how to create rollovers. Details on optimizing. Details on everything.I've been carrying my copy around so much that the cover is about to fall off.
2,VISUAL QUICKSTART? PERHAPS TOO QUICK IN WRITING THE BOOK,"Ack, I'm beginning to HATE these VQS guides.This book is more straightforward than the DW VQS, however, often it leaves you hanging and wondering.Peruse thru some chapters at your local bookstore, and you'll see what I mean. I've come to realize these budget books are no good.How good can a $20 book possibly be? But unfortunately, there aren't too many beginner-intermediate FIREWORKS books out there.I recommend you read FIREWORKS F/X and Design after you torture yourself thru this book. If you find a better book, let me know, but I doubt b/c I've searched enough. PLAYING WITH FIRE isn't that great; if you're smart and compare PLAYING WITH FIRE to the F/X book, you'll quickly see the F/X book is by far better. Slightly more difficult, but hey, you want to learn FIREWORKS or not?"
5,Interesting even for those who are not baseball fans,"This is a surprisingly interesting book even if you aren't a baseball fan. An enterprising team owner and upcoming sports equipment magnate, Spalding sought to gain more visibility for the American pastime by doing exhibition games around the world over the course of six months in 1888-89. The book really is much more about the experiences of a group of Americans, mostly young men (several wives came along), visiting exotic places and behaving like, well, a bunch of young men would on a rather incredible road trip. Lamster is a very good writer who carries the story along with fun anecdotes and never bogs down in moralizing or schmaltz. Highly recommended."
5,Totally Pleased,"It is so much easier to order my calcium supplement from Amazon than trying to hunt them down in the stores! With the free shipping that is offered, it is cost effective as well!"
2,Like watching an all-day marathon of COPS,"If the TV show COPS was based on a book, this is that book. The author compiled the material by going on ridealongs with the San Diego Police Department, which was the only department willing to let him to write about them.Ridealongs were introduced to the SDPD as a part of the COP (Community-Oriented Policing) program which aimed to give the community a better understanding of policework. According to the author, the program was the first of its type in the nation and was established by Norm Stamper. While far from the main focus, the book includes some background and snippets of interviews with Stamper, who years later went on to become the Seattle Police Chief, resigning after the WTO riots.If you love watching COPS, you'll enjoy this book, otherwise leave it alone."
1,RIPOFF! DO NOT BUY!,"Warning! These are carefully recrafted songs made to sound very much like the original artists, but they are not! The CD labels even give the original artist names, but these are definitely not the original versions or artists. Furthermore, there is no indication anywhere on the CD that the labels are a lie. I'm surprised that this is even legal. I'll try to get a refund, . Shame on any retailer that even carries this ."
4,Good Product,Seems to be helping me feel better each day. My doctor suggested this and it hopefully will keep cancer at bay.
1,a music fan,this cd sounds like a bunch of old geezers have risen from the grave and rleased a new album.give me a break!
1,Not worth the money!,"If you are looking for something discussed in great details, say, topic on Multi Threading, consider other books written specifically for that topic.Every topic in this book is poorly discussed and ends right before you decide to dig more into it."
5,Not a disappointment!,"This soundtrack has grown on me more and more as I listen to it. GLADIATOR was my top favorite film of 2000, the score my top favorite score. And while some complain that there isn't enough new music, I disagree. I love the new transcription of Maximus's theme for guitar, so pensive and elegant, and ""Rome is the Light"", an alternate version of ""Now We Are Free,"" which is full of hope and courage. And I, personally, like the additions of dialogue as a contrast to the first album. I particularly liked the addition of the music ""Homecoming"" when Maximus escapes his Praetorians and rushes for Spain.I guess I just can't get enough of this music ..."
2,More Money From Gladiator Fans,I have some issues with this release:1. There was enough space left on the 1st CD to include the additional movie tracks.2. We don't need no stinkin' dialog!3. We don't need no stinkin' remixes!4. I have no emotional attachment to scores that were not used in the film.There should have been a single CD with all the major musical themes and they should've been in chronological order.Just my 2 cents.
3,Er,Just wanted to comment to the initial review saying that Vivian Hsu was cashing in on her stardom. Vivian actually made this BEFORE she got really popular. It's a good film if you like Vivian.
1,You're much better off reading C. S. Lewis,"Although I share Schaeffer's world view, I find his presentation to be muddled, half-baked, and not a little pretentious. In fact, I secretly use him as a litmus test for identifying the kind of Christian who does not want to be challenged but only wants to read what he already believes. Schaeffer was a master at oversimplifying complex philosophical positions and he typically built up straw men, the easier to knock them down. But, worst of all, he is simply an atrocious writer. Paragraphs appear randomly strung together, an annoyingly self-evident sentence will be juxtaposed with a hopelessly abstruse one, and he repeats himself to distraction. His lack of real relevance is evident from the fact that he is already falling into obscurity (note the sales rank of his books compared with those of C. S. Lewis). Not very kind words, I know, but you would do much better to read the Oxford don and put your extra-Biblical devotional time to far more rewarding use."
1,disappointing,I keep trying to give the Bone solo albums a shot. However with the exception of earlier solo efforts these latest albums are not that good. Every time I am disappointed. This cd has nothing on the L-Burna album. There are too many cameos from rappers unskilled(caz) and the production is weak. I wish for the good ol days again. Keep trying though because one day they will give us more love. Streangth and Loyalty shows us promise.
1,relunctant reviewer spews venom,"This movie was filmed in pitchblackarama as are most D class horror flix. What a waste of primo eye candy. On the other hand,Sam Worthington, as the hero's sidekick, manages to shine through and is funny and charmming as a one-armed zoombie."
3,I enjoyed this more than I thought I would,After reading some harsh reviews I thought this was going to be awful. I actually thought it was pretty good as far as b movie standards go. One thing I found refreshing was that it wasnt bombarded with CGI effects. There were some genuinely funny moments as well as some pretty cool monster effects. all in all you could do much worse.
3,"Poor Quality Guitar, Good Customer Service","This guitar arrived in very poor condition(dents, scratches, poorly painted) and played terribly terribly terribly - but their customer service dept was helpful straightening it out."
1,Just a Toy...,"I just got this guitar in the mail, and as soon as I pickes the box up, it was very light weight, that was my first sign that something was wrong. Then, when I opened the box there was the guitar, but it was so crappy. The strings are so thin that one of them broke on the first day (and I'm a really careful person), the actual guitar is very thin, and the paint was done very poorly. The head part of the guitar doesn't look anything like the one in the preview, and I cant find where you put hook up the strap on one end. Please I beg of you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It may be inexpensive, but you should save your money for something better!...oh and the frets are messed up too!!!"
5,Great gifts make happy holidays!!,"the guitar is exactly what we wanted and though we had shipping issues with fedex.com, my son truly enjoyed his present!!! there is nothing better than giving a gift that makes someone happy and this gift turned out to be wonderful!!"
2,"Strangely, the game is better then the book.","Most of the time the book is better then the movie, etc.Not this time.Maybe it was my fault for playing the game through before reading the book, but this book was run of the mill fantasy dribble.I read it through in two days but i cant say that that was because of how enjoyable it was. I read it quick so i can move onto another book.As of right now the game can probably be got for as little as this book. If youre interested in DnD or Planescape, pick up the game. You wont be sorry.But stay away from this book!"
3,Real Fantasy...,"I liked this book. Story is very good and rare, i never get bored while reading , a full of fast action and unexpected scenes inside, fantasy fans must definitely read ...."
4,If you liked the game...,... you'll love the book. If you havent played the game then you won't. This book helps fill in a lot of questions re: the Nameless One and is a pleasant complement to the game.A lot of fun.
1,insulting and degrading to a great legacy,"Is it unfair to rate a book in the shadow of what it's based upon? In this case, I definetly think so. Even though my strong feelings for the original computer game might cloud my judgment, I still feel that this waste of paper, ink and time didn't deserve to see the light of day. Besides adulterating all the characters, both physically and psychologically, it also destroys the plot - in my opinion, the best to ever grace a computer game. It might have been saved through its own merits, maybe solid plotting, colourful characterization, smooth action or insightful writing, but it failed abysmally in all of those. An utter disgrace and a shameful blemish in the Planescape legacy, and the first book I've ever actually thrown into the garbage bin. Why did they even bother? A line-by-line transcription of the game's script would have been better than this, and better written, besides."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed that on this Blue's Tunes player, only one of the six songs are Blue's Clues songs. If the synopsis had mentioned what songs were on the player, I would NOT have bought it. There is also no volume control on this, as on so many children's toys. You'd think a player named ""Blue's Clues Blue's Tunes"" would actually have all it's tunes from Blue's Clues. Also disappointed it was just the music and no words, and that the barking sound that is supposed to be Blue before the songs isn't an actual recording of Blue--it's an obvious copy. All this said, my 2 year old son likes it well enough as it has Blue's picture on it."
4,Pretty Nice Pool,"I'm happy with the size and appearance of this pool. The plastic seems reasonably thick and durable and I had no problem blowing it up CAREFULLY with my air compressor (I just put the duster nozzle up against each of the pool's three air intake valves, even though they discourage the use of a compressor...). When I went to put the pool away at the end of the weekend, I started to empty it by siphoning the water out but that was just taking too long. So, I just deflated it and let the water run over the sides. For $40.00, I think it's good value and if it lasts the summer I'll feel that I got my money's worth."
3,You can get it for $25 at Walmart.,"Overall, it is a great, cheap pool if you can't afford a real one. I have to fill it with air about every other day, but that's probably expected for any kind of blow-up pool. It's just the right size if you have really young kids because it is big enough for me to sit in, yet small enough that I am pretty much within arms or my child at all times. The only thing I thought was a rip was the price. I thought I was getting a great deal until I saw it at Walmart (exact same pool) for $25."
3,Totally MISLEADING,"Although my son likes the video, it has very little time devoted to Christmas as advertised. I believed it to be a movie not 3 little short stories. I was looking forward to a good holiday movie to excite my two year old about Christmas and be helpful on long car rides. The Christmas story only got me 20 minutes down the road!"
2,Not a movie..just three t.v. episodes on a dvd,"I was really disappointed with this purchase. Like everyone else says...it's not a movie, just three episodes of the television show. You can compare it to the dora video all you want, but I have never paid almost $20 for a Dora dvd."
3,Overpriced,"We love Mickey Mouse club house for our kids and have seen this episode many times on Disney. Finally, we broke down and bought it. Way overpriced for a single episode. This episode is neat though and our kids love it. If it was $8 it would be 5 stars"
4,Good Choice,My 6 month old absolutely loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse so I was excited to find the Christmas dvd. Although I didn't personally care for the Santa episode it had 2 more episodes on the dvd which kept my litle one occupied for quite sometime.
1,mistakenly ordered,I am not happy because I could not delete this order right after making it. i did not want to order this in the form of a download or to watch on sn ipad. I wanted the actual dvd so my daughters can take the dvd with them on trips.
2,Cupid in London's Grand Hotel,"Cupid comes calling in this anthology with London's luxurious Grand Hotel as the constant setting.Like many anthology series, the stories are hit and miss. But strangely, the only one I enjoyed (and that remained in my memory) was the contribution from the popular Anne Barbour. Her characters were charming and was a very enjoyable read. Other than that I have trouble picking out any one story that stands out in my memory. They all ran together in a blur for me without any notable distinguishing features. I guess I didn't enjoy it very much as a whole, preferring to settle on one story I can sink my teeth into."
3,Good for the Cuban aficionado.,"This is a book written by someone who knows more about Cuban cigars and making an attractive package, then books.This is a pair of books packaged in a single hardcover binder, tied shut with a brown ribbon. The package makes a good coffee table display peice. It would be a shame to pack it away where it couldn't be seen.The writing, however, reads like a series of articles rather than a well planned discussion of cigars. Very poorly written. A tremendous bias towards Cuban cigars is also present. Imagine, if you will, a book about automobiles... in which the only recommendations are that you buy Roll Royce. Cubans are the un-paralleled pinnacle of the cigar smoker's world, having smoked them on a trip to Canada I can certainly attest. However, to reduce the world of cigars to nearly one nation, as this book does, is limiting.Buy this book if you want to LOOK well educated about cigars... or if you want to convince yourself that only a Cuban will do."
5,My Favorite Manga Series!,"I picked this one up thinking that it would be good to try something new. I'm really glad that I did, because this is now my favorite manga, and that's really saying something because I have 17 different series. This series is just plain wonderful. The situations in the series are so funny that I've laughed out loud when reading it, and the art is wonderful. Definitely something to get."
1,Hogwash Followup to Hogwash,I have read the other book and this one is a continuation of the hogwash material. This sums up what I feel about both books. Not worth buying.
5,Mesmerizing and Passionate,"The first time I heard the song INSIEME A TE on a compilation CD, I was mesmerized - I had to find out who the singer was. I fell in love with that voice; dark, majestic, powerful and quite unlike the tenor voices I've heard before.The very first time I listened to this CD in its entirety, I was totally blown away. The songs on this album are all superbly arranged and beautifully sung. I love the fact that they are all originals. Just listen to track no. 6 ('Stu Bbene) if you want to know just how passionate and expressive Mr Safina can sing.I think he deserves so much more recognition than what he's getting now. On my part, I will keep buying his CDs. I'm eagerly awaiting his next album, Sognami, due out some time middle of this year."
3,Not one of my favourites,"Yes Mr Safina has a lovely, powerful voice. Unfortunately someone has convinced him that his top notes are wonderful. I don't agree, his voice becomes strained. I prefer him singing more softly, but each song is sung in the same style. Each starts off very promisingly and then reaches these crescendos which don't sit well on my ears (and I don't have anything against crescendos). We all have different tastes and so far Mr Safina has been getting good ratings,except for one other; I'm just sorry I couldn't give him a higher score. I didn't even finish listening to the CD. Perhaps I will give it a another go later.2007-07-16 I have listened again and I suggest that Mr Safina sticks to opera and ballads with better arrangements that suit his voice. His voice is too rich for the feeble arrangements and orchestration(?) on this CD."
2,Game Gear has to have better,"I got this game because when I bought my new Game Gear I knew that new games wouldn't be around much longer. I bought something off Amazon before and I figured since I still had an account I thought I should use it. Not many games were left at the time so I picked this up and Aladdin. The game had great graphics, for a hand-held anyway, but the game was just boring. Walking around as Donald Duck and kicking stuff isn't what I call fun. After getting to the second level and not being able to beat the part with Donald swimming away from the shark, I gave up.The problem with this game is that everybody tries to make platformers. Not all platformers are good, most are actually really bad. This game would fall into the mediocre area."
5,PERFECT BAG!,"I ordered this bag the week after our son was born and we take it EVERYWHERE! We have used this bag for 16+ months now and that means EVERYDAY! My son came to work with me for the first year of his life (a huge blessing -- I know) and the bag carried everything I needed...all of his stuff, my breast pump, extra bottles, my lunch, and even doubled as my purse for that first year (because you don't have enough hands otherwise!). This bag is absolutely perfect and is still like brand new -- which is great as I'll be using it for baby #2 who is on the way and it will be used as everything once again!"
1,Long lasting?,"I was excited about this bag, but after two weeks of use both straps were ripping from the bag. I was hoping to use this bag for a long period of time. Now I have to buy another. I would NOT recommend this bag to anyone!"
1,!!!!Major Disappointment!!!!,"This old favorite has been ruined...It really doesn't teach kids today the lessons we adult's learned from this game when we where kids. Dig up an old one if you can for some real ""Life"" fun!"
4,A Must Have!,I love how fun this game is! My family and I first discovered Life at a garage sale! The version we got must of been the first because it was so funny and not to mention beat up!!!! We all said it was stupid but I think that we all secretly had a blast with it!!! Now we have most of the versions and are practically collectors!! I really think everyone should enjoy this game in their own homes!!!!
4,"Good product, pretty sturdy","This is a nice product, decently priced. It's pretty sturdy. I have my 24"" LCD flat screen monitor standing on it and it's not sagging at all.At 7"" deep, this is much less deep than ""desk risers"" (which tend to be 12"" deep), which is good because I only needed 7"" width to support the base of my monitor. Also, it's wide enough to slide a laptop underneath it between the legs. (It's also barely wide enough to slide my keyboard under it, but YMMV, depending upon the width of your keyboard. Space inside the legs is 18.75"" from left to right.)"
3,"Great sound, great performances, inferior CPE Bach music","The title says it all. These cantatas sound like his father's most boring works in the genre and do not show his own genius very well, but the performances are technically excellent and the sound is great."
4,What? No one else has bothered to review it?,"This lovely CD was given to me as a gift from a good friend. Please consider purchasing it and sharing it with a good friend as well. Fans of tasteful guitar / ensemble playing will enjoy it greatly. Not 100% Gypsy/Django style (they already have plenty of those CD's...), but thoughtfully arranged cover tunes (Santana, Al DiMeola, Johnny Mandel, Glenn Miller,etc.) that fans of instrumental music with listen to for many years to come."
1,Trash for Cash,"Reviewer: John R Iler Jr from Bethesda, MD, USAThis book needs a CD. I purchased the book to learn PageMaker, but was referred to a website to download the required files. Some of the files were downloadable, but the instructor files were not accessable -- and these files are necessary for completing the assignments.Unfortunately, this book is used by many instructors. My instructor has been promising us the files for weeks on disk, but so far hasn't delivered.If you want to learn PageMaker, buy Classroom in a Book by Adobe and save yourself a lot of heartache (It's got a CD with everything you need). Besides, Mr. Proot's style of instruction is less than clear, and while this download the files yourself approach may save the author some $$$ in not having to include a CD, it's a very weird way of doing business. The book is a ripoff. Big time.-"
1,Use On-Line Help,"Despite the author's own wonderful review of the book, and every book that she has written to date, ""very interesting"" I was very disappointed. Look at the cover; it should let you understand the lack of her industry engineering and manufacturing experience. Can you address the features another ways besides designing parts that people will not make? Overall, I found this book a waste of my time and money. But my company paid for the book. I am not too mad. I will not even use the book as a reference book."
1,Poorly done,"Put simply, this is a poorly written book. Ten pages into the book and I began to wonder if it was really written by a Professional Engineer. The explanations in this book are poorly organized and difficult to follow. Intermediate Level? I wouldn't consider this to have covered any information that is useful at the beginning level.After going through this book, I would say that using the Inventor's help menu is easier than trying to make sense of this book. I am returning this book."
3,Book itself is great but product is not...,"I started reading this book right away and on the third day the book started falling apart.... literally! The binding in this book was not holding all the pages so the pages in the first 3rd of the book are falling out of the binding. I was so disappointed.My fault though because I got distracted with events going on so when I remembered, it was too late to get a replacement, Apparently it cannot be done! I am soooo disappointed.

3,Good but not great,"If you're a collector of books and a serious collector of small arms this book is great. If you are trying to find details of a specific version of the 1903 Springfield rifle this isn't the book for you. Not enough specifics about the versions of the '03 that most people would happen to own. It is an excellent reference for the why's and how's of the rifle's existance but again, not enough about the myriad of versions and variations that came from the three major manufacturers."
1,If there was an option for negative stars I would select it.,"This book was a major disappointment and the author has given nothing new or important to the arena of Options Trading. Given that his highest recommendation is to buy out of money options in hope of a ""long shot"" as he puts it, I think I will look elsewhere to find better risk / reward set up's and a more strategic plan.His ""secrets"" are 1 page of non-sense followed by his unwarranted bragging about how he profited from a trade similar to the strategy he explained.All in All, this book is a joke and waste of time to anyone serious about trading options."
1,waste of time and no value,"I can't imagine that there could be a worse book than this on this subject; what a waste of time. The entire contents could be summarized in one chapter, the rest is pointless and misleading waffle. It really is a waste of time to read a 310-page book that offers neither insight nor knowledge. Indeed, I'd be bankrupt if used his methods. I concede that the author is an expert in the field, but unfortunately in this book he doesn't want to teach readers anything real or useful from his own experience; instead he spends almost the whole book marketing himself and his services."
1,W T H Was I Thinking?,"The title pretty much says it all.The trailer was more entertaining than the movie.Definitely a loser of a movie, and $0.99 for the rental would have left me feeling cheated, so now I feel cheated four times over for $3.99 rental.Want to waste $4.00 and save yourself some time, then throw your money in a river and walk away."
5,Little House on the Prairie - Season 3 DVD,Brings back family memories of all my children watching this show together with my husband and I every Wednesday night at 8:00 PM. Entertaining for all ages.
5,Great tv show,"Little House is iconic television, and, because it's a 'period' story, won't go out of style as modern dramas might."
1,I had to return three different pans due to damage.,I had to return three different pans due to damage.The aluminum is very thin and fragile.I gave up trying to get a pan that was not damaged.Eventually decided for refunds and gave up on getting an undamaged replacement.
5,Start here... first place to get a grip and then refer back.,"Buying a stack of Flash 5 books is a reasonable approach tostudy the software... ""BUT"" if your AS time and budget chalanged as most of us trying to keep up with the upgrade additions of the chip makers and then the wonderful software providers: MacroMedia, Adobe, 3DStudio Max to name a couple. ""THIS IS THE SINGLE BOOK TO BUY... AND GET IT IN THE NUTSHELL... WITH HANDS ON EXERCISES THAT WORK - 95% OF THE TIME""! THEN... MOVE OUT WITH ACTIONSCRIPTING... IN YOUR SKILL SEEKING."
2,Not enough bang for bucks,"I was hoping for the book to give me lots of useful flash tips that tonz of other books don't cover, and found it quite disappointing that's not the case at all. It does, however ,cover a lot of basics that whoever's into flash for a while will not appreciate much. If you've browsed some other flash books to get basics down, you wanna pass on this one. There's some other flash books that will give you inspiration and teach you lots of neat things. I actually just browsed this book at a local book store to decide to buy it or not. I hope they will come up with an advanced flash book soon."
3,good but not great,"We bought this nursery center for our daughter's 2nd bday. It's a good toy but not great. There are too many small pieces and the mobile has broken. She is now five and still plays with the main center part, but everything else either is lost or broken. I wish we would have gotten a different nursery set."
4,The truths we don't see,"The Blindfold's Eyes is a tragic tale told by a broken woman. This shows how a brutal 24 hours can linger for a lifetime. Sistor Dianna's tragedy was horrific, proven by the way she releases the actual events of that day. Piece by piece, so things she will not even reveal. What caught my attention was the underlying story she presented when dealing with the US government. The lack of concern for this case and the cases of many others from Guatemala was astounding. The deciet and treachory that occurs so they our government could continue selling arms, training soilders, and talking peace (which was an utter joke) was disgusting. I commend Sister Dianna on being brave enough to put her horror to words, to stand in front of the government and point her finger, and to go on, rebuild, and learn to live again."
1,Deceptive packaging,"The product is OK, but the packaging is deceptive. More than half the jar is a false bottom. You think you are getting way more than what you actually do."
5,RECOLLECTIONS OF A TIBETAN,"An amazing book of poetry by a truly gifted writer!Tsoltim N. Shakabpa writes philosophically, yet forthrightly about his life's experiences through the medium of poetry which he uses with the flair of a true genius. This Tibetan poet deserves the Noble Prize for literature!"
2,annoying characters,"Only due to my incapacity to put down a book once started, I finished to read this one. I found the main characters impossibly annoying. Rannulf is described as obtuse and arrogant, prone to rage's outbursts, and incapable of better judge his actions or take responsibility for them. In addition, the author manages to deeply convince the reader that Rowena is nothing but a greedy, ambitious, snotty woman. So when finally she comes to her predictable recognition to be in love with the man and not with his castle that sounds totally unbelievable."
5,Fun Read,"I usually don't read romantic novels. Not finding any historical mysteris that appealed to me, and the 5 in 1 offer on the Seasons Set, lead me to purchasing the set. I found this first book in the series to be entertaining, and have now read all of the books in the set. I prefer mysteries, but will probably read the other books by Denise Domning."
4,A Winter's Heat,"Loved it, kept me awake all night.. Good story and a pretty accurate portrayal of medieval life.. Lost a point though because although the bitch died the damage was still inflicted because miscarriage happened.."
4,Loved it!,I enjoyed this book very much. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to download the other books that follow this one!!
5,Worked Great,"This worked great on our dirty cat. He didn't mind it at all, and came out smelling so nice, and looks great. It was easy to use. Definitely plan to use it on our others soon."
1,I'd like to hear it first,"I ordered this CD on May 19 and I have not yet received it.Please advise as to what to do about this. I know I have been charged and I would like to think this doesn't happen very often. You might know, the first time I order CD's off the net and one of the 3 doesn't arrive."
2,Fake Cowboy boot,I bought this pair of boot with my cowboy outfit.These boots have an authentic look but are made of thin and soft plastic. They are suitable for one time halloween costume wearing or western photo sessions but not for prolonged use. For the same price you can buy a more durable pair of boots at a department store clearance section.
3,doesn't work with windows 7 64 bit,"worked like a charm with my Mac, a little more involved with windows 7 32-bit, and it's a no-go with Windows 7 64-bit due to the lack of MS signature on drivers. You can try Broadcom drivers, but IMHO, Jabra should probably just get their driver signed and save the consumer headaches.If you're savvy enough, you can hack your way thru the 64-bit OS install, but it's not easy for a nubie.just sayin."
3,Mixed feelings,I have just read all of the reviews and must say that after watching the episodes and hearing an alarming amount of the music replaced the negative reviews are correct and should not be criticized. I totally disagree with comments like we should just accept the replaced music and let life go on. That's saying we should settle and those who do sell themselves short. We deserve the very best from one of the greatest shows ever made. I hope they will make replacement discs for season three volume two. Loyal customers deserve this. As far as season four goes I think CBS should be very meticulous as regards the music even if it means that we the customer pay more. You get what you pay for. If season four comes out at a higher price with the correct music it will be well worth the money.
3,"The Fugitive: Season Three, Vol. 2","With this volume marks the end of season 3 for The Fugitive. The writing and acting remain superb and the show seems timeless with the stories and how Richard Kimble can escape from being caught. The video and audio quality are excellent, probably better than when it was originally aired. Again, for those die hard fans you will notice some of the music changed in scenes, this is unfortunate and as for me I don't like it at all. A quality series such as The Fugitive should not be tampered with. This has plagued the DVD release of the series since the first volume was released. Alot has been said and complained about and still the music gets changed. For a die hard Fugitive fan its a must have and has to accept the music changes. I can't wait for the next and final volumes to come out....IN COLOR!!"
2,"Just finished watching Season Three, Vol.2....Not good.","I heard of all of the negative reviews about season 3 vol.2, so I didn't buy it. Instead, I checked this out from the Public Library the other day, the picture quality and sound was excellent, but they really butchered this up with the crappy synthesizer music again like on previous volumes, only WORSE! Sometimes the music was so loud, you couldn't hear any dialogue from the actors, it just overpowers it. I feel like I am listening to the current Twilight Zone on the radio with Stacy Keach and all of these new actors and music with it. TERRIBLE!!!! I am NOT going to waste my money buying this!!!! Hopefully, someday, CBS/Paramount will change their tune and do it right 100%!!!"
1,For Amazon Product Description...Not The Fan,"My rating is for the product description, not the fan. I ordered two of these for a covered outdoor patio based on the description supplied by Amazon, which stated in part ""...the bronze Oasis wet-rated indoor/outdoor ceiling fan..."" This fan is not for outdoor use. I confirmed this with Hunter Customer Support. I had to return the two fans, which was made very simple with Amazon's outstanding customer support. So if you are looking for an outdoor fan I suggest you look at the Hunter Bayview model #23980 Ceiling Fan. This fan is for outdoors; however, it does not come with a light kit, but you can add one (Hunter Light Kit #23977) for an additional cost."
3,"Nice fans, but no chain weight?","Fans were easy to install, love the dual finish on the propellers. Not really sold on the fake alabaster look with the air bubbles embedded into the light shades, but it'll do for now. Very quite fans. My biggest complaint is that neither fan (I bought 2) had a chain weight. One of the fans didn't even come with extension chains. Dissapointed I got to spend another $20 for chains and weights."
5,love this show even tho it was 40 yearsago I first watched it.,"Frank Inn the trainer of the chimps was my fiancees great uncle, he was a very talented trainer and the work with these chimps was great,her aunt, his daughter, has the ashes of the first one along with arnold the pig. He orignally wanted them buried with him but that wasn't allowed ."
3,"Good, but...","I would give this 3.5 stars if that was an option. Sunny sings like someone who would be a great lover if she could let go. She cannot. Sunny has an endearing voice, decent chops and knows how to sing. Larry Willis provides excellent arrangements and exquisite piano. Joe Ford's reeds and the Rick Schmidt Strings bolster the date. The CD is marred by Sunny's relentless restraint and the darkness and lack of presence of the rhythm section in the mastering."
5,A treasure chest of ideas,"This book is a real treasure chest of ideas for an amateur robot builder. It does not show solutions in enough detail to copy them, but it points you in the right direction.For me some of the most interesting topics covered were:- Motorola M68332 based general purpose robot controller board,- Introduction to different robot competitions,- Simplified image processing solutions,- Walking robots and evolutionary programs to control the gait,- Examples of real life robots."
4,Some nice projects,"If you are looking for a relatively simple project for cross-stitching, this is a good book. It's a little too simple for me."
4,"Handy but not a ""Must Have""","I purchased this because I already owned the Litheon Pocket Driver. I was so impressed with that one, I purchased the I driver hoping it would be as good. While it's a nice tool, it's usefullness is somewhat limited. I haven't found the task that only this tool would work for. I find it a little bulky & unbalanced. It is however well made and consider it a quality tool that will last under job site conditions.It seems to stay in my truck as I often reach for the pocket driver instead. I don't regret buying it as I'm sure one day the job will come where only this tool will get it done and I'll be glad I had it on hand."
2,bosch vs dewalt,"Well dewalt is clearly better if you can have only one or two drivers in your tool box the chuck is ok- even the chucks on cheap drivers are ok. It is good for tight places, doesn,t have much power, probably as much as i'd expect from a 3.6 volt driver and the electric clutch is not as good to screw as mechanical clutches People will probably disagree with me, but I own and use 6 different drivers and that's my opinion. Not good for large screws, too weak, and the clutch adjustment is dismal if you are looking an accurate and consistent setting. I hope bosch works on improving these shortcomings so the tool can live up to the bosch reputation. For drilling ,don't waste your time."
5,Works Great,"What can I say they work as intended, they are of solid consturction, very durrable after installation, very long shelf life. Would buy them again."
5,high energy,"We love this Clove CD. We first saw Clove live at a college bar several years ago and now own two of their CDs. They are a high energy, feel good band. I LOVE Jen's vocals and this CD!!"
1,Nothing new or worthwhile here,"As one who has been knitting in the round, and only in the round, for 50 years, I can attest that there's nothing new or worthwhile here. Elizabeth Zimmermann said it far better long ago. Her daughter, Meg Swansen, has followed in EZ's footsteps, providing excellent instruction in circular knitting and also advancing these techniques. Many others have done the same: Barbara Walker, Priscilla Gibson-Roberts, Beth Brown-Reinsel, to name just a few. This book completely ignores the work of these and other experts; it offers exactly six pages of the most basic instruction in circular knitting and then launches into pages and pages of simple and often downright ugly designs. If you are serious about knitting in the round, look to those who have perfected this technique. This book offers you absolutely nothing."
2,It's just OK,"I can't figure out if it's the photography or the patterns but honestly nothing really jumps out or stands out in this book, it is the same old stuff and I agree that you would be better served getting an EZ book instead."
5,good selection of french songs and music.,"I liked these simple songs. The cassette was well done- nice singing - though the background music is a synthasizer- not real instraments. The words, pronunciation and pictures are clever and interesting for a child."
4,where country and alternative meet with beautiful results,"This might be the best release of 1998 that you've never heard. People like to compare these guys to early REM, but really they are more of a guitar band, not as sparce sounding as REM was back in the 80's. This album is very guitar heavy and extremely loud, yet it still has a very innocent feel, mainly do to the country influence that creeps into just about all the songs. Lyrically they remind me of Tori Amos, in that you are lucky if you can make sense of two to three lines in each song, yet those lines set the tone for the entire song. The lyrics certainly make the songs all the more interesting. Singer John Crooke sounds like he's been around and experienced a lot in life. ""Life"" is pretty much what these songs are about. Take a listen to ""Pensacola"" and you will be hooked on Jolene for sure. Also, the production on this album is top notch. It has a very glossy feel to it, yet it never loses intensity."
4,the BEST game gear game!!!,"after playing DEEP DUCK TROUBLE, and ALADDIN, i finally got jungle book for the game gear. Deep duck trouble must be the WORST game of all time! anyways, in JUNGLE BOOK, i think it is the ONLY game gear game where u can actualy ATTACK. the other games i played on game gear the ONLY thing you could do is JUMP! how boring. i love jungle book u can actually attack the enemies. you have to find 8 gems to pass the level, and u can to climb vines. the only bad thing is, that its a lil too hard. i never got passed the first stage"
2,A variable sampler,"This CD is a collection of tracks by various Dorian recording artists. About half are from existing CDs and the other half are previously unreleased.Some pieces are delightful -- Guillou's organ playing, and Rangell's rendition of Sheep Safely Graze on the piano are crisp and uplifting. Many other tracks are innovative, for instance, Risk and Petros manage to make Bach sound like a Celtic jig, which probably while intriguing, didn't give me any deep insight into Bach's music. Some other tracks are simply dutiful, a well played student recital, or simply don't reach the performer's usual height (e.g., NY Kammermusiker and Chatham Baroque)."
3,There are three LP OR CD,"Hello there are three LP or CD by Donald Byrd and 125th Street.They are Donald Byrd and 125th Street, N.Y.C. the First one. Second Love Byrd. Number three is Word,Sounds,Colers,and Shape. Love Has Come Around is on the Love Byrd CD or LP. There best cd is the Love Byrd CD or LP."
1,not what's expected,"non elastic at all, doesn't fit the size. don't deserve any explanation...non elastic at all, doesn't fit the size. don't deserve any explanation..."
1,it made me barf,"this book is a disgrace to witches, they claimed that we ate babies which we dont and that we make a compact to satan, which we dont since satan is CHRISTIAN CONCEPT, so save your money and dont buy this book, and my the god and goddess have mercy on these writers' lives"
2,Not Too Helpful,"I was a little disappointed with this book. When I bought it I thought it would be more of a collection of spells and charms. The most useful part of the book were a number of quick cure type charms which would only be helpful to a novice. Most of which, I now use other spells in place of. Many facts I even found false, and others were only half truths. Frankly, I learned more about true magick from talking to friends than from this book. It was only good for an entertaining read."
1,A false eulogy,"Brownfeld says that Shahak rejected ethnocentrism. But by going out of his way to single out and defame Judaism, I feel that Shahak encouraged ethnocentrism.The author says that Shahak opposed racism and oppression. But given his tendency to tell untruths about Judaism, I think Shahak practiced racism and oppression.It's fine that Shahak did not like Judaism. I'm a Pagan. I do not like monotheism. And that includes a dislike of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. But that is no reason to lie about them. And it certainly is no reason to incite people to mistreat each other.Brownfeld claims that Shahak told the truth and supported human rights. But Shahak did neither."
2,Ending is a Cheat,"Although the story was superficially entertaining and the characters seemingly real, the deus ex machina ending and the unexplained plot twists left me feeling cheated. As I was reading the story I was marvelling that the writer would be able to draw together so many disparate plot elements. As it turned out, he couldn't. That's the difference between a memorable book and one soon forgotten."
4,"lovely, fresh, and accessible","I was privileged to hear an advanced copy of the CD, Brothers, by Ken and Harry Watters. This album is a breath of freash air. It's new, it's contemporary, but it's imminently listenable. Ken and Harry's original compositions are wonderfully lyrical and exquisitely rendered. The freshly interpreted standards sound as new as the day they were written. Only siblings could have the kind of rapport the brothers Watters exhibit in their intimate improv dialogues. Although travelling different paths to arrive at this collaboration, trumpeter Ken and trombonist Harry share a common musical vision--a vision in which we can all share and celebrate."
2,Wasn't impressed,"Unfortunatly like so many, seen this was on Michael Jackson and jumped at having something else to watch on the great entertainer. Thankfully, I didn't pay much for it. Save your money, not a very good documentary at all or even interesting at all."
2,It broke.,I got this from eBay for a very cheap price and I don't think it was worth the $0.55 that I paid. All it is is a broken quarter with a rubber band around it. It is cheap and I would never recommend something like this.
2,Easy to break and not to conviencing,Mine broke after a few days...replaced the rubber band and it broke. Kids like it though so not a total lost.
1,Waste of $$,"Though this watch is very cute, it didn't work and I haven't had any luck with the manufacturer in fixing it!"
1,not serious,"As an atheist and graduate of a bible college, I was curious when confronted with the title ""new atheism"", but realized after reading the material that truly ""new"" only describes a reformulated definition by an apologist of atheism from his own perspective. If one wishes to use this book in debate, it will only work on the uninformed, for it only debates a creation of the author, not atheism itself."
5,Awsome!,"Even that I am not a core fan of anime, I could appreciate thebeauty and history of this series. The end is coming near, don't missthis 4 chapters!"
5,amo amas amat,"Hey did you ever see that movie where John Houseman is a choir director and he gets fed up and tells the choir they are a bunch of amateurs? Then they do a great performance and he regrets his former tone, and tells them the etymology of that word explaining the amateur does it for LOVE! Well yes Terre Roche sounds like an amateur on this CD, one with a voice and a nylon string guitar and a multitrack recording thing in her living room. This record just absolutely lays me out. The guitar is closely miked and the sound of that is very intimate. (Think of the way Glenn Gould's piano was miked--you could practically hear his knuckles moving.) The music is inventive and kind of rocks in a dervishy way. If the hand claps on ""Bearer of Bad News"" do not send you to bliss, then you are clay. Please also hear the refrain ""Bye bye"" on ""The Unrecovered One""!"
2,Hit & Miss,"it's one of those things that makes you go ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGThis darn thing is very snug, I had to struggle a bit to get the phone into it, the back flap opening is useless I cannot get the camera's cover to slide open not even when I unzip the case, it is extremely annoying.I don't understand what kind of designer came up with this I mean didn't they make prototypes?? the other openings seem to fit just right and a couple others seem to be off. if it were only 1/8"" deeper this would've been a 5 star item.it is attractive thoughARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGG"
4,A helpful sequel to the Tao of Love and Sex,"Following the Tao of Love and Sex, this book provides information for women on sharing Taoist sexual techniques with their partners. Also shares Taoist secret of nutrition and fitness as they relate to sex"
5,music for dreaming,"Wonderful music, makes you feel like your back in hawaii. I bought it so that I can add it to my Hawaian photos for my digital picture frame."
3,For the Keyboard Challenged,I ordered this book after using one similar to it at my sister's house during the holidays. It was good to brush up on my piano skills at an easier pace and I enjoyed reliving my experience of attending the play in London over the summer.
5,Great tool for weight management,"I love to cook, and do it well, and I am more than willing to cook something yummy for people I care for, but this book still came in handy for me, because what I use this book for is as a weight management tool. After reading some of the real but revolting recipes in this book, I definitely lost the urge to snack, therefore assuring that I did not exceed my Weight Watchers POINTS allotment for the day!"
1,The toaster has a mind of its own!,"I bought this toaster in February and since then, some days we have toast, some days we don't. Some days the buttons work, some days they don't. You get the idea."
4,Great toaster,"This toaster has performed as promised. I particularly like the wide slots so thick bread will fit and the extra lift you can get for shorter pieces that don't stick up out of the toaster. The signal beep is not offensive, although it has scared the cats who have come close at the wrong time. I would definitely recommend it, although you do need more space on your table or counter than for most other toasters."
4,New Toaster,Of course I needed to replace my toaster that died on me. This one has the features I was looking for and the price was right. So far it seems to be doing a good job.
5,The only review you'll need to read,These light bulbs are perfect. These lights came installed by our builder when we bought our home and they were hard to determine what brand and light bulb style they were just from the bulb itself but I'm glad I found them. Their shape and inner electric source (the light when on looks like a spider web which makes the room appear brighter) is great and hard to find with these types of bulbs. Wattage is reasonable enough to see in a bathroom vanity while getting ready in the early morning or nightime but not to bright to blind. Any lower wattage and it would be an unpleasant experience getting ready in a dim room. These are perfect. Great buy
1,Author definitely has a grudge against Clint,"I have to agree w/ 2 other reviewers on this board that basically stated that this author has a grudge against Clint. The tone of the book is very negative toward Clint and does not provide a balanced approach to his life. As a prior reviewer stated, the author would have us believe that all Clint movie-goers are idiots that wouldn't know a good movie if they saw one--nevermind that obviously, Clint has a huge fan base or his movies wouldn't have been so successful, nor would he be considered a Hollywood Icon. The author takes every chance possible to take a dig at Eastwood. I was very disappointed with the tone and negativity of the book. I did not think he did a good job at all in painting a real picture of Clint Eastwood. According to this author, Clint doesn't have a single good quality or trait. I find that impossible to believe."
4,Loved it when I was little.,I got this game as a gift for my Dad but unfortunately he hasn't been able to play it because it won't download on any of his computers. It's very disappointing. We loved it back when I was kid.
4,Fascinating slices of life,"I could not put this book down. Intricate relationships in this tiny village are revealed in a way that keeps the reader intrigued and wondering where the story will turn. It covers every aspect of the human condition in a humorous, sad, frightening, self-revealing kind of way. Not for the faint of heart. A great read."
3,I was expecting a bit more...,"...of what I am not sure. Going by the title one would expect maybe an action film with lot's of girls street-fighting each other but there's not really any of that here. It's more of a film about what happens to girls when they hang with the wrong crowd. Pimps, for instance. Girl Gang is a Category III film (that means R rated)with a fair amount of nudity & sex, cute women, simple plot, really annoying bad/tough guys and that's about it. If you love B-movies, especially Hong Kong B-movies (like I do) then give this one a try. However, if you don't then you better stay away from this one."
4,Nice and durable toy,"If your kid likes dinosaurs, this will be the perfect gift. The case contains several dinosaurs (different sizes) and plastic mountains, rocks and trees. My son did not care much for the mountains, rocks and trees, but there are more than enough dinosaurs to play with. They seem to be very durable. We only had trouble with one which would not stand up. This is a good toy at a good price."
3,"Nice dino set, but expensive for what it is","I was glad to purchase this for my kids, as they love dinosaurs. Overall this set has a nice variety of dino's to keep them entertained. The quality is what you'd expect - cheap plastic dinosaurs. I did notice a slight unpleasant smell, but I'm apparently the only one who does. One word of advice if you are thinking about purchasing this, be sure to check you local toy store. I found out a bit too late that a local chain had it for a much cheaper price."
5,Maureen Tan has taken this genre and made it her own!,"""A.K.A. Jane"" was the most exciting and definitely the best book in this genre... until ""Run Jane Run"" came along! This latest book from Maureen Tan is both gripping and believale, building on the strong foundation of ""a.k.a."", and yet also stands brillantly on it's own. My two final words : More Please!"
5,Run Jane Run,"For 10+ years I've read 2 or more books per week....the 2 ""Jane"" books are excellent! Characters are true to form & culture, the mystery is enthralling & has enough twists to maintain high interest but without the need to write down people etc in order to keep track. I fervently hope this woman writes more books!"
5,TV Ears Headset Replacement.,"My husband has used TV Ears for watching TV for several years now, and he watches a lot of TV now that he is retired. His old headset got broken and he was very upset. So, I found this replacement headset from ANTOnline through Amazon.com and within a few days he was back in business with his new headset. The service from this company was wonderful. Thank you ANTOnline."
4,Generally pleased with product,"This item works pretty much as advertised. It allows me to better hear dialogue on TV drama programs and movies. After long periods of wearing the device (1-2 hours) it becomes a bit uncomfortable, but a few minutes of rest alleviates that problem. (The discomfort diminishes as you become more accustomed to wearing the device.)"
1,tv ears are bad,"I have purchased 3 pairs of TV EARS all went bad in less than 4 months, I am very tired of purchasing something an I am very cautious how I handal them."
1,TV ears head set,"The TV Ears head set did not match the base I had. All I got was static. I had the original TV Ears base and broke the head set, so I just wanted the headset. Unfortunately I had to send the headset back and buy the entire TV Ears Unit."
1,compliant,The item did not work. I sent it back and asked for a replacement or credit. I was not notified of which step Dealsmania took.
3,Charging slow,Does not stay charged very long.older ears I have hold charge longer. Overnite charge only hold charge 2 hrs or so.thanks Jim
2,defective headset,"I bought a replacement headset at Amazon because Costco no longer carries them, but the sound quality was worse than my broken headset. I contacted TV Ears within a month of the purchase, and it took 3 calls to get them to be willing to replace the defective headset."
1,reception inferior to original,"With the original headset, I could sit anywhere in the room and get good reception. With the replacement, I must align myself precisely with the signal sender on top of the TV and not move my body while listening. Any change in position, any movement of my arms will cause interference and give me noise that overpowers the sound from the set. While it is true the replacement headset I bought here will produce an acceptable sound if I stand directly in front of the TV or find a position in the room that works, the necessity to remain absolutely motionless with my body in the exact attitude required makes the headset useless."
2,Extra Headset,"Can't rate this headset, had to send back. Not compatible with the extra charging dock for the 3.0 Digital Ears. Wish I had known this before purchasing. However had no trouble returning the product!"
2,Sounds good but uncomfortable,"Setup for me was easy, I connected the included Digital Audio Cable directly to my DVR cable box and was in business in a matter of minutes. Once the transmitter was pointed in the right direction, the sound coming out of the headsets was clear and the volume was more than adequate. I personally found the headset to be very uncomfortable, the foam inserts on the end of the headset did not help at all and the pressure of the headset became unbearable after a few minutes. Years ago I had purchased a transmitter and receiver that allowed you to plug in any headset you wanted, can no longer find the product but it was great!"
3,OK but flimsy.,"The only bad point is the charging system, very fiddly to get it to connect to the charging pins, I have 2 sets and both are the same way, design fault??? Also they are very flimsy, but at least I can hear the TV with them, before it was almostr like being at the silent movies, the actors just mumbled."
1,NOT first quality,"No disclosure in description, but these are 100% factory seconds. Interior appeared worn, soles inconsistent, polish smeared on stitching.Sent back with free return. Received very prompt refund."
3,ok to pass up Passup Point,Might have been better book if it hadn't jumped around with the characters. And definately would have been better without all the sex and affairs and living together. Not advised for Christians who believe in abstinence before marriage. But it was enough to hold your attention to find out what happened in the end.
5,incredibly useful,"The product qualty is great; many thanks to Anglers. The price extortion is not; muuch shame on Anglers. I've bought these for over 20 years now, and the price has escalated from 17 cents to almost a dollar (more than a dollar in most sites). Not worth THAT price anymore."
5,Perry Mason: Season 4,"This is just one more example of how good the Perry Mason series was, and still is! It has been a joy to watch the old episodes and enjoy them all over again. Also, reading the reviews of others has added to our understanding of the history of the show and its actors."
1,biodefender,product was out of stock - should not have listed if you don't hae the item & cannot get it.
4,Anemic and I use these,"I just found out I was anemic! And my doctor said to get these- never really tried any other iron pills before, but these are great and I feel 100% more like myself. :)"
5,works!!,Everyone in the family tested low on Iron. After a month on Slow Fe our Iron tested normal and it did not bother our stomach.
1,Sio Niacin,I have to admit that I took this without my doctor's knowledge and it didn't have a good effect on me since I was already taking Colesteral lowering drugs that were prescriped. I would not advise taking this if you are already on a precribed regiment and to always talk to your doctor first. It works well with a friend of mine who doesn't take precriped medication already. This is rated low ONLY because I didn't take it right and not because of the product. Remeber to always consult your doctor first!!
2,Hmmm,it's cute...small...kind of like a toy...weird that it's this small. Just one more item to keep on the kitchen counter.
1,Made me nauseous if I hadn't eaten,"I decided to try a new multi-vitamin, and got this one. Suddenly, while eating breakfast I would get nauseous and have to vomit. Usually, within 30 minutes I was back to myself. I was very concerned, until I realized it happened if I took the vitamin with my orange juice and didn't eat within a couple minutes. Even if I wait 15 minutes, its too long. I tried to keep taking them and only took them after I had eaten a bite or two, but finally threw them away because I couldn't handle the random vomiting. I've never had the problem with centrum or any of the other vitamins I take, or ever had morning nauseousness. It may not happen for everyone, but it gave me a few awful mornings."
4,^.^,"This is a sweet story (most of Lionni's stories are sweet, aren't they?) about a mouse and... well, yes, a wall : )She works hard to get over the wall, or around the wall, or through the wall... until finally she realizes she can go UNDER it, and she's hailed as a hero for ever.I don't know why Lionni's stories are so good, there's not much too them, but they... they last."
4,For the history paper writers out there...,"Eight articles from the experts focusing on the revolt of 1381 and related risings in late 14th century Europe. For primary documents, see R. B. Dobson's ""The Peasants' Revolt of 1381"". Warning: Although well written, not for the casual history reader.An Introduction by R.H.

4,Something New,This book actually had some nice ideas that I haven't thought of. Great pictures of every project and the directions were easy to follow. It's not too often I come across a book that has something new. I am pleased that I purchased it.
4,HALLOWEEN FUN,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY USEFUL & EASY TO CONJURE UP SOME HALLOWEEN FUN. IT SHOWS STEP TO STEP INSTRUCTIONS WITH PICTURES YOU CAN FOLLOW. I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THE PINATA, VERY EASY TO MAKE. IT RANGES FROM DECORATIONS TO FOOD & BEVERAGES. I LOVED IT, SUPER EASY."
4,Blue's Clues,The DVD is great but the old Blue's Clues DVD are better. Besides Blue the main character was Joe now it is a different person called Steve and he is not all that great. But the clues are fun for kids and my daughter loves to watch it. It is educational and funny. Also the DVD is very long so it is worse the money.
1,this is an illegal CD,"we fight against illegal merchandise, and this is one of them.Badly reproduced from the original records.whoever sells illegal records will be subject to a legal action.Please do not buy fraudulent merchandise.Thank you"
5,HATS OFF TO KIM CARNES FOR HER CONTRIBUTION TO THE 80'S,"Kim Carnes is a great singer/songwriter/producer and this compilation cd definitely proves it. From the smash hit ""Bette Davis Eyes"" to the danceable ""Invitation to Dance"" to the haunting ""Mistaken Identity"" this woman really knows how to entertain. Listening to this cd in my car on long rides evokes thoughts of my youth when Kim was hip and supercool during the early 80's. She sang with Tina Turner, and Rod Stewart live before millions of people, hawked Diet Coke,and was one of MTV's first video stars. In fact, she first showed the world the one handed sequined glove in her Bette Davis Eyes video years before Michael Jackson. If you want to relive a bit of your past, get this cd and enjoy!"
3,Chris Christensen brush,It is a good brush for a dog with a much thicker coat. I have a Papillon and it just runs through his hair accomplishing nothing.
5,Light Basics Cookbook,"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Martha Rose Shulman is a true genious. This cookbook is absolutely amazing. I have made almost every recipe in the book, and each one has been outstanding. They are easy to make, and her style and approach is easy and fun to follow. This is the way to eat, maintain a normal weight, and enjoy every bit of it, no pun intended. Thank you Martha!"
4,A touching final album,"June's final album is moving and bittersweet. While it is somewhat controversial amongst her fans- some find the roughness and waveriness in her voice disturbing- I find the renditions of some of her familiar material more sensitive than ever before and her final ""Angel Eyes"" always brings a tear to my eye."
5,a gift,"This late album/CD from June Christy is a special gift. Her voice even at its best wasn't completely secure. But my, they way she ""read"" a lyric. Here, with the group led by Lou Levey and including the ever ebullient (I saw him in L.A. performing this New Year's Eve) Jack Sheldon and a steller Frank Rossilino, Christy is really not looking back but singing in the very present. Her ""Willow"" is so wise and ""Everything Must Change"" is heartbreaking. I don't think any June Christy fan loves her for her vocalizing. We love her for her willingness to help us understand the power of song and singing. Geat sound recording."
1,"Worst coffee maker,,","After 2 months, the warming plate started peeling. Amazon replaced it. I've had this one less than a year and the same problem. The Teflon is peeling again. The coffee pot leaks. Now. I'm going to replace this unit on my own. I would never buy another Oster product again."
2,"Oster, how far you've fallen","Oster used to be synonymous with quality. But this machine is made by some Chinese company that uses the name Oster, not the Oster you think.The coffee is good, but of course that depends on what kind of coffee you use and how clean your water is. What stinks about this product is that the plastic lip around the coffee pot, to which the handle is connected, has come loose after just two months of use. We have to pour the coffee over the sink so we don't inundate the counter.It doesn't come with an instruction manual, no mention of a warranty, and their website is awful, with also no information on this model.Forget it."
5,Excellent,"Works like a charm; makes rich delicious coffee. Has increased my productivity 12%, and when the morning ""coffee ready"" alarm goes off the dogs know they will be fed soon, so they like it, too!NOTE: please don't give dogs hot coffee."
5,A Great Cup of Joe!,"You won't go wrong with this coffee maker. No ""water filters"" to worry about (and buy!); easy to operate; gives you an option of just how hot you want your coffee. Easy to clean hosuing unit (and good looking too!). For the price you can't go wrong...Enjoy!"
1,Died after 14 months,OVer the course of the last 14 months we used this coffee maker less than once per day. Heating element quit working two days ago.
4,good but not great,"The whole series is a must have for any comic fan. They did areally good job creating a new starting point with long time favorites. You get to see a lot of characters and the art is very good. I really hope they decide to put out the last season soon. I'm also looking toward to the new series wolverine and the x men, but I'll wait till the seasons arrive. I'm still a bigger fan of the original x men cartoon on fox and can't wait till it's out in a few weeks."
1,"New, improved handle ""au jus""","""Perfect"" my Aunt Fanny. Even a regular knife from a table setting will cut meat, and so will these. But the fancy ""no-stain, German steel"" doesn't mean squat if the things won't stay on the edge of your plate. Supposedly ""individually balanced,"" but every one of the eight steak knives my girlfriend bought for me is so well balanced that it inevitably slips off the rim and slides handle first into the food. The ""ergonomic design"" of the handle is meaningless if that same handle is always covered with sauce. Do not buy."
4,"Nice, but","Nice medal on the front, but has a smooth back and not the ""traditional"" back that's on an Immaculate Heart of Mary medal."
5,Oh Baby.,"Jsut thinking about this lead off track gets me all excites. I just wanna grab my girl and whispher in her ear, ""Baby...love is like a flower in the meadow...let me tell you sweet thins...come closer...let me look into you eyes...oh Jet Te Amor...""And yes.This is a great album for blasting out you window as your crusing down the street...Orangatang.That's all I gotta say.I've never heard the word pronounced so beautifully...Orang-A-Tang.I wonder what that song is about.Anyways.Pick it up.Serge is the uncle I never had."
3,Not for the faint hearted,"I truly believe that the Fanciulla recording made with Tebaldi, del Monaco, and MacNeil is one of the ten or twelve ""perfect"" recordings. This recording is not nearly in that league. It has its pleasures: Tebaldi never makes less than a lovely tone, Barioni has a nice sound without ever hinting at the excitement of the music. I love every note of this score, and will listen to this performance now and again, but the real standard set for the opera by Tebaldi's studio recording is barely hinted at here."
1,One Star is Generous,"Run, don't walk away from this set of flatware. You'll love its look and feel, but the first time out of the dishwasher, you'll realize the mistake you made in purchasing it: Rust everywhere. It's a shame, because we loved the design. But who wants rusty flatware? Answer: Absolutely no one. I'd give it half a star if I could."
3,Well organized but nothing new.,It's a well organized book but for me it just regurgitates what I've heard before and what I have already been suggested to do.
5,"Best, best, best!",This has changed our family...changed our life! I feel I have direction and a goal. It is the best book and could change our society if made a school book. Wish I learned this in my 20's...
5,Free from Brainwashing!,"It is amazing how the financial system bombards us with the debt is OK message.We as a society are convinced that it is not possible to live a quality life debt free.The system is always luring the debt incumbered to refi their homes, just use a credit card for immediate gratification and to live on home equity. Hello....you DO have to pay it back you know!!!! Even though they want you to believe that it just goes away! This book reinforced my belief in being debt free. I bucked the system....and my X husband lived buried in debt....thus...the main reason we are now ""X"". I have 2 young adult children and this book was a gift I bestowed upon them. Now...they are imbracing the principles and running with it. Lucky them....as youth and time is on their side. Share this knowledge...and reap the reward. This book changes lives and is contagious!"
5,Great read for everyone!,"This book was the best personal finance guide that I've read to date. I have the ""why syndrome"" and have to understand why before I will put anything in my life into practice. Dave Ramsey does a great job explaining things in laymans terms. He isn't afraid to set the expectation and explain all of the scenarios in each of the baby steps. His plan allows you to see quick results if you stick to it and larger results as you spend more time managing your money the right way. Dave doesn't pull any punches when explaining to best and worst of each financial options. This book presents a real guide to become wealthy. As with everything in life it will take some time and dedication to execute effectively. Get that gazelle intensity and you will make a huge difference in your financial well being and family life."
2,Messy and Over religious,"The concepts are all here, but this book is hard to read. As a finance professional I read a lot of personal finance books, and while I agree with many if Dave's steps his delivery made this one if the hardest reads I have had for a long time.It is repetitive ( and not in a good way). It is overtly religious. It is poorly written and in desperate need of a good editor.Other books on this subject are better written and easier to read. Seek them out."
3,Good Advice,"This book is filled with good advice about how to manage your personal finances, however, in my opinion I felt that some of the suggestions were a bit unrealistic. We've incorporated many of the tips but I don't feel it's the total answer."
2,Warning... Danger,"The financial projections in this book are way off and telling people they can expect a 12% return is irresponsible and dishonest for a book targeting people in need of financial relief. While some of the information in the book is good, the book has the word ""Total"" in the title. It is not called ""The Partially Correct, Somewhat Honest, Sparsely Accurate Money Makeover"". Dave is trying so hard to motivate his readers that he errs on the side of giving false hope. Again, certain parts of Dave's plan are good but if you were stranded in Iran and I had an 8 step plan to get you out, but the last 2 steps were erroneous... how ""out of Iran"" would you ever be? The book will get you half way there. Out of debt.If your investments have achieved a 12% annual ROR over a 15 year period--believe me... you're the one who needs to be writing a book."
4,Total money makeover,"I like this book, very practical application. A guide through Gods word. The testimonies are very reassuring. This book will change your financial goals."
4,Excellent approach for money management.,"This approach is an excellent way to help people organize their finances. The philosophy should be part of every high school curriculum. Perhaps the government should take a look at it, also. The only problem I felt was that too much time was spent on getting you ""on board"" and not enough was dedicated to the actual nitty-gritty of the program."
2,With a better author and a competent editor this book could have made a great pamphlet.,"This book is a lot like a hot dog, very little meat and a lot of filler. Riddled with testimonials from people who have used the plan. Re pleat with repetitious references to Dave's other products. I have no doubt that if you follow Dave's 7 baby steps you will be able to be a more financially sound person. I do doubt that those steps needed to buried in a 230 page book. When I finished the last page I wasn't even sure what all the steps were and what order they were supposed to go in. Try to find a list of the steps or a some sort of review, you won't find it. If he did that you'd realize how little actual information there is in this book. With a better author and a competent editor this book could have made a great pamphlet."
4,Works i Norway - too!!!,"If your problem is ""norwegian"" it also works. It`s all up to yourself and strict planning. Be FIT..."
5,The Total Money Makeover,"Critics of this book will point out things that mathematically do not make sense, such as stop contributing to retirement while working on your debt snowball. As Dave points out, winning with money is 80% behavior modification, 20% math. The key is to change how you behave with money, and if that means temporarily stopping retirement to focus every available penny towards debt then so be it. That will also help down the road to stay away from the temptations of borrowing money.As a recent college graduate in my early 20s, this is the most useful book I've read to set me on the right path. It has a simple step-by-step plan on what to do, and it's a good motivator."
5,Practical book guidebook with many illustrations,"A practical book for elementary students to grow up silkworms. Short history and life of silkworms was interesting. I bought this book because I liked the beautiful cover photo, but unfortunately, there are no photos inside. However comical illustration gives you good Idea about silkworms."
2,Athletic Training Student,"Although this book was relatively thorough, it was very boring to read. I dreaded having to read the thing even though the subject matter was interesting to me. The few pictures in the book were old and were not helpful. This book is not good for any type of visual learner. If you are a professor looking for a good text for an injury assessment class, keep looking!"
4,An Excellent Text,I purchased this book in order to do research for a novel I am currently working on. It was an excellent textbook. I can safely say it was a far more interesting read than the Georgia History text I read way back in high school. Charles Pierce Lewarne is informative without being dry and uses extensive imagery to transport students back in time. This book gave me jumping off places to enable me to continue my research. I would certainly reccomend this textbook for anyone wanting to research Washington history.
1,Sorry but terrible,The book cover looked promising but the story itself was quite a disappointment. I guess I was also expecting more of a Pirate romance based on the title. Except for the fact the leading man was a pirate there was not really a Pirate theme. The writer could have told the same story in about half the pages. I rarely skip pages but the story was so repetitive I just had to. I read the entire book thinking it would get better but even the ending was lame. I would not reccommend this book.
1,"DOA Does not work, also has a cloth band not rubber as shown","Received this item and it was dead. The strap is cloth with no dolphins, and I confirmed the model number and it was SV615-005. I requested a refund and ordered another Activa watch (different model), it was also dead. So, I decided to look at other Activa watches to see the reviews and many of them posted the same thing, dead on arrival. It is almost as though Activa is sending all the rejects to Amazon. Anyway, read the other reviews posted for Activa before you buy."
1,"Horrible product, only the wrapping is good","These must have been made a decade ago. the ""chocolate"" golf balls are a nasty off-white color (after you take off the wrapping) and the consistency of dry cocoa without any taste. Nasty product."
3,leaving your baggage at the door,"if you bring this on the plane or bus or train you have to check it is baggage this thing is huge for such a small device it's really a lot of room. Caring little purse around, but it does the job officially and will protect a Zune from any damage.(that's if your Zune works)"
5,I love it!,I just got the case and it is a bit bulky but has enought space to put everything inside. Wonderful for car trips!
2,Almost great.... but not sure what they were thinking,"The case is well made and has plenty of room for stuff. The compartment that holds the Zune is pretty secure, but they didn't leave a cut out for the headphone plug. If you want to listen to your Zune while it is in the case, you'll have to make some modifications. Look at the photo and you can see the cut out for the charger attachment...That's good, but guess what, the headphone plug is on the other side where there is no cut out and really not enough room for the plug even if there was a cutout. With this major design flaw, I can't rate it very highly even though the materials are very high quality and it certainly provides lots of protection."
1,Zune Gear Bag,Nice looking but the inside has no real value. No pictures or layout as to how to use the bag or how it was intended to be used. A waste of money since all the items necessary to use the box for travel wil not fit.
4,Gear Bag,"When I got my 120GB Zune I had to get something to store it in when I brought it into my car. I saw this and thought it was a great idea...it was! It's very sturdy, holds up to a lot, I love it. I wish there were straps on the other side too instead of just a net but that's just me I think :-) I love it!!!"
5,Holds a LOT of Gear!,"I bought this to hold my Zune and the myriad cords I use with it. It held those items and even a few other things! (I used it to carry some of my cellphone cords, too, and it handled all very well.) So, I love the gear bag. What I didn't love were the multiple e-mails from the seller seemingly demanding a review. That's not cool, even though I thoroughly understand why the seller wanted it. (I also sell online.)Delivery was super fast and the item is fabulous, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. The seller did his part by shipping it quickly and well-packaged. And although I was annoyed by the seller's many e-mails, it wouldn't be fair to judge the item based upon that. My advice is to be a much better buyer than I and rate the bag swiftly after you receive it; after all, that's the best way to do business online."
3,Zune Gear bag review,"I like my gear bag. It is a little bulky though. I also bought the docking station, but the gear bag is designed for the newer rectangular docking station. I have the circle docking station and it doesn't fit snugly. Over all I like it."
5,Zune Gear Bag rocks.,"It is well organized and quite roomy, though it resembles a shaving kit more than a case for a media player. It has a padded socket for the Zune with an elastic strap to hold it secure. It also has a custom fitted place for the earphone case and the AC adapter. The general use storage has plenty of room for the synch cable, remote, additional earphones and such.I recommend this item without reservation. It is one of the components in the Zune Travel Pack, and I encourage anyone interested in this item to conisider this excellent selection of accessories for the Zune instead of buying them individually, which can be pricy."
3,A Little Big and Cumbersome,I guess I underestimated the measurements because this case is considerable bigger than I thought. I was hoping for a smaller case that I could pack and carry in a small backpack. It's a little too big for that... It would be best for just putting it away in a drawer with all of the cables and extras in the same place.
4,Zune storage case,"I was looking around for a great case to put my zune in to take to work, i found this one, The case was sturdy, lots of compartments $ 29.99 was a little pricey, but it was worth the money."
2,Bike Service Guide,"Guide for specific category of motorcycles produced in the 60's. Guide is well written, offers clear photos and illustrations but ultimately was not particularly useful in offering me insights in maintaining a specific Honda motorcycle of that time period. Better resource found to be a detailed Shop Manual for my Honda S90."
1,Absolute Frustration,"PLEASE pay attention to the negative consumer reviews about this product before purchasing. When it works, it produces gorgeous HD video and sound. WHEN it works. But it absolutely will reject discs - even brand-new ones in pristine condition - on a regular basis. After one year of ownership, I'm getting a 50% success rate at best, which is inexcusible for a product in this price range. Please look elsewhere for your HD-capable player. I know I will."
1,Extremely disappointing!,"I agree with the previous negative reviews: a low-quality, poorly designed product... sluggish controls, useless remote, awkward interface and.... mine died after 6 months!"
1,VERY CRAPPY,"I bought one for $120 new. I was excited about this product as i just got a 46 inch toshiba hdtv. I hooked up the component cords as well as the hdmi. I Had 4 friends over and they couldnt tell between the hdmi 720p/1080i, or the 480p. They all looked almost the same. A bad thing i noticed about this was the picture was streached on wither upconversion mode, and that was crummy. I wouldnt buy this i would wait for HD-DVD, or better technology. Other things that were annoying1. slow remote speed!2. the disc's chattered, very annoying.3. remote is real poor design4. operates very hot, smelled like it was burning up, but it wasnt.i would stay away from this player"
2,Don't buy,"Takes too long to load the DVD. If there is even a small blemish on the DVD, it has trouble playing it. The remote is very limited."
1,Toronto guide,"My family and I visited Toronto this past Spring,and did not find this guide to be objective oreven helpful for our purposes.I would not recommend it to others.Thank you"
4,"good product, but better options exist.","This is a good product, but Amazon has better choices of Kodak 4x6"" photo paper available. I didn't look thoroughly enough before placing the order."
4,"Good, but 1:350,000 only gets you so far in terms of detail.","My wife and I used this in 2012 to navigate by bicycle from Dublin to Cork. It's pretty good. I would guess it has about 90% of the roads that we came across on it. The problem is, it is hard to tell sometimes if the road that you are at in reality is in that 90%, or if it is one of the 10% that has been omitted. There has also been a major motorway built in SSE Ireland -- presumably that is fixed in the new edition. So, this map is fairly good, but if you are trying to bike tour or otherwise are planning on being on many tiny roads, you might consider a higher-resolution map. On the other hand, we *did* made it with just this map and a bit of help from the Irish people (who treat a bicyclist with a map as a call to civic duty to give directions, and they are usually pretty good directions)."
5,Why are you reading this and not buying the album,"Mixing skater punks and hip hop has always been dangerous, but now they figured out a sense of timing; this spells certain doom for the rest of us. Astronautalis is the kind of rapper who steals the good off of every hip genre in town. Mix three parts indie rock, four parts hip hop, the fattest beats this side if the street, and you have almost come up with astronautalis's ingenius scheme of world domination through music. PS Desire not BotT"
3,"Good, but not one her best...Get ""Sugar Coated Love""........","...I was not disappointed-this CD is true, gritty Lou Ann style-and shows off her vocal style. Good Enough CD is just that-good enough. It sounded a lot like an Eagles album to me and when I looked a little closer-low and behold-it was produced by a former Eagle. I like the Eagles, but, the style if very different from traditional Lou Ann Barton sound. The CD sounded too watered down for me-this had most to do with the production/style than Lou Ann's vocals.."
5,This book has been an aid to me in my final year of college.,"This book by, Anna Mae Burke is an insightful tool for individuals such as my self who are perparing to enter the work force. The content of the book ""How To Choose A Career Now That You Are All Grown Up"" is very well written and at a level to were a high school student with basic reading skills would be able to understand. Anna gives you the 1,2,3 on how to choose a career and what to do to prepare yourself for career changes in your latter years. One of the elements that I found useful was the activities that she had at the end of each chapter that prepared you for the next chapter. In compairison to other books that I have read this book has granted me the most help in terms of overall information. Thank You, Samuel Casey"
1,HATED IT!!!,"Please save your money on this game!!!! It is the most stupidest game I ever played. Would have been good if you could use the mouse instead of the keyboard. What idiot came up with the concept of using the w, a, s, d(or whatever) keys instead of a mouse???"
3,Description not accurate,"It says ""humidity control"" but there is none - only air flow through the case. I bought the humidity package, but I think it only works with the Rico case. It's a great case if you were not looking for humidity, but then the price is outrageous for just that."
4,Great Alternative in the Study of Criminal Justice!,"This anthology offers a wide perspective of criminal justice issues by experts in the field. Unlike other criminal justice anthologies, this book offers a wide variety of views about how social justice and criminal justice work, or do not work together. Many of the articles contained in the book focus on criminal justice issues that are new phenomena in American society. Most of the issues presented within the book are a great addition to the long established criminological theories that have been taught to generations of criminology students. This book would make an interesting addition to anyone interested in studying the dynamics of current criminal justice issues."
1,"horrible, falls apart, red wing customer service rude","Boot seams began falling apart within months of purchase. My husband continued to wear them, all of the side seams have completely split within a year of purchase. Terrible deal, don't buy the Worx brand. I had no idea there was a Red Wing warranty until today, but when I called the customer service, the man was rude and abrupt, didn't seem to care that he sold a lousy product, and told me to ""take them to the store to ask for a discount"", even though the Red Wing website does not put any such disclaimer in their warranty, and also told me Worx doesn't have the same warranty, once again, not mentioned on the website warranty. Bascially, I can't find the warranty for the Worx line, only for Red Wing, and he refused to honor it."
4,Works fine for me,"I've been using this product for about a year to label discs and have been happy with it. I bought it new, and everything indicated was included in the box. Easy to use, lots of neat graphics."
2,The Frugal Gourmet on the Polish Kitchen,"Decent, but not fancy. His later effort in The Frugal Gourmet On our Immigrant Ancestors has much more authentic recipes. Still, the video demonstration of how to cook and fill pierogi will help those who have not seen these done. I tried the Pot Roast with Dill and found it to be very good. His recipe for the kielbasa filling is good, but later recipes are better. Bottom line: Look for videos from the Immigrant Ancestor series or get that book."
4,Battery Replacement,"Looking for a direct replacment battery for your home cordless phones, this is the place to get it and not go broke.I bought 3, charged them up and they are working fine.What a Deal.."
2,Don't waste your money,"This looked like a good idea and was just what I was looking for - an easy way to share my dial up connection without having to have both computers on all the time. Well, it does work, but not all that well. I had lots of dropped connections and redials. The dial on demand only worked sometimes. The DNS server was really flaky - I would have to reset the modem to get a connection back to one PC or the other. The firmware is the latest available, but has not been updated for quite some time. The only reason I put up with it was because I did not have a broadband connection available. Now I do - the modem will go on ebay for someone else to fiddle with now."
2,How Can You Learn Java With This?,"The book's back cover states (about the website) "" Threaded Discussion List - A forum for you and fellow students to discuss technical topics, WITH ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE FROM AN EXPERT MENTOR.""DON'T BELIEVE IT! The ""mentor"" rarely checks in. I had a straight forward question and still have not received an answer 3 days later. And I saw answers to other questions by students that were obviously wrong yet were not corrected by the ""mentor"". The Discussion List is full of msgs from upset students who were expecting SAMS to deliver what they promised. The msgs are simply ignored. And the book is full of typos and errors. Others have reviewed this book and said the same things so how can they rate it 4 stars? I highly recommend Just Java 2 by Peter van der Linden or Beginning Java 2 by Ivar Horton."
1,Download was BAD- -Video No Better,"Everything is said in my heading. This was one of the WORST downloads I have had from Amazon. The quality was grainey, the sound was out of sync and garbuled. Wasn't worth 5 cents, yet I was stupid enough to have spent 3 bucks on it.."
1,skip it,"I enjoy shorts, I've enjoyed most of the Boys Life and Boys Breifs series. These, however, weren't very good.Fruitcake, Tempting Fate, and Woof were especially bad, but not even laughably so. Investigation was an interesting concept. But over all, theses 4 were horribly written and acted.The others were ok, some even good.Overall, I'd skip it."
5,An eye-opener...and a good read,"I saw the author (Housman) interviewed on Fox TV and he made a lot of sense about statistics, polls, and misleading ads. I bought the book and wasn't disappointed. It should be the Bible for anyone who wants to understand information in the information explosioin."
3,Simplistic but thorough,"This is a decent resource for a review of what issues we (professionals and students alike) confront in today's schools. The material is appropriate for (senior) elementary through high school students. This book would serve as a terrific tool to use as an introduction to a group discussion of what can be done at your specific school to combat the threat of school violence. Definately a plus for teachers and school counselors. Its weakness is its last chapter, ""What you can do."" The suggestions presented are very simplistic and may be perceived as patronizing by older students-- especially those in very threatening environments. However, as mentioned before, this promotes discussion of what works and what doesn't, and is quite valuable in that regard."
2,Confusing,"The book does not serve its purpose as a general introduction to Mexican history because the author does not present a narrative history in any sense. Rather, the book contains a very high-level and abstract analysis of major economic and social forces surrounding the historical events, the basic outline of which the reader needs to know in advance. Perhaps the book would do better finding ""some resonance among fellow disciplinarians"" (from the Preface, p. xii) than appealing to the general (educated) reader."
3,A Bit too Predictable,"I really liked the strong beginning started out well and kept the pages turning, but midway through it seemed to lose its momento. It became transparent what was going to happen next. Was worth the read, but definitely not one I would reread a second time."
1,"3/3 1"" valves leaking","I bought the 3 valve manifold with the inline 1"" valves. I installed them and they leaked immediately. They seemed to be leaking from the top valve lid area as well as the solenoids. I took these valve assemblies off, wrapped all threaded areas with liberal amounts of teflon tape (it says 7-8 times around in the manual) and reinstalled them. Still leaked badly. Not a slow drip but rather steady so my box was always damp and full of water and black widows, etc..I will try to replace these with Toro valves as another reviewer had good luck with them.I spent $58.00 or so for the manifold and 3 valve inline kit at Home Depot-money wasted if you ask me.Do not buy, get something better quality, save money in the long run."
5,Great CD,"I can't believe how good this CD is after all of these years. It seems that the older some of these artists get, the better their music gets. I believe this is probably the best collection of songs David Gates has ever recorded and it's even better than his Bread years, I believe. One could only hope that he will release a new CD soon and we can hear his voice and talent once more. I ordered this CD after not hearing it for several years from a friend who had it and am greatly pleased by the songwriting and singing and the good recording. I'm hoping for another one soon."
3,Kitchen Utensils,"Thought this was Melissa and Doug, but it will be fine. The child is 2 yrs old we will order at a later day Melissa & Doug"
3,Bring back the Blue!!,"This is not really a review of the Pink version, since I don't plan to buy it. However, I do own the Blue version on cassette and was hoping to update my copy to CD. After listening to Amazon's sampling of the Pink version, I just want to add my voice to those that are unhappy with this reissue. Why? What happened to ""Moments in Love"" and ""Close to the Edit""? Why dump the superior Twang mix to ""Peter Gun""(which was one of my favorites)? Definitely recommend the original Blue over this one. I'm definitely holding out until I can snag a copy or until a superior Greatest Hits is released (maybe with the original ""Legs""?) Cheers!"
5,The best ever,"A friend of mine introduced me to the Art of Noise and I am glad they did. I found a blue copy of the tape (in a discount rack), and since I see how popular it is, I'm glad I picked it up! You don't know what you're missing. I plan on picking up the rest of their stuff."
3,BLUE COVER Much Better!,"I like this album but the BLUE COVER version is better. I have a copy of BLUE COVER version which actually has ""The Best of Art of Noise"" 12inch songs on it. Pink cover has all short versions and does not include Beat Box or Moments in Love."
4,"What, why!","Love the CD but I'm so disappointed about ""Beat Box"" & ""Moments in Love"" missing, which are two of my favorites and one of the main reasons I bought the CD. I didn't realize they were missing at first but just remembering when I had the ""blue"" tape that I had to sell in times of hardship. I hope I see it again someday. :("
4,The Rest of the Reviews Aren't Lyin',"The blue-cover version of this album *IS* in fact better, as it included such classics as ""Beat Box"", ""Moments in Love"" and ""Close (to the Edit)"". However, these songs were licensed from ZTT/Island, and I guess something went wrong. So on this re-release we get tracks from ""Below the Waste"" and ""FON Mixes"" to take their place. Not a bad collection, but not what it was."
3,"""Blue-cover"" version kick's more butt!!","The Art of Noise is one of the most creative groups ever. This greatest hits compilation is good, but the original ""blue cover"" version was far better. I have the cassette, which is almost worn out at ""Close to the Edit."" The updated ""Momments in Love"" is more seductive than the original version made on the first album ""Into Battle with the Art of Noise."" ""Beat Box"" is also slamming with the piano touches. I had the cd too, but gave it away (like an idiot!!) years ago. I desperately want the blue cover cd back!! This group needs to get back together!!"
2,game ...,"all right, lets not get too negative, but what can I say? the graphics are the only part of this game that is good. the levels are ludicrous in the fact that your allies turn on you. then there is a little thing i like to call a storyline, which this game lacks. bottom line, don't spent money on this junk."
5,Lemonada-the best Arabian Latin chillout album-ever!,"WOW! fantastic vibe, amazing compositions, authentic beats and richly textured soundscapes...i don't really understand the lyrics, but they seem to transcend translation..it's a great way to wind down and lose yourself on a beach somewhere between lebanon and brazil..highly recommended, a must have..."
2,Poor Fidelity,"Okay, I have hundreds of CDs and all of TJT's albums, but the fidelity is so bad on this effort that it is totally distracting! One reviewer likened ""Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat"" to a live concert - and that's what it sounds like! It's a shame because the writing is strong but the vocals are drowned out and there's little-to-no separation in the sound. Occasionally a poorly mixed album shows up on the radar (see OLP's latest album) but this is so bad it detracts from the overall integrity. Very disappointing!"
4,I'm just a shadow when you're not here to Shine,"R.I.P.The Juliana TheoryOne of the finest bands to hit the scene.Thank You for the music, the inspiration, and the love."
5,Excellent on Pork and Chicken,"My husband's co-worker gave him a bottle of this to try and he brought it home. At first, we didn't know what we were going to do with it and tried it on roast pork. It was love at first taste! We have given it away as Christmas presents we loved it so much and wanted everyone to know about it. The son says it is the BEST BBQ sauce ever and puts it on everything when he comes over."
1,"A waste of money to buy, a waste of time to read.","I have been an Elvis fan and collector since the fifties. I pride myself on my personal knowledge of and my extensive library on Elvis. If you want a book full of grossly erroneous information, this is it! There is no shortage of readily available data on every aspect of Elvis' life, but this ""author"" does not know how to do research and, clearly, was herself as ignorent on the subject of Elvis when she finished her book as she was when she started. A waste of money to buy and a waste of time to read! Useless as a reference book because it is full or major errors. I rate this book zero stars."
2,"Queen, Live in Budapest","Very disappointing audio quality with crackling and hissing in the background during the concert.The seller had another copy they previewed before mailing me a replacement and informed me the only clear audio was during the non musical footage. Poor enough that they chose not to send me a replacement, but to give me a refund.I'm surprised no one else commented on this. If better copies exist, I would love to own it.It's really too bad, as the camera work was excellent."
5,Wish there were more programs like these!,"As a teacher of second grade gifted children, I can recommend this software enthusiastically. It is both entertaining and educational and never seems to grow old or fail to capture my students' rapt attention. My students select this software more often than any other that I have. If only there were other titles in this series!"
4,Good and fast in operation,"The flash drive is fast in copying files and data. I had tried with big files, and it seems to be pretty fast and its unique design of gripping makes it easy to handle and install to a USB port."
5,"A clear, coherent account of Foucault's basis for the political","I used this text for some research I was doing on Foucault's accounts of critique, ethics, hermeneutics and aesthetics, and I found it to be the most comprehensive, and well articulated secondary source I was able to find on the topic. In this book, Simons eloquently provides the philosophical background necessary for understanding much of Foucault's work.I'm giving it the highest rating because Simmons does an excellent job of accomplishing what he sets out to do, and because it's a great companion for reading the primary text and, thus, will be very helpful to students, especially those just starting out with Foucault."
1,Not a gong.,The item you get is decorative at best. Doesn't have any kind of a gong sound at all. I suppose thats what it was met for but still...The book it comes with is funny.
4,Mini Gong,This was really a great gag gift for a friend it is small enough that it isn't a hassle to have it out on a desk or shelf. This ring to it isn't great but it is just a mini gong so what do we expect?
5,Loving It,"Being into fairytales and writing and illustrating for kids i thought it best to first do a study behind the tradition of fairytales. This text is a very interesting read and quite enjoyable, cause not only are there riveting discussions surrounding the very stories we grew hearing...but you are also given the experiences of reading different versions of them from centuries old and different cultures. I would recommend it!"
4,not what i expected,PERSONNA Magic Razor BP0700 its okay but i'm going to up grade.This is a great product to start off with shaving just be carefull with it kuz you can cut your self.Other then that its great tool for beginners.
1,Poor product!!!,The razor I received was useless the quality is shameful the buttons that supposed to hold the razor exsist on side and not on the other so there is no way the razor would be held in it's place what I've received was a junk.
5,"After 50 years, Kelly's project is comlpeted","A book first submitted by Ellsworth Kelly in 1951, it was not first published until 1999, to accompany another new book about Kelly- The Early Drawings. Kelly calls this book ""an alphabet plastic pictoral elements"", and in that he means expressing the very basic principles and elemnts of art- Line Form and Color, as said in the title. The book comes in two volumes- the first one- Kelly's simple designs cover each page with no text- except for the title and Kelly's 1951 letter, trying to get the book published. The second volume is a brief explination of his early work, including his first monochrome. I have never seen an art book so artistically created. The book dosen't give in to half-decent design- probably because it was designed by the artist himself. A great book for any art fan, and at very reasonable price."
3,The VIP'S,"Here is the first movie that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did after finishing ""Cleopatra"". The story is about several people on the same flight and complications brought about by a delay in the flight.The wonderful Maggie Smith and Rod Taylor are part of the cast along with Orson Welles, Margaret Rutherford and Louis Jordan. Combined with a beautiful Miklos Rosa score it is not a great movie but I still like to watch it."
2,$84 bucks??,For $84 no thanks. My non blu-ray extended versions look just fine upscaled on my Blu-ray player. Can't believe it would look that much better. In fact I've been pretty disappointed in many blu-ray releases of older movies. The upscaling of standard dvd's on many players really does look great(in my opinion).
5,NO SUPER DUPER LONG CUT,"THIS WILL BE A PERFECT BOX SET OF THESE MOVIES, MY GRIPE IS TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SUPER SUPER EXTENDED CUT WITH ALL THREE MOVIES COMBINED INTO ONE MOVIE. GROW UP AND STOP BEING A TOOL, JUST ENJOYTHESE CLASSICS FOR THE ALL TIME GREATEST TRILOGY EVER PRODUCED THEY ARE !!!"
2,What a ripoff...,"I bought this set even though I already own the trilogy in expanded form on DVD simply because i thought, given the massive size available to a blu-ray disc, that the movies would each be on one disc instead of two. No such luck. This set is little more than a glorified repackaging of the previous 3 boxed sets. Thank god I got it on sale for less than 50 bucks, or I'd be beyond furious."
5,AMAZING!,"I loved this Blu-ray collection! It was most definitely worth the money. I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES it, we watch it together and can't wait to buy a HDTV so we can watch it in its full potential!"
5,I Love Them!,"I won't go into all the technical details, or argue with anyone about the Blu-Ray rendition, etc. I am just very glad I bought this extended edition Blu-Ray set of LOTR. I already had the regular DVD set, and wasn't sure if this would be worth the extra money. It is! Worth every penny. If you're a LOTR fan like I am, I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase. I love the extra length, the sharpness, the color, everything...I honestly believe it's money well spent."
5,The ultimate,Watched it for the umteeenth time and with my my daughter who has seen it even more Blue Ray is as close to the big Cinema as you can get if I had a 60 plus screen it would probably match it
5,Amazing set!!! Beautiful!! Best Blu-Ray set I bought yet!,"The packaging and the overall quality of this product is amazing!! The picture is absolutely breathtaking. I love how green it is, how beautiful the sky is. This really is just remarkable. To all those who are complaining about more discs.....wow....its a freaking 4 hour movie. You can get up to change the disc. Hell take the time while you are up to get a drink or something. But really though. This is amazing. I am getting my gang together for a marathon right away!!!!!!!!!!"
1,SHOULD READ NEGATIVE 2 STARS,"THESE BLU-RAY EDITIONS FROM NEW LINE CINEMA ARE A JOKE. DO NOT BUY THEM. THEY ARE USELESS. EACH MOVIE OF THE TRILOGY IS ON 2 DISCS. THE SECOND DISC FROM EACH MOVIE IS FULL OF DEFECTS. POINTLESS TO HAVE ISSUED THESE TO THE PUBLIC. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED. THIS WAS OUR SECOND TRY AT GETTING MOVIES WE CAN WATCH. GONNA SEND THEM BACK FOR A REFUND. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON A REPLACEMENT OR EXCHANGE. SHAME ON AMAZON AND NEW LINE CINEMA FOR SELLING AN INFERIOR PRODUCT. SOMEBODY NEEDS THEIR TAIL KICKED. TWICE IN CASE YOU DIDN'T GET THEIR ATTENTION THE FIRST TIME."
2,All movies are 5 stars !!! No doubt !!! Why so many discs ????,It is absolutelly ridiculous to see 15 discs in this set !!!! I can not believe with today's tecnology we can not put all these features in a few blu-ray discs. Another rip off is the fact that most of the suplements are coming in a DVD format !!! I can NOT accept this no matter how great it sounds this set !!! You guys should see what Criterion Collection does much more for your money than this !!!
1,Missing a disc,"It took a while for us to work all the way through these discs. When we got to the end, we realized that we were missing a disc! Instead of the ""behind the scenes: return of the king"", we got two ""the passing of an age"" discs. I can't find any way to return it or anyone to contact to get a copy of the missing disc. Incredibly poor quality control for such an expensive item."
5,100% Awesome,"Great, lots of discs, but other than that, its awesome. Quality is great, and the case is beautiful. Tons of hours of bonus stuff too."
4,Great looking cover art photo.,The picture of the front the box set that is shown on Amazon is way better looking than the actual thing. The cover art is what convinced me to get this box set. But the actual cover is not as bright or shiny as the photo. Still a real nice display case.
5,LOTR. The Best.,I have all the LOTR Trilogy on DVD. I decided to buy the extended edition on BluRay. It's a whole new experience. The Resolution is very and the quality of the image and the experience of buying it on Amazon is even greater
5,AMAZING!!!!!!,I loved these movies before but now that they have the extended edition out its even better. They incorporated the new scenes perfectly plus added more action and surprisingly more comedy. It's a must for LOTR fans and movie collectors. One of the best looking Blu ray box's as well.
2,2 disks per movie,Why is there 2 disks per movie?!? I just start to get into the movie then BOOM!!! now i got to wait til i transfer in the second disk to continue watching. So dumb!!!!
3,Parts 1 and 2 Not Combined Onto A Single Disc,"Discovered that each film will be on two discs exactly like the extended DVD versions. I was expecting TFOTR, TTT, and TROTK to have Parts 1 and 2 on a single disc with the features on a separate disc. Unfortunatley, I am cancelling my pre-order because my husband hates having to remove disc 1 and insert disc 2 while watching these films."
3,LOTR Blu-Ray,"Nice package and nice extras. That being said, if you already own the DVD extended editions, a blu-ray player and an HDTV you will not miss much in video quality. I can't tell a difference between the two."
1,DVD not region free !!!,"It says: region free. Well, the Bluerays are but the tons of extras are printed on DVD and they air not region free but region A. That would have been the reason not to buy this product!!! But it didn`t say on the cover or the product details. And what would we call that?"
3,"Why ""Limited""?","Initially I was happy to finally see the extended version announced for Blu-ray. But then, given the track record of the of the studios' multiple releases for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I am nervous that they are using the word ""limited"" in the title [""The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (*Limited* Extended Edition + Digital Copy). Does the ""Limited"" label mean there are additional features they are withholding for yet another future version? Or perhaps it means this version will only be available for a short time??"
2,split over 2 discs is bs,"Is amazing to me that one of the best movie (series or alone) EVER in its extended form (the best!) is coming out on blue-ray; BUT, is being split over 2 discs. Please, is this really the best that can be done? To the loyal (and sometimes fanatical) LOR fan, this is total BS. Because yes, we love the extended version, and yes we will check out all the bells & whistles the extended sets come with just because. So why are we insulted by the 2 disc format? Major disappointment. MAJOR!"
1,Blu-ray should contain both versions,"Blu-ray version should contain both versions of the film, especially at the cost they are asking. One of the selling points of the Blu-ray format is the massive amount of storage each one can hold. STOP! giving in to corporate greed!"
5,THE BEST MOVIES IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the BEST version of the lord of the rings (movies.) When Aragorn sliced an orc in half, it felt like he was coming at me!! That's whats amazing about bluray. GET THIS VERSION!!!!!!!!"
5,15 disc set,"this is the worth 1 as only about $43.90story I don't want to comment as this popular in the world, but the video and sound I am satisfied."
5,Addressing Complainers and other Folk.....,"I have watched the FotR twice now to try and understand what people were talking about dealing with the supposed GREEN TINT issue. My (personal!) opinion (not referencing what Warner Bros. said about it being on purpose since this site is full of conspiracy theorists), the tint makes the film much richer and forboding of dark things to come. It adds the fantasy flare to the movie and really makes it look more like a moving piece of art then anything else I have ever seen in cinema.For all the complainers out there, I really have no idea why you can't appreciate the tint. It makes it feel so much more like middle earth is an entirely new planet."
2,ugh,"I hear they have changed the color timing of Fellowship of the Ring. It looks absolutely garish on my panasonic s30. It is not even remotely as watchable as on the regular extended version. While the sound is much better, the best way to watch the picture is with eyes firmly shut."
1,STOP reviewing an item that does not exist yet,"It's ridiculous that there are 70+ reviews for an item that is not for sale yet. Reviewing the movie is not the same as reviewing this specific edition of the movie released in this format.Ironically, I have to write a review to encourage people to stop."
2,Disappointed,"Ok, I mean, it looks fantastic, but seriously, they couldn't put each of the films on one disc a piece, they had to split each film into 2 discs? If I would have known about this then I wouldn't have gotten this set.It;s not the end of the world, but with these fancy blu-ray discs being able to hold so much data, you'd think they'd be able to fit the movies on one disc. ARRRRG"
5,It's a Traveshamockery that these haven't been released yet!,"Why is it that companies milk their consumers for all we're worth? Releasing the Theatrical versions on Bluray and not releasing the Extended versions, or even announcing their release date. They want us all to buy the theatrical editions, and then next year we'll have to buy them all over again! Don't be duped into their game! They are doing the same thing with Avatar! Good things come to those who wait."
4,Ultimate Edition?,"I will keep this short and sweet. The sound and picture quality are as good as you can possibly want. One complaint, and in my opinion it is a big one, the movies are still broken up onto two discs. With all the storage capacity of Blu-ray I should not have to change discs the same way as I did with the DVD version. That is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star rating."
1,The disc labeled as the part two of the return of the king was just another part one.,"Got it from the black friday lightening deal. I got what I paid for. There is only return option rather than exchange. So I'm keeping it. Shame on you Amazon, it's the last part of the trilogy."
5,Great movie,Extended edition was very worth my time. Love the fictional story. Will do marathon movie watching again in a few years.
5,great buy,"was a great price, great quality, great movie, would highly recommend to all people that like this genre of movies"
5,A 12 hour eye candy sugar rush,The extended movies themselves are wonderful in HD but the special features are just marvelous. This extended set has over 48 hours of great specials in addition to the movie. Binding and packaging are beautiful as well and look great on the mantel.
3,Why 2 Discs?,Just opened the box and was checking out the discs and I'm confused as to why they could not squeeze the extended versions of the discs onto one bluray?! This is annoying. It breaks the whole mood of the movie to have to change discs from part 1 to part 2. It almost defeats the purpose of upgrading them from DVD. Shame on me for not reading the description more carefully.
1,Not going to waste my money!!!!!!,I bought the movies when they first came out on DVD. I then bought the extended editions when they came out.Bluray should be more than capable to hold both versions of the movie plus extras.Not going to waste my money on these movies.Better luck next time.
4,Not completely what I was expecting,"As always the movies are great. The quality is amazing compared to watching on DVD. However, I was a bit disappointed to see that the bonus material was on DVD. Blu Ray's aren't exactly superbly expensive anymore. I'd figure that spending this much on a blu ray special edition would include all material on blu ray. That being said I still recommend I just won't give a full five stars."
5,The best there is.,"LOTR is the best franchise ever... this set is almost perfect, the only thing i can complain is the lack of Bonus features in HD. its all on dvd. A thing that will change with The Hobbit."
5,great movie,"I was very happy with the quality, the blue ray discs worked great, i bought it used. looked at some of the extended edition stuff as well, not bad.i think its worth it for the price, can't go wrong."
5,Love these movies,So much more content than any version I've seen. Brilliant color which amke the effects even greater that in the theater.
5,Truely an Epic for the Ages,"This is the definitive edition for any fan of Lord of the Rings. The extended versions look absolutely GORGEOUS in 1080p. I notice no green tint with the first movie, so I don't know what other people are complaining about."
5,excelent,I am a fan of Lord of the Rings and this pack exceeded my requirements and the offer was incredible. going to take me a while to see it completely.
4,The Lord of the Rings : Blu-ray - Extended Edition,The Blu-ray Extended Edition set is amazing for the price I paid with the clear perfect picture and sound quality and extras involved it was a no-brainer to purchase. Amazon came out on top when it came to pricing and shipping costs and in this economic environment that overshadows the rest.
5,Simply the best,"I read and loved the books. I watched the movies in standard and love them. And I watched them in Blu-Ray and love them. This is simply the best trilogy ever for fans of the fantasy genre. It kind of stinks that Hollywood chose to delay the Blu-Ray release but it is what it is. There isn't much else to say here. These movies are amazing. If you don't mind re-buying them (if you already own the DVDs) then it's worth it. If you don't own these movies at all, what are you waiting for? Pick up the Blu-Rays."
4,One Collection to Rule them All!!,"I love Lord of the Rings, and 15 discs, omg, You got a lot to watch!!! The presentation is awesome and the quality of image/video is super. Strongly recomended."
4,Elevacion between two worlds,"Rocca is definitely one of my favourite French Hip Hop singer. I have assisted to the development of French Hip Hop and Rocca and his Cliqua are master pieces in this history. This new release is certaintly extremely interesting for those who speak French with a fluency allowing them to follow Rocca's flow, quite fast. But even if the production is better on this record than in Entre deux Mondes, I am still stuck to the old records of La Cliqua. For those who would like to enter into the French Hip Hop culture, it's a good start, but clearly not enough. Pay attention to this scene, very interesting, and listen to great groups like I am, Assassin, Fabe, La Rumeur and Kabal. This way, imports won't be the old same way, from the States to the Old Continent. Bagheera"
1,long wait,19 days it took for me to get my order seller waited 12 day from when i ordered to ship it out and then got my address wrong had to contact ups an pick it up my self. i will not be getting any thing more from this seller.
2,I could put together something better than this,"I can not believe that for...I recieved a standard 3 ring binder with black & white, very obviously photocopied, pages that weren't even completely attached. There was also one plastic sleve, for holding samples I guess. I bought 5 of these for home warming gifts and I would be embarressed to give any of them out. They're being shipped back today. The concept is good, but the presentation is the cheapest I've ever seen."
2,How could someone screw up Tetris?,"We loved Tetris in all of its forms, especially the N64 version. However, this game was a BIG disappointment. No longer can you play head to head with someone until one of you builds up enough blocks to ""die"", instead you can only play as long as you want in story mode, which is one player. In the multiplayer mode, you can't play a long, involved game against someone. Instead, you play a game that has a time limit, and goals. This would be ok if you could turn the time limit on and off, and if you could manually adjust the goals. Since you can do neither, this [is bad].My fiance asked how could someone [mess] up Tetris, and this is the answer, this game. The N64 version is a much better game.This game is only good if you are someone who likes short little games in multiplayer. If you happened to like 45 minute challenges between people, then you're [out of luck]."
4,Tetris Worlds is more advanced than the original.,"If you liked the original Tetris, this is even more fun! Worlds has new Tetris-based games that challenge you even more. Colors that melt together, shapes that fall apart, and see if you can create a 4x4 square! Not as easy as it sounds :) I really enjoyed ""Hot-Line"". There are certain lines that are highlighted and the only way to advance levels is to create full lines on them. You can be a little more random with your placement to get to the lines because when you level up, all blocks on the board are turned into ""single"" blocks and gravity takes effect! It's hard to explain but like I said, if you like Tetris, buy Worlds!"
4,"Oh yes! More good music, but...","Music for anime is a really special niche in its own and, for me, can only add greatly to the series as a whole, or not. Stellvia's music is fantastic, great writing, powerful and thematic. The intro piece, ""Brilliant Road To Tomorrow"" is as masterful as it gets, alongside other anime themes, like Nadesico's, Kiddy Grade's, an oldie-but-goody like Lost Universe, and even Starship Operators, another Geneon production.For me, Im caught by what a series gives me at the start, its intro and music. The Stellvia Foundation, both story and music, are above par in every sense.I give it a ""4"" because these are only ""t.v sized""...they are truncated just as in the series, when they are really full length songs. I got this one simply to add to the collection and show my appreciation, but I'd suggest purchasing ""Sora no Koe"" by Angela, and get the full songs. They are quite worth it."
1,An awful tribute to such an amazing artist,"HOLD IT! Keep your hands OFF the credit card. This isdefinitely NOT worth the [money]. First off, if you're hoping you'll hear Shania's talent on this album, you're wrong. This album is merely a collection of the instrumental parts to her biggest hits. (Check out the song samples.) Although this album may be appropriate for the aspiring singer looking for some instrumental parts to upbeat songs to sing along with, the aspiring singer should be warned that the quality is way below professional...it hardly comes close. Professional musicians would be nice; the sound of many of the instruments seem to be computer generated. With so many songs out there that have been modified with the help of modern technology, I feel that this definitely should not add to the overwhelming amount that already exists. Plenty of talented musicians would be more than willing to help out.So, due to the simple reasons mentioned above, I feel that only one star should be called for."
4,"Lovely, touching, yet rockin","My first BR purchase was a delightful experience. I put it on my mp3 player and went for a road bike ride. From the first song I was hooked. Strong melody, harmony, and musicianship. If you dig mellow tunes that still rock you'll love this album."
4,Hopper-Fly 27mhz,The kids got this item for a Christmas present. They have had nothing but fun with this helicopter. They play with it about 3 times a week with no problem so far. Overall its great for the price. But what does one expect from a RC helicopter that costs less than $100.00. I was amazed at how well the kids can control this helicopter. I might buy another one so they can compete.
2,needs rotors and blades.,"Amazon in my mind could also be a supplier of spares ( rotors, blades etc. ) for the helicopters that they sell. It is a problem with rc 'copters."
4,The only reason this is four stars...,"is because it's pretty much an ARCADE version of Gran Turismo. Yup, almost exactly like it - with a few exceptions.1) As stated, it's more of an arcadish race game.2) As you earn money, you can purchase upgrades such as (in ADDITION to upgrades found in the GT series) front / rear spoilers, headlights, taxi sign, snow-skis, wings, etc...3) Upgrade specific races (in addition to those found in GT series) include a race just for cars with skis (entirely ice/snow), cars with floatation devices (a WATER RACE), cars with wings (who can glide farther).4) Shortcuts in some races which require use of wings/skis/etc.5) Drive a bus, dumptruck or other work-related vehicle.Who will like this game?1) Almost EVERYBODY that enjoys playing Gran Turismo will instantly love this game for a more relaxed playing experience.2) Anybody looking for a racing game that is new and unique, and still challenging.3) YOU!"
3,slow delivery,when I ordered my product I paid extra to have it shipped faster. but it didnt come on the days estimated. plus it took them awhile to send it after I ordered it.
4,making bread,"This was a gift for my Mom, who is 87. She has enjoyed it and makes bread several times a week. She has had no problems with the breadmaker since receiving it 3 weeks ago."
1,sunbeam 5891 2# programmable breadmaker,The appliance is bulky. The french bread I tried came out small and condensed.I should not have given away my old magic chef one that still worked very well after 8 years...Sorry I bought the sunbeam!
5,It's just as advertised,"Consumer Reports said it was good. Customers said it was good. And it is great!!! All of the other top rated bread makers were well above 100.00. This thing is fantastic and nearly half as expensive as the other top rated machines. We've used it four times since Christmas and we love it. It makes amazing bread and we're very happy with it. If you are looking to buy a bread maker, this is the one you want."
2,Stop Working after 15 Months' Performance,"Usually I used to use this machine one per a month for just kneading. Oneday its motor suddenly became too weak to knead a dough with abnomal noisy sound. Before being out of order, I was satisfied. Now I'm contacting the customer service."
3,it is good but shaking itself while working,"it is good to operate. simple menu. while the machine is working, it is shaking itself. like try to move itself from wherever it is :)))"
4,Better than Glades' air fresheners,"Nothing beats the smell of fresh bread baking and it's so much easier to do w/ this bread machine. I messed up the first loaf b/c I ended up putting in too much yeast (and was too lazy to start over), but the loaf still tasted very good. It was just a little sunken-in in the middle. I wish this model had a fruit/nut timer (so if you're making raisin bread or something, you know when to add the raisins), but I've still done okay w/o it. It's simple to use and simple to clean. Storage may be difficult but it would be w/ any kitchen appliance."
2,The Wrong Shape,"Reading all the reviews of this breadmaker made me think it would be the machine I wanted. I used my old bread machine at least every other day for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, when I got the Sunbeam, I discovered something you can only find out in person. The loaf pan is an odd shape. I can't see how you could use it to make bread for sandwiches. The slices of bread would be too large. Also, any bread I made in it wouldn't fit into my storage containers. The loaf pan seemed too narrow for horizontal loaves, but not narrow enough for vertical loaves. I think this would be a great bread machine if you're not trying to make all your everyday bread with it, like I do. I'm going to have to start all over looking for a new bread machine, one that will bake the right shaped loaves."
5,Great Bread Maker,Homemade bread is a childhood love of mine but I don't have the patience to make it myself. This bread maker is excellent to help me out! I love that I can choose the darkness of the loaf and I can delay the start time so it's nice and hot when I come home at the end of the day.
5,Second machine,"I love this machine! My family eats only homemade bread and I use this bread machine at least twice a week. I do not like the bread to be baked in the machine. Instead I use the dough cycle (1 1/2 hrs.) and then form rolls. My family of 7 devours them! I bought this machine about 4 years ago and it just now quit working. Considering how often I use it, I think it did pretty well! So now I am buying another one~"
3,Sunbeam Programmable review,"I purchased this machine because I have a wheat allergy, so I've attempted to make non0wheat recipes. Even after some experimentation on my own and using prepared recipes, I can't say I'm impressed with this machine's capabilities. The mixing blade does not do a sufficient job of mixing dry and wet ingredients. Often times, there will be dry flour baked on the top and that is using a recipe with a smaller amount of ingredients that the machine can handle. Also, the machine sometimes will not fully bake the bread leaving the inside a bit damp and doughy."
4,Sunbeam 5891 breadmachine,"I have never owned a bread machine. Researched many models and ask friends which they had used. I chose this one due to size, price and ease of use. It has proved to be a good choice. It is simple to use and easy to clean. I do think it should have come with more recipes to use. I am satisfied that I did not pay for a higher priced model when I am new at using bread machines. Our bread has turned out tasty and beautiful."
5,The Sunbeam 5891: Over-rated or a Real Performer?,After 5 loaves I can say the Sunbeam at less than $50 is superior to the $100 Breadman Ultimate which I used for years. Without question. Easier to use and it looks like a sturdier machine too. So far I'm completely satisfied.
4,it worked fine,Wasn't too hard to clean - did a good job of making bread. I didn't make very many loaves of bread in it but that's not its fault. If I needed to get another one I would buy it again.
3,Sunbeam breadmaker,I was disappointed in that it didn't respond when I pressed the buttons. Maybe I was doing it wrong but followed direction! I tried to use box breads and they turned out awful. The recipe in the book was fine.
2,Not Great !,"I would not recommend this bread maker. It is VERY noisy compared to my old one, and when it's kneading the bread, it vibrates so bad, you have to watch so it doesn't fall off the kitchen counter - I'm constantly moving it back to where I originally set it when I started making bread. It bakes the same as any other breadmaker but definitely is not a quality product."
3,Sunbeam Breadmaker,"Product does everything as advertised. The only complaint I have is with the mixing paddle. The paddle is impossible to remove, so the only way you can clean the pan is by soaking it forever to get the dough caught underneath the paddle out."
4,Love it!,This bread machine is very easy to use and makes great bread! I previously had the exact same machine but stopped working after 3 years of intensive work! I bought the same one again because I loved it!
5,Great first bread machine,"This is my first bread machine, and was a gift from my SO. I use it mostly for boxed mixes, and it works great, although the loaves I've made from scratch are great, too.The manual that comes with the machine isn't very helpful in teaching me what exactly the machine is doing, but I've got the gist of it. I had to replace the paddle about six months after I received the machine, because the nonstick coating came off, but they're under $5 here on Amazon, so it's not that bad.I'm vegan, so my breads have no dairy or eggs, and I've found this machine to work very well with ""veganized"" recipes.The jelly setting is awesome-- I haven't bought bread or jelly since buying this machine!"
5,Wonderful machine!!,"This is the first bread machine I have owned. I could never make bread or dough from scratch before, but with this machine I am now a pro. Simplicity at it's best!"
5,Great product,"I have really enjoyed this product since I received it a few weeks ago. I have made many different breads, and they have all turned out well. The price was very affordable and the results that I have had make this a great buy."
3,good breadmaker but,this was the first breadmaker I ever owned and the bread was very good especially when it came freshly baked and came out of the breadmaker. Didn't have a problem with most breads but the last time I tried making a loaf it must have shook badly because it fell off the counter and broke. I love the breads so I'll get another one but a different type model. I know it will cost me more.
2,"Good Machine, Broke after 1.5 years",Bakes good bread but broke after using for a year and a half. I've used it no more than 60 times during that timeframe.
2,Fallen loaves,"I'm so discouraged with even my favorite tried and true recipes for bread falling in the middle. I just tried the ""dough and then bake"" cycles, but even that didn't work well.I've worn out two other breadmakers and never had this problem before. I wish I had my old Dak back!"
4,I am happy so far,"This is my first bread machine. I bought it a month ago and have been making bread every 5 days or so since then. The whole process is super easy and fast. It bakes really nice bread. A few times, breads sometimes raise nicely and then fall a bit in the middle while baking. I haven't figured out yet why this happens with some recipes. Any ideas anyone? The machine is big, bigger than I thought, so I had to put it outside of my small kitchen. As other people, I had to buy a recipe book too because the manual is very simple. In any case, I would definitively recommend this machine, although I haven't tried others, because it works well, it is not expensive, and because I really like the smell of homemade bread."
4,Judicious purchase!,"I like to know what I eat...Since the melamine from china found in some industrial bread, I prefer to buy organic flour and do it myself!!! Beside this ""healthy"" aspect, the whole family enjoy my bread : french baguettes (I'm french, from Paris!), milk bread, chocolate brioches and so on... It is cheaper and better (with no oil, or corn syrup...) than the usual stuff in bakeries. One tip: I prefer to make the dough in this easy machine and then, cooked the bread with funny shapes in the oven.The Sunbeam machine is easy, and I am know used to prepare my bread in less than 10 minutes."
3,broke early,"I received this for father's day 2009. I bake 1-2 loaves of mostly rye bread a week, and my motor broke this week. The bread was usually good, if quite sensitive to the amount of yeast used."
5,Wonderful,This is the best bread machine ever!!! I've been making bread twice a week it's so easy and comes out so wonderful!! Would buy again!!
3,Great 2 months but then....,"First, I truly do love this bread maker. Unfortunately, I have only had the machine for almost 2 months and today, the bottom part that makes the paddle go around broke. It is not fixable and you cannot purchase a new pan...so what do you do? I will say that while it did work, it was a great machine. I would ask that Sunbeam and other companies that make bread makers also think about replacement parts. I spent around $60 and for it to last only two months - well that is not really a good deal."
1,Worst Ever - 1 star is too many,"I purchased this product after my Breadman Ultimate bit the dust. I got it at Wal-Mart and was very happy that I found a machine for 45$. I got it home and it quit working after 30 minutes of use. I unplugged it, started it over, tried everything I could (yes, even following directions to a ""t"") and it just kept stopping afer a few minutes. I wasted 6 cups of flour on this machine. At one point the machine stopped immediately after I hit the start button. It was terrible. I returned it and bought a new Breadman."
1,This sucks,This really sucks. I purchased it 9 months ago and the motor starts working last week!!! I rarely used it and it is not durable.
5,Bread maker,"I was a little concerned at first with this purchase, but it really is easy to use. You simply follow the very easy instructions, turn the thing on, and before you know it you've got fresh bread. The loaf size throws me off a bit, but you always have the option to mix the bread and put it into a regular loaf size pan. I've only tried the package bread so far, but I want to attempt the recipes in the book at some point."
1,Don't buy this product.,"I got this bread maker last month. First, it works good. We made pizza dough, and made bread couple times. I found our that it didn't mix ingredients well.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"
4,great breadmaker,This is a great breadmaker with lots of options. I have been pleasantly surprised with the jam. It comes with a number of good recipes too.
4,Great Video Game,We bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas because he is a huge Bob the Builder fan and it was on his wish list. He really seems to enjoy this and it keeps him occupied for long periods of time. He loves singing the Bob the Builder song that plays at the beginning. I think it's great for the young Bob the Builder fans.
1,More Mush From the Wimp(s),"This is typical liberal crap from the blame America first crowd that today makes up the democrat party. FDR and Harry Truman must be rolling in their graves.Read this to see for yourself and then read ""Unfit for Command"" to see the truth about John Kerry and his campaign."

3,worth the rental fee.,"there was not alot of the martial arts action scenes that one would expect to see from jeff wincott, but it was an interesting movie to watch."
2,FIXED this game!,"I looked everywhere on how to fix this game and couldnt find much help. I installed the game on my Windows 7..and did NOT change the compatibilty mode. What I did was, I opened the file location. From there, I clicked on Launcher. Then, a tiny box pops up. For screen resolution, select the correct size of your screen resolution (there's three options). I had to change mine to 800x600 (as that is the resolution my computer is set to. Then it will play! Simple.*About the game, I got too bored and dizzy from it to play anymore. It even seemed like more of a comedy game rather than a horror. Wouldn't recommend."
1,"Not a 500W PSU, and if failed after 8 months","I could only pull 390 watts from it when I tested it, but thats in the ballpark for lowend PSU's. You get what you pay for, and 380 'actual' Watts is plenty for all but dual video card gamers.However, mine failed after 8 months of intermittent use, taking out my new motherboard and also my old motherboard that I used as a backup (thought I overclocked my new board too far and fried it, but it was the PSU). Thats what I get for going cheap I guess."
2,"Good, but not great","I bought this pan to make a car cake for my son's second birthday. The instructions were useful in ensuring that the cake was cooked properly (be sure to check with a knife in the center of the cake to confirm that it is cooked through) and for removing it undamaged (lots of shortening and flour). However, the shape was just a generalization. I could have built a better car-shaped cake using a rectangular and square pan. The whole reason for purchasing this pan was to get the outlines of the headlights and other details on the cake and those things did not come through.Bottom line: save your money, buy a rectangle and a square shaped cake pan and you can use both multiple times."
5,These are our daily wipes,"We get them in sets of 4 - 6 per order. I use them with the Seventh generation diapers. Nice popup box. Not as thick or wet as traditional wipes (such as huggies), and I prefer the seventh generation.We purchase Amazon Prime so they come within 2 days."
5,Excellent for sensitive skin,"These wipes aren't as smooth or wet as mainstream name-brand wipes such as Huggies or Pampers, but they're an absolute MUST for babies with sensitive skin. My son reacted to all other brands of wipes with both rashes and screaming. Even Pampers Sensitive made him miserable.Not so with these wipes. We've been using Seventh Generation for over a year and a half, and my little guy's bottom is happy!"
2,Does not work on Flo-Tek body.,"You have to ream out a bigger hole for these to fit which is not a big deal if you have a reamer. But after I did this, I could not for the life of me get these to snap together. The Flo-Tek body's lexan must be too thick for these to work. I'm going to have to glue these in somehow because I've already reamed the holes in my brand new body. Shame because I like most of RPM's upgrades.UPDATE: After an hour of work, cutting myself, and scratching the heck out of my now bloody paint job, I managed to get them to work. I shaved off a small amount from the underside clip thereby giving a little more room for the post part to stick up. It still took an ungodly amount of force to get them to 'snap' together. Actually there was no snap, they just sort of sit there an hug each other. So I CA glued the heck out of them and hope that they'll hold."
3,Good concept but needs perfected,"These are a real pain to attach to your lexan or p/c body. Maybe easier on thinner material, but difficult on my Slash body. I glued mine in hopes they'll stay on. Good so far."
4,The Picture Book of Pine cone projects~ review,"The book was interesting to read. I was looking for perhaps a bit simpler projects, but the ones illustrated were great!Pam"
3,odetta,"I bought this cd based on the songs because my mother had a couple of odetta's records. I love the uncomplicated sound and the simplicity of the accompaniment.Some of the songs on this cd are like that but some that i remember have been jazzed up and while i am sure i will like them eventually, they were not what i was expecting.Still, i am glad to finally have a cd with some of the songs i recall from my childhood."
4,Been a while since I read Irving...,I enjoyed this book I guess because I love John Irving so much. Getting insight into his writing process and character developments was enlightening.
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Really, I don't see any greatness, width of scope or anything of the sort in these poems. I believe ""width of scope"" doesn't only mean addressing many subjects - it means how you address them as well. Granted, the poems are down-to-earth - and they do have a sort of quiet irony, if you wish - but that's it. There's no poetic spirit, none of that attempt to say everything (the beautiful as well as the ugly) in a deep and different way ... that attempt which, I believe, constitutes real poetry (and is perfectly compatible with wit or humor). I think this collection of poems has been praised far beyond its actual worth. Since I don't speak Polish, I can't comment on the translations, but what I see is that the voice, I mean the poetical voice, is lacking here. Sorry, but I haven't felt whatever it was that you guys found so inspiring."
3,simple descriptions....,"Mela's work is the first geographical description written in Latin. As a beginner for stduying historical geography, i'd expected more than real. It is very clear, but very simple. If you want to know about ancient geography, you must read other famous works such as works of Strabo, Pausanias, et. al. However, if you're an expert of it, this work will be a part of your knowledge."
5,Just follow instructions!,I followed the instructions carefully and even cut a bit of the tray that was over my gums. followed the times and i can see a difference already .. i left one for a touch up later but no pain and with some patience my teeth are a good color. will definitely buy again
2,Bring Back Rembrandt Dazzling White Kit!,"The results of this product are lackluster, at best. It's awkward to use and (worse) the outcome shows only a very moderate improvement.Rembrandt used to have a product called the Dazzling White kit. It consisted of four or five little tubes of a very, very effective whitening toothpaste. You just brushed your teeth as you normally would, using the Dazzling White. The only difference was that you didn't rinse your mouth for thirty minutes after brushing, giving the paste time to work. Results were excellent. I noticed a real change for the better in two weeks, and it lasted. No messy trays or fumbling with whitening strips.I'm not sure why Rembrandt discontinued Dazzling White, but it was a big mistake. Rembrandt, bring it back!"
3,It's Okay....,"Didn't get great results when I used them, but did whiten about 1-2 shades. The Rembrandt professional kit sold here on Amazon is a better buy and works better than this 2 hour kit."
2,OUCH!,"I have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest. HOWEVER, I was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow Advil. I used Sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help, but nothing seemed to work. The taste isn't bad and I used the bleach with my own trays that I had made by my dentist, so it didn't leak out or touch my gums. My teeth weren't sensitive while I was using it or even right afterwards, but later in the day. If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain."
4,Does what it says,I've used this product twice now and gotten good results both times. It will make your teeth much more sensitive than the treatments that last a week or more if you do the whole kit in 2 hours. I prefer to use the kit once a day for a week. Less sensitivity and I was still satisfied with the level of whitening. I also found the packages of whitening gel contained way more gel than my mouth needed. I was able to use 1 package for both trays effectively doubling the number of treatments. This cut down on the gel getting on my gums and hurting them & I didn't taste it so much this way!
1,Don't bother....,"If you want to whiten your teeth to any noticeable difference, pay a dentist to do it right. I didn't notice much or any difference after using this product. Big waste of money."
3,Whiten a little,"I'm doing this treatment now, and this is my second treatment. It's okay, I'm experiencing some sting in my tongue. I got this treatment from Walmart for less than $10 bucks. The trays only cover 4of my top teeth, and six on the bottom. I did see some whitening after my first treatment."
5,Awesome!,"Molding didn't take long although I used my keurig to get the hot water, everything else perfect! Love these! Didn't hurt my mouth or teeth. And a great difference at the end!"
2,"eh.. didnt work for me, but maybe for you","I picked up this item, with a whitening miracle in mind. i'd heard such good things, so i suppose my standards were set too high. but it was somewhat irritating to have the provided rubber trays in your mouth, because you couldn't really swallow too well, and the results weren't all that steller either. i had little white spots on my teeth, and other than that, i couldnt really tell any difference. not such a good buy, but according to the reviews, it did wonders for some people. for twenty bucks, you get tons of whitening gel (more than need to carry out instructions) and moldable trays which is a nice option if you have to deal with trays. hope this helps."
2,Don't bother with this product,"I purchased 2 of these whitening kits (1 for me and 1 for my boyfriend). After 2 hours of whitening our teeth we saw no results. It wasn't until the next day that you could see the results on my boyfriend's teeth, which he'd never whitened before. I would say that they were lightened 2 maybe 3 shades but not enough to justify using the product for 2 hours. I whiten my teeth once or twice a year and this product maybe whitened my teeth 1 shade. On top of that the whitening gel made both of our gums and teeth sensitive, my gums peeled for 3 days!Pros:Trays are comfortable and easy to moldif you have 2 hrs to spend whitening, it beats 2 weeks of 30 min applicationsCons:Not enough whitening results for using the whole kit.Gel causes more sensitivity than other whitening products I've tried.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone I like, nor would I purchase it again."
3,"Nice Teeth, Crap Gums","This product works. I didn't find it to be uncomfortable, and I liked the way it conformed to my mouth. (I just can't use white strips because they always slip off my teeth.) However, I ended up getting really painful chemical burns on my bottom gums. I'd say that if you're gonna use this, make sure to only use half a tube for the bottom tray and wipe your bottom gums clean after insertion."
1,"Not worth it. Painful, mediocre results.","I ignored all of the reviews that talked about blisters, etc. because frankly, people exaggerate a lot in Amazon reviews. I should have listened. I don't know if my mouth is more sensitive or what but ouch.Are my teeth whiter? A little, but not nearly as white as they are when I use Crest Whitestrips. My mouth is a mess. This stuff left me with burns that have blistered and really hurt. My teeth are very sensitive, but that happens with any whitening product because the dentin remains open for a bit after the treatment. The burns are unacceptable.In a nutshell, this product produced inferior whitening and painful sores. I don't even think it should be on the market. Obviously, I won't be repurchasing."
2,"Good Results, but OUCH!","Everyone is going to experience a different effect from any product, so this is just my opinion based on what happened to me.The results are pretty good. I was able to get rid of coffee and tea stains and make my smile brighter. My husband even noticed.The process itself didn't really hurt. There was some burning on my gums and tongue during the last half, I am sure that's because I didn't completely remove the access gel, even though I made sure to wipe my gums and mouth clean after applying.HOWEVER, 24 hours later I developed blisters on my gums and tongue and some tooth sensitivity. The sensitivity went away after another 24 hours. It is now 72 hours later and my mouth hurts more than it did yesterday.Although this product works, I am not sure it's worth the pain I am going through."
1,"not worth it, very painful","i started of doing the top of my teeth by the time i got to the 4th capsule my gums started burning!!! i had to spit it out and my gums got really swollen and red, and it didnt go away within a few hours! i def do not recomend this product, waste of money and painful =( , im going to the mall to bleACH my teeth instead =)"
