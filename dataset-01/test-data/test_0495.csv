3,Why?,"Ok, it works. It plays HD DVD's like it's supposed to and is a good price considering. But why didn't the 360 play HD DVD's with the built in drive? The games are 1080i, why can't it play movies like that too? This is like the original xbox when you had to buy an adapter and remote to play a dvd. Wake up Microsoft, these are more reasons why the playstation series is more popular.Fanboys for the xbox/360 like myself are grumbling all the way home from gamestop yet again. It's nice to have a HD DVD player, but I could have had one on the 360. This makes my xbox officially cost just as much as a PS3.So much for price being the saving grace, now it's up to exclusive game titles... and it's going to take more than just Halo 3."
2,Great HD but No upconversion for Standard Dvds,This is a great buy on a HD player but I would suggest just buying the Toshiba HD because you can upconvert the standard dvds on that one for 399.99. yes That is a steep price but at least you have the upconversion and your hd in one instead of going out and buying a new upconversion player with the 360 HD dvd. If upconverting to 1080i on standard is not what you want to do anyway then this is the way to go. I would have given this 5 stars if this could upconvert because the fan is much quieter than the toshiba and not big and bulky. very small.
5,amazingly low price for a great accessory,today i was searching for a xbox hd dvd shell and was hoping to find one around $20 i was amazed when i saw the whole thing on amazon for only $24! definitely one of my best buys off of this website. Thank You!
4,Great device for home theater set up.,"Alright, HD-DVD may be dead but if you're looking to jump on all the discs that are going to be on sale in the upcoming months, this is a nice route to go, especially for a home theater computer setup or if you already have the Xbox 360."
4,Great buy for $40.,"I bought this player for $40 from a 3rd party vendor on Amazon. I know all of the studios backed out of supporting HD DVD, but for $40, you get a great upconverting dvd player as well as the ability to play the HD DVD's available. There are a ton of sites and stores getting rid of their HD DVD's for a fraction of what Blu Ray movies are selling for.I watched King Kong on my 720p Samsung Plasma. Quality was excellent. Now I'm buying up HD DVD's when I can - Fry's has bins of them for $10 and under."
1,i got this!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this game a month ago and i was exited i played it and got so mad i threw it out the window and it broke i was then happy!
1,didn't like it one bit,Did not like this product takes to long to take a picture so the picture comes out fuzzy. Eats batterys like no tommorow Im returning this product cuase it didnt meet my requirments possibly better for a first timer camera.
5,great camera for a low price,I love my camera it was definitely a good buy. I had some troubles with the battery though. It didn't seem to me that the battery would stay charged very long. I bought an extra battery for backup and it works out great now!I found a battery for really cheap at needbattery.com's website. Click here to take you to their battery for this.[...]
4,great camera!!!,"I received the DX3900 camera for christmas and it is super nice. The pics are great using the high resolution setting (oh yea, it's 3.1 not 3.3 megapixels like the product description says!). The only complaints I have are first, the lcd screen is a little small, and two, the kodak software is a little slow even though the actual transfer using the USB is fast. If you have some other CF reader, I highly recommend using it. These are minor problems however. Now I just need a bigger CF card because of all the pictures I'm taking!!!!"
4,Excellent camera but...,"This is my first digital camera and I have to say I'm impressed so far. It's great for my wife, who isn't near the tech weenie I am. At the press of a button, she can charge the battery, download pictures, and initialize the memory card.My only complaint is with the battery (or so I think). I can charge the battery all night, put it in the camera, and the camera will not turn on. If I turn it off and on several times (when this happens), the camera will eventually turn on."
2,Not as good anymore..,"This is the chinese version of the ProCo Rat. The build quality is quite the same as previews versions. However the original RAT featured the LM308 chip which has been now replaced in this version of the RAT. Also, if you have seen some of the most recent versions of the American made RAT, the knobs and logo used to glow in the dark but that's not happening either anymore, of course, that's not big deal, but it used to be really handy because you can see your pedal better while playing in the dark. I found the sound to be a lot different from the vintage versions. I ended up selling this pedal on craigslist and upgraded to an older one for a few more bucks on Ebay."
1,Poor stuff,I will grant that this work covers a lot of ground and a considerable period of time but it is replete with error and bias.
2,A mish-mash of Balkan history,"Andr√© Gerolymatos is a professor at Simon Fraser University. How would he grade his own book? The facts are there - but... He seems to jump back and forth a thousand years in a single sentence. Not very helpful in understanding what happened, or what is happening... Professor, this is a C- job.For anyone wanting to understand the Balkans (at least Bosnia, and the effects of the Turkish rule in the ""former Yugoslav"" area) I would recommend, unfortunately, not this book but a Nobel Prize winning novel: ""Bridge on the Drina"" by Ivo Andric (Nobel Laureate for Literature, 1960, I believe)."
2,Disappointing because of false advertising,"Look at the cover of this DVD. What does it show? It shows three beautiful women, two of whom are vampires (who are, incidentally, about to dine on the girl in the middle).Why do I point this out? Because they don't show any GUYS on the box cover, yet once you watch this video there are guys everywhere! I feel I was falsely led to believe that this video is largely about lesbian vampires when in fact it's only that one scene. Whoever marketed this video realized that people don't want to see any guys so they wisely kept them off the box cover. Too bad the people who marketed this one didn't also produce it."
4,A collector's bonanza.,"Bear Family Records has done it again! The world's premier packager of oldies from the 1950-60's has taken the LIN/KLIFF masters and given collectors a bonanza. Here are valuable early releases by Ken Copeland, The Strikes, and The Chuck-a-Lucks whose later masters were leased to IMPERIAL Records; Buck Griffin, Andy Starr, Margee Robinson whose later masters were leased to MGM Records; Jerry Fuller, whose contract went to CHALLENGE and COLUMBIA Records; The Tu-Tones, The Atmospheres, The Mints, Steve Wright, Honee Welch, and Ray Ruff were all leased to LONDON/DECCA Records. These artists were innovators and producers of new sounds and songs in rockabilly, country, pop - you name it. ENJOY!"
4,Strange dark places,"Franciscan Hobbies float along, hinting at songs just out of your peripheral vision. When you turn your head to see them...they disappear. Like a humid summer daydream or an opiate nightmare. Relax and let the walls come unglued."
5,"Beautiful sounds of ""The River""","""The River"" is a heavenly selection of both sacred and traditional Americana music. From the sweet strains of Amazing Grace to the soothing melody of Shenandoah/The Water is Wide, the songs lift the spirit and refresh the soul. HarpSong has once again come up with a winner. My personal favorite was Look at the World, which featured vocals of both Grady's and Almquist's young children. This CD is a must have for anyone who loves the peaceful sounds of the flute and harp."
1,Seriously disappointing,"Entitled Guide to California and San Francisco, spends about 1 minute talking about San Fran. Jumps from one area of California to another, the video gives each place a cursory overview, lasting about one minute each. Amateurish and superficial; it's incredibly difficult to believe this video came out in 2005. It has the look and feel of a much older video, something I might have seen in school when I was young, and that was a very long time ago. Can you tell I was disappointed in this purchase? Planning a trip and this was totally useless. Sigh."
1,Terrible!!!!,"Ordered this film on Netflix. It's all footage from the 1980's, very poorly done. The $24.95 price is laughable. This DVD is appallingly bad."
3,It's tough to go back...,"While vasectomy may seem like a good idea at the time, warding off irresponsible, or trapping women and wives...often, life leads you to divorce, and eventually the desire to start a family again. After 2 failed (costly) vasovasectomies, we are still trying to decide why we made this decision. A wife with a history a ""accidental ""pregnancies was ultimately the cause and we will aspriate and continue to try to plan the first child in our family.Freeze it, bank it and be glad it's there when you finally find the right person."
2,A band with a multiple personality crisis,"Are they thrash or are they power metal? They don't know themselves. There must be two main songwriters here, one who likes to write thrash and the other power metal. Being a power metal fan myself, I find the thrash a bit hard to digest. Not because I hate it a priori, but because it clashed with the rest of the album. As Far As I Can Go is as good a power ballad as there is, and the vocalist is generally very good. But songs like Child Of Time should have remained in the can"
3,"Litanies and Other Prayers for the Revised Common Lectionary, Year C","This book is a good source for building Sunday services. Permission is granted up front for reprinting, provided the copyright notice is included. The only potential problem with the prayers is their length and profusion of words."
5,Outstanding Book -Embroidery on Paper,"This book has a wide variety of projects and themes to choose from.. an excellent example of the beauty that is able to be created with embroidery on paper.I would recommend most books by Erica Fortgens, and this one I recommend highly"
3,An ok commentary,"Part of the commentary is good, although I have found a lot of speculation without proof. In I Cor. 11 there is an assumption that there was a common meal before the Lord's Supper. All in all, it is a pretty good commentary"
3,Good Product!,It's smaller than the original one at the time of the purchase from Costco. Very well packaged and good product. It came with it's own lid and pouring cap.Only wish if Amazon prime would've offered it. Shipping cost is half of the cost of the product.
3,Nice jar but not the one shows in the photo.,"I purchased this item last week to replace the one my wife broke. After receiving this item, i realize this jar IS different than the one in the photo (that exactly what i had) the new one is bulkier and has much larger opening at the top so if you brake or loose the lid your previous or standard lid will not fit. But if you are using plasting jar right now then you will benefit from this. I am not happy because the one in the photo is much beautifull and easier to handle than the one i received.Update 12/03/2009:It appears seller finally changed the photo with the real one."
5,Great Book!!!,This is a wonderful book. I can't put it down. It has great detail and is easy to read. A great study tool.I love it.
1,NOT A MICK TAYLOR ALBUM: FALSE ADVERTISING,"DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD. IT IS A PURE RIP OFF AND ACTUALLY IS NOT A MICK TAYLOR RECORD. BESIDES, THE VOCALS AND ARRANGEMENTS ARE NAUSEATING."
4,"Great design, great feel, questionable steel quality","Ok- this will sound like steel snobbery. But remember, I own one too. This is ""high carbon steel"" of undesignated type (aka cheap). But I love the lines, design, and scales on the Freeman. I apparently missed the chance to own a Freeman with the better S30V steel (at least the drop point version). I have owned this Freeman for several years and it has done reasonably well with my game processing tasks, the only duty I have assigned it to. I cannot say that is has held a great edge, nor that I would trust my life on its strength.But it feels great in the hand, has served me well at a very reasonable price point, and I have no right to speak ill of its service. I have no regrets for this purchase. I do wish Gerber would get back into making more high-quality American tools and retreat a step from the import/gadget market."
2,Glorified Elevator Music,"Shallow, somewhat harmless, highly forgettable. Strictly for elevators, waiting rooms, cafeterias, and unemployment lines. I guess this stuff is good for people who have bought Star Wars - Braveheart soundtracks, or discounted Classical music compilations."
1,Worst narration ever!,"I normally thoroughly enjoy books by these authors. But the audio version of Deadly Housewives was terrible. While the stories could have been interesting, they were painful to listen to, especially those read by Henrietta Tiefenthaler. Why would they select a narrator who talks with a lisp? At first, I thought she was just trying to get into the character she was ""playing"" by slurring her speech as if stoned. But, that's apparently her normal narration voice. I've listened to thousands of audible books, and she is the worst narrator I've ever heard."
5,Granny Rocker,This game is SO much fun....for everyone! The price is just right & I would urge any trivia lover to purchase it. Thanks again Amazon. The game also came right on time. Once I get started I'm hooked for hours!!!
3,Dvorak heard through English ears,"I was attracted to this CD for the same reason as everyone else -- these are lusciously melodic works from a master of melody. I had hoped that Marriner's smaller-scale forces in the String Serenade would be an antidote to the symphonic approach of Karajan. This turned out to be so, and the strings of the Academy sound sweet and refined. Perhaps too refined, given the robust Czech style that works best in this music.The Wind Serenade is elegant to a fault. I couldn't help but think that we are hearing the music through the wrong ears. NOt that the English are always bland, but this reading couldn't be less robust. Despite David Hurqitz's enthusiastic recommendation (always a red flag), I agree with the other reviewer who gives this CD only three stars."
2,Disappointing,I honestly thought this book would be more interesting. The things in it were almost silly. Don't waste your time.
4,wow....what a surprise,"what we have here is four dudes from Long Island (?!!?) that (thankfully) sound nothing like the vomit-inducing, derivitive 'post-punk-emo-cr@p'80s sounding music that seems comes from that waste of a scene. This is harder AND more emotional...and needs no tags to prove it. Good for fans of smarter rock bands that still like to rawk. Equal parts beauty, groove and chaos (the end of Mr. Samuels just may be the sound of chemically unstable people playing a waltz from the depths of hades. as for the previous reviewer...the bravery of being out of range is a wonderful thing for sniveling cowards who are 100% unable to back up their displeasure with any sort of good solid reasoning. Sounds like a bitter, inferior musician to me. And I actually detected some of REM influence...just not the jangle. Not sure if it's intentional. A great debut."
2,This album is awesome,"Every song on this CD is great!!! Mr. Samuels brings you on a warped trip, through the sick mind of a suicidal teacher. Mood Organ makes me want to wake up and dial a smile. Adult Swim, Chemagrin and Unwelcome Pineapple are pure and simple great rock songs. Miss Velocity is ready the charts. Fountains is one of the best sounding songs I have ever heard recorded.The great thing about Another Engine is, not only are they great studio musicians, they are incredible live performers too. Check these guys out. You won't be sorry."
4,satisfied,grandson is enjoying the game very much. It is working very well and keeps him interested. Met all expectations.
3,"Fun, but Word of Caution","For beginner paintballers, my boys seem to like this pretty well. Word of caution to parents, the exclamation ""damn"" is used in the game. We play it without the volume."
4,great music and playing,"the music on this cd is pepe's best repertoire choices. he shines playing this music. not all of his interpretations are perfect, but he has a unique voice, which shows throughout the cd."
4,Great Book,It's easy to understand. It was actually my first Bible but then I gave it away and had to replace it. The devotions are relatable.
5,The NIV Womens devotional Bible,"The Womens NIV Devotional Bible is the best devotional bible that I have ever read. I sent one this year to a friend. It is easy to handle and has a soft cover. Weekending devotionals are very nice, and keep you wanting to come back to read more. The special authors for women throughout the bible lift and inspire for everyday reading. I am so thankful that I have the bible which has been a source of great joy for years now..and it's messages are tried true."
5,Uplifting and Inspiring,"This is simply a refreshing and inspiring addition to the Good Book itself. Designed specifically for women, the passages and devotionals will help guide you on even the darkest of days. Beautifully bound and conveniently thumb-indexed it is a bible you will treasure for many years to come. Complete with a reading plan, a weights and measures equivalency chart pertaining to biblical times and a list of devotionals arranged by topic, this bible makes the perfect gift for a beloved woman in your life or as a special treat for yourself. There is also a companion devotional book available entitled ""God's Word of Life from the NIV Womens Devotional Bible"". There is also a Men's and Mom's version available as well."
2,Poor,"I was really disappointed with this one. It was worth finishing, but just barely. Plastic characters, lots of convenience along the way, the ending is wrapped up quickly and easily. Predictably as well. I'd rate it 1 and one half stars if I could."
1,Contrived and clunky,"I read this book in the book because I was looking for a new thriller writer, but this one (whoever he is, Andrews is a pen name) rides like a car with unbalanced tires, reeling in unbelievable twists and turns. Sad that it was so contrived and the strings so visible, could have been a fun read in the hands of a better writer."
2,Not very original,"I picked up this book with alot of hope and was sadly disappointed. I am so tired of the same ole, ""I was cop of the year in the big city, but something horrible happened and I am hiding from my past in a little tiny never heard of town where no one knows about my past"" stories. It has been done and re-done and there is nothing left to add to it. It's dead and boring.The book had a good idea, it just didn't execute well. It was about all I could do to finish it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was it did intrique me enough to want to know how it ended, but not enough to recommend it to anyone I like."
4,Pilgrimage: A journey of the soul and mind,This is a monumental CD offering from 'Pilgrimage' called 9 Songs of Ecstasy. There is not one song that is not good. This is a new age song fest that is both ambient and haunting at the same time. This CD is best suited for listeners who are at home relaxing. Try this - close your eyes at the start of track 1 and relax and let the soothing rhythms take your soul and mind on a journal into a dreamscape of your own sub-conscious. The female vocalist who sings a romano-celtic tongue has a voice that is angelic.This album is a one only release from this artist but what a wonderful release. This is chant for those who want to relax and let their minds wonder in the playground of this rich and character driven music beat. The coverwork of this album is also a work of art and adds to the flavour of the overall album.
1,13 1/2 tsp of Yeast?,"I finally got around to trying this book from my collection. Evidently there seems to be a problem with some of the baking recipes. His Panettone recipe calls for 3 oz or 6 packages of active dry yeast. At 2 1/4 tsp per package this would equal 13 1/2 tsp of yeast, which is enough to make about 20+ loaves of bread. I checked four other recipes and they show the same problem, way too much yeast. Also the directions are confusing. You soak raisins in one cup of milk and then drain them. The recipe doesn't say to keep the drained milk or not. It turn out that you do need some of it. The ampunt remaining would depend on how dry and/or how large the raisins are. Also, the egg wash should have a little water in it and not be straight egg yolk. PS, The whole mess ended up in the trash."
2,Disappointing sequel to a great book,"I really liked 'The City who fought', so I was thrilled to find this sequel. However, despite meeting the likeable characters from the first book again, this one was a disappointment. It started well enough, but the end fell through completely. I felt cheated and even went back to see if I'd got a faulty copy with pages missing!The tension builds up, the characters are all in trouble, separated and discovered by the enemy and the next thing is that the heroine wakes up and all the action is OVER! A few loose ends are wrapped up (including the less than believable romance), but a lot more are left dangling. Maybe the author is planning a third book to the series, but I for sure won't pick that up."
2,Disappointed,"Reading this material made me feel like I was reading a channeling of HAL in 2001: Space Odyssey - very robotic. While I couldn't agree more with the concept of ""The Law of One,"" this material made it sound like a science text. If you're into reading about densities, colors, and the big, bad Orions over and over again, this material is for you. If not, try better cnanneled material from Barbara Marciniak/Pleiadians, Rasha/Oneness, King/P'taah, or Sanaya Roman/Orin.On a positive note, it was interesting to read about the Pyramids, Abe Lincoln, and Atlantis, but those were the few gems found."
1,poor quality,"this book fell apart in my hands as I attempted to read it! The backing (glue) was NG.I now have to replace it...an exellent read, worth replacing."
3,"Borrow the book, find it second hand - not worth buying!","Although this book is well written, the primary theme distuborsme. I understand how love can develop between two people, but as a responsible adult I can't condone adult-child relationships.I felt like I was reading NAMBLA material....This bothered me.Putting aside that issue, the evolution of the other characters was interesting. The conflict, or ""coming storm"" for each character resulted in something positive, with the exception of Tracy. He seems to be doing his penance at the end.This book is great for a discussion group, but also provides fuel to Jerry Falwell's fire :)"
1,Pedophilia chic,"This book is a modern tribute to the Prep-School novel e.g ""A Separate Peace"" etc. Only instead of powerful relationships between young men on the cusp of war, this author spins out a 90's teen sitcom. Pitch = Dead Poets Society plus My Own Private Idaho.It would be bad enough if Russell stuck to telling the story of an elicit sexual relationship between a student and his gay teacher. Scandal makes good prose. However, the author insists we should approve of these activities. In fact, it is possible to come away from this book thinking (as Dennis Drabelle from the Washington Post did)that the affair between teen and teacher a beneficial academic experience. Or as my friends from National Review put it: ""So there you have it: Pedophilia is good for your grades!"" When any culture (prep-schools included) removes strong negative sanction from purient sexual activity, it is the vulnerable who suffer, mostly women and children. I suppose this is a victory for sexual liberaation?"
5,Finest Work Yet,"""Set against the backdrop of a traditional boys' school in upstate New York, The Coming Storm is a delicately and brilliantly rendered tale that reveals the most closely held secrets of the human heart. Russell's award-winning novel is the story of four interlocking lives--Louis Tremper, the headmaster at the Forge School; his wife Claire; Tracey Parker, a 25-year old gay man and recently hired teacher at the Forge School; and Noah Lathrop III, a troubled student; all of whom struggle with their own inner demons, desires, and conflicted loyalties. When Tracey and Noah become involved in an illicit relationship, dark incidents from the school's past begin colliding with the current growing confusion that all of them must face. Compelling and poignant, this is the finest work yet from one of best contemporary American novelists.""-- zebraz"
2,Not Fine Tip,They are definitely not fine tipped. Id say they are about 1/2 and inch wide also the colors are drab and faded. They do erase well.
2,Title sounded promising; that was all,"I love sniping! In most shooting games, I tend to pick the sniper rifle, or anything to snipe people out.When I saw this title, I had to get it.When I started to play the first chapter, I had doubts that it'd be that great.The sound of the guns, even how they fired looked old and very dull.The graphics weren't even that sharp and impressive.It did at times, give me a sniper feeling, but the game ended so quickly.This just isn't a promising game."
3,WW2 Sniper,WWII Sniper was pretty good but the better sniper game is Sniper Elite.The graphics are more realistic and you will get your money's worth from the length of the game. There are easy modes on both games. No need for cheats. No cheat unlock anyhow for these games. Easy mode was test enough for me. I was over this game by the time it ended. I doubt I will play WW2 sniper again. Good hunting!
3,Has Some Worthwhile Moments and KILLER Bonus Tracks,"Here, Chick was faced with a dilemma, whether to make a blowing record like the first EB disc or play it safe and vie for more airplay. Unfortunately, the ""Play It Safe"" demon on Chick's shoulder had the final say, for the most part.Most of the set is more Fuzak-lite but despite that, some fangs begin to protrude on the feisty, funky ""Time Track"" (which was blowaway when played live), the lumbering ""The Dragon"" and the fiery ""View From The Outside"". It's not until the bonus tracks that you get real serious stuff, like the mysterious Arabic/Oriental flavored ""Hymn of The Heart"" (with some cool fretless bass work from John Patitucci), the raw ""Kaleidoscope"" and the high-tech ""Smokescreen"".If only the rest of the album was more like these bonus tracks!"
4,Good,"David Phelps is a very talented singer and his music captures your soul like no other. His dynamic presentation of a song is truly a work of art. The selection of songs was very good, but I did not care for the order in which they were shown, too much flipping back and forth in time. Great voice, great songs."
5,great,Anything by this artist is awesome!!!! I am amazed at the talent that God has given this man. I hope he continues to make mny more Dvd 's and cs's.
3,"Good Glass, Poor Bowie/Eno","If you expect to hear the melody of Bowie's rock masterpeice ""Heroes"" when you listen to the title track, then you'll be sorely disappointed. The Glass rendition offers no trace of the classic Bowie melody, though it is enjoyable Glass as always."
2,Just didn't do it for me.,"Heroes is a great Rock album to be played so loud that the dishes in the kitchen cabinets rattle. Making a symphonic piece out of it is ridiculous. ""Low Symphony"" is perfect. They should have left it there."
5,Nice work,"As other reviewers pointed out, this is indeed a nice work on Java Messaging. For the most part, the concepts are presented clearly and I had no trouble following them. What's good about this book is that there are enough examples to play with and most of them indeed work as promised in the book. This book uses ActiveMQ 2.1 for JMS Provider while the current version is 5.x. However, the ActiveMQ 2.1 libraries are included in the CD, so using those you will have no problem in running most of the examples. I could not get the examples that use Java Web Service Developer Pack (JWSDP) to work however (chapters 8 and 9). This book uses JWSDP 1.4 version which I could not find on the web (at the time of this writing only JWSDP 2.0 is available for download on Sun's site). The book says that JWSDP 1.4 is included on the CD but it was not. Except for these minor issues, this book is worth reading and owning. Highly recommended."
3,"A True Review, Not an Exposition","The purpose of a review is not to blurt the story and ruin it for the postential reader, but rather to interest, persuade and guide such a reader. Here is mine:The first book was obviously a smashing success. This second book presents some interesting issues. The descent of Nathaniel into the ambitious and corrupting world of wizardry is extremely interesting, and Bartimaeus himself is always entertaining. However, I found Kitty to be a drag. She is an interesting side character, yet I found her to be dense and sometimes strangely unnecessary to the overall story. I think this sequel is meant to lead into a much darker third book, perhaps where Nathaniel is one of the ""bad guys"" and Kitty would take the role of the normal, human overthrowers of the magical government. It'd be interesting to see how the author handles future skeins and storylines. Overall, I recommend the reader go back to the first, and then read this second."
3,Hello book 2,In this epic tale that any body would love a golem is attacking london and Nicholas gets sent to Prague.
4,Good Read for any Fantasy Lover,"The Bartimaeus Trilogy has a great voice--comical, cynical, realistic. Good read for anyone who likes fantasy. Has great examples of moral struggles with Bartimaeus--a demon who has no loyalty to anyone, but seems to have a conscience at times--but you don't have to head them if you are just looking for light entertainment.Highly recommend the read!"
4,Some Incorrect Grammar,"I love this book, and it's great and all, but I do find many sentences without periods. Otherwise, this is a great book and series! One of the best books I have ever read."
3,Dissapointing but has it's moments to shine,After reading the first book I could not wait for the second one to come out and boy was I dissapointed. The story drags on and on the story gose no where. I like the character Kitty's story it was intersting and fast paced full of tiwst and turns but Nathanal and Bartimaeus story was so boring. It wasent great but it was o.k I still cant wait to read the last book.
3,Hmm...,"Green Day's studio albums are amazing, but they are obviously NOWHERE NEAR one of the best Live Acts, as this CD/DVD combo shows. Also, most songs are the same."
3,Wake Up,"Listen, Green Day sold out and entered ""popularity"" when they left Lookout records(look it up youngsters) not with American Idiot. I stopped listening to them long, long ago but fondly remember there first two albums. With American Idiot I was shocked, all there promise was back and with a message. A great album to be sure. Now as for this disc: covering Operation Ivy's(argualby the most influential band on current ""punk"") ""Knowledge"" they screwed the pooch, awful. But for the rest of the show and the passion with which they play their new music I am a cynic slightly impressed. They sound tight and rich which is something they were never really known for. If you are a fan I am sure you will enjoy even more than I. But please guys don't think punk begins and ends with Green Day or blink-182 as most mention, start in the mid to late seventies in the UK and in New York, LA and trace it from there. I think you will enjoy the journey."
4,Quick Service,"Item was shipped standard and came before Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised that I received the album so soon. Item was received as described. Highly recommend. Would buy from seller again. The only problem was that some of the teeth (the plastic parts that hold the cd in place) were broken. This was because of the rough handling through shipping, it was not the seller's fault, the packaging was great."
1,One horrible band,Green Day in my opinion is HORRIBLE!Their music is way too bad for people of young ages to be listening to!Their music is definately not appropriete!Neither are their album titles!(Take this one:Bullet In A Bible...that would really make people of Bible religions really mad!)
1,Kill Green Day.,"Corporate egotistical financially-driven puerile juvenile idiotic sophomoric unintelligent wannabe intellectual punk-rock posers with not a shred of talent or dignity.""Hey, we're Green Day! We're famous! We released a crappy album! Now buy a CD packed full of live songs from that crappy album!""No, thanks. See, I'd rather take the bullet from the titular Bible, put it in a six-chamber revolver and play Russian Roulette -- with myself. There's a one in six chance. Please, God, please -- put me out of my misery. Let the bullet be mine. Let it enter my skull.Thank you, and amen.P.S. Somebody please put a hit out on Billie Joe ""Hobbit"" Armstrong and that utter tw@t of a bass player."
5,Texas Kathy,"I would recommend this book for anyone who is currently engaged in the spiritual retreat developed by Ignatius of Loyola. Whether you are a spiritual director or a retreatant, this book is easy to follow and comprehend."
4,Golden Girls season 2,Golden Girls Complete Second Season was a present and the person liked it very much. Package came on time to me.
5,As always - GREAT!,"The Golden Girls are hilarious, and this season was no exception! A must-buy for GG fans!"
5,DAZZELING,In her new DVD/album titled UP! Shania dazzels her audience yet again with her strong vocals. This DVD is well worth the $$$ in the entertainment you will receive.
5,UP! with SHANIA!,"It's been long waiting to see Shania in concert or for that matter any music from her. Her UP! CD is Fantistic. I just love her music. So I knew I had to buy the Live in Chicago DVD. I have been waiting to see her in concert for a long time, this way I get to watch it over and over with my kids. I think that this DVD is the next best thing to seeing her for real. Anyone that calls themselfs a Shania fan has to buy this DVD. It's awesome!"
4,Shania Rocks,She is so totally awesome in this DVD. I love her so much. I cannot stop watching this DVD because I love every song in it. I am so glad that she released it. The opening songs just totally rocks and takes you into her great live performance.
5,Shania Twain Is The Best,If your a Shania fan you'll want to add this dvd to your collection.Shania does a great job of connecting with her fans. I can't wait until I can go see Shania in concert. Shania's band is awesome. This is a fantastic dvd. From the first note to the last you'll love it. As a fan i know it will be the pride and joy of your collection that is if you collect Shania stuff.
5,On Everyone's Wish-List,"What could be better than rushing downstairs on Xmas morning and unwrapping your very own copy of Shania Twain's Up Live in Chicago DVD? This is the best gift anyone could hope to receive. So for those of you who have a Shania fan to shop for, don't disappoint, get them this DVD."
5,Shania Twain Up in Chicago,This a great DVD. Shania puts on great concert. I will always have to see in live. She is just the best. If you do not have this DVD you need to get it. She has all of her best songs on it and some of the new ones. Enjoy.
4,DVD of the year,"This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD does not know what they are missing!! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special so you are in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there is no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert! Shania definitely rocked this country the night of that concert!!"
4,Better than expected!,"My friend got me this DVD for some reason and I'm not a big Shania fan but after watching this one time through, I couldn't stop playing it! This is a MUST HAVE for ANYONE that calls themself a Shania fan! You will not be disappointed for Shania is incredible in concert!"
4,CELTIC ROCK,"If you like celtic music with a rock influence you will love this album. I know the whole band and they have played for me many times. If you ever can find their other cds GRAB EM!! All of the musicians in this band are very talented and have studied their selections in Ireland. This music ageless!! So grab this album, find a creamy pint o stout and get ready!!"
3,"Extremely useful, but bad battery life","I never had the bad programming experience that the others here seem to have had, but I also never had an especially complicated configuration. Lately it's just been TV (on dvd channel) + DVD player, TV (on PC channel), TV (on Wii channel). I the past also used it with a stereo system that bypassed the TV Audio. This remote was invaluable for creating an intuitive user interface.The biggest downside I experienced was that I had to change the 4 AAAs very often."
4,Very good remote,I found the Harmony to be very good product. The only problem I have found is that I use a projector and every time I switched from Watch TV to Watch a Movie it would turn off my projector so I had to make it think that I had a tv hooked up. Setting up this remote is a breeze.
5,112: The Best Male Vocal Group Around,"112 is the bomb and they are the best male vocal singing group around. way better than the wannabes JE. This CD is tight as hell. Q, Mike, Slim, & Daron have it going on. They the bomb. I Love all of their songs. This Cd is one of the best CDs i've ever heard. and i bet that every utha CD they come out wit is gonna be even better than the last. what else can i say, they is tight"
4,Battle Of The Planets on DVD Rocks!,"It sure is nice to finally get to see this series again after 23 years. Way to go Rhino Video!Image quality on this volume isnt as good as on the previous 2 volumes, this time there seems to bee more digital artifacts apparent due to the grain & noise. Still, considering the age of the material, I guess its better than nothing!Lets just hope Rhino Video have the balls to release the ENTIRE 85 episodes!! I'll buy them!! :]"
2,Nostalgia ain't what it used to be...,"I had great memories of this show from childhood, and years ago I swore I'd buy it if I ever got the chance. So I did, and now I know why most folks regard this as a terrible adaptation of the original Japanese series. My 3-year-old self apparently liked it; my 3-year-old son liked it; my adult self thought it was awful. My nostalgia fix is sated, but I wish I'd saved my time/money for something that wasn't crap."
5,brilliant music,"i get this beautyful cd by my brother and i have to say that im very impressed by it. the artists play turkish, kurdish and armenian folk music. the sound is just great, very good production! and every song on this cd is a masterpiece. just brilliant music."
5,More useful than the 3 R's. Except you need the first R to use it.,"I love this book. It's so easy to read, and puts things so simply. It gently pointed out the unrealistic expectations of others I had, simultaneously giving me the relief of knowing it's normal not to be able to provide perfection to my loved ones myself."
3,Far from his best,"This is an early McDevitt work, and it shows. It takes too long to determine who the main characters are and who's just a spear-carrying extra, the dialogue is a little stilted and artificial, and the ending is simple deus ex machina, and an an unconvincing one even for a DEM. Reading it wasn't a waste of time, but I'm sure glad it wasn't the first book of his I'd ever read. If it had been, I might never have picked up another."
3,No ending,The story is about finding ancient technology in the form of a portal to other worlds. The author makes no effort to explore these other worlds and leaves the reader wondering what happens in the end. I was like ancient archeology but I was disapointed with this book.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A couple of scientist types find something that should just not be there. In a ten thousand year old excavation they find a reasonably modern boat.How the hell did it get there, is the question. It leads to an even greater discovery, that of an alien structure that allows teleportation to far distant places."
1,Great first half and then rapid decent to disappointment,"Great idea and well written for the first half, but the book becomes a tedious mess at the end. In the end it was a huge disappointment."
3,"Great beginning and middle, but the end...","I was recommended this book by a friend and enjoyed it enough that I want to read some other works by Jack. Fantastic plot and believable characters. By the middle of the book it became a page turner. (Now here comes the spoiler)The problem with the book is: 1) left you wanting a lot, lot more. Talk about a major tease; 2) The climax to a building political and violent situation is a resolution that is totally cheezy and makes you feel ripped off. If it wasn't for these two things I would have given the book a 5 stars"
5,"""Rock Your Socks Off Review""","geez,where do i start,i bought this cd about a week ago and let me say this is the best compilation of artists i have ever bought in my life it's got everything you could ever want in a punk comp. i didn't understand why they sold it for only 6 bucks plus s&h on interpunk.com because it is worth WAY MORE than that!Anyways do yourself a favor and buy this great compilation the man who put this together is a great guy he owns mr good records an awesome record company in pennsylvania.Anyways this record is way more than five stars so buy it!"
2,Nice novelty.Nothing more or less.,"These days we are being bombarded with too many crossover,fusion and gimmicky type projects.This album fits that description,but all is not lost.We are talking about the music of Zeppelin,and their music would sound listenable played almost any way imaginable.""Kashmir"" is the gem of the album,and ""All my love"" is played with a tenderness that is ethereal.""Kulu Valley"" is indefinable.It sort of sounds like the primordial Earth as life is just beginning to ooze into being.Most of the songs come off as overly cinematic and whitewashed,which is about what can be expected from the London Symphony since they play and record so much of the dreck otherwise known as movie music.""When the levee breaks""doesn't work.""Friends"" is a mess.""Going to California""is flat out boring.Nothing is added to ""The battle of evermore"" played symphonically.Best advice? Buy this album only if you find it cheap."
4,Kashmir ordinary but Stairway sweet and Levee surprises.,"First of all, it is not the London Symphonic but the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The liner notes and art are interesting and reveal the new age/occult background of the arrangers. The music is good if not great. Kashmir disappoints, Puff Daddy does it better on the Godzilla soundtrack. Stairway to Heaven is sweet, good, hopeful, does anyone remember laughter? and captures the essence of the tune. The big surprise is When the Levee Breaks. I didn't think that an orchestra could pull it off, but they do in a remarkable way. Memphis Minnie would have been proud."
5,Excellent music all the way through,"I can't say enough about this soundtrack; sure, the Mission : Impossible theme only exists in 2 tracks of this 18 track, 52 minute CD, but the lack of it is fully compensated by everything else. This film score is an entertaining blend of excitement and craftiness, complete with a primary mood (in perfect sync with the movie) pursued in every track. I rate this as one of my favorites. As someone who's not very familiar with the original TV series, I enjoyed every minute of this soundtrack. The instrumental music is astounding - you''ll certainly be as impressed as I was."
3,Fun for a week,"""Santa"" brought this to my daughter (4 at the time) last Christmas. She played with it once or twice a day for about a week.The bar is big and awkward to store unless you take it apart. The video is kind of cheesy - although little ones may like that. If you can leave it out, I think the child would play with it more. An adult needs to set up the DVD but the child can set up the bar and mat.She doesn't want to get rid of it but hasn't wanted to play with it in quite some time either. I think it's definitely a toy for younger girls that are very new to ballet. Older girls would probably get bored and the bar may not be big enough for them."
2,Cheesy Ballet Video-not worth the $,"Our family got this for my daughter for her birthday after she wanted her cousin's at Christmas. The barre is neat but the rest of the kit could've been left out. The mat with foot positions is way too confusing for a young child. The video is very poorly done and does not really teach much about ballet. I'll stick with my 1970's video of children taking Royal Academy ballet exams. My daughter loves it and it isn't full of silly puppets, bad graphics, and poor ballet instruction.I wish I had the idea to do something like this. In the words of my mother, the makers of this video are ""laughing all the way to the bank!"""
3,Nice Product - OK Value,The chrome trim door handles (set of 4) are plastic.They look real nice on the car after placement.The product (I would think) cost only a few bucks.This item should be a 19.99 price point.
5,Brilliant!,"What a delight this book was! It really focused more on Dr. Trenton's alien encounter than on time travel mechanics. A quirky scientist, who had been prominent in time travel research when he disappeared 20 years ago, suddenly reappears and is placed in a government facility for treatment and evaluation. The book is written in interview form, as a psychiatrist tries to help him remember and recount what happened when he used his time machine. Through miscalculation and lack of understanding of the nature of time, he ended up stranded on a strange planet. This sounds silly, but somehow it is presented so well that it's almost believable. It is most certainly entertaining. This author is obviously highly imaginative and immensely creative. If you enjoy time travel stories, you'll find this one breaks the mold. I recommend it highly for those who enjoy an imaginary jaunt through both space and time, and who are not afraid to meet an alien who is not so alien once you get to know him!"
1,guru? perhaps. poet? I don't think so,I know they say that Sarasvati herself dances on the tongue of the enlightened one but hey this isn't very good poetry..makes me wonder about that Sarasvati thing. Better to pick up a copy of Rumi or Mary Oliver.
5,Really evens texture,"This stuff is great! Not sure if it is supposed to be used as a smoother for larger pores, but it seems to help fill in mine and makes my face look a lot smoother! Highly recomment it to everyone that needs a ""barrier""."
3,goku in other world,Opening ceremony first episodes is quite entertaing .As the episodes progress though it becomes a little dry.The last two episodes of the dvd are action packed but something is missing.Its worth purchasing to see the first episode though or if you like the senseless fighting of dbz.
3,"If you liked 'OASIS', you'll like this one","This is definetly in the vein of TaDream's recent 'soundtrack'works. Not at all like their most recent studio album, GOBLINS CLUB.It's not one of their best works; they're making a stab at Space Rock once again, and while the first track is pretty good, the album as a whole is very sluggish and lacking in compositional sophistication and structural integrity. It's as though TaDream's trying to make trip-hop without much HOP. At least they're sticking to the electronics this time and not segueing into cheesy new-age saxophones (it's good they gave that Linda Spa the old heave ho). Hopefully this does not signal an abandonment of the dance rhythms the group used recently and a subsequent return to the MIRAMAR-era new age duldrums that lost the band much of its core following in the early nineties. TaDream finally shed its New Age avez-dupoir a few albums ago; but it seems they're plumping up again with OASIS and now MARS POLARIS"
1,Incorrectly labelled tracks,The track listing on the CD with the new cover are the same as those listed by Amazon but the tracks themselves are mostly totally different.Someone screwed up. Was it Amazon or TD? Come on; own up.Maybe someone with the original CD with the old cover can chime in to set things straight.Anyone? Bueller?
1,Poor,This book is useless. The only thing you get is even more tests. There are only Dooo Doooo sounds on the cd and the answers on the book. Dont waste your money.
3,Bland...at best.,"I found exactly four recipes in the cookbook appealing. All of the other look bland. Very bland. It was a nice try though, and very animal friendly.PerhapsVegan with a Vengeance : Over 150 Delicious, Cheap, Animal-Free Recipes That Rockwould be a better pick. That book has tasty, innovative vegan recipes.Vegetable Love: A Book for Cooksis also another favorite vegetable book you could try.Good luck!"
1,CHEAP COMES EXPENSIVE!!!,Ugh! The movie has a good storyline but the quality of this particular DVD is below inferior. No wonder is so cheap!!! Ugh! Could hardly see the movie.
1,Very disappointing,"Very disappointing. Just a lot of repetitive non enlightening stuff like ""if the wind is from this direction pull in the spot and use the bow line first the stern line last"" basically repeat that phrase for the entire tape and you have this video M.O. They could have at least had the wind and current cause trouble when they said ""if the wind is strong"" rather it was just another repeat of the same tired boring movement. They could have had some tips about handling the boat in the open water or trailer techniques etc. Very disappointing. Maybe a total beginner that knows nothing but wants to know everything might like it."
5,Definitive Rendition...One of the Best Recordings Ever.,"....Previn's piano playing here flows and eases into Gershwin's famous piano concertos...unlike others I have listened to which were choppy and hard and attacking... I have listened to this ""Rhapsody in Blue"" for years and consider it to be one of the top ten best music recordings (of any kind), ever..."
5,For Reba Lovers!,This is a great item for Reba fans. It shows all videos that she has and takes you back to the earlier days also. Many videos shows do not show older ones and only show the new ones so this is a great item for the fans that enjoy the older videos also.
1,BORING FOR BOY AND GIRL,"I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO TO WATCH WITH MY BOYFRIEND. LET ME SUMMARIZE OUR RESPONSES: WE WATCHED, WE YAWNED AND WE WENT TO BED, NOT SHALL WE SAY 'ENERGIZED' LIKE THE INFAMOUS BUNNY. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY FOR A SUPPOSEDLY EROTIC VIDEO. AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR PLAYBOY."
3,"Decent review of heat transfer, however lots of errors","This book does a good job of covering all of the relevant concepts of heat transfer. I would give this 4 or 5 star rating, however the author makes mistakes in solving his own practice problems, but whats worse is the author can not even use values from his own tables correctly (for example in problem 4.3 the author uses a cp=473, when clearly in the table it is stated as cp=0.473). Errors like this are unacceptable, especially when many problems reference other problem. I have tried to reach the publisher to help correct these errors, but they have yet to get back to me."
5,heat transfer,"It is a very good book,I like the solved problem part of the book.I recommend it if your a beginner"
1,Terrible Advice,"I really believe that this book gives AWFUL advice and can ruin an expecting mothers views on parenting. Let me just say, that to those who are thinking of reading this as another one of those ""parenting advice books"" to prepare you for parenthood-DONT DO IT!! It will ruin your experience and harm your child. By letting your child cry alone just because you think they are trying to ""manipulate"" you is really ludacris...come on?!? I am sorry but if you get preganat ""just to buy stuff"" you have some major issues...why would you consider bringing a child into this world just for your own material gain? How selfish. Just avoid this book if you want to have a happy, successful, and loving parenting experience."
1,Dangerous advice inside,"This book has some of the most ridiculous and dangerous parenting ""advice"" I've ever seen. The author's take and ""advice"" on breastfeeding is nothing more than sad. Her language about breastfeeding is derogatory and her information about it is at best, misinformation. If you are self-absorbed and interested only in your own well-being and not that of your baby, then perhaps this books is for you. Being a parent isn't about doing the most convenient thing, it's about doing what's best for your baby - and apparently this author has missed out on that important life lesson. If you care about the health and well-being of your baby, you'll stay far, far away from this sad, sad book. Parents need support to do what's best for their children, not corroboration that it's ok to simply do what's easiest for the parent."
1,Appalling!,This book is an insult to any intelligent mother. You would have to be deviod of any emotion and lacking any maternal instincts to relate to this book. The fact that the author is a mother is frankly scary. . . we should want more for our children. If you follow the suggestions in this book you might as well relinquish the possibility of any meaningful bond with your child. The breastfeeding advice is absolutely abhorrent!
1,"inaccurate, self-serving information","The author is completely wrong when it comes to her statements about breastfeeding. She also is in favor of a 9-month-old crying it out, and claiming that babies who cry at that age are manipulative (even Dr. Ferber softened his view!) Again, what disturbed me the most was her inaccurate information about breastfeeding. Obviously, she chose to wean her babies at a very young age, and wanted to justify her decision. Instead, I recommend Dr. Sears's, ""The Breastfeeding Book"", ""So That's What They're For"" (Janet Tamaro), or ""The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"" for accurate, medically-sound information with regards to breastfeeding."
2,Yaaawwwn!,"I love brother Cadfael, but this one really was slow and I really found it boring. I lent the book to a friend and she did not want to finish it!"
2,neither essential or best,"While occationally interesting, Faheys best stuff was on Takoma, before he came to Vanguard. As of today, half of the best Takoma recordings are still unreleased on CD.Good cuts include ""the Yellow Princess"" ""Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt"" and ""When the Catfish is in Bloom"""
3,Unfortunately a bit disappointing,"I have a very good collection of DVDs centered on the Vatican, Rome, Pope John Paul II and many of them focus on the art and artistry of the city and of the Vatican. I found this particular DVD a bit disappointing. There was relatively no new information. The text was a bit heavy handed in the direction of Catholic dogma, rather than focusing on the art. The camera work was not as good as it could have been, nor was the lighting top notch. It simply could have been better in all arenas. Plus the DVD says it is 135 minutes long - that is not correct. The first DVD runs about 45 minutes and the second DVD on the Rosary runs about 25 minutes....The second DVD on the Rosary again is a bit heavy in dogma and doesn't portray the artwork in what could have been a thrilling manner. There are many other DVDs to choose from if you are interested in the art of Rome and the Vatican. The information on the DVD case itself also is a bit misleading."
1,Waste of Money!,"From the meager info provided by this website regarding this Vatican Library documentary, I decided to take a chance and purchase it, with the hope of using some of the images to visually enhance some of my art history lectures. (college classes)What a disappointment! This tape is far from an informative documentary. Rather than specific focus on individual artists, craftsmen, and their work, this is a sentimental overview of the ""glories"" of the various popes, complete with backround music of heavenly choirs. A Waste of time and money!"
5,Jaw-dropping underwater footage,"I was amazed at the quality and splendor of this DVD. It has some of the most incredible (some never before seen)fish and animals captured in beautiful detail. The ocean-diving birds, the sunfish being cleaned by sea-birds, the psychedelic creatures of the deep - amazing stuff!!!! Is excellent for children and adults."
4,Great water brush,"I haven't used it yet, but my wife did. She said it worked great, just as she expected it would."
4,goodwater,"This Nelson product works well for me. In this drought year the shutoff timer will be crucial. Also the adjustable coverage is an excellent feature and adjustemts are quick and easy.Since the device is entirely plastic, I fear for its longevity, but I'll get a good ROI, since I got it on sale."
3,Fun But Fragile,"I bought this pool for $ and it's true you get what you pay for. You absolutely need an air pump for this pool. Do not even think about blowing up all the individual pieces yourself! There are at least 12 separate blow holes. The water arc was fun but we never got it to stay up for any length of time. You have to blow it up to the point of bursting to get it stiff enough and even then it falls over frequently. We finally ditched it and used the pool without it. The ""slide"" got a hole in it after only a day so my kids ended up with just a pool with some extra diversions. There's no drain plug so to get the water out you have to step on the sides. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,useless within 24 hours,"Like the other review--this thing took 4 hours to inflate. When it was finally done, we filled it with water and my daughter started playing--she was having a ball, until the slide popped!! I found the hole, patched it, and we put away for the night. The next day when we went to use it, there were 2 more holes--this time in the sides. I patched those, filled with air again that night, and we were planning on using it today. Well, we cant, because there is ANOTHER hole in it and one of the sides is deflated. Dont wast your money on this thing!! We are going out pool shopping later today!"
2,not blocks,"There was only one ""BLOCK"" in the package, the rest were really just sticks. This wasn't made clear in the product description."
1,Sorafome,I do not like it it sucks man! Crape itCrape do not buy this protect please. It Sufis I am chopping it
5,Nutcracker on Ice,"Oksana's beauty and skating really captivated me. The music of Tchaikovsky is beautiful, and the cast of skaters provided a very pleasant program. I've watched my video several times."
5,steel toe sneakers,I have just recieved my shoes that I bought from amazon.com the're great comfortable shoes. I have bought many items from amazon.com and I've had a great shopping experience with amazon.com they have many things that most stores do not carry! I would recommend amazon.com to anyone!
3,ok,"these shoes are ok if you're moving around with them, like landscaping. However I found them to be very uncomfortable for factory work. If you stand on concrete for long hours, this is not the shoe for you."
5,Do yourself a favor and buy the 3 Disc import!,It's a shame the U.S. just doesn't get this band and therefore Century Media only releases the 2 CD set here and the 3 CD set in Europe. This is a live album that gives Maiden's 'Live After Death' a run for the money. Pure brilliance! Iced Earth is one of the few bands that sounds just as good or better live than they do in the studio. What really stands out on this set is the material from I.E.'s last album 'Something Wicked This Way Comes'. While I was a little disappointed in SWTWC as a studio album (especially after the brilliance of Dark Saga) when IE plays the same material live it rocks HARD! Buy the 3 CD import or you're cheating yourself!
2,A Brooke Shields Calender,"It is true,the quality of this 'DVD' is not great but it is watchable.I already had the movie on VHS and was very dissapointed to find the quality the same.The story itself is entertaining and for die hard Brooke fans this movie is a must.She is in a bikini or cut off denims and tank tops in virtually every scene which only emphasises just how gorgeous she was at the time.Its basically Brooke doing a swimsuit calender...with a few blokes and a crusty old man thrown in.Enjoy!"
3,great but....,So much about this CD is great--it is exactly what it says it is... the rain and crickets and everything are wonderful... but then the screaming monkeys start! (and they sound like crying babies!!--not so peaceful then!) They arent constant or anything--there is plenty of time inbetween screams for you to relax just enough to be startled again (or run to check on the baby) the next time the poor baby money cries for help.
1,"The Monkeys, The Monkeys...",I bought this trying to find a copy of a CD I had years ago that I couldn't recall the name of - I should have read the reviews. This almost is identical to the one I was looking for (rain with pan flute and harp) but the copy I had in the past didn't have all these screaming monkeys on it. Ruined the entire purchase for me immediately. I'll read more of the reviews in the future... This is NOT relaxing to me...
2,Plantronics Reniote Handset Lifter for CA10/CS10,"I am not as pleased with this product as I thought I would be. Although the lifter does lift the receiver, when I click the headset to answer, it always has a dial tone. Which defeats my purpose for purchase. I expected the lifter to open the line of the incoming call. I have 6 numbers on my phone and I stll have to physically depress the call-in line to answer it."
3,"Denise is annoying, but the moves work","I find Denise's voice to sound like a chain smoker, and she is just abarasive and overly peppy. I don't like that she's not actually DOING the moves with weights, but it's good that she actually moves around pointing out good form.The moves work. So that's what's important, but overall I hope there is a better arms workout out there because I can't stick with this based on Denise."
3,Just One Flaw,"I've had this leash for a couple of weeks now. It is wonderful except for one thing: it gets stuck once it reaches the end. The way it is designed, with the leash fabric doubled over at the point of attachment inside the handle, causes the end to become stuck if it is pulled out just hard enough. My 25 lb. dog manages to get this stuck very easily in a moment of excitement (which is often), so I have to be very careful not to let it out all the way if I choose to use it as a retractable leash."
1,This book is a thinly disguised advertising for realtors,"This book is a thinly disguised attempt to convince a seller that only a realtor has the ability to handle the transaction so that it goes smoothly and gets the best price.There is a ""should I sell my home myself checklist"" (ie: For Sale By Owner 'FSBO') that is cleverly worded to intimidate and discourage anyone from FSBO.Also, it practically glorifies the abilities of realtors and paints the whole process as extremely complex and it suggests to the seller to accept the most restrictive and lucrative contract that a realtor can get.Some may say that the information is good but given that it is embedded in such an intimidating and confidence reducing tone, I would reccomend you search for other books that, instead, explain the process clearly and completely in such a mannor that you feel confident in your understanding of it - regardless of whether you use a realtor or not...."
2,the Wright Brothers,"Very good book for students in upper elementary and sixth grade middle school. I chose it because STARBASE offered it as a literature scource for the attending schools. STARBASE in my area also offered a very nice curriculum guide to go along with the book.Easy to read, and very interesting biography."
4,"Great phone, should have come with a power adapter!",Overall this was a great phone with everything that I needed. The only problem is that it comes without a power adapter and that is very annoying since you have to wait another few days to use the phone once you realize there is no power adapter in the package!
1,Cheap clip is dangerous - my dog broke free!,"I had the same experience as the first reviewer - less than five minutes into the first walk my dog popped off the leash! She weighs 50 lbs and was not even pulling that hard when the clip gave way. We live in a city and she is not car savvy, so it was quite a heart-stopping moment. After getting her home safely, I tested the clip by attaching the collar and pulling it in the direction of the pin - it popped open and released the collar ring with very little pressure! I had this problem with another leash, but (naively) trusted this one because it was from a 'good' manufacturer - never again! This appears to be another cheap, untested 'made in China' product. I will never walk my dog without thoroughly testing a leash again and will probably go back to using a carabiner as an extra reinforcement on all my leash clips. The lesson: when it comes to buying any dog/leash or collar, BUYER BEWARE!"
2,UGH!,"Unfortunately, this entry into the chick lit and Red Dress Ink series is boring.The story of a girl who goes for her dream of becoming a singer is fine, but the narrative is so slow and boring that it just could not keep me interested.I would not recommend this one at all."
3,Outdated,"I was excited to find this because my husband likes uno and is a redsox fan. I don't pay enough attention to the game to notice the players. When it arrived he mentioned how it was out of date because some of the players on the cards are no longer red sox team members. I felt bad, but they of course are still usable. It would have been nice to know though when I bought it that that was the case."
5,A great discovery,"My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all. So I bought it, but I was a bit skeptical. I was amazed by the positive effects on my voice. And now Throat coat tea is one of the most important working tools."
1,This is not Foxes Book of Martyrs,"This is simply not accurate to Foxes Book Of Martyrs. If were simple converting the language from middle English to modern English, that would have been honorable. The foreward even indicates as much but instead it greatly removes content which is key to seeing Christ strengthen his people in time of persecution. In eliminating so much content the editor masks the underlying hatred there is toward those who loved Christ."
2,Subpar,"The idea for this book is a good one, but it was executed quite poorly. It's pretty much reading 329 pages of the same thing over and over. I think that Hyland could have accomplished what she set out to do in about 50 pages.If I were you, I probably wouldn't bother reading this one."
1,talking over the music,"When I watched this CD I immediately enjoyed the live performance being shown, then the editor/director started potting down the music with inane interviews played over it. What an insult to the music. Unfortunately tons of great live music is being interrupted by the same basic statements over and over. Why couldn't the interviews and history be told between the songs. Too bad."
3,It's just ok,This syrup need more flavor-it tasted like regular syrup with some pecan pieces thrown in. All the pieces of pecan float to the top and fall out on the first serving.
5,It's true,"I started taking this product when I was in very good shape to supplement my workouts. Since then I had a kid...and now that I am a little out of shape from the pregnancy, I started taking it again with my workouts and it works great. It is true though about having to keep taking it. Otherwise, it doesn't work well. But if you follow the directions and can handle a little caffeine rush, definitely try. This is much better than Hydroxycut that I took for a couple years...Now that supplement will make you feel sick."
1,Does it work?,I've been using this product for three weeks taking the recommended dosage.So far I haven't lost any weight.I'm dieting and doing mild exercise.Not too impressed.
5,the greatest suspense attempt in history,"This movie had it all. A great story. Great characters, and a focused plot. I loved this movie and watch it over and over again. This is one of the best 'B"" movies ever made and will hold a place in my hall of fame as being one of the greatest horror contributions in the 80's"
2,Leif Garrett and his Cheerleader Friends,"For all of the Leif Garrett fans out there, here is the fix you're looking for.I know you guys exist. I know that you're not satisfied with the countless re-runs of ""Where Are They Now"" you watched as a kid. I know you're hungry for more. Well here is a whole movie of Leif Garrett goodness for you to drool over.Cheerleader Camp is a campy horror movie about a psychologically disturbed cheerleader named Alison who goes to Cheerleader Camp with her cheerleader friends. One by one, her cheerleader friends suffer deaths that leave little to cheer over. But is Alison the killer? Or is someone playing a not so cheery trick on her by making her think that she`s losing her ever cheerless mind?What is the moral of this movie? A cheerleader Leif Garrett is better than no Leif Garrett at all."
3,it wasnt bad,"[...]this movie was not as bad as people say it is. Personally, i liked it although it could have been ALOT better if they took out the whole goten and trunks getting the living (crap) kicked out of them. the soundtrack was awsome.sound 4/5great sound, great sound effects, voice acting wasnt bad either.graphics 4/5same old dbz graphicsstory 2/5this is were it falls. so little is explained so u dont understand it."
2,Definitely a weaker DBZ flick.,"Movie 10, which featured the return of Broly, is definitely in the ""bad"" list. In it, Goten, Trunks, and Videl are searching for the Dragonballs. Eventually though, Broly(because at one point Goten cries and it awakens him) attacks, having landed on Earth. Gohan eventually joins in on the mix(Krillin too!), but Broly's too strong even for him and things don't look good as a result. It's going to take a miracle to defeat Broly. Personally, this film didn't really go anywhere. I lost interest about halfway through it. The ending is also quite stupid. It's a complete rip-off of the Cell saga ending. I suggest saving your money for a future DBZ film instead and passing on this one."
2,Missing characters,"This movie was half silly,childish and funny and the other half was action,but the action isnt really intense like in the show and other dbz movies.Besides that its not that bad its just needed more of the main characters.Its really for anyone who just wants to see dbz stuff."
1,Disappointing Performance,"After having listened to this rendition of the Magnificat several times, I cannot decide if the intent was to present music or simply to see how outrageously fast and mediocre a performance could be.Nothing is distinct in the vocal parts except the tempo which varies from blistering to warp 9.Inexcusable. If I attended a concert of this performance I would be tempted to ask for my money back. On the other hand I could not have dozed off and embarassed my date."
3,An aquired taste,You'd probably have to be born Italian or spend some time in Italy to enjoy this. Even the Chinese restaurants serve a small amount of this before a meal in Italy. It's not bad in small amounts.
1,gah,"This made me wish I was born without taste buds. It tastes sickeningly sweet at first and has an absolutely horrible, disgustingly bitter aftertaste. This tasted like it would be poisonous. If anyone has any suggestions about what this might actually be drinkable with, do let me know, because I have nine more of these things sitting in my refrigerator."
1,near to worthless in some places,"the ones we bght would not stcik to a tile shower wall, even when placed high and away from water and spray...we followed directions-yes.the adhesive is very iffy!"
3,Major plot hole!!,"Of course, the first one is always best. The second was alright. This one isn't bad either, just has a major plot hole. I think the difference between this book and book 1&2 is the action. This lacks ALOT of action that the previous books had. The real action didn't really start til the end. Anyway, this story takes place BEFORE book 2 in the timeline. This should have been book 2 instead. Bottom line, I only recommend this book if you're a HARDCORE AvP reader and curious to know what happened to Noguchi before Hunters Planet. But I warn you, you will be disappointed because of the MAJOR plothole."
5,Excellent and Fun Book,"This book is for any player who wants to add more melody to their lead playing. Players who are just learning to play single notes or intermediate players locked in the ""Pentatonic Strait Jacket"" will find plenty of answers here. Taught in a very musical format with jam tracks - it is really a learn by doing approach. I found the jams very easy to play over, kind of bluesy, swingy, roots rock groove with plenty of melodic licks.You'll be in the zone pretty quickly here.Very clear in its' approach, this book easily gets five-stars."
5,planets on psychology-- cool to death,"For a beginner, it's realy help to know the psychology meanings of the inner planets in Astrology. And it moves me a lot on the deeper of myself. For this reason i also order this series seimar,V1, V2,V3..on Amazon. so, order and read it right now."
3,Mindfulness out of control,"I have been a practitoner of Vipasanna for quite some time; I love Kabat-Zinn's work, but this volume was about 300 pages too long. His message is wonderful, but many chapters were redundant."
5,A Taste of Renaissance Italy,"Peter Elbling aka Ugo DiFonte offers the reader a merry chase through the castles and countryside of Renaissance Italy in the person of Ugo Di Fonte, a ducal foodtaster. The meals are sumptuous, though poor Ugo can't enjoy them because he's afraid of being poisoned. Ugo's daughter, Miranda, provides a romantic lead. Have fun!"
1,Angel of Light,"If you're unsaved then it is your best life now but if you're saved then it is your worst life now so don't be fooled by a false teacher selling spiritual paganism. 2 Corinthians 11:14 No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
4,M Lang is a ditz!,"Joel Osteen is a quality preacher and a pretty good author as well. Most of the reviews here are favoable. A few are not. It's so funny that all the people that don't want minsters of the Gospel to have money, are always striving to make as much for themselves as they can. We are to be ""Blessed to be a Blessing."" If you don't have, how can you give?Lost people are so stupid. I know, I used to be one of them.Jesus is LORD and all will bow. It can be either voluntarily, now and in this lifetime. Or before the White Throne. Where all the unbelievers are tossed into the Abyss. Like it or not, it's the TRUTH."
3,Life Path,"Joel's thoughts on living your best life and growing spiritually are on target but I'm not sure that this book is for everyone. The religous message may be over the top for some.The Life Path Journal is a religion neutral workbook that will also help you live your best life. Check it out now!Life Path Journal: Who are you, what do you want and how are you going to get there?"
3,Inspiring,"The product received in perfect, new shape. I like Joel and will give the cd's to my grandson, great motivational speaker for young person. More about goal setting."
1,Is it all about the money?,"I used to admire Joel Osteen mainly because my family watched him on TV and enjoyed his sermons....then as I grew in Christ I started asking ""Where is the substance? Where is the content?""I agree with another viewer. I think Joel just inherited this business (not ministry) and ran with it.If you are into ""feel-good"" preachers who don't preach Salvation through Christ, but tell how God wants to supposedly bless everyone financially, then this may be the thing for you."
5,"Glad to see the message of Love , Hope","Glad to see the message of Love, Hope and prosperity being spoken by a well meaning minister. Joel Osteen is a refreshing voice in the crowd of fear, hate and shame that too many christian preachers need to express. What he says is not new but it is being delivered in such a positive and understandable manner. If your looking for ways to change your life for the better, Pastor Osteen delivers. You should also checkout the books written by Neale Donald Walsch, ""Conversations With God"" series and his others for more of this uplifting message."
5,Excellent start to the new year!,Joel Osteen's book is a great resource for anyone trying to improve their life and get the most out of each day. I encourage you to read this wonderful book.
4,Your Best Life Now Book Critique,"The book was better in content, and focus than advertised! I had to read a segment, take time to process the content before proceeding to next topic... So much quality, deep-thought concepts... I would read other books by this author. Overall - Excellent, well worth time and money!"
5,Very Uplifting,"I am not a practicing christian nor do I attend any church. I've seen Joel Osteen on TV before and thought he was the most positive and plain speaking of all the preachers I've seen on TV. When I saw he had this book coming out I figured I'd check it out at the library to see if it was any good. This book was very good, very uplifting, motivating and all that good stuff. The main recurring message seems to be ""change your thoughts, change you life"". It reminds me a lot of Norman Vincent Peale's ""the power of positive thinking"" I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with everyday life or anyone who just needs understanding in plain english.Very enjoyable to read."
1,Christian Humanism,"First of all I would like to know how so many Christians today are blind to the fact that books like this are merely a form of humanism masked in Christianity. As Christians we need to think twice about what it means to be succesful. Secondly, we better wake up and analyze this shallow Christianity, God's purpose for us is for ""Christ to be formed in us."" I would like to see the Osteen types preach to the underground church in China or the hundreds of Christian martyrs throughout the centuries. The man would be rebuked and ostracized as a false prophet."
3,Was Not Like New,IT was described as like New. Binder was almost broken on it and some pages wrinkled up. If I knew it would have been like this I would have purchased a new one for a few dollars more.
1,"Thanks, but no thanks. Give me Christ crucified.","Just platitudes and self-help moralism. In over 300 pages, I found one reference to Christ crucifed. It was on page 71 and it included no discussion whatever of the meaning of the death of Christ for sinners, only that the cross was made of olive wood. How can a ""Christian"" book not even mention Christ's substitutionary atonement in an eleven page chapter on forgiveness?How can multiple chapters on feeling good about yourself not even hint at the doctrine of justification? The reviewers who love this book don't even understand why this upsets me or what I am writing about, and that is truly sad. St.Paul wrote ""for I was determined to know nothing among you but Christ crucified."" Joel Osteen's approach seems to be ""for I am determined to proclaim anything but Christ crucified."" Over two millenia, millions have been martyred for the cause of Christ. Question: Would anyone be willing to die defending the message of this book?"
4,Very very uplifting! Encouraging & spirit filled,"Joel Olsteen is the most positive minded speaker I've heard in quite some time. The content sometimes reminded me of the Prayer of Jabez where Wilkinson was criticized for encouraging people to reach for their potential & ""expand their boundaries"". Both Joel & Bruce just encourage us to use the talents & gifts God has given us. If we do not do that, I feel we're saying to God that we are not grateful for those blessings. They both encourage us to use what we have to first help others, and glorify God. Great listening & reading!"
1,300 used copies offered,"at ONE CENT,,finally its true worth comes through..,,,1 cent per copy.,,joel peddling his trash,,now offered at 1 cent"
5,THIS BOOK IS ALL YOU NEED!,THE FIRST TIME I SAW JOEL OSTEEN TEACHING I WAS HOOKED. SO THIS BOOK WAS A NO BRAINER! I PURCHASED THIS BOOK THE DAY IT WAS RELEASED AND IT HAS TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER!
2,Freaky-looking pastor,"As soon as I saw this book's cover, I thought Joel Osteen was very strange-looking. He seems to act like we can change whatever we want, but just look at his face on the cover! He can't change that!My idea of a minister is a bit more masculine than Joel Osteen."
2,Some good points here,"I love everybody and Joel is no exception. This book is a testimony of his life, though it's not for everybody. It's good to be optimistic, and sure God wants us happy and have our best life, however, this is just part of the big picture of what God has for us. Perhaps a good start to some who would have never approached God in the first place, thiniking He's a mean, punishing God. A few good seeds are planted here, but not too much..."
4,your best life now,"I started reading the negative reviews and the positive reviews. And what came to my mind is-We all judge too much. Yes reviews are for reviewing. But everyone has an opinion. And you know what they say about that. My opinion is, he is extremly inspiring. If you read the book, you don't need others reviews. Enjoy all the positive he has to say. And maybe it will make you feel like you can change your life for the better too. We can analyze the world. I'm sick of judging. I'm wanting to live, grow, learn, and enjoy. And most of life is about common sense."
4,Nice knife,"I cannot attest to its endurability but on my first camping trip this knife was the new star player of my gear. Very sharp out the box and so light I didn't even remember I had it clipped to my pocket a few times. It tore through tough steak like a laser!The finger flip is great but the thumb flip is almost useless and need to be modified; I'm not sure how I could even do this but I will probably try.Overall a great knife for the price.Update: Used it on a piece of flint and the blade dinged very easily. Used the back of the knife instead and this was damaged also. The steel is alot softer than I previously thought but for the price I still recommend this knife. Just don't use it like its invincible, its only a Gerber... I wouldn't depend on this knife with my life, I'll be buying a different one and keeping this as a back up."
5,Glam rock is alive and well in Chicago!,"The incredible Plastic Princess come crashing through true to form in their 1st professional album. It all starts off with a droning, lo-fi guitar screaming of Porno Engine. Dickie's amazing Corgan/Yankovic like lyrics with an occasional Manson-esque scream keep songs like Regretting Summer stuck in your head for days on end. A must buy for any fan of... GLAM METAL!"
3,Needs better closure,"I had been looking for a salt shaker that closed and wasn't made from glass. This seemed perfect. The top just pops on, which is a drawback. It needs to screw on to ensure it stays on while in your purse or on the coffee table where the dogs can knock it off. It also needs a stronger pop top closure since sometimes the top just pops open. Why else would anyone want a top that closes?"
3,Better as a thrift store find.,"I purchased these Salt & Pepper shakers with the idea of making shakers for cinnamon sugar and spice blends to use in cooking. However, they really are much too small for either purpose. As a cinnamon-sugar shaker, for example, I end having to refill them more than once a week.In addition, if any bits of spices get along the lid, it won't seal tightly and can spill when knocked over or the mixture can clump up if moisture gets inside. It might be just fine for a little breakfast nook table, but not moderate to heavy usage.I am usually a fan of Rubbermaid's durablity and simplicity, but this was a bit of a dud. Too small and not tightly enough sealed for my taste."
1,Bait and Switch,"I had a set of these before and liked that the tops would seal out moisture. The illustration on the site showed the same product I had owned before so I ordered them based on the photo. What I received is completely different and has a poorly sealing, hinged plastic top, not the flexible snap-on tops as shown on the photo. When I went back to the Amazon site the photo had been changed. I logged off and back on and, VOILA, the photo was again what was shown when I originally ordered the product. Something smells with ANTonline! Likewise the shipping cost is outrageous!"
5,Fills a real need,"I bought my car used. It is an older model and the drink holder was broken. Anytime you were foolishenough to trust it, you ended up with coffee/coke all over the place. This console organizer is greatto hold several drinks and has enough compartments to put all your stuff in. I love my organizer. It isinexpensive, looks good & has the capacity to hold a lot of things besides your drinks. Excellent purchase!"
1,doesn't hold up,Bought this a while back. Sides do not stay up and it is impossable to carry this when it has stuff in it. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Probably Would Be Good Pan if Not Chipped,I had to return this item because it was defective upon receipt. A piece of enamel was missing on one of the raised grill ridges. It looked like it would have been good but did not get to try. Colors are great. Amazon customer service was very fast and helpful.
2,Beware!,While the story was good and was a quick read...it should have come with a warning label...every other word is God or Jesus. I didn't know I was going to receive a Christian education while reading this book. The author spends entire pages in prayer. Definately not my cup of tea.
4,"Very cute, she loves it.","My 1 year old started to want to play with my purse all the time. I decided to get her her very own purse and this one had great reviews. I was not sure if she would like it since it does not have zippers or pockets like mommy's purse, but she loves it. She carries it around with her and plays with all the cool stuff inside."
4,Nice Set!,This little set is great! Very bright and colorful with cute accessories. I think any little girl would love this for pretend play.
4,We like it,"Our 19 month old enjoys playing with this purse. She enjoys the purse itself, the cell phone, and the lipstick the most. The mirror, keys, wallet, and credit card aren't played with much. The only complaint I have is that she is unable to open the wallet on her own. Trying to open the wallet frustrates her to no end--it's hard for a young toddler to have the dexterity to open such a thing."
4,Cute for a one- or two-year-old.,"I ordered this for a girl who's almost three, and while she loves it, there are a couple of things others should know before ordering. First, the phone doesn't do anything, which is a pro if you want a quiet toy, but a con to the kid trying to press its buttons and have it make a noise. Also, the coin purse has a clasp that is difficult for little hands to open, but she figured it out eventually. Apart from those two things, the purse is super cute and seems to be quite durable, as are the accessories that come with it. The girl likes to walk around pretending to apply lipstick and puts other stuff in the purse, so it's getting some good use. I think she was a little too old for it though. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone older than 3."
3,Disappointment,"My granddaughter likes to play with purses, so she had fun with this one, but when she was taking things out for the first time, she was excited about the cell phone, but quickly put it aside when nothing on it moved or worked. We'll get a play cellphone with sound at another store to put it, which is what kids are looking for these days. It was ok for the price."
3,Good gift for first birthday,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter's first birthday. She carries the purse around on her wrist, but she's not very interested in the accessories. Of course she'd rather play with my phone."
2,Very disappointed.....,"After reading all the great reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase this as a Christmas gift for my three year old. Boy, was I disappointed! My daughter opened this gift, emptied out the contents, looked over each item, and then left it there on the living room floor. After checking it out, I don't blame her. There really isn't much here to keep a 3 year old interested. They'd much rather have something as close to what mom has. Everything is made of cheap plastic, no moving parts, no buttons, nothing to manipulate. Yes, it would be good for pretend, but I think a 1 to 2 year old might enjoy it more for it's simplicity."
4,Very Cute,I got this purse for my 2.5 year old. She loves it. She wears it on her arm and pushes her stroller around. She calls it her mommy purse. The only draw back is that she can't open the wallet by herself. But she should learn how to in a few months. Very cute purse and seems durable.
3,"Decent product, but shipped second-rate","I ordered this for my niece and she loves it. I was disappointed to receive the package in second-hand condition. The tags were ripped off and there was no original packaging. I managed to make the look relatively attractive. Had I not been giving this to my young niece, the packaging would have been a complete embarassment."
3,"Very cute but...,","This is a very cute gift item for a little girl. It is everything the item descriptions say, but as a money-conscious shopper I realize that for a child of my granddaughter's age, this item, combined with shipping, was a bit too expensive. It would have been cheaper to by similart individual items at dollar-stores and put it together."
3,granddaughter's purse,"This is a X-mas present for my 22-month old granddaughter. I'm sure she is going to enjoy it, as she likes to put things in a container and takes things out."
3,Coin purse should open,The purse is very cute and fun for a toddler girl. My daughter got it at 20 months and has played with it for a year. Likes to put things in and out of the purse and pretends to use the phone. Only thing that would give this 5 stars is if the coin purse actually opened and you could put coins in it. She is constantly bringing it to me asking me to open it up.
4,My Niece loves it!,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the quality of the materials. It was worth the great price though!
2,Disappointed in the my first purse,"I ordered this purse for my daughters second birthday, I was very disappointed in the quality. The cell phone is VERY cheap plastic, and the buttons don't even push in. The ""wallet"" that comes with it is just a little fake plastic wallet that doesn't open. The keys are flimsy. The one this she does really like is the lipstick and the mirror. Just not what I was expecting!"
3,Good First Purse,"I bought this for my daughter at Christmas. At the time, she was 21 months. When I first received this purse, I was disappointed. The items inside seemed to be cheap plastic with no moveable parts (i.e. no buttons, twists, etc.) I thought my daughter would like it because she was always playing with my purse. She does play with some of the items inside, like the wallet (which opens and closes) and she puts on the lipstick (this item she loves). I think she would have more interest in it if some of the items were more realistic. We replaced the phone with one that has push buttons on it, so she uses it more. She never plays with the keys because they do not ""jingle"" like mom's keys to. All in all, I think this was a cute toy, but for my daughter, the items inside were not realistic enough."
4,first purse!,arrived in timely manner. grandaughter loves it. i don't really have any dislikes. its a perfect thing for her to play with and imitate mommy and nanny.
5,Everything a little lady on the go could need!,"I bought this for my two year old who is constantly wanting to carry my purse around the house and apply my chapstick. It's the perfect size and weight for a toddler and everything fits nicely into the bag. The unbreakable mirror is perfect and it easily wipes clean when it gets smudged (which it undoubtedly will). My favorite part is the little plastic lipstick because unlike my chapstick, I don't have to worry about a mess all over her face, or my house!"
5,My toddler loves this set,I purchased this purse set for my toddler when I noticed that she liked to play with my purse and the contents of it. She immediately took a liking to it. That was about a year ago. She still plays with it as if I just purchased it for her yesterday.
4,Cute set,I purchased this purse for my daughter who is almost 2. She loves playing with all the parts and I gave her some additional cards to put in the purse. Better than some of the other sets I found online.
4,Great purse set,"I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas, and my 4 year old unexpectedly got a different purse set for Christmas as well. The other purse set is based on a licensed character, but seems so much cheaper than this one. The items in this purse set are durable and fun, my 2 year old takes her phone everywhere! The only thing I might change is I wish the phone buttons made some kind of beep or squeak when you press on them, my 2 yo continues to be confused that the buttons don't do anything. But she loves it anyway."
4,15 month old daughter loves it.,"My 15 month old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it. I wish the phone buttons could be pushed or did something. Other than that, it is a fun toy and she walks around the house carrying her handbag just like mommy. Too cute!"
3,Toy,"I appreciate the quick delivery and the service, thanks a bunch...the toy however was a bit lame, all though it was worth the price. my daughter (as much as i think it is lame) loves it! lol. thanks!"
5,Great value for the money,"I did a LOT of research when looking for a TV and ended up deciding on the Panasonic TH-42PX60U (720p), when I went to the store to shop they had this EDTV version just beside it and it was very hard to tell the difference in picture, unless you were standing within 5 feet. The PD4260U was what I left with (on sale Sears for $1199!). I could not warrant spending the extra $800 for the one I had picked when I could hardly tell the difference in the picture. I have not yet used it with HDMI connection, but with HD cable service and component connections, the picture is incredible, even when downcoverted to 480p, progressive scan DVD also looks perfect, and even regular cable looks really good. Not a bad choice if you don't want to spend the extra $$$. My neighbor just bought a 40"" Samsung LCD HDTV and actually returned it and exchanged it for the same Panasonic EDTV set because he found the picture much clearer."
2,Disappointed,"I installed the table legs. They were much less robust than the one that had collapsed. But I needed the table then, so I left them on."
4,Pretty darn good,"I thought this stuff was bunk at first, but after two weeks, I really ""leaned"" out and beefed up a bit. Also , like the other reviewer, my sex drive hit ""tilt"". It actually helped me train harder , when used with NO-explode."
4,Simple but effective.,These stands a very basic in design but they work well and they look pretty nice too. The packaging is a bit of an issue though. The parts spend alot of time rubbing up against each other while enroute. It can mess-up the finish a bit.
5,Love these movies!!,I love these movies. Not completely representative of the books but fun to watch and good for the kids. I especially love the songs! takes me back to my youth!
3,Overshadowed But Still Worth Seeing,"Though the animated 1977 version of the Lord of the Rings is overshadowed by Peter Jackson's triolgy, the '77 is worth viewing. I saw it when it came out and viewed it again years later. Don't bother comparing with Jackson's movie, it's not even close. Jackson's Lord of the Rings is a great achievement. But if you just want a different slant on Tolkein's classic, the 77 movie is worth seeing.The main problem is, the collection is a hodepodge. The Lord of the Rings is pretty good, but it only covers the 1 and 1/2 books of the triolgly. The Hobbit was made for television by a different crew and has a whole different feel. Since the Hobbit was a children's book, the playful feel works. The real problem is The Return of the King. It has the same playful, made for children, feel as The Hobbit, and it doesn't work.The Lord of the Rings: 4 starsThe Hobbit: 3 starsThe Return of the King: 2 stars"
1,"""The Hobbit"" VHS quality is atrocious","My review isn't about the merits of the films, but rather the quality of the video of ""The Hobbit"" which is atrocious - as bad as any bootleg copy of a movie I've ever seen. LOTR and ROTK are fine - excellent copies, but Hobbit is fuzzy, yellowed, and just all around not worth having - I've returned my copy, and couldn't even stand watching it for five minutes.I understand the DVD is good, but this video is awful - get the DVD version (as it is really a cute version of the story)."
5,wow!,Hey this is great i didn't know Amazon.com has all 3 movies available. how did Amazon.com get these movies the 2nd part 3 towers is going to be released nxt month and Amazon already has all 3 movies! this is great. take my order pleez mr. customer srvice rep persons.
2,Good for kids but unbearable to watch for adults,"My 4 year old son adores the animated version of Lord of the Rings, but it is so hard to watch for more critical adults who have been exposed to the live action Peter Jackson films.The rotoscoping alone makes this hard on the eyes--while the pure animation is good (better than in the animated Hobbit or Return of the King, in my opinion), the rotoscoping is harsh and adds a discordant visual note to the film. The hobbits are drawn well, except for Sam, who is for some reason turned into a blithering idiot. Legolas looks like a bad plastic surgery ""after"", and Galadriel looks too much like Swan Lake Barbie to be believable as the elven queen.The story remains true to the book, though, so it's a good way to introduce kids to the story of LOTR...just try not to look directly at the rotoscoped orcs and Uruk'hai, who look like the Sandpeople from Star Wars."
3,Review for 2 of 3,"I have seen The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings and found I enjoyed The Hobbit much more. From what I here the two were from a different director. That doesn't suprise me AT ALL. The Hobbit is much more ""down to earth"" than The Lord Of The Rings, and the Lord Of The Rings is just... very surreal. Alot of the surrealism was due to live action trace overs. The trace overs are mixed with regular anime (wich I'm also not a BIG fan of), and is realy hard to wrap your brain arround. All I can say is that as I liked them both as much as they were due, but I will tell you you won't LOVE them both unless you have very braud range of enjoyment."
3,Classic trilogy,"Great condition. After the live action movies, these cartoons may seem very different, but the story is still good. They are very easy to get into and enjoy."
5,"Solid singing, Sincere delivery !","I bought this cd for one song. I wanted to learn the Irish National anthem (The Soldier's Song). I am quite pleased with the quality of the entire cd. Mr. McCann has a pleasant voice, excellent diction and phrasing. I think the best thing about his singing is his ability to sell the song. You can tell his feelings and emotions in each song are real !!"
3,Fairly decent listen....but not the greatest,"It was an enjoyable story with a few twists and really a great listen, but not the best I've ever read/listened to. If the other reviewers think Harlan Coben is a great mystery writer they haven't read Vince Flynn yet. Get his books in order, you'll love them. Not taking anything away from Harlan, I like him a lot, but lemme tell ya, Vince Flynn is fabulous. The very popular TV program ""24"" is taken from Vince's books."
4,Great read!,"I never ceases to amaze me just how mystery writers, especially Harlan Coben, can inventsuch devious, evil and self-serving characters. The twists abound and continue to the veryend of BACK SPIN. His unique grasp of current language is also worthy of mention -- he'squite a fun guy, indeed. I recommend this installment of the Myron Bolitar series withoutreservation."
2,Good story - terrible editing,"I am a big fan of Harlan Coben, but I can barely finish this edition of Back Spin. The editing is abysmal - there is an error on every second page. Most pronouns are capitalized and sentences begin with a lower case letter. The characters speak all in the same paragraph, so it is difficult to follow the narrative. I am new to Kindle. Is this what I will expect from this ebook format?"
3,Harlan,"Needed more Win, but since it is an old book, it worked out o k. Most of his books are good fun t read."
1,Yey ANOTHER display failure,"Like another reviewer, I too am in Texas. After just 6 weeks the display failed for me too. The unit still works with the last settings I entered, but I cannot now make any changes. Presumably when the batteries run out and it loses its settings it will be worthless.POOR quality - display failure seems common! No use without a working display. AVOID at all costs!"
1,Why does this keep happening??,"I have never seen this film. The horrible reviews were enough to keep me away. But I will say this: seems like every year some poor, pathetic creature attempts to cash in on the Beatles' popularity. First came Alone and Together, then Alf Bicknell's Beatles Diary, Celebration, Love Me Do, the Big Beat Box...you get the picture. I'd have a great DVD collection were it not plagued with bad Beatles films! Every now and again there's a break (like Anthology or the First US Visit) but on the whole, there is a dark cloud of unauthorized, lousy material that keeps coming out. Somebody should do something about this."
2,mostly unredeeming,"Marcus is sometimes capable of great insight. Unfortunately these rare gems are sandwiched between pages and pages of rambling nonsense. This guy mistakes the blips and farts of his slightly soft brain matter for objective sociological insight. Well I, for one, won't stand for it. Down with Marcus and all he stands for."
4,New Music from the North Coast,"This group is loaded with talent. The music is easy to listen to with excellant guitar and percussion, a stand up bass and a nicely matched collection of songs. I think it's a great addition to any collection."
3,kind of dissapointed,"Owning three electric guitars, I thought it was time to get an acoustic and wanted a good song to learn. ""Patience"" is one of the best, IMHO, so I picked up this book. Wow, what a dissapointment! It didn't sound at all like the song. This was more like a version of Patience, instead of the actual song. EVen my teacher told me not to bother with the CD because the rendition was so bad, and considering the CD is more than half the cost of this book, I felt a bit ripped off by the poor quality. However, the tab isn't bad, it's pretty acurate from what I can tell, so I'm trying to give a fair review and give it three stars. If you really want to learn this song, go check out Justinguitar.com. He's got the best version and teaches it far better than this book does!"
3,Piedmontese War,"The book covers the short campaign that led to the creation of the unified state of Italy. It's short and sweet, without too much detail, and, as is usual for books from this publisher, has errors from the scanning process and no illustrations. Its main advantage is that no other author wrote a book on this campaign, and the other edition may be hard to find or more expensive. Unless you are really a history enthusiast, you may just want to look up the campaign on Wikipedia."
2,Lack of maps and very confusing!,"I did not like this book. There were only two very poor maps in the book. I had to pull out a map of Italy and track the battle using the rivers because a lot of the towns were not on the map I used. The book also did not flow well. There was also too many named generals, etc,."
5,Wonderful Book for Beginners,"This is a wonderful book about the shih tzu. It includes detailed information on raising a litter, even how to revive puppies, etc. She gives some information on grooming and what products to use even addresses on where to get those. The part I love the most is the champter feeding even the most finiky eater."
2,"Okay, but not what I expected","This book is OK if you actually have a product to sell. If your business, like mine, is a service business this book offers little help in creating ""Off the Wall"" marketing ideas. At least 70% of the book involves high dollar radio, TV, and other expensive marketing ideas. Very little practical examples of non budget busting ideas..."
2,Feels like a windows ME experience,This is potentially a great game. I really like playing it. Unfortunately it freezes every couple of minutes and I need to get up and turn off my Xbox manually to start it up again. I think my review would be much better if I actually got to play for more than 5 minutes at a time. Check out the Lionhead (maker of the game) online forums for information about how many people are having this problem. Wait to buy this game right now as it is unplayable in it present form.
1,I never received it.,"I never received the game, I ordered it Feb 3 and have not been able to figure out through the site how to get a refund since every time I go to ""where's my stuff?"" nothing shows up. However, I have a confirmation email stating that the game was purchased and also the money was taken out of my bank account."
1,"Game freezes, completely un-playable.","This game has a huge bug that causes it to freeze and glitch. Started happening to me shortly after i got through the childhood scene. After that I couldn't take more than a few steps in game before it started freezing.I tried contacting Lionhead for support and they gave me a canned response that totally skirted the issue then directed me to their forums. I posted in the forums in a thread 20+ pages long. These freezes soon started happening outside of fable 2. Now i have to send my xbox in for repairs. My xbox was not having issues before I played fable 2 and is now having issues all the time. It's not the RRoD, but a glitch that seems to be repeatable on many other customers machine too. Columns of white artifacts, freezing and a loud buzzing noise.If you decide to buy this game, definitely do a lot of research. This is not an isolated issue and Lionhead isn't acknowledging."
3,Would've gave this game 5 stars but....,"The first Fable game was fun. It showed great potential for a franchise series. A few years later, out comes Fable 2. As far as overall game play & story line, this sequel was much fun. I had no problems as far as that subject goes. You level up as you progress through the game. Skills & magic improve the more you play. Graphics were beautifulMy only issue?? The Final Battle. If you remember the first Fable, the final boss battle with Jack of Spades was epic. In Fable 2, well... At first, I thought I didn't do something. After playing again I thought ""That's It!!?"".I would've gave this review 5 stars if it wasn't for the final battle. The game is fun & at the price this game is, I'd recommend it. Just don't be surprised if you come out a little disappointed at the end."
4,Good,This game is great RPG. Only problem with it is how laggy the game play can get towards the end of the game.
5,The Game Your Wife/Girlfriend/Significant Other Could Love,"I credit Fable II with getting my wife into gaming. It provided many nights of fun for us both, sharing the controller, making decisions about the character ""Sparrow"" would be, and praising our canine sidekick ""Sniffy"". The graphics are excellent, the combat/story/levelling up mix works, and the plot narrative, characters and locations in the fictional world of Albion kept us coming back for more."
2,Not At All...,"this is a Continuation of Fable 1...but this game is no way, shape or FORM anything BETTER than Fable 1...if anything, it is a step backwords. the graphics are in alot of ways WORSE than Fable...the Music is EXACTLY like Fable..this game in General did just Not do the trick for me. i would rather play through the entire first game than play through one mission of this. they tried, i give them credit..but they would been better off putting Downloadable Content on Xbox Live for the First fable instead of coming out with a brand new game.get Fable (original version) for the xbox...and leave this alone, trust me, your not missing ANYTHING...iLL ."
5,Love this game,"This game is great. Graphics, game play, story and interaction are all there. The first was really good, i play it over sometimes. Once i played this one it seemed to be like the first one... i was glad to be wrong. The added features make this game better than the first one"
1,Terrible crap packaged onto a disc.,"You know the game ending glitches people have been so pissed about? Well, it happened to me and it completely pisses me off. The game ending glitch happened to me in bloodstone. Not only that, it started to stall and not load screens. Then my saved games got corrupted. This is absolutely unacceptable. What even pisses me off even more is the company who created this game did not fix it! Trash! I will not support this company AT ALL in the future. Screw um."
3,"You could do it all, but why would you want to?","It's alright. Professions, real estate and marriage all take too much time. I just want to play a game, not a life simulator."
2,Definitely one of the buggiest games of the year...,"I've never had a console game with so many glitches and errors. Between missions that can't be completed, NPCs that won't keep up with their end of the script, and just plain 'ol lock-ups, I'd only be willing to pay about $15 for this game. Too late for me, though, already bought it at full retail.This is what I expect from an early beta, not a commercial release.Seems like it had a decent underlying story though, if I could have looked through all the bugs. The bugs & lockups really detracted from the experience for me. There were entire sections of the story line that I ended up missing, because I couldn't get to certain regions without the game locking up."
3,Good but not finished.,I've completed this game and wanted to enjoy it. I even saw the potential to enjoy it but the bugs killed my gaming experience. I was not bothered by the choppy sluggish menu control or the occasional graphical gliches like how I hovered everywhere I went after I got interupted in a fall animation. I had a kid that became autistic and was forced to kill the mother because it was just too annoying to deal with. I will never be able to have the Daichi Katana because the person I was playing coop with closed the gate before I got through. In addition now I can no longer examine NPC's. I suggest waiting six months for this game to be patched before buying or playing. It has the potential to be a great game just too bad it's so buggy.
4,Fabalicious,Fable 2 overall is a great game. the replayability is wonderful in which everytime is a whole new character with their own personal adventure becasue every little thing you do within the game makes you and your enviorment change. great for anybody who loves rpg action type games.
2,All that hype for nothing,"I think that I am adding this game to my category of ""Biggest 2008 Disappointments"". All this hype and excitement that revolved around this game for months, years... and when I finally slam it into my xbox it is probably the most glitchiest game that i have ever played. Want a family? Oh sure. Oh wait, little Timmy has turned into a zombie. Oh, you're looking for your husband? Oh, he randomly disappeared... The game is short. I beat it in 3 days and you know how you were told that the world was huge in Fable 2? It's not. It's very small. There are probably only 3 or 4 towns tops and the majority of them look the same.I'm returning this ASAP. I can use that $60 for something useful and entertaining."
2,Play at your own risk.,"Let me tell you I had fun with this game. I was married twice, and had a child. i was following the adventures and increased my experience. I was having the time of my life. Then my game froze. I thought it was the 360 itself, but all my other games work fine. This game has too many glitches. I tried to start over many times, but I can't get past the opening sequence of eternal bird pooping. Some have no issues with this game, while others are having difficulty. So, if you buy this game, be aware that it is at your own risk."
2,I'm glad I rented it first!,"I don't do many reviews but I can tell you that this game is extremely boring! Quests and jobs and plot, why do you have to do the same job for an hour. Seriously who wants to be a blacksmith and hit a target for that long?! I just purchased my Xbox 360, and I am really glad this was a rent and see instead of blowing some major bucks! If you have a lot of time on your hands it would be great, but other than that, don't bother!"
2,Disappointment,"Fable was among my favorite games for the xbox. Fable II promised alot and delivered a game that is seriously lacking many qualities. The story is tedious and frankly boring, the maps are difficult to use, the ""action"" is sporadic and often not very good, in total the game over promised and under delivered. Rather than a great sequel to a great orginal game, this came off as a tired re-tread almost a low budget knock off of the original. A tremendous dissappointment. I would add the the added adult content really makes this game inappropriate for anyone under 18 years of age. This game was a tragic failure."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I beat fable 1 around 6 times,this one i beat 1 time.Fable 2 is a downgrade from fable 1 in almost every way-the combat is genaric and shallow-story is just horrible(if you can call it a story)-magic is horrible,all spells have practically the same effect and are difficult to swith in combat.-gun aiming is a minor improvment-character variance is ..ok at best-has some good environments-Over forgettable"
3,Fable Review,I would have made it a little more different with the fighting possibilities from the first one.
2,Stay Away From All Of Lionhead,"Ok first off ill start by saying i was a huge fan of the original fable and actually preordered fable 2...Big mistake. Ill tell you all a word of advice right now, never Ever listen to a word Peter Molyneux or anybody that comes out of Lionhead spews out because it is all just for hype and always ends in making you feel like an idiot for believing them.Onto the review of the game, as far as an rpg goes it was Decent but nothing special. As far as a Fable sequel goes it is horrible, story wise its not Fable 2 but more of Fable 1.5 or even 1.25, compared to the firsts compelling story this plot goes nowhere and you can see the ending from a mile away. Not only that but Lionhead even struck the low blow of leaving critical story points (post ending-pre fable 3) in costly DLC.Bottom line is i learned my leason and will never buy a Lionhead game again and id recommend you do the same."
3,Nice size bag. Big construction flaw though,"I got this bag needing a good size duffle bag that would accommodate a couple nights worth of clothes. When I got it I really like the size, color and all the pockets. Felt very nice in my hands, this was going to be a good bag. When i was walking out to my car with a full bag ready to go to the airport the plastic buckle harness broke off. This didn't leave me much time considering I was going to the airport. I stopped off and got some carabiners from a sports store on the way and replace both sides. Works much better now. Just wondering why they would make that little clip out of plastic when they know it is going to have some weight on it almost all the time."
3,Missing a lot,"I will have to keep searching for something else. The first 5 albums I looked up were not in this book, and they are not the types that the book said were left out. 3 were country, 1 was jazz, and 1 was big band."
5,A decent translation,This was a decent translation of the Apology. The language was accessible and it was the complete Apology dialogue as given by Plato.
3,Font is too small,"I haven't even started reading this book yet and may never. The type is so small that it makes it very difficult to read, even with glasses."
4,overall good product and good price,"A good bit cheaper than the local pet store if you don't mind waiting on shipping. This does the job it's supposed to do. It came with soft rubber caps to put on the end of each prong, but they don't fit too well. anyway I don't know who would buy a prong collar then put rubber on all the prongs anyway... but if you're planning to do so, you might want to have some glue handy. but this is a sturdy and seemingly well-made collar. easily adjustable also."
5,Great product,"Great product! It was bigger than I needed, but it is nice how easy it is to remove extra prongs and get it down to size."
1,DO NOT BUY,"the rubber feet fall off, making it uselessthe rubber feet fall off, making it uselessthe rubber feet fall off, making it useless"
2,not very usable,"The metal used for this color is SO stiff, it is VERY difficult to take on & off and adjust the links. I have seen video of this type of collar and they should ""pinch"" quite easily to take links on & off and to put the color on & off, as in ""just pinch, and the prongs slip right in"" NOT this collar. The metal on this is so thick I had to use heavy duty pliers to try to get the prongs ""pinched"" to be able to even take the collar off & on. I learned that this type of collar should not be slipped over the head, it should open up & be clipped closed."
2,Pay more for a better one,"Too hard to pull over my dog's ears. Cheap metal rusted after a few uses. The concept works and it did stop Max from pulling. I liked that it came with plastic caps for the prongs, which I used and it kept my 100 pound 2 year old lab in check.I purchased another prong collar for a few more dollars that has a clasp which allows me to remove the collar without stressing out my dog. Just as effective and so much easier to get on and off! Don't waste your money!"
2,This if for a giant dog.,"I have a 90-lb dog with a 22"" neck and this collar was giant on him. I removed 3 links and he still looked goofy. The links are just too wide. This might be a good fit for a 120+ lb. dog"
1,Not worth the Purchase,I ordered this item and it took a week to get it. I used it the first time at a puppy training class that I attended. The 2nd night we used it we had our puppy out for a walk and it just fell off. My boyfriend tried to fix it and the next day I took my puppy out for a walk and just started to jog and it fell apart again and my puppy took off. Fortunately we were able to catch our Siberian since we were on a closed road. I then tried to order a replacement in chance that it was a defective item and was told the replacement would not ship for a month. I don't think it's even worth my time to put in a box and send back. Not worth it- I'm just out the money spent. At least I have my puppy safe and sound and know I won't waste my time again on a product like this online.
4,Not bad,"This is a good workout for those who might be just getting started on a workout routine and are looking for something that is not so terribly intense, or is hard to remember. Since I travel a lot I cannot always bring the DVD with me everytime I go out on the road, but I remember the routines easy enough and have modified them to fit what I want/need."
1,firefighters workout,"This is not for the advanced. I had to do both workouts just to feel like it was worth my time and effort and I still feel like it was a waste of money. In addition, the instruction was boring. I have been doing various workout videos such as The Firm and Crunch for years with much success and found this to be a let down."
4,KKK,"The Klan in the City is such a sufficient book to explain how deep the roots of the Klan has reached by the time passed in that Mr. Jackson demonstrates that also some relatively newer cities have been in relation with the Klan. I really enjoyed reading the book, for I like reading books about America, particularly those ones that are about groups like the Klan. My only observation about the book is that it is concerned about the Klan in only 1920s. I would be more interested in it if only it contained more details about the first foundation of the Klan in 1865 after the Civil War. That's why I gave only 4 stars. Generally speaking, this is one the best books about the Klan that I can highly recommend."
5,Great Voice performs Soothing Classics,"If you appreciate the solid musicianship and vocal vibrancy of Marilyn Horne, you will love her interpretation of these classic lullabies. The emphasis here is always on the beauty of her voice, not the particular arrangements although these support Ms. Horne very, very well. If you appreciate the true art of great singing, this cd is for you!"
5,Works Great!,"This HDMI Switch works great, and automatically switches between my DVR and my PS3 perfectly. Couldn't ask for much more, that's what it's supposed to do and it does it."
1,Doesn't work - Tech support terrible,"This product doesn't work with all HDMI devices, at least, I think it doesn't because after 45 minutes of waiting on the phone for tech support from Audiovox, I had processed returning the device. I would never recommend purchasing this device or anything else from Audiovox. The resonse time for tech support was totally unacceptable especiall when after about 17 minutes of waiting, a tech rep answered and immediately put be back on hold which then put at the end of the line of calls received. Somehow I missed that this was an Audiovox product. Had I seen that, I never would have purchased it since most of what they make is junk."
1,Not what you think it is,Product did not work as stated in sales literature and called for support and got an errogant kid on the phone and said it works but only if you meet the specs in small print in the instructions. Sounds great but sent it back.
5,Good product,Easy to set up and use. The connections are sturdy and transmit well this was a good addition to my system to expand it.
2,Only works with some devices,"I only use the switcher in manual mode and I can't get it to work with half of my devices. It works with my Comcast DVR and my Roku box but it *doesn't* work with my AppleTV and my new Toshiba Blu-ray player. For the price, I expect the unit to be able to work with all of my devices. I do not recommend this device."
4,DID NOT WORK FOR ME!,"This product would not work for me. I was using it with an RCA Scenium 50"" projection LCD TV, PS3, and Scientific Atlanta HD Time Warner Cable box with DVR. Apparently my TV is not compatible with the switch. When I connect my cable box or PS3 directly to the TV it works fine. When I try to run the cable box through the switch I get the sound but on screen I get the message ""NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HDCP. CONNECT COMPONENT CABLES TO TO WATCH TV""I rated the product four out of five stars since the switch did it's job. The problem seems to be with my TV. Whenever I would turn on the PS3 it would switch, when it was off it would go back to the cable box.EDIT: From the research I have done it seems the problem I'm having is with the SA 8300 cable box and HDCP problems. I've had the box for around 3 years so I'm thinking about exchanging it with TWC and see if that works."
2,Lots of Static,"The monitor works and it is nice to have two receivers, but since it is not 900 mHz like our other one, there is a ton of static on the receiving end. I would recommend making sure it says 900 Mhz."
2,NOT VERY GOOD MONITORS,"TONS OF STATIC, THEY DIDN'T LAST LONG. THEY WON'T HOLD A CHARGE AND WORK SOMETIMES AND LOSES ITS POWER OTHER"
2,Bad experience makes me give up,"I bought this slim model last year after my older vacuum was past it's prime. I was happy for a while- the smaller size, the lighter weight and the way the head swiveled was great. I have two small dogs, however, and one of them sheds like crazy- so the sucktion would give up regularly. I would have to take off the canister and pull the hair out because it would clog up so quickly. I constantly was having to turn off the vacuum to pull the hair out. When I would use the hand tool to get the edges and small areas, there was NO SUCTION. I looked everywhere in the manual, I tried to contact Dyson, I was not able to get an answer to why the suction on the extention was not working.I gave up. I finally went back to the reasonably priced Hoover and have never been happier. My carpet hasn't been this well vacuumed in over a year.I'm sure Dyson is a great product, but it seems I may have ended up with the lemon."
5,Best vacuum I have ever owned!,I LOVE this vacuum. Light and easy to push. It also cleans just as advertised.
3,Using the 5 year warranty,"We've loved and used our Dyson often. I have dust allergies and we have 2 dogs.Unfortunately we are taking it in for another 5 year warranty repair at 4.5 years later, this is the second time in recent months.At this point we are considering a 2nd vaccuum since the repairs take a week."
1,Suction does suck,"After spending nearly $400 on one of these, I still borrow my daughter's cheap Hoover about once a month just to get the dirt. When the head's cheap plastic clasp broke, I happily thought I'd be rid of the Dyson, but the warranty did replace the clasp and I guess I am stuck with the vacuum. It's been very disappointing."
3,heavy,I am disappointed in this vac-it is much heaver than I expected and somewhat hard to turn and maneuver. Certainly not easy to use.
2,Too much money for good vacuum,"I have owned this vacuum for about a month before I decided to return it to target. I have found a few flaws with it that I shouldnt have, considering the price I paid for it.It is a great vacum when it works fine, however if you happened to get someting on your way of vacumming and it gets caught in the brush - the brush attachement will stop working - you then have to rescrew it and reassemble the whole attachement.Secondly, the tool attachement is placed so akwardly, and it is not at all convinient to use it. The storage compartment is also very small and you have to empty it frequently. Overall it is a good vacuum - it didn't seem slim as the name suggest - I cannot imagine what size a regular dyson would be - difinetely storage issue. Dont get into the hype of the product - the are many vacuums out there much cheaper for same value. Buy from a place that accepts returns without hassle in case if you run into similar issues as I did."
2,Lacks cohesion,"A lot of tidbits and what I would consider to be gossip. I was hoping for something that was a little more objective and well put together, so this was of no help in my research. To me it needs to be tied together,edited, and put into some kind of order."
3,You won't believe it!,"If you think only of the Phantom, when you think of Michael Crawford, you are in for a great & wonderful surprise!"
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I first heard a friend's copy of this in the late 1990's, and had recorded it to cassette. I'm thankful for thinking at that time to write down the CD title and certain details too. As a result, I was able to find the CD here on Amazon.Standout numbers include ""Fanfare for the Common Man"", ""Hoedown"", ""America - The Dream Goes On"" and the ""America Medley"""
5,awesome book,"This is my first predator book and i thought that it was an exellent one. It starts out talking about predator and that makes you want to read further. The gore is very detailed and the action is intense, the story was great. Get this book by all means. You will regret it if you dont."
2,Battery has little capacity,I purchased this battery for my daughters Razr cell phone and she stopped using it after a few days because the charge would only last a few hours. She's away at college so the returns process would probably take more time than it's worth ... and she has switched to a different phone.
2,Title misleading,"This battery was not in ""Original Motorola Retail Package"" as stated. Simply it came in a little plastic covering, leading me to wonder how reliable the battery really is. We'll have to see, but i have my doubts."
3,Meh.,"Though the model is the same (BR50), the item numbers differ slightly - SNN5696D vs SNN5696C. This isn't EXACTLY what Motorola would send you if you bought a battery from them, but it seems to work.When my phone was new I could go two or three days, with moderate use, without charging. In the past couple months, I can't even get a full 24 hours with NO use, and talk time runs about 15-20 minutes max. I figured this battery couldn't be any worse, so took a gamble, as I can't justify spending $40 on a battery. While it's definitely better than my aging SNN5696C (I can get a full conversation in without the phone beeping LOW BATTERY, or even dropping into orange), it still requires nightly charging.You clearly won't get the results out of this that you would buying a new battery directly from Motorola, but if you're desperate and strapped for cash, this isn't a TERRIBLE purchase."
3,Decent,"I'm not so sure this battery was brand new when I recieved mine. The first couple of days the battery was fine, then the life drained out of it after mere hours.. eh, what can you expect for only paying 3 bucks for... good for price.."
1,Holds charge less than one day.,I charge this battery over night and before the end of the next day I get the low battery warning. This is even worse than the old battery I was replacing. I don't even use my phone much (1 or two calls a day for a few minutes each) but I want the battery to work when I need it. This purchase was a waste of money.
1,Beware!,I read some negative reviews on this type of purchase after I had already purchased this battery. Let me say I also found that these batteries although they appear new behave as if they aren't. Mine is only a few weeks old and is already loosing it's charge as fast as my 18 month old one. Probably worth the extra money to buy a new fresh one directly from the cell plan provider.
2,weak battery,This battery last maybe 12 hours in a razr. It is not a good choice for replacing your old battery.
3,Replacement Battery,"This replacement battery for my V3c Razr doesn't have as much power as the original battery that came with the phone, but for the price, it works fine."
4,Authentic Motorola battery with quick delivery.,"If you need a backup or replacement battery, do not hesitate to buy this one. It's the same ""black"" battery Moto is shipping with new v3's."
2,Motorola Razr Battery - ok on performance,"Purchased 3 of these since they were about $4 each, although paying $4 in shipping a piece is a bit much. They arrive in the same padded envelope and didn't cost $12 to ship from CA to KS. Even though the battery is labeled Motorola, it doesn't perform as well as the original OEM battery for my razr v3 did. That battery had 280 hours of talk time on it before being replaced. These new one's seems to be weak, I'm only on my first one, so I can update after using the other two that was purchased."
5,Replacement Battery,Awesome Deal!!!! works great holds charge like original and much cheaper ($3.80 each piece) vs. the $50 Radio Shack gets for the same battery.
5,Very good deal,The battery is very good (same as in Verizon store for 59.99). You can not beat the price.
1,Not too great,"I think this was the same one I had bought a year earlier which worked great. Wanted to get another, read the reviews and seemed hit or miss. I guess I missed this time, pretty much worthless."
2,BR 50 Batteries,I got 2 batteries in this order. One battery seems to be fine and hold a charge for several days. The other battery seems to keep a charge for only a short time.
1,Don't bother,Don't bother wasting your money. Neither of the two batteries I ordered kept a charge for more than 12 hours. Go to the cell phone store and get one there. If it doesn't work at least it is easier to return.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"The merchandise is shoddy. I ordered 2 batteries. When I got them, I fully charged both. Unfortunately they only last about 15 minutes, which is ridiculous. My expectation was no hours of talk time, but I thought they would at least function as a fully charged battery should.The company is shady. I formerly posted about the problem that I had with the battery, and then was contacted by eForcity asking to remove my negative feedback in return for replacement merchandise. I removed my feedback and they never sent the replacements. When I emailed them over a week later and attached the original email offering me the deal, and my reply when I accepted their offer, their response was ""do you want to have a replacement on this item."" I'm pretty sure that was the point of me emailing them inquiring about when I would get my new batteries.This company has poor business practices and sells merchandise that doesn't even live up to minimal expectations."
1,I don't recommend it at all.,Bought 4 of these. None of them holds up the charge for 30min talk. I don't recommend it at all.
4,A great first book of slow cooker recipes.,"There are lots of different recipes in here. But the best thing is that they aren't all ""add a can of cream of whatever soup."" There are a few of those, too, but these are actual recipes that anyone can make. You throw everything together and a few hours later, you have dinner!Some of the recipes include pictures; most don't. One thing that's a little surprising is the variety of recipes. There are dinner recipes, of course, but there are also appetizers and hot beverages, sides, and desserts. (Fruit and Nut Baked Apples! Yum!)If you're not already a slow cooker convert, what are you waiting for?? This is not just for people who work all day, this is for anyone who has errands to run, and doesn't want to rush dinner at the last minute. With this cookbook, you will find something to please everyone in your family, from elaborate (spareribs simmered in orange sauce) to simple (macaroni and cheese)."
4,nice pictures,love this book. decided to also get one for my daughter and a friend. lovely pictures that inspire to cook and ingredients easy to find.
3,I like the series,Mu - it seems all the series have something interesting - at least a couple of tracks. I've just been picking them up because they're cheap. All sound pretty good 5.1 that is. Nice but not mind blowing - better than silverliner. Some tunes are nice some are just OK but like I said there seems to be something redeemable on each. All of them are a mixed bag of electronica some a bit more on the rap. If I recall this is more on the electronica side. FWIW
2,Not Worth Your Time,"The blender that came in the poorly packaged box was already broken when it reached my house. Wires were detached, preventing it from being able to work. Nothing happened when I pushed the buttons even though the blender was clearly plugged in. I was just about to return it or get it replaced, but luckily, my father opened it up and managed to fix it.I do not recommend buying this blender. It is very low quality and it would probably be worth investing in a more expensive blender instead. The blender is very noisy."
3,Good and bad points to Oster 10 speed blender,"I wish I had ordered a more powerful blender. I ordered this one, the Oster 6629 10-speed 450 Watt Blender, to make Smoothies. I will not crush even pre-crushed ice, and bogs down on fruit. I can use it but not for the purpose I wanted."
1,POS,"This thing lasted for exactly 2 uses before the smoke escaped. First time it actually did OK blending a frozen drink. Second time it couldn't handle hummus at all. I've always had cheap blenders, and this is the first one that I've had break."
3,looks like okay,"i want a making juice product, but this product is not very well. i don't like it very well. but it can make fruit milk.if you only want to make fruit milk or vegetable milk, this product is a better choice."
3,"service was great and all but,","my product came, and the wrist rest part was smashed and flatter than it should be. idk how this happens but it makes it less comfy than it should be =/"
2,Not enough support,Seems the pad its self is good. I like the shape and size. The wrist support though is sub-par in my opinion. This pad has a foam wrist support which is way to soft. It feels like my wrist is sinking in when I use it. I never had that problem with gel supports before. At the price I really can not complain though. I just do not think I would have bought this no matter the price if I had looked at it in a store and felt it before buying.
4,Works with optical mouse,"I was having trouble moving my wireless optical mouse (seemed to stick and snag). I thought I needed a new mouse, but decided to try a new mouse pad first. This mouse pad REALLY helped. I use less effort moving the mouse.PROS:Larger sizeEase of use with optical mouseFairly comfortableReasonable priceI don't need a new mouseCONS:Gel wrist pad is starting to get a mild dent where I rest my wrist.The sides of the pad were slightly curled on arrival, and it continues to be as curled months later. Note that the curls do not affect use or comfort at all."
1,DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SOFT MEMORY FOAM TO ME!!,"I have a true sample of the memory foam used in the mattresses, and this wrist pad was far from it! It was hard and very uncomfortable. If it truly was soft memory foam inside, the fabric around it was pulled taut enough that you couldn't feel any softness or sponginess. My wrist would get really sore from resting on it. I agree with others, though, that the flat area for the mouse was nice and spacious and very good quality."
2,wrist rest hurts my wrist,"I like the dark black color of this mouse pad, but the wrist rest is not very comfortable. In fact, my wrist hurts every time I use this mouse pad. I am not sure if it has anything to do with I am a woman and have small wrist, but I always have to press/push really hard with my wrist for the memory foam to form some shape and have to continue pressing very hard for the memory foam to not return to its original state. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a small wrist."
5,Shower Organizer just what I was looking for,I had been looking for a shower organizer with these specific features - hanging over the door with double racks and hangers. It has suction cups to keep it from flopping around when the shower door is opened and closed.
5,A+,"I would have to say that even a few men should read this book ---- You dont even have to consider yourself a ""metro-sexual"" male..... It just gives you some pointers on how to be a little more modern and prepared for 2007 and beyond!"
4,"Quality entertainment, baby, oh yeah!","Let me just say that this movie had me laughing through most it. With stars like Samuel L. Jackson playing a schizophrenic hobo with razor sharp wit, and John Turturo and Steve Buscemi (spelling?)playing wacked-out ghetto whitey's-what's not to love?"
1,The search for a better movie,I have read the other reviews and I don't think I saw the same movie they did. I had to watch this movie in four sittings as I kept falling asleep while watching it. It was far from funny. It moved slow and had one funny character in the whole movie and that was Jimmy's dad who barely appeared. I am shocked that so many known actors would even consider to appear in this movie. ...
5,Great story - very realistic,"The portrayal of our defense industry in this story is unfortunately accurate. We have placed so much emphasis on ""smart weapons"", that we have forgotten the real effectiveness of our military. The action and pace of this book will keep the reader enthralled and they will not want to put it down."
4,thought provoking and exciting read,"I enjoy most of Rakph Peters books, and think Traitors is one of his finest.His writing is tight and obviously well researched. The characters are believable and plots grab you by the neck. I read this when I should have ebbn sleeping..couldn't put it down."
4,Nice Book,I really liked this book. Goldin has done a great done putting our heroes in the path of a mad Organian. I liked the first part of the book before they met Enowil. But the trip through madworld is a bit tedious and the subplot between the girl and the Romulan is a bit bland. Overall though it was very entertaining. I really enjoyed it!
5,Humour filled short passages to read again and again,Such a delight! I read this book from cover to cover and simply restarted it again immediately. Lots of smiles and good thoughts for those of us struggling with sobriety and maintaining our sense of self and humor. DEFINITELY worth reading!
1,Too much money for the piecemeal work.,"I received the foldable mission cart and once it was put together, I found there was an inner curve to the bottom side making a set of the folding bottom tray into it's hook impossible. I had wanted the foldable mission cart for the express reason of being able to roll it. The contents would spill out of the bottom tray, so I received excellent service from the chat service, receiving a return slip by email. Pleasantly surprised by this quickness of delivery of the second unit again, this quick delivery was also the case with the first unit and most recommended, I repackaged the first, but first put together the new one. It was a different color, green and slightly oily and there was a large crack in the cover tray. Though the covers for the screws in back were slightly different size, I put it together piecemeal, proceeding to send the rest back. This is too much money for the work."
5,Just right,"This cart was received timely, was easy to assemble, rolls smoothly and looks great. The price is very good for a fine quality product."
1,Very flimsy -- BUT READ THE FINE PRINT!!,"GOOD NEWS first: The delivery was on time and it arrived undamaged.BAD NEWS #1: The ""foldable"" nature of this product, however, makes it too flimsy to use-- the shelves and wheels were too loose to be stable. The whole thing was wobbly when finished, which was too bad because the actual wood was good quality. Poorly conceived - it would have to go back.BAD NEWS #2: I packed it back up to return it, but then I read the fine print on the return instructions in the box. I'd have to pay for shipping BOTH directions (it's heavy!).BAD NEWS #3: On top of it all, I'd have to pay a 20% ""re-stocking fee"". I was already out of pocket $90 for a $60 item - now these additional fees would mean I'd only be refunded $19 of my $90! (That's $71 in ""fees"" for a $60 item!)BAD NEWS #4: After wasting $71 on fees for an item so flimsy and unusable, I STILL have no printer stand and am back where I started from!"
1,Terrible Software Misleading Description,This was given to me as a gift in order to help me write short stories. There was really nothing to this software except some hack's cliched views on what story development should be. This is not only a waste of money (in my case it was a gift) -this is a waste of time for anyone trying to figure it out.
1,Deception,"It seems that all the microsoft publisher 2000 books do not mention what program they are dealing with other than microsoft publisher 2000 which is not sufficient. It is a pity that a company can't spell out what they don't include and still use what the computer has on its programs. Of all the books on Microsoft Publisher 2000 which I do have, don't mention it isn't any use for microsoft publisher 2000, home publishing. I have sent the book back and wonder if any of the other books listed do the same thing as IDG"
2,A Dissapointment,This book was little more than a list of concerts and playlists. The book repeats itself and becomes a drudgery by the halfway point. I think the real point to the book was so David Crosby could pat his friends on the back and take cheap shots at his enemies.
4,Good ring,"The ring has a nice look and feel, and the ring size was no larger or smaller then ordered (size 10 for me). The only complaint is that the two inside edges are bit on the sharp side. It is really only a problem when the ring gets hung on somthing for example the lip of a pants poket retriving wallet or keys."
5,Christmas 2007'3 Favorite Toy,"The Schoenhut Elite Spinet was as expected/advertised. The piano was the hit of our grand daughters christmas. While she ""plays"" it constantly, we can't wait for her to get a little older (she is currently 2 1/2)to learn to play it better and to the music. Regardless, we are very happy with the purchase and relieved that you can still buy quality products that will hold up to vigorous play and will not go out of style or interest any time soon. We personally think this will spur our grand daughter on other musical interests - not a bad thing."
5,Schoenhut Piano,"I purchased the Spinet upright piano from this seller, and they were out of stock. Since I needed it to arrive in time for my soon to be 2 year old granddaughter's birthday they offered to send the baby grand piano instead! It was actually slightly less expensive and got here right one time! The piano took only about 15 min. to put together and is beautiful! It is so lovely, in fact, that I left it in the living room and the grandbabies have easy access to it at all times! They completely enjoy the instrument and it sounds so nice that the adults enjoy it too! They are really getting the idea of playing already....my 18 mo. old grandson took a doll over and held it's hand while ""teaching"" it to play this weekend, then put it on the little bench and siddled in behind it to show it how he plays. The size is perfect for this age range and the grandchildren seem to have naturally good form while sitting and playing. I am absolutely happy with it and so are the children!"
1,*** Insert Roast's Name Here ***,Same old comedians telling the same old lame jokes. The only thing that changes is the person that is getting roasted.
2,Good band but they seem to repeat,"Hey I am a big fan of H.I.M. I have been for about three years, they're great. Though it's kind of boring to hear the same thing on each cd. I like the song rip out the wings of a beautiful and vampire heart but the rest just seem all the same, same tone, same massage, not difference. Still this cd is a good listen just as long as don't own all of their cds. If you want a good H.I.M. cd buy razorblade romance."
2,"2,5 stars",THis is definitely not one of their best albums (Love Metal + Razorblade Romance). THey have the same formula (sissy pseudo-gothic poser music) but they lack some good moments they have is their good albums. Personally i olny like the song : Rip out the wings of a butterfly. The other tracks are really really boring. Only for huge fans - and for little girls.
2,it the wrong ablum,"i have two thing to to said one dark light suck and love metal, razorblaze romance, and deep shaodows and billiant highlights are the best. the second is that HIM mean F%%KING HIM OK PEOPLE IT IS His Infernal Majesty"
4,heartagram,Wow. This cd is amazing! I absolutely love each song. Dark Light is the first cd I purchased from H.I.M. I'm very happy I bought it. And great quality as well.
4,"Great album, but not like the other HIM albums","This is the fifth HIM album with music and lyrics composed by Ville Valo.This record is really beautiful and it includes fantastic tracks like ''Vampire heart'',''Rip out the wings of a butterfly'',''Killing loneliness'',''Dark light'' and ''Play dead''.This album isn't much different from the previous ones, it has the same lyric style, it's melancholic and strong sometimes and it has also a mysterious epic melody.The only difference is the gothic element that is obviously more prominent than before.This release is one of the best of the year 2005, but unfortunately it can't beat the ohter HIM releases.However this disc forms a HIM release and that means it attracts by itself."
5,Perfect rating for the future kings of rock,"Like most HIM albums I own, I knew that I would probably have to listen to the album about 3 times before I could really give an accurate rating. Well, after about the third time through, my decision is in, 5/5 stars. HIM has done it again. If you're a HIM fan, go out and buy this album, and if you aren't yet a HIM fan, go out and buy this and all of their albums and jump on board with a truly amazing modern rock band. I'm not sure where this album ranks with the others, I love them all.Favorite songs:1.In the nightside of Eden (This song has grown on me so much, and will probably be my favorite song of the year.2.Vampire Heart3.Killing Lonliness"
1,ahahaha....,"this is a band for 13 year old wannabe goths. go ahead and paint your nails black and wear cheesy makeup and dream about your freaky girlfriend i dont care, but dont call this trash good music...its like emo-goth hahahago listen to paradise lost or katatonia if you want ""dark"" lol this sucks"
4,"A very good book, no latest Xe version&#65533;s OMW","This book is for the beginner and intermediate level developer, has a lot of sample and case study to help understanding OneWorld development tools. Some tips on Developer's Corner are very helpful. JDE OneWorld Xe version added a cool object management tool OMW, this book will be excellent if keeping update with Xe version."
4,Just read it,"I just saw these guys live and they're great. Just buy the album, it's a great addition to any punk collection."
5,This guy is vastly original and intelligent. Real fun.,"The first thing you notice when you get into this book, is that you can't read it fast enough. Each passage makes you want to know what is coming next. The author develops a personal voice without becoming focussed on himself, while taking the reader through Scotland and exploring the things that give his experiences meaning. It is funny, fantastic, intelligent and so cute. ..."
4,Attractive and it works,"I used this hub to attach a usb printer, cd-rw drive, and diskette drive to my new iBook, which had only one usb port. Everything worked well, the color of the hub matched the iBook, and the hub itself was unobtrusive on my desk."
1,"Nothing like Korman's ""Schooled"".","I did not enjoy ""Jake Reinvented"", and this is not based on a comparison of ""The Great Gatsby"" because I have yet to read that one. I found the characters in JR flat, some of the plot elements were not believable, and the Jake's ""secret"" was really no big deal. Also, there was no particular appeal for me in reading page after page of a teenage party scene - one where most of them are getting wasted.I may have been let down by JR because I so thoroughly enjoyed one of Korman's other books, ""Schooled"" - JR was no where, I mean NO WHERE near as enjoyable. Of course, this is all subjective, so give JR a try. You might like it."
3,It just gets worse as it progresses.,"At the begging it is very good seeing as the new guy of a sudden becomes the center of attention, but as the novel progresses it just becomes confusing and stupid. Some of it isn't even realistic it was ok but it just got worse as you read on"
3,Not great in the North,"Design Tech Solar Driveway Monitor and Vehicle Alert #33372Snow plowing prevents placing it as close as they recommend, when you place it farther away you have to set the sensitivity to the maximum. This causes a lot of false alarms whenever the wind blows. I do not recommend this unit unless you can place it as they recommend ( one foot from driveway )"
2,Disappointing,"Design Tech Solar Driveway Monitor and Vehicle Alert #33372It only works sometimes. I have tried all of the possible combinations of things that could possibly make it go off one time and not the next. Used it on the short post they provide, then put it 5 feet high on my post, then put it 3 feet high. Right side of the driveway, left side of the drive way.Sometimes it goes off 15-20 seconds after the car passes by. Once of twice a week it will go off with nothing around it. Says it has long range capability, but I'm afraid to put it past 150 feet ( with direct view ) with the problems it has. Very disappointed with it."
5,Impressive work,"You can tell the director's spent a great deal of time and energy in researching this topic. Although this movie is focused primarily in NY, this occurs in every asian culture around the US, even here in TX. The movie does a great job showing the behind-the-scenes view of what really goes on in these parties that most people don't realize. It was an eye-opener and made me sympathize with the main characters struggle in life and acceptance. I look forward to the director's future projects..."
2,Compromised Missal,"This Missal is compromised to conform to the post Vatican II new age changes.Pretty much clear fact by now that the Freemasons took over the Vatican, instituted slowly evolving changes, and finally compromised Truth to make things more easy to conjoin with the heretical beliefs of the Protestants.This Missal constitutes one more milestone on the road to the gradual change that leads to the novus ordo and later One World Religion. Don't believe me? Go to You Tube and Listen for Father Malachi Martin, former Jesuit priest and Vatican insider, who wrote Windswept House, Keys to This Blood and a number of other seminal works.I recommend you look for the 1947 version of the Father Lasance Missal. Nothing else will do, if you want to claim to be traditional...."
5,Excellent inspirational and motivating book,"Sonia Choquette has written a very inspiring book that offers intriguing excercises. I normally hate to write in a book ( ingrained manners!) but this book motivated me to meditate, reflect and write, then write some more! The concept that my hearts desire was within my grasp always seemed like such a fantasy but Sonia has made it a goal within my reach. I will most certainly be recomending this book to my friends,"
3,"Good cover, not great",Phone cover was not what I expected from the picture. Super fast shipping though.
2,"A Joyless, Forced Read","I just finished reading The Thrawn Trilogy, and I'm so glad I'm done. I forced my way through pretty much the whole thing, just because I had heard and read for so long that it was so great. Well, it isn't even mediocre. The characters are dull, Zahn gets too caught up describing military maneuvers and technology, and the main villain (Thrawn) over and over and over again just figures out exactly what his opponents are going to do without any real data or clues. There's no real, true tension, and there's no mythology at all. Just stay away from these overrated books."
5,6 STARS OUT OF 5; TIMOTHY ZAHN MUST BE GEORGE LUCAS'S CLONE,"This book is the ABSOLUTE BEST book I've ever read!! It is a epic conclusion to the Thrawn Trilogy and probably a secret script taken from George Lucas!!If you see one movie this year, see STAR WARS: PHANTOM MENACE!!If you read only one book series this year, READ THE THRAWN TRILOGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Build up your wrist muscles.,"Okay, so this is my first time owning a stylus. I bought it to use in conjunction with my iPad, which is also my first. Anyway, this stylus is nice, as long as you press hard enough, which can be exhausting. After getting used to using it, I find that I have the knack of it and don't have to push as hard. HOWEVER. The little silver rim around the tip of the pen is DANGEROUS to your screen. Thank GOD I bought a case with a screen protector, because if you angle the stylus too much, it scratches very easily. I scratched it twice. It kind of sucks that my screen protector is scratched but hey, at least it's not the iPad. As long as you use this product carefully, it's a nice little stylus. Definitely not for kids to use, if you value the well-being of your screen or otherwise."
2,"GREAT hardware, horrid software (even recent v3.0!!!)","The hardware is amazing. Nothing to gripe about at all. It sounds good, is durable, gets great battery life, etc. I was hoping that the SonicStge 3.0 would take care of some of the problems that plagues the earlier releases, however this is not the case. The software is incredibly slow and hard to use especially if you have a large collection of music. It seems to have to redo the entire database every time I make one small change. I am incredibly dissapointed. The hardware would get 5 stars, the software gets -3."
4,Accurate yet misleading,"This book is an astute critique of some of the naive and even undemocratic tendencies in Deep Ecology. But it is unfair to associate Deep Ecology with fascism without pointing out that fascism has other political heirs far more powerful than any ecologist.The book leaves you feeling the author prefers needling theories to grappling with the ecological crisis in its true depth. This can't be done from the calculative, rationalist basis he finds comfortable. If Deep Ecology needs a new basis, Ferry gives few clues what that might be and settles instead for enlightened smugness."
1,Terrible leaking problem & terrible customer service,I have always bought Mr. Coffee & have always had problems. This is no different. After a while it leaks out the bottom. This is our 3rd one this one is as bad as the other two. Customer service was no help at all. Borderline rude & pretty much call us liars. I will be throwing out this maker & telling friends & family not to buy Mr. Coffee. I'm going to try another brand and I don't know why it took me this long to see a substandard product and stop buying from them.
1,Broke in less than 3 months,"We bought this coffee maker after having several Cuisinarts that broke down. We decided to buy an inexpensive one since none of the coffee makers seem to last anymore but really, we had no idea it would break this fast. We have had it less than 3 months. This morning my husband turned the pot on and even though the light came on no water dripped down and the unit did not heat. Unfortunately for us we couldn't find our receipt. Lesson to all - save receipt for the life of the warranty. I will never buy a Mr. Coffee again. We are all adding to the land-fill daily by buying these products which are made so faulty. I'm trying to find a coffee maker not made in China. Is this an impossible feat? I hope not. I'm sick of throwing coffee makers away."
1,My Mr. Coffee Leaked Too,I bought this unit because it was inexpensive. We use it to heat water for tea or for use in a coffee press. I noticed the strange leaking soon after the purchase. The leak is a brown liquid that originates from somewhere under the unit and occurs without rhyme or reason. Another flaw became evident upon my first attempt at a full pot of coffee; water spills onto the counter through curious port holes in the water chamber. The heating element stopped working yesterday. I'm shopping for a new coffee maker and attempted to purchase the same unit so I would have an extra carafe around the house. I changed my mind; that machine was a mess.
1,Poor Design,"I bought this cheap little pot for the times when the good pot wore out. I stored it after it was bought and got it out when my other coffee maker died last week. I have tried to make coffee with this pot all week thinking it just must be the way I was using it. But I have come to the conclusion that this coffee pot is so poorly designed that no one could make coffee with it. You actually have to pick up the basket for the coffee to run into the pot! Otherwise, you have bitter coffee and a huge mess! Grounds everywhere! I will be contacting the company about this but wanted to warn other users how bad it can be!"
1,drop this course,"I purchased ""Physics : A World View"" for a physics class freshman year. As soon as I opened the book I knew I had made a mistake in choosing my professor. Anyone who would assign a book that manages to be simultaneously pedantic and unintelligible is unworthy of teaching college students. This book contains complex concepts without the benefit of explanations or narratives of the scientific processes leading up to the concept. The reader is expected to learn physics by rote. I recommend leaving the book on the shelf and changing courses."
1,The worst book a have ever read in my entire life.,"I cannot believe that this is me who can't follow any single chapter of this book. I am an A/B student (as a matter of fact, recently was accepted to UCLA)and It is so freaking hard to understand what these men(Kirkpatrick-Francis)wrote in there. It seems that they themselves have a little idea what is going on in the world of physics. Their explanations are so confusing and often seem incomplete. Even my physics teacher mentioned it in class that these guys seem to misunderstand some topics of physics (it was chapter 13-14). Anyway, if you have any other option besides this book go and buy other book!"
3,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"Bought this for someone else...was not that impressed with the stage presence of the four men; however, their singing IS awesome, so the DVD is worth it for the music. The women in the audience seemed to love them, and I guess if you're a big fan of groups like this, it would be a great DVD. I know the person I work with loves these guys. I'm more into Johnny Clegg and Savuka, myself."
3,Better Than the First,"I gave the first Anna Strong book a terrible review, but with 3 stars, because ... Well ... It was pretty terrible. But Stein redeemed herself with this one. Still can't give it 4 stars because I felt like the main plot was simply dragging along at a snails pace (and because I've read books 10 times better that were not as predictable). I actually had to stop myself (multiple times) from skipping whole chapters to get moving a little faster.1 star because there's no sex scenes, only elaborate phrasing that basically tells you 'they had great sex.'2 stars because of the plot (even though it was slow moving).3 stars because I'm still intrigued by Casper."
3,urban fantasy,This a continuation of The Becoming where Anna Strong and her world is fleshed out. She is a great deal like Anita Blake in Laurell K. Hamilton's series in that she is still conflicted in her life. If she faces the supernatural world realistically and squares it with trying to live a contuation of her mortal life I may purchase her third in the series. One Anita Blake is enough.
5,Simply Adorable,This is one piece of a two piece purchase and is simply adorable. My daughter has a 2.7 lb. spoiled little girl. Nina loves this little sweater and all the other clothes that were purchased for her. Thank you!
4,great escargot plate - you can also use it for lobster bites,"I like this product and I prefer the version made out of white china to the stainless steel. The price is great, the only thing I do not like that it is made in China (we simply import too much from there and the other reason is that I am afraid with Chinese products that there are problems like with the Chinese drywall or toys, otherwise I would have given it five stars). You can not only use it with snails, but also for lobster bites, shrimp, large scallops, etc. Cut a lobster tail into small pieces and cook them in butter with herbs, sea salt, a lot of freshly minced garlic, and herbs (or use scallops and large peeled shrimp). Warm the plates in the oven and place the lobster bites and cover them with the garlic butter. Serve with French bread."
5,"Great product, but not what I'm looking for","I thought this was the temp sensor fan switch, but not... It'll not fit on your galant 2000 ES temp sensor fan switch hole, but will fit on the temp sender hole (in the engine). I tested this sensor with a multimeter and its quite sensitive: the resistance vary instanly with the heat of my hand.!"
3,The old grey mare...,"I wanted to replace my old, identical thermometer (and clock) which, after many years of accuracy and function, had broken (my fault). The first thermometer did not register anywhere close to the accurate temperature, so I exchanged it. Promptly got a new one, and I question whether or not it is reading cool. Still, it's beautiful, and I guess warmer weather will tell if it's accurate or not."
2,"they are ""okay""","They are only cardboard circles, and usually have to be thrown out after 1 use, so to save a little money I just traced the size on a piece of paper and cut it to fit the wax, and it works just the same."
4,Deadly Obsession,I enjoyed this. The thriller content was very good but I'm afraid the romance and sex content was a bit over the top but I just skipped these and enjoyed the rest very much. I would recomment this and other Kinnaid Brothers in the series.
1,Don't buy this printer!,"This printer binds up on two pieces of paper! If there is the least resistance during a jam, the flimsy plastic gears become stripped and the printer is trash. This is what happened to me after less than two months of light use...and I stayed within the manufacturer's guidelines. However, there is NO WARRANTEE on this printer, so BUYER BEWARE."
4,word!,"this movie was intense. there is so much meaning and so much absurdity to it. bt fernando arrabel is def. on eof the best and unique filmmakers out there. his visions ans representation of these visions, are unmistakably one of a kind! if u ove freaky films in general, or a film enthusiest, watch this movie!"
1,Disappointed with product,"We have a 6 month old pit-bull that barks often at night when left alone. We purchased this item and tried it for at least two weeks. This item never worked. We tried to change the settings but there was no success. Perhaps this product will work for someone else but it did not work for us. Luckily, I was able to return the item for a refund. I can only say, ""Buyers beware."""
1,Intellipet Bark Solver,This bark solver worked well but I'm afraid our two shihtzus disregarded the high pitched sound completely. So back to the drawing board.
3,"Very good, could have been better.","I love dancing to it and singing also, but I think they should have added more songs, like ""On the Good Ship Lollipop""(from Bright Eyes), ""Oh My Goodness""(from Poor Little Rich Girl), and ""Bluebird""(from Dimples)."
3,Not the greatest...,"This video is very different...it isn't a Shirley Temple movie. It is a recent video; a collection of some of Shirley's songs. They have added other children's voices to the original songs and this totally spoils them! Another thing...I know that every review mentions this, but I still can't believe that this video doesn't even feature ""ON THE GOOD SHIP LOLLIPOP""! Personally, I think this is just another scam to make money off Shirley collectors, who will buy anything as long as it has anything to do with Shirley Temple. One can always buy a Shirley CD, or go to the website: Shirley Temple-The World's Darling and listen to her songs on the postcard page for free! Well, if you are a serious collector, go ahead...but if you are a fan of the movies, leave this on the shelf and pick something else!"
5,An Excellent Personal Resource!,This book has been an eye-opener to reveal how to focus in on your personal goals and future. I wish there would have been a class that taught this in high school or college. There would be less floundering around and more lives lived fulfilling true destinies. Obviously I recommend this book. I was also please with my order through amazon as I had the book in hand 2 days after ordering it. Thanks!
1,"No book, no reply",Item was ordered Sept 30. E-mail requesting status is still unanswered and the book has not arrived as of Nov 3.
4,Excellent.. easy to read and understand.,"I found the tutorials easy, none of them actually took me an hour to get through. I knew nothing about HTML, and yet I had my web page published over a weekend. The free Claris Home Page software was easy to install and use... I would recommend this title to anyone wanting to try building a page."
3,Smaller than advertised....,"It's hard to fit a size 15. These claimed to do the job, but they don't. They are very stylish and comfortable, until they are washed for the first time, then they don't fit anymore..."
3,What happened to the girls,Where did the picnic occure? How many girls are missing? What date did the picnic occure?Where can I get more info on this subject?
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Don Delillo and can usually defend him against most accusations of pretentiousness, unbelievable plots and dialogue and one dimensional characters. But I'm afraid I cannot defend him against these accusations with regards to Valparaiso. Perhaps as a performance - it is afterall written to be performed - I would view it differently - but I don't think so. Valparaiso is not a good story, it is not a good play - Chuck Palahniuk's Survivor is far more successful at dealing with similar themes and it's that book which I recommend."
1,Don't Waste your Money!,I've been using rotary shavers for the last 40 years and Remington for the last 10. I received the 5130 as Christmas gift last year. Within 6 months the cutter heads started falling out. Remington replaced it with a 7130 which lasted about 4 months before it developed the same problem. The flex 360 is the worst design and poorest made razor system I have ever encountered. When I contacted Remington about the failure of the second razor they told me where I could buy parts. Their 2 year warranty is a JOKE!I have a 5 year old Remington #845 micro flex that is still a better razor than any of their current models.
5,It's a beauty,"It was expensive but I have tried several less expensive razors and they were lousy.This razor is terrific, it shaves close, as good as the straight razor, is very comfortable and gets it tight spots.Have had it for couple months and would certainly recommend it to everybody."
4,joe lenzen,"I am very pleased with this shaver. I was previously using a Wahl brand, but this is much easier to handle and seems to be more solidly built."
5,Extraordinary,"This is, without a doubt, the most extraordinary book on food and gastronomy ever. Brilliantly written, a true snapshot in time."
5,As advertised,"Clock looks good and keeps good time. No problems with buyer, shipped promptly.I would recommend this to someone looking for a good outdoor clock."
2,Don't bother,"This book not contain much useful information. What's more, it's structured very poorly and what little value the book does contain is hard to extract. Read Baird's Engineering Your Start-Up and Nesheim's High Tech Startup instead."
1,Misled by all the positive reviews,"I bought this book based upon the positive reviews I read on this site. I was sorely disappointed. This book is inane and borders on the insulting to the informed reader. Worse, it is misleading to the uninformed reader. Pity the poor entrepreneur who approaches a professional investor spouting the trade-marked nonsense espoused in this book."
1,Not useful - buy something else,"While there are a few interesting tidbits of information in it, pass this one by. I've never seen a book before with so many trademarked phrases and words. The ""TM"" appears on almost every page, and often many times on a page. Phrases like ""Investor Financing (TM)"" and ""Capital Relations (TM)"" appear so often as to distract. This book is excellent at showing someone how to use the superscript ""TM"" symbol religiously.The content of this book is complicated, and the complex process they suggest is generally impractical to use in any way. Perhaps the partners at the author's investment company are skilled at facilitating such a process, but I believe the ""K.I.S.S."" technique (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is more likely to get you financed rather than this unusual process."
2,Cleaning Tape,"This was a complete waste of my money. Made no difference to the picture, it's still unwatchable. Save your money."
1,8 mm Head Cleaner,Outrageous price and did not solve my problem.But the 8mm system is very outdated and I neededhelp in trying to convert my old 8mm tapes toDVD. Would love to be able to return the product.
2,the videos looks worse now...,"I dont know why, i follow exactly the instructions but when I playback my videos the image was worse than before...."
2,"Steer Clear, unless you're a hard-core fan!",This is a badly recorded and produced CD. You can do better.
2,Not worth it,"Ms. Weber is considered a fine player of Liszt's works, and her technique is indeed strong. I did not like her overly emotional interpretations, however, and for that reason I would not buy this early recording of hers."
1,Less than 'intelligent',"This product cannot differentiate between barking and other noise. I have problems with planes and wind-related noise activating it, even on the low sensitivity and multiple bark settings. If you live in a neighborhood with other noises, this product is probably not right for you and your dog."
1,Bark Solver? Not for Me,"Purchased this to assist in quieting down a neighborhood dog. Several problems with this device. Any noise will set it off, so if a tree limb makes a noise, the device goes off, even if the dog is being silent. They admit this in their literature. So the dog doesn't correlate the noise with the barking any longer, he doesn't know what is happening. Secondly, even when it goes off it doesn't phase the dog at all. But think about it, if someone said, I have a powerful sound blaster that will really annoy the humans next door, it will stop them in their tracks. Then said ""Just let me hook it up to these 4 tiny D batteries"", you would laugh at them. But here we expect the same thing for an aggressive dog. There was an initial effect, i think the dog was just curious. But after a few days it wore off and the dog just assumed that noise was natural. Now he barks like before. Sorry, it didn't work for me."
3,works ok,Worked fine on noisey neighbors dog as long as the wind was not blowing then no matter what setting i set it to it went off. But it does quiet barking dogs.
3,no answers to questions,"Got 1/2 order and had to e-mail 6 times & still no answer.2 wks. later got a phone call ""agreeing"" w/my complaint.Finally, they made the deal whole. Not good business tactics."
5,Art & Fear,"A thoughtful and insightful guide to dealing with the various twists and turns of making art: from dealing with inner fears about success (or failure), how to keep doing art when others are critical of your style, how to get the most out of going to art school, and much more. A sweet little book to refer to when the going gets rough and you need someone to believe in you!"
3,If you need to be coddled...,"ART AND FEAR, is a very good self help and motivational book. It's an easy read; you'll most likely finish it in one day. Because of its length I would recommend it to anyone. Short and sweet, how can you get hurt?What you'll find in these pages are things you already know. You know that art making is hard and that it takes hard work to get by. These authors are warm and have a great way of coddling their reader and letting them know it's a hard thing to be creative and that it takes self motivation and drive.If you are in need a reminder, this is the book for you."
5,An Unlikely Discovery,"I've read the other reviews.Last Saturday, Lizzie (10) and I went to the art store with a gift certificate and she was heavily lobbying me for clay - which she got. In the meantime, this book was laying askew on a shelf. I picked it up as a diversion - and became captivated by it. The authors have assembled a distillate of their time and experience. And it resonates so well with mine. And the ideas they provide are not limited to art - they are also important to the modern applications of science which are becoming ever mre individually-oriented and therefore closer to art than perhaps science has ever been. Craft and art are merging.I finished this book with the same feeling as I had when I read Walden. Utter simplicity, utter verity, utter thanks.I'd like to meet these authors and enjoy a conversation with them."
3,Not Helpful To Me,"I couldn't get into this book after reading through half of it. It didn't give me much to latch on to, and that may be because I am a casual art hobbyist. I didn't feel it translated to my experience very well, but I am giving it to someone who may find it helpful."
5,A Must for the Serious Artist!,"I have read this book twice now, and have found new meaning to further questions that I had the second time through. I highly recommend this book to those who are seeking truths to inner questions they have about the purpose of their art and what is keeping them from furthering their art-making. I have also taken a full semester photo class from Ted Orland and highly recommend this master photographer's books and classes/workshops. Read his books and gain new insight in your art-making skills."
4,"Quick read ""Time Travel""","Don't let the cover turn you away from this book. It should have an old mansion with a conservatory filled with blooming malmaison carnations. I enjoyed Ginny traveling to the present time 1999 and seeing how her family estate had changed. Sam Sutter could have been a more steamer lover; but he is a research scientist looking for medical cures through flowers. Ginny travels to the 1999 from 1899 on New Years Eve. Her husband has just commited suicide, because he has gone through all of Ginny's family money and even the family estate. Ginny knows the man responsible for her husbands death is Colonel Sutter."
5,"Leonardo, the Terrible Monster",the illustrations and the typography are amazing. and of course the story is alot of fun as well.
1,"Failed very early on, not for working moms","I purchased this pump before I had the baby, so it sat in the box for a few months. I started pumping when my daughter was just a few days old, and within a week the motor stopped pumping. Kudos to the service rep - she was friendly and I had a new motor in two days. A few weeks later, however, the new motor began to stutter. I was still on leave at the time, so it wasn't a HUGE deal, but I was very disappointed. I ended up investing in a Medela PISA, and it was well worth it.I guess my bottom line is this: If you're looking for a pump that you can depend on, don't get this one. If you just need something to pump for an occasional night out without the baby, it might work."
3,Cover is too big and made in China.,The one I bought from army universe was too big. The cover was way too big for the canteen and was also made in China. Not something you would expect from a surplus store.
5,Amazing epic! Get it while you still can!,"It's not completely out of print! Yes! This is considered by many THE version of Les Troyens to own. I agree. The cast is amazing and the sound is very good. Each time I listen to this set, I'm touched by the amount of dedication to this oft neglected opera. Lightning was caught in a bottle during this performance, and its sparkling beauty deserves your attention. Hear it while it's still available!"
5,French Blockbuster,Les Troyens is a French blockbuster!! It is as long as Wagner's Die Meistersingers. Magnificent music and a stunning realization of the genius of Berlioz. It is a compulsory purchase for all opera lovers.
4,Really a Vegan Cookbook,"Very good, healthy VEGAN recipes. You won't find any animal products here. I'm looking forward to improving my overall health with diet changes in the new year."
4,"decent book, not what i ordered","The book is what I needed for class and satisfies all requirements, but the amazon add said that it was to be hardcover and I received a soft covered two part book. It is easy to carry around, but not hardcover as expected."
5,Very pleased.,I am very please with the quick response from Breaktimebooks. I ordered a book with pages missing but wasn't aware until weeks later. When I notified Breaktimebooks they quickly refunded my payment without the book having to be returned.I will continue to order my books from Breaktimebooks. I'm very pleased with the high quality service I received!
3,"Yes, There is Sound","I had ordered this particular device because I wanted to be able to convert home movies to my computer in the mpeg format. As I had read above in another review it said there was no sound but there is sound-you just need a cable that plugs into your soundcard. The quality it puts out is about what you expect for the price. Decent. If you are planning on making quality home movies for CD I would invest a little more money. However if you just want to make decent quality video clips for emailing or sharing with your friends, then this is a nice toy."
5,Beautiful Watch,"I bought this watch to replace a Timex I have been wearing for at least 15 yeats on a daily basis. It finally just quit ""ticking"". This watch is a tad dressier, and I love its bracelet styling. Another feature that I particularly appreaciated was how easy it was to adjust its size. It was too large for my wrist, but there was absolutely no problem removing a link from the bracelet band to make it smaller. I have been wearing it daily for a month now and have had no problems or concerns with its performance or appearance."
2,"Color not golden, more like white gold","This is a very nice watch and looks pretty, however the watch is not golden in color but more like white gold (maybe it was just the one I got, not really sure). The color was unacceptable. Shipping and packing was great, and Amazon Prime returns were easy, hassle free. Great service by Amazon. Just disappointed with the color or the watch would have been perfect."
5,Excellent Cat-back exhaust,I have an 05 Silverado and wanted to upgrade my exhaust. All I can say is that you wont be disappointed when purchasing this awesome Magnaflow cat-back exhaust system. Def. a must if your looking for the best you can get along with the best sounding muffler out there. +++
4,"Enjoyable book, Details don't always hang together","I enjoy mysteries with sleuths who are realistic. I am always scavenging leaves for my compost pile so I really relate to Louise Eldridge's leaf-collecting methods. This book is obviously written by a true gardener. I thought the plot was good and I enjoyed reading the book. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because details don't always fit together and that is an irritation. For example, Louise painstakingly monitors every word she says to neighbors so noone will know her husband is a CIA spook. But she feels it is OK to get publicly drunk and be hypnotized which would both be situations where secrets slip. If a few inconsistencies in the characters don't bother you, especially if you are a gardener or composter, read the book."
5,This is the One,"Can't recommend this enough, one of the most moving pieces of music I've ever experienced. The closest description I've heard from anyone I've played it for is ""it feels like you're drowning, but it's okay"". This disc is my favorite, particularly the track entitled 6. The track does not disintegrate in the style of many of the others in this series, but the timber of the sound does shift due to the flaking of the Oxide.If you have even the slightest interest in experimental music this is an essential for your collection."
2,Very disappointing.,"Spoilers warning.Yet another in a line of recent ""sequels"" to Pride and Prejudice where the author is overly familiar with the Firth/Ehle made for tv miniseries, and apparently not familiar enough with the original novel.Aside from the utterly ridiculous plot twists and total breaks in character throughout this novel (Lady Catherine bribing Wickham to run off with a Bennet daughter in order to ruin the family in Darcy's eyes??!!), one of my main problems is with the utter lack of proper editing. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes abound. (And I am sorry, but continually spelling ""choose"" as ""chuse"" or ""show"" and ""shew"" does not turn a modern novel into something of the Regency period.)If you are looking for a more-Austenesque novel to read, try Janet Aylmer's Darcy's Story or Julia Barrett's Presumption.(Of course, this book is head and shoulders superior to the utterly vile ""Bar Sinister"".)"
2,This book is pretty bad,"This is not a good book. Based on the plot and characters of Austen's original P&P, the storylines are positively unbelievable and over the top (as noted in detail by other reviewers). As for style, I don't understand why the author continually puts two or three sentences in a paragraph, then simply puts a comma between each sentence so they all run together. My edition is brand new, but some paragraphs were intermittently printed in a larger font than the rest (?)Also it was humorous that where Austen originally left it to the reader to divine subtle points about her characters' personalities and traits, Shapiro comes right out and tells what the trait is. In case you didn't know Mr. Collins is a buffoon, she will state it in plain English for you. Kind of like telling a joke and then explaining the punch line.Overall the book was mildly entertaining if you have nothing else to read and can't get enough of Austen sequels."
1,Not very good...,I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I can't recomend this book.
3,Good Sex Comedy,"This was a good sex comedy starring some of the better up and comming talent like Jerry O'Connell. I rented this video, because Alyssa Milano was in it. In this case it was dissappointing since she only had two small scenes. But, she has other movies such as ""Embrace of the Vampire"" which is excellent. ""Buying the Cow"" was in no means a waste of money. It was a good video. that is why i gave it 3 stars.."
4,Stupid fun and has a positive message to boot!,"This movie is unoriginal, mindless, and completely stupid. Now that we have that out of the way, run out and watch this movie now! I'm serious, if you can get over the ""bad"" movie factor and just relax for five minutes you will enjoy this film. It is truly one of the great ""bad"" movies out there, perfect for a Sunday afternoon.Have a beer, get over the cliches, the stereotypes, and sexist attitudes. At the end of the day, this movie has a truly positive message. Through all the BS that the sexes go through and put each other through, we all really are desperately seeking ""true love."" A chance to find that special someone that for some unknown reason just feels right in all possible ways. Sure, the movie's completely unrealistic, but there are plenty of laughs along the way and it at least reassures us that there really is true love out there, even if the movie is just a hollywood cliche."
4,Funny movie,"It's a funny movie, and without going in to too much detail I will say, while Alyssa Milano was quite gorgeous, I am very angry the scenes in the menu and on the back of the DVD apparently never actually happen.Other than that, great movie. Acting is decent, movie is hilarious, the plot is kinda ... weak, but still good."
4,If you liked Tomcats...,"And I liked Tomcats in all its pure cheesiness, then you too will enjoy Buying the Cow. It is a bit far-fetched, but if you're in the mood for mindless entertainment to take you away after a horrible day of work, this flick will do the trick. Also, if you like Ryan Reynolds, he's hilarious in this. As a side note to the other ladies, you get to see him naked which is always a wonderful plus in my book. He looks gorgeous! Jerry O'Connell's character seems very similar to that of his character in Tomcats, but he's still great fun. Another thing I really liked was how they showed Jerry O'Connell's meeting in the airport with the girl of his dreams from his point of view as well as later on in the film, from her point of view. I thought that was a nice touch. Though certainly quite far from the best movie I've ever seen, for the price (found it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart) it's a great addition to any DVD collection."
2,Does not work on all discs,This item was returned soon after purchase. My wife tried it on the blank cd's we use and it did not work. Apparantly it only works on certain types of discs and we found that to be an inconvienence.
3,Not quite what we expected,"We were a little disappointed because the silhouette effect was not as striking as we expected--the darker part of the background is lighter than we expected. This is, however, a very well made shirt that will last a long time. No other problems with order."
2,Too tight for breacher barrel,Really just another cool dress up item as I hope I'm never pumping enough shells to need a heat shield. I bought this to dress up my 500 with a breacher barrel and really had to tweak it to get it over the barrel.
3,Whats going on?,"Vail is by far my favorite author. What went wrong with this book? Its very well written but I the whole time Zoe is tense and completely changed from her old character. I loved the fun, careless Zoe who wore baggy shirts and attracted Tommy. Now it seems she'll do whatever it takes to make CJ or Tommy or Morgan happy, and I think this character is shallow. The whole book was worrying. I still think it is worth reading, though, to see what is going on with all the friends. But don't expect this book to be your favorite out of the friendship ring."
5,This was the best one,"This was my favorite book out of the whole series, because I like Zoe and 'cause this book wasn't like the others. All the other books are like just about the same story but being told by different characters. Rachel Vail is one of my favorite authors. You should get this book."
3,If you like folk music...,"Songcatcher is directed by Maggie Greenwald and stars JAnet McTeer and Aidan Quinn. It tells the story of a musicologist (McTeer) who goes to record the Scottish and Irish folksongs that the locals have preserved for generations. But she soon finds herself getting involved in other ways, including helping them with their struggles with the coal mining companies, and the friend she finds in a local musician (Quinn).I liked the actors, especially Janet McTeer who gives a very believable performance. I always believed that Aidan Quinn is one of the most underrated performers of our time. He also does a solid job here.Overall, it's the music that sells here. If you like folk music you might wanna see it. It may not be as interesting as that for others who don't like it."
1,Songcatcher?,"If you want a movie to reflect a book - this is NOT it! I was never so disappointed in my life! The book, by Sharon McCrumb, is a brilliant story and this movie does not, in the least reflect that story. I was so disappointed by what the filmakers did that I want to share that. It is most insulting to a wonderful story/writer. If I were Ms. McCrumb, I would suit for defamation of character!"
2,Story too complicated -- didn't match the simple music,"Overall, I didn't like this movie. I appreciated the music and the photography, and the acting was fine, but the screenplay should have been written more simply. The story should have been about the unexpected music and the unexpected change in the heroine's life, instead of being so much concerned with homosexuality, evil corporate industrialists, and adultry. The music in the film can touch people in a universal way, but the film loses something when it starts trying to cover so many non-universal things.The movie had some nice moments -- especially the lovely music and the sad young love story -- but it failed to suspend my disbelief because it was trying to do so much. Overall, seeing this movie left me feeling kind of queasy. It took me places I didn't really want to go at the time, which detracted from the lovely feelings which the music and main storyline could have left me with."
2,"Beautiful Music, great idea, pendantic drivel","Love the idea of this movie, but I completely agree with the people who have pointed out that it is is a series of smug sermons on the injustices of the past. Yes, mountain people were exploited and women were oppressed but in this movie they all have great skin, teeth and access to hair mousse. I was especially irked with the scene where the two women were caught kissing in the woods. Lesbians or ""spinsters"" from that era would never, ever ever have taken such a risk because they knew the terrible consequences if they were caught. That's opression for you. This movie (despite a great effort from the cast) was contrived and patronizing - even though I agree with most of its politics. If you want to immerse yourself in the culture, just get the Songcatcher II CD. Those who voted for this at sundance were probably voting for the music and the message, not the movie."
3,research angle best part,"I purchased this movie hoping to show it to my students as it the subject matter is so interesting. The material on collection of songs, the challenges to women academics and the hard life of the creative mountain musicians was spectacular. Few cameo appearances by real Appalachian musicians were worth the price of the DVD. I was disappointed in the typical Hollywood angles on violence, gay relationships and hillbilly hard drinking. Seemed like they stuck it in to have something steamy to sell the movie. So, I couldn't show it to my students."
3,NOt nearly as bad as other reviewers say,"I watched this movie on the WB, I believe, it was on last night and had to suffer through lots of commercials. It is not nearly as bad as the other reviewers here have pegged it. Of course, I just knew the twist at the end was coming. Anyway, the scenery is great and makes you want to go down there to Brazil on a boat trip."
2,"""ET,phone home!""","Yes,that's Henry Thomas,the kid from ""ET:The Extra Terrestrial"",as part of a love triangle involving Dominique Swain,her boyfriend&a; cute(?) Brazilian guy dealing with murder,jealousy&angst.;As would be expected,most of the action takes place on the water.Dominique Swain plays a rich heiress who flirts with cute(?)Brazilian guy,angering her boyfriend.Her boyfriend pushes the Brazilian overboard--who,it turns out,can't swim.Confusions ensue.Swain seems intent on killing her boyfriend,while discussing capitalism&all; her $$$$$ with Henry Thomas.Though I am a fan of Brazilian music,I don't remember the soundtrack for this movie.It's all about three troubled rich kids on a yacht.And they are very,very,very confused."
5,Let there be light....,Why a high-end SUV like the Toyota FJ Cruiser has no map lights is beyond me. I bought one of these and it does the job and does it well. I clipped it on the driver's side visor of my FJ and it completely lights up the center console. I'm going to order another one for the other visor. The light is very bright and the clips seems very strong and well made.
5,Perfection,I bought 2 of these for my work truck that lacks sufficient lighting when writting invoices at night with the standard light in the cab. Now I can see what i am writting and also dont have a huge shadow of my hand in the way now. Bought the second one for the passenger side so i dont have to keep turning the overhead light on when my helper is looking for something in the book.
4,Surprisingly good,Picked this up just to check out the 5.1 mix. I was really surprised how good the music was. The mix is good as well. Well worth picking up cheap also this appears to be the only source. No CD release best I can tell. But doable with this version of course.
5,It's Perfect!,This is a super cute shaker for my drum circles. Adults and Kids alike can use this. Love the design. I might buy another in the near future. Since everyone loves the one I have.
2,wrong item for my vehicle,Specs were a little off according to the dealer. Could be wrong information from dealer also.
4,"Private lives in Renaissance Venice: Art, Architecgture, and family",A very well documented book with a deep knowledge of the social conditions of Venice in the Renaissance period it covers. I found it a little bit dense sometimes. The illustrations are good. Hector Cardenas
1,A Poor Choice,"Having become interested in metaphysical advancement, I stumbled across the interesting concept of DNA Activation. Thus I began my search for resources that could help me do this, and my search led me to this book.I was quite disapointed with this book, for one main reason: it's a selling point for a larger 'kit'. The book describes how to do 1st and 2nd DNA Activation, but in order to do the recommended 3rd and 4th Strand Activation, you have to spend a hundred bucks to get the information. [...]Place this on top of the many spelling and punctuation errors, and it adds up to a book not really worth the paper it's printed on. I recommend avoiding this book."
5,Wonderful,"I don't often write little music reviews, but Cat Power is an exception. This is a great album. It is the sort of album to which you can turn the lights off and just listen to the rain. If people feel they can call Tim Kinsella (JOA) a genius, then surely this title can apply to Chan Marshall. She is a master of minimalism; a gifted creator of stark, shadowed musical landscapes"
5,"Indeed, the best cd of 1998","As I hear albums, the quality of a sit down listen is in fact the most appealing quality. ""Moon Pix"" sets the mood, and holds the listener, while the intellectually pleasing tone of Chan Marshall's voice hold you captive at your own will."
2,Most overated record of the year,"I bought this record after it appeared on numerous ""best of"" lists for 1998 but I'm less than impressed. The mood is there but the song writing is weak. ""Metal Heart"" is the exception and hints at great things to come if she concentrates more on the tunes."
3,Good - but...,"A very nice book with good data and photos - however strictly of British nature i.e. measurements, terminology, even colours are given with the British colour names only. Still worth having if you are a 911 owner or fan."
2,okay I guesse!,The book wasn't all that great but it also wasn't horrible.Basically it's about a girl who wants to lose a few pounds to get a guy to notice her.Soon her losing a fewpounds becomes an obsession and she gets to be anorexic.This book could be a mind changer for anyone who's thinking of starving themselves but it will never become a life saver.Not to be mean or anythig but if the author was trying to teach young girls a lesson she totally could have done better!
5,Vicente,"What more can I say about Vicente's movies? Other than They are GREAT MOVIES. He sing awesome, is good looking, and my residents love him."
3,Acorn corbel,I ordered 2 pieces of this corbel. Both of the corbels got little cut in the detail area. I think it was cut when the person was carving it. This does happen sometimes in many corbels or Onlays.
5,A Must Read,"For anyone raising, teaching or otherwise involved in the care of kids with ADD/ADHD, this book is a ""must read."" As with any text, not every suggestion works for every reader, but those that do evoke amazing success."
5,top murder mystery and every episode 5 star worthy,"Television's most murderous county is Midsomer, England, and the show has been solving multiple murders in episodes for over a decade. John Nettles, Midsomer's DCI Tom Barnaby, is the cop leading the investigation team. Expect some smiles (& LOL), a touch of romance, some awesome scenic footage of beautiful village life in England, of course crime mystery, some blood-but not too much, and a sensational support cast with always the sub-plots through relationships. If you are new to Midsomer Murders, they are based on books by Caroline Graham. And many leading British guest stars, as huge stars beg to be on an episode to kill or be killed.I have never watched a less-than GREAT episode of Midsomer Murders."
4,a near-definitive biography...,"I only wish this volume was longer and more detailed. Even so, Schatzkin has done an excellent job in covering the breadth of Farnsworth's life -- not just the battle for television, but his never-realized battle for successful fusion power as well. Even Godfrey's scholarly opus barely covers this latter phase of his life, which makes ""The Boy Who Invented Telelvision"" a vital addition to the Farnsworth canon."
1,Still Futurism,A new twist to an old lie. This book will keep you from seeing the truth. The book is full of some truth and a lot of error. I do not recommend it.
4,interesting,"If you are follower of Rood this may be old news, if not then this could be eye opening. It is short and to the point could probably read in a couple of hours."
4,Worked Great,I pump and siphon gas allot living on the water. I only used once so far but it is much heavier duty than the ones you can buy for $10. They did not hold up for me. I did not give it 5 stars only because I need to use it more.
1,FAKE!!,"My best friend actually got me ""DIVA"" These lipsticks are beyond fake what a scam!!! I'm sorry my friend didn't know better. 14 dollars for A FAKE lipstick that doesn't even look like the real thing"
3,A good book,"I liked most of this book. I have a male chocolate lab and wanted to know more about the breed. It covered every area from showing, to the breed standard to lab behaviors. The only subject I was dissapointed about was the lack of information on breeding a male labrador. I wanted to know more about the basic steps to take when breeding my male lab with a female. For example, when can I breed him? How do I get the word out that I have a male labrador to breed? If you're an owner of a female labrador, this book covered those areas. However, there were only a few lines on breeding a male."
2,Very lacking in information,"As a Registered Respiratory Therapist, I took PALS last year and was very impressed with a different PALS book used by the hospital. I was hoping that this PALS book by Barbara Achlert would contain similar information. But this book contains very little information and does not even cover the basics like toxicology (a major cause childhood ER visits) and cold-water-near-drownings. And the information that this book does provide is extremely sketchy with many important factors missing that are a vital part of the picture. I can only recommend this book to people who are not health care workers and who want to know little more than the basic CPR, and even in that situation, it would be a very weak recommendation. My final word is don't waste your money on this ""Study Guide""."
1,BEWARE: Two Different Editions!,"I ordered the wrong edition. if your are not familiar with this book, it has two editions. The ""Concise Editon"" lacks 150 pages found in the regular edition."
1,Extremely judgmental and tending towards mean,"I got this book for my daughter because it's supposed to be an empowering book for little girls where the ""princess"" doesn't depend on a prince to save herself. I was very disappointed to find that Cinder Edna's triumphs are all compared to Cinder Ella's failures. Cinderella is portrayed as self indulgent, vapid, stupid, and these things are played for comedy. I felt the tone was very judgmental and really quite mean towards Cinderella's desire to be pretty and her use of the fairy godmother. I like Cinder Edna's part of the story but it wasn't necessary to be cruel about Cinderella to be proud of Cinder Edna's spunk.Overall I was disappointed and will not be reading this to my daughter again."
5,SO MANY PATTERNS!! SO LITTLE TIME,"Great book. It's difficult to decide on a pattern. You decide on one and then see another that you just HAVE to make.... Sigh, I'll never get these all done!Good book, great patterns and wonderful instructions."
3,Decent pop filter,"Length:: 2:24 MinsThis is a decent filter, but the cut metal edges are rather sharp. I added a nylon to mine for added filtering, but even without the extra layer, it works fairly well. In the video I demonstrate the difference with and without the filter on a mic. The only problem is that, since I wasn't wearing headphones I didn't realize that I was too close to the mic and over-modulated, so the test is a little extreme.Also shown in this review are theOn Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone Standand the Rode R?DE NT3 - Microphone.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. So, please vote (The ""Was this review helpful to you: Yes or No"" buttons) and leave a comment if you'd like, even if it's just to say, Hi!"") When you leave a comment, I can go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy.Thanks, Claire"
1,bait and switch,"This is not what it looks like. when this showed up I was never so disapointed with any purchase as with this one. Its cheap crap wood, it smells real bad and it has a brass screw drilled into one side and has no rounded edges at all . it IS NOT as pictured in the ad. this did not make it to my kitchen it's in the garage as an odd's and end's jar. don't waste your money."
2,Dont put a sticker on the top of a wood item!,There was a sticker put on the top of this. Its wood and after getting the sticker and all the sticky residue that came with it off there is still a square on top of it from the sticker. It looks terrible....if this is what Amazon sells I wont be ordering again. It was supposed to be a xmas gift now I'm not sure what to do with it! Thanks!!
3,cool but flimsy,"These are pretty nifty, and I like the magnetic clasps for the earbuds which keep them from flopping about. However, they didn't hold up to my day-to-day routine, and one of the earbuds broke after a few months of use. I reassembled it, but it has a lingering buzz that makes it unusable."
4,Remington is the best--,My husband was very pleased to receive the Remington MS-900. He has used Remington products for many years and the MS-900 is another good example of the quality of Remington.
5,Cool,"In the book, the class pet, a bunny named Hopper sneaks out of her cage and chews on the noodles."
5,"Nephew said ""it rocks!""","I bought this for my 20 yr old nephew who is in a band. He said the book ""rocks"". It had a wide variety of oldie bands and current bands. Wilson needs to write Vol. 2."
5,great series on tv,This is a great tv series. The movie collection that goes with it is also good. When it was on tv I hated to wait until the next week for it to show again. Now it is on dvd and that is SOOOO nice. No commercials...and you can watch as much as you want without waiting til NEXT WEEK. Or NEXT SEASON!!
1,sorely disappointed,"I have to say I am VERY! dissappointed in my Babylon 5 collection series. Can anyone tell me how to return this item to Amazon to get my money back? I have only been able to stand trying to watch year one and part of year 2 and all I get is problems. From lack of sound to frozen action to a horrible buzzing that occurs after only a few minutes. Over and over again I try to clean the DVD disc or go on to the next scene and at times stop the whole DVD and reboot to try and go on with the show. But disc after disc shows me nothing but problems. It's not my DVD player, I have no problems playing ANY other DVD I have. I have yet to enjoy a single show from start to finish without a problem cropping up."
5,Absolutely the best,"This book is definetly intriguing from start to finish. Honestly, I couldn't stand the suspense! It inspired me to buy other books by this author. You should defintely give this one a try!"
4,"Very good as far as it goes, but would have loved something with more depth","This is a book of short personal essays on the American West by David Bayles.Many of them start in the form of a Socratic question, such as ""what is the West,"" ""where would you find the heart of the West,"" and so forth.In these particular essays, Bayles continues the Socratic theme by demolishing, overturning or in some way reframing the motive idea that lay behind the original question.In other essays, he slaughters sacred cows, or points out to the reader that many people in the West have not yet become that discerning about the West.Again, as noted, the essays are very good as far as they go. But they don't always wrestle with their issues deeply enough. It also seems that the essays, as nebulous as they are, could still be organized and grouped in some way, with ""meta-essays"" for each section."
1,Not worth a penny!,"I went out to my local guitar center in hopes of getting a good video to help me with some different techniques. I asked a guy that worked there and he suggested Chopbuilder to me. I thought 50 dollars was way too much but I gave it a try and bought it. When I popped it in the VCR, my boredom began. He sits on a chair playing through chromatic exercises and playing scales. If I wanted this I could go to a website and then go to guitar mania. This video is no good! It didn't teach me a thing. I am looking forward to returning it tommorow and getting John Petrucci's video instead. Take my advice, don't buy it!!!"
4,Spanish Verbs in Plain English,I was quite happy working with this book until I got to the future tense verbs page. Unfortunately this page does not show the same information as that on the cd rom so having learned the verbs I found I had to re learn the future verb tense.All the other information is very good and I am having fun learning in this manner
4,Bright beam,"The beam is visible enough to see in a dark room... and looks spectacular when you shine it outside on a rainy night. Battery life seems pretty reasonable, especially since AAA batteries are easy and cheap enough to find."
2,Fencing,I ordered this to keep my puppy out of my garden area but the quality is not real good. I live in Florida and it has warped from the hot sun because the plastic is not that strong and thick. The legs are too thick to pierce the grass and it is difficult to use.
5,great value,"Makes shooting my .300 Win. Mag. nearly a joy. Instead of wanting to stop after a half dozen shots, I shot a box. (downside is I'll spend more on ammo) Decent fit, stays in place, very good value."
2,Did not like this product,"Good idea, but it fits very awkward, it adds about an inch to the length, now it does dampen felt recoil, but after every shot the gel pad moves to the side off center from the back of the butt and has to be readjusted making follow up shots a pain"
3,Not great,Installed this on my remington shotgun but havent used it in the field yet.gel feels good but i dont think it will survive the season.Seems a little flimzy as well as cheap in construction.slides around alot on the end of the gun.I'll see on the 1st of Sept. for dove season.
5,gel recoil pads,These pads work great for women or younger kids who don't want to get bruising on thier shoulders from shooting a shotgun. It works great to lessen the impact of the butt of the gun.
4,Gel Recoil Pad :Shoulder Saver!,"After researching many different recoil pads, I went with this one for my Remington 788 (.308). Finding a rubber pad that could fit the butt was a tough search, so a slip-on became a must. I have three Remington 788 rifles, so I'll just rotate this pad as needed. (Two are .308s and one is a .223).The hard plastic butt caps on the 788 are brutal on the shoulder. This pad really took the pain out of shooting from a bench. Plus, I am 6'5"" and the extra length of pull makes my rifles actually fit me better now. A win-win situation.There can be a bit of play in the pad, but I'm not too anal about that. Mine came in black which I am happy about. The only reason I gave this pad 4 stars is that is has a little play and I have not used it enough to know how sturdy it will be. It may deserve 5 stars. Time will tell."
4,An Awesome review of History.,Ebby had many relapses--and that is our disease---but we must be very grateful he carried the message to Bill or where would we be today .
5,A must read,This book is a must read for anyone who wants to live healthy. Dr Batman explains role of water in great details and gives amazing details of his findings and debunks many widely recommended medical beliefs for e.g. salt and cholesterol. READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO live healthy. With in just few days of following this book lot of my problmes are gone and I am on my way to regain health.
3,"Great information, poorly written. A chore to get through.",Length:: 5:11 MinsA few minutes detailing why the book IS worth reading despite it's horrible writing and sludge of non-vitalinformation mixed in with the important stuff.
4,"You not Sick, you're just thirsty","The book was very informative and the research he did on dehydration and the effect on one's health was stunning, to say the least. One's entire bodily functions depend sooo much on water and salt to operate properly.This book will change the way we depend so much on prescription drugs. Everyone should read this wonderful book on body maintenance."
1,It doesn't really work as well as I thought it would,"Well there's a few things I don't like about this product.The dish where you put out the cigarette is made of plastic.It would have been better if it was some sort of metal.The fan isn't all that powerful,and doesn't suck up most of the smoke.The filters are similar to the covers that go on headphones.You have to keep one cigarette in the cigarette holder just to keep it going while you smoke.Not really loud but not whisper quiet."
2,lack of power,"the fan has no power, suction is totally lacking. batteries last less than two weeks; cost of them is about $8.00 monthly"
1,Christmas Book,"Emeril's Christmas cookbook is loaded with all sorts of interesting recipes. So many of them look really good. I love watching Emeril on FoodTV. He always cooks with such enthusiasm and flair. He also has a way of making the cooking look really easy. I have all of his books in my collection. I like to read his recipes, but I must admit that I am really disappointed with the inconsistencies in the recipes. In some cases, Emeril will call for a certain amount of one ingredient, but it will never be called for in the instructions, or he vice versa, he will call for something that wasn't listed in the ingredients. Sometimes the recipe appears to skip entire steps. I have really been disappointed with this, because as a professional Emeril should have been far more accurate and thorough."
1,Emeril's gagathon continues,"Oh my gosh, I can't believe what I just ate! Emeril Lagasse has put together another fine collection of stomach turning fare. What was he thinking? He has tried to put his special touch to old Christmas classics. I'm sorry, but not every dish should be taken to a Cajun extreme. Sadly, this book was given to me as a present. I'd donate it to a library, but it would be cruel of me to inflict this on a future generation of young cooks."
4,The Sin City Legacy,I admit having found this hard to come-by but was pleased to eventually recieve it because Sinners and Saints is a dark comic in unique style both artistic and story based. the stark black and white images with limited use of colour provides a nice alternative to the over-coloured world other titles may portray.The story is interesting and seedy and reminds me of frank millers Sin City books it is an overall good title and worth the investment though perhaps not if you live in the UK
5,Works Wonders,"A friend's mom had this about 15 years ago. I'd never heard of it but allergies, headaches, were too much. Just a few drops across the bridge of nose and sinuses open.Tense; rub tei fui on your temples, deep breathe and relax.The lotion in Tei Fu will fix ANY muscle cramp, ache or pain!"
1,Ineffective for macular protection.,"There are supplements which have been empirically proven to slow the onset of macular degeneration in adults, and to help protect against other vision problems, but Bilberry is not considered by reputable ophthalmologists to be among these. On the advice of doctors I have cancelled my Amazon Subscription for Bilberry Vcaps.Here on Amazon, look for AREDS formula supplements such as Bausch & Lomb's ""Preservision"". On line, you may wish to Google ""Tebs"" which are also proven to be efficacious. (I have no fiscal or any other relationship with any product - I provide this information because I have incipient macular degeneration and I have done a great deal of research to determine what works and what doesn't.)"
3,VERY Blue Tie,"It's VERY blue. HOT blue, so if you are looking for ""sky"" blue or a paler blue, this is not the tie for you. But if you are into BLUE as in electric blue, then you can't get more blue than this! It has quality construction."
1,One of Cheney's wife's cronies,"Does she have a degree in art history? Has she written any art criticism? No... clearly this woman is unqualified, and her efforts to marginalize the most experimental forms of artistic practice result not from any aesthetic criteria but from a clear knee-jerk reaction in goose-step line with the current Bush agenda. This is a heavily politicized book, one written not to explore in an intelligent fashion but merely to look good for the type of audience that watches Fox news."
5,"One of My WDW ""Bibles""","This is one of my favorite books on Walt Disney World. It's very thorough on it's descriptions of the parks, resorts (with maps) and WDW restaurants. The Perlmutter's put a personal slant on all their reviews that's valuable for my decisions on what to do at the parks."
3,"440 file limit is a problem, but---","I agree with most of the other comments. The 440 file/folder limit is unfortunate. However, if you are not committed to listening to every single song individually, there are many shareware tools on the web that will ""join"" or ""link"" MP3 files. (search with ""join mp3 files""). Make 2 - 4 min files into one 8 min file. This could halve the number of files you need. One hobby of mine is listening to movies in audio, by ripping the DVD audiotrack into MP3s. I don't need 30 separate 3 min segments."
4,An excellent second novel for Baxter,"This novel is a step up from Baxter's well done first novel, Raft. In this case, his writing is much more tight and clear.As for plot, this one is fascinating. I don't think that the topic of time-travel will ever lose its interest for me; in this case, Baxter was able to maintain my interest consistently throughout the book. Moreover, he adds other oft-used, but always interesting topics such as alien opressive rule and interplanetary communication. I have learned that there are more books about the Xeelee and now I want to find out more about these mysterious creatures who have such advanced technology. Baxter is indeed a master of ""hard"" sci-fi.On the negative side, I was disappointed with the ending that in some ways was predictable and awkward. Nonetheless, he kept the theme provocative and thoughtful"
1,Wrong Product Shown,"When I bought this gelled fuel the picture showed a capsule with gold colored sides and a pull off cover like we see them on yoghurts. The so pictured capsule fits many fondue burners. I got a container with a small hard cover which may fit some burner but is too high for the burner which is made for the pictured item. There is no way to confuse the two, they look different. In case the supplier still shows ths golden sides capsule be aware that this is not what you are getting."
5,America's Premier Glass Artist,"William Morris' Artifacts/Glass is inspiring, impressive, and visionary whether you are interested in glass or just interested in fine art. The photographs of Morris' work are beautiful, and the photographs of Morris' working on glass are just as beautiful! He's as nice a man as he is talented and creative, an inspired artist and thoughtful person. You won't regret having this glass art book in your collection of fine art books."
5,"Powerful, moving, intense!","""Spirit Walk"" is a powerful & moving statement of Pain & Truth.This album is intense to the point of becoming a part of one'spersonal being...""Spirit Walk"" may be played loud, soft, in the vehicle, at home,by one's self, or, with a group.The editor uses the word 'world' in his statement. What little'world' aspects are even noticeable, if anything, only ADDS to the overall effects of this great album..."
3,ADDRESSING framework,"easy to read, sometimes oversimplified for the experienced clinicianHays presents a new way of looking at the therapist-client relationship through the ""ADDRESSING"" framework, each letter emphasizing a different dimension of the therapist's and client's life"
5,Flawless,The rating has help me to choose the right product.The shipment is flawless. I received the product in perfect condition.
5,Brings back memories of Catholic High Mass,"It has been more than 40 years since I listened to Gregorian chant and I had forgotten how much I loved it. When I was a young child it was still the practice of the Catholic Church to chant the entire Mass for special holy days and other occasions. I never enjoyed attending Mass ""except"" these. The chanting was mesmerizing and the tonality so clean. I had the same reaction when I heard this album. The organ accompaniement to these songs is understated and complementary to the vocals. Very beautiful!"
5,Good for shallow drawers,"This does not look exactly like the picture, but close and it is very functional. My makeup drawer is very long but shallow, so it was difficult to find something to fit. This product is made of white, rigid, plastic, so the thickness does not take up valuable storage space. Happy with the purchase and would recommend."
3,Nice Gi with one exception,"Overall this is an okay karate uniform. The material is light yet feels robust and the stiching is good. However, beware of the drawstring pants as there are good size slits in the hips which can expose ones underwear. If one is skinny it may not be a problem, otherwise decorum necessitates safety pins or a sewing job."
5,A valuable legal guide for unmarried or same sex partners.,"Legalized marriage, or even common law marriage, gives a couple some automatic rights and privileges. This is not true of unmarried couples and same sex partners. If proper estate planning and power of attorney planning are missing from the relationship, then some distant, and sometimes unfriendly, relative might step in and ruin lives and property interests.The book by Hoyt and Pollock, both experienced attorneys, is must reading for those not ""legally married"" and can guide the couple into disaster prevention steps. It is a common sense guidebook that avoids unfamiliar legal terms. I like the down to earth approach of these two authors and recommend the book highly."
2,Pros and Cons,"There are things that I like about this calculator - the size of the calculator itself, the size of the buttons, and the size of the display. However, the buttons must be pushed VERY FIRMLY and SLOWLY (with every entry checked and double checked). Any attempt to speed up will result in missed digits and wrong results. I am already shopping for a calculator that is faster but still large enough for my elderly eyesight."
1,nice until it breaks,"While I enjoyed the easy storage and the rack it great the containers kept breaking. The lids are hard to get on correctly, and then hard to get off. We only have a few storage piecies left because they crack and break very easily. I have never had any other plastic storage product break, they are very poorly made."
1,Awful,"This product isn't worth this review, but will give one! The containers split easily, the holders falls apart if you look at it wrong. I had a few containers left and tossed them all. Don't try it"
1,horrible,"the idea was good, however the quality is horrible, the lids wont stay on the bottoms. The plastic is so cheap and the design is so poor that they warp and stay that way with very little effort. I had to throw out many of the lids or bottoms when they were new because they just didn't work. within two weeks the whole thing was in the trash. It was simple Junk. I am scared by the good reviews already posted about this product. Do not buy this you will regret it."
2,Not as advertised.,This is a very nice Anne Klein watch but it is not as advertised. It does not have a date indicator in the 3 o'clock position. It has nothing at all. If you don't need the date it is a good basic watch.
3,Ultimate John Wayne Collection,"This DVD collection contains two three-DVD sets, John Wayne - The Early Years and John Wayne 20 Movie Pack. The Early Years contains three 12-episode B&W features from the early 1930's. The 20 Movie Pack contains B&W movies from the 1930's, a 1963 color movie, and a 1971 feature length color documentary ""The American West of John Ford"". As one might expect, the B&W episode and movie audio is noisy and subpar by current standards, but the entire collection gives an idea of the development of the motion picture technology and the character of John Wayne. The collection is of historical value for this reason and is more than just entertainment."
3,A missed opportunity,"After visiting my daughter in Phoenix, I hoped to find a source that would help me identify, and also explain the culture of, the plants I found there. This book provides cursory information on plant form and culture. It is well designed, but lacking in crucial details.It is nearly worthless as a means of plant identification. The text of vegetative characteristics are vague or missing. It would be helpful to know if a plant is evergreen, deciduous, or summer deciduous. The pictures are so blurry and distant that only the form of the plant is visible. Some photos are of the plants in the wild and some in cultivation, differences that can dramatically change the form of a plant. And then, there are those irritating trinomial names without subspecies markers.The cultural data is abbreviated in bullet points with some good tips and general information. The early chapters give a brief, but informative, overview on desert gardening."
5,"I don't really like it but the customer service always email me, they may worth to be considered","I don't really like it but the customer service always email me, they may worth to be considered. So I bought it"
2,Useless!,I am in pro audio and know software very well. This thing doesn't work. It is totally non-intuitive and was a waste of money!
4,Half Moon Street,"Please take out the duplicate review which says 0 out of 1 found this helpful, when there was no place to make such a comment. It looks bad on the promotion page and doesn't help your sales!"
4,"Harsh, revealing take on the Holocaust","This book is quite well-written, with believable characters and a strong, rich plot that flows well. Hansel and Gretel, unwillingly abandoned by their father and stepmother into the Polish forest, find themselves taken in by Magda, the village ""witch"". They must protect their Jewishness at all costs, but they also must just survive against the horrors of the Nazi SS. This book is not for the faint of heart by any means; Murphy spares no punches with the violence and the realities of Poland at the time. A few of the characters, such as the Oberfuhrer, seem over the top, and motivations aren't always well-defined. While not the first writer to weave a Holocaust story around a fairy tale, Murphy does it well and leaves an impression I'm sure I won't soon forget. But for the minor flaws already mentioned, this one would rate a solid 5 stars. Recommended reading, but don't expect a light tale. Be prepared to have your emotions rubbed raw."
4,READ IT,"Im not a writer but this Louise Murphy is......I cant convey how good this one was, its truly worht reading tonight!great retelling of hansel and gretel ,with the Nazi's as the wolf.its much more than it appears to be. a great read."
5,Precious Solitude,"A book with an inviting title that delivers what it promises. Precious Solitude is a perfect retreat companion, but provides an extensive menu of ideas for how to relax, refuel, and rejuvenate even with our everyday lives swirling madly around us. Adopt just a handful of suggestions from Ruth Fishel's latest and relearn the meaning of the word ""calm."" You'll be glad you did -- and honestly, so will those around you. Incidentally, if you're tempted to dismiss the notion of solitude as an unimaginable luxury, then you need this book even more than most of us!"
1,Scam,"On April 18 we placed an order for the above oven. The site stated there was 5 in stock. Our shipment day was to be on the 21st. We received an email stated that the warehouse was out of stock. ( I thought they had 5 on Hand) We were to receive this order on the 25th. When I called their customer service line the recorded message was ""we are closed for the holidays"" call back later. I called again today the 26. The same recorded message. I feel this is not a reliable vendor and would NEVER use them again."
2,Horrible Proofreading/Lack of Knowledge,"I bought this book because it appeared to be good for vegans and vegetarians who also want to reduce their gluten/wheat consumption. I thought with the word ""vegan"" on the front of the book, that at least the author would know what that was. There's a definition section that involves the author making uninformed statements about a (lacto-ovo) vegetarian diet not causing death to animals. There are supposed vegetarian items with marshmallows and Worcestershire sauce. Page 36 involves a recipe, Surprise Muffins, that states that vegans and vegetarians need to omit the gelatin; yet on the SAME page, Applesauce Bread tells egg-free people and vegans to ADD gelatin to the recipe. I am very disappointed in this book and the way it is written. I can understand that people make mistakes, but these are repeated throughout the book."
4,Handy tool,"I bought several of these levels for a golf course rating team. One of the levels didn't get used right away, so when I removed it from its packaging about a year after purchase, the liquid in the level had disappeared, making the level useless. But I used one of the ""working"" levels and it worked very well."
3,good for the price,"Item works ok however in dim light I have trouble seeing the bubble in the level, in bright sunlite it works fine for the price it works ok"
1,Waste of money,"My roomate and I both are upset at this scale being a total waste of money! You can get on and off the scale and with in moments it can show a difference of up to 10 lbs! I wanted a scale that was consistent for home use, and apparently, that is not possible with out buying a professional scale like the one at the doctors office.CK"
5,LOVE IT!!!,I recommend this read. I need it for my English college course for advance creative writing and it was just calming to know that I was able to read it instantly through Kindle Fire an just on time for my research paper.
3,Disturbing and yet,I found myself continuing to read. Bone was a wonderful character full of depth and I wish that I could have been there to protect her. Her mother made me mad making her think it is her. It is awful to think that this happens to many children every day. This is a very graphic novel and as it has been said many times in other reviews not for everyone. I hope wherever Bone is things have gotten better but I am not too sure about that.
2,In need of a good editor,"I found the book poorly written. Here are my criticisms. The book would have been much tighter if about 100 pages had been trimmed. I found whole sections pointless. The supporting cast of characters all blend into two prototypes: the drunken, violent male and the hardworking female. The plot device of the birth certificate stamped ""illegitimate"" seems tacked on to the beginning and end in an attempt to give the rambling narrative some point. The ending of this book annoyed me. It was a cheat. Disturbing for the sake of being disturbing. The mother character gave no hint of being capable of such behavior. This was made into a Showtime movie. Don't watch it, and don't bother with the book either."
1,Rushed thru it so I could start reading a GOOD book!,"If I wanted to know about a life like Bone's, I could've watched COPS. The disfunction on every page was so predictable and classic white-trash.zzzz... It will, I'm sure, be on TV in no time -->something I would watch if nothing else was on. Don't waste your time and money!"
1,Aweful Aweful Aweful,"Aweful. That's the word that best describes the movie. While I love the actor, he can't save the day even if were the real SuperMan. I think what destroys the movie more than the bad script (which us dragon lovers are used to), is the repeated dragon clip they use for most of the dragon shots. 1 shot moving down a hallway.. same shot, reversed. Oh wait lets do it again, and again and again. That's the entire visual effect of the Dragon. 1 clip being reversed like a pancake. Same shot mind you, going left then going right. That's it. That's the big Dragon effect. OMG, just shoot me! I even love B movies but this one was just aweful. I mean, even a bad script can survive if the cgi was halfway decent to make it a B movie but this one is definately F for Flush it!"
4,I am considering a cow...,"AS a city raised girl I never thought too much of raising livestock. Then I retired with my wonderful county raised husband. We got 10 acres which we started gardening then economy went nuts so we have been thinking of getting some animals to raise for food and dairy products. I am so tired of hearing all the bad things going on with our foods. Solution seems to be do it yourself. This book answered a lot of questions about cows and what type of work is involved, food for the cow and it shelter needs. It is well written and full of knowledge on this subject. I am still tying to see if a cow or goats would be best and I lean to the cow as it is less likely to jump over fences and stand on my car. (things I have heard from goat owners.) If you need some good input about raising a cow this is a good book to start with."
2,Stick to your day jobs...Not what expected,"I was really excited when I ordered this book from Amazon.com. I try to read a Halloween themed book every October to put me in the Halloween spirit; this book fell short of my expectations though. There are a handful of good stories, about 5 of them, that made me feel my money wasn't totally wasted. But the rest are sub par stories written by non-professional writers. There was really something lacking. It was a stretch at best for some of these stories to even be in the book, because they didn't deal with Halloween, only loosely hinting at it. The idea behind the book was pretty cool; a compilation of stories originally read aloud on Halloween Night at a series of Halloween parties over a ten-year period. All I can say is that if these were the best stories from the parties, I am glad I wasn't invited! ."
2,A Few Gems But Mostly Predictable,The one line summary says it all. A few of the stories were outstanding but I could see where most them were going in the first few pages. This book isn't very good as far as horror anthologies go.
2,Early Works in the Horror Genre,"Lovecraft's short stories presented here seem a bit tame given the explosion of horror over the last 30 years, however some interesting ideas are pursued. A good workout for the vocabulary, it definitely helped to fill time on a long vacation drive."
3,Buyer beware . . .,"The title and cover art is deceptive- it is not another work in Bardic Voices, but a collection of all kinds of Mercedes Lackey's short stories (previously published). If you like all of her series, then you will probably enjoy this book. You may want to check it out of the library before deciding to add it to your personal collection."
1,Gift,"Again, this book was sent directly to a sibling as a gift for someone. So I can't really rate it. Again it would be nice if the rating selections were a bit more flexible."
1,Terribe,"I couldn't believe how bad this book was. As a fan of the hardcore/punk scene in my teenage years I found almost the whole book to be unreal. I was actually rooting for something bad to happen to Frank because 1)he started to annoy the hell out of me, and 2)I just wanted something interesting to happen. The dialogue was totally forced and unrealistic and scenes tended to go on forever. In spite of myself, I actually managed to finish it. If your a serious reader, don't get this book. It is aimed at the young teenage crowd that doesn't pick up a book to often."
5,Punk Anthem,"I loved it. The characters were alive with dialog and actions so familiar and cherished, you'll see old friends here in different names and faces. I felt at home. This book mirrored life in all facets. My favorite parts were the descriptive panoramas of shows on the road and at the Outhouse. Romalotti has a talent to put you in the middle of madness being birthed on a sagging stage occupied by people just like us. Reminded me of every perfect and worst moment in my life. Impressive and needed, Salad Days is an anthem of growing up punk. I can't wait to read his next book."
3,pretty average,"first off, the range of trimming lengths are 1/8-45/64th of an inch.i guess i should have read the tech specs since i typically like to trim as close as 0.06 inches. so that was quite unsatisfactorysecondly, the built in plug is a bit of annoyance since our plug point is mounted at a location where the plug cant slide in fully due to built in obstructions above and below the plug point.thirdly, i have had the motor stall a bunch of times within a month of usage. i dont know why - i am guessing it has to do with it running low on charge quite rapidly. if so, the 45 min operating time per charge is an overestimate by a factor of ~4."
1,Worked great for 30 mins.,I bought one and used it twice in six weeks to trim my beard. Two weeks later I tried to use it and it was dead and would not charge. Seller said it had a 30 day warrantee and they were sorry. This is the only trimmer I have ever had that just died for no known reason. Others have lasted for years.The sellers has my money and says he is sorry. This may be a good price and works well but a product is only as good as the people who stand behind it. They think so little of their product to fear standing behind it I would not buy from them at any price. Amazon is a good company and has always tried to help with problems but this seller and this trimmer does not live up to their high standard. As they said they are sorry.John Evers
2,Panasonic Beard and Moustache Trimmer (ER389K),"I found the Panasonic trimmer to be very quite, sharp and comfortable to handle."
1,Still waiting - a note on shipping - not a product review,"Can't really review this thing, because I'm still waiting for it from Amazon. I ordered it on February 21, and just got a note from them saying it will be delayed, with an estimated delivery by May 20..That would be 3 months!So...don't believe the shipping estimate. It doesn't ship within 1-2 weeks. Maybe more like 1-2 months. Yes, I'm looking forward to using this. But by May 20, I'll look like I'm in ZZ Top.Buy this thing somewhere else."
1,panasonic Trimmer,Please send me my Trimmer first and then i will write review.Its been so many day pass and i have not recive my stuff you should send me my stuff free of charge beause you fail to complet my orderr on time.Thank you
1,please send me my Trimmer,"I dont know how to rate this item,when i did not recive that.I place that order on Aug 05 2002 and it should have diliver in between Aug 16 2002 to Aug 29 2002 but it has not arrivei dont understant what kind of service you when you dont do your job on time.........................now when you fail to complet my order on time you should send me my trimmer for free of charge or send me some gift for your terrible service."
4,Great Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer,I have been using this brand and make for four(4)years and it's been serving me well. It has a nice size and I like how it is rechargeable. I Had to purchase it again because it fell twenty feet and broke. This and only this I use no other.
1,Not like the old Panasonic ER200B,"My old Panasonic trimmer was showing it's age, so I thought I'd try a new one--a tremendous disappointment! This ER389K was completely unacceptable,and I returned it. The cutters are too fine, and the thicker beard hairs (most of them are,of course much thicker than the hair on your head!) pass over the cutting teeth unscathed. The height adjustment is difficult to set, and there isn't a positive enough lock. Finally, it is a rechargeable only cutter, without a cord option like my old one.I decided that my 20 year old Panasonic ER200B still works well enough, and I congratulate Panasonic for that design. Why not remake it?"
1,Doesn't trim close enough to suit me.,I like the compact design without a separate charger. I miss having a pop up trimmer.
3,A good Effort,"I've never read anything else by Dalkey, but knowing something of the period she adapted to Fantasy, I would have to say this is a good effort, but not an excellent one.It is a must read for those who eat, sleep and breath everything Japanese. But this is definately not a novel that grabs hold and keeps you rivitted, though for the first forty or so pages it may seem that way.Much of this tradgedy should have been heartbreaking, but I found myself less and less sympathetic to the characters almost wishing I didn't know them so well."
2,Not easy to use.,"This book is an excellent guide for disassembly. It is worthless as a guide for reassembly. There are no step-by-step instructions for reassembling a firearm. At best, the book assumes that reassembly is the reversal of the steps involved in disassembly. This is not necessarily so. I would not recommend this book to a hobbyist."
5,Underground culture in mid-70's SoCal,"Author Seth Morgan's only book Homeboy was begun while Morgan was in prison for Theft in the late 1970's. Homeboy is a crime novel set in mid-seventies San Francisco - a bittersweetly hilarious and haunting portrait of where underground culture, a bleak underworld of sex and drugs, meets mainstream culture. Homeboys like central characters Joe Speaker and Lt. Tarzana, are the people on both sides of the law that make up this brutal exchange."
1,"Good for HP DeskJets, worthless for Epson Styluses","I bought this premium transparency film and had no problems using it in my old HP DeskJet. But then my HP DeskJet printer died and I bought an Epson Stylus C82.These transparencies work like crap in the Epson, maybe by design? Instead of getting solid black areas, I get severe banding (tiny horizontal lines that ink doesn't stick to), making this stuff useless for the printed circuit board exposures I wanted to use it for. IBM transparencies work perfectly in the Epson printer, so I don't blame the printer, it's these HP transparencies.Only buy these if you know you will only be using them on an HP printer!"
5,Can't beat Scotch pads,"I use all grades of Scotch pads frequently and usually buy them by the contractor box in local big box stores. For whatever business reason, none of the stores near me carry ANY of them in any amount. Thank goodness for Amazon. I got a huge supply of every grade I wanted at an excellent price. Thank you Amazon."
4,Great little am walk!,"The Morning Mile Plus Abs partners with The Evening Mile Plus Legs as the SUN AND MOON set. Each walk is one mile in length. However this set NEVER was released on DVD according to the folks at lesliesansone.com. Neither walk is on DVD. They are available only on VHS.The walk is a nice one. Leslie leads 6 other exercisers in one brisk mile of walking. Simple steps, marches, side steps, gentle kicks. Typical Leslie fare. At the end of the tape she leads you through 10 minutes of ab exercises.The tape is great if you are short on time or just need a quick mile!"
2,pachmayer decelerator pad,"the rifle stock needs modifications and re-finishing for this product to be acceptable, it is in no way a pre-fit item as was indicated in the description."
1,Did not get Brass washers,"The bolts look ok, but since the washers I got are not brass as the description said, I am not 100% sure the bolts are solid brass. I also received 3 extra bolts and about 10 extra non-brass washers that I did not order. Very strange."
1,Waste of $$,"Do not waste your money.Honestly, I wonder why I bought it myself.If you have computer access, you can already get this information & it's not worth having in a book."
5,Wonderful,"After listening to this cd over and over and yes....over again, I fell so much in love with it. Their voices blend together like a good chocolate cake mix. Can't wait for the CD release."
3,Ok Book.,"This book was ok. It gave a look at a different kind of living experience. Two people fall in love among the discovery of a mass grave and a corrupt government. Irene and Francisco journey through their shared experiences and keep their love intact. Francisco is there for Irene when she needs him as she grows. When she finally realizes her love for him, they stay together and Francisco tries to protect her. When she is shot, Francisco is there the whole time to help her recuperate. He brings her with him as they try to escape the country. I didn't really like this book. It was confusing with its flash backs and memories but after a couple of times I could kind of understand it."
1,"Worst science ""book"" ever","Does this man know what science is? Also, the title doesn't make a lick of sense. But then again this is from the man who believes that there's something scientific and also godly about the shape of a banana."
1,What a load of crap,"This book is loaded with specious reasoning, half truths and deceit. He takes sections of the bible either out of context or he ignores the knowledge of what the writers of the bible may have had and presumes a supernatural influence without showing any valid reason for his conclusions. Typical biblical literalist dogma. For example, he quotes the bible saying that the world is a circle and then goes on to proclaim this knowledge was not ""known"" until much later. But, in fact, a circle is *not* sphere (which is the earth actually is)."
3,It's What Kids Love!,"Kids at the library during read-aloud time love this book. Yes, it's Hersheys, but I think too much is made of the parents issues with commercialism. Kids have interest, of course, in what interests them, and chocolate interests them. As there are no counting books about brussel sprouts, I guess we can't experiment with the dreadful little things, too. The bottom line is that they are fun and hold interest better than other math-skills books."
2,Edible math,There are plenty of math manipulatives besides a brand-name chocolate for children to use to have fun solving math problems. How about carrot or celery sticks that they can dip in nutritious yougurt? M & Ms have their own math book too. Why hook children on this commercialism when there are so many healthy alternatives?
1,Buy the Nyko Intercooler TS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I read the positive reviews and I ordered this thinking it would help my console. WRONG! It didn't cool my system, it actually gave the RROD. I sent my xbox into microsoft thinking the cooler didn't cause it. It did right when i recieved it back it gave the RROD again after 20 minutes of playing! So please just go and buy a nyko intercooler TS hereXbox 360 Intercooler TS"
1,Lasted one day,"I picked this thing up before GTA IV came out cause my elite was overheating. Thing lasted less than 3 hours, cause the next day I go to use it and it doesnt turn on. Awesome I know, i dont even get a dumb light stand, in other relations the intercooler EX worked awesome.FAIL!"
3,It's a fan,"As the other reviews state, it works and doesn't use the console for power. I actually own two of these(one for each 360), one of them needs to be smacked once in a while because the fan is rubbing on something and making a loud grinding-kinda sound. Next time i would try another brand with the same features...Oh btw - Amazon, why does the rating system ""think"" this is a game? It's not *fun*, it's a fan... It blows air."
3,"Not so ""cool""","I read the reviews about the cooling station, so I was expecting this. But I was surprised when i turned it on!!! I can even feel the air when I put my hand over it!!! I was expecting this, so I was prepared for modding it.So, 10 minutes after opening the cooling base, I decided to mod it. I am running it at 12V (the fan are 12V, so you should have no problems) and I removed the air filters in the bottom.Now is trowing more air, but not enough for my taste. My intercooler TS is doing all the work now. I will go to a local store and take some good fans and replace the crappy ones that come with the base.BTW, the glow stand looks very cool!!"
2,Broke after two weeks,"I bought this stand because I had planned on playing the Dead Rising ""infinity mode"" where you cant save or turn your xbox off and play for atleast 17hours straight and thought it might help keep the console cool. I cant really say if it cooled the console or not since I hadnt had heat problems before and didnt when useing it either. When it worked it was fine, there is a slight bit of noise but less than the console makes so it wasnt a problem. However after about two weeks of pretty lite use, the fan seems to of come lose and wobbles around like mad inside, the noise is horrible so it has become unusable."
3,Decent,"When I first got the fan it worked wonderfully, it was not louder than the 360 and the green glow added a cool effect. Unfortunately after a while I believe one of the fans became unbalanced and now it's very noisy for a little while after I first turn it on. Another thing I noticed is that the air coming out of the fan is very cool compared to the air coming out of the back of the Xbox. The fan doesn't really form a decent vacuum with the system because it is concave upward while the bottom of the Xbox is flat allowing a large portion of air to be drawn in from the outside.EDIT: I realized that the air is actually blown into the 360 and not sucked out. The same problems still apply however and the fact that it blows air into it makes it even worse."
4,"Looks cool, but noisy","I have to agree with Manrow. It worker great for 2 days then began making a horrible loud noise on start-up. I think the frame was made a little too weak to support the weight of the 360. It does stop after about 20 to 30 seconds and becomes the proper whirring fan noise. The small switch on the back is annoying, also. However, it looks good and the color and chrome trim compliment the 360 very well, and according to Microsoft (yes, I actually called), they said that this fan or one similar THAT HAS ITS OWN POWER SUPPLY would ""work great to cool the 360"" in turn prolonging the life of the unit. The 360 can be heard as a low hum across the room. With the 360 and this fan on, it is definately louder but not too bad. Sounds the same as those cheap computer fans. Any add-on fan for this kind of price that actually works is going to raise the overall noise level of a 360. Overall, a small price to pay now to keep from paying a big Microsoft repair price later."
3,Use with Intercoller TS,The Xbox 360 Cooling Station does not do the job by itself. You must also buy the Intercooler TS; this combo will keep your Xbox running cool.Keep on playing!!!Frank Williams
4,"Good, but could be not so loud",I had an over heating issue with my 360 which lead to making this purchase.My over heating issues so far are behind me. The fans are loud (louder than the 360) is my only complaint. The lights are nothing special. But the item does as it says. No complaints. As long as I am not over heating I can handle the extra noise. A give and take.JJ
5,Sheer brilliance!,"If this is modern opera, opera has unquestionable longevity!!! I have been moved, thrilled and exhilarated by this production - and cannot stop watching it. The artistic concept of this production and interpretation of Strauss's opera will even get the composer's approval. Gone are the cardboard islands and caves and we find ourselves in a beautiful modern day restaurant. Emily Magee is a Garbo of divas - in looks, style and voice. Her acting abilities and indulgence in the role is Fleming-like, but without the self indulgence. Roberto Sacca has Brando presence and a voice that will melt you. The last 25 min between the hero and the victim was breathtaking - even more so in Blu-ray and HD sound. Long story short - Strauss and Ariadne lovers - you HAVE to see this! Long live opera tailored for modern times and audiences and I hope we see lots more form American soprano Emily Magee."
3,Good Album Overall,"It takes a little time to grow on you, but it's a good album overall. Definitely worth the purchase."
3,Worthy and weighty...,"Yes, this album is worthy and weighty and serious and yada yada. I just dont like it as much as their other stuff though, dont know why, just.. well, theres nothing wrong with it, but it doesnt make me want to check in at the Hotel Existence any time soon. Sorry lads."
5,Mea Culpa - FABULOUS!,This is a wonderful story that keeps you guessing till the end. The author's attention to detail is impresive. The descriptions of character's thoughts and feelings as well as their surroundings pull you into the story to the point where you can smell the crisp air and feel exactly what the characters are feeling.I don't read many mysterys but this was a book that wouldn't let me put it down that's how good it was!
5,OMG!,"Since the moment I put in the First Season of SATC in my DVD player, my boyfriend and I basically made it ""our"" show. Though my boyfriend really never got in to nor had the time to watch any SATC, he was hooked after the first episode. Little over a month after receiving the boxed set of Seasons 1-5 and Season 6, Part 1.... we are on Season 6, Disc 2. We are anxiously anticipating the release of Season Six Part 2!!!"
1,Worthless.,"This unit is supposed to remove oil and possibly blackheads and quite frankly removes nothing. I never even saw marks on my face at all, no matter how high the suction or how long I leave it in one place. I tried it on my preteen son who has multiple, very superficial blackheads and nothing at all was produced. Save your money."
1,Waste of Money,"I don't usually leave reviews unless the product was great or unless it was completely useless. For me, this product did nothing. Biore strips are better than this product. Though it did leave a hickey on my boyfriends nose for about 3 days. So, at least I got a laugh out of this product. But, that was all I got."
1,"May be good for a somebody else, but my wife.",On my wife that device doesn't seem to be working at all
4,This thing is fun...,"Despite some varied reviews, I took a chance. So happy I did. If you can (this part is graphic) regularly sqeeze gunk out of the pores on your nose, this cleanser is awesome, and a real time saver. You get immediate results and pores get smaller as you use it over time, every two days or so. It only works after or in a hot shower or bath, when your pores are open. I use it in conjunction with Joey's Pore Cleansing Gel, but never on the same day, of course. So, if you have healthy (relatively Acne free)skin, but are battling giant pores and blackheads - give this a shot."
4,Pretty good,"I was looking for an extremely small shaver and although i can't say that this one is as small as i thought it was, it works pretty well. IT also looks very nice."
3,"cheaply painted, but fairly good shave for travel","Panasonic started this years ago, to increase sales of electronics...they paint the models instead of being immpregnated plastic.So as the models work, just using the shaver or phone or any 'silver' piece the color wears off. This is called planned obsolescence and it makes this model or anything they make like this a waste of time.ANY kind of face cream will only make it wear off faster and quickly becomes trashed."
4,This product is adequate,"An inexpensive trimmer that does the job just fine. Not great, not bad, just about what you'd expect. A good deal for the product."
4,Works great,This product works great and the batteries last for ages. The description when I ordered said it was supposed to come with a storage bad and I didn't receive one.
4,Good trimmer!,"This trimmer is comfortable to hold, which is important for those of us with carpal tunnel syndrome, and comfortable to use. It does a very good, even job and has 5 different settings so that you can have the hair length you prefer. Those who prefer longer lengths can have it while still getting the benefits of an even trim.As another reviewer noted, the trimmer does not come with the bag shown in the picture, which means that you get to figure out a way to keep the trimmer and the brush together. For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.Really, though, those issues are very minor, and I'm quite happy with the trimmer. I'd definitely recommend it!"
5,Tidy for baby delivery and more,"During the delivery of my little girl by C-section, the doctor/nurses kept talking about how ""neat"" my pubic area was. They complimented the prep-nurse, who finally told them that she didn't do the prep, that I came in that way. Needless to say, I love this product and have been using it for years, both before and after the birth."
2,Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,The product doesn't work very well. It doesn't trim very well and it kind of hurts or tugs at the hairs. I will probably throw it out and get a different type of trimmer. Not worth the money at all.
3,Not the same as the 3650,"The v4600 is apparently supposed to be the new version of the Samsung DVD-V3650. I bought the 4600 thinking it was the 3650 one of which I already own. Beware that the 4600 remote control does not control TVs like the 3650 remote does. Since I am trying to reduce the number of remotes I have to use and I really liked the 3650, I am taking the 4600 back to the store. The picture seemed ok but the functionality is not as good as the 3650."
1,Samsung never again,"I purchased this unit at a great price in order for my wife to do old VCR exercise tapes and for me to watch DVD or VCR movies. I set it up; put in a tape; it ate the tape. I thought it was a fluke. No, it ate another tape.I agree that the DVD stuff looks great. But I would not risk another tape on this unit."
1,save your money,"1 week to the day, the warranty ran out. The dvd player displayed a connot read error. I called Samsung and they suggested getting a dvd cleaner disc. I did. And guess what? the player could not read the disc!I will not buy another product made by Samsung."
4,Awesome!,"Yea, Tatum is magnificent! Reading the transcriptions while listening to the recordings just makes his playing even more amazing and enjoyable. This book is great and can keep you very busy. By the way, if you want to play like Art there is a another book, ""The Right Hand According to Tatum"" which has even more transcriptions, tells you how to finger and use his runs,has some analysis etc. This book could have used a bit of that. Good Luck!"
1,CD Length,"This is music that touches the heart, but for those with healing practices that are accustomed to CD's of 50-60 minutes in length, you may want to know that this 'One' is a single song with 17 passages. Therefore the total amount of music is about 31 minutes. If you are like me and have an hour-based client practice, you may want to play it in 'repeat' mode."
2,Badly written hero worship,"Getting High: The Adventures of Oasis is trite, incongruous and overly long hero worship. The book jumps from one minor story to the next - in some places it jumps forward and back in time - but somehow does not read as a whole work. Imagine a (badly written) 400 page magazine article about a rock band and you will grasp the overall feel of this book. Hewitt seemingly glorifies Oasis's worst behavior (Noel's and Liam's fights, tantrums, moodiness and hardcore drug use). The book talks glowingly of Noel Gallagher, as a songwriter and musician, lumping him in with the greats; Lennon/McCartney, Jagger/Richards, Paul Weller, Pete Townshend and Burt Bacharach. While he is, indeed, a talented individual, Noel would be the first to admit that he is not in the same league as those music giants. There are some great stories in this book and diehard Oasis fans will get some enjoyment out of it. But, unless you love all things Oasis, don't waste your time on this book."
1,Junk,"I'd give it zero stars if I could.This is completely worthless. There are problems besides the key issue.All you have to do is pull hard and the lock comes apart and you are holding the two pieces in your hands wondering why you ever spent your money on garbage. I'd like my money back, if only I could.Don't waste your cash on it! You've been warned."
2,"Did not work on my 2 5/16"" hitch","I could not get this to attach on my trailer that uses a 2 5/16"" ball hitch. The shackle/base wasn't wide enough. I'm not sure if this is just an issue with a specific type of hitch, but I doubt it. On my 2"" trailers it works fine. If you got the big ball it probably won't work. From what I can see it looks pretty easy to defeat, doesn't seem to heavy duty to me."
1,Not Well Made,"Unhappy With Product,Locks Only On One Side.It Was Sent To Me Unpackaged And Key Was Broken Off Inside Lock...."
2,Key is crap,I bought this at wally mart and returned it because the key I got was completely straight save for one notch. Must take 10 seconds to pick.
5,Excellent Product,"I just wish they made a version of this for my other trailer which has a 2 5/16"" coupler on it. This one is for a 2"" coupler."
1,Displeased with company/person who sold the book to me,"The content of the book is great but the person or company who shipped the book to me is not so great. Before purchasing the book I checked out the description because I did not want a heavily marked/highlighted book but that's what I got. I think the description was faulty and I'm displeased. At the moment I do not have the info related to the person/company who offered the book for sell but as soon as I do I'll report back. I asked the person/company to send me a less ""used"" marked copy and never heard back."
1,Installation Problems,"This software looks great on paper and I've read plenty of positive reviews, but I'm having major installation problems that IBM's technical support team seems incapable is solving. Halfway through the voice analyzation procedure, the software simply stops recording, thus rendering itself useless. I'm very disappointed with ViaVoice and will return it for a refund."
4,Beautiful Voice and Great Words!,"Jayme has a gift for songwriting, and she has made incredible improvements with the guitar. This blend makes her an excellent songwriter and performer. You can tell she is relaxed and reveals a little of herself in each song. Oh!. Did I forget to mention her voice?. Well buy the CD and see for yourself. It is true she sounds a little like Joan Baez, but her style is different. I didn't give her a 5 because I expect her next album to be even better, and there are no 6s."
2,not the bargain you might think,"I needed to purchase a printer capable of accomodating 11x17 media for my architecture coursework and was initially attracted to the canon bjc5100 due to its price. I owned a canon printer previously and was well satisfied with it but this printer has done nothing but let me down. I found the manual feed-from-behind feature a tremendous annoyance as it requires a great deal of space. Also the printer does not automatically align any media fed from the rear so at least a third of my papers go through crooked despite profuse efforts to get them in straight. I also had a new problem occur recently. The printer decided to no longer recognize 11x17 media size and now every time I want to print at that size, I have to custom set it. Very annoying. Sure it's now going for around 99 bucks in all the stores, but keep in mind you're getting what you pay for."
5,Great supplement for learning Spanish!,"From the perspective of a Spanish teacher, this is a wonderful book to help build your Spanish vocabulary and comprehension.The way the it's set up is: On one page there is a FULL page cartoon strip in color. There is a lot of dialogue, idioms, and basic vocabulary. One the opposite page is a list of vocabulary found in the comic strip in Spanish and English, divided into categories. The book is organized by cartoon title and topic. Some topics include: food & drink, money, travelling, etc. There are 30 cartoons in total, a well-organized table of contents, a glossary and a verb conjugation help section.I definitely think this would be a great way to expand your knowledge (or your students' knowledge) of Spanish in a very interesting and humorous context.The content is appropriate for high school and college level students, and for any level of study, although first and second year students would need help understanding the more complex structures."
4,The Complicated Artist,"I really enjoyed being placed in turn of the century France. What except romance and frivolous personalities could come of blending this period with French Artists. Guilbert has the strong-will of a master who wants not to please the museums but himself. A selfish man with his possessions but also generous enough to give his last penny away. He teams up with Verchard, a troubled soul who doubts his own skill as a painter, but remains a steadfast confidant of Guilbert. There is love, betrayal, promiscuity and ignorant loyalty played out in this work. One will be longing to view the actual paintings and photographs of Guilbert, to stroll into the caf√© and drink with he and his cronies. Hill is highly expressive, bringing together the sights, smells, and sounds of Paris. Mais oui, I will look for his future works."
2,EXTREMELY FANS ONLY,"VIDEO AND SOUND VERY POOR.UNLESS YOU ARE A FANATIC BUY THIS....OTHERWISE BE CONTENT WITH OTHERS DVDS LIKE ""WHEN IN ROME 2007"" OR ""THE VIDEO SHOW"""
1,can't live like this,I think his diet is basic starvation. Two protien shakes a day and a big salad for lunch? you got to be kidding me! how can you live like this? I know I can't and I am disappointed that he thinks this is the only way you can lose weight.
2,Do not waste your money,"First off, Gene has like chapters dedicated to his philosophy on jiu-jitsu, it's origin, history, etc... and he goes into way too much information on himself, as if we care. Bottom line is, yes, this is a really big book. Unfortunatlly, there is nothing special about the techniques, his descriptions and the pictures are very faint and make it difficult to see what is going on. Really, if this was like 1/4 the price that he is charging, then maybe it would be worth it. Dont buy this, rather spend your money on Renzo's book and Carlson's new book. Ten times better and you can still buy both of them for less than this one costs."
2,"Great videos, cheap material","These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
5,A game my 3 year old can actually play!,It's true! My 3 year old can actually play this game with us. It took a few rounds but now he's a pro and it's an enjoyable experience to sit down with him on game night. The game is very quick and very easy. Essentially it's a matching game with a little bit of strategy thrown in to spice things up.
5,Must have.,"The whole family enjoys this game, but especially my 5 1/2 year old, he LOVES it.Our family has IPad, IPod and DS, but ""Family Game Night"" is a worthwhile and wonderful practice that can not be replaced. This game was on our coffee table for a solid 2 weeks, and my sons brought it to play with their Grandparents also. We will be ordering other versions."
4,Moisturizing!,I have begun to use this product in conjunction with my facial moisturizer and by itself. Keeps my skin supple.
3,Nice present,"Nice little tool and golf balls. Probably could do without the golf balls, but its a nice gift. The tool is handy for an avid golfer, but most people could probably do without. That being said, its built of good quality."
3,"hefty, clunky, but maybe worth it to carry","This is a well built product-- maybe even a bit over-built. I've owned mine for a couple months now and probably played 20 rounds of golf with it... I find that the ball mark repair tool is maybe a bit wider than needed, plus it picks up dirt -- important, because the tool's teeth retract into the body, taking some dirt with it. I have used cheap BMR tools that work better that probably cost a nickel to make. Also the ball marker has gotten loose in my pocket every once in a while (I consider myself lucky not to have lost it yet -- a spare would be appreciated -- due to the eventuality). The saving grace of the tool are the other usual SWK attachments - the small knife, scissors, especially... otherwise, why carry this clunker?????"
4,Some of her best.,"Overall this is a pretty good collection from ""Bonnie Raitt"". It's missing a few tracks of course, but most of the good stuff is here. The first 4 songs are off her huge ""Nick Of Time"" album, and are some of her best known. Plus this also includes ""Something To Talk About"" and ""I Can't Make You Love Me"", which is one of my favorites, as well as many other great, but lesser known songs. I really wish this also had ""Cry On My Shoulder"", but with 18 tracks it's hard to complain. This should please most casual fans of this redhead, and of soft rock/blues."
5,The best of Bonnie Raitt,"Wonderful music , great Artist, shipping was fast. CD was new. I alsoliked Eagles Retun by Crystal Woman, and her other CD The Road Back.She also creates beautiful music"
3,Sure works!,"Good points: Easy to place on umrella stand, easy to fill, easy to ""roll"" off stand when empty, for sure it is heavy enough to stand the worst weather, overall good design!Not so good: Not so easy to empty....need a drain plug! Need to be able to color match to umbrella ...."
4,Big but efficient,"Offset umbrellas are difficult to anchor. They have no center of balance, so that has to be supplied by something very heavy. Cast iron or concrete would be expensive to ship and near impossible to move about. This base is very lightweight until filled with water. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to drain the water and the lid on the top could not be closed once the unit was filled. Great concept, but poor in execution. However, it does the job it was designed to do. Some design tweaking would make it perfect."
5,Superthrive,"I received the Superthrive in only a few days, and am very happy with the service. Thank you for being prompt.Anne"
2,Bogus Hokus Pokus,"I am a master gardener and have tried pretty much every additive, bio and synthetic supposed plant helper on the market. I have actually done controlled experiments with this product on 5 peppers (5 with 5 without) and found ABSOLUTELY NO difference with it. No difference at all! Im sure it has vitamins in it as it smells like one in the bottle but you can get better results with natural AZomite for a ton cheaper. Dont expect a jack in the beanstalk story because its not magic and its nothing special but a multi vitamin in a bottle. Its hokus pokus claims in my book. Just look at the label and see the circus and claims which are NOT proven or proof. Stick with good old fashioned compost and it will blow you away. FYI, the seller of this product Hydro Harrys is a great outlet with great products and selection. Its where I buy all of my hydroponic supplies and the ONLY reason I have given this 2 stars rather then 1. That has to count for somethin..."
4,Sounds good,The product seems to be nice. I am still working on it. Takes some time to say. The price looks fair.
2,Not worth the money,I bought these containers expecting them to be useful but they can only do what a non-microwavable plastic container does. I wanted something I would be able to store and then heat food in. The containers have no chip resistance so the metal is exposed and rusting on one of the three bowls. The cheap plastic lids have torn on me as well. They are now nothing more than serving dishes and small ones at that.
3,Limited Use . . .,". . . these are nice to look at - BUT - You can't put them in the dishwasher and even worse, you can't use them in the Microwave !!!"
1,Beware made in China,"I received the 6 piece Storage Bowl Set by Corelle today. The first thing I saw was, made in China and sure enough their quality control revealed itself in the small bowl.Sorry paint job that was smudged which made it look like a dent in the side of the bowl. Would not recommend to friend or foe."
1,Does not fit a 1995 A6 quattro rear brake line,"As the title suggests, I got this brake line to replace a blown one on the rear passenger side of my '96 A6 Avant quattro. Despite the picture, the item sold has two female ends (as opposed to one male and one female end which the actual part has) and is about two inches too short."
2,Chinese for Children,"This video uses songs to teach spoken Chinese tochildren. It is probably one of very few videos that aimto teach basic Chinese to non-Chinese speaking children andit makes an admirable effort to showcase non-Chinese girlsspeaking Chinese. However the video seems somewhat amateurish inits production, and more closely resembles a home video than aprofessional production, which can be disappointing consideringthe cost of this video. The teacher and students in this videoare all female; in all fairness I think the cast should have included boys as well."
2,Misleading Title,"As another reviewer commented this book should be called using the com.heaton.bot package api reference. All you learn is how to use this package of java classes, not how to actually create spiders, bots or aggregators from the ground up. I feel the title is misleading for such an expensive book. The only way I will learn what I want is to read the authors source code - which btw is very ugly however functional."
2,No good on NT or W2000!,"Beware! This product won't work with Windows NT or W2000! It only works with W98 or Me. If you have W2000 you must buy the Professional edition ... which doesn't seem to have any real additional features, it just costs ... more."
2,So much potential...,"I've had the M6 for about 6 months and, when it works, I liked it. The problem is that I spent too much time playing with the unit trying to get it to work properly.It has several Achilles heals, the biggest being the firmware upgrade cycle. You copy one of two files to it and cycle the power to the unit. It's supposed to update the firmware and allow the second file to be copied.It's always been a dicey process, frequently failing for the first few trys. The most recent try has apparently killed the unit completely. It's dead, and won't complete the upgrade, nor accept a charge to continue trying.The other problems were sticking keys, and the very difficult method used to delete tracks. I listen to podcasts and remove them after use. It's very difficult to do. It's a shame that their isn't a dedicated key, or key stroke sequence that can be used without looking carefully at the unit.Would I buy another. No. There are too many in the marketplace that just work.Good try though."
4,Great Bass. Great Speaker.,"I have two of these puppies and was sold with the 99.99 shipped a piece.Tried these out and let me tell you they are ALMOST as good as the L7.The L7 is still a better speaker [better built, better handling].But this is still close.I've juiced these twelves with KickerZX1000 and also RockfordTB1000.1The Rockford outperformed the kicker in case you're wondering.Great performance, great speaker, kicker amps not so much..."
3,newscaster april,"its a cute APRIL from the 1990s some call it the sexy APRIL. but its a nice one if you don,t have one you should get one."
4,Great Book,"I've got 3D Lighting and Rendering as well, and I like this book alot better, simply because he explains things a little better.. he's straight forward and shows you how things are done. The explinations on the different types of light types and properties are great.. I believe this is a must own for any LW user."
2,Slightly,"When it stays stuck, it works moderately well. My cats seem to think that removing it is fun, so it doesn't stay. I'm not sure this is a fair measure, but I can see a dog removing it with ease, too."
5,Great for what it does,"It does what it does. Nice touch is that the sticky part is not overly sticky so when I had to pull it off to reset it on the second try, it came off easily enough. Once I pushed it down though it stayed put. It's an ugly brown color but it works."
2,Good sock but stinky feet,I got these socks for my husband because he loves his other compression socks. Boy were we surprised at how stinky his feet were at the end of the day when he wore these socks! They're comfy and soft and I will recommend them if you have a desk job (you don't sweat much) and you keep your shoes on. :)
3,Ball Hitch,"Be careful, the diameter of the bottom part is really big. Wouldn't fit the hitch on either of my vehicles."
1,Very disappointed,"I expect a high quality product from Master Lock as I have bought many of their products during my 60 years. This hitch ball is a great idea but the quality is poor in my opinion. Mine came with two balls both the same size, instead of one 1 7/8"" and one 2"" ball I got two 1 7/8"" ones. One of the balls looked pretty well made the other one looked poorly made. The ball receiver has lots of machining marks, not what I consider well made. I then noticed ""Made in China"" on the package, another high quality product once made in the USA is now made in China. I won't trust my trailer and safety to a Chinese hitch. I'm returning mine and I plan to buy another brand made in the USA. Master Lock you lost a lifelong customer."
3,gold tone watch,This watch is good for general time keeping it is just an average watch in that I like a watch which I do not have to reset each month and readjust for DST twice a year
2,You learn almost nothing,"You learn almost nothing from this atlas unless you have forexample ""Starry Night Backyard"" or the""Pro-version"" of the outstanding planetariumprogram forPC... or any other referensematerial.In ""Starry Night""you can get information of the stars you gaze at either on the sky orin the sky atlas 2000.0. But without a refensseguide (with the NAMESof the stars and DSO's I dont see any good reason to buy Sky Atlas2000. Or is there something I did'nt get about how to use this (for afact) beautiful and by all other means well made book?"
2,Caught no crickets...with 4 traps in the same room.,"We're in the process of renovating one of our rooms and have stripped the floors and the walls. In the process, a couple of crickets have come to visit. We put 4 of these traps in the room and caught no crickets, one spider, and a very surprised and frustrated mouse, over a 4 week period. At times I'm pretty sure the cricket(s) were sitting right next to the trap, or at least it sounded that way."
4,works well,"funny think is as soon as I posted a negative review all the traps were catching critters. This works well.. reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is somewhat dependant on placement - i couldnt catch one really annoying cricket until i moved it 10 inches directly in front of a crack in the wall. Otherwise so far each trap has caught a few crickets, millipedes, and bunch of spiders."
5,lots of fun,"Both of my six-month twins love the Johnny Jump Up, especially the boy. It works even better in combination w/a standup mirror. I can't compare it to other jumpers, but it seems well-made & well-designed."
1,DANGEROUS,"We bought this product 1 wk. ago. Our son just turned 4 mos. old. He loved being put in the jumper and quickly learned how to manipulate his body in order to move himself around in it. By the end of the first week, I put him in it and turned my back for a second to put a pillow under him. In that split second my 4 mo. old fell and let out an earth-shattering scream. All 4 straps had come out of the holes. When assembling the jumper for the first time I questioned whether or not it would hold. The straps are simply looped through a hole. I wish I had followed my motherly insticts!!"
2,it's ok...,"This item is just ok. I prefer the fisher price jumperoo. For one, it doesn't seem that comfortable, plus it is a pain to hang in the doorway. Also, it is a pain to take down from your doorway, so you are constantly having to shove it out of the way when you don't take it down. I guess the only thing nice about it is that it is a space saver..."
3,my baby is still too small for it,"it only fits in some of my door frames, also my baby is smaller she is only 13 lbs at 5 months the spring seems like it is too stiff for her to really jump. she still likes to chew on it and tries to walk around in it. good for the price."
2,AKA the Johnny Sit 'n' Dangle,"Okay, so I chintzed out and bought the cheaper doorway jumper. I wish I hadn't: the spring on this thing is so stiff that there's no way that my baby could make it jump. She just sits there dangling and looking unhappy. If you want to avoid disappointment, definitely buy the more expensive brand."
2,Hard to get in and out of.,I would not buy this product because it is difficult to get my four month old in and out of.
5,Satire was good and Action exciting,"My order came quickly and was in perfect condition. I have purchased many books by the autor, and enjoyed them all."
2,cremains,"... no actually it's not to terribly bad. i was expecting a lot worse but it wasn't to bad of a movie. had 4 short stories like such movies as creep show, nightmares, terror tract and so on. two of the short stories were pretty good and one was just an excuse for a ridiculous amount of nudity. but all in all it's worth checking out, decent flick for an independent film."
2,Disappointing,"Far too many examples that just list the chord sequences of songs.No Index so good luck on finding what you need.There is almost no discussion about why a particular chord sequence works or the melody or rhythm context it is used in.Some typical stuff on how to substitute chords and a few good sections here and there, but no depth.A bunch of examples with none of them throughly worked through."
2,Not the best mahjongg game out there.,"Any way you cut it, solitaire mahjongg is a fun game. But this version is disappointing, for several reasons. There is no timer, which takes away the competitive element of the game. There are no sound effects when you score a match, so it's a little too quiet. The music track doesn't play once the game starts, so what's the point? I liked the Greek and Egyptian tile sets that were included, but try one of the other games on the market instead."
1,Geometry,"Book wasn't of much use. My daughter has dyslexia of numbers, and this book was not of any use to her. Really the product itself is fine, it just did not benifit someone who needs special needs in the book."
3,Not widescreen?,So these are not available in widescreen? I'm wondering if the box set of all 5 seasons has Seasons 1 & 2 in widescreen?
4,quality,"If you enjoy Six Ft. Under, no disappointments here. Just as good as the original run. However, the DVDs do come in a pop-up sort of display packaging and my Season 2 set was ripped so that there was no pop-up effect. No matter, the DVDs themselves were intact."
3,be careful,The product name is misleading....it says 24K gold it is NOT SOLID it is PLATED!!!! But I have no complaints about the company. They were quick to send it out in the first place and I had NO problems what so ever in sending it back and getting a refund. They stand by their products and YOUR satisfaction. I'd buy from them again but this time I KNOW the jewelry is silver plated. Just a little disappointed the item description wasn't a more up front about it.
3,I don't know?,"The best way to rate this product is mediocre.First, the construction quality is marginally acceptable. Made entirely of plastic it probably won't survive many or any drops. The remote separated around the jack when I used my professional quality Headphones -- Sony MDR-7506's.The sound quality is satisfactory. As mentioned in earlier reviews there is a slight buzz, which is only noticeable in quiet situations -- I've gotten used to it. Despite the buzz, the quality of the mp3's is fully reproduced at whatever bitrate they were encoded.The product specs say 6 hours of music are possible on an 8 cm compact disc. This is only possible if your mp3's are encoded at a very low bitrate.Another quirk that perturbed me was the fact the player would occasionally stop when my headphones were connected directly to the player, and not inline with the remote.If you can deal with some of the quirks and the mediocre construction then this is an ideal player."
3,Meh. Fine as budget item,"This is very much a starter set for shaving. The brush seems fine (I have no basis for comparison). The soap is cheap. The stand is just a piece of plastic (although any stand is much better than none). If I were to do it again, I'd buy the same brush/holder set and get different soap. If you're committed to the idea of shaving this way, don't buy this set."
4,Good deal,"Great kit, for a good price you get a brush and enough soap to last... well I don't think I've really gotten that far into the container and I've had it a few weeks now. Love the smell of the soap and it seems to do the business."
3,Convenience is KEY,"These only come with two keys for four locks. Not the most convenient. Otherwise the locks all work well, just need to get two extra keys made."
5,the christmas list,i just loved that i could get this movie. they dont have this movie on any of my tv stations and now i can watch it
5,Christmas remembrance,This movie the first time I watched it had me hooked from the first. You have to watch it just to find out who Lillian is. And the fact that the grandson reevaluates his life and realizes what is good and decent in people is uplifting. Well worth the watch. Fair warning! Have Kleenex on hand.
3,Sort of a Forest Gump 200 years ago,"The prime character, Charlie Boylen, is a scoundrel in jail seeking to coerce a pension from British secret service because of a lifetime of service. We are then taking through his exploits through British history starting from Waterloo and ending with surreptitiously interfering with labor uprisings. We conclude from the movie that Forest Gump's recollections are true. Are Charlie's?I listened to the audiobook; thought it was well written. Ending was short and clever, kinda of a long trip to get there. Indirectly an interesting view of British history of the time."
1,the worst film ever made,"Okay I love Shock-O-Rama Cinema films, but this is a piece of crap. The director doesn't know how to direct or film on camera, plus the films is just plain crap. Horrible acting, and horrible movie, better stick with barney."
3,Interesting but flighty,"While I generally enjoyed this book, I'm only giving it three stars because it's a bit goofy. Not goofy in a HAHA sense, but, goofy in a ""got hit on the head"" sense. While I enjoyed Quan's travels as well as the supporting characters, the author waxed lyrically too long and too often. While a dab of this language would have made the prose sparkle, a thick coating only made things more dull.Overall, it's worth a checkout from the library."
3,"Master piece, but...","The book can be divided into two parts:1-st: theory, philosophy of Zero Quality Control; this part is well written, gives you power to act.2-nd: samples of POKA YOKE; this part you can omit unless you will find similar problem that has been solved - old equipment, poor pictures and drawings.From my experience - use wisdom from the first part of that book to explain to your collegues ""WHY USE POKA YOKE?"", then they will find the technical solutions."
4,It is a must if you have passion for quality,"The concept of mistake proofing have been evolved since Shingo made this concept popular, but this book established its foundation. If you are passionate for quality, it is a must!"
4,OOOOOOOMMMMM LOVELY OOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM,"TRAVELLING THE SACRED SOUND CURRENT is the CD companion of the optional purchase study book of the same name. I have not read the companion book or know anything about Deborah Van Dyke's teaching. What I do know is that the CD can serve as the musical component for high level meditation/visualization. I also have played it as an ambient, atmospheric background. The results have been the same. It works. The music & sounds definitely seem to clear the air (so to speak) and impart a gentle serenity. TRAVELLING really delivers as far as facilitating meditation/vidualization--even without knowledge of the teacher or her methods. Now I'm curious to read the book--or watch the DVD if there's one available.If I were to place TRAVELLING THE SACRED SOUND CURRENT in a genre, it would be mantra & cultural fusion--my favorite musical expression.There is a lovely photo of Deborah Van Dyke standing at the seashore on the CD. She certainly radiates tranquilty & happiness."
2,jams up the reader,Sorry; I meant this for the labels I bought. I'm sure the applicator is dandyunhappy because my reader wouldn't open up after trying to read one with a sticker on it.I gave up and bought a $99 Canon printer that prints labels. Way cool printer
4,Applicator does a good job,I have used other makes but this one is very stable and accurate. I only gave it 3 stars because of cost. I believe it is a bit overpriced especially when you add in shipping.
3,Nice read ....,A thrilling Las Vegas style story. The characters seem real...very real ! Anyone who loves excitement and a good story will like this book full of both deviant and compelling characters....in a city as full of 'everything' as Las Vegas. It's hard to believe the author of this book is a brand new writer. I can't wait to read his next one. Sometimes what happens in Vegas DOES get told!
4,A classic review of 1970's Esalen,"Sadly the author has passed. However she attended and assessed Esalen in its hayday. She appeared to approach it as an investigative NY Times journalist with aggression. As she spent time there , she seemed to soften and accept their life approach. Highly recommended as a review of Esalen and to the credit of a great journalist who kept an open mind. If only we could see more journalists like this. Read the book and try a week at Esalen - it might change your life !"
5,A great read,This book is one of the best incites into the American Civil War. Detailed maps add to the immense graphical depictions of one of the biggest wars in American History. The military history of the book is well detailed and interesting to read.
5,significent life-transforming information,"Spirit Releasement therapy gives very detailed descriptions and applications of what used to be unbelieveable concepts. Now it doesn't matter if you believe them or not, you can use the ideas to rid traumatized people of left-over distress. One incest survivor I have counseled for years, who still felt bad and dirty, was able to let these feelings out in the form of an evil spirit which had entered her through the perpetrator. She then felt ""normal"", as she would have if she hadn't been abused, for the first time in 60 years. The ideas in this book can be used successfully as truths or as metafors."
1,Oh my,I bought this film for 2 bucks and instantly felt ripped off after 5 minutes. Terrible terrible production that is low budget even by porno standards. Just avoid at all costs.
4,Remington R 600 Microflex Cordless Men's Shaver,"At a reasonable price, the shaver works well, much better than the Braun we used to own."
1,These rust indeed!!!,"I've had mine for about 5 months now, possibly less. A couple of weeks ago, I noted that it smelled rusty. And indeed the bottom had already started rusting! I used this pan regularly and also noted that it does not bake evenly. I tried to keep the little rust off my food by lining it with foil before baking but it's too much trouble and I still don't feel secure. I don't think I want to use it at all anymore now. I think it will be worthwhile to invest in something pricier but of better quality. This is not worth your trouble. Or try Pyrex for other purposes."
1,HORRIBLE quality - use with caution!,"My wife and I recently got a couple of these pans for Xmas. On the second occasion that we used them, I noticed a grey color on the side of the loaf after removing it from the pan. THE NON-STICK COATING HAD COME OFF AND STUCK TO THE BREAD!!Using these pans poses a health risk! Stay far away from this brand! Other reviewers have complained that the pans rust (which they do) and this would be why. Whatever chemical coating they put on the pan comes off in your food, and you then ingest it!Thanks a lot, Baker's Secret! I'm sure it won't be long before lawsuits begin..."
4,Great for genreal use,"I use my Baker's Secret loaf pan often, mainly for my homemade banana bread.PROS:- Never warps, keeps its shape bake after bake.- Even heat distribution and baking.- Cleans up pretty well if soaked first in hot, soapy water.- Has never rusted (and I've had mine for many years).- Slightly rounded corners and edges make taking baked goods out easier, never stick.CONS:- Small handles are awkward to use oven mitts with."
1,THE BEST ADVICE YOU WILL RECEIVE TODAY (EXCEPT FOR NO ONE OVER THE AGE OF 5 SHOULD WEAR A STRIPED TEE SHIRT),"This is my good deed for the day. Save your money, increase your pleasureable hours...do not buy, watch or rent this movie. Please understand, I love movies. My favorites range from Olivia De Haviland in The Heiress to Love Actually and everything in between (ie: Harry Potter, Star Wars, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood etc etc etc). Tristam Shandy a cock and bull story was an incomprehensible mess. It was not funny, it was not interesting, it was not touching, amusing, warm or anything one wants from a movie. Even a nice scare (watch Julie Harris in the original The Haunting for a 1st class scare) is worth ones time but not this disaster of a movie.Anyway, forgive me for the aformentioned striped tee shirt warning, I could not help myself. This might be the worst movie I have seen in quite a while. It was even worse than Eragon and that was BAD."
1,What a waste of time!,"Well, that's part of my life I'll never get back! I can't figure out why this movie got such great reviews; I was totally bored by it. Don't waste your time; there are a lot of other movies out there that are better than this junk."
5,"Quirky, funny film about film","""Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story"" reminded me a bit of an Altman film--it's a story within a story about a novel being filmed--but it's really about the chaos of life. It has a bit of a amateur film feel about it, that draws one into the middle of the making of the film. The film opens with a vignette about the vanity of actors--are my teeth too yellow? do I look good with a big nose? should I get a chin tuck? am I too short? Characters move in and out, and it's not always clear who is who--the agent, the nosy journalist, the moneymen (and women), the history expert, the girlfriend, the pretty assistant, the babies. Some scenes are truly hysterical--all you need to know is that almost all of the Sterne novel happens before the narrator is born, and the filming of the birth is hilarious. This film is not for linear plot types, or those who are bothered by heavy British accents or mumbled dialog. It's sly, quirky--but I liked it much more than I expected to!"
1,Very Dissapointed,"Well, I had high hopes for this series. It sounded interesting and cool and I liked the cover art a lot. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the series at all. I found the main character boorish, whiney, loud, and stupid and I didn't care much for any of the other characters in the series(Fuku was the one I liked the best and she is in it the least) I don't care much for the artist's style and the repetitive, episodic nature of the series didn't keep my attention.I'm a big fan of romantic dramas, both shonen and shoujo alike, but I found the story to be shallow and far too slapstick(and not in the good Love Hina way)I'm glad TokyoPop is expanding into the more ""adult"" realm, but I wish they'd try another series....."
5,Good enough to steal!!!!!!!!!,"The book is awesome....so incredibly awesome that mine was stolen from my house when my house got broken into. In fact, the camcorder was left behind."
2,Boring piece of history,"Add three stars if you are a Madonna fan and you liked the videos which caused so much friction with MTV. This picture book is an over-priced work of amateur erotica, staged hollow imagery, an incoherent theme. I would recommend ""Pictures"" by Mapplethorpe if you are looking for this kind of theme, but better and more passionate photography."
4,Madonna in the 90's,"I have to give Madonna credit for being the bold artist that she was in the 90's. Her book, Sex, with it's portfolio of nude images with the combination of design and production was beyond any book I've seen. However, I don't think of this book to be erotic but an example to Madonna's metaphorosis into the artist that she is now. It's like watching someone grow through pictures. Most 80's performers didn't last as long as Madonna's as she continued to reinvent her self through her career. The Madonna today would never produce the sex book (she's writing childrens story books now). ""Sex"" captures Madonna in her most dramatic reinvention.I recommend this to any collector!"
2,To hard to clasp.,"I liked the looks of this watch; however, I returned it because it was too hard to clasp. I tried to wear the watch twice (after having someone else clasp it for me), but it fell off my wrist both times."
5,I thought this book was wonderful!,"I am a 26 year old mother of 3 kids, and am not too into reading scary books. Life is scary enough! This book is SO hard to put down! I started it at about 8:30 one night and finished it by 11:00. I wasn't scared, more like, intrigued by the goings-on in this book. Read it - however old you are - and I think you'll be glad you did."
1,"Very poor quality, don't bother","This product is cheaply made and functions poorly. It's highly visible but most of the time the mechanical bell makes only a single faint ""ding"" or doesn't sound at all at the end of the specified time, making the unit useless for its intended purpose, unless you want to sit and look at it until the time is up."
3,Biased representation,"The video focuses only on Latin America, Central America and Europe. There were countries from Africa playing in this tournaments who scored goals but none of their goals was shown. However, it is a good video. My kids loved it a lot."
2,Not that great..,"I bought this DVD for my Scottish-born husband and we were both disappointed. The title is misleading in that the goals featured were NOT that great since they were restricted to World Cup goals. In addition, this DVD was made in the 1980's which allowed for the exclusion of some AMAZING goals. Gee.. I wonder if I can return it for a refund.Very disappointing. :0("
1,Stern Dialect Monologues,"Absolute RUBBISH!!! Do not buy this horrible tape. I feel sorry for anyone who orders this disaster. This man left ""Hollywood"" years ago and has been trying to pawn off these awful tapes for years. Buyer BEWARE!!!!"
5,Great card version of Labyrinth,"My 5 year old son received this as a gift, along with the board version. We love both of them and like that the games are different enough to warrant having both versions. It's a game that is both challenging and sometimes a little frustrating for my son (but he's also younger than the suggested 7 year old age minimum). He'll be able to play it for years to come. Nice that adults can enjoy it as well. I like that the cards are small, but I do wish the box they had put it in was smaller and sturdier. The plastic green card holder inside is flimsy and ripped rather quickly and easily."
1,Very poor formatting for Kindle,"As a previous reviewer stated, the Kindle formatting for this book is very poor. Paragraphs are tabbed inconsistantly and common words like office and Chicago are hyphenated. I'm glad the book was free."
2,"Potentially good book, Bad Kindle Transfer","I can only agree with those who received a defective download of this book. Missing syllable make some of the book unintelligible. It appears to have an interesting premise, but I'm not sure I want to play a word game instead of reading a book. Too bad, all around."
4,excellent,Bill Mason played Hammond organ with Rusty Bryant in the 1970s. This is a rare opportunity to hear him leading his own recording session.
2,Many better titles on the market,"I was surprised to see that this title is still in print, almost twenty years after it was written. The first chapter of the book, on the role of pre-understanding, is valuable and worth reading. However, the rest of the book suffers from a number of flaws: overly scholarly language (as one with a Master's degree in religion, even I had trouble understanding parts of the book), a bias toward conservative interpretation, and an over-reliance on white male and especially German theologians. Liberation theology is given only a glancing mention, and feminist theology is nowhere to be found. There are newer and better texts to be found on the market, that take advantage of the diversity of voices that are being heard in theology today."
5,arrived as described:),The book arrived on time and in the exact condition it was described. I am very satisfied with my purchase and this vendor. Highly recommond this vendor:)
5,"Highly beneficial, whatever your income level and age","I've read so many books that supposedly help you get wealthy. What distinguished this book was that it puts you in the driver's seat to get you there. From the outset, the book urges you to define what wealth is to you. That resounded loudly with me; the authors didn't foist upon me their definition of wealth. They explain that it's not necessarily a set dollar figure, it depends on what you personally are trying to achieve. The worksheets in the back of the book are invaluable and I would highly recommend that anyone serious about setting up a financial plan fill them out. They help you focus on what you have and where you want to get to financially. The real-life case studies in the book confirm for me that the advice is tried-and-true. I'm glad I found this book while I'm still pretty young and it can really impact my investment program. It seems like a very sensible approach to help propel me to where I want to be."
5,"Touching, Inspirational, Energizing.","From personal experience I know that volunteer work can seem pretty thankless. There's never enough funds, seldom many offers of help, and frequently an abundance of criticism. ""Chicken Soup for the Volunteer's Soul"" is the best cure for volunteer burnout I've seen. The stories are touching and inspirational, sure to intensify the intrinsic rewards of working to help humanity. Without reservation I recommend this, along with all other books by Tom and Laura Lagana.Paul Karsten Fauteck, Psy.D.Forensic Psychologist, former prisoner, and author ofGoing Straight: An Ex-convict/Psychologist Tells Why and HowandGet It Right!."
5,great game,"Love this game, the pieces are sturdy and it's fun to play. Little girls especially like it obviously because you have to find puppies. My girls loved it"
2,A Dud,"I was a fan of Tom Browne during the early eighties, his heyday, and found many of his recordings in line with much of the jazz fusion of that time. When purchasing this CD, I mistakenly thought that it was the original ""Funkin for Jamaica"" album which was a good album, instead of a compilation. The tracks chosen for this CD lean heavily on the pop-jazz end, and fails to demonstrate any of Mr. Browne's acumen on the trumpet. Except for ""Funkin for Jamaica"" and one other track, this CD is very forgetful."
2,An absolute shambles of a CD,"I adore The Beatles and own every boxset and most bootlegs ever released. However, this ""sound collage"" is virtually unlistenable, fraught as it is with interposed noises and sounds. The interviews themselves, such as they are, can be found elsewhere with higher clarity and fewer bizarre effects.If you want to confuse a Beatles fan, put this CD on. Otherwise, the only use I can find for it is as a coaster. Not recommended."
5,Not just for Queens,I read about this book in Out Magazine and bought it for a recent trip to Orlando. It was just great. It's also really funny. And I dont think you would have to be gay or lesbian to really appreciate and use the book to get the most out of your Disney vacation. Highly recommended.
4,alot to offer,"the game is easy once you get the hang of it, and can be very time consuming. its a strategy game that requires alot of guessing, and planing ahead, if you liked the gba games youll like this. each character has his own theme, and theirs even a level designer, i think it takes to long to create a half way decent level though."
4,I love this game,"nintendo has outdone itself with the ds, and this game utilizes all of the great features. graphics are excellent!"
1,Big dissapointment,"What a mean little book! After AMERICAN STUDIES and AN ARROW'S FLIGHT, each in its own way very well written and rewarding, Mark Merlis has little to offer this time out except a central character who seems not so much real as he is a cliched vehicle for the author's contempt for the people he writes about, their world, and his own themes."
3,Not Bad,"I always wonder when I'm reading books with ..., sad-sack characters: are we supposed to sympathesize with this person, or is he being written about as an object of satire? Does the author identify with this character, or is it more of a cautionary tale? The main character of this book is pretty unredeemable (if a book is supposed to be about the most interesting character a writer can imagine on the most important day of his life, well, this book doesn't hold up). And, to be frank, not much happens. That said, it's well written and occasionally insightful. I finished it, which is saying something when it comes to most gay books. Would I recommend it? Not really, unless maybe you're a big fan of the author. And for what it's worth, my partner feels exactly the same way."
5,Everything Eartha,"This is an amazing collection. Three full length wonderfully remastered cd's containing 50 of Eartha's best. The set contains most of the tracks found on Miss Kitt, To You, Purr-fect: Greatest Hits, and The Bad Eartha/Down to Eartha, plus a whole lot more. This is the best compilation you can get, short of buying the 5 cd Eartha Quake box set."
5,Loved this novel,"Great story. Couldn't put it down. Only a few novels have captured my imagination and caught my attention as I've read them, this was one of them."
4,performance well done,I AM WRITING TO YOU TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CD. I ENJOYED MOST OF THESE SONGS AND I OWN A COPY OF THIS CD. I THINK THE COVER COULD OF DONE BETTER BUT ITS ALRIGHT FOR NOW. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS CD AND WAS SURPRISED OF HOW MUCH HARD WORK IT MUST OF TOOK TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS CD. BIG HUGE CONGRADULATIONS TO ALL THE ARTISTS AND PRODUCERS WHO HAVE A HIT SINGLE ON HERE. I THINK YOU GUYS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB.ANONYMOUS.
1,How to read music:reading music made simple,CD was missing. I have written to the shop but no answer. I would like to have CD also with the book. CD is very essential!!
5,Summer Camp Memories,"I was recently in the play Alladin, and whenever there was a break, the whole cast would gather to play ""Encore."" We used songs from the musical we were in-and talk about a boatload of laughs! It's a blast! Everyone loves it, because everyone gets involved, and has a great time. This is a fabulous party game! Buy it now!"
4,5 Encore Games,"The board games came quickly and were well wrapped and in good condition when they arrived, except for one. For some reason that individual box was dented. It appeared to me that it was damaged before shipping, as the outer box looked fine."
4,Fun Music Game,"I enjoy this game a lot, but it can be hard if you aren't a music buff. Object is to quote 6 words from a song containing the word given. Teams go back and forth each round until one team is out of songs. Some words are harder than others!"
4,"Good, almost-clean fun!","This is a great game for 9 and 10 year olds, although some of the words may be on the inappropriate side for them, and at their age, they're starting to enjoy making up inappropriate songs. Don't want to stunt their creativity, but if grown-ups are playing along, it could be good teaching moment."
5,Much better than the older versions!,"I had the version of this game before it and like it...but felt like it was lacking.And this version fixed that! It now has a board instead of a notepad, pieces, and it is easier to see the final goal and see how you are doing.It is a really fun game to play with friends and family. Even if they aren't music buffs they will enjoy it!My favorite thing is that you can repeat cards in different games unlike so many games that are over once you have done all the cards. It works multiple times because you never know what songs you will think of!Overall it is a great game!"
5,Would you like MLA or APA with that?,"""Writing Research Papers: A complete Guide"" is essential to those who write these papers often. The first 130 pages serve as a basic review of Information and rot Data collection mixed with organizational schemes, parallelism and whatnot. The last 250 pages discuss in detail Modern language Association (MLA) format and American Psychological Association (APA) format research papers. I personally recommend that you buy the tabbed book, while it is more expensive; it provides easy access to the very difficult APA Reference page material and data. In all honesty, the only real importance to this book is the APA materials, as MLA is intrinsically easy, and most people who pick up this book have already dealt with the basic material, which is at the front of the book. This book offers some use to the more experienced research paper writers, and exponentially more to those with less experience."
2,Disappointment,"Sorry to disagree with most reviewers but this album needs a rhythm section to make it brilliant.The songs are well written but they lack the production of orchestration. A piano, bass, and drums backing up the acoustic guitars would have made this CD better. Most of the reviewers say that this was ND's best album but I have to disagree. All of the tunes here are of the same sound: acoustic guitar and voice."
4,Good Costume Addon,"I purchased a mid-high quality holster and these ""bullets"" really made it pop. Individually, the rounds show cast seams and aren't that impressive, but when added to a gun belt, they really finish off the effect.If you are going someone where on one will care, I would recommend purchasing a box of .22s for about $0.15-0.20 per round, but this product is great for your older kids or for plays, etc"
2,another negative review -- look at it before you buy it,"i don't have much to add to the other negative reviews -- maps that are unusable because they're too small and black and white, organization thats just doesn't work, and so on. the book looks like its one step above a photocopied typewritten manuscript. look at rick steves for another book that has no color yet works well -- especially the maps. theres so many paris guide books out there, almost any of which are better than this one"
4,Sarah Schulman borrows from Kurt Vonnegut,"I bought this book after reading ""Girls, Visions & Everything"" and was initially disappointed in the characters in this book. Schulman abandons the gay urban setting, trading it for the age of McCarthyism. However, after reading a few chapters, I began to get immensely drawn into the narrative. The writing is amazing, linking different characters from different times and places into one cohesive story. The ability to see the events from many perspectives is creative and interesting.The book reminded me a great deal of ""Slaughterhouse Five"" in its seemingly disconnected events that later are drawn together into one larger story."
1,dont waste your time,"waste of money and time, look at a underware magazine for free! l l l l l l l l"
1,What happened to the quality of these socks?,"I have been buying Gold Toe Socks for a long time, and up until recently, I have been very happy with their quality and durability. Recently though, I've noticed they are developing holes in them way more quickly. I haven't been doing anything different that previous, but they seem to be way more prone to developing holes in the heel area. What's worse is that I just opened a brand new package of these socks, and there's already a big whole in one of the seam areas after wearing them once!I won't be purchasing these socks anymore. I'm going to search for socks of better quality. I'm very disappointed."
1,A Dissapointed Fan,I heard there were actually real recordings of The Prince of Preachers. I was not counting on this to be among them. But I did expect the man preaching in Spurgeon's steed to be British. And with all due respect I have heard better drama in junior high schools. I feel as if I have been lied to. I will admit that it will be nice to listen to Spurgeon's words in my car and at work. But beyond that I am quite disappointed in the publisher and the company that sold me the tape.
3,It was OK,I thought this was fun but to simalar to mario party 6. Though i never played mario party 7 my friend said she played at her friends house and she said it had almost the same thing as mario party 6 but she said it was very fun and enjoyable wall it lasts.but me and my friend played mario party 6 and that was so much fun. i loved it when i got the star which gave me extra points. You might not know what i am talking about unless you played mario party 6.
1,A book for beginners,"I bought this book with the hope that it would help me improve my guitar recordings. Which, in a very vague way this book might help someone who has never recorded. What I was looking for in this book was mixing ""recipes"" for eq and compression. I realize that there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to these areas but I hoped it would give a starting point for my mixes.If this book would have been out about 30 years ago it would have gotten a decent review. However, a beginner might find better information on a guitarist web forum."
4,Muir is crazy!,"This book tells of several adventures that John Muir had in his life. It confirms that the guy was a bit of a lunatic, but it makes for enjoyable reading. Some of the stories are better than others, but at least they are short and easy to read."
1,The Wild Muir,"This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame."
2,Dr. Michael Steward,"This is a quality book that is down to earth and easy to absorb. The methods in this book definitely work. Dr. Steward recently taught a summer camp for our organization and the students were very excited with his teaching. I asked one of our members to give me her opinion of his teaching after the first class. She came back and stated ""this man knows more than anyone I ever met. I want to train with him."" I highly reccomend Dr. Steward and his book to anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge about the Chinese arts."
1,Not worth it,"Maybe I shouldn't review this book because I only got about 60% through it. In doing so I not only failed to find any interesting weather processes (I am a weather hobbyist), but I could not find any characters to give a hoot about. If you like weather fiction, read LUCIFER'S HAMMER or DOOM WIND. The same is true if you want real characters with understandable responses to trouble."
1,"good film,on a rotten vhs tape","I bought this ntsc tape resently and it was brand new factory sealed,well this is a good film worth watching,but I have seen better 1980`s exrental tapes,this vhs tape was the pits,how any studio can sell rubbish copies like this is a crime,some vhs are ok but if this is what the last of vhs is like bring on blu ray"
1,Amateurish Production with Short Content,"I bought this based upon the reviews here. However, the DVD is definitely not worth the $22 I paid considering the amateurish graphics and production (with grating guitar solos), and limited content. Often, the moves do not correspond with the brief game highlights and local league players being filmed for a few seconds. I found the Manchester U DVD far above this in quality and content (and on that one you get to see actual pros doing the moves)."
2,very basic,"I bought this dvd for my brother. he's 14 and he actually knew already all the moves they talk about here.There is nothing special in the moves. you can find better video tutorials in youtube. they mention the basic moves like zidan's roulette (they call it different) or the scissors.I mean, if you have never played football then you should buy this dvd, otherwise it's a waste of money."
4,Just what I was looking for,"Needed a simple video instruction for my 10 year old who's not getting a lot of instruction from his coaches on footwork. Read all the reviews on this video, good and bad, and took a chance. It did exactly what it said; demonstrated from various angles some very cool moves such as scissors and reverse scissors, and lots of others that I can't remember the name of. My son and I watched a few the day it arrived and went out to practice. We both picked them up right away. There are some moves they demonstrate later in the video that look identical to others they demonstrate previously, so realistically, you don't get as many moves as you think, but the few are still great. This is stuff that your soccer coaches should be teaching your kids but if they are not, this video is worth every dime."
4,nice,It was good but not the game I had before. I think it was the next year game that I want to buy tho
1,"Good concept, but poorly executed","This slim volume is a hodge-podge of information about Asheville that is poorly organized and written in an affected style that makes it difficult to glean useful information. The maps included in the book are inadequate and are more akin to something drawn on the back of a paper napkin than what one would expect from a published guide. Photographs included in the book are of very poor quality, and sadly do little to enhance the quality of the book. The book specifically excludes B&B's and other possible lodging accommodations, which is intentional on the authors' part but seems a major omission in a book with such ambitions. Asheville's proximity to exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities is one of its biggest draws, but the authors do a very poor job describing them. [...]"
2,Not Yet Completely Tired of Waiting,"I purchased this DVD on the strength of the positive reviews and I may have been drinking , also. For the hardcore Kinks' fan this may satisfy, for me not so much. It's really just a bunch of videos, none earth shattering. I have a bootleg DVD of the Kinks, Jan. 72, BBC broadcast from the Rainbow Theater in London. That is the type of stuff I'm longing for. There must be that & more that could be released. As with all these groups from the 60's, they need to get the product out as their fan base with disposable income is dying or losing interest. So it's bootlegs or youtube, check out Ray Davies singing Waterloo Sunset at the Roundhouse..... that's what I'm talking about."
4,Good for the beginner...,"This is a good video for the absolute beginner. It teaches you how to tune, and how to play a few chords. I wouldn't recommend it if you've played guitar before. Buy this if you're a beginner, but also buy step two along with it."
4,Spanish Nouns at a Glance,"This is a book intended for kids, but it can be useful for kids and adults alike. As an adult, I purchased this book to brush up on my Spanish. I find pictures and organization make the memorization process easier.There are more than 1,500 words covered, in 32 sections. Usually, the theme of the section is expressed through a large scene, in which the individual items can be seen. They are also separately shown, with English and Spanish description. I was happy to see that there were bilingual glossaries and that the Spanish-English one gives Spanish pronunciations.This dictionary primarily concerns nouns, with use of the proper Spanish article; there are merely one section on verbs and one section on prepositions and adjectives. Many say it is more important to focus on verbs, language structure, and idioms, and that is fine. But I find it great to have such a quick reference for frequently used nouns."
1,Not exactly what they described,"Instead of receiving hooded robe, we got a robe and a hood, and they are separated!(refer to the customer pic)Imaging that my son have to grab the chain and pick up the hood during the Holloween parade......The chain is not attached to the robe. (Does this costume require customer to sew them with the needle and thread?)I wondered if this is the DIY kit!?Totally disappointed!"
3,My son loved it,It was fair quality but you get what you pay for...it held up so I was happy and so was my son
3,Average,DVD: is ok regarding its quality and subtitleBluray: there is a huge defect regardind its screen ratio. Despite a bluray disc when playing its not widescreen.
1,Not The Best Of Heath,"The music is dated. Not one of the latest band versions by Heath. Music is more like early forties or late thirties. Heath has made many better recordings shortly before his death. Look of these albums to really get the full appreciation of his music.In The Lounge indicates ""Listen To My Music, Heath's theme song, is part of the menu. It is merely a few spoken thoughts from Heath with a few bars of the theme."
3,Skin and Bones,Skin and Bones being a live accoustic album with Foo Fighters and was released 2006. The booklet contains many photographs from the live concerts but apart from this it is quite sparse. In fact one could accuse Sony BMG of being a bit cheap since we get no linernotes and the photographs look like a friend of the band shot them and not a professional photographer. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave the album 3/5 in their reviews. 3/5.
2,"Good music, bad language","I bought this as a gift for my 16 yr. old who enjoys the Foo Fighters, but regretted it when I saw even the 1st 10 minutes of the disk. During the banter between songs, the F-word is repeatedly used. This might be okay for older listeners, but in households with younger children, I wouldn't recommend it. It was disappointing because the music itself is good."
5,Great resource for newcomers and veterans alike,"Although I've been working in direct mail for nearly seven years, I got some great ideas from this book. But it will also provide an excellent overview of direct mail for anyone who's new to the field. This book covers everything you'll need to know: planning your campaign, choosing your offer(s), renting mailing lists, copywriting, design, testing and more. Even if you've never done a single direct mailing, this book--loaded with practical tips and proven advice--will help you hit the ground running.If your objective is lead generation, I would also recommend another Bob Bly book--The Lead Generation Handbook. There's a fair amount of overlap between the two books, though, so if you only need to know about direct mail as it pertains to lead generation, definitely go with The Lead Generation Handbook."
2,A Poor Production Job,"This is no doubt an important book by a respected expert in the subject matter. The problem is that the book is poorly manufactured and, therefore, extremely difficult to read. It runs to 1136 pages in only one volume. It weighs 3.4 pounds. To get it all in one volume, the publisher chose an extremely small type face, 10 or 11 point at most. The copy I received had two damaged pages which is not surprising since the binding is too flimsy to withstand the stresses of handling such a lengthy tome. The book deserved to appear in two volumes and in a readible type face with a strong binding. It is really a shame. Wiliam J. Potts, Jr."
3,Cool game for a few rounds,My kids liked this game at first but got bored quickly after a few rounds. I don't know if it was because it was too simple for them or what. The toy is very sturdy and would be perfect for younger kids learning to count.
4,Lovely to look at...,"I loved the first half of this book. It's filled with dreamy mosquito netted fantasy rooms and is a real delight to look at. The second half,in general, seemed to feature more contrived sort of interiors, a little bit too over the top for me. Overall a really pretty book full of lovely pictures and a totally different world. A must for anyone with rustic/tribal/colonial sort of tendencies. I must admit I haven't read a great deal of the text yet so I can't comment on that, but it's the pictures that make this sort of book worthwhile and there are plenty of those."
3,Zack G is in a scene or two.,This film is very funny for the first twenty minutes. Then it turns into Saw 2. I recommend watching till the killing starts.
1,Horrible Movie,"This has to go down as one of the worst movies ever. I rented it because it had some notable actors, however the movie was just absolutely terrible."
1,1 star is generous...,"Like many others, I watched this movie because the story sounded interesting enough, the flashy cover reminded me movies I'd seen previously and big Zach was right up front. That guy is pure comedic gold, right? RIGHT?Wrong...While Zach's minor time on the screen playing the same aloof, out of touch character as always fits him...the rest of the movie was unfortunately a waste. And while there will be defenders of this film claiming that this is a black comedy, the only thing that's black is the hole in my soul where happiness used to reside until this movie devoured it.I kept watching with the hope that somehow the movie would eventually redeem itself. With a cast like this you'd think SOMEONE could make this movie worthwhile.In the end I'm left wishing the cover would have been as bland as the movie and saved myself the torture of watching it...At least there's still hope for you. Flee now!"
1,AN UNENJOYABLE PILE OF CRAP,"About this film:- Bad acting- Not funny. The comedy timing is off most of the time. I did crack a smile, but only twice!- Boring"
5,I found it funny.,"I found it funny in a somewhat dark sense of humor. Assassins locked up and hating each other in an underground bunker? Why not. It's not like an AMAZING movie ever made but it made me laugh. Rent if first, watch it, and if your like me (I buy movies IIIII like) then purchase it. :)"
3,Mikati's first giant step,"Seventy-nine minutes of mindless froth that, on second viewing, was slightly more entertaining than the first. I believe this is director Fouad Mikati's first film (and hopefully last?) and he goes at it with gusto as do the cast who seem to be enjoying themselves doing nothing in particular and they get paid for it, too.Rob Corddry hams it up best of all and Ellen Barkin, Odette Annable plus Emilie de Ravin provide the eye candy. Zach Galifianakis seemed rather out of place as if he strolled onto the set from some other production nearby. Ving Rhames and Jeffrey Tambor have so little time on screen that their talents are wasted.The two teams of assassins slug it out in an underground bunker and that really is all there is to it except that the death of each seems to provide vicarious thrills to each killer. The storyline is so paper-thin that I can't see how the production could be anything other than fun froth."
4,Comprehensive and lots of sample test questions.,"With over 1300 pages, a cd-rom full of sample test questions and lab exercises, if this book doesn't cover the material for exam 70-165 then I'm not sure what else does. There are the usual ""rush-to-publisher"" edit errors, but not as many as I've seen in other MCSD study guides. I'm half way through it and quite satisfied with it so far."
3,The ghost B.C.,"Worth a couple of bucks to watch if you like that kind of 80's movie feel and cheezy acting. Fairly good story, adequete horror effects, nice little bit of tension, and intentionally or unintentionally funny. either way good cheap entertainment for that old school movie buff."
2,Good for beginners,"This book is good for beginners, but simply does not have anything for more advanced developers,...."
3,Could've been so much better...,"This is definately an interesting take on Tool's dynamic music. Tool is one of those bands that deserves to have tributes written to them, but none will ever match up with the real thing. This string tribute feels hollow and empty. I believe one of the reasons is there is no percussion. Danny Carey's awesome drumming is not something you can overlook, especially when writing a tribute albumn. They really should've included some sort of percussion on this album. For the best possible record, they should've had tool playing WITH the orchestra, yeah it'd be like Metallica, I know, but it still would've sounded a lot better."
1,Tool on strings poorly arranged,"I am a huge fan of Tool, a huge fan of Classical music, and a huge fan of string based classical music. This CD was a HUGE dissappointment. The arrangement was very poorly thought out. If you are trying to get your partents interested in Tool, it may be OK at best. Aenima was an incredible piece. The rest lacked the classical arrangement that I would have expected from the band. This CD had so much more potential. It really lacked the depth and complexity that the band delivers. Even the limitations within a string arrangement could have portrayed Tools power, depth and layering better than this CD did."
1,Doesn't do Tool justice,"Maynard and the boys put a whole lot more work into layering their compositions than this dinky string quartet did. Though well-done classical Tool would blow me away, doing it right requires a full-out symphony orcestra. Ever heard the London Philharmonic do Pink Floyd? Yeah, like that."
1,Poor quality,purchased this light for a christmas gift and found one of the halogen lights burned out and hardware kit missing. returned immediately.
5,A must for every beginner fencer!,"This book for me had been very helpful because I'm a beginner fencer and I received a deep information about fencing that only experienced masters as master Evangelista know how to transmit. Also, I found interesting things about fencing that I never read before. Furthermore, I highly recommend this book for every beginner fencer who wants to become and experienced and a knowledgeable fencer"
2,"Once great socks, now not even WalMart quality","After 20 years of being a Gold Toe loyal customer I find myself throwing out the last dozen pairs I purchased in June because of the very poor quality, in particular they simply will not stay up.Too bad, another good name down the drain."
4,are these really athletic socks?,"i wear them with soccer cleats and possibly due to the heavy running and stopping, the material seems to have become fragile and loose. for soccer, it may be a better choice to buy adidas or nike socks that are designed for soccer."
2,Nice socks..but,"Love the socks but the socks like to shed pilings all over my carpet, especially when my husband takes them off. Little pieces of wool all over the carpet. Have to vacuum every 3 days."
3,A little vague,"This book helped me learn some good stuff, but at times it didn't give me enough help to get the concept."
2,Shiny and pretty but not much else.,"The scale is very sleek and stylish. It goes will in my bathroom and is relatively unobtrusive and easy on the eyes. As far as decorations go, not terrible.The scale itself is not very accurate. I weigh myself 10 minutes apart with no changes and my weight changes by 2-3 pounds. This is not a big deal in and of itself, but I wish there was a bit more precision in a DIGITAL scale.Additionally, I have found that when two people of similar but different (10-15 pound difference) weigh themselves one after the other, the scale registers the same value for both. I feel like there is some sort of artificial ""memory"" built in which is troubling.Overall, I am somewhat unhappy with the product."
2,sketchers,Sketchers were much too heavy. Did not like the deep groves in soles. They didn't stay on my feet.
2,Skechers clog,No problem with the delivery. The actual clog is very heavy and each step is a battle to keep the shoe on. After wearing them for a very short time my legs and feet began to hurt!
4,"A great ""gift"" for your supervisors and managers!","Everyone can benefit from improved leadership skills, but it's sometimes difficult to take criticism constructively. This book provides managers with a lot of food for thought, broken down into managable lists. If your managers need a little help improving their leadership skills, buy them a copy of this book. I keep a copy of the book on my desk and re-read one list each day. When conducting Leadership Seminars, I have used some of the lists to initiate group discussions."
4,Understanding how Jehovah's Witnesses destroy families.,"This book was a real eye-opener for me in that I discovered how Jehovah's Witnesses truly go about bringing people into their organization . . .and the power that the local Jehovah's Witness elders have over the converts and members.I liked this book because it's a 'down to earth' kind of story where I, as the reader, could truly 'see' the various and interesting characters described by the author. And, I felt absorbed in the story of Jack and Susan. Escaping the psychological hold of their Jehovah's Witness stepfather they run away from their home in Michigan and make it across the country to the Florida Everglades, where their natural father works as a marine biologist, only to be confronted with near death experiences.This story is not only informative but highly entertaining."
3,"Good, some issues","Head set is comfortable and works well for the user. Callers on other end complain of ""feed-back"" or hearing their own conversation when used with some phones."
2,Seems to be made of cheap materials.,"It's only been a few months since I bought this shaver, but already one of the cutters often doesn't rotate, the mustache trimmer is broken, and the silver paint near the top is peeling off. The shaver provides an excellent shave but it seems to be made of cheap materials."
4,The Short Course to Winning Hockey Strategies,This book covers most aspects of strategic play and principles in all zones of the ice and situations likely to be encountered by coaches involved in the Novice to Peewee categories of ice hockey. The explanations and diagrams are easy to follow and would also be useful to the arm chair enthusiasts who desire to upgrade their understanding and appreciation of the viewing of the game. The basic principles are well illustrated and the more complex strategies are avoided which serves to keep things simple and easily digestable. Some of the jargon tends to be specific to the author's locale but generally is well explained.
2,Totally unexciting.,"Having been to Spain and enjoyed Spanish cooking, I was very disappointed with this book. The presentation was frankly boring and the recipes generally uninspiring. The narrative giving the background to the recipes was the most interesting part of the book, but was not the reason for buying it.I am always sceptical of recipes that rely on a single common ingredient for their uniqueness. In this case Penelope Casas appears to want us to believe that using Kosher salt will make a difference and make pretty ordinary recipes somehow Spanish. I cannot believe that many if any of the characters in the book kept Kosher salt (whatever that is) in their kitchens or that Penelope Casas or anyone else would be able to tell the difference between the dishes in the book cooked with Kosher, sea or ordinary table salt.There must be better Spanish cookery books about!Mike Smith"
5,"Still ""Magic Blue Bottle"" to me!","I got a horrible deep knee injury when I was a child, and the pediatrician told mom to trickle a little ST-37 right down into the wound. I expected it to burn like everything else did -- but it dramatically lessened the pain.For my own kids, there was ""Magic Blue Bottle"" for everything from burns to toothaches and sore throats.It kind of dropped out of sight in our part of the country for a few years. I am just tickled to find it online just in time for the grandchildren!"
5,st 37 is a great antiseptic,I love this product and I too couldn't find it anymore. It is a great sunburn relief product but it is also just a great antiseptic and it doesn't burn like alcohol. I wish the makers would step up and get the product back out there so we don't have to search for it!
5,terrific brutal album,"This is a slab of 41+ minutes of brutal death metal. Thick guitars, fast drumming and blast beats aplenty all add to the ripping, brutal experience that is Mark of the Legion.Guttural, low vocals complement the brutal instrumental onslaught to perfection.The intro to An Eternity Of Feasting And Brawling shuold alone make you cringe as you await the onslaught of brutality.All in all this album reminds me of Pierced From Within by Suffocation, a heavy slab of brutal death."
3,"Caution, ""Bark"" turns out to be green","To be fair, these pants are pretty nice and would rate 5 if not for the misleading photo, which looks to be light brown. Turns out they are green. Someone else described it as ""Olive Drab"" which is pretty accurate. Too bad I didn't see that review before I ordered. There is another version of color ""Loden"" that looks far closer to the color described as ""Bark"" here. I'm sending this pair back as it is not a color I am fond of.I did get a pair in ""Slate"" that fits well and will likely outlast others. The fit seemed pretty accurate, maybe just a little tighter in the waist than another same size pair of Wranglers of a different model. The Slate is a bit darker than it appears in the photo."
5,Great work pants,"I bought these pants for my son to wear to work, and he loves them. He loves the lightness and durability of the fabric and especially all the pockets for his ""stuff"". I already ordered another pair."
1,Disappointing,I had some Ralph Lauren firm pillows for years before they were finally worn out and needed to be replaced. I purchased this for way more $$$ than my original pillows and found the quality to be seriously lacking. It was completely flat and worthless within two months. Very disappointed and will not purchase again.
2,pillows,"I ordered these for my daughter on therecommendation of several other people.However I found the preview to be misleading...I was looking for King sizepillows. In any event, they weren't thegreatest and my daughter sent them backright away because she needed King sizepillows."
3,RUNS TEENY TINY!,My husband is a big Tarheels fan. I bought many T-shirts for him and myself. I really liked this one. It is very feminine. I bought a size XL which usually runs a little big for me. This shirt is so tight I can not wear it. I have two thin daughters and hope one of them can wear this. My husband thinks it is sized for a girl and not a woman. It is very pretty if you are a thin woman.
5,FUNNY EARLY BOB HOPE MOVIE!!,THIS IS A FUNNY EARLY BOB HOPE MOVIE WHERE HE PLAYS RIVAL FOR THE MAYORS DAUGHTER.IT'S WELL WORTH WATCHING IF YOU CAN FIND IT!
1,Stopped working....,"I bought this DVD player for my husband and son for the car. I watched one DVD. My brother watched two DVDs during a car trip that we took to meet family. When he tried to load another DVD half way through the trip, it wouldn't load any more. We tried several different DVDs, even called the manufacturer for help. The manufacturer suggested that we try cleaning it, trying an audio CD, etc. None of these suggestions worked.I will be returning this DVD, and purchasing another brand."
4,Works fine,"I've had this DVD player now for 6 months. Based on the recommendation of two family members, who also purchased this product, I bought this player and have had no problems with it. Nor has my family."
1,Won't buy Mintek again,My children got this dvd player as a gift from their grandparents. It played one dvd and then the battery wouldn't ever charge again and the unit would not operate from the AC wall adapter. It's a piece of garbage. We tried contacting the manufacturer and got no response. Hopefully Grandma still has her Costco receipt and it can be returned.
4,Sum 41's underclass,"Sampling everyone from Green Day, Simple Plan to Rise Against and Blink 182, this is a diverse tribute set from the band. Not sure if the songs are tongue-in-cheek or just heavily influenced. While energetic, can't touch the Does this look infected disc. That disc was truly original and closer to their roots than this. Enjoyable till their next outing."
5,A concise guide to birds found east of the Rocky Mountains,"This book allows the novice bird watcher to identify thecommon species of birds that inhabit the U.S. east of the RockyMountains. An easy-to-follow classification system allows the reader to quickly identify a bird before it flies away. All birds are represented in full color with male, female and juvenile colorings represented. A short description of the bird is available that also lists common traits and vocalizations. In addition, maps show summer and winter ranges for each bird species. The introductory chapter contains interesting and useful information on what to feed birds, the types of feeders that are available and offers guidelines for placing nest boxes and platforms in your yard to attract different bird species."
3,Ok movie,"I saw better movies than this one. It is worth watching it, only if you are completely home sick, like I was. Don't spend your money."
2,a better choice,"This is a live album and as with most live albums the production quality is very poor compared to a studio album. My first Baron Rojo album was Volumen Brutal, which is excellent and much heavier and faster than Siempre Estais Alli. I am awaiting my copy of Metalmorphosis from Amozon before I decide to purchase other Baron Rojo CDs. Basically I don't recommend this CD unless you are a hardcore Baron Rojo fan and like live albums with poor production. For those considering buying their first Baron Rojo CD I would highly recommend Volumen Brutal."
4,Pleeeeeeeese support Tony Terry and buy this WONDERFUL album! ....You won't regret it!,"I have loooooved the voice of this man since the mid-80's when he first hit the music scene and blew us ALL away! Tony if you see this posting .....please keep doing what you're doing ...please don't let anyone or anything stop you from the blessing that GOD has for you! Customers on Amazon.com ...do buy this one ...it is an uplifting and inspirational album that is full of traditional numbers as well as some new school tunes!I must say, Tony did a BEAUTIFUL job on his re-make of the Hawkins Family's oldie-but-goodie --> "" Changed ""!!!Be sure to add this one {album} to your gospel and Tony Terry collection :-)"
5,Loved this game in the past!!!,"Our family had this game a number of years ago, and we all enjoyed it so much. The grown kids literally rubbed the letters off the cubes!!I was excited to find it again on this website."
2,Dice scratched!,"This game is sooo fun! My husband and I enjoy playing it a lot. But one small problem - after playing about 6 or 7 games some of the dice were so scratched you could hardly read the letters anymore. The image is only on the surface of the dice and scratches off. I'd like to order another set, but they would scratch too. Hope they fix this problem!"
4,Quick to use-up but entertaining,"My daughter (7) received this for Christmas. She enjoyed banging away and making a mess with the dust and debris. It took her about an hour to complete the whole chunk of rock and mine her crystals. She still enjoys dumping them out of her little sack and looking at them, but it wasn't much of a long-term gift. All-in-all probably not worth the cost, so if it weren't specifically requested for Christmas we wouldn't have purchased this. I guess I will try to ""re-bury"" them in some plaster of paris for a do-over."
4,"messy, educational and fun!","My 4 1/2 year old son and I had fun playing scientist, first digging the crystals out, then using the magnifying glass to see them up close and then learning about them.He was a plaster mess afterwards as were the surrounding areas. But he loved every min. of it and the clean up wasn't bad.All of the crystals were in a clump in one corner and the agate, dolomite and clear quartz weren't there. We ended up with 7 amethyst and 1 rose quartz.Overall fun and educational for both of us and he loved the mess!"
4,Great starter for learning guitar,I got this for my 13 year old daughter to learn to play guitar from and she loves it! Very user friendly and simple.
3,Good...but not a huge departure from the original,"I found this album pleasant to listen to. The problem was that Tori allready uses a lot of classical themes in her music so while classical ""interpretations"" of hard rock type bands are interesting because they differ so much from the original, the result is a somewhat watered down version of her songs, slightly interesting but lacking much of the passion and original musical styling that make the originals so great. This would be good for serious Tori fans who want to hear a slightly different interpretation of some of her best songs. But listen to the originals first because they are in every way much better."
5,Un Brutal Bar√≥n,"Uno de los discos perfectos en nuestro idioma, cargado de energ√≠a en cada uno de sus temas.Este es un regalo de estos genios del hard rock, con sus temas remasterizados y con los temas en idioma ingl√©s que editaron para el mercado ingl√©s.Obligatorio contar con √©l si te gusta el buen hard rock"
4,Solid game. Worth buying.,"EA Sports, once again, has put together a very solid game.What I enjoy the most about NHL 2006 is the Dynasty Mode option, which give you the opportunity to manage one of several NHL and European franchises (or create your own!). This is a great feature, because you get to test your off-the-ice management abilities.Another notable feature is the Create a Player/Create a Team option, which allows you to introduce your own players and teams into the game.The gameplay is smooth and offers a challenge to even the most experienced players. The graphics are also very good and the audio commentary is impressive.There are many other features associated with the game, but I won't comment on them because I don't want to spoil the entire experience for those who are reading this and haven't played the game yet. But I'll conclude by reiterating that it's a solid game and very entertaining for those who enjoy sports (and especially hockey) games."
5,Good Lock,Good Lock. Got The Blue One. Key locks are better than combo locks. i can just pull down on combo locks hard enough to unlock them. STICK WITH KEYS!!!
4,Mysterious,"This is a great mystery book, that takes place in a haunted house. I would especially recommend it for girls, since the main characters are two girls named Nina & Chris.One of them works in an antiquery and is asked to go to Miss Watson's house to pick up an antique wardrobe... being best friends they go together, and when they arrive at the house they realise that there was a lot more than they had expected... in a tower room, they find a big brass bed with a sad little ghost girl...When they start investigating, they find that she is not the only ghost in the house, and that the rest are not at all as nice as she is, and not very happy to see them...."
4,A Great Book,"RecommendationI recommend this book to anyone who is in 6th grade and up because if they were any younger, they could get scared. I enjoyed reading this book because it was a really good mystery. In one scene the windows in the parlor are banging back and forth without anyone touching them. "" STOP!"" yelled Phoebe. This book was also a bit scary. ""The ghost was hitting me, but I didn't feel anything."" In conclusion, if you are interested in reading any scary books, then I recommend you to read this book."
2,Baby Bath Tub,"This had a good seat for a really small one but it also had drawbacks like it was easier to collapse when water was on it so I always kept an extra vigilant eye on everything at bath times w/ one had always on the bed to ensure that the water did not cause it to sink. So it had a great soft area for baby but really this was only good thing about this tub, it also was very heavy when filled wth water since I had to wash baby in a tub and you had to ensure it was always hung up or it would mildew, honestly to me not worth it's cost...."
2,not happy,"This was great until I put it in the washer , it had large white spots and looks like it going to fall apart.it was a gift for my daughter who just had her baby jan 23rd 2009 so she we just started to use it.very unhappy."
4,The 'At a Glance Charts' make this my most commonly used PC book,"The front and back covers (at least of the hard bound version) provide handy and helpful 'At a Glance' charts for beans, rice and grains. These charts are inserted within the content of the book as well.Pages 74-75 provide the 'At a Glance' Vegetable charts, which (since this is ""Vegetarian"" PC book) I would have expected to have been presented with equal prominence and accessibility as the other charts."
3,Good book if you don't care about nutrients,"The recipes might be good, but when you cook vegetables in such high temperature you're just killing them. You might as well be eating canned soup or other forms of ""dead food."" To be healthy, you've got to eat food that still has its nutritional value intact. So what should you do instead? Steam your vegetables. Or eat them raw."
5,Lots of learning and fun,"For my first time using a pressure cooker, I needed some help. This is a great book with alot of recipes that I will cook repeatedly."
1,Be careful,"Although several of the reviews for this product have been good, the player I bought only lasted about two weeks. Whenever I put a disc in, it skips constantly. I tested the discs on other players and had no problems, so I am assuming it must be the player. I didn't drop it or anything, so it seems like it is just cheaply made. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
3,mintek dvd players,This a is a cheap region 1 dvd player which I bought in the US. Although the power supply says AC 110v input I've used it in the UK and Southern Ireland where the voltage is 240 and 230 respectively. I have checked on the web for a region hack code which many people say doesn't work. I even phoned Mintek from the UK and they sent me an email with how to do it but still didn't work. Despite all that most of my dvd's are good internet downloads so it doesn't matter too much. Good value for money but low battery life and skips when it gets hot. Recommended if you use region 0 or 1 but not for other regions.
1,Re:Electronic tribute to ABBA,"This tribute is a total insult. The 2 previous reviews are obviosuly from the artists of this CD or the record label, since anyone who likes ABBA songs would be mortified by these versions.If you want to hear some real cover songs from ABBA, check out Erasure's ABBA tribute album, or the ""Lay All Your Love On ABBA"""
4,More practical to own now than when it was released....,"When this first came out, it must have seemed disappointing. Aside from being a 'Best of' for a PPV that had only had 5 events up to then, it largely ignores both '95 and '96.However, with the death of WCW and the subsequent rise in value of their PPV tapes, this VHS is now a pretty good investment. Aside from covering the main event of '97 (now going for $75 on this site), it goes into detail on every worthwhile match from both '98 and '99 (which would run you about $40-$50 altogether)If you're not a WCW fan who needs every single match, these 'Best of' tapes are real moneysavers. I recommend this one."
4,dragon strike,This book has been updated since I first enjoyed it in 1999. It is as relevant today as it was then.A great book to read if you are interested in SE Asian politics.
3,"Good research, poor editing!","Excellent research and a gripping subject, but marred by HORRIBLE copy-editing - missing words, very poor sentence construction, etc. The production flaws really bothered me a lot in the early part of the book. An important story, though."
1,High hopes,"I was excited when I first saw this product, but my excitement soon turned into disappointment. It looks well built, but my first one lasted about 10 minutes. When I tried to get a replacement, I was told that it was considered a consumable. I then made the mistake of buying another one thinking that the other one breaking was a fluke. Unfortunately, the second one lasted only about 15 minutes. Save your money!"
5,Worth the price,Better than those 30$ ones that milwaukee sells. Also trying to get the minimum letters there got it it it
4,R12 Multicart,"I have owned the R12 cart for three years or so, and it has proven to be valuable tool; except for tire problems it has performed well on a variety of surfaces. I would recommend the large tires for versatility. The new models advertise foam filled tires for reliability, but don't know if they roll over rough surfaces as well as the pneumatic tires do. Conversion to foam filled tires,with shipping, seems to be around half the cost of the cart, so haven't done it. An aluminum version would be high on any frequent user's wish list.tonysmac"
4,Unlike nearly any Sci-fi novel I have ever read.,"But that is true of nearly all of WJW's work. There is sophisticated character developement, and some interesting plot twists. This book deals with racism and segragation in a fictional society, as viewed through the eyes of an outsider.You are kept guessing through the whole book what the mysterious purpose of the outsider is, and whether the two groups of people are even truely Human. A good read."
5,"Tired of the same old songs, Here's a refreshing change","I bought the CD after hearing it at a bar one night, I was singing the words later after only hearing the song once. I had to see if the entire album was as memorable. IT WAS FANTASTIC! I not only bought their ""Live"" CD I purchased their ""Rope the Wildest Heart"" CD and their First cassette release. Their sound is amazing. If you like old style country you'll love this CD. They have a fiddle player that is out-of-this-world! One of the best I've heard since Charlie Daniels. Their sound is like nothing you can hear on the radio and is a refreshing change from today's country/pop music."
4,A compliation of compilations.,"Concord Jazz has some great artists - many are showcased here. This is a re-packaging of three compilations from their Jazz Moods series - Cocktail Party, Groovin' the Blues and Cha Cha Party. The first CD is instrumental, the second has several vocal tracks and the third has limited vocals used primarily as accents. (Tito Puente's Oye Como Va's the most verbose.) Great listening across all three disks.What keeps me from giving this package five stars is the poor liner notes. The artists are listed on the back cover of the package, but the track listings on the inside list only the times and the songwriter credits. Sidemen? I guess Concord figures you don't care about the sidemen; you're supposed to by partying with this collection."
5,"Great reference book on GPRS, a must for your Tel.library","This book has a well structured flow and brings you up to speed quickly on GPRS. Easy to read, yet very informative.This book would also make a great textbook, it helped me to come up to speed quickly. Great explanation of layers and interfaces. To the point, with plenty of supporting illustrations."
3,Great book...BUT...,"Great book...but, if you've read the ""80/20 Indiviudal"", in my opinion, there's not much you'll get out of the ""Living the 80/20/ Way"".""Living the 80/20 Way"" teaches you how to apply the 80/20 principle to your personal life; I suppose if you need this outlined for you then the money for the book is worth it, but I received the same information from the ""80/20 Individual""."
1,I wish it were good. It isn't.,"I've had a fondness for Steve White's books ever since I came across _White Wing_. I don't seek them out, but if I happen to run across them, I read them. Unfortunately, _Prince of the Sunset_ was one of the worst books I've actually finished in a long time. The prose was clunky, the finish a let down. This book is the first of a series, apparently. It would be nice if it were so identified.Most people should give this a pass. Rabid Steve White fans might want to peruse it, but I think even they will be disappointed."
2,Clunky and unmemorable,"The SF novel by Steve White is clunky and unmemorable.I feel it is most noted for the opening paragraph of the second chapter being a real-life example of a Bulwer-Lytton nominee. The Bulwer-Lytton contest is normally entered by contestants trying to write the worst opening paragraph of a novel. This seems like an outline for three or more books than this single edition. The writing isn't that good, rough draft quality, but the plot is OK.Amazon - Many of the reviews here are for a non-fiction book on Hollywood, not this novel. (That has been corrected in the intervening years since I wrote this review.)"
4,What a Deal,"I kept expecting some of the peculiarities described below, but aside from noticing that the tray takes a few seconds to eject, nothing in my experience so far has altered my satisfaction with this purchase. I don't think I'm as technically savvy as some folks so I can't speak to their concerns. For my purposes (playing DVDs on a regular TV with no bells and whistles) this little machine works just fine. The image quality is better than my videos and far surpasses the picture I get on my broadcast channels. Best of all, it was $39.99-plus shipping. I'm happy."
3,Where is my Rebate?,ALl I have to say while I like the player is Where is my rebate? I sent in the rebate 2 months ago and I have not heard back!
1,"This is Junk, amazon shouldnt sell it","We had 2 sent to us, both failed out of the box. Its a heap. decided to spend an extra $10, and use the free slower shipping. Amazon should do themselves a favour and save money on the returns costs, stop stocking this imho. Its rubbish."
2,Be wary of this cheap DVD player.,"This DVD player plays all standard movies fine, but it cannot play double-density DVDs. For example, I couldnt get it to even read Any of my Star Trek or 24 television show DVDs, also long movies like Gladiator and Fight Club were not recognized. When I pop in a short 90 minute movie like Road Trip or The Way of The Gun it reads it fine."
1,Dead unit - Pruchased 7-2003 died RIP 10-2004,"This unit was OK but not spectacular. It often did not read a disk IE: You had to re-insert them at times. When it worked it worked well though.Bottom line: After a year and three months this unit has quit working. It will not read any disk that is inserted. It cannot be used as a paperweight because it is too light LOL. I paid a low price and got what I paid for I guess.If I were purchasing another DVD player or any other electronic item I'd shy away from Norcent - or is that AVorcent (Notice the ""N"" in Norcent's products is composed of the letter ""A""and then the letter ""v"" to look like an ""N""That was the coolest thing about this unit. Now I'm going to put my old Toshiba DVD back into service."
4,Informative and Illuminating,"The book provided a range of scholarly argument about a very complex subject which allowed the reader to find or develop a personal position based on his/her interpretation of the Scriptures. It blended practical, although sometimes outlandish, illustrations in real life to more clearly relate some abstract philosophical and theological concepts. Overall, it was a very interesting read and one that I would highly recommend."
1,Lousy and unbelievable,"A lousy book. The old saw is true, you can spot a good or bad book within the first few pages.I read this on the plane to somewhere and wish I hadn't brought it w/ me.The characters are unrealistic; the plot is silly. The idea that very disparate groups are going to somehow cometogether to launch a right wing coup in the USA is absurd. We aren't talking terrorism or crime but an actual coup a labanana republic.The token Latino lady newscaster is twit. The news reporter is barely capable and of course the Mossad agent just happens to pop out of nowhere to save us all. The obligatory right wing military man steps out of a comic book does a prat fall. no thanks."
3,Nice idea,"I LOVE the idea of this (and how it looks).I wish the part of the ""staple"" that loops through was longer.I use it for basic papers around the house, but wouldn't use it for more substantial needs."
4,A very good beginning instruction guide,"I've bought a bunch of 'get started drumming' books, but I stopped after I got this one because it's just what I was looking for. It teaches you how to read drum music, then introduces you to hundreds and hundreds of beats.Each chapter teaches you a variety of beats and also introduces several new songs for you to play along with. The chapters get progressively more complicated, but the authors explain the role of the drummer in these more complex songs.If you master the instruction in this book, you can probably start playing with a band with a good measure of confidence.Jim"

1,Sad reflections of an aging wrestler,"There really isn't much good to be said about this video, except that it is some of the best production values that WCW has ever put out. Of course, most of the video is spent with Hogan's ""reflections"" on the NWO, his greatest matches and the riches he has received on the back of the entire industry. What this video does indicate, is that Hogan is the arrogant, pompas, aging a$$ that he seems to be on TV. Please, buy the Ric Flair video if you want a legend and the Goldberg video if you want to see a superstar. Get this video if you want to see a washed up never was."
4,Challenging and Thought Provoking,"This book is written to increase ones faith and boldness in prayer. Some of his approaches to prayer are challenging both in technique and from a theological perspective. I cannot say that I agree with all he says, but he does have success on his side. Furthermore, he causes one to stretch their own view of what is possible. And, this is a good thing!"
5,I wondered how Cho could have so much success....,"Having heard of Cho's success, with a church of more than 800,000 Christians, I wondered how he did it. What was his gimmick? Clever doctrine? A Feel-Good message? I was prepared not to like him much. After reading of his heart for the lost, his love for Christ, his unabashed humility, his humor, I could see he was very unlike me...in all the ways that matter most to God. Cho is a man of prayer and devotion to the Lord. His life of sacrifice, obedience, and trust in the Lord reveal the secret to his success: Jesus Christ.I am grateful for both the minister and his message... This is a book that will draw you closer to the heavenly realm."
1,Disappointing,"We were rather disappointed by this game. The description on the box made it sound similar to some of our favorite card/strategy games. However, once we opened the box, the directions were very confusing, and it is not that fun to play."
1,very confusing,"The directions are so confusing, and conflicting, so who knows if the game is fun or not??? You can't follow the directions, because they make no sense!"
5,Great Piece of work,"This is by far my favorite BHT albumn, and I do have them all. This albumn has my favorite rendition of my favorite song, Bittersweet, on it (and if a more perfectly constructed song has ever been produced I have yet to hear it. They combine soulful ballads along with some driving rock and that is what makes this a great albumn."
5,A True Work of Art,"This album captures BHTM at their best. It contains a version of ""Bittersweet"" that is superior to the more heavily produced version on ""Sister Sweetly"". Also, ""Love Betsy"", ""Vincent"", and ""The Moose Song"" are incredible. How is it possible that these guys are not more well known?"
5,My favorite CD from Big Head Todd and the Monsters,"Well balanced CD. Full of great songs: slow, happy, powerful, party-funky, bluesy. Great guitar sound, acoustics, lyrics. For every body who does not know them yet I would describe them as Bob Dylan of the nineties. Powerful folk from the midwest."
2,Big Head Todd is everything you thought it should be.,A rather two-dimensional naive version of rock and roll. Todd got only one listen from me. He's up for sale now. Not for the adventurerous.
4,God bless us all !,"When Charles Dickens put his pen to paper and wrote this timeless Christmas Story he likely never imagined that his simple story of a wrong turned right would be told so many times and in so many ways. Mr. Dickens would enjoy this telling of his story. Although, incomplete as almost all movie versions of this tale are, it effectively communicates the message of Christmas: a lost soul redeemed and that is what Mr. Dickens intended!Enjoy this show and be prepared to find your Christmas Cheer as you watch that mean old Scrooge transform into a benevolent old gentlemen full of goodwill for his fellow man."
1,"Please, get the 1951 version instead.","Do yourself and family a favor and avoid this drivel. I do not understand the positive reviews for what is nothing but treacle. I do like Reginald Owen in other films, but his performance here is ridiculous. This is the weakest of the many, many versions. The 1951 film Scrooge (released as A Christmas Carol in the US) featuring Alastair Sim is by far the best."
1,I love the story but hate this DVD,I do not believe this is caused by the seller but the sound cuts in & out thru the whole DVD. The picture is perfect but the soundtrack is either so faint or just not there. I've purchased other DVDs from multiple sellers & have run into this same problem. The manufacturers need to verify the audio before they release a DVD for sale. Also why do I have to turn the volume up on my TV to 100/max to hear some DVDs as I had to do with this one????
5,Christmas Carol,"The Alastair Sim version of Christmas Carol isthe most perfect of the all the movie versions.In black and white, brooding, with sparse sets and little musicit shows, in grim detail, the ghost story that Dickens conveyed of a cold, bleak England.The souls throwing money to trying to repent from whatthey did not do in life, made me cry.Jacob Marley hoping to help Scroogeunderstand the cruelty of his ways and not suffering the samefate! (Note: see a very young Patrick MacNee as the young Marley)The ghosts are not gentle inshowing Scrooge the errors of his ways.The ghost of Christmas present telling Scrooge that 'want(the girl) and ignorance(the boy) cling to him at this time of year...""Beware of bothbut most of all beware the boy!""Most insightful and true to this very day.The changes in Scrooge after his ghostly visits are not phoney.He is elated, sorrowful, and humbled by his experience. A wonderful movie to be shown anytime of the year.It's just a very special movie."
4,A Christmas Carol,"It took me awhile to warm up to this version of Scooge. I had always been partial to Alastair Sim whom I thought played the part to a T as a person who becomes transformed. Once I began to really sit down and take notice of Reginald Owen and the way certain things were different from the Alastair Sim version, I became intrigged of the real humor as the movie progressed. To this day I guess you can say I am a great defender of both movies and now think of them as equal. If anyone were to see A Christmas Carol staring Reginald Owen for the first time I'm sure they would take a likin' to it.As a review of both movies, and I have seen many remakes of A Christmas Carol......these two will long be the best and give it my thumbs up.Jim Lawson"
4,tricky but worth it,"I read a LOT of reviews for tips, and that helped. I will definitely buy black for my lashes and seriously keep the remover solution near by, you'll need it - but everything turned out great!"
1,did not care for it.,didn't work for meonly used it onces but will try it again to see if I have better luck
1,Listen to us!,"I decided to ignore the other reviewers. Bad idea. This product is expensive garbage. It's messy and complicated and more importantly, it really doesn't work. Using identical process, I wound up with one eye dyed and one eye much less dyed, I looked like Petey the dog. The only good news is that it all wore off within a few days. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Well the ending robbed me!!!,"This is decent, not great, not good, but decent enough to watch. The mecha, not the bada$$ one, reminded me a lot of Gundam and Robotech/Marcoss mecha. The Idolo mecha reminded me a whole lot of Evangelion. But overall they weren't too blatant.The voice acting was pretty good. The dialouge at spots was a bit odd, but you can never nail dialouge perfectly. The story was beautifully drawn and written, yet I felt the backstory wasn't very well set up."
2,"Good Quality and Design, but switch stopped working","Bought this item based on the reviews and when it came in I was very satisfied with the quality of the touch switch itself and the dimming unit. Better than the model I was replacing! But after setting it up and running all my cables to it, the switch contacts faulted into the on position (maybe 6 days later). We only use the touch switch maybe a half dozen times a day at most, and we became unable to turn the unit off without unplugging it from the wall. Tested all the connections on the wiring I did and found no problems and tested the unit to find the switch input was frozen in the on position. Returned the unit for a different model from another company.Faulty unit perhaps."
1,an enchanted evening,"I have to agree with other previewers likewise this DVD is far from acceptable,the picture quality is abysmal to say the least,and does indeed look as if its been dubbed from a VHS tape,with all the inferior problems such as flickering of vivid colors,grainy pictures and even a sure giveaway dropouts,ie black horizontal lines across picture every so often.This is shameful of pioneer,and does no justice to this fabulous musician that kitaro is,likewise the same can be said of his violinist Lorenza Ponce in this concert it dont do her no justice either.Im afraid i can safely say give this disc a miss,simply because of the picture quality."
3,everything is not as it seems,i purchased this movie in 06 and just watched it recently.good but not great as far as i was concerned.young girl goes to live with her sister who doesn't want anything to do with her.as it turns out she finds people who do care.all things work out well in the end as usual.
4,A pounder's pounder,"Dave Weckl on his break thru intro cd proves that he's one of the best pounders out there today , the best tracks on it stand out and above the rest, with Morning Sunrise, Auratune ,festival del Ritmo, & anyone who appreciates drum mastery will no doubt be taken by the left-channel / right-channel drum jam between Weckl & Steve Gadd on the best track on the cd Master Plan , you can't come away after listening to this song without at least an appreciation of what great drummers truly sound like."
4,Weckl kicks!,I like track 2 the most. Overall good cd and great drumming. Heads Up is still my favorite Weckl cd.
1,Worthless,This manual has little that applies to any Caddy and what may be in there is hard to locate. I found more on the internet than in this manual!
2,"Great game, but really no need for a strategy guide...","Halo is a *great* game, with stunning graphics, immersive gameplay, and a great storyline to back it all up. Although the game is not completely ""scripted"", the objectives are clear enough that there should be no need for a strategy guide for the average joe gamer.As said before, this guide serves not much more of a purpose other than a more complete manual. If you need help/are stumped with the game, there are many resources online, be sure to consider it's value."
1,strategy guides are for losers,"Strategy guides are horrible. They ruin the entire game and lower the replay value a lot. ESPECIALLY with HALO! IF UR REALLY STUCK, BEAT IT IN CO-OP WITH A FRIEND, THEN BEAT IT URSELF!!! I beat the game with no help on the impossible ones like Two Betrayals, so why cant you??? Plus you can just get them online free from the internet."
5,Searching For Jacob,"Great episode, shows the situation and plight of refugees and victims of genocide. Great educational tool."
5,Blue Corn Chips Taste Really Good,These corn chips are crispy and taste great. And very few broken chips in the bag (I like my chips whole). I just wish they weren't blue. Why would they go to the trouble of dying them blue?
5,Best Corn Flavor,"These Organic Blue Corn Chips are the best. They are very low in salt also, which is what prompted me to give them a try. I am now ordering my second case of 12, since I have eaten my way through the first 12 bags.I am extremely impressed with the CORN flavor of these chips - so pure and natural. My kids love them too, either plain or with salsa or other dips. They are a little thicker and more crunchy that white corn tortillas, but I tend to enjoy them like that."
5,Were NOT stale!! had 4 months till expiration date..,"I dont see how these can be stale from other reviews, unless they were expired. These chips arrived packaged in thicker then normal chip bags to keep freshness. (maybe they recently changed packaging method? bag different then pictured. Has non GMO/gluten free on the front) Anyways. they taste perfect for dipping chips, and are not overwelmed with salt like other brands in stores. priced right too. Overall I'm pleased!"
5,Watch Out Whole Foods,"The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there. Really though, did you see the price? Like $1.12 a bag. Whole foods may finnally have someone to hold them accountable destroying health food stores. Thanks Amazon, for carring the brands whole foods wont bother with any more and for having prices that you can feed families with."
3,not correc size,"This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces. Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods. The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark. To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right."
2,Nothing but crumbs!!,"Do not order these online. They are shipped in the flimsy box that the grocery stores use. No additional packaging is used to protect the inside. My box was crushed on three corners, adding to the already crushed chips. I wound up feeding them to the birds."
4,"Great chips, but...","I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!"
1,Worst corn chip ever -- unless you like stucco,I'm astonished that this may reviewers think this product is edible let alone good! I have never had such a pathetic excuse for a corn chip. All I'll say is it's amazing what people will eat!
1,don't bother,My chips arrived completely pulverized. They were shipped with no extra packing. Bummer
3,like stale popcorn,"These 1.5"" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them. considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip. Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper. Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale."
4,Angelique & Adonis!!!,"This book put me back on the right track. After reading about Marcus & Vera, I was a little disappointed. Angel & Donnie's story was a lot better. At times, I felt like there were way too many people in this story to keep up with. I only wish, that Melanie would have focused more on Angel and Donnie. I really wasn't too interested about Lisette and Warren since I've never really known them from the other books. But other than that, I thought this was a very good read. I'm pretty sure Angel has a lot of haters from the way she carried herself in the previous books, but she has always been one of my favorites. She is even more lovable in this book after you understand her story and why she behaved the way she did in the past. Very good book. On to the next."
3,"Great idea, piece of junk!","Though I read all the reviews which warned this toy is not durable, it sounded like so much fun thatI bought it for my daughter for Christmas anyway. It took awhile to put together and then the on/off switch didn't work. It just spun around loosely. Crayola needs to improve on this great idea and make it workable. There are too many reviews which rate it poorly. Buyer beware!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The concept is great, but the thing absolutely ..... The bulb blows out and as someone else said, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you can't put a 4.5 volt light with 6 volt battery and not have it burn out on you. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I bought it for my niece as a Christmas gift, and I'm angry and disappointed that I'm out almost as much on shipping charges (both ways) as is the cost of the product."
1,Don't buy this,I DO NOT recommend this product. The bulbs have blown out each time my kids have played with them. Replacement bulbs are difficult to find. The company sent me 2 bulbs which also blew out. The toy requires 6 volts of battery power and the bulb is designed to take 4.5 volts. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the bulbs will continue to keep blowing. I have been unable to find a screw base bulb to accomodate 6 volts. (Three hardware stores and a lighting store so far.) It doesn't focus very well either. I have 2 of these on a shelf collecting dust.
3,Disappointed,"My son received this for his 5th birthday. Upon opening the package, you come to realize that it doesn't come with a single marker or eraser. For the [$$$] charged for this item, I feel it certainly should. Therefore, my son was really upset that he couldn't use his new gift,until I was able to get out to the store and spend additional money on markers. The instructions don't even tell you which type of markers to use. Is it the washable ones, the dry erase ones? what?Secondly, the bulb burned out after about 10 seconds. I sent an e-mail to the manufacturer, telling them of our extreme disappointment in this product. Their response was: ""we'll send you a couple of replacement bulbs"". BIG DEAL. I used to associated the name Crayola with quality, but my view has certainly changed now.This product is a good idea, but it needs ALOT of work. Basically, it's a [$$$] piece of plastic."
3,Don't waste your money,"My son got this toy for his birthday. It's a great concept, but this toy is just junk. You can't move the projected image because the top portion where the light bulb is isn't ""hinged"" correctly. It just kind of flops downward, so only half of the picture is on the whiteboard. Seems simple enough for Crayola to fix, but they haven't. Don't they test the products out first? I didn't have a problem with the bulb, but that could be because we only used it maybe 2 times. This toy is now at a nearby dump."
1,A Waste of Money!,"The images are so lightly displayed that you really can not trace them. The paper holder does not hold the paper tight. The overall quality is very poor. Don't waste your money on this one, you'd be better off buying tracing paper."
4,Crayola Trace & Draw,"I believe the trace and draw is over priced. My kids like it,but it could be a little more durable."
3,Question?,Does anyone know how to get replacement bulbs for this thing.Within days both of the bulbs were broken. My six year old daughter loves to play with it but we haven't been able to find new bulbs to make it work. Can anyone help??
2,HELP.......WHERE TO GET LIGHT BULBS,I know this thing is a piece of crap but my 5 year old is unhappy because it fell of her Little Tikes table and now it doesn't seem to work. I think it may be the light bulb. Is there anyone out there that knows what kind of buld to use. Your help would be grealty appreciated.
1,Big Dissapointment,"I have read the other reviews, and cannot believe that it got any positive reviews! My 3 year old just received this for Christmas and was anxious to try it out. Our light bulb works, but we would have to have her play with it in a closet in order for her to see the image! During daylight the image is barely noticable. Even if you do go into a dark room the image only lit up for a few seconds, and then slowly faded to a black screen. My daughter loves drawing and can't understand why her new toy is already ""broken"". I recommend reading the reviews for the Travel Trace N Draw, which is more on target with how this similar product works. This is not the quality I expected from Crayola. Don't waste your time or money- at $19.99 it ought to do something!"
4,Soulful notes,"This is my romance album!Kenny has a way to sax you into sex, you just can't help thanking him both for the music and the emotions.This Cd is a greatest hits compilation which was released over here in europe in the early '90's...so it misses out on lots of new material, but it includes some great tunes such as SONGBIRD (Kenny's very first Top 10 hit..and my favourite to set the mood to candlelight and kisses), TRADWINDS, the sensual LET GO and the real nugget: DON'T MAKE ME WAIT FOR LOVE in duet with Michael Bolton.I just someday hope Michael will include this on a box set package if he ever releases one..it is beautiful!And if you need fresh air, two unreleased tracks: GOING HOME and UNCLE AL.Worth buying, especially if you are a hopeless romantic!"
4,Nice,Item was as advertised. Putting it together was a little bit of a hassle as the instructions were not real clear. Very comfortable. Overall I would recommend.
2,Though it was okay until I used it.,It was very easy to put together but the arm cushions don't fit. They slide around and are constantly uncomfprtable. The chair started squeeking a few weeks after we bought it too. The bottom and back cushions lost their shape quickly too. I am unhappy with this glidder.
2,A Tough Read,"My god...this is tough to get through. I think they read differently when Gibbon wrote this. It's extremely dense and wordy. If you're REALLY interested in the subject and Gibbon's point of view, you may want to get this. But be prepared for a slog. I confess that I can't handle it."
3,Too bad...,"I've had the opportunity to see Steve a while back while they were still a small band playing local gigs in Britain. I was amazed at their ability to make solid, hook filled alt/rock songs. Nothing really groundbreaking, but wonderfully done. I bought their demo EP, and have played it to death. Unfortunately, they got signed. It seems that with this full length album they got carried away with all the ""nifty things"" they could do in the studio, and the great music got lost beneath a pile of blips and beeps. It's still there, of course, but you REALLY have to look for it. I like Steve a lot, and I hope maybe next time they can get it right."
1,"nope , just not right","This didnt do it for me. Trite lyrics, banal music. Just an overall bore of an album. I want my money back , honestly. Learn to play your instruments steve! The musicanship is absolutely horrendous. Gets my lowest possible score, avoid this at all costs."
3,Pink Hotel Review,"I wish this release were on CD rather than just cassette. It's a rather random collection, but well worth getting if you're a Firesign fan.Pink Hotel isn't a cohesive release (it wasn't intended as an ""album""), but it's got some great material, including pieces that shed further light on material that's been released on their actual albums."
5,Handy and decorative,I bought this for my mom's home office and she really likes that the outlets are color-coded and that cables can be labeled with the included colored tags.
2,BUY ABBA-ESQUE INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!,THE EP ABBA-ESQUE IS WONDERFUL BUT THEY REALLY BLEW IT ON THE REMIXES. VOLUEZ VOUS-TOO HARD. MAKES YOUR HEAD HURT LISTENING TO IT. SOS-INCREDIBLY BORING AND HARD TO DANCE TO. TAKE A CHANCE ON ME- 13 1/2 MINUTES OF PURE NOTHING. LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME- THIS IS THE ONE MIX THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HOT IF THEY HAD JUST INCLUDED SOME VOCALS.DISAPPOINTING!!!
2,It sorta works,"I did a disc brake conversion on my ""muscle car"" and thought this would ease the bleeding process somewhat. If there are any leaks in the system you'll be there for weeks doing your bleeding. With all new plumbing and fittings, leaks are inevitable. This will just draw more air into the system and you find the bleeding (and pumping) goes on forever. With the two man operation leaks show up and you're able to tighten/fix the problem areas. It will draw a vacuum as advertised but the included cup is rather small and becomes messy as you empty it. All-in-all the old conventional pump and hold system works better."
3,Ok for small jobs,Been using this for a few years now as a siphon device for the power steering fluid and brake fluid reservoirs. Wish it had a bigger canister though.
4,Direct flight from Senegal to Egypt,"Youssou N'Dour is to Senegal what Fela Kuti was to Nigeria. Moreover, he moves far beyond the borders of Senegal and Africa having embraced World Music and recorded with Paul Simon and others.Egypt features him with a full Egyptian orchestra and as always the result is invigorating, enlightening and enjoyable. While I doubt you will understand the lyrics, the music speaks for itself and the message is rewarding.My only complaint is the 41 minute running time for this CD. I don't believe these were the only tracks recorded. If you want traditional Senegalese music then pass on this album. If you want to experience a hybrid musical experience then buy this album. If you are unsure then buy a low-priced used version. It is worth a $5.00 investment."
5,Great character development,"Every once in a while a book comes along that your have to take the time to recommend to other readers, and this is one of them. The book is set in 1960 in a small southern town, and isn't about social issues, but rather about a trumatic experience in a young girl's life as she is preparing to enter highschool. The above editorial review covers the reasons behind her mother's breakdown, so I wont recap them, but I want to comment on the characters in the story. Buddy - is a rare jewel of a person, who is very open and honest and wise beyond her years. She alternately combines sorrow, confusion and humor without overdoing any and is totally believeable in all aspects. I was captivated by her 22 year old Aunt Sherry, who held the family together in more ways than one. The rest of the family and friends rounded out the story, but Buddy, her mom, and Sherry were what made it one of the best reads I have had in a long time."
5,help,"we are going to evolve a lesson which need to apply for some book.would you tell me some information for the book ,, Fourth Editionby Dickson Despommier, Robert Gwadz, Peter Hotez, Charles Knirsch.and the book <Human Parasitology.by Burton J. Bogitsh, Thomas C. Cheng.the information are front cover,table of contents and preface.please as early as possible.thank you very much."
3,Christmas Gift in 2011,Don't really know about this game. I do not believe that my granddaughter plays with it any more. But she was just excited to open a gift. Thank you.
3,genocyber,this is cool cartoons and its in asian language with english sub titles wish they would put that on the heading instead of making you hunt and read everything you can find to read so you dont miss anyting
1,I didn't like it,"I tired of this book very quickly, it was so boring to read that I didn't even finish it."
3,Decent and fun budget collection - with some rare titles,"NOTE: The movie list above (under Editorial Reviews) is wrong. Here are the films actually included in this set:Disc 1The Bat (1959) - Vincent PriceThe House on Haunted Hill (1959) - William Castle/Vincent PriceBlack Sabbath (1963) - AIP English version! - Mario Bava/Boris KarloffSnake People (1971) - Boris KarloffThe Hideous Sun Demon (1959) - Robert ClarkeThe Blob (1958) - Steve McQueenDisc 2Creature of the Walking Dead (1965) - rare on DVDHaunted Ranch (1943) - Monogram weird westernThe Little Shop of Horrors (1960) - Roger CormanNight of the Living Dead (1968) - George RomeroCorridors of Evil aka Carnival of Souls (1962) - Herk HarveyGodzilla, King of the Monsters! (1958) - Ishir Honda/Raymond BurrPrints and picture quality are what you'd expect for a budget public domain (?) collection: watchable and not much else. Some titles fare better than others, but for this price you really can't go wrong."
3,Buy at your own risk,"I just recieved this set in the mail and reviewed the quality last night and so far three of the movies are not working, they freeze every two seconds. As for the others on there I find that they work ok, so I guess I would say I'm not too disapointed, but it would be nice if brand new dvd's worked."
4,klowe,Skip the oil packet. Add fresh ginger and your favorite stir fry vegetable and this is a great fast meal.
4,coolest european black metal band!!!,"The best worked_melodic band for this times, they blast the american's black metal bands, and other... listen the ACDC cover too, its great!!!"
4,Red Dragon Slipper,"My Mom loved my animal slippers and said she would want Dragons, so when I saw these - they were perfect!"
2,"Great TV, until is breaks....","I bought the RD50 about nine months ago through Amazon. Great price. Shipping worked fine. TV looked great. Then it broke. While under warranty, it took 2-3 weeks for Optoma to get a technician to come and conclude that it couldn't be fixed. Three or four more weeks to get a replacement, which will be a refurbished TV of unknown age. Buyer beware."
2,Fabulous pictures -- Painful text!,"This is not a book for parents interested in Attachment Parenting. Statements such as babies cannot be breast-fed immediately after birth, don't allow the baby in your bed, and the gut-wrenching ""cry-it-out"" philosophy all made me cringe. Beautiful pictures throughout however, showing step-by-step instructions for tasks of daily care (bathing, dressing) as well as excellent first-aid and illness section. However, they show month-by-month pictures of a pregnant woman -- she gains 26 pounds, perfect clear skin, no stretch marks, no cellulite, in short, perfect. Hard to live up to in real life. As a Registered Nurse I would recommend the pictures and health care section, especially for new parents. Very helpful. But don't read the text! The Sears Parenting books are so much better. Trust your instincts!"
5,Macally SN-A411 USB AC Charger for SanDisk Sansa MP3 Players,Does what it claims to do. Good price. Recommend to anyone who wants to charge their Sansa without a computer.
2,Worked for 6 Months,Charger worked fine for about 6 months and then just died. Decided to try a Griffin charger to see if it would last any longer than this one.
3,"a solid, if uneven, effort","this is a good album, but not one of lou's best. ""metal machine music, part 1"" gets things off to a promising start, but ""metal machine music, part 2"" can't sustain the momentum. ""part 3"" and ""part 4"" are decent songs, but nothing really special."
1,Trash is an unbelievable understatement.,"Rollingstone said it all when they voted it the worst album ever made. I remember buying the thing on vinyl,returning it for my money back; and later buying a copy at the pawnshop for fifty cents. I figured everyone else on earth would return it, and it would be a collecters item. It may well be on vinyl,but don't bother on cd;alter your head and listen to the refridgerator motor!"
5,Perfect.,"This book was exactly what I needed and I received it just as soon as I expected that I would, if not sooner."
4,Vintage rock footage,This is a combination of the Casey Kasem's Rock & Roll Goldmine: The British Invasion DVD & the Casey Kasem's Rock & Roll Goldmine: San Francisco Sound DVD. So you get almost 90 minutes. Those two DVD's are reviewed already.
3,"good idea, but","i would check out luc delahaye's 'l'autre' before this for a more ""pure"" portrait technique, but these are fascinating, simple, and as ron burgundy might say, ""compelling and rich.""still, the book has only 40 or so pages, and not a great deal because of it."
5,Football season perfection,"I bought two of these for both my boy's; one plays football, the other runs track for their schools. My boy's have expressed the comfort they feel in these, as well as the ability to keep them warm and dry from sweat in cold conditions. Can't go wrong with Under Armour; we all share a love of sports and are a very athletic and competitive family; Under Armour is always our first choice of gear."
5,Great.,My nephew loved this. It is of great quality and true to size. Ended up ordering several more. Recommend this to anyone.
4,GOOD HEATGEAR TEE,"The shirt is fine, good quality, fresh, comfortable, like the picture. It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve. Wherever, my son loves to wear this tee.(Sorry for my english)"
3,"Essential, but ...","It is the best encyclopedia of philosophy available in English,and as comprehensive as one could reasonably want on theAnglo-American analytic tradition. However, it is still inferiorto the magisterial Historisches Woerterbuch der Philosophie, ed.Joachim Ritter (12 vols., of which 11 have thus far beenpublished) - the one true indispensable philosophical referencework."
4,Sense and Sensibility Review,"I'm collecting as many video dramatizations of Jane Austen's novels as I can lay my hands on. I particularly prefer the ""older"" BBC versions to some of the newer because of the longer run times ... meaning there is more of the book on the screen. And the British are renown for being ""faithful"" to their dramatization of classic literature. Although the actors are certainly older than the characters they are portraying, I still liked this version being familiar with so many of those actors from other Masterpiece Theatre and/or BBC productions I've viewed on PBS over the years.This nearly three-hour version features ""salad days"" performances by Joanna David, Patricia Routledge, Robin Ellis and Clive Frances (adversaries in the POLDARK mini-series) and when you factor in that this 1971 mini-series had never aired in this country made it a ""must"" purchase. I was not disappointed, and would recommend it to other Austen addicts like myself."
2,Abhorrent yet Spellbinding,"Holocaust Revisionism is a dangerous area. It is filled with some people who are very smart and others that are dangerously stupid. This book by Paul Rassinier is considered the touchstone work of revisionism. Rassinier was an inmate of Buchenwald, but lived in great denial. He claims that only around a million Jews were killed in the holocaust and the Jews themselves ran the camps in a Judeo-Communist conspiracy. To be honest this book gave me a headache, page after page made me sick. I do however recommend reading it, it is fascinating study of what lengths the revisionists will go to support their various theses, borrow it if you can find it, buying it, if from Revisionist groups only gives them more money to spread their...well crap."
2,Not what I wanted,"I ordered these dolls for my niece for Christmas. What I got was nothing like I expected. I expected them to be a little bigger, for the money. I expected their clothes to be more like little clothes, instead of rags tied around a doll's neck. I'm just not pleased with what I thought I was getting."
3,I disagree,"First of all, for the people who have stupid complaints about Bratz being slutts listen up. Many dolls have belly button tops or short skirts. If you dont like the clothes then sew and knit your own clothes for the doll. I highly recommend Bratz for basically all ages. I think that these dolls are great because they express there selves. I also think that Bratz are the best dolls compared to Barbie and My Scene so stop writting unnesessary complaints. If you have a proble with the clothes then try to knit your own."
2,grumble grumble,"i love donkey kong games but this one is BAD. why? because, the controls are horrible, it doesnt feel like im playing a game, and its just not that great."
3,GOOD MUSIC THAT IMPROVES WITH LISTENING,I originally called this music derivative. I put it away for a month and a half and when I played it again I was delighted to hear that it is really good. Even original. I never judge a piece until I listen to it again and again. Glad I did this time. It is tonic and romantic. I bought this CD to familiarize myself with Weingartner. Now that I have I will buy more of him. I am happy to recommend this thoughtful meaningful composer.My original review carried 3 stars. I would like to increase this to 4 but Amazon doesn't allow one to change this item in a review. Pity.
3,good but not memorable,"This is a good, well-told story of the first US national women's crew team, how they came together, the different personalities and backgrounds, and their excellent coach. Not overly memorable, but would be recommended especially for young girls involved in sports."
3,Wow,$500???!!! Are you kidding me? This exact same set can be bought from the wal mart web site for $99.
1,Horrible book!,I'd be very surprised if this book wasn't really written by a man. It started out okay but went quickly downhill. The characters are unbelievable. There doesn't seem to be anything that Jordan can't do. And Gillian comes across as spineless. A complete waste of time and money.
4,Barbara Stanwyck at her best,"In Christmas in Connecticut, Barbara Stanwyck shows her splenderous comedic talent in an intelligent screwball romantic comedy. Stanwyck plays Elisabeth Lane, an independent woman and cunning journalist with a soft edge. The comedy succesfully exploits irony and a lighthearted skeptism towards traditional family values, while never surrendering faith in them. Uncle Felix, played by S.Z. Sakall, could as well be Santa Claus come to CT to deliver the most treasured gift of the Holiday: love."
5,An American Classic,"For many years I would wait every Christmas to watch this movie with my mother. This is one of her two favorites(White Christmas is the other) and it quickly became one of mine. It is a movie that shows life as we make it, but in a much simplier time. Before the e-mails, cell phones, and all the other electronic things we take for granted today. It is a feel good movie that makes you sit back, relax, and wish that you were able to put yourself into the movie. You laugh with and at the characters and their situations. It is a movie that carries itself perfectly in black & white. You appreciate the simplier things and are glad that Turner never got his hands on this one. The re-make is a very, very disappointing attempt to bring a wholesome holiday from the past into our times."
5,Holiday Favorite,This movie has been a holiday favorite of ours for years now and the VHS tape has started to wear out so we were very glad to see it on DVD now.
2,No element of surprise,I usually love the old movies and I love most Christmas movies. This one was a bit of a bore. There was no element of surprise. The movie takes place during the Christmas season but there really wasn't anything to do with Christmas.
5,Love it!,One of my all time favorite Christmas movies! Came in plenty of time for all of us to enjoy during the holidays.
4,"Barbara Stanwyck shines in this one and Dennis Morgan is smooth. Fun for the family, a gem not to be missed at Christmastime.","I have enjoyed this movie for many years and gave it as a gift. Another great Christmas movie from old Hollywod.No nudity, bad language, just fun. Barbara Stanwyck is at her best here. Enjoy!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This movie simply didn't live up to its previous reviews. The cast was excellent and all gave terrific performances, but the plot was too thin for the cast to carry. It was very predictable and simply never captured the heart and imagination of the Christmas spirit. We were all disappointed and agreed that it was not worth watching again."
4,Christmas In Connecticut,It was given as a gift.The person has not seen it yet. I have seen this movie in the past and it is worth seeing.
1,This is terrible,"Is it really that hard to make a good dodgeball video game? This kinda uses the ""super dodgeball"" rules and maybe even engine, except it is slow, the characters are ugly, and gameplay is difficult at best. I threw this out after an hour of play."
2,Coleman 8-qt. (personal) cooler,"Dimensions listed for Coleman 8-qt. (personal) cooler were generous and somewhat misleading. Actual outside dimensions must have been measured as follows: depth, from top of lid to bottom of cooler; length, from one outside hinge of handle to the other; width, exaggerated and apparently from outside edge of handle when in horizontal position to opposite side of cooler where it curves slightly outward. Inside dimensions--real usable space--are about 7""d x 8.5""l x 6.5""w. If, as advertised, you can pack 10 soda cans, plan on using a few ice cubes rather than thick blue ice. Only 2 can/cup holders in lid."
4,Coby Boombox,"I had one of these Boomboxes, but I gave it to my newphew before we moved to California. I'm wishing I would have kept it though, because I've never heard such sound come from such a relatively small piece of equipment. I've got a Boze Wave-System radio, and I feel the sound from the Coby Boombox is superior to what I'm getting from the Boze. One of the reasons, is that you can adjust the base reponse with the Coby, whereas with the Boze, that can't be done. If you're a ""base freak"", then you can thump all of the base you want out of this Boombox. ""Boom"" is the right word..."
1,not as described,"The description is for a taller mini-muffin pan 1 1/4 inches tall.What I received was a mini-mini-muffin pan, only 13/16 inches tall.They actually look like nice pans --- but they are not the size described."
5,Great additional DVD for your collection.,This DVD is a 60 min sequence of different situations from their touring lives in the 90s. Some of the things are really extremely funny! Definitely a must-have for all reel Nsync fans (even after all the years although every one grew up by now).
3,It was okay but I still love them,I thought it was cute to see NSYNC back in the days. But I would have like to see them perform back then too. The video did not show them performing. It just showed them acting silly. They did show them performing but there was no music of theirs in it. I liked it though because they were so funny at times. You can tell they get along really well.
2,Disappointing,"I love watching documentaries about all kinds of topics, but I most enjoy science based documentaries. I would not even count this as a scientific documentary. It was more a personal interest story (I don't care if you commute or have kids, tell me about what you are doing to find the higgs!). It talks about some of the people who worked at fermi, but didn't really go anywhere. It didn't end with the finding of the higgs boson or the closing of the tevatron, it just ended. Of course they would still be filming if there was to be any conclusion, but I felt like it was a waste to time to watch."
3,Non-Fiction Documentary....,"Well, the Amazon site- as well as the streaming video recap- have this as ""starring Terrence Howard"". I figured it was a work of fiction loosely based on real scientific endeavors. Turns out it's just a documentary and has nothing at all to do with Mr. Howard. Someone at Amazon made a huge tiny mistake. It's pretty interesting in itself though. But I just wanted to clarify that this isn't really what it appears to be due to the Amazon error..."
2,not so good,my husband liked this movie...I was not impressed. Wouldn't watch it again or recommend it.
2,Walk the other way!!!!,I Walk The Line had major potential...but the ending to this film is lowsy!! If you want to see a film about an older man's obsession with a younger woman...see the far superior classic Lolita or the remake of Lolita from 1997!!!
5,Best teether for us,My daughter absolutely loves this teether. It is soft and squishy but gives enough resistance to meet her needs. It has held up to several weeks of intense use (still no teeth - yet!) and has saved my hands which until now have been her favorite teething toys. It is easily washed and the silly colors make it easy to find when it is dropped in the car.
3,great idea but not thought out,this would have been a great product if it actually fit in my son's mouth. he can't open his mouth wide enough. its big enough for me for heaven's sake. what were they thinking?....Update. My son is 8 months old and the teether finally fits. He likes it now. We needed it a few months ago as his fron teeth are already in. Maybe they need to create a smaller size.
2,"Good concept, poor design","This is a good idea for a teether since it's basically a bumpy pacifier that's easy to chew. However my son hated it. The actual raspberry part is way too big for a baby's mouth. We tried it a couple of times and he never took to it. Also, like many other reviewers, I wasn't too comfortable with the fact that the berry part seems to be glued on, posing a choking hazard. Overall not worth buying for us."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this teether because I thought it was a great idea and my daughter had been chewing on her paci anyway. When I handed her the teether, she popped it in her mouth like she usually does with her binky. Then she got a really funny look on her face, took it out, looked at it and threw it on the floor. And that's where it's stayed since we purchased it. I've tried multiple times to reintroduce her to it because I thought maybe it just threw her off at first but no. She's not interested in it at all. She would much rather use the other teethers we have. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my money."
2,Too bulky,"I agree with the reviewer who said that it seemed to big for her baby's mouth. That was my experience too, and I got it rather late for my daughter. My baby did take pacifiers, but did not like this one at all, she seemed to have trouble keeping it in her mouth comfortably. 99% of the time, she would end up turning it over and chewing on the ring. Overall, it did not at all provide us the relief I was looking for when my daughter started teething."
1,WAY too big!,"My three month old daughter is an early teether and I thought this product would be perfect for her as she is still too young to consciously use teething rings and other products of the like on her own. However, it is WAY too big to even get into her mouth and probably will be for some time; it's HUGE! This product seems great in theory, but they need to make age specific sizes or accurately advertise that the RaZ-berry is not designed for young teethers. Waste of money for me."
2,"Not for all babies, unfortunately :(","I am sure this is a great product (as seen by all the other reviews), but my 5-month nephew hates it. Perhaps it'll be useful when he gets older (the berry is kinda large), but he has started teething and I was disappointed to see that he doesn't want the RaZberry."
4,Baby doesn't like it as much as I thought he would.,It has a great feel to it but my son is more interested in chewing on the green portion I'm not sure but maybe the razberry portion is too large for him? He's 6 months and already has his bottom teeth coming through I got this instead of him chewing on my fingers because that hurts! I do like to give it to him to distract him from my fingers but it doesn't last long.
1,"cute for me, not appealing to my baby",I researched all the teething rings for my 1 year old and bought this one based on the great reviews. I think it's adorable. He does not care for it. He chews on it for about ten seconds and then he's back to using his fingers. Perhaps I introduced it too late. He also never took a pacifier (despite my persistent efforts). Better luck to other parents.
4,Perfect Teether,"We originally bought one off of Craigslist, but couldn't get it clean enough, so we bought one brand new and our 8 month old loves it. He doesn't much care for pacifiers, but this one is great. He even loves chewing on the handle. It's been worth it for us."
3,On the fence,"I think this product would be awesome if my baby teethed like normal kids. She doesn't chew and gnaw on things like the other kids I see. I bought her two of these and the Sophie Giraffe Teether, but she doesn't chew on them."
1,Kids not that interested in it.,"I bought a red one for my 8-month-old daughter, who is just getting her first teeth, and a blue one for my 2-year-old, who is getting his 2-year-molars. Neither child has been that interested in their Razberry teether. My 2-year-old has actually chewed off several of the little bumps without too much effort. Not worth the money if you already have a teether or two in your house."
2,Just ok,"I bought this for my 1 year old, I thought it would help with her teething. Unfortunately she doesn't like it, she really won't even put it in her mouth. The nipple part also seems very large... It might be great for other babies, but not for mine :-)"
2,Not Interested,"My baby is not a pacificer baby. She likes chrew toys tough. With that in mind, she is not interested in this razberry. She thought is was very pretty and played with it, but did not use it to chew or suck on."
3,Teethers....,"This teether is as good as any. No one has created one that children really like. Made well, just not for ours."
1,Not a teething pacifier; poor construction,"After I received this, I looked closely at the way it's constructed and noticed that at least one piece is glued on. (I was also surprised to find the note on the packaging that it's not a pacifier.) So I read more product reviews and found some disturbing testimonials that confirmed my fear about the poor construction -- not a chance I'm willing to take with my baby. I returned it without opening it."
4,Great but doesn't stay cold for long,We love this for our 7 month old daughter who is teething. Except that when taken out of the freezer it only stays cold for about 15min. Our daughter would prefer it stay cold longer.
1,My son didn't like it.....,I think the idea is great but my son just didn't like it. He LOVES his regular pacifiers so maybe thats why he wasn't that thrilled with one that was meant to be chewed on. He made a face every time he tried to use it. Oh well!
3,Expected baby to like this more,"We tried everything when our daughter was teething, including the raz-berry. At first she liked the novelty of the cold, but she never got into actually chewing on it. I think this may be because it is somewhat shaped like a pacifier and she never took to pacifiers either. Also, when frozen the plastic of the raspberry doesn't seem to give very much. Her favorite teether was Sophie the Giraffe. She also really enjoyed us putting ice cubes in the munchkin fresh food feeder bags. She loved that! If nothing else it was always a good distraction."
5,LOVE This teether...Purchased 2!,My daughter loved this so Much I had to purchase a second one. She chews on this thing like crazy when teething. It's also really cute when it's in her mouth. Great teether for babies.
3,"Eh, nothing special.","Not my daughter's favorite, but she does play with it now and then. She chews on the ""leaf"" part more than the raspberry actually and didn't care for it right out of the refrigerator. I probably wouldn't buy it again or recommend it just because there's better things out there."
3,Teether?,Our daughter likes to chew on this. The RaZ-Berry is a bit too large for her mouth so she ends up chewing on the ring end which is fine.
2,Doesn't stay cold,"My daughter really likes the cold of the frozen teether rings, but just can't seem to hold on to it long enough because it's too cold for her hands. I thought this would be great. After staying in the freezer overnight, this teether stays cold for about 15 seconds. Plus, the green ""leaf"" part (which covers half of her face) seems to be the only part that stays somewhat cold. It's not her cheeks that need soothing!"
2,not really working,"it's too big, my little one is 7 months and just picks it up and puts it in his mouth for just a sec and that is it, it's just too bulky. waste of our money..."
4,"Love this, but a little big","We ordered the RaZ-berry teether. It works great, but my daughter has a small mouth. It almost made her gag the first month. Overall a GREAT teether."
2,Diva's Mama,"My 9 month old didn't like it at all. The ""berry"" part is too big for her mouth. She just doesn't know what to do with it. But then she ever liked any pacifiers or any other teething toys. A wet washcloth or the soft spout of a sippy cup are the only safe solutions for us."
5,Truly speaking Nelson creates music from the heart,"Nelson Rangell's talent is displayed here in a nice collection of tunes which are melodic, powerful and another full plate release which he always provides with his musical creativity and instruments."
3,"Beautiful, comfortable, missized","I bought a pair of these in 14W, Cogniac. The make of the shoes is superior. Stitching is excellent both in style and mechanical assembly. The shoes are soft inside but give support.Overall, I really loved these shoes and wanted to keep them; however, they were not actually wide. Inside, they even say 14W, but my feet were just too big. The sides of the shoes bulged out past the soles. My other 14W shoes are wider. These pinch off from the ball of the foot forward."
3,Dud,Dudley Moore was not just a funny man but he was also a first class musician. This quality is well demonstrated in this collection. I love it.
5,Great Book,This is a great reference book for International Cub Cadet owners. You can find many facts about these mowers and Cub Loboys and Cub Tractors and find all the serial number changes. Highly recommend
4,Good to know,"I already knew most of the theory in this vid, but it was interesting to see Friedman's level of knowledge. Anyone who thinks this vid is boring should put down their guitar and shut the &#@$ up because i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Yes, this is universal theory, but it is important to all styles and important to overall musicianship. No, this may not share the same experience as watching Becker shred his *$$ off, but it provides knwowledge that any aspiring musician should definetely pickup on, if they already havn't. Great for beginners and intermediate players, in my opinion."
5,A wonderful book of poems,"When I read the poem ""Regrets"" I was very happy to reflect upon my life and I did not have any regrets.""A Valediction For my Father,"" what a beautiful love poem for a beloved father. I only hope my own children feel the same way about me. For some reason the poem ""Hotel Del Coronado SanDiego"" reminds me of a wonderful loveBallet by John Coltrain called ""Naima.""""19:41 Four Cups and the Dead African"" my heart goes out to Ahmadu Diallo, and all of the other victims of police brutality."
1,Broke after 10 hours of use (and cannot be repaired),"Used 4 pages at once and two of the plastic cogs that drive the blades broke. Contacted GBC and was told that replacement parts are not available and that the item cannot be repaired in general. As other users appear to have had similar experiences, I conclude this is a poorly designed product. The fact that replacement parts are not made available adds insult to injury. I will surely stay away from this manufacturer and I recommend you do the same."
2,Waste of Money,"The manual covers too many vehicles in general with little detail for specifics. It's difficult to find what your looking for. If you need a manual, try the dealer. I've had bad luck with Chilton in the past, I should have known."
3,Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manual,"The book I recieved & the book I ordered were different, but the model I needed happened to be in it. So i'm still happy w/ purchase. 7 days from payment to mailbox."
5,Wow. Simply Wow,"I first heard of this book in a review in Sports Car International magazine. As a dedicated Alfisti, I had to check it out. I was debating between the ($) printed version, or the ($) CD version. Needless to say, the CD version won. I was a little apprehensive about a ""book on computer"", but the authors did an amazing job. Basically, the navigation is through Powerpoint, so it's really easy to learn, once you figure out where exactly to click. Besides that, the sound and video clips make the CD worth it 10 times over. I couldn't believe some of the video, the blueprints, and such that were on the multimedia presentation. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in pre-war GP racing, or pre-war Italian autos."
5,Great book,"Can be applied to civilization on a whole..well written, in depth, easy read. Loved it, one of the best I've ever read."
3,"Good idea, but it leaks","I really love the idea and it isn't much of a hassle to tip the water bottle up and lock it into place, like some other reviewers are mentioning. But if it is full of water and not sitting upright it does tend to leak. I usual take it with me on hikes and just stick it in a side pocket on my backpack so it can sit upright, but if I couldn't do that it would be a big problem."
1,Never able to use,"Bought this product for our 2 dogs. Can't even put it together following the instructions, (while it spills all over), thus have never been able to use it. What a waste."
2,Water dispenser for dogs/cats/animals,"The novelty of this item is awesome and convenient, but after a few uses the nipple leaks. This is my second one and I thought if I just unscrew the cap each time and poor the water in the handy dandy dish, it would solve the problem of leaking. The dish is worthy but then taking another bottle defeats the purpose. I do not recommend this product."
2,not that handi,"I thought this would be great, but I was disappointed. It is NOT spill-proof; it leaks when you carry it in a bag. As mentioned by others it requires quite a bit of juggling to snap open, snap into place, then squeeze. Now I just fill a baggy with water at the water fountain in the park instead of using this."
