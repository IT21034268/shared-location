4,Pretty interesting,"if you like to learn about how people lived in other times. But, this is a history book. If you are looking for a swashbuckling adventure story then keep looking. One thing this will do is remind you how lucky we are to be alive today. Not that many British or French flotillas raiding our coasts these days."
2,Really?,I was so bored with this book that I couldn't even finish it (and I hate not finishing a book). It is jam packed with mundane details that left me completely uninterested. There are so many characters and sub stories that it's impossible to keep track of who's doing what? Example: The book goes out of it's way to describe in detail the financial background of Kidd's wife's first husband. I don't care! You want a good pirate book? Empire of Blue Water - Stephen Talty
3,get what you pay for,I thought this product would be more than what it is. Major latenecy issues even after I called the help desk.
1,""" Misleading"" It says speaker system","Beware, It says ""SPEAKER SYSTEM"" there is only one speaker in the box. Tell me what speaker system would include just one 6x9 speaker. They are not priced in pairs, like you would expect all other 6x9 speakers to be. Who buys just one 6x9 speaker. I have never seen a 6x9 speaker system that only includes one speaker. Now, I can either pay to ship it back or buy another one. Go figure, probably exactally what they wanted."
4,Pretty good collection,"This is a collection of short stories by authors associated with the ""cyberpunk movement"" within the science fiction field. I enjoyed the book overall, but I wouldn't necessarily call this a representation of cyberpunk. In fact, three of the stories to me (and more among others) absolutely do not qualify as such, and two of them actually seem to be more rooted in the fantasy field than anything else. However, it's a good read, definitely worth it for the stories by Willam Gibson, both solo and collaborative. Interestingly, my favorite was ""Petra"" by Greg Bear, which is one of the fantasies I referred to: a very original idea and superbly written.One final thing: if someone understands ""Tales of Houdini"", please contact me and explain. I just don't get it!"
5,"worth the money,buy this cd","i had never heard of this brother, just in tower records and there his cd was, so i took a chance and this is the best cd that i have purchased this whole year the brother is real,please buy this cd if you like good music"
5,Lyfe 268-192,This is what got Lyfe Jennings a new life. Everyone knows about this. Someone swiped my copy and I had to ge a new one. Highly Recommended.
1,"If u love D'ANGELO, Bilal or Van HUnt then don't buy this","Just received this cd, listened 2 it and threw it in the garbage at the trainstation...it's OVERPRODUCED GARBAGE.The lyrics are so cheezy.I'm NEVER going 2 trust amazon reviewers again after this,,,"
2,Lyfe As I Can't Understand,"I tried so hard to listen to his work but I'm not feeling it. Don't get me wrong his lyrical content is tight (especially wihth words of ""I Can't, ""Hypothetically"" and ""Years""), but it doesn't mesh well with the music (basically the music is so-so BUT his voice doesn't match up well with it).He's definetely a different artist that I haven't seen in awhile but overall, I just put this album back in my CD shelf or might give it to someone who is interested in him."
5,LYFE .....AS I KNOW IT !,"STORYTELLING AT IT'S ABSOLUTE BEST...URBAN AND GRITTY...LYFE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS !-HE POURS HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO EVERY TRACK...HE SINGS ABOUT THE GOOD AND BAD TIMES WITH SUCH INTENSITY. ""MUST BE NICE"" & 'I CAN'T' ARE AWESOME. ""THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU"" WILL HAVE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD AND SINGING TO THIS MELODIC MID-TEMPO GROOVE..LYFE DELIVERS A POWERHOUSE PERFORMANCE ON ""GREEDY""...THE HIT ""STICKUP KID"" IS TRULY AMAZING! ""CRY"" IS MESMERIZING..""SMILE"" IS INCREDIBLE..DON'T LET LYFE PASS YOU BY....THE MUSICAL PRODUCTION & VOCALS ON THIS CD ARE AUDIBLY SPECTACULAR! THE ENTIRE CD PLAYS LIKE A GOOD MOVIE ..I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT..I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WON APOLLO'S AMATEUR NIGHT 5 TIMES IN A ROW. PURCHASE THIS CD AND YOU WILL TOO !"
3,The right gift,This was a gift for a male friend who enjoys the Wolf symbol. He likes it very much. I thought it was smaller than the picture but it still had great detail and heaviness for it's size. It arrived on time and in great condition and safe packaging.
3,not the best at what it was designed to do,"I bought two of these and the corresponding fasteners. I followed the instruction exactly and used it to install about 250 4x10 sheets of 1 inch thick rigid board on vertical concrete. This was done using track that was nailed to the concrete. About half of the nails ended up blowing out the concrete as they tended to go in and immediately do a 90 degree turn. It took roughly two times the nails it should have to complete and a great deal more time. This set-up costs less than the ""high-pressure"" set-ups but definitely does not work as well."
5,great tenor voice,If you like great harmony and what I call the true high lonesome sound you'll love this CD
3,Worth One Viewing,"Beautiful photography of picturesque Heidelberg and the Technical University of Munich, another perfunctorily plausible performance by lead Franka Potente, assiduously crafted models in gruesome imitation of plasticized corpses and a handful of ingenious quirks can't overcome the fundamental silliness of Stefan Ruzowitzky's hit medical thriller. Seldom fearsome yet agreeably enjoyable, it's at least a couple rungs above most contemporary horror schlock, and an adequate amusement for an Autumn evening."
2,EURO SLASHER,"ANATOMY reminded me of some of those European horror flicks of the seventies like TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE or SUSPIRIA. Franka Potente (who gained American notice in the two BOURNE movies) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the Hippocratic oath. This society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who aren't dead! The movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes, and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike. The identity of the villain(s) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity, it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending, and with sequel written all over it. (ANATOMY 2 was made a couple years later). It's comparable to our teen slashers, but because of the foreign aspects, it seems a little cheesier."
5,"brilliant, for a horror movie","Why is it that the best horror movies are foreign? Is it that they are more intelligent and less likely to follow the tired, used conventions of Hollywood? ""Anatomie"" is basically a somewhat subdued slasher film, but it has the bonus of starring the always fabulous Franka Potente. Unlike the majority of horror movies, this one is WELL MADE and doesn't look like it was filmed in someone's backyard with a camcorder. Though like the majority of horror films, it is set in a college (it's always college or high school), and deals with something psychologically uncomfortable for everyone- possible dissection! Not to mention, the whole good vs. bad convention: is it a bad thing to perform inhumane studies on human cadavers if the research can possibly save lives in the future?P.S.- don't watch the sequel. ;)"
2,"They're soft, but thats seem to be it.","Not sure I can really tell if they are COOL (temperature wise) or not. They do seem to come apart and ball up a bit. After a some washing and wearing, I can't imagine they wouldn't develop holes after a while. Not worth the cost, IMO."
5,Excellent sock,"These socks are well padded in the sole and very comfortable! Good to wear around the house. In cold weather they keep your feet warm when in house, and keep feet warm when worn outside. Have not worn them in warm weather yet."
5,Heartfelt and REAL,This was the first book I read about grief and loss after my precious daughter was born still. It helped me feel a connection to other who had their babies die. It helped me feel like I was not as alone as I thought in this new world I never wanted to be a part of.
1,Not recommended to anybody,It is impossible to see who could learn anything useful by reading this book. No wonder that the author plays low stakes.
5,amazing,"this magazine is so great. i read it cover to cover every month. best summed up by its mission statement:""The Believer is a monthly magazine where length is no object. There are book reviews that are not necessarily timely, and that are very often very long. There are interviews that are also very long.We will focus on writers and books we like.We will give people and books the benefit of the doubt. ""so awesome! no ads! always super fulfilling!"
3,"not like the first, but still enjoyable","I enjoyed reading this sequel to Coyote Woman, however it was not as enjoyable as the first. It did have my attention, but unlike the first I was able to put Sun Priestess down. I think the writting was well done, and her descripions were fantastic, but the story line lacked something. In Coyote Woman, I felt that I grew with her...I felt her blossoming into a woman. In Sun Priestess...she seemed to stop growing, both spiritually and physically. I did enjoy the book, but I loved and re-read Coyote Woman"
3,Mediocre Product,"I received this product today. I was slightly disappointed and will probably not order from this company again. The elastic strap that holds the folder shut is stretched out and does not hold the folder securely shut. This was the biggest disappointment for the product. The lesser was the color. I figured it would be a ""brighter"" green but it is more of a ""forest"" green. I love lime green and was hoping it would be more ""limey"". I decided to just keep the folder despite the fact that it was damaged; I can easily fix the elastic strap with another piece of elastic from the store for like $0.50. So not worth sending it back and waiting for the new one when I need it now."
2,Disappointing,"I have several expanding portfolios in the same color from various companies. This expanding file doesnot open wide at the bottom. If you plan to cram a lot of receipts in each divided pocket, forget it. The cost is more than other expanding files of the same color and type."
3,"Bought 2, one was broken!","As title says.I bought 2 of these, one in blue and one in purple. And right off the bat the purple was torn down the side back seam of plastic. This means as im putting more papers into it, it is not holding its shape.Probably just luck of the draw, because the other one is worth every penny!"
5,2nd coming,"as Lyfe drops ""The Phoenix"" on us and it makes for an excellent listening experience throughout. The only thing i didnt care for was the interludes which make up almost half of the whole cds count. I'm all for an artist experimenting and what not, but not that much. But that aside Lyfe drops some gems on the listeners ""S.E.X"" with Lala Brown, ""The River"" and a few others.They make for what it is a well rounded 2nd release from an up and coming artist in Lyfe Jennings like the phoenix, full of energy and a fire that can't be put out by anyone. This cd helps showcase Lyfe as an artist and for the most part the guest stars are kept to a minimum thus keeping the focus on him.The Phoenix is a rebirth that the R&B...actually; the music world should be ready for like it or not."
4,A new narrative account of a fragmentary history.,"This book is an attempt to produce a coherent narrative political history of Hellenistic Athens out of the existing literary, and, above all, epigraphical evidence, as it intends to funcition as an updating of the earlier study on the subject matter by W.S. Ferguson, _Hellenistic Athens_. The author seems to use the evidence soundly, as there are no attempts to prove too much on a flimsy foundations. The account that emerges is well-reasoned and coherent. However, there is no historical interpretation for the depressing history of the transformation of the Classical Democratic Athens into the ""subject state with paltry politics""(Finley) of the Hellenistic Age. To that, one must search for the works by M.I. Finley (Politics in the Ancient World) and G.E.M. de Ste Croix(The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World), or then Paul Veyne's _Bread and Circus_(Le Pain et le Cirque), if one wants a non-_marxistisant_ interpretation ."
4,Colorful Addition,very colorful and better than plain plastic.The colors look great against the newly painted green walls. I pput similar colors in all the rooms to great effect.
1,Mind-Numbing,"Rarely in the history of cinema marketing (think Cinerama, 3-D, even John Waters' ""Smell-O-Rama"") has the initial exposure of a process or ""gimmick"" led to a more dreary filmgoing experience. Simultaneous release of a motion picture in theatres, TV, and DVD should be set back years and possibly terminated immediately by ""Bubble"". When you use non-professional actors, what appears to be washed-out Super 8mm film (its actually hi-def video), and have no motion (essential to ""moving pictures"" or we call the medium ""cave painting"") what can you possibly hope to achieve except ""amateur night at the movies"".If you want to know what average people talk about (or in this case, mumble about)visit a diner, but don't waste your time trying to maintain a conscious state with this dud."
1,"""Bubble is A BUST""",This movie is a waste of time. It is very amateur production. Very boring. Depicts the Mid Ohio Valley as being run down and poor. This movie is torture to watch. Lots of sitting around eating lunch in a breakroom. Lots of smoking. Didnt make much sense either. Extremely low budget.
4,Cutting Edge,"""Bubble"" is a faux-documentary. It explores the numbing boredom of factory work and the need of people who have no ability or appreciation of how to ""get a life,"" with the universal desire to connect. The photography and cinematography are outstanding, often evocative of Edward Hopper, and just as poignant. The non-professional cast is exceptional. The movie may be a turn-off to the cineplex movie-goer, who expects slick production values and polished performances. Kudos to Soderbergh and the Wagner/Mark Cuban production duo for giving the serious movie-goer a thought- provoking 75 minutes in the dark."
1,God-awful boring.,Neat experiment but unfortunately one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I think I read like they ad-libbed the script or something? I'm sure someone will say they didn't and the genius of the movie was that it looked like they did. God-awful boring.
4,Pub Quiz,"Great starter book for a pub quiz, catorgories were great and format easy to follow. Jolly Drayman pub quiz was a huge success due to the book."
4,Funny guy,Very good. Some of the stories were the same as on other CDs. Always funny and educational.I'd love to know his background
5,er review,I have been an ER fan and I enjoyed this viewing. If you are a serious fan be sure to catch all the older episodes they are worth watching.
4,ER Eagerness,"I too am a fan of the show and have fallen short on this long term release as well. I'm sort of disapointed in the red box deal, I think that it looks better, but they should have started it to begin with. Anyways, it's amazing how enthusiastic a person can get just waiting for the release of a daytime series that I could easily watch on the telly.I guess when I think about it though ER really is the only daytime drama that I can sit through, so to have it at my disposal at times would be assuring. Only gave it 4 stars for the box change and the fact that I haven't seen the third season yet."
2,boring,"After years of hearing the hype about this show, I finally bought the DVD's and was completely bored with season 1,2and 3 and returned season 4,5,&6 to Target...did not click with me."
3,Not the Best Season,"After watching some of the shows on TNT, I loved ER i have seasons 1-6 and imn almost done with season 5 and without a doubt season 3 is my least. It is still good but it doesnt quite compare to the other seasons. Some highlights for me would be ""Night Shift"" when the ER loses a cast member. I was totally shocked to see that happen. Racism comes face to face with Dr. Greene in ""Tribes"", and he gets beat up bad in a later episode. All in all it was a good year for ER, certainly not the best but well worth the money"
4,Why Not a Sequel?!,This book informative but it's also hilarious. It taught me a lot about the feline mind and all that stuff; and it had such funny pictures! Any cat lover must get this book. the only downside to this book is that it's so expensive. I would get it from amazon.com because at the store it's 18 dollars. But 15 is still very high for such a small book.
4,Surprisingly Fascinating,"A few years ago, I was given the companion to this book,Why Paint Cats: The Ethics of Feline Aesthetics, and I personally found it a little ridiculous, but loved the photos. So, when I saw this at my local store, I just picked it up for a glance, expecting the same kind of ""well, some people are just weird"" reaction. However, as a big believer in animal consciousness, I was immediately entranced with the stories and background of these animals who clearly had more to ""say"" than the average person would think. The pictures are beautiful and, even when the stories of the ""famous artists"" get a little overblown, the crux of each is entrancing.Apparently, the books available here are the miniatures, which aren't likely to give good quality of the pictures. You can find the full size coffee-table books at most bookstores. I found mine, and several other copies, at a used bookstore in town."
2,Not a great field guide,"This book seems to have great information and great pictures. However, the pictures of the mushrooms and the descriptions are not together. There isn't even a page reference matching pictures and information. I couldn't find which are edible and which aren't. Maybe it was there, but too hard to find."
5,Most comprehensive mushroom field guide available,"The Audubon Society does it again, and again. This book is the most comprehensive field guide to North American mushrooms I've been able to locate. I loved it so much, I had to order another copy because my old one wore out."
3,I didn't die yet,So far I ate some mushrooms that I identified from the book and am still alive to tell about it. I use the book coupled with internet searches and stick to the obvious ones to be safe. Interesting to look others up though.
1,Worst mushroom book ever seen,"Don't buy it, it's a useless book, why a book without scientific names can work, the paper look like a pocket bible, amazon put this book as it were important but shouldn't be there."
4,The best North American field guide,"This is a fine field guide, overall. It's not designed for total beginners -- those folks should get some experienced assistance before trying to identify mushrooms with this book alone. But once you know the basics, this guide can be your first reference, and the only one you carry in your pack.Of the five field guides I have owned, this is by far the best for North American mushrooms. Still, no guide is 100% complete, so having some alternative guides to refer to is a good idea. Also, while it is described as ""leather bound,"" my copy and all others I have seen actually are bound in vinyl with a leather-like texture stamped on it. Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting a real leather-bound book. Of course, vinyl is more practical for field use anyway, where you are likely to get the book wet!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Though it's Audobon, it's not a comprehensive guide to North American mushrooms. Also grouped by colloquial or made-up names. This book has many mushrooms from all across the country but skips even more. If you use this for general identification you'll be lucky to identify anything. If you're looking to identify things get a book localized to the area you're in. Other than that, it has pretty pictures and can ID some of the most major mushrooms in the country.-- JJ Timmins"
3,Faults?,"Being a teacher, we are supposed to come up with positive ways to address things to our students. This book ""Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults"" deals all about the bad stuff to look for in a vocal choir. It seems as though it could be written a little more positively. Being forced to read stuff with a negative mindframe is not my cup of tea!"
2,cheesy,"""Ulladubulla"" features remixes of individual tracks from Jeff Wayne's 70s pop opera ""War of the Worlds"". There's no attention paid to narrative, so the remixes are in random order with little dialogue, and the second cd of the set is simply full length versions of several tracks on the first cd. So you'd be buying this, then, for its worth as a user-friendly dance remix - however, most of the remixes are very cheesy house versions (I don't know where previous reviewers have found 'rap' and 'hip hop' on this release - there are no 'new' vocals and remixers Dario G and N Trance are typical examples of cheesy, faceless mainstream acts), so this particular release works best gathering dust."
1,War of the Worlds (Remixed) [IMPORT] ~ Jeff Wayne,Too bad the lowest I could give this CD is a one! It is more deserving of a .001. Do NOT under any circumstances buy this CD if you want the stirring version of the War of the Worlds Mr. Wayne entertained us with in the 70s. I had two vinyl record sets and wore out two 8-track sets (yes I'm that old!). On this collection all you will hear is hip hop and none of what you fondly remember! There is no trace of the performance I remember-- just hip hop! I can't even picture why anyone into hip hop would want this CD set. They weren't even born when the original was made and they wouldn't be buying this MONSTER RIP OFF at over $30.00 including shipping for any kind of reasons of nostalgia! Keep on looking and don't get burned like I did-- avoid this like the plague!
1,Full of stereotypes,"I bought this book hoping to gain insight into the minds and customs of my foreign business associates. I was sadly disappointed. As a European who has lived in Italy my entire life, I can say with 100% certainty that all of the information and advice in this book draws on age old stereotypes. For example, the lazy Southern Europeans, the cold Scandinavians, the pub hopping British and the industrial Germans.This book will not help anyone improve relations with Europeans. It will only enforce false stereotypes and foster misunderstandings of other cultures."
5,"Beautifully developed, satisfying little move (rare!)","I came to this movie with no real knowledge of the working environment in Japan. It was quickly apparent to me, however, that the characters were drawn as delightful hyperboles that only enhanced the genius of this superb little movie. I guess some people need stark realism in every movie they see. As for me, I like a well-crafted story that is well acted and that takes me somewhere I've never been before, and FEAR AND TREMBLING certainly fits that bill.The movie was so beautifully developed that I was afraid it was going to let me down in the end. It didn't. I would not have changed a single moment and found myself fully satisfied, which rarely happens in movie watching. I saw it online at a movie rental site and gave it 5 stars there too, another thing I rarely do.One hundred seven minutes of pure enjoyment."
5,A must see film for those who want to understand Japanese,"This film is both funny and it teaches you a lot about the Japanese way of life and the huge difference between it and a Western culture. Recommended for people who want to learn about Japan, but it's also a very entertaining film."
4,DOC FORD #4,"Randy Wayne White's fourth book with hero Doc Ford, government agent turned marine biologist. I love this series and the third one, THE MAN WHO INVENTED FLORIDA was a favorite, this was good too. Tomlinson, Ford's hippie friend, pulls Doc into a mystery with a death from an explosion at Dinkin's Bay. We learn a lot about reoccurring Tomlinson in this good mystery. RECOMMENDED Read Doc Ford in order, remember this is number four."
2,Awesome build quality but...**UPDATE**,"...it won't lock. I bought this just over a month ago to use for my storage unit. I wanted something more than your average lock to protect my belongings so I bought this after looking at amateur lock picking sites like the reviewer above me. I would have tested it, but I wasn't going to be at my storage unit for another month, so the most BASIC thing that I trusted this lock to do - it fails at. Mine looks and feels like it locks, but give it a quick tug and it comes right out with not much resistance, but there is some.Now I'm just past my 30 days so I cannot return it, so for others, if you purchase this, test it right away before it's too late.**UPDATE** I reached out to Hampton Products who the Brinks name belongs to and they sent me a new lock with no issues. Arrived and works perfectly."
4,"Rada cutlery- very sharp, good looking","Bought the set for food prep work. Found it to be high quality, extremely sharp right out of the box. The hook blade is quite useful for peeling. The only reservation I have concerns the ability to hold an edge through use: the hook blade is already needing touch-up after about 2 weeks of moderate use. This is not a serious draw-back, however. I like the handles: slip-resistent, and bullet proof. Overall, a quality set at a reasonable price."
5,It's made by Fiskars - get it!,"I'm getting new gardening supplies in anticipation of spring - I have many Fiskars products (mostly scissors) and love the quality. I love this trowel. The handle is big enough to hold on to when I'm breaking up dirt in my planters. And it's pretty, in a rugged sort of way. I'm well satisfied, esp. with the price (and free shipping with Amazon Prime)."
1,Not a durable Trowel,"For the first week, I loved this little shovel. Then, my husband used it to dig a small hole in regular soil and it snapped in two."
4,"Well made, but ages rapidly.","This sturdy trowel fits my needs exactly, my only surprise is that after a week outside, the orange part has faded almost to white and the metal is covered with a fine layer of oxidation. This is only cosmetic and in no way compromises the utility.I'm happy with the purchase, and would buy it again."
5,"A Golden ""Must-Have"" CD",This superb collection is so good--these are precious songs rarely heard anymore; some no longer in circulation today. They are guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories.
1,THE PRAYER OF DAVID:IN TIMES OF TROUBLE,"THESE BOOKS ARE BEING SENT TO MY SON, WILLIAM LONGLEY IN PRISON. HE HAS NOT RECEIVED THESE BOOKS. HE THINKS THE GUARDS ARE KEEPING THEM. CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY INFO ON EVIDENCE YOU RECEIVE THAT SHOWS THE BOOKS WERE DELIVERED THERE?I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU HELP IN THIS MATTER.THANK YOU, SHARON SAMS"
2,I think I've grown out horror stories.,"Unfortunately, the fact is that it is difficult to be scared by books. Horror is a genre that tends to better as films. This book failed to make me afraid and thus I found it boring. However It was a little interesting at times and, to be fair, it is supposd to be one of the scarier novels down the timeline.The story was very predictable all the way through. It was obvious what Barlow was. It was additionally flawed by Stepehen King trying to show off his writing skills. Some of his long and 'clever' descriptions were irritating rather than helpful in jogging your imagination, making the story even more bland and fearless.Those of you that are quite easily scared of horror novels will probably like this, a lot. Unfortunately I don't seem to get scared much anymore, which is a shame really. This book failed to changed that."
3,Half of it was good,"I generally have a hard time reading books that start off slow. But reading the reviews i knew i just had to get through the first half. Once i did, it definitely kept my attention. The last half is so much better than the first half. There are still some slow parts in the second part but nothing too hard to get through. I don't get scared by books probably because i can't visualize it well enough, but i would say there are definitely some creepy parts."
5,Vintage Stephen King,"""Salem's Lot"" is Stephen King's second novel and one of his best. The dry, almost understated tone of the writing lends itself superbly to the terror building ever so slowly, ever so insidiously, until he hits us dead on with ""the high, sweet, evil laughter of a child... and then the sucking sounds"". From there, the horror explodes as victim after victim falls prey to the monstrosity that has taken over this small town in southeastern Maine. King is a master at interspersing the horror with flashes of humor (his description of the town drunks driving out to the haunted dump is a howler) and, unlike some of his later over-long books in which the story drags on and on and on, in ""Salem's Lot"" he knew where to end it. For those fans who hoped for a sequel, check out ""One For the Road"" in King's collection of short stories called ""Night Shift""; it's set in Salem's Lot, and the vampires are back... and very, very thirsty."
3,Okay-ish King version on the whole vampire genre,"What is everybody raving about? OK, so it builds up to a nice scary climax towards the end, but it's much too slow to start, and the beginning dictates which of the characters survive (why does Stephen King always DO that?), and even at its best it doesn't come close to the heights of his later stuff. Like all King's early novels, there's nothing new in it, and for anyone who's read anything later I'd say skip this one and stick to the more recent stuff. (Also a nice UK-friendly message in that the only British character to ever appear in one of King's novels is the chief vampire in this one!)"
3,Enjoyable but...,"it just wasnt anything really new.After reading I Am Legend, i spotted many things that King stole from that book, and King was an admitted fan of Matheson's. Hmm.I still give it 3 stars though because of the scene with one particular female in one particular house. That was a creepy chapter or two..."
5,Vintage King. Best vampire novel I've ever read.,"This is the only vampire novel I've read that's come close to scaring me, and scare me it did. I finished reading it for the 3rd time (the 1st was 15 years ago and I read it again 5 years ago) & I finished it in two days. I think King's works from the 70's & early 80's were by far his best stuff & this is one of the great ones. You have to try it for yourself to understand what a good storyteller he is. King describes a typical small New England town with in-depth characters that slowly but surely begins to be colonized by vampires. The story is so well written that it's quite believable...much better than anything I've read by Anne Rice. There's a number of edge-of-your seat moments & the climax is quite dark. There's no total triumph of good over evil here...at the end you don't know if the vampires or the humans will ultimately prevail. If you haven't read King before this is an excellent place to start."
5,This book is so freakin' scary!,"This was definately a good book! Other than the Green Mile Series this is the first Stephen King full pledged novel I have ever read. I think that the way he portrays the characters and the detail of the settings really made the book frightening. At first it kind of dragged but once you get into the characters and the situations, it seems so real. I have seen the movie and it also rocks. But as everyone knows, the books are always better than the movie. At least that's my opinion. I truthfully recomend this book if you like to be scared."
4,salem's Lot - FORGET THE MOVIE. THIS IS BETTER,"I'd read the book and I've seen the ""miniseries"" and the book as always was better. If you have not read salem's Lot, go read it. It's humorous, dark, eerie, and just overall great. The beginning seems a bit out of place but, eventually ties it up around the end. If your not a fan or horror or horror tinged novels I'd suggest you to maybe avoid it. In short, this book is a good read."
4,Entertaining,"Not really knowing what was going on in the Lot at the start of the book was pretty scary. Once the cat was out of the bag, the fear factor also went out of the bag. Regardless, this was still a well-written novel and I still highly recommend this to SK fans."
3,Too Much Fat,"There was too much fat in this book, but then, that could be said for the vast majority of King's novels. Like Dean Koontz, King needs a different editor. There was too much unnecessary information that slowed down the plot. If the book had been cut by 20%, it would have been a much more enjoyable read. As it was, I struggled to maintain interest and took a whole year to get through it. Also, I didn't really care who died and who didn't--didn't connect emotionally with any of the characters. Of course, it was only his second book, right? So I'll cut him a little slack for that and give the book a ""3"" instead of a ""2""."
3,Hmm. Looks like I enjoyed this book as much as the two made for tv movies,"I read all of kings Dark Tower series and loved Father Calahan. He was the reason I read this book. I'm not sure how I could love the dark tower, then hate this book. It didn't frighten me at all. I thought the book could have been shorter. After reading this book I watched the original movie. If you've seen it, you know how bad it was. The remake was almost just as bad, although I liked the ""sad"" ending better. The kid who likes Hodini (how ever it's spelled) was an interesting character in the book. Maybe I just need to read another King book. HA!!! I do have a hardback first edition of ""It"" just sitting in my room. I'll check it out. Most of Kings fans seem to enjoy that one."
4,Vampires in the USA.,"'SALEM'S LOT is another fine work by Stephen King. What would happen if the story of Dracula took place in small town America? That's the basic premise of this novel. An ancient vacant house in a small Maine village is occupied and a famous author moves to Jerusalem's Lot all on the same day. People begin to disappear and hardly anyone suspects a thing. Who knows what could be hiding in the cellar or under the house in 'Salem's Lot?As someone who has just recently become a King fan, I was once again impressed by King's masterful storytelling. Nevertheless, I was able to distinguish that this is a work from earlier in King's career: there were a few ends left open and elements of the story weren't as tight as they are in some of King's later works. However, this was still a great book. You probably won't be able to put it down and you may not fall asleep at night."
1,BORING!!!!!,"This was awful! A boring commentry on the undead, with no memorable characters, nothing of interest, in fact nothing good to say about it at all!! Read the Stand, it's a billion times better. This book disgusted me, it was so bad. Normally I love King, but here...."
4,Well worth 4 stars for a vampyre story........,"'salems lot, (Jerusalems Lot) is a good read, and is marginally scary. It is, as i have said, a vampyre story and is a bout a writer going back to a spooky house to write about it. A strange man enters town and the word vampyre is on everyones lips. Prepare for the spillage of blood."
3,"Good, in spurts","It took me roughly 100 pages to think reading this book was worthwhile. The build up takes too long and the human relationships don't seem real at all. When the novel is scary it works. But that's for such a brief period of time that I felt drained reading all of the filler. I must confess I'm not a Stephen King fan, but I'm not anti either. So, if you are a fan you'll probably dig it."
5,My first camcorder and so far I like it,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, I really glad I bought this camera because so far I really satisfied with this camcorder.All the problems with Elura 40MC,low light quality and motor noise, I did not find it in this model.My wife taking a lot of taping for my 6 months baby activity :)"
2,Camera Broke after 1 Year,Just after the warranty expired the CCD electronics failed on my camera redering it useless. Given all the other complaints on Amazon re: this model of camera I would advise against buying it as it appears to be unreliable.
2,A Date with the Other Side,"In all her years leading tours of haunted houses, Shelby's not had so much as a glimpse of ectoplasm- and she still hasn't. Boston Macnamara is no ghost, he just happens to have taken residence in one of the haunted houses. Now its up to some meddling spooks to set up Shelby Tucker and Boston Macnamara in a romance, despite their differences.** Though the premise is fascinating, that is the very fact that makes the let down so disappointing. It's not quite pwp, but gets really close at times, with very little depth to the characterizations. **"
1,Description is deceptive,"Advertised to be able to fit all luggage racks, including FACTORY racks. What the description does NOT tell you however is that you need to purchase almost another $60 worth of hardware or spend $400 on one of their racks for these saddles to work. I am sure they would work fine, but I had to return the items immediately. Amazon handled the return promptly and properly."
5,Smart and yet Simple,"How nice to read about maintaining a successful relationship without having to read a lengthy book full of analysis. You get it all here, but simply and by cutting to the quick: 'Don't let little things become big things.' 'Don't overlook little things.' How true, how simple, how often forgotten. A great little gift for newly engaged or with your favorite reference books! The humor mixed with the seriousness helps me when my spouse and I read it together. We love it, and it reminds us how a little effort goes a long way."
4,quality and value,"These Hifonics speakers sound alot better than the price would have you believe. The materials used in these speakers are also very good . I always look for speakers that have cone material other than paper and surrounds made of rubber not foam. Important for speakers that live in the harsh environment of a car. The Hifonics Zeus ZXI63 seem like they will hold up just fine and they sound pretty darn good. I have them hooked up directly to my deck so they are not getting a whole lot of power but the bass sounds punchy and adequate (not a lot of low bass power). The mids and highs are clear with enough presence and sparkle to make your music interesting. I'm sure these speakers would sound better powered by a separate amp but for not much money they upgraded the sound of my system. They are not Hi End, they are value oriented and they are recommended."
5,Exciting Characters Make This a Quick Read,"The narrator, Andy Martin, comes out in a big way after his wife leaves him and he meets Tysin, a bartender in a gay bar. Andy believes Tysin to be an angel sent to save him, but is he? This book effectively deals with coming out, but more importantly, with coming to terms with your sexuality. Andy's search for love and happiness is long, grueling, and selfish, when what he's so desperately searching for may have been right there all along. Morton's saga is often funny and touching, but ultimately haunting. Just when you think you've got Andy figured out he goes in a different direction. One man's journey to find himself in a city that is unyielding and stifling--like a St.Louis summer."
4,"OLD SKOOL MEETS NU SCHOOL - Lady Kier, Kelli Ali, Prince?!","I found this in the bargain bins and was mighty surprised - rather than toss off a dated 80s retro flashback, Bootsy has delivered the perfect blend of old-skool vs. nu-school funk to bring him up to date - with the help of tasty vocal contributions from LADY KIER (DEEE-LITE!), ROSIE GAINES (ex-PRINCE ""Diamonds and Pearls"" amazing singer!), FATBOY SLIM, KELLI ALI (ex-SNEAKER PIMPS), this is really a surprisingly consistent jam of the year! The biggest mystery is the singer ""ONE"" who sounds awfully a lot like PRINCE (?!) - is it PRINCE or one of his psuedonyms or what?! Whatever the verdict, many of these tracks sounds like ""LET'S WORK/WANNA BE YOUR LOVER"" stripped-down early PURPLE ONE FUNK! Get it now - this was first released on Warners on import, now licensed to THUMP, who def have good ears! Support funk, BUY BOOTSY!!"
1,Not the Bootsy I know,"I am a long time Bootsy fan, love all of his previous works, even the projects he's done without George, but this one takes the cake i mean this is hourable, whatever happen to the nice chous Bootsy use to have, and who are all these people on this CD, I know Snoop, but none of these guys can bring the FUNK like George Clinton, man bootsy this is your worst work ever, and I thought I'd never have to say that. Stick to your original sound forget trying to blend in with the new because most of this stuff out here is pure garbage anyway, and that's probably why your CD came out that way. Stick to what you do best, and ask George to help on your next project, see that;s what made yall different from the rest yall got that original flava that last a life time, these new groups, their just fly by night one hit fonders, nobodies gona look for their music in the next 10 years, don't bring anymore garbage out like that again Bootsy, you need to come correct mor don't come at all."
5,Loved for a Lifetime!,"It fits with everything, every mood, seductive,am always complimented. Its for men but morefitting for a woman of power!"
3,"a ""guy's book""","This book is really good, but it seems like it's more for a guy. I didn't find some stuff too interesting because it sounded like it was directed more towards the males in this world. It's still a great book to read though."
2,Not too good,This book isn't any good. I expected a lot more from him. It mostly talks about women that he wanted to sleep with.
2,Not so Good,"Tim Allen is hilarious in his TV show and stand up acts, but this book was pretty weak. The whole book was worth about 3 good chuckles and that's it. The rating would be even lower, but I like Tim Allen and thought I should cut him some slack for being a first time author. Sein Language and Paul Reiser's Couplehood were much better in this type of book."
2,NOT The DaVinci Code!!!,"After I read The DaVinci Code, I was thirsty for more books like it; with its depth and intrigue, it was one of the most readable and fascinating books I have read in a long time. However, I found that Angels & Demons stretched the limits of credibility beyond the breaking point. Super humans and super demons were abundant, and the lines were crossed far too many times. I am willing to go with a writer and to suspend disbelief with the best of them, but this one made me feel jerked around. Though I stuck with it and read through to the disappointing end, I did not feel good about my efforts. I was expecting another DaVinci, but was sorely disappointed. Had I read this one first, I would have skipped the far superior product."
1,Pretty awful,"I guess my expectations were too high given the other reviews of this book and the description of the plot. Maybe Mr. Brown's writing improved as he wrote more books, but I find this book unreadable. In particular, he doesn't make logical transitions from the end of one scene to the next. For example in an early scene, he leaves the hero with his skin crawling with apparently overwhelming horror at something he sees. When this scene is continued just a few pages later, it does not continue or explain the earlier reaction. I kept going between the two trying to figure out what happened.I decided I just couldn't continue with the book, it is just so badly written. I recommend Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum (which appears to have ""inspired"" this book) instead."
3,Ready For Its Close Up.,"I think I was one of the few people who didn't absolutely love ""The DaVinci Code"". A friend suggested I read this telling me it was a better story, and upon finishing I have to agree. After now having read his two biggest novels I've come to the conclusion Dan Brown writes the literary equivalent to the summer blockbuster movie. A huge plot that barrels along at a breakneck pace, daring and heart pounding action sequences, and characters that have stilted dialogue but are used for their specific purpose to move the plot along.(Not that there's anything wrong with that.) This involves a Harvard symbologist, called to help unravel an ancient mystery involving a secret brotherhood that is out to destroy the Catholic Church. The debate between science and religion is played against the backdrop of the Vatican city while the city itself is facing complete destruction in a matter of hours. Perfect movie setup.Too bad Harrison Ford, is too old for Langdon...Dennis Quaid perhaps?"
2,Why o why did he had to writte the last 2 chapters?,"Yet another attempt to take a swing at the Catholic Church!! The books starts OK, an interesting thriller with some basic historical facts and good narrative, but instead of ending it on the right page, the author comes up with a ludicrous story about in vitro fertilization between a priest and a nun and twists an almost believable plot into a piece of trash nor worthy of the foulest waste-basket."
1,Oh please!!!!!!!,"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I found this novel to be poorly written and full of clichés despite an interesting premise. It reads like an old dime store novel in spite of purporting to have scholarly undercurrents. The writing is amateurish, and the characters are all stereotypes. The twisty storyline wears out its welcome by twisting well past its logical dénouement. By the last third of the book I was getting really annoyed with the writing and wanted the book to end.Dan Brown takes an interesting idea and hammers the life out of it in this cheap ""pulp fiction-esque"" effort. It'll pass the time, but don't expect much."
5,If you like The Da Vinci Code...,"Plainly put, if you likedThe Da Vinci Code: the Illustrated Editionyou will very much like this book. Highly recommended."
1,One of the great mysteries of literature...,"...namely, why the hell does anyone buy this guy's books, let alone enough of them to propel them to best-seller status?Crude prose, mechanical plotting, ludicrous motivations, cheap suspense tricks, shoddy scholarship and geography, cardboard characters: lord, the list goes on.Seriously, save your money. Maybe its follow-up, ''The Da Vinci Code"", takes an enormous leap in quality, but I'm not willing to test that theory without some firm evidence."
5,One of my favorite books,"The quality of the paper and the illustrations is excellent. The illustrations make the story easy to follow, understand and visualize. I definitely prefer the illustrated version over the regular one. I would also recommend The DaVinci Code Illustrated version."
5,Amazing,"Dan Brown is incredible. The plot was chock full of action and suspense when I least expected it. The storyline kept thickening, like a spiral, continuosly getting deeper and deeper into what's going on, random twists and turns and surprises everywhere. The writing style is wonderful and as the reader I could really put myself in the place of our hero, which was thrilling. One of the best books I've ever borrowed. I couldn't put it down, and in fact got most of my friends to read it too."
5,angels and demons....the GREATEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ,"to say this book was great would be an understatement. i havent been this entertained by reading a book ever. filled with tons of action and a great story, i absolutely loved the science and religion background of the book. i cant wait to see if this book is turned into a movie, it would make one hell of a movie. i recommend this book to anyone!!!A++++++++++++++"
3,"Flawed book, but fun","This book is hindered by flat characters, plot holes, and implausible scenarios. Despite that, however, I enjoyed it. I liked the basic plot line and the various clues and treasure hunt-type atmosphere it provided. The ending especially lacked plausibility, but I was able to forgive that because of the book's overall entertaining value.Basically, if you're a stickler for detail and no loose ends, this is not the book for you. If you want just a fun story, however, this might work if there's nothing else you're dying to read."
4,keeps you on edge,"It is the first Dan Brown book that I read, and I must say that his writing style captivated me. The story is full of action and unanticipated turns. Definately a recommended read."
2,Nowhere near as good as The Da Vinci Code,"This is a messy, often boring and somewhat ridiculous novel. After reading The Da Vinci Code I picked this up expecting a silly but entertaining page-turner. What I got was not only silly but downright retarded. The villain in this book made me laugh. Oh, and the ""surprise twist"" at the end is super-predictable. Don't pick this up unless you're in the mood for a laugh (and a lot of eye-rolling)."
1,I felt cheated! Don't bother!,"I just put down the ""Davinci Code"" and I couldn't wait to read more, so I picked up ""Angels and Demons"". Wonderful! I FIRST thought....I was mesmorized at the beginnning of the book - then (UNFORTUNATELY) - I get to the end and the book and it totally untangles with ridiculous events.After I read the Davinci Code, I talked about it and lent the book to my friends. But Angels and Demons went right into the trash!"
1,Very disappointing,"This book is very disappointing. Almost all the quotations in Italian are misspelled and sometimes written in a very poor dialect. Even the names of the most important locations inside the Vatican are ridiculously misspelled. It seems like the author did not spend much time in checking names and quotations. I found this offensive! The author is not aware of the fact the Swiss Guards are only one of the two `armies' of the Vatican. He is also not aware of the titles of the hierarchy of the `Curia Romana'. And I have only read 130 pages... I'll keep you posted. Mr. Brown, how is it possible to contact you?"
2,Da Vinci Code- Beta version 1.0,"The editor was asleep at the wheel for this one. So many goofs. There's a lot of bad hokey stuff in this book that makes me scratch my head and wonder WHY or HOW dumb do you think people are? That kind of thing should be cleaned up by the editor.But!!If you liked The Da Vinci Code, you will enjoy this book. The formula is the same:Church vs enemy (science in this case)Langdon teamed up with smart female love interestZealot badguy on the looseLots of clues to solveBig finishWhat a stinker!"
4,Edge of your seat fun!,"This was such a good book. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. I liked it even better than the Da Vinci Code. This is another book about Robert Langdon as he is on a mission to stop the Vatican from getting blown up from a santanic group called the Illumanati. My only complaint was that it kinda of started out slow, but once you get to around page 150 it gets exciting and doesn't let up. I can't wait for the next book and the movie"
3,Eh,"I'm thinking anyone who gave this more than four stars doesn't read very much.This book was extremely enjoyable to read. It keeps you interested and motivated to keep reading. And, for the most part, you are rewarded for your continued attention.Some of it, though, is entirely predictable. Some of it is entirely unrealistic. And most of the characters aren't very well-developed.I don't know about all the religious mumbo-jumbo, and I don't much care if it's true or not. It's a story, for corn's sake. If you're demanding historical accuracy, build a time machine. Don't read books. There's just no such thing."
3,Disappointing after Da Vinci Code. Too long,"I really enjoyed The Davinci Code. Then I went back to read Angels and Demons hoping for more of the same. It started out ok, then kind of drifted aimlessly, and then seemed to be more of an Indiana Jones type story for awhile, then ended weakly. I couldn't wait for it to end, quite unlike how I felt reading The DaVinci Code. I was recommended to read Dan Brown's earlier novels, but after this one, I can see why he went somewhat unnoticed until The Davinci Code."
3,good story /decent writing,and entertaining and light read. it does get a little preachy at the end though
5,Incredible,"Hard to put down. Once you start reading it, you can't stop until you find out what happens. A fantastic book."
1,A WASTE OF VALUABLE READING TIME,"All I can say is that if I'd read this first, I'd never have read The DaVinci Code. That helicopter jump, really believable. I almost just stopped reading, but I finished."
4,Good enough to please !,"Finished this book in a day. OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer."
2,Purchase review,"The book I received wasn't the one I expected... Personally, I thought I will be getting the one in the picture above which has a hardcover... The one I got is a paperback one... The contents are the same indeed but the cover is not the one I wanted... I have a collection for Dan Brown illustrated version (lost symbol and Davinci code) both with hardcover and I was hoping to complete the collection with Angels and Demons..."
4,Good....but not up to par with Da Vinci Code,"I read Angels and Demons AFTER I read The Da Vinci Code. I would say that I am glad I read the Da Vinci Code first, because it is almost the same premise as Angels. Waking up at a ridiculous hour by a mysterious phone call. Beautiful, intelligent woman...trip that leads to only God knows where. Same. Personally, I felt that the Da Vinci Code's overall topic was more interesting, but Dan Brown uses the same intriguing histroical facts here too. I want to caution readers about some reviews that call this book religious. It may take place in something religious, namely the Vatican...but it is by no means preachy or biblical. Like I said...good...but not great"
4,Thrilling!!!,"I read this book after reading The Da Vinci Code. I was a bit concerned it would be too much the same. However, while there were some similarities in the plot, it was different enough to make it equally enjoyable. Highly recommended!! You'll devour it in a weekend."
2,I felt cheated... read DVC and stop there,"I have to admit that, while I found myself annoyed for enjoying the _DaVinci Code_, I felt possitively duped into getting _Angels & Demons_. Okay, the parts regarding the selection of the Pope and the inner-workings of the Vatican and Catholic hierarchy was fascinating. However, unlike _DVC_, I just could not suspend my disbelief and let myself be swept into the story, which, by the way, went on and on and on and on and... several false endings later, I just felt disappointed in myself for being swept into the hype.I did like the clues and the ambigrams, and I did like descriptions of Rome and the art... like its sequel, _A&D;_ made me want to look deeper into the artists described. However, I shall not read any more of Dan Brown's books. _The DaVinci Code_ is a much better story, read it and be satisfied. Or if this was your starting point and you didn't like it, go on to _DVC_."
3,brown just couldn't end it,"angels and demons. starts slow, gets better, however, along about the last 1/3 of the book the science becomes wonkier than chaos theory on lsd. most of the science throughout the book works, and, believe it or not there is a basis for all the CERN science although liberties are taken, and then forgotten or just not explained in terms of whatever reality the reader is occupying at the time.this one just didn't hold together like the da vinci code although the stories are good ones and not badly written this one just doesn't know when to quit. read it for a good story, explore the real science yourself. that's the most interesting part."
1,Angels & Demons Audio,"I have listened to 100's of audio book and this is the first time I have come across a narrator I will never listen to again. I only listened to 1/3 of the book because I just couldn't stand to listen to this poor reading. The part of the book itself was well written and it's to bad they were not able to get Paul Michael. He narrated the Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol - both EXCELLENT books and WELL read.Mr. Poe has a tendency to over act. LONG pauses, even when he says the chapters, it's with so much drama it wants to make me gag. I'm guessing by his voice that he is a chain smoker, because of this you can't tell when the female character and the male character are making statements.Get the book and read it, DON'T BUY THE AUDIO, unless they have it redone by Paul Michaels."
5,One of the Best Books of the Decade,"~The first book of the Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown has recieved phenominal reviews and is personally my favorite book.~As Robert Langdon a Harvard Religious Symboligist Professor recieves a strange call from an advanced European Science Reseach Center called CERN. They report a fellow scientist was murdered by the satanic cult the Illumnati (a cult missing for more than 500 years). As he discovers that the illumnati has stolen a weapon more powerful than a nuclear warhead and planted it in the Vatican, it is a race to find the stolen religion and prevent the annihlation of the Cathlic Relgion.~This book is just as addicting as the Da Vinci Code and Dan Brown is in the works of two more Robert Langdon novels taking place in London and Washington D.C.~A Must Read Book!!!"
5,Great Kindle jump start!,"this is the first book that I bought for my Amazon Kindle knowing how Dan Brown writes. this book has all the classic twists you would expect and is fantastic to read. Just like the rest of his books, I devoure this one in just a week and a half. If you need a great first book then this is the one.,"
4,This will keep you hooked!,I read this book very fast (and i am really not a fast reader)because it was very entertaining and good written. I usually dont read those typ of books at all but this one was really good and i seriously couldnt put it down.I hated it when I was riding in the train and got to me destination because i had to stop reading.I love the story and i like the fact that i have learned a little bit more about the vatican.
3,Lots of action; clever plot; but light on characters,"I enjoyed the constant roller coaster action of the story and the crafty unfolding of events and twists. But for those like me who enjoy the symbiotic power of action AND depth in a story, the deficiencies in this novel were more than minor. I felt that each character lacked the necessary depth for the reader to really sense their inner struggles. Having read three other books, ""THE BOURNE LEGACY"" (Ludlum), ""CANVAS SUNSETS NEVER FADE"" (Frieden), and ""SANDSTORM"" (Rollins) at roughly the same time, by comparison I was left somewhat disappointed by Brown's novel. Perhaps ""The De Vinci Code"" will be better."
5,FUN,"I felt as if i was there watching the plot unravel. It was not only a piece that i will read countless times, but i will have my children read it, because i feel that this book could have a significant inpact on the future of america. Because i am a kid i was able to look at how Dan Brown made it interesting to the reader by puting in details and facts to spark the imagination of someone my age."
1,I gave it 60 pages and gave up and skipped to the end,"""Hey, Vittoria!"" ""Disprove any more of Enstein's theories?"" ""The carmelango is in danger! Open the door! Hurry! But it was too late."" ""Dawn came late to Rome."" If you think this is good writing you will enjoy reading the book"
2,I've read worse,"It's not that bad, really; just phony. And very manipulative. Also, makes one think Vatican City and Rome exist for [weak] literature's sake. It features an American hero only our Harrison Ford can immortalize for the US collective psyche. One more thing: the author should urgently hire an Italian editor, because most of the Italian quoted in the book is ridiculously wrong, and occasionally plain Spanish. Kind of embarrassing for a book that wants to appear well researched in Italian culture."
3,"Pensive thriller, but...","This book is another masterpiece from Dan Brown! It's an absolute page turner, very much like The DaVinci Code. However, the climax feels like a bad hollywood movie with unbelievable events. Unlike DaVinci, the climax kind of falls apart in this book. That said, Dan Brown displays thorough knowledge of the church, right from the Pope's election process, to the Basilica's layout. At the end of the day, the book is meant to be fiction, so leave your prior knowledge and common sense aside, and I'm sure you will thoroughly enjoy this book!"
3,Good read until the bad ending!,"With Angles and Demons Dan Brown has spent Hundreds of pages of entertaining and informative fiction that spins out of control with an ending that is simply ridiculous. What a waste! Mr. Brown expends a great amount of effort cobbling together a truly wonderful nemesis-- the Illuminati-- and then burns his creation to the ground with an ending that refuses to leave well enough alone. It does not make sense? The Illuminati could have been a recurring shadow-character in scores of subsequent novels. Oh well, the author totally destroys the book in the end with his triple twist ending that left me scratching my head in disbelife. All in all a good read until the last 50 pages."
5,Awesome Plot,"I bought this book while I was reading "" Da Vinci Code"". When I finished with the code took this one and my though was that an earlier book of the ""Robert Langdon"" series will be no better the last one, but I was wrong, the reading in this book was far more supeior than the other. This is a ""cat and mouse"" run from start to finish, and your are hold in this religious plot, that holds you in the edge of your seat until the final revelation that is not even the peak of the mountain.Please is only a book for reading not for finding the errors of the author or locations that appear in the book. Reading should be fun, entertaining.If you liked the book, recomend the title to others, no spend your time in critics that make no sense, technicals details that most of the readers don't care about it."
4,I liked it better than DaVinci Code,It was very easy to read and like the DaVinci code I could not put it down.
3,No Da Vinci Code,"I heard good things about Angels and Demons, especially that it is fast paced which it definitely is. It's the book equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie (which it is now). Exclamation points, lots of cliffhangers, action and adventure. I just loved the twist of the Da Vinci code and I felt it was worthy of all the attention it received. Angels and Demons has interesting things to say about science vs. religion but the payoff isn't as good at the end. It's a good beach/vacation read though."
1,"good book, bad seller","I bought this book over a month ago and still have not received it, do not buy from this seller."
3,Galileo is my Hero and I LOVE this Book!!!!!,"The Battle of Religion and Science, will the Two ever see Eye To Eye - First there is Galileo the Father of Astronomy which is my Beloved Astrology's First Cousin. He was declared a heretic for having the audacity to declare that the earth revolves around the Sun and the Planet Jupiter has Moons. He was placed on permanent home incarceration, and his Mother spent the rest of her days in prison to assure that he behaved himself. Centuries later, his fellow scientists get revenge. It was a bit extreme - nevertheless it makes for a most interesting novel. The Powerful Vatican has a skeleton or two in their closet. Naw! How delightfully scandalous."
3,Get through the first 170 pgs...,"This book starts of very slow. It takes its time to get exciting and fun. But once it does, it really becomes a fun and smart read. Because it is such an intelligently written book, throughout the read, you feel like you are in the Vatican. This book is not as great as the world renound Da Vinci Code, but it isn't a waste of time- Similar themes, similar energy, and similar plot. If you can get through the first 170 pgs, you may really like the book.And, yes... the book's ending is quite implausible and cheesy!"
4,Good story.,"I enjoyed the story, very much. As usual, Mr. Brown brought forth some things to think about. There were a couple of points that I thought went ""over the top"" and therefore caused me to say to the writer ""Oh, come on"". I did, however, have a hard time listening to the audio version. I did not get the end of every 3rd or 4th sentence, it dropped too low. If Mr. Poe could keep from losing so much of the text it would have been much more enjoyable."
3,"Decent book, but overly twisted ending","Overall, I would say the book was good, but no where near as good as the Da Vinci Code. The book starts off and continues in a good direction. You get a good feeling of the pressing needs of the characters and the desperation of the situation. However, the endings, which I will not give away, takes some interesting and superfluous and outlandish turns that I believe is more for shock value than plot completion.I would recommend this read to someone who had loved the Da Vinci Code, but anyone who is mixed about the better first (although deemed a sequel) book, will probably be really disappointed."
2,Check your brain out before your read this!,"I gave Angels and Demons 2 stars. I bought this book after reading The Da Vinci Code. I thought The Da Vinci Code was a good read. The plot in Angels and Demons is just too unbelievable. Mr. Brown should consider adding some other people to his review committee. I can't believe the publisher thought his readers were this brain dead. This book given some revisions could have been awesome. If you buy the book, be prepared to check your brain out as the story unfolds."
1,Note to Dan.,"STOP INSULTING YOUR READERS INTELLIGENCE. With that said, I would like to say this book is the biggest bunch of garbage ever compiled in the history of mankind. Yet, so is the Davinci Code. My main problem with this book is it's so artificial like the anti-matter bomb ergh! We know right in the beginning the anti-matter bomb will go off in the end. How stupid do you think your readers are? Yes, most people love your novels and I was told at the local bookstore by an idiot to buy your other piece of garbage (D-CODE). Yes, you will be number one because your books are all about heresy. That's the main plot of your books and the reason they sell. I've warned people about your idiotic excuse for a book, but they won't listen. Hopefully, someone sees all the bad reviews and sees the thread of insulting, cliched, and waste. And realizes that were not lying."
2,Angels and Demon editors,"This book is badly edited. The Italian is often absurd and, for instance, ""camerlengo"" is constantly given as ""camerlegno."" At one point Olivetti, the commandante of the Swiss Guard claims that the ""camerlegno"" has not even been canonized yet. Huh!"
4,Decent Purchase,"While I haven't actually read the entire book yet, so far so good... I did, however, want to leave a comment/review on the product itself for any future potential buyers.In the description, it says that this book is illustrated - and that is not a joke. There are pictures on every 3 pages it seems (slight exaggeration here) and the book itself is large... like 8.5x11 large. Keep that in mind if you are trying to decide between this version of the book and the mass paperback version. I am deployed to a far away country right now and I should have bought the mass paperback version, simply because it is a challenge to lay in bed to read it... Quite honestly, it is easier to read it at a desk and then, with the size of the book & the pictures - it feels more like a text book.Anyway, for what it's worth - that is my assessment on the actual physical product - not so much the story, simply because I know I will enjoy the story as I love all of Dan Brown's works."
4,"If you like Da Vinci, you'll like Demons","The book had a pretty good story line and I thought it incorporated historical fact into fictional story telling pretty well - although not quite as well as Code does.Bottom line, it's an entertaining read, and if you like Da Vinci Code then you'll also enjoy Angels and Demons."
3,Entertaining but absurd,"Frequently, I read a book that is very entertaining, but the premise and/or parts of the plot are so absurd that the readers enjoyment is impacted. I found this to be such a book. A real page turner, on a truly interesting topic with some educational value, however, the protagonist is seemingly imbued with evil powers so overwhelming that nothing is beyond his abilities. Some truly silly moments that detract from the overall impact of the novel."
1,Unhappy reader,"This book is not well written. If I could have given it a 0-star rating, I would have. The plot is absurd - falling out of a helicopter and landing safely! It is playing on the present ""new age"" movement. The sad thing is that some people think this is nonfiction rather than fiction."
2,"Dan, You let me down","Of course we know that Dan knows how to make us turn the pages really fast and furiously. That is great. This book, like the Davinci Code, drew me in. I got quickly caught up in the characters and plot. But when an ending goes flat and array like this one did, it is in some ways all the more dissappointing. I was expecting a wonderful wrap-up to this thrilling ride. It just didn't make it at the end."
2,Excellent writing,This book was one I found at random and started reading it. It is a very detailed book that is one of the few books that you do not want to put down. I'll not give the plot away except to say that what the author told me through his book is that the ends do not justify the means.(Update)Over the years I've got a little more critical of Mr. Brown so hence the lower rating. Here's the plot for everyone of his books.1. We have a problem2. Get investigator to problem3. Investigator can't figure it out and thus consults a friend who is an expert in the area.4. Chase various lower-level bad guys around5. Find out super villian is your friend the consultant6. Minor fight scene and all ends well.
2,A simple read for the simple minded,"Basically a dumb down version of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum. Reads like it was written to be made into a teen action movie. The ""mystery"" is easily revealed within the first quarter of the book, several plot holes, stereo-type characterization. But great if you are looking for a simple read."
1,Some books are made in the end...,"... and some are broken. The book's strengths (excellent pacing for much of the first half, an astonishing level of attention to detail of art and architecture) are overpowered in the climax by a series of questionable coincidences concocted to make the implausible conclusion have any sense of narrative cohesion. This isn't Tom Clancy, where you can suspend disbelief and pretend that one man can indeed stop nuclear war if only he is on the telephone at the correct time, no, it beggars the imagination. For a book which seems impressively researched, there are errors in Catholic theology (from who is eligible to be elected Pope to the Church's rationale for celibacy) and particle physics (too numerous to mention) which could have been caught by running the text past one of the undergraduate students of the main character. Profoundly disappointing."
3,"Great Storyteller, Mediocre Writer","There is no doubt that Dan Brown is a great storyteller. This novel is fast-paced and exciting. Chock full of historical fact and mythology, he pulls off the difficult task of keeping our interest. My only complaints - and they are big ones - are the writing style and plot twists. The novel reads like a summer Hollywood blockbuster, complete with inane dialogue and implausible situations. Ultimately, I was disappointed by the lack of substance. With such grandiose themes, Brown uses cliched debates between religion and science. Such a waste of a brilliant premise. And the tidal wave of near-destruction and miraculous escapes strain credibility. Still, it is a fun read."
2,Nonsense,"Some say this is a better read than DaVinci Code, but I suggest that you save your money. This is a poorly written potboiler, full of inconsistencies, logical lapses, unnecessary verbiage, incredible happenings, unconvincing characters. It's the second and last Dan Brown novel I will read."
2,Insulting...,"As an italian writer, I'm outraged by the stereotypes about my culture and my country mr. Brown uses in his novel.He could have at least done some research: all the pseudo-italian quotations look like they've been translated with BabelFish (no offence meant to the AV translation service) and all italian family names of the characters are misspelled or non-existent.There are ZERO ""Vetra"" in the Italian national telephone directory, ""Olivetti"" is a famous national computer brand (""Nice to meet you, my name is Dell...""), and I could go on forever.Why the *#@* doesn't this guy pay an expert to check what he writes before publishing such linguistic horrors?Show some respect for our culture, mr. Brown, please.Eliver"
4,4.9 stars,"I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, LOVED this book!!!! I bought the illustrated edition because I didn't want to surf the web while I was reading to see what he was talking about."
2,more hype than substance,"With all the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code, I was expecting a lot from Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon novel. I was exceedingly disappointed. To Brown's credit, the book moves rather quickly and I didn't find myself bored at any point in the novel. That said, I felt like much of the dialogue could have been written by a cross between George Lucas and Arnold Schwartzenegger. The suspense in the book was largely contrived - the plot twists were simply the withholding of information. And the ""historical basis"" was loose (I'm being generous) and the science was worse.Angels and Demons is at times entertaining in the way of a Hollywood blockbuster. If you're not interested in thinking much, then it is worth the read. But if you are looking for anything more (character development, witty dialogue, believeable plot), then you should look elsewhere."
2,Pseudoargumentation,"I read this book on the recommendation of my granddaughter who is a practicing Wiccan. Ah! Children!I read the work after having talked with her about Mr. Brown's other masterpiece ""The Da Vinci Code"". They are similar tomes. The stories they tell are good, but the points they try to make are bogus. They both play on the idea of a Catholic church conspiracy dating back before Constantine. The ""facts"" they perport to make are either false in themselves or are used to establish a set of conclusions that ""do not compute"".I gave this book 2 stars for its story. That is probably 2 more than it deserves."
3,Factual errors,"The book was a page turner, but a couple of howling errors irked me: First, I live near Piazza Barberini, and the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria is well away from the piazza, not on it, as Brown would have readers believe. Secondly, as anyone with any understanding of the news media knows, the election of the next pope is a HUGE story, and the world's major news organizations are already booking hotel suites and hiring local staffers to get ready for it. (See Greeley's White Smoke for a fictional perspective on that.) Lastly, what's with Brown's obsession with Harris tweed?"
3,Just a little bit too much....,"This book was great during the first three quarters of the story, but after that it was all just abit too much."
3,What about the spelling?,"Brilliant page turner, but hardly a word in Italian is spelled correctly and the grammar is atrocious."
1,Poorly researched garbage,"I can't believe I read the entire thing. But with my time invested, I had to see how it ended. The plot is so outlandish that suspension of belief is impossible. Surely no one could take this book seriously. But there are all of these stellar reviews...Even if the book were a bit more plausible, there's the hackneyed writing to wade through -- hackneyed because Brown and his publisher spell out every last aspect to the story; nothing is subtle, nothing is left to the imagination. Brown either does not trust the reader, or he is simply inept. When one considers the single dimensional characters standing in for some of the sharpest persons on the globe, this reader cannot help assuming the latter.What garbage. Save yourself the trouble."
2,Clone of DaVinci code - but not in a good way,"If you read the DaVince Code and are yearning for more (as I was), you might find this book to be a let down. It starts out almost EXACTLY the same. Mr. Brilliant is awakened in the middle of the night for an urgent crisis that only he can assist with. He must board an airplane and meet with some mystery men who want to pick his giant brain. Yawn. I was shocked at how the author doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's written the same book all over again. If you want to read something that similar, you'll probably love it. I did not."
1,Trite,I am always given Dan Brown books to read by a friend or family member who loves them. I try to give them a fair chance but he is such a sorry excuse for a writer that I always end by skimming the final 3/4. Angels and Demons is yet another example. However it is so implausible that it actually elevated my opinion of The DaVinci code. The DaVinci code is bad but Angels and Demons is awful.
3,An OK Read,This book was good- not great. I read The DaVinci Code first and I found myself constantly comparing it. It was not as good as The DaVinci Code. It did keep me entertained. I would recommend it if you were desperately searching for something to read.
3,Da Vinci Code was better,"I was disappointed in this book. It was too predictable and the characters were rather lifeless. I never got a sense of what made them tick. I couldn't imagine what they looked like etc. I didn't care about them. Also, it got too far-fetched near the end.I'd give it a 2.5/5.0."
4,Great Read,"Unlike the Top Reviewer, I believe this book was great. WHO CARES that the latin was wrong. If you want to read something where everything is perfect the way you want it write your own book! The plot twists are definately neccesary, and make the book possible. As for the Mach 15 plane, BROADEN YOUR MIND. What is the point of a Sci Fi Adventure book if something in it is not possible! What do you want, something like this? ""The plane ride took 11 hours, and the connecting flight came in late. By the time he had talked to Kohler and flew to Spain, the pope and the whole of Vatican City had been demolished."" The first review is fairly pointless, and only makes sence for Latin Proffesors who double in editing. A very fun book, and an interesting ending"
3,Why resort to intellectual dishonesty,"This book is not a bad read, but I almost put it aside after a bit of intellectual dishonesty. At the outset of the book, the author sets the stage for an anti-religious sect called the Illuminati. As a part of this, he uses the the US one-dollar bill as evidence that famous Americans were related to this anti-religious group. As part of this evidence, he translated the slogan on the back of the US dollar, ""Novus ordo seclorum"" as ""New secular order""--implying an ant-religious theme. In fact, the proper translation is ""New order of the ages"". Was this intellectual dishonesty necessary in an otherwise enjoyable book? Or, does he have an agenda?"
5,Angels and Demons by Dan Brown,"The book was excellent, I could not put the book down until it was finished!"
2,Are you serious?!,"After reading the DaVinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something going for him and was suckered into reading this book. The historical and scientific accuracy he uses to beef up his plots are his only saving grace. Other than that, I have a hard time believing anything that he writes. It's fiction, I know. But I just kept having this feeling that this book would could easily turn into one of those absolutely unrealistic action movies with Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford where jumping out of an exploding helicoptor at 3000 feet without a parachute doesn't kill you. Better luck in the future, Dan!"
1,More Lemons for Dan Brown,"It just gets worse. I must have been insane but I decided after abusing my inteligence by reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" to try ""Angels & Demons"". Crap is too kind a term for this work. Not only is the style, plot and characters exactly the same as Da Vinci, but the end, its just rediciulous.Mobilis In Mobili"
5,As I write this,"As I write this, the book is listed within the top 25 selling books on Amazon. It has close to 1300 reviews. And it was written 4 years ago.My opinion will hardly change your mind.I read this after reading De Vinci, and I am glad too. Sure this takes place before De Vinci, but after the (very minor) let down of De Vinci when it came to the end, this book was the complete opposite. To the last chapter of the book, it had be stuck on it. I enjoyed this more than De Vinci, and with good reason. The book didn't get stuck on the same repeating themes that De Vinci did. This one was more entertaining, and, albeit a less believeable story, was just plain better. It isn't so much the story itself, but the way it was written. De Vinci's story was good, but it had too many repeated themes. This one was much more original as far as themes repeating, it didn't have some of the same lines over and over. So yeah, just like read it and stuff."
4,An excellent Saturday read...,"Dan Brown is a neverending source of entertainment for me and this book is a must-have prequel to DaVinci Code. The author researches his content so fully that you feel as if every word written were true. He artfully teaches you while spinning a tale that you can't take your eyes from. The only thing that has out done this book would be DaVinci Code! From one author to another, Dan Brown is easily considered one of the best!"
3,a fun book,"This is a fun book, a quick read. It gives you the feeling that you are reading something intellectual, but you really aren't. I enjoyed it, but the last sentance almost ruined the whole thing for me, 'cause it was so hackneyed."
1,I just don't understand all the fuss.,"Dan Brown is a good storyteller, but a deeply flawed writer. What he really need is a good editor. In both this and its overrated follow-up, The Da Vinci Code he telegraphs his big ""revelations"" so far in advance that the reader cannot help but be frustrated with the way he drags everything out. Get on with the story, Dan!"
3,Angels & Demons,"While I appreciated the various ""puzzles"" and plot twists throughout the book, I found a good portion of the story's twists a bit predictable. Also, a number of the events, while riveting in their delivery, weren't that believable, and might keep a reader wondering how the unspoken deux ex machina is going to save the protagonist, Robert Langdon, this time and the next. Considering some of the themes, however, it's a possibility that this was intentional.Aside from the shortcomings mentioned just above, I did enjoy the story once it kicked into full motion, and found it to be an engaging read.At this time, I haven't seen the movie."
1,REDICULOUS!,"Let's float in on the coat tails of success and take advantage of media hype and then crank out pure pulp. From page one events of an unbelieveable proportion occur. The main theme (science v. faith or science + faith) needs much more development and careful planning. The pity is that the concepts are really interesting and the history of the Illuminati is fascinating. 'Mores the pity' they were not treated in a plausable way. Who are we kidding? A huge unknown research lab in the Swiss mountains?...Our hero is contacted after a 15 minute Google search?...The dear professor is immediately included in the most top secret research?...We find ways into the Vatican's inner sanctum (AKA ""American Treasure"" ilk)?...We jump out of a helicopter and float to earth hanging onto the corners of a tarp? This should have been a comic book - excuse me - graphic novel."
4,"As good or better than ""The Da Vinci Code""","Even though I didn't think it possible that ""The Da Vinci Code"" could be matched by another Dan Brown book, I was proved wrong with ""Angels and Demons"". Like ""The Da Vinci Code"", it was full of excitment, intrigue, as well as plenty of plot twists. I just wish it hadn't been quite so long. A book like ""Darkeye"" presents an exciting tale, too, even if not as well-crafted as Dan Brown's ""Angels and Demons"", yet gets you to the exciting and unpredictable ending much faster."
5,GREAT,"I loved it ..I think what helped me to love it that much is that I started reading The davinci code first ,,for some reason I think it'd be more interesting for people to start reading davinci code before angels and demonswhen I started this book, I expected to be like davinci code , and I thought that for a while , but at the end it was very different ..I wish I like digital fortress as much as I liked those 2 books"
4,Entertaining but remember it is a fiction.,"This is a great story!! Very entertaining, a definite page-turner. Dan Brown is a fantastic story-teller but one must remember that he is a fiction writer. Fiction is loosly based on fact and is not biographical.The RC Church has for years held secrets, rituals shrouded in mystery, latin, and symbolism. He has a lot of stuff to work with... one's imagination can go wild. I urge readers to please remember that this is fiction.~FallenMoon"
2,Rather predictable,"After reading ""The da Vinci Code"", I couldn't wait until ""Angels & Demons"" arrived. However, after the first twenty pages, it became apparent that the style was the same. (Reminded me of Grisham's same old, same old!) The second disappointment came, when I figured out immediately WHO the 'bad' guy was. The rest was just getting through. Although the research was impeccable, I was not as thrilled about this book. Sorry."
3,A good fight-against-time book,"As a thriller, is thrilling enough:fast paced, enthralling and whit a good plot twist and surprise in the end. Only, I wish our Author hasn't made his protagonist so naive. Maybe an anthropologist wouldn't know of the most cryptic aspect of particle physics, but his astonishment on hearing of antimatter seems absurd in a learned man. And has he never heard of CERN and particle accelerators? As if this stereotype of the humanist scholar totally oblivious of science matters was not annoying enough, there's an extravagant overemphatization of the rift between Science and Religion.Here seems to be an unbridgeable chasm, a situation that is rather different fron reality ( see the latest pronouncement of the Pope in the matter).This said, it's a good thriller, whit carboard characters (how many post-feminism women-of-action way smartest that the male protagonist have you seen?) who don't do much in terms of human interaction,but,hey, they've got to save the world!"
5,Better than DaVinci Code,"In my opinion, Angels and Demons is a better book than the Da Vinci Code. I like the Code, but Angels and Demons kept me interested the whole time. I was so into it, I just couldn't put it down.It is apparent that Dan Brown definitely did his research on this book. These are many historical documents and artifacts that are utilized as part of the plot. If you like action thrillers, you will love this book."
2,Couldn't get on with it,"I found the book to be a bit too long and followed a kind of comic book formula of the hero getting into trouble but finding a way out of his dilemma. There were characters who may or may not be bad guys through the book and the mystery was to work out who the true bad guy was.If you like adventure books, you may like this one, although Clive Cussler does it better.Perhaps the movie will be an improvement......."
3,A thrilling adventure you can't put down!,"Meet Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconography at Harvard, awoken from his sleep and asked to fly to Switzerland. There he finds a murdered physicist with an ancient symbol burned into his chest. Could an ancient satanic cult be responsible? What happens next is an exhilarating hunt through the streets of Rome to discover the secrets of the Illuminati. The fates of the Catholic Church as well as the lives of four cardinals are at stake as Langdon crisscrosses Rome with the beautiful scientist Vittoria Vetra. Although not the most gifted writer, Brown has a talent for teasing the reader. The end of every chapter makes you want to read on and find out what happens next. Each revelation leads to others and the pay off is worth the wait."
2,More research needed,"One other reviewer cited numerous errors of language, geography, etc., but the one that really irked me concerned the physics.The supposedly brilliant physicist Vittoria wants to use antimatter as an energy source to cure the world's ills, but fails to reconginize that no matter how efficient the production of anitmatter might be made, one cannot get around Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. Even with 100% efficiency, it would still require putting as much energy into the production of antimatter as the subsequent annihilation would release.While the story is a fun read on a rainy afternoon, it was built on such a flimsy foundation that I was glad when it was over."
2,Page turner,"I will give Mr. Brown his due, this book is a page turner, after reading it however I wish I could get my 12 hours back. Calling this book immature would be an accurate critique. Don't bother reading this book."
3,Angels & Demons: A Novel,"This book is advertised as new...it appears new, but not in the greatest condition...the jacket was worn at the edges, and there are black marks on the edges of the pages...looks like it is a reject from the bookstore...still worth reading, but not useful as a ""gift""."
3,Dan Brown: Angels & Demons,"The plot was good, but a bit long-winded in some parts, it seems that the author wanted to get you a bit confused in the middle.. But the Ending was very surprising to say at least..[...]"
1,An 8 year old can write better.,"This book is rubbish,....really. The silly story is one thing, but the dumbed down writing style is just too much. I'm no great expert on novels, but I know crap writing when I read it. It really is lowest-common-denominator stuff. If you enjoy a good read, don't be fooled. this is not one. Dan Brown certainly didn't gain his fortune and fame with DVC because he is a good writer, the esoterica and arcana that he utilised to build his plot around seemed to strike a cord, however, the writing and character development is rubbish. Same here. Don't waste your money on this. Dan doesn't need it thats for sure."
1,What a terrible writer!,"I wish I could assign less than one star. I bought this because I wanted to start with the earlier books before reading the DaVinci Code. I'm assuming that the writing is much better in his later books. The triteness of his prose, the lack of continuity (where was the editor?) and his undeveloped characters with their stitled dialogues made me abandon my efforts to read the entire book. Umberto Eco he's not.Suspending belief is one thing, but you would have to suspend any expectation of good literature to read this. I have too many specific complaints to list here. Don't waste your time, even for a beach read."
4,My favorite!,"I purchased 3 pre natal yoga dvds and this one is my favorite. Rocki is a great instructor. I would not suggest this for someone who has never done Yoga before, but for intermediates it is a must have!"
3,Just okay,Love Oskri for breakfast bars but think I will not reorder this one. Personal taste preference probably but like turkish delight or the raisin pecan bars better. Sad-- but I make myself eat this one; am guessing this box will last awhile.
1,Trace Evidence by M Houck,I cannot give this book a review becausethere is not a thing written about it to allowan intelligent response.
3,Just for Fun!,This is what I would call a Just for fun book. It has scripture listed but really doesn't teach a big lesson except for that you are specially made by God. Which hopefully by now my children now this. It is a fun book for daddies to read to their little girls.
4,SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL,"This was simply delightful. Unlike most standard Regency romances, the hero, Simon Hunt is a self-made millionaire who after a chance meeting with Annabelle Peyton develops an obsession for her. He periodically sees her at society soirees where he continually suffers rejection when she refuses his offers to dance. You see, Annabelle, is only interested in a match with a peer - a commoner just won't do - no matter how wealthy and handsome he may be. And therein lies the conflict.Lisa Kleypas managed to write an absorbing story concerning the pending dissolution of the peerage and the dawning of the Industrial Age. This is the first book in a new series concerning ""the wallflowers"" - Annabelle's girlfriends who are also looking to snag titled husbands. I am waiting anxiously to see how their husband-hunting endeavors turn out!"
3,Kind of bland,"I'm glad I didn't read this book, the beginning of the Wallflower series, first otherwise, I might not have read the other three. This book is a very slow start to an otherwise entertaining series. It Happened One Autumn is good, The Devil in Winter is amazingly written and Scandal in Spring is extremely entertaining. However, as much as I didn't really enjoy Simon and Annabelle's story, I did enjoy reading about them in the following books. All in all, a good series and if you've read this one first and didn't care for it, don't let it stop you from reading the following books. They're much, much better."
3,Not a favorite,"I generally love Kleypas' books. I like her style of writing, I like the character-driven romances. But the hero and heroine in this book were a bit... flat, lacking a certain believable chemistry. I found Anabelle to be somewhat disagreeable, unlikable. A very shallow, snobby creature who seems somewhat insipid compared with Simon. His character had a depth that was lacking in Annabelle. I couldn't see why he was attracted to her in the first place, and maybe that's why I didn't like the book. The secondary characters--the other three Wallflowers and Simon's friends--were better written characters, infinitely more likeable. I'm assuming the next story will be about Lillian and Lord Westcliff, which I am looking forward to reading. But this book was somewhat unforgettable."
2,Disappointing,I love Lisa Kleypas books but this one was not up to the usual standards. I had a hard time getting into the book and it never took off. Very disappointing.
1,Very disappointing...,"First & foremost I would like to say that I totally LOVE Lisa Kleypas' previous works (Worth Any Price, Suddenly You, Dreaming of You, etc.) and she's usually at auto buy for me, which is why I was soooo disappointed in Secrets Of A Summer Night, especially since I paid full price for it! It took me almost 5 days to finish the book, (I usually finish her books in one night) & the last half I practically skimmed through. I really didn't like Annabelle, even though I tried my hardest, I thought she's exactly what the earl of Westcliff says in the book, ""shallow and selfish and self-absorbed."" In my opinion, even though Simon is a ""commoner"" and a butcher's son, he's too good for her. The only part I liked about the book was the prologue."
1,Not what I expected,"This video was very outdated. It was just Maya giving an interview but you never see the reporter and it's just her face the whole time. I thought there might have been some video montages or something that showed her life, maybe places, etc.... Not something suitable for a classroom today."
3,Could stick better,We use to cover glucose senser. It work better then another brand that we tried however it is not perfect.
5,"it is great, I'd give more stars if I could.","It's perfect, It's a Christmas gift for hardcore walking dead fan. I know he will love it. It Looks so cool, I'm going to have to get one for myself now."
1,robbed,This was a free episode and I was charged for it. Not cool.All it took was too look down the list and bam it said I had pickef certain ones to purchase but in fact I specificly only ordered 2.
4,"Good, cant wait for next season","Good, cant wait for next season. A lot of suspense, turns and twists to this season. when does season three come out for amazon?"
2,Barely Regaining Traction,"My first disappointment is that it is yet another episode spent/wasted searching for the lost girl. As a consolation, a major character expresses his exasperation with this futile and monotonous pursuit.Now for the foolishness:An unconscious character wakes in a stream-bed to find a zombie munching on his... steel-toed boot. A barn full of zombies that hitherto and inexplicably went undiscovered is revealed at the end. This is done in typical Lost (a detestable show that I quit watching after 2 seasons) and Breaking Bad (a series that turned things back around midseason) style where the episode's major revelation is left for the very last scene.All this portends to a Lost style program. A foolish program that I despised.[..]Set the hook, keep giving them mysteries, and, most importantly delay, or better yet, deny a pay off."
3,Sleepiest episode yet,"Not gonna lie....This was the was the sleepiest episode yet. Yes the writing, the acting, and continuity are all excellent as you would expect from this series...but this episode just did not have the right balance of story telling, to suspense, to action, to thrill that all the other episodes have had. I think the strength of this series is how well each episode maintains that balance. Each episode thrills, and story tells, and makes you empathize with each character. When an episode loses that balance, it loses its impact and falls to the wayside of what is more typically expected in a not so stellar TV series. Perhaps this is filler to extend the content for a longer second season? Lets hope there are not any more episodes like this one."
2,Terrible,"This is a horrible disappointment for me.I wanted to watch an excellent show in it's second season and what I got instead was a terrible show that couldn't figure out what it wanted to do with it's self.It spent most of it's time in a place that wasn't nearly as prominent in the books,and then had it's main character at the end of the season completely change.You may like this show regardless of how poorly it is done but I am not watching it any longer and am certainly not paying to watch it ever again."
5,Great,I didn't think I'd be into a series about zombies but this series is excellent. I watched season 1 in a week and immediately ordered season 2. I care about the characters and want them all to be okay and remain safe.
3,I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.,"This is the best place I suppose to rate the entire season, I promise not to give any real spoilers. Season two most certainly is much slower than season one. I'll bet over time the second season will become more appreciated. Granted, watching season two after rip roaring season one was like trying to satify yourself with a ride in a Prius after a joyride in a Corvette, but it was more entertaining than the naysayers claim. Episode one was as intense as what you find in season one, and the last three episodes are as well (especially the final one). In my personal opinion the investment of character development in season two will only add more to the series as the story continues. I don't rate it as high as season one for the simple fact that it is true that there are several episodes that are just plain boring. It's still worth a watching if you are a fan of the show or just simply like zombie flicks."
2,Not sure if this series is for me,"They are following the comics I've learned, but I wish they would have gone with the overarching plot of trying to find safe haven. Good zombie kills, though."
4,Prepare for a Cliff Hanger and Slow Progression,"Pretty good start for season 2. The plot progress is kind of slow though, lots of sluggish moments in this episode and a few random showers of drama out of no-where.WARNING: this episode has a HUGE cliff hanger at the end so you might as well wait till the second episode comes out next week and watch them back to back. Had I known the cliffhanger was going to be this big I would have waited next week. Now it's going to be on my mind till next monday."
5,Amazing,What a Great show.... It is much better to watch all at once then spread out over week to week.
4,"Walking Dead, Season II; Bloodletting",This series is a much watch. The quality on my kindle is awesome. The series itself keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for season III next week.
3,"The writers need to be fired, again.","I really want to like this show but i cant because of how stupid the characters act. From letting the kids wander around in a unsecured area, not replacing their cars and motorhome with new and reliable models since every car they come across is going to be for the taking and worst of all most of them are not even armed when outside vehicles.The writing staff needs to be fed to the zombies."
4,For people who love dead people,"Great price, timely delivery, and it is on blue ray you can not go wrong with all this working in your favor. One or two scenes are a little grainy ( not blue ray quality) but other than that it is a great series and I love that amazon was here to deliver what I wanted at a price I wanted to pay and did not make me wait two weeks to get it. I received this two days after I order it Thanks Amazon."
5,Such a great piece!!,Pricey but well worth it! This is such a great piece for any zombie lover. I keep it on the shelf in my living (dead) room all year long right next to my walking dead comics. I couldn't be more excited to have a piece of Greg Nicoteros amazing art right in my own home. I was so inspired by it I got some liquid latex and made a few of my own zombie appliances for halloween.
4,The Walking Dead Soap Too,"Okay, now I've always saw this as modern Dark Shadows meets Night Of The Living Dead and still don't feel wrongly doing so.. It is a bit soapy, but hey don't lose heart, I loved Dark Shadows (the original series). The basis of this story is for some, still unknown reason, the dead rise to eat the living and over run the bulk of us. A small town copy wakes from a coma into this world. He goes on a desperate search for his wife and son. After reuniting with his family the cast is on a nightmarish journey losing more than before. I'll leave it at that. After watching season one and two again I like it better."
1,disc freezing/disc can not be played 80029940,"The first disc plays the previews just fine, then loads the menu screen, but when you hit play all it will freeze every two or three seconds. I will write another review when I receive my exchange. I got my replacement and still can not watch it. Now it gives me error code 80029940 disc can not be played. Come on, this must be a production problem. Fix it."
2,Blah!,Do yourself a favor and skip this show and read the graphic novels! The series is still currently running and man oh man what a story it tells. I don't understand how the writers of this crap strayed so far from the books....I mean they are basically storyboards written already!
2,Perfect If You Love Zombies... And You're Deaf,"The writing is like a soap opera and filled with so many cliches. I yell at the characters constantly for being whiny stereotypes. But I LOVE zombies so I have to watch this turd of a show. I CAN'T LOOK AWAY!!! (Incidentally, the zombie stuff is AWESOME.)"
5,love this show,"how could you not love this show?! it is awesome, okay some parts a little dead, hahahahaha no pun intended...but for the most part, the action (or at least the drama) is pretty nonstop"
5,walking dead season two,Ordered this for my Grandson for Christmas. He was very excited to receive it and I was happy that both of my orders shipped together so I was able to give him both season 1 and 2 in time for birthday and Christmas.
5,Loooove this show!,I love this show and I bought these dvds as soon as I found them on Amazon. They were a good price and they were delivered right on time. It is nice to have the whole season right there.
5,Awesome,This has got to be the best TV/Cable drama I have ever seen. I am very pleased that I bought the blueray version with all the extras that come with it.
5,Can't beat it!,One of the best television series ever produced. Fantastic effects and attention to detail. I don't know any other series that so many friends and family have loved. Best zombie interpretation ever!
1,Fired the writer/producer. Now the show's unwatchable.,"First season had great dialogue, pacing and overall story.AMC fired the main showrunner and now nothing seems right about it."
5,Freakin awsome,"This is a must for walking dead fans. Yes its unforunate that anchor bay will release the special edition in a few months, but the zombie head designed by todd mcfarlane is worth it. Plus you save like 35.00$. The deleated scenes that are on the discs are kewl, and i love the extra features. Buy this if your a fan of the show."
4,A word about the song at the end....,"Love the series! Went a little slow for a couple, maybe three episodes this season, and I'm not without a few other complaints that have already been mentioned by others...but overall it's been fabulous. Luckily the show varies from the graphic novel to a pretty solid degree, so we've had some surprises along the way, and this is a good thing.On this particular episode, the song that begins to play over the closing credits really caught my ear. The band is Clutch, whom I had heard of, but was not familiar with at all. The track is called ""The Regulator"" from an album called 'Blast Tyrant'. Just picked this up today and......Wow! Outstanding stuff, especially for those who enjoy ballsy, powerful and well played hard rock with just a smidge of blues tossed in. Would highly recommend, as this Montgomery County, Maryland outfit should really be better known. Check 'em out, and here's to TWD Season Three starting up again in the fall!"
4,Great Fun,Good Sci-Fi. Worth your time and keeps your attention for the most part. Always curious to see whats coming next.
5,Crazy!,Never been into a television show as much as this one! Freaking love it! Don't miss this season. One or two!
3,Where can I get that shotgun,"How can I get Hershel's shotgun? The one that has 300 rounds? The zombie apocalypse would be a piece of cake with that. Also, how can I set a smokeless fire? That would be a great way to perpetuate insurance fraud and get sympathy at the same time."
5,Great Series,I enjoy this AMC series. I look forward to each new show on Sundays! I recommend this series. It is violent.
4,Back from the break,"While the first half of the season left me feeling unhappy with the lack of development while we continued to watch the group deal with the same issues week to week, the comeback promises new things on the horizon. The shock of events surrounding the mid-season finale seem to wake up some character that have remained static for a while and the path the group has before it now seems to open up. Not much action in this episode, but some surprising turns near the end leave me with hope for the rest of the season."
5,fantastic,"I love this show, a great plot with twists and turns in every show. I can't wait for the next season."
5,not a zombie fan,"WOW, what a great series. I am not a fan of zombie movies, but this series pulls you in, in the first episode. My daughter talked me into watching the first season, and I could not wait for season 2 to come out. Hope (not question I will) watch season 2 before season 3 comes out on October 14th. Great story. I'm in for now, but when it turns into ""Lost"" I'm out."
5,Stellar show. Shoots the lights out again.,"Season 2 ramps up alot of the actual human drama within the group. Some have said that this season is so much slower and didn't have enough action. I saw Season 2 on air and then just watched it again on DVD. I don't really find it to be particularly slow. I really liked the interaction amongst the group. It's good to see people acting like actual people, and not like they turn into super-Rambo at the drop of a hat. The DVD Extras were interesting, but i don't think there were enough. Could have replaced the piece on the schmuck who scored the background sounds with something more insightful on the past of the actors and their interaction on set. Still, an amazing follow up to Season 1."
1,Is This To Become a Soap Opera?,"There was one zombie scene which was rather short & lacking intensity, which was surrounded by the most mundane & disinteresting relationship nonsense. The sex scene wasn't even played up hot."
1,Worst episode yet,"I think that the other reviews pretty much sum up how I feel. This show isn't even about zombies any more, it's just about petty drama stitched together terribly. This used to be my favorite show, but I give up. I'm not going to make excuses for it any more. It's not going to get any better. Good job on ruining a great idea AMC. Shouldn't have fired Darabont."
2,I don't want that discusting head in my home.,"I love this show, but I don't want that discusting head in my living room. Can't you buy the season 2 special edition without the gross zombie head?????"
2,They've ruined it,"Its all been said already , agree totally with LP 'illip's review, he says it all, should not have got rid of orig dir , first season was amazing, so well done, second season is a durge, characters have become so annoying, the love triangle WHO CARES, kill em all, studio are ruining the show, turn it back to what it was before its too late, it was perfect, I don't get it, ...... idiots"
5,Horror-ific!!!,"My husband purchased this set for me for Christmas.. it is awesome, just awesome!!! I particularly liked inserting the screwdriver into the ""walker's"" eyeball ;) He has a special place on my mantle and is quite a conversation piece. A MUST for any Walking Dead fan, this was by far my favorite gift of the year!!"
4,The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season,I like it . Though the first disk has some issues before it starts with the first episode. Other then that it's in good shape.
2,Sound Problems,Very disappointed. Loaded this Blu Ray into my Pioneer Elite player and the sound is garbled. Unable to resolve the issue so far after updating the firmware. Thecomedy is amplified inasmuch as this movie plays fine on my scimpy little PS3
5,Loved it,"I am already a regular Amazon customer, and when I found out that they had ""The Walking Dead"" I got into Amazon more. I Love this product, the quality of the videos is amazing and the fact that Amazon checks for the internet connection to enhance your viewing experience is great. Not all other companies like Netfilx and others do that. The video selection is useful and simple. No need for complicated options, just click on the episode and it starts. Love the auto-play function and the episodes get better as the season goes by. Would love to see a scene selection option or a subtitles or audio option. Besides that the product is great, no need to look anywhere else for this product. Amazon gives you top quality for your money. I highly recommend this product."
5,Great TV Show!,Season 2 is just as good as Seaon 1! Lots of action and full of surprises! Season 2 doesn't disappoint.
5,Walking dead season 2,"Awesome !!! I received the shipment in a week, the price was just right, now I'm going to order season3 , yeah!!!!!"
1,leftist trash,"this show had a good thing going...and then they tried to paint southerners as racist republicans and lost their dignity and potential. a sad turn in season 2, but luckily it happened early enough in the season that it's hard to care what happens in the future. evil destroys itself."
5,Great Show!,"This is an amazing series. I would never have guessed that a series about zombies would be so successful, but you must see this show."
5,Awesome show,"I am addicted to this show. I thought I'd try and watch ""The Walking Dead"" since I kept hearing so many great things about it. It's soo good!"
1,in the event of my death,I didn't like it. I found it impossible to get into and finally gave up after 60+ pages.
1,Cannot recommend this book,"I purchased this book after reading the other reviews, and was extremely disappointed. The characters seemed so silly I really didn't care which of them got murdered. I managed to read about half of it, then skipped to the last chapter only because I spent $8.65 and felt I should at least see how it ended."
1,a short shelf life,"Ultravox is like that container of cottage cheese on the dairy shelf at your favorite supermarket. It tastes great for a time until it reaches the expiration date and then you just have to throw it out. I enjoyed this and many other recordings of the Midge Ure-era when they were new and fresh, but listening to them now makes me wonder if they sounded dated and hopelessly out of place even before the decade of the 80's came to its final conclusion. This music came out at a time of great excess and a live for the moment attitude. Few bands in my mind have been able to trancend this highly disposable era and unfortunately, Ultravox is not one of them. Is there a foul odor emanating from your CD/record collection?"
3,Horrible..Just Horrible,Ok..I Have Been A Big Fan Of Mayhem Since 1987 And I Have To Say That This Is The Worst Record By Them Out Of All Of Them...BRiNG MANIAC BACK! Atilla Is Just Screaming With No Feeling And The The Guitarwork Is Just Whacked And Not What Youd Expect Out Of These Legends...Always Remember The Glory Days Of Mayhem With Dead Up To Maniac...Atilla Is Not What This Band Needs ..Hellhammer..>Cmon Brother You Can Find Better In A Vocalist
1,Yikes....,"I just got my tickets today to see them live next month and I didn't have this release yet...I know, I'm late. I have all of there stuff on cd and it's pretty good, different style of blackness but Ordo Ad Chao sounds so bad I'm taking it back. Real bad. I hope the live showing is better...???"
5,Season Two Twice as Good!,The title says it all... If you're into watching people (Ali G) make fools of other people (everyone else) than you will absolutely LOVE this DVD!
1,Eh,"Let me start off by saying that these rear upper links look great. That's about it for the positives.The pieces that that house the screws at the ends, constently strip and come off. I've replaces them numerous times with them stripping each time. It seems like the thread on the blue aluminum is to small for it to have a decent grip.Look some where else."
4,Good but abit short.,"Small book but worth it's price.Very good exercises building up in difficulty gradually.The exercises also are set up in a way that you need to focus and you memorize everything faster.Hiragana has a lot to do, just wished the Katakana part well as complete also (they got a lot less exercises)."
3,"Nice watch, But",Wore the watch for about a week and the strap slide broke. Glued it back together but did not last long. Nice sturdy accurate watch and strap. Just wish it had a solid strap slide.
2,Not Quite a Classic....,"This is billed as part of the Christmas Classic series. In truth it should be billed as the Christmas forgettable series. This is one of those humdrum, mundage animated Christmas specials that fail to capture even a tiny bit of the magic of some of the true classics like Rudolph or Frosty. Voices are provided by Travis Tritt, Nell Carter, and John Forsythe. It's a sappy story about how three orphans in the town Harmony look to give the the people of the town a gift and basically come up with Christmas Carols. It's a pretty weak premise to begin with and when you couple it with weak animation, and an annoying theme songs that plays over and over, this one adds up to a very forgettable holiday chunk of coal."
3,The Kite Rider,This story is about a 12 year old boy named Haoyou and his relatives who live in China in the 13th century.After the death of of his father occurs Haoyou's mother and sister find themselves at the mercy of his uncle.Haoyou's uncle really only cares about gambling more than his family. Soon Haoyou's mother has no other choice than to marry his uncle. Later on Haoyou and his cousin Mipeng join the circus Haoyou sets his job as a kite rider. During his career as a kite rider Haoyou's attitude begins to change questioning beliefs. Haoyou's life is about to change as he performs in front of Kublai Khan. He didn't know this would be his last performance.Haoyou was later beaten up by a mongolian boy. Hoayou had been left alone until returnig home to his mother.By:JT LanierMs.D
4,How To Shoot a Glock - review,"Interesting video for the real beginner like me.Good but short explanation of basic skills (stance, grip, sights,...).I would recommend this video to the real beginner, it's a good way to start and to get into the ""mode"" of shooting with a Glock."
3,"Good CD, Can Be Better","I'm a Daft Punk fan, like other people. When I first bought the CD, I thought it would be remixes from both ""Homework"" and ""Discovery"". Boy, was I wrong! It repeats themselves after Track 2. Most of the songs (such as Aerodynamic, Digital Love, and Harder, Faster, Better, Stronger) are from ""Discovery"", while only one song, (Phoenix) is from ""Homework"". And the Enhanced CD sucks! It just has the cover on ""Discovery"" on there, and it takes you on the website for their mailing list for Action Figures from the anime movie, Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk, love your music, but next time you want to do a remix album, please include ""Homework"" Tracks!"
2,weak,"this is not a very good catch 22 cd. the first 2 songs are ok, but catch 22 are capable of better songs. These songs on here would have been great for another band, but catch 22 can do better. The live songs sound like they would have been good, but the quality is terrible. there isn't much going on in these songs, just get keasbey nights."
1,Where's the ska?,"When did Catch-22 turn into a skacore band? This is pathetic. The double-bass too-fast drums don't fit into any of the songs, which all seem to sound the same. Even the live tracks of classic songs from keasbey nights lack the old luster. Save your money. Get Keasbey Nights and/or Alone in a crowd"
3,No Guitar Tab,"This book/cd has a very nice selection of Bossa Nova tunes and is well-produced. That being said, it is worthless to me without the guitar tab.Guitar Player magazine once had a poll in which it found that 67% of guitarists don't read music, and I am one of them.If you read music, then I can recommend this product. If you're a tab-only guy like myself, then you need to pass."
1,dangerous,"This Hamilton Beach product is dangerous and should be recalled! The blade release button is right where you need to put your thumb while carving. As I was slicing, my thumb mistakenly hit the release button and the live blades went flying across the counter. Bad design. Took it back."
2,Not crazy about it,This knife would be great if the power button wasn't on the bottom of the knife and the blade release on the top. It's awkward to use because you have to hold it kinda weird so you don't release the blades at the same time you're running it.
1,Don't make me laugh,This product would be laughable if it didn't cost something. Don't attempt to slice/cut/carve anything more than melted butter or the knife motor will strip and become useless. This happened the first time I used it. Don't waste your money on this product!!! Order a Cuisinart product--it will last at least six months before it dies.
3,NIce blanket,"Very large, which I guess is a good thing. Very nice olor. Medium soft, good medium weight-- will work through the fall. A good 3 season blanket. Medium tight weave-- a little looser than expected. I don't think the original price is what it was worth. With the discount, it's a good buy."
1,Not a 90 degree angle,More like 91-92 degrees which makes this pretty much worthless. This is just a cheap casting and they don't even bother to machine it square afterwards.
5,An interesting personal history,"I really enjoy Frank Rich's columns. This book tells you all about his childhood which was quite sad, in an upper-middle class sort of way."
4,Frank Rich graces the theatre world once again.,"This is a must read for any ACTOR. The normal audience member will not enjoy the many humourous and quirky things that only an actor can understand. Actors of all backgrounds and levels will enjoy the insight that Frank afforded the theatre community. Yes, it can ramble, but like any review in the NY Times, read what you want to. Buy it, read it, and become a better actor."
5,Machu Picchu: A Civil Engineering Marvel,"Fascinating book for anyone who has ever wondered how such a place could have existed in such a lovely, remote location. This book will satisfy the queries of an engineer and will answer every tourist or would be tourist's question ""How did they do that?""Superbly written and understandable for anyone; not written as an engineering report but for anyone of any age.I must commend those who spent the months of work ferreting out the details of the lost city to find how it was able to service its residents.I am going to gift this book to several school libraries."
4,The best Humble Pie Album,"Quite a lot has been said already, and I agree with it wholeheartedly.Humble Pie never made a ""brilliant"" album but they were just a fantastic live band. Having seen the four times and bought every album they made, one of my musical disappointments ( along with missing Stevie Ray Vaughn live ) is that I do not have a real memory of those concerts... Hammersmith, Rainbow, Newcastle .....However, as an album of excellent music, and one track ""Beckton dumps"" which is just pure Steve Mariott .... this is as good as it gets.Hope you are still spitting up there, Steve !!! You are one of the few people who gave it 100% every second ...."
1,"""North"" is a miss","This is by far the worst of Rob Reiner's films. The actor playing the main character never connects with the audience for even a moment, and the entire film depends on that sympathetic connection. This movie is not worth seeing."
5,a different generation of poetry,"The Wife of Winter by Michael Dennis Browne follows the times of the 1970's. This was a different age for poetry. I like that Garrison Keillor is keeping verse like this alive by featuring it on his show.Dennis continues to write excellent verse, but we can also learn from the older stuff too."
3,A Collector's Piece,"There is a reason that most SM fans buy all of his efforts. He was a genius at mixing beat and melody. The problem is that economics pushed the popularity of the collective group to do things, I believe, even Mendes might wished he had not. This CD, while a collector's must have, it is not a random listener's best choice.This is more like disco meets Ipanema. Like the efforts of Percy Faith or the Boston Pops meet Jobim..it sounds ok but it just does not have the purity that Mendes is capable of. Listen to his Brasiliero or even the original Brazil 66 classic and you'll see what I mean. Better than this one is the Vintage cd..and that one is a lot more solid in effort and purity."
5,Soooo adorable,"Ok, I have these adorable Littlest Pet Shop toy's and I love them I have 41 about to get 8 more for my birthday and LOADS for Christmas my favorite holiday anyways..... These adorable animals come with a durable teeter-totter and are so cute if you pull on the bass holding the teeter-totter together it will come off but that does NOT ruin the toy I higly reccomend this toy for ages 4-15!"
4,"Think Empire, not the ribald Maddy of merrie olde England","Softer, grander, sweeter, more Empire, less May Pole than my favorites by her. This CD reminds me that Prior glories in England's glory; it plays up the Empire end of this glory. The Prior I prefer plays up the Childe ballads and ribald songs of merrie olde Englande. Not Maddy's best in my book, but still good. Evokes Judy Collins in her better days, other high-quality folk-pop fems. Stand-outs: tr 6-Commit the crime (pop, female anthem; quintessential Prior, at her peak); tr 10-Face to face (pop, female anthem; quintessential Prior, at her peak); tr 14-The sovereign prince (takes glory of Empire over the top); tr 18-Allellujah (simple grace) [67:15]"
5,Read this book!,"If you are having back problems, read this book. I read an earlier edition a long time ago and have followed the recommended exercises ever since. The result: very few episodes of serious back pain in 16 years. Maggie was one of the first people to publicize the importance of exercise for dealing with and preventing back pain."
2,A blast from the 80's,"This pen is as sophisticated as some early 1980's free giveaway electronics - which really does not mount to very much.There are 4 short Darth Vader sentences recorded that can be played back by pushing the buttons on the side of the pen. The sound quality so low and one can barely tell what Darth Vader is saying. The oversized Vader head at the end of the pen (which makes it almost unusable as a pen to write with) maybe the best part of the whole toy: it makes a good Vader character on-the-go for with the little bonus sound FX.It's really a useless as a pen, but makes a fun toy for a young Star Wars fan...the fun factor fades quickly and don't expect this one to last very long!"
4,Works. Good quality except...,"This product works. Requires screwing GPD onto GPS mount but includes a knob for GPS if you lost the original. Good quality/fit, only negative, can't use powercord with GPS mount... I ended up cutting a hole for AC/DC adapter. Easy to mount/remove GPS from Bicycle mount."
1,Do you love Arizona?,"I bought this tape to show my family how lovely is the state of Arizona; I just accepted a job in Tucson. What a dissapointment! The tape is long and boring. There are many minutes of pictures shown without any verbal comments, just an awful music going on and on. There is very little information on the history of the state and the lives of people who are there now. In conclusion, it looks to me that this tape was made in one day by a drive-by tourist. I am returning it."
2,Arizona,The seller of this product sends out your purchase right away and you have it within 4 days. The video itself seems to be a vacation video Not Sellers Fault. If you enjoy vacation videos then you would like this one. I will purchase another video from this seller but not another vacation type.
1,Not worth a dime.,I regret to say that this dvd on rifle shooting stinks. It is way out of date. It is for children and the simplest beginners who have not the least understanding of rifle shooting. It was a great disappointment. It was definitely a waste of money.
1,I don't know how the dvd is- it never arrived,I don't know how the dvd is- it never arrivedand dvdmagnets refused to refund me the money... beware!Tamar G.
5,This book is a hoot!,"I sent it to older aunts last Christmas so they would have a good laugh. The story is very funny. I haven't read The Blue Castle, but I guess it is too, if the two stories are similar. Long live hilarity. If you read excerpts from each book, they read very differently. ""Blue Castle"" is coconut cream pie! ""Ladies of Missalonghi"" is barbeque!"
2,Reba fan,"As Reba materials go, this is one of her not so best works. I love the works of Martina and Trish's music is OK. However, neither one for these CDs stand out as good music. I suggest purchasing albums form artists you want with the songs you want. Each CD has 2 great songs mixed with background noise-type songs."
5,A tale how Number 5 got to be alive!!!!,This is Coco's story. How she came from poverty and became what she became. There was much jealousey around her and many people did not want any part of her to have any respect let alone glory. It is also a story of love she had for a man and what happened there. This tale shows her life was not always as sweet as her perfume.Worth watching.
3,Good if your interested in Chanel,"I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who is really into anything about Chanel and the fashion industry. She enjoyed it, I thought it was a little long."
2,Dissapointing,"As a fashion history buff, this movie dissapoints. It wallows too much in the love story between Coco and Etienne, then the years 1912-1914 when Coco made hats. Her real breakthrough was in the WW1 years, but the movie almost skips this period altogether. The acting is mostly bad... with the (french) voices sounding stiff and funny.Also, the older Coco`s (Shirley Maclaine) comment that ""I have no one to thank but myself for my success"" is uncredible when the movie quite clearly shows her accepting a lot of grants from her lover Boy to finance her early career.""Chanel solitaire"" from 1981 still stands as the major movie about Coco Chanel. Let`s see what ""Coco avant chanel"" brings when it opens this late summer."
3,Left Ankle Squeeze,"The boots were attractive and materials used were good. The color was a dark chocolate. The boots wedge heels were dressy and the slouch was even in each boot. However, the problem was with the left boot. Though both boots were narrow in the ankle area, the left boot was tighter in the ankle than the right and it pinched the top of my leg when I walked. I have small ankles and they should have fit ok. I sent them back. Other than this one problem, the boots were true to size."
5,Beautiful...simply beautiful,"I purchased this CD a couple of weeks ago and just can't stop listening to it. Each track is simply magnficent. The ""lyric book"" is actually a graphic novel done by the band's own Zachary Johnson, which helps explain the album is much better detail. Essentially what you're listening to is a story (and a tragic one at that), about love, work, and living.The album raises one of the most important questions of all: What is more important: taking a chance and love and life or finding security in the mundane life you're living now?Truly inspiring."
2,XLmeans Medium!,"This shirt is adorable...on a Barbie! I am a huge Red Sox fan, but I'm a woman. So when I buy an XL from the misses dept it fits great. Yes, I am a big girl, but that doesn't mean I want to give up my style and wear a men's large. We all know their t-shirts' cut are not as flattering on us. I just want to represent Red Sox Nation with some cute clothes, but this shirt-- like others I keep coming across --is so tiny and sized for the junior dept. So disappointing!"
5,"If Frosted Flakes are grrrrrreat, this is so much better","I live in North Carolina and catch and keep a lot of Invertebrates we we go to the beach. So far, every Invert that we've caught has been in this book, easy to find and we found out alot about it by reading. Anyone who sees something cool at the beach often should get this book. In fact, it's a Must-Have.Shredda Out"
2,this father isn't a hero,"This book is poorly plotted: the entire book takes place in about 6 months, and both Gina & Harry & Marty all find the new loves of their lives? And how does the Irish tv personality win an award when he can't have been on the air more than 2 months?Plot inconsistencies drive me crazy--coupled with this farce of a man, who thinks being a father is heroic, this book is plain old ridiculous. The relationships between Harry & his father and son seemed the most real--but every other relationship felt false. It felt like the author had no idea how OTHER relationships work."
4,Best of Parsons,"Out of Man and Wife & One for My Baby, Man and Boy was my favorite. I found it a completely engrossing and bittersweet picture of one man's complicated life and the love he has for his boy. A must-read."
3,Nice,"I probably had a high expectation due to the rave reviews this book gets. Well, it has a nice story, with interesting expressions of what's going on in the main character's mind. But that's it."
5,The master works his magic,Once again William Gibson creates a book that leaves one pining for more. Pattern Recognition is a novel that exemplifies his ability to provide a vision of scenes and characters that are thoroughly detailed yet without the wordiness of a David Foster Wallace. A great example of this is his description of Cayce getting dressed for her meeting. In a few quick sentences the reader comes to understand not only what Cayce is wearing but what she is all about.Some of the commercial and trade reviews that I have read have compared this book very favorably with Neuromancer and I concur that it is an extremely well thought-out and written book. But what they didn't say is that it is that it is an extremely different book. Those of you who are seeking another cyberpunk book rather than looking for good fiction written by a master are going to be left wanting. Cayce is definitely not Case and lives in a very different world.
3,Enjoyable but underwhelming,"This book is by no means bad. It doesn't drag along and you never feel the need to shelf it before you are done.My main problem with it it that after a great buildup, the payoff was underwhelming. I found myself thinking: ""surely this is not it? Is there a sencond part to it?""It was a nice trip, however, even if the destination was not what I expected."
5,"Pattern Recognition, great book","In general I like good sci fi that's fairly thoughtful. This Gibson is not his typical sci fi, but it's a great mystery/thriller with sci fi elements. The main character is one of the best written characters I've read in quite a while. And it's very current. It has some of the best commentary on 9/11 that I've ever read. And I believe the first time I've seen 9/11 incorporated into fiction.Good book. It was one of those that I looked forward to reading every night and often stayed up too late finishing just one more chapter.C'est tout."
2,Boring,"This is now my fourth Gibson novel. Having very much enjoyed two previous, (the classic Neuromancer. . . a must read, and Count Zero, also very engaging) and being disappointed by Idoru, I figured I'd check out this newish novel.I slogged through this book, ever hoping for some action, of which there was little to none. Yes, its an interesting commentary about the world of consumerism, and the research into antique calculators is neat, but the interest ends there. Mr. Gibson spends far too much time discussing clothing fashion rather than the overall ""man vs. man"" theme. In the end, I was just happy to have finished. Skip this book and read one of the aforementioned greats."
1,One of the worst sc-fi novels I've ever read,"Starts out bad and it just gets worse. Boring, unintelligent, incoherent, pointless, peurile. Mind numbing, and not in a good way. How can I draw an analogy? Hmmmm. OK, imagine the most idiotic, uninspiring, self-important piece of trashy modern art. The kind where you look around to see if there are hidden cameras and this is just some kind of joke. Now imagine it . . . as a book. This book is it.I literally threw it in the trash. I've thrown a grand total of two (TWO) books in the trash my whole life.Do yourself a favor and read some smart, thought provoking work from Neal Stephenson, not this."
3,Pattern recognition,I gave this company a bad review when the problem with the address was my fault. I would like to apologize and take back what I said.
2,A retro-disappointment,"This is the first book I read by William Gibson and I thought it was entertaining, gripping, but light. And disappointingly not science fiction in any possible use of the term. Then I read Neuromancer, which as advertised is a great creative prediction of a cyberworld that doesn't entirely hang together but is immensely enjoyable. Pattern Recognition, set beside Neuromancer, is a fine airport book."
3,Merely good,"Mr. Gibson is an excellent observer of culture and paints a fascinating future. Plotting and characterization are very good, and he can turn a phrase. However, the novel ends on a whimper, without much of a payoff."
3,Not quite enough,"Not having read any other of William Gibson's books I've no benchmark to compare it to. With that said, Mr. Gibson's writing style is a pleasure - his sentences have a staccato poetic rhythm that keep the story moving at a nice clip.What bothered me about this book was that the villains weren't sinister enough and the pay back for their misdeeds lacking the proper retribution.People's motives didn't seem fully developed or explored and the ending was a bit too tidy.All in all, a good read."
1,A Waste of Time,"Other than having the phrase ""He took a duck in the face at 250 knots"" being repeated more times than I want to think about, there was nothing else even remotely interesting in this book.A much better book about computers and such is ""Digital Fortress"""
1,Total failure,"The product did not work. 20 words? I got taken for a ride by a product that did not work. Exclamation point. Total failure. What more can I say? I tried, and I tried, and I tried and I got no satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction."
1,bad product. could not return.,"This battery did not work in my cell phone. When I went to the website to return it, I read that I cannot return a ""hazardous product"" so I'm out the money for the battery, stuck with disposing of it properly and still didn't have a battery for my phone."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I have purchased Rand McNally Atlases for many years now, so this year I thought I'd treat myself with the deluxe edition. I have been very disappointed, especially with the spirals getting in the way so it is almost impossible to travel in an area where the spirals come into play. I can't recommend this to anyone. A regular paperbound copy is much better and costs less."
5,Very happy,Love this DVD and the price was amazing! Have already ordered 3 more and planning on purchasing the entire collection!
1,Pungent smell of toxic toy,This toy is a very unpleasant odor.This is not a let baby bite of toys.Fisher Price&#65292; I am very disappointed!
3,not foolproof,"My daugher's dentist put some of this on her nail in the hopes that it would be too bitter to bear. It seemed to work which was good since this was a last resort. (The plastic thumb guard only lasted while she was asleep, but as soon as it came off, the thumb was back in the mouth.) However, the next time we tried it, she still sucked her thumb, claiming it didn't taste bad enough to deter her from sucking her thumb! Whatever."
1,Very Harmful!!,"This product is very harmful ! As a parent I am very ashamed that I resulted in using this product for my child. It made her very sick. Please read the label before purchasing, it should be banned from shelves."
5,OMG IT WORKED!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! My Husband had been biting his nails for 20 years. He would bite them till they became nubs and Bled. After one Single use he stopped biting them. His Nails are now Growing beautifully. I already recommended this product to everyone i know. AWESOME PRODUCTTTTTTTTTT!
3,Ok product,It's an ok product but didn't really work. At first my son didn't bite his nails because he knew the stuff was on there and was told that it would taste really bad but eventually he bit them anyway and said the taste wasn't that bad.
3,Its just okay,"I apply it daily to my 4 year old child's finger nails. He has been using it for about 2 weeks. I think it has slowed down his nail biting but I do not think it has stopped it. So far I am not really sure whether it is really working or not. I bought this product thinking it would be in instant fix. I thought that has long as he had the nail polish on it would taste so bad he would not bite, but he still does. I am going to keep using it on him and if he does not stop in a week or two I am going to switch to another brand."
3,taste not strong enough,"My nine year old did not stop sucking her thumb after using this for a period of time , she said it did not taste that bad any more"
5,Rippin Rocket Great,This was a great purchase. The set was complete and I had a lot of fun building it. I would recommend it to any builder regardless of age.
3,A book just for Jackie fans,"I don't think anyone else would ""get it"". But Jackie followers will like it. This book actually had little tidbits I hadn't heard before (didn't think it was possible!). Some new source must have blabbed. It certainly presents Janet in a kinder light - and Black Jack Bouvier is looked at more critically (zero IQ - really!!). Buy it, Jackie lovers - you'll get your moneys' worth."
3,Light on Contents,"The concept of the book is excellent. The presentation is also very good. But it is pretty lightweight. It does not have enough contents to serve as a reference, nor do I think, after paging through this book, that was what the author had in mind.I have several books I stuff in the car for light reading while I am waiting for people or traffic. This book belongs there."
1,If you have money spend is on something else,"Obviously there are classics and the must have's. This one is neither. You will be rather misinformed if you will think that by cutting out essential information essence will not be lost in a Samskritam. You will do better as to spend it on a larger volume, unless that what you do... want to learn less"
5,"""lost"" gems","It's a shame that most of Comyns is out of print (at least here in the US). Her novels are strange, haunting, quirky, beautiful and worth every effort to track down in used bookstores or online. The Juniper Tree is no exception. Please, readers, find these books!"
5,Totally Broke and Totally Fabulous,"I think that any college student or graduate that has been truly broke can relate to Angela Nissel's story. What I admired most about her is that she never let the situation get her down and stayed focused on her goal of graduating.I've read some reader reviews that wondered why she didn't work more or get an extra job in addition to her work study gig. Well they have obviously not attended an expensive private school. You need to study to graduate and she stayed focused on her goal.I remember washing clothes by hand and having just a few items in my day. I was never as broke as Angela (I lived in the dorm and had a meal plan), but had some friends who were putting themselves through school and were. Everybody knows what they can hadle to make it academically and she was willing to sacrafice. As a person with two MA's I can appreciate that! I think anyone who has ever been broke should read this book."
3,De LaUnaBella,"I noticed that it was featured on the Montel Williams Show, along with a guest appearance by the author. I liked what the book offered me in terms of triggering memories of my own ""broke"" days in college and graduate school, but it wasn't as humorous as I'd expected it to be at all. It was boring and some of the entries were a little far fetched for my taste."
1,Give me a break,"This book is the story of a college student who does not know how to manage money. I found that the situations she encountered were her own damn fault. They could have been avoided by using common sense. For example, the part where she overdraws her debit card making phone calls in a train station and then gets angry when she discovers she has a chex systems record! Give me a break."
4,"Funny, Enjoyable Read!","I think one of the things I liked best about this book is the way Ang talks when someone pisses her off. Well, she says ""effin"" a lot, but I like the traces of her Philly dialect. It cracked me up. I was really glad that she decided not to shoplift. She's got ethics, and won't stoop to certain levels. My favorite scene was when she nailed the guy for being a college ""faker."" Could have been edited a little better, but it was a fun, fast read nonetheless."
1,HUGE waste of money,"We have been feeding this supplement to our five dogs for about four months now with no benefit to any of them. Our Staffordshire Terrier was highly allergic to the supplement and had to immediately be taken off it. Our Lab/AmStaff mix has arthritis in her knees and we had hoped this might help her a bit, but she has not shown any improvement. Our Australian Cattle Dog mix has a coarse coat and sheds heavily, but this didn't help that problem either. We've tried feeding it to our horses, but neither of them will touch the stuff no matter what I mix it with. This product has been a HUGE, HUGE waste of money!"
2,Too many broken cookies,"These cookies arrived with many of them broken into a number of small pieces. They can ship cookies to stores without this happening, so why does it happen here? The cookies taste good, but a little too sweet for me. Overall they are OK---but just wish they wouldn't arrive so smashed."
1,Novice only...DVD is just an advertising gimmick,Very dissappointed in this product. Save your money. This DVD is really an advertising piece by Mr. Wilson for his lubrication products. Information tossed in on the 1911 is there to keep if from being a total crass ad gimmick. Too bad Mr. Wilson chose this and not a useful approach to the 1911. If you are totally and completely unfamilar with field stripping a 1911 ask your local gunshop owner and save your money.
1,"Great title, but...","What an awful release. This is clearly Valor at his worst (although I still haven't heard ""All the Hate"" yet, so maybe not). Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally anti Valor-I thought ""Atrocities"" was an incredible effort-but this is an album that should be avoided at all costs. Period. I wish I could give it a zero!"
5,Great Scanner,"I've used this scanner on both '98 and ME. It works great. I never had any problems with it. It scans nice, and it has a preview before the actual scan to allow one to make specific choices for that particular scan."
4,Fun 'fidget',"I really like toys I can just plain fiddle with. While there are certainly some educational elements and puzzle elements to this toy, I think the thing that is most fun about it is just the Zen of working it back and forth into different configurations."
5,Have had it for almost 20 years,"I have had my Rubik's twist almost 20 years and it still works great! My 4 year old had decided to keep it with her toys and plays with it all the time. In fact, everyone plays with it. My only downside is that I am the only one here who can put it back into a ball and everyone wants to learn that."
1,"Great toy concept, poor quality","My son has been wanting this for a long time so finally got it for Xmas. He played with it for less than 1/2 hr before a section broke. He didn't twist hard or rough as I watched him when it broke. He was so disappointed. Had I read the reviews before purchasing, I might have thought twice before buying. He enjoyed making all kinds of shapes, until it broke."
1,Review,I thought this was very poor quality and a lot smaller than the snake I has as a kid . Some parts move very loosely and it feels like it will break. I'm not happy at all.
4,loved it,"i loved this toy as a kid, and my son loves it now. came as ordered when ordered, no problems at all"
2,""" Like eatin' spaghetti with nuttin' on it ! ""","After reading Badlands , Goldfield and Sierra, and becoming quite a fan of Richard Wheeler, this latest work was dull to say the least.Second Lives left me feeling hollow and found it difficult to get through the unimpressive and boring storyline given. I had no connection to the misplaced characters."
1,awful just awful,i took this back to the record store and got my money back. it is the worst album i have ever heard. retire tony. you lost your voice.
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!,"I liked the first hills have eyes back in 80s, and the RE-make!But wow this part2, Was sooo bad & awful, I wants to just break the DVD & i'm glad didnt buy this junk! The story and scrip real bad, Cast & acting was the worst of all , bunch a silly & lame group, call themselves ""National Guard trainees"" with they lame jokes & act, F this and F that, With that short & chubby Mexican dude,speaking some spanish ? HUH? Screaming & crying try soo hard to act & didnt worked! The scrip was soo awful, just lost interest. this #2 S*CKED BIG TIME even in box-office! So go figure, Shame on u wes craven, with this lame trash worth! D SKIP THIS JUNK!!!!"
3,Middle of the road horror movie,"I personally like this movie, but I can see where some people have a hard time with it. The mutants are good and the gore is good, but yes the story is a bit weak, with some really bad acting to boot. This is one of those movies you either love or hate."
4,The hills have eyes 2,"This is a good horror/thriller that was a few graphic violence and gore that will aleast waste a hour and a half of your day.This is a little like the first one ,but to me it's better because it get'ts right to the point ,the first one took about and hour to get to the mindless horror which is what these movies are about,but i still had some problems with this one: first thing is the rape seen it didnt fit to me ,it should of just implied it,another thing that bothered me was how u dont get to know our heroes names until they need help and another person helps them ,and it should have been a little longer aleast in the caves.Aleast give it a rent!"
1,"Remake of part 1 was much, much better!","Some ""sort-of-spoilers"" are in this review. NOTHING MAJOR! I remember sitting in the theatre thinking how this should have been ""straight to video"". Some moments were so stupid. Someone submerged in a toilet (yes, under the rancid, filthy water)happens to be alive? Toward the end, I could not wait for this movie to end. They tried at the end for cheap thrills, like ""hanging body parts"", but when there is nothing to be thrilled about what's the point? Like when they show moments of rats running along the floor, or cockroaches running along the floor, and it's supposed to add ""suspense/thrills"" and it really adds nothing but wasted movie minutes(SEE..SEE NO EVIL)."
2,Not that interesting,"What can I say about a film of a hapless National Guard unit that gets cut to ribbons my inbred cave-dwellers? It's a battle between two groups of dim-wits. It promised some sleaze in that the inbreds need new women to breed with, but they cut the throat of the woman who gives birth. Way to go!"
1,kwik kick,"the plastic snap that holds the straps is very weak, afer a small amount of dribbling practice the snap cracked then broke."
4,Wish I could have given it 5 stars.,"I just finished reading this book. I found myself looking forward to reading a chapter each night. I thought her ideas were right on biblically and helpful. I especially found out myself that without goals, you will get depressed. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt that some of the information wasn't needed in this particular book. This book is for people who have depression. I didn't mind the short chapter on ""Living with someone who is depressed"", but then there was an extremely long chapter on how to counsel a depressed person. I began to get a little bored there. The chapter on how to counsel a depressed person to me just didn't make sense to me. I am depressed, how can I counsel a depressed person. ?? I read it anyways and did gain a little insight as to how counselers work. Overall it was a good book, I just thought the first half was the best."
1,Not useful,"This book is basically useless. It has a few sets of baseless ""best of"" lists, which don't really reflect anything. The book ""Guide to Architecture Schools"" doesn't rank the schools, but has much more comprehensive information. This book is also extremely short, and way too expensive even at $25."
1,Was sent the Wrong Pair,"I am sure I would love these shoes, but I can't really say for sure because the company sent me anotyher shoe in black, size 8 Triple E width. Consequently, I went in to exchange them and when I tried, they said out of stock, so now I am ska-rooed. Soo, I guess I can never rate them, too bad for me?!!"
4,A good stepping stone,This is a very good book for someone who has a basic understanding of Saint Augustine's philosophy and wants to gain a better understanding of his times and how this influenced his development before embarking on further study.
2,NOT AN INTRODUCTION,"Wills' essay on Augustine was written for a series of new introductions for use by students and the public. But unlike Peter Brown's superb biography, now stronger than ever after its revised 2000 edition, Wills does a very poor job introducing big chunks of Augustine's life and background. If you don't know about Donatism and Pelagianism, or have never heard of Julian of Eclanum, Wills won't help you. His selection of themes and angles is almost eccentric and he skates over way too much. This is an essay for the specialist who knows the background and wants another pungent point of view. It is not a beginner's survey. If Augustine interests you, try Henry Chadwick's short, superb ""Augustine"" from Oxford, or dive into the warm, deep waters of Peter Brown's book."
5,Carlyle does it again,"Well I was not disappointed with the latest Liz Carlyle novel. From the first paragraph I was hooked, and chuckling all the way. I love Ms Carlyle's turn of phase and her use of humor, as she told the story of Helene and Cam. Two very contrasting individual's that are the perfect foils for each other. I am still chuckling about the way that Helene with no effort or even knowledge had Cam turned inside out and not knowing which way was up. He meant to do one thing, but just being in her presence found him doing the opposite I loved it. But more than that the book plot had substance and lead you down a merry path right into the mouth of danger. A tender story of first love's second chance, doing the right things even when they are the hard things and taking the risk for happiness. This book has something for everyone. Hats off to a great storyteller, and please keep them coming."
3,reunited lovers with a twist,"this could have been a boring book but all the characters,major & minor, were so well developed, that one couldn't help but be drawn into their world. i especially liked helene's understanding of the traumatized child whose type of affliction was a twist to the usual governess stories and cam's deep affection for his child. i'm not a big liz carlyle fan but i would read this book again."
3,For Completists Only,"As brilliant as Bob Marley is/was - he had to start somewhere and this CD gives you a glimpse of his ""formative years"" and like an adult formative years, this is the CD where he learns to sing, write and perform. And to be perfect blunt, if he had stopped here, it's already better than 90% of the reggae CD's out there but compared to the staggeringly brilliant and genius output of later years - this is pretty pale and at best an amusing mix of calypso, reggae lite and early, early 1950's pop-rock. For completists and scholars of reggae only - if you fall into that category, this is definitely worth the price of used. If you are just a casual listener of reggae, you won't find much here. There is also an import version with 3-5 more tracks."
2,Why shold Heros be reborn? Were they dead?,"The Fantastic Four will NEVER die. They will stand united and fight for justice until all the members die in unison. This relaunch of the Fantastic Four by Jim Lee is visually stunning. Perhaps the best of the Heros Reborn group. However, is it necessary? I think not. I give two stars for the art, ZERO stars for the story or originality. I'd recommend The Essential Fantastic Four for the best FF stories. I'd recommend waiting for the Carlos Pancheo and Jeph Loeb series which would surely be bound together in Trade paperback form in the near future. I'd recommend many individual issues of the FF, but this series is so unnecessary that I was completely regretful of my purchase. If you like Jim Lee's art, buy it. If you like FF as a group, don't. If you like to collect trade paperbacks, get it. If you like to collect great stories in one volume, don't get this. This will disappoint even the most sympathetic comic reader."
2,DVD skips,I purchased two Season 1 Mash and both the DVD's skip in the same spot and will not play. Poor quality. I also purchased Seasons 2 - 5. Hope they are not a bad!!
3,Don't buy VHS!,"The DVD may be great, but the VHS version has lousy pic and sound quality....recorded in EP mode. Also, the episodes are out of order....and are out of order from what is written on the box, as well. Did a chimp in the back room record these tapes? I have better quality home recordings of MASH, recorded off FX."
5,The best season of MASH for laughs,Season one was a brilliant mix of comedy and subtle drama. As nearly a rule there was no laugh track allowed in the OR (though in 3rd season ep The General Flipped at Dawn this sacred rule got violated. Back to season one there was not as much authenticity to real Korea in this first season as there was in later seasons. It's very much a sitcom but even here it is way deeper than McHale's Navy.
2,Disapointed,"I was disapointed: no extras. A main I but dvds are for commentaries. I bet they weren't included was to save $.The same goes for Mision Impossible Season 1.Further, I bet many omit theme songs to avoid royalties,If this is important to you check before you buy."
3,American Formula Television,What do you get when you mix Groucho Marx irreverence with Dean Martin style boozing/womanizing and typical American sitcom preachiness... that's right you get MASH! Unfortunately this is the best of the series. I used to say that I liked the first couple of seasons when it was still a comedy and before it became The Alan Alda Knows Best Show but seeing these first episodes again makes me realize this show always was a one trick pony. Simply put I find Alda's snappy banter and easy self righteous indignance more than a little irritating. Big budget production and some decent acting from supporting cast members especially Larry Linville (who plays a perfect straight arrow doofus) keeps the whole thing tolerable but this show really hasn't aged well and comes across as typically mediocre American fare. The movie is much better in every respect!
5,It will live forever.,"Undoubtedly, the finest series ever! All the characters were portrayed in detail and believable fashion."
4,"Needs a ""Play All"" feature",Loved M*A*S*H forever - DVD's great - extra footage great - picture quality great - able to turn the laugh track off great - only able to watch one episode at a time - LOUSY - only complaint of a first rate season one box set - looking forward to the next ten - but c'mon FOX - get your act together and make the next 10 able to play the whole disc at once.
5,"At last, I can see all the episodes IN ORDER!","I am delighted beyond description that this series is coming out on DVD !!! This is my wife's all-time favorite TV show, both because she is a retired nurse, and because it's a sit-com with some real depth to it. We've just about memorized every episode and we still laugh together every time we watch.What we've been watching, however, are a bunch of old VHS tapes that we recorded off the TV back in the mid-80s, which range in quality from pretty good to abysmally snowy, depending on what the reception was like that day in rural Minnesota. (No, we don't have cable out here...) Our homemade tapes are the uncut episodes as aired by a local station, but they are all badly out of order and we are missing a few episodes. So, it will be wonderful to see MASH uncut, in order, with no commercials and in DVD quality. I ordered my Season 1 set today and I do hope that the other 10 seasons come out on DVD very soon. I plan to collect them all."
1,The Reluctant Fiancee,"I agree with another posting in regards to this book. It literally made my skin crawl, I found the 'hero' to be creepy and predatory. As a guardian, seemed that he had pounced on the poor girl before she had a chance to grow up. Since reading this book I have made a point to stay away from any books by the same author so I can't compare it to her other offerings."
2,A Disappointing Quest,"Although mainly reading the book as an obligation, I expected that the topic of wrestling would be enough to keep me interested. To my disappointment the book was mainly about a teenage boys and his ""experiences"" that distract him from the sport. The content was out of place and, at times, disturbing. The author builds up a mediocre amount of suspension when Louden decides to go one-weight class lower, yet manages to disappoint the reader again with an incomplete ending which fails to leave the reader with a sense of curiosity or satisfaction."
2,Very little SQL 2000 specific information,"This book might as well have been called SQL Server 7 or even 6.5.. Practically no informaiton on the new and emerging features of SQL 2000 - mainly XML support. There are plenty of other excellent books that conquered the same territory already, and didn't even need to include ""SQL 2000"" in the title."
1,Movie Game 'nough Said,"It's a typical movie game here the developer spent all there time trying to match the movie, and not creating good gameplay. You have like two attack moves and that's it. so have fun pushing one button the whole game."
3,Fans of the POC movies will like this,"Gameplay: Simple. Different puzzles to solve, things to find, skills to acquire. Nothing new here.Graphics: Very good (still not sure what ""Next-Gen"" is supposed to be, but I don't think this is it). The scenery/environment is well done.Music, sounds: Very good. This captures the Pirate motif."
1,Metal Doors or Gates,"Beware trying to use this item, or any like it, on or near metal doors or gates. It will not work no matter how close!!!"
2,1.5 Stars,"Sure this product has great nutritional benefits, but do choose on taste too. I'm sure the chocolate flavor is delicious as almost all chocolate flavors are. However, I purchased the strawberry in hopes of making great tasting strawberry lemonade smoothies. Let me tell you that NOTHING, and i mean NOTHING can kill the HORRIBLE taste of the strawberry flavor... I do recommend buying this but do not even try the strawberry flavor on a full stomach because it will not be full for long..."
4,Good Protein,I like this stuff and on paper it seems to be really good. I purchased this when my last stuff ran out. But the Amplify XL I used before this was my favorite protein. The only problem was its twice as expensive. If I could find it cheaper I would go back to the Amplify.
2,What sort of supreme being would condone the existence of this?,"I sat through this movie sheerly out of morbid curiosity. I was wondering if they were going to tie the beginning to the middle, or the middle to the end, or any combination of the above. The first 30 minutes make no sense whatsoever after which it is merely disjointed. Armand Assante must really be hurting for work. It's slightly better than a series of disjointed images topped with a really nice Dodge Challenger and Rachelle Leah in short shorts.But hey, it's Rachelle Leah in short shorts."
5,great for any parents and educators,Im a teacher of Physical Education there are fantastic ideas that helped my class learn about fitness and nutrition all while having fun
2,Better books available,"Being a physical education teacher, I was looking forward to getting some new ideas. I was disappointed in this book, and the children who looked at the book agreed it should be called Fit Girls. Nothing really new or original. There are much better books available."
3,Mavreen's daughter grows up,"This book is as frustrating as the last one, though entertaining. Tamarisk is not as likeable as her mother, being a bit of a spoiled brat who tends to run away from home a lot if someone upsets her or if she imagines herself to be in love. However, this book starts with Tamarisk being told Gerard is her father and that Mavreen is going to marry him. Then it shows Mavreen and Gerard married and really getting to know each other. They discover, of course, that even though they've loved each other for many years, they really don't have a whole lot in common and rarely agree on anything unless they're in the sack together. Figures. Gerard turns out to be a big jerk and you just find yourself wishing Mavreen would divorce him and marry Gideon like she should have in the first place. Can't wait to read Chantal, the third in the series."
5,one of the better books on marriage,"I have read many books on marriage but found this one to be different and most helpful. It outlined how my wife and i fight, and then showed us a way out of our fight cycle. We are beginning to learn how to stay emotionally connected, despite our differences. I highly recommend it. We are reading through this book at our monthly couples group - and find the questions at the end of each chapter very helpful."
4,Great add-on to Metal Gear: Solid!,"This game doesn't have a story... But that is actually a good thing! VR Missions is great for those of us who have to wedge game playing between an ever-changing schedule. Most levels take anywhere from 30 seconds to five mintues... and you can exit anytime and save your game. So, if you have to get up and run... you really haven't lost anything if you take ten seconds to exit and save.It has all the classic moves from MGS, and some fun levels like ""Mystery"" (arrest the right murder suspect), Puzzle (think enemy-dominos) and round after round of weapon-based combat (so you don't ALWAYS have to sneak around).I'd say pick this one up, with a ten-dollar price tag, there isn't much of a reason not to!"
1,Virtual Disappointment,"Upon completion of Metal Gear Solid last Christmas '98, I was looking forward to Komani's next offering in the genre, VR Missions. I rushed out and bought it. I wish I had read the valuable reviews here first, I was very disappointed. This game, if you can call it that, is just taking advantage of the success of its predocessor, Metal Gear Solid. I did not have fun with it and it was not challenging. The operation of weapons are limited and do not allow for traditional aiming as in Metal Gear, rather a laser scope dresses it up a bit, but does not give you freedom to be efficient in tactics or battle. I would rather see Konami do something original rather than produce reconstituted practice missions."
1,A bad case of pretentiousness,"A very weak album. There are only about three legitimate songs on the whole disc, the rest are sound effects of horses galloping, rainy weather, and strange babbling. This is a turn-off for people who like real gothic music, not just a pretentious show. Pick any other disc by Christian Death and you are off to a better start."
3,You Get What You Pay For......,"It is nice to have Five inputs and Two outputs: 2 AV (composite) in/ 1 AV out and 3 RF in 1 RF out. It is relatively easy to use, and will take all inputs and switches between the two quite easily.The only drawback to this is that It has poor shielding either INSIDE or OUTSIDE, and the RF out creates an unacceptable picture that shimmers slightly (annoying, to say the least). I wish I had a better constructed switcher -but hey!....YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
5,"The Splicing Handbook: Techniques for Modern and Traditional Ropes, Second Edition","This book contains expert information that is quite easy to understand for a beginner. It also has numerous illustrations, which are clear and easy to read."
5,So glad it's available,"I used to be able to buy this in my local supermarket and in BJ's wholesale club. I preferred BJ's because they sold in in a larger size. However, about a year ago they discontinued it so it was back to hunting supermarket shelves. I don't understand why a product this popular is so hard to get. Thank goodness for Amazon. I just wish they would carry it in the larger size."
4,Very sturdy but does not fold up quickly,Got it as a gift for someone that plays only at home. It was perfect for this. It's quite strong and sturdy; holds the Yamaha P95 88-key with ease and can hold a keyboard much wider.Might not recommend for someone playing shows as it does not folder up quickly; need to remove 1 screw on each side.
3,passing time or passing the torch?,"I LOVE kd's voice. She has my respect for many things she's done in her career, musical and not. Still, this album doesn't excite me. The idea is great. Many of the song choices are superb. But it all sounds too smoooooth. Sounds like kd has gone too much for the middle of the road. Neil Young says something like it's better to head for the ditch where it's more interesting. Hymns need to be heard from the soul. That can be noisy and rough. It's not always nice and polished. kd can reach there but seems content to stop short here.I applaud kd for being head and shoulders above most singers heard on radio today and for bringing attention to deserving songwriters with this collection.The young Canadian singer Allison Crowe released a version of Hallelujah last year that can be heard in the Amazon free downloads section. A voice, a piano, and zero budget. It's pure passion transmitted.Strip away the gloss and kd can move people the same way."
3,CD Condition,"The CD is great but unfortunately the two songs I just love have scratches and when I purchased it, the condition was listed as ""good""."
3,What's up with all these down tempo songs???,"I agree with the reviewer who said this album needs more up tempo songs. kd's voice has never sounded better but it would have been nice to hear some other types of songs. If you want a fun, new kd song, check out the song she did for the Disney movie, Home on the Range. She does a song called Little Patch of Heaven. If you loved kd doing country you will love this fun song."
2,"Try again, kd!","I was a big kd lang fan at one time. I have all of her albums up to Ingenue and probably should get the one she did with Tony Bennett.I listened to this one in the record store and found it really boring. If you liked the songs done by the original artists, you won't like what kd has done with them. The only song I really like is Hallelujah. I used to think that kd could make even singing the phone book sound good! I'm sorry to see that for albums like Drag and All You Can Eat, she seems to have taken me up on it. At least for this album, she picked some good songs.Still, if you loved Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, you might be like me and not want to hear them done by another artist. It just doesn't cut it for me. I wish kd would go back to country. I loved Absolute Torch and Twang, Shadowland, and Angel with a Lariat."
5,one of the top 5 cd's i've ever heard,This is K D Lang at her very best. I rate this CD as one of the top-five that I've ever listened to. The feeling and honesty with which she sings and her impeccable choice of material make this a most enjoyable listening experience. This is a CD that will never grow old.
5,Pure Bliss,"These old gentlemen takes us away on a lysergic journey to guitar land. Love the ""RAW"" production , sounds like you have ZZ Top playingin your living room! Some parts reminds me more of Kyuss , Queens Of Stoneage etc.. Daddy is back!"
2,"The performer's voice, not Gershwin's","Mario-Ratko Delorko is a gifted and skilled pianist who in this recording expresses his own artistic voice and soul, not Gershwin's.If Gershwin's wonderful syncopated rhythms and infectious melodies were crystals, it is as though Delorko poured watercolors onto the crystals, melting and deforming them into shapes that may be beautiful or interesting but no longer look (or sound) like George Gershwin's original music. In addition, Delorko has a very fluid, spontaneously ever-changing approach to dynamics and tempos as well.In this recording you will hear Delorko's voice, although it will sometimes have a Gershwin accent."
4,a band to look out in the future.,"the first time i heard their single,`special' on mtv, i was bowled over by their music...love the lead singer's voice,so sweet,sometimes androgynous,i have to say...:]this album is worth buying for the discerning music lovers..worth every penny.."
4,A Civilian's Look at the War,"I enjoyed this book immensely, and its tales of Antebellum southern manners being put to test by the war. Mary's insights and daily activies shed light on things I had never really considered, and highlighted the extreme poverty the South faced during and after the war. It wasn't hard reading, and I always appreciate pictures being included in a biography."
4,A Diary from Dixie,I truly enjoyed A Diary from Dixie. The author was so descriptive of events taking place in her life as a southern belle during the Civil War. At times I felt I was seeing it through her eyes. A truly new way to experience those particular events at that time in our history as well as see a personal side to many of the Confederate heroes.
3,"Unless a hardcore fan, buy something else","When I first bought Cartoon Studio I expected a feast of Simpsons delights that I would never tire of. For the first few days, I was right. But those few days were spent learning how to use the program. Now I am completely bored. The character movements are limited, and some don't fit any of their phrases- eg. Grampa Simpson has a lot of phrases but his only movement is to be asleep and snoring in a rocking chair! The characters' mouths don't move AT ALL so you can't make it look like they're saying anything. And the five-minute limit to your cartoons is also restrictive. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE A HARDCORE SIMPSONS FAN!"
2,gets 2 cause it's not as wreatched Valor's other stuff...,"...but still an embarrasing stab at 80's hair metal. Give thisthieving clod credit: he'll do ANYTHING to try to get noticed."" We fall like Love "" is an okay ballad, but the rest of thisalbum actually makes you wish you WERE listening to Motley Crue...Scrap it.Kaenan"
1,The Worst Christian Death CD,"The other positive reviews here, though well written, attest to the unfortunate reality that there really is nothing for fans of Gothic Rock on this CD. The only exception is the ballad ""We Fall Like Love,"" which is available on the ""Jesus Points The Bone"" compilation. It really is the worst Christian Death album, and I say that in all sincerity, as an adrent fan and a long time collector of their discography. Fans of Rozz Williams will probably know to avoid this, and fans of Valor will only be disappointed. The corresponding darker and more aggressive release, ""All The Hate,"" is a bit of an improvement, but has only a few standout tracks. These conceptual double-albums are pretty much what spoiled Valor's reputation. However, the next few releases ""Sexy Death God"" and ""Insanus..."" showed Valor back on track, making focussed and solid Gothic Rock music."
2,Take photos of your own baby for a treasure.,"OK, some of the photos are really good, others are average. We received this as a shower gift. Why do I want a book filled with photos of complete strangers and their babies? I think a photo album and a few rolls of film to create a book of our own expectant baby would have been much better. If you like looking at pictures of babies, this book is good, but diapers, toy or clothes would be better."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"The material is not presented in any of the ""classic"" forms. I could not pull any useful information from this book. I should have returned it! Other books like ""The Art of Control Engineering"" <Dutton et el>, and ""Control Engineering"" <Parr> are much better supplemental material."
3,DOES NOT WORK ON MAC OS 10!,"Unless you have a Mac Classic, this will not work. Do not be fooled by Amazon's description above."
2,Fun is diminished by it not staying together,"My 9-year-old really enjoys the dragon series, but only when he ignores the directions and configures his own castles. The Draigar castle simply will not stay together per the directions. If you have a child that likes to build according to directions, stay away from this one."
1,Impractical,"The suggestions in this book are completely impractical. For instance, it recommends that everyone have their hair tested for vitamin deficiencies before trying to conceive, but then states that there is a lot of controversy over whether hair testing is accurate. So unless you want to only drink water out of glass bottles, give up swimming so that the uterus doesn't get cold, only drink dandelion coffee, and give up sex for a month to get to know your body, I do not recommend this book.More than half of the book is on infertility treatments, so I would not recommend this book for anyone who hasn't already tried conceiving naturally and had issues."
5,Excellent Overview of Fertility & Conception,"This book was an excellent overview on fertility and conception. The layout and pictures made it a pleasure to read. This book was great at covering what the body goes through every month, how to time conception, general health for both man and women, and if there is difficulty getting pregnant, what the options are. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about getting pregnant and concerned about their own fertility."
4,Great book for teaching my Child Development Class,"This is the ""textbook"" that I use to introduce my students to how to get yourself ready for conception and then the steps in conceiving. The author is a bit ""too hippy"" for me talking a lot about natural medicine, herbs, and accupuncture which personally, I'm not into. But if you skip those sections- the information is great. I started teaching the child development course prior to wanting to have a baby, but we are now TTC and I'm using the information I've taught them to direct myself for conception too."
3,This book can be EQUALLY applied to both males & females,"I've had the opportunity of reading this book at the suggestion of my lady-friend, who wanted to know how I felt about the contents. After reading ""What Smart Women Know"" I feel:There is no Mr. Right NOR Ms. Right. The authors could have easily replaced the word ""women"" with ""men"" or used both ""women & men"" in their title and used gender neutral personal pronouns in their contents. The thoughts, ideas and information brought forth by the authors are good, however I believe to ensure that their book sales were successful they cose to use the word ""women"" because studies have shown that books with ""women"" in the title sell."
4,Great travel iron!!,"I just got this today for my upcoming cruise. My last cruise my husband & I spent way too much money by sending our clothes to get ironed. I tried this out on several outfits, and I was pleasantly surprised! It gets hotter than I expected and heats up very quickly for a travel iron. This is a great money saver for me and my husband."
2,Not worth it.....,"I was excited to receive this iron steamer, but when I tried to use the steamer, water would squirt out of it, soaking my clothing. The iron works ok, but the steamer does not work at all. First of all, there is a very small container for the water, second, you have to press the button repeatedly for steam to come out (like a regular iron). Not much steam comes out, but tons of water squirts out, soaking your clothes. I'm not happy with this product at all. I ended up buying the esteem steamer, which by the way is wonderful and it works better than my large in home steamer."
4,I like it!,"At first, I was overjoyed. The iron is very compact and the handle flips out to be full size iron and a steamer. So I wanted to try the steamer out.. and it wouldn't work. After letting it heat up, the no steam would come out. I held the button for what seemed like forever. But I didn't want to give up because the iron was just so dang cute. After many many minutes and holding the steam button down.. i think I actually laid the iron on it's side.. it fiiiiiiiiinally started steaming.I'm very satisfied. The iron's adorable. It even comes with it's own steam measuring cup and carrying bag."
1,Disappointing travel iron,"I am so disappointed with this travel iron/steamer! The product description sounded great: iron + steamer + lint brush. Wrong! The iron wouldn't heat up enough to get rid of any wrinkles, and the ""steam"" just leaked all over my clothes."
2,Vocabulary but not conversational,"while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool, I found it did not help with conversation."
3,Good software but...,"Good if you want to speak the Spanish of the minority. Only 10% of the native Spanish speakers live in Spain. The grammar of the Spanish from Spain (or as some incorrectly call it, the Castilian Spanish, although castilian -castellano- and spanish -español- mean the same in Spanish) the ""interesting"" grammar of the so called castilian Spanish (the misuse of direct and indirect objets, and the confussion between the perfect and simple past tenses) are anomalies in the Latin American Spanish: that means for 300 million speakers in Latin America. You choose!"
2,hot little corset,"i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it."
3,Good resources but boring,"As an Art History guru, I love reading about everything art. But this is just a far cry from good. How boring, I had a hard time turning the pages, even finding it interesting.Good resources and photos, but I found it boring."
2,"Boring, but informative",This book has everything a fundamentalist could ever dream of in terms of nailing down what Christianity is all about... but could it be any more boring? I think not. No wonder my friend turned atheist after reading this book. Any religion this bland would be a turn off.
1,What a joke!,"We were suppost to have a dual 3Ghz Powermac G5, alomst a year ago! Isn't that what I promised? Ha, what a joke, 2.7 GHz! Oh, a nice .2 GHz speed bump. Here you go, you're welcome!"
4,Great help!,I am just starting to learn Japanese and this book is so helpful! It explains almost all the things I needed to know.Thank you for writing this book!
2,only japanese in concept,"The biggest issue is that there is not Japanese characters. That's like someone Japanese learning English without knowing a single Latin character! In that case, they wouldn't even understand what is being written here! Read this book it is only good for an brief introduction into that language, other than that, it is useless if you plan to go to Japan."
2,A CD I wish to enjoy,"Blame it on me, but I just find it hard to enjoy this CD. I really can't tell what it is about the CD that made it so not enjoyable. I probably played it once after I received from the mail. I guess it may well deserve a second listening."
4,protection,"I bought the neck protector since i didn't want to get hit obviously in the neck in some weird angle, I am a beginner so it was entirely possible. I actually did end up getting hit and it didn't hurt or leave any mark on my neck. It is an appropriate size for me, i am 6ft 3in and 220lbs and doesn't bother while in use. I used it in hot 80-95 degrees and cold environments 30 degrees and no issue with chaffing itching etc."
1,Piece of crap,This item sucks!! it is small and does notgive much protection to your neck. you are betteroff wrapping a bandanna or one of those taliban wrapsaround your neck for protection.. do not buy unlessyou wanna piss yourself off or get shot in the neck!!!
5,"BUY IT NOW!! A Great Modern Piano Recital: Xenakis, Finnissy, Feldman,...","First off, this is a GREAT performance of 'Evryali', rivaling the untouchable Ms. Takahashi on Mode. I just can't say enough here.Second, the Finnissy and Feldman take up a good portion of the disc. Again, the performances are exemplary. Surely you know what you're getting here. I was especially surprised by the Finnissy (not a blizzard of notes, but very thought provoking).The other three pieces are all worthy in their own way. The title track alone lasts less than two minutes!I'm skimming here (tired of writing for the day!), but I can't make enough 'Buy It Now!' faces to convince you that this is one of the best Modern Piano Recitals on disc I've heard. Do your research, but I think you'll end up picking this one up.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION"
1,No good,"The box it came in claims it can hold up to 1pound(450grams) which is a blatant lie. It can't even hold a nickel(5grams) on a wall! This is like the generic version of Blue tack, and they cost the same too."
3,blu tack,"I was a bit disappointed as I usually use blu tack to hang posters, etc. on the wall and it usually works well. The ornament that I hung on my door after I received this product fell down within hours of putting it up."
1,College=Posters,"I used the blue sticky tack Freshman year for a lot of posters and never once had a problem. This semester, using the white scotch stuff, my posters fall on my head in the middle of the night...often multiple times. I'm a bit fed up with that. The quality of this tack is so atrocious compared to the blue putty which is the same price! I just popped on here to get myself some blue putty, saw this product for sale, felt an intense rage build in me (this was a night when my poster fell on my head multiple times), and had to write a review. So, I'm off to buy some good tack. (Hint, not this stuff)"
4,mc review,"Marauders Cliff is a really fun toy.this toy is not just about getting the perfect structure, it's about6 expressing the kids imagination. When i first got it i thought wow this is going to be really fun. I was right this toy is awsone. as far as durability goes some times weapons might break but not alot if they do then get a tin set that comes with more weapons and guys. and finally educational value is perfect. A kid could really have fun with this toy.They can build whatever they want and create whole new worlds. this set is very very very fun and educational."
2,Didn't last long,The hearing protection was great and the mics worked well also but... after the first duck season the head band broke in two. You can't get parts for it so the price is not worth the end product. I sent Radians an E-Mail but never received a reply.
4,Works Well,"I just got this product and it works very well. Not only does it amplify the sounds but it also is very easy to tell what direction they are coming from. The one draw back is that it is not a crystal clear sound, but that is very minor. Not sure what the other review was talking about having a mute mode. It is either on or off on each side and has volume control for each side once on."
3,It was a bit hard to give this a full 3 stars because the acting and lines are often stilted.,"Wind at My Back: The Complete First SeasonI enjoy ""period"" dramas or drama-comedies about ""real life."" This series is in that genre, and has some good qualities. However,I wish the acting was better. Perhaps it's that way in part due to the script and the directing.Also, because it is portraying most of the characters as ""Christians,"" it would be refreshing to see some of them have a more personal relationship with God, such as relying on Him in need, realizing they need to be forgiving to others (because Christ has forgiven us), and being thankful to Him."
4,its alright,"i dont actually own this album yet, but i have heard alot of it. I like most of what i have heard, but then again i also like thrashy metal type music in addition to the more melodic sounds of other Christian Death CD's. Born in a Womb, Died in a Tomb is a cool tune. This does sound like it would appeal to a more heavy metal/industrial audience. not bad, but not the best either."
5,Very Creative Truth of the Matter,When reading Dharma it is important to trust the source of the words. Here you have important info from an Enlightened source
3,Too much perfection,"This was a sweet story about a woman coming to the United States and coming to work for a widower and his three children. The relationships grew very slowly and was believable. The love between Alec and Sophie took some time to grow and was very sweet. It was a sweet story. But...The children were way too perfect, and they talked more like adults than children. They all behaved like adults. They were teenagers, and I just cannot believe there wasn't more trouble. They never did anything wrong, they never fought, they never made the wrong choices (with a few dramatic exceptions). I just didn't feel like any of them were real...Even Sophie's and Alec were just way too perfect...So of all Lori Wick's books I've read thus far, this is my least favorite. But it was still an enjoyable read."
3,ArtificialBlond-E,"I usually love Lori Wick's books, but this one i didn't like as much as the other ones. It was slow going trying to get through all the ""let's take it slow sort of thing."" And i haven't really experienced love, but it seemed they fell into it very quick like. but you don't really know Sophie's feelings for the longest time. And even though Alec discovered his feelings for her before Sophie's was even mentioned, it took her looks to even get him to look at her twice. i was surprised when i was finished that no attention grabbers were in the story because Lori Wick always seems to put in at least a few that i had no idea that it was going to happen. Even though i didn't find this book to be the best, i highly suggest Lori Wick's other books."
1,Overpriced clunker,"I have a brand-new top of the line g5 with twin 2.7ghz processors.It's terrible! It's crashed my Microsoft Word so many times I can't even count. Safari crashes regularly. Itunes crashes regularly. I can't believe I spent so much money on this lemon... maybe everyone's right when they say Apple is in truth an inferior product which people only buy because of the mystique, not the quality."
2,Virtual XI,"I reviewed X factor by saying that it was a solid overall album.When x factor came out originally, it was 1995 and i didn't originally like it (still missing bruce). So when virtual XI came out, there was a hope for optimism (as is the case with every maiden album). however, nothing disappointed me more than when i heard the first two minutes of angel and the gambler. I hope i don't insult anybody but songs are too long, boring and repetative. In angel in the gambler, he says ""Don't you think i'm a saviour"" like 65 times or something. and there are other songs that are repetative like this.What I like, the clansman and futureal and the guitar solo's. some of the best solo's i've heard. but overall, it is a forgetable album. Don't get me wrong, the reason i don't like it is not because blaze is the singer, i just find that maiden was trying too hard to be maiden. i would give it a 1.5/5. Tour for that album was quite good though."
5,Strong heavy album,Not their best album but all iron maiden albums get 5 stars from me.Futureal is fast and the clansman is timeless.Surely not as good as Brave new world which i recentely bought but definatly under rated and worth the money.
4,Is it me?,"I think its on tracks 4 and 5 that it sounds like the same song being played over. Don't get me wrong I love the beautiful music, and the sounds are out of this universe, but whenever i listen to this c.d. and I hear the start of track 5, its like deja vu. I might of not even noticed if it was spread out, but its right after another. Other than that little nit pick, this music is a gorgeous twist on already beautiful music. If you love mozart its a must have."
5,The kid in me remembers this book,"I was lucky enough to have this book read to me when it first came out. I would search it out when I wanted to look at wonderful pictures, much darker than in most of my other books at the time. Dark because the story takes place at night, but also dark because of the mischief that the firefly gets into. I hope to find it someday soon for my son. It's a timeless story and he's so much like me, that I know he'll love it."
4,An old favourite,An old favourite that many parents would have read themselves as children. A great book both as a story book to be read to younger children and a first reader for children as they get older and learn to read themselves. The story is quite funny and is about being responsible and the consequences of one's actions.
5,Great Resource for a Bible Student,"I read a lot of books on biblical sites and have never come across such a well organized book, with very helpful information. The book describes biblical significance of the site and also explains archaeological remains at the site. I would definitely recommend to take this book along while traveling to any location in Paul's journey."
2,a disapointment,"Lens is displayed with a nice deco box that you are sure has good protection along with lens caps and perhaps some instructions. My Opteka lens arrived in a paper envelope, lens in a plastic bag, no box no instructions no packing material and no packing slip from the shipper. I have corosponded with the retailer twice and they claim they just ship the product the way they get it from the manufacture. As to the lens it's self the optical portion of the lens is so much smaller that the lens you attatch it to you are guaranteed light fall off with very dark corners. The stored has offered a 10% discount on my next purchase, Oh well live and learn."
4,Good and inexpensive upgrade/option,"Good glass, solidly constructed. Works very well for stationary subjects; requires M-Focus as well as camera location adjustment, so moving shots (i.e. insects) can be tricky. Expect to lean in VERY close to the subject.I'm very pleased with this purchase, especially considering the price. Even if eventually replaced with a dedicated macro, this lens can always serve as a hand-held magnifying lens or smaller tag-along option. I currently use this with an EF 18-55 Canon kit lens."
3,Very good for the price,"It is a good lens for amateur macro shots, very low chromatic aberration, it delivers good IQ at the center of image but some distortion further towards the edges.Be aware that it really is a 40mm lens mounted to fix 58mm threads, so it vignettes A LOT when wide angle.Used on a Sony DSC HX100V works quite good at medium zoom ranges, but not so when wide angle (vignette) or Xtreme zooming in (low IQ) while delivering very narrow depth of field (DOF) also.But to be fair, I've gotten some very good and great shots with it.A good deal after all."
5,An Elusive Telling,"I began Autobiography of a Family Photo after finishing Sandra Cisneros' House on Mango Street. As I read, I couldn't help but compare the two. What most impressed me was how Jacqueline Woodson created a convincing child's voice, yet at the same time, wove more sophisticated elements into the story. Woodson's writing style, transitions, and overall conception makes Autobiography of a Family Photo a complex, poetic read."
3,Yuck,I must say this is one of the worst read from Mrs. Griffin.I could not get into to any of the charters. The story had a good plot but there was no sparks in the couples. I got so sick of them walking on eggshells about money. I mean come on get real. The love scene was whack nothing to keep me up late at night. Don't get me wrong I love Bettye books just not this one
2,Not Close Enough,"This book was slow and boring. Ivy Smith and Raymond Jones were a nice enough pair but their relationship contained little heat and absolutely NO!! fire. Mitch or Ray they both were so low keyed I was almost hoping she would chose Bethany her equally wealthy sister friend. The secondary characters were predictable and irritating, I had to force myself to finish this book. Many women earn more money than their men for some it's an issue for some it's not, either way they GET-OVER-IT or GET-OVER-each other, in the case of Ray and Ivy it would not have made a difference. I give two stars for Ray's daughters Mya and Yolanda who as far as I'm concerned was the only good thing about this dull story. I have never read any other books of Ms Griffin although I have one on my shelf, I chose this one because a website I visit gave it a good rating. They must be grading on a curve because it was truly a waste of the time I could've spent reading something a little more compelling."
5,A Classic...don't pass it up,"I read this book more than thirty five years ago and I still remember it vividly. I was about 6 or 7 years old when I first checked it out of the library, and that windy harbor and Sam's personality has stayed with me all these years. I am ordering a copy for my youngest daughter and hope the power of these words impresses her the same way they impressed me as a child. Oh! The joy of reading a good book!Tracy Price-Thompson, author of A Woman's Worth."
3,My opinion,"This book is readable, but over 3/4 of it is not realistic. It keeps you wanting to know what happens next, but too much of it is just not realistic. That's my opinion."
1,ordered one sent two charged two,I ordered one copy of this book to go to someone in prison and she charged my cc twice and sent the book twice. I will never buy from her again.
2,Mild Porn!,"I've read several of Ms. Macomber's books. Most are romantic with implied sexuality if any at all. Although I'm not a prude by any means, I found the graphic descriptions of sex between Carrie and Kyle to be a bit of a shock because it seems out of character for her writing style. Many of her books have a religious thread in them since they deal with angels or have titles like God's Guest List. No one in this book was remotely angelic.That being said, I found the whole premise of two people who literally hated each other so badly that they were at risk of losing their jobs all of a sudden becoming lovers and planning a life together within a couple of days to be ludicrous. Reminded me of the whole Bachelor/ Bachelorette premise. Life and love just don't happen that way.Ms. Macomber should stick to what she does so very well and leave the graphic sexuality to the Harlequin series that so it quite well. Her attempt seemed like an awkward foray into an unfamiliar territory."
3,A bit predictable,"Although the scenarios were a bit far-fetched, the fact that there would be some silly problem was all too predictable."
2,A little disappointed,"I have been reading Debbie Macomber's books for about 2 months now. I read the Cedar Cove series and I'm waiting on book No. 8. I thought they were just fabulous. I also read one of the angel series. I thought it was excellent. ""One Night"" was so much like a corny Harlequin. There seemed to be ""too much"" excitement with sex and too much ""in love"" business going on. It was an ok read, but I much prefer books written like Cedar Cove."
5,Under & Over by the Clover,"Books were Christmas gifts for the grandbabies. They -- and theim moms -- had fun with the book, and learned too!"
3,A Serious Anatomical Inaccuracy,"This book fails to show an essential piece of mammalian anatomy - the foreskin. This is an affront to all normal humans who have not been surgically deprived of half of the skin on their normal penis. Since not a single solitary national medical organization in the entire world approves of routine infant circumcision, it is hardly appropriate for an anatomy book to omit it. This is a striking example of how far the circumcizers will go to promote this human rights violation."
1,Beautiful images and motivating book,"This book, despite its age, is an excellent introduction and instruction to explore iterated functions, Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. This is essentially done on the backbone of quadratic maps but the beauty and essential features are explored. The pseudo code could be adapted to whatever favourite language one chooses.The colour plates are beautiful by themselves. It motivates me, in my spare time, to do my own experiments (the author's main purpose for the book)."
3,Ok,It was ok. There were too many lines in it that were obviouslly written for parents and they tried hard to be witty. Tom & j should be about physical comedy.
2,Not a fan,Sorry to say that this DVD is not a crowd pleaser in my family. We like the old Tom & Jerry.
2,Suitable For Older Kids,"This is definitely for older kids or maybe even adults, I got this for my 3 and 6 yr old, they didn't get most of the humor, and the chases weren't all that funny."
2,Ordinary and Irritating,"Sorry to say, there is nothing on this CD worth my time. They sound like the male equivalent of Sarah MacLachlan..whine, whine, whine. I strongly suggest trying DBT's earlier efforts and passing on this thing that was refined like Wonder Bread; No taste, no texture."
4,Good quality,"I found this very easy to install (rear facing). Our 9 month old loves it especially how she can sit up more and look around. She seems very comfortsble and the straps are easy to adjust. I do think the straps could be tight around her thighs if she keeps growing at this rate, but so far so good."
5,Great safe car seat,"This was the highest rated Consumer Reports car seat and is smaller than the Britax Marathon. It was easy to install, especially for the LATCH system cars and easy to use. No complaints and our son likes it better."
3,WATCH BOX LEATHER STORAGE CASE,"Item is made of very good quality and looks very professional; however, this item is designed for small, thin watches. The pockets are too tight and it makes it difficult to fit medium or large sized watches. Other than that this item is perfect..."
1,waste of money,"I was so exited to get this product, thinking I can charge all of my electrics, such as DVD player and e-book reader on the road. But my hope was shattered as soon as I plugged the devise in the cigarette lighter; black smoke and burning smell from the fan. The only good thing is that I did if while my car was parked. It should have been disaster if this happened while car was moving..."
3,Too bad the USB port doesn't work,The charger works great when using the regular AC plug. However i've not been able to charge my iPhone via just the USB port. Plug it in and nothing happens. I guess i'll keep charging via the standard AC plug.
1,Has problems handling a laptop with a high capacity battery,"I would think twice before purchasing this product to power a laptop in your car. I travel weekly for my job and sometimes need to power my corporate laptop in a rental car using an inverter. I've had this one for a few months and noticed that it has the same problem described in another review. The power light cycles from green to red (on to off) when plugging my Dell Latitude D630 laptop with high capacity battery into it. The load should be under 150 watts, but this inverter cannot handle it. DO NOT purchase this product if you will rely on it to keep your laptop powered up while on the road."
2,Cobra CPI-150 needs another Cobra,"I bought recenty Cobra CPI-150 to use it with my laptop during the flight. It slowed my computer. Keeps flashing red and green. My computer screen keeps getting brighter and darker. The Cobra keeps switching on and off. Basically, I need something stronger than 150."
1,Did not work.,It did not work. I tried to use it in business class airplane. Wasted money. I do not recommend this at all.
2,Performance doesn't meet specs,I purchased this inverter because the performance specs were 150 watt continuous and 300 watts peak. I was attempting to run a 120 watt laptop. The inverter worked for about 1 1/2 hours on a plane when the laptop was in power saving mode (~90 watts). I then plugged it into my car to test if it would handle 120 watts by pushing on the graphics card. It would not. The inverter switches off and on causing the laptops power management to have serious problems. Towards the end of the car test (~30 minutes) it would no longer recharge the laptop battery and was starting to make a horrible noise. Prior to this purchase I tested a Duracell 813-0291-07 175 Watt DC to AC Pocket Power Source Inverter which wouldn't handle the laptop on a plane (in any mode) but would in the car. I'm I am ready to give up on inverters for a while.From a design perspective the Cobra is nicer than the Duracell.
4,Hello Kitty,"This band is a mix of French and Germans, who sing in five different langauges. Their first record was quirky and decadent, and very over the top. My Melody relies on more subtlety within the band and more cover versions, especially heavy on the Serge Gainsbourg influence. Lead singer, Franoise Cactus is slowly becoming a legend in the international moogcore jetset pantheon. ""Discjockey"" is a danceable song which sound more like the first record, but most of this one is more torch and tragic. For the fans of Franois Hardy and Gainsbourg, this one is for you. Many club people who live for dressing up retro and fuzzy can't seem to get enough of Stereo Total.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"
2,"If you like progressive rock, then the title tells you how to leave this one......","I had to try it. The previous offering from Ten Jinn, As On a Darkling Plain, was an interesting work. This one is pure AOR, and not nearly of the quality of, say, Asia. The first tune, Who Are You, is not bad, but I did not find it getting better from there. I gave up with the 3rd tune. Perhaps I will try again some time, but if you think Asia or Starcastle are not nearly progressive enough for you, you best take a flier on this one. Stick to As On a Darkling Plain and you will not be complaining."
3,built OK ... But...,"This unit looked great, but the plastic is REALLY stiff and makes the door open very hard. There is nothing to keep the plastic seal from sliding out the end. I ended up crimping the alum. frame to hold it in place, but I'd not buy it again."
2,Flash WannaBe,Sony HVLRLAM Ring Light for Sony Alpha Digital SLR is most importantly NOT a Flash unit. It will provide light for close-ups but is not really suitable for anything approaching professional use in macro photography. Its main limitation is the limited brightness of the LED lights. The unit will not permit the use of very small F-Stops that are often desired in macro photography. For hand held purposes about f5.6 is about all that you will be able to use. Too bad Sony didn't continue the previous Real Flash units Konica-Minolta made for macro photography. I'd pass on this unit for anything other than casual home use - maybe for stamp collectors or that sort.
3,Wow you better be a soprano.,"This book is awesome, it has almost all the songs from the movie and then some. The only downfall is that every single one of the songs is written in a very high key. If you can't sing soprano, you shouldn't buy this book. For example, the song ""Over the Rainbow"" is written in E flat. The highest note is a high F. Some of the songs go up to high A flat. Even the songs that the males are supposed to sing are unbelievably high. In conclusion, if you are an alto, you probably won't be able to sing these songs without hurting your voice. If you can't sing soprano, don't buy this book!"
5,Low voltage cable,Perfect for low voltage lighting as long as the wattage is within range.Easy to work with . Worked very well for me.
5,"Adventurous, interesting story","This is a story about a computer programmer traveling in post-war rural Argentina after his bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere. He, being an interesting character himself interacts with many interesting (sometimes weird) people including a rich man looking for an unexisting casino, a fortuneteller, crooked and dangerous priests and an army official who is looking for his lost army thinking they are still at war. It is a captivating story, descriptive and very well written including elements of black humor.It is one of those books that you can read over and over again.Recommended to everyone."
4,Side B of the First CD,"Overall this is not a bad CD. I consider it rather a ""side B"" of his first CD. The songs have the same dreamy melody as in the first release, but that does not mean they are bad to listed to. I like the voice of the lady who sings in most of the songs; her voice is charged with melancholy and lends itself pretty well to FA's guitar playing style."
4,nice size,"nice size, works well so far - very nice lightweight stainless bowl - good value overall at the price point"
2,"Love MADtv, hate this set","Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE MADtv fan and have been for years. It is easily my favorite show of all time. While I loved ""The Complete Season 1"" released in 2004, I think this DVD set is terrible. Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson's Oprah and Mo Collins' Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren't some of the better ones. Who picked this list?Of course I'll still buy it because I love MADtv, but hopefully in time they'll go back to releasing complete seasons again. I can watch a better mix of sketches and episodes for free every day on Comedy Central."
5,MAD!,"I enjoy buying the BEST of collections...The Best of Mad TV is missing the Best ofseasons 2 through 7.Well, where are THOSE?"
3,Just OK.,"Of course there are some good classic skits that I expected to be here (Stuart, Dot, Miss Swan, etc.) but there was less of that than I wanted and expected. The rest of the DVD was filled with so-so material that I could care less about. So I love MadTV and don't regret buying this, but was just a little disappointed."
1,The rest of the series?,"I really enjoyed Season 1 but from the look of this we're never going to see other complete seasons released. Why release the best of Seasons 8, 9, & 10 when you've never released the complete seasons? What about complete seasons 2,3,4, etc. Cabana Chat with Rodney Dangerfield? Phil Lamarr's impressions of Michael Jackson, Prince? Little Hassan Taylor's Greatest Hits? Darlene McBride? Vancome Halloween? The ""Wash me"" video parody of Alanis Morissette? ""Lick my baby back behind"" video parody of Britney Spears? The ""Love muffin"" video parody of Mariah Carey? The Bush Cheney rap video parody. The UBS man goes to the video rental shop, etc.? Afropuffs cereal? The early MadTV was a little savage at times but that's what made it funny. I feel it's appropriate to issue the best after you've put out the complete seasons. Of course maybe there were legal problems. Some of the humor was pretty savage! I guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own."
1,"""Shah. Ya Know What? Unt, unt!""","HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT IS THIS MONKEY PISS!!!I HAVE LOTS OF MONEY TO SPEND AND THIS IS WHAT WE GET?A random so called ""BEST of"" episodes? What they call ""BEST OF"" may be the WORST OF in my eyes or someone else' s eyes.MAD TV made me PEE on myself from laughing so hard!!!!!!It was a CLEVERLY written and HILARIOUS show!!In the words of Al BUNDY. ""GIVE ME WHAT I NEED BABY!""Piss on paying for ""crumbs!!""We want the WHOLE CAKE!! NOW!!"
2,Need full seasons not just the best of!,"This choice to only include some biased ""best of"" clips of these three seasons was horrible. There are many hilarious sketches left out! We need to petition the release of the entire series collection!"
5,Wide ranging collection of hints,"This book is a collection of hints and tips for Mac OS X. It starts with the OS itself, then going into all of the standard applications. It finishes by covering some extensions that you can add to speed up your workflow. The coverage of each application is relatively light because the author expects that you are already familiar with the basics and are ready for some power user tips.Illustrations are kept to a reasonable amount, usually one for every couple of pages, and they are used effectively. The text is a little too jovial for my taste. But it's not distracting and it's a matter of taste.If a Macintosh is your primary work or play computer then you will probably find something in here to help you out. Whether it's worth the money or not depends on how much you find out, so I would take a look at this book in person, or at least browse the table of contents before you buy."
1,look below.,I chose this rating because it couldn't play on my playstation.But i played the game before but it was to damaged to play again so i had to buy a new disc.
3,As good as expected after playing GH3,"After owning and playing GH3 all the way through (first GH game I owned/played) wanted to get GH2 for the different songs. It plays like 3, which I really enjoyed, but the graphics aren't as good (as expected for an earlier game)and the songs are covers (""as made famous by""). The covered songs are still done well, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but I preferred the song list on GH3. If you dig most of the songs on 2, then I would recommend buying it. If not, or if you are wanting to get on GH for the first time, I would suggest starting with 3 or a later one."
1,"Excellent game, misleading description","This is the first time I have ever received something from an Amazon seller that disappointed me.I was looking to replace the copy that I have which was no longer playable due to a scratch on the disc by a friend. The game was listed as used and in ""good"" condition. What I received was a disc so incredibly scratched that my system couldn't even read it. No amount of resurfacing would help, and Gamestop wouldn't take it as a trade. How anyone would have thought this game was playable is beyond me."
3,not pleased,"I sure would of liked this sooner, but the actual item was colorful and fit ok, would of thought it would of fit bigger than it did, its almost made for a shorter person. I think I will buy this item other places next time."
5,Good baptismal coverall,"We use this for a baptismal coverall. It works very well. Hint, sew up the pockets so they do not get full of water when immersed."
5,My Blue Smurf Suit!,"Durable, comfortable, good value. Amazon is always reliable service. In short, no complaints, only good things to report. I enjoy them!"
2,The Boss's big rip-off,"The DVD is mesmerizing. The flip-side should have been this CD. Unfortunately, after paying $23 for this double CD, I was greatly disapointed. The sound quality simply is not very good, and Bruce is not not very smart. I should have saved my money, so I could pay $100 to see him live."
5,medley is the best,bought this for the MF medley. Fantastic! Rest of CD good listening with a traditional seasonal feel while dressing up old standards in a jazzy style. Nice change for the holidays. Merry Christmas.Concord Jazz Christmas 2
2,Sloppy performance in staggeringly bad sound,"It's a cosmic mystery why even a pirate label like Opera d'Oro would release a recording made with the microphone placed right next to the cymbals! This 1970 Manon Lescaut from Verona features Domingo in prime youthful voice, but who can hear him? The sound is distant and murky, and you never know when that crashing cymbal is going to make you jump out of your chair. Magda Oliveiro was the ultimate diva for opera queens, but here she sounds every bit of sixty years old, despite the claim on the cover that she became more alluring in youthful roles as she aged."
3,"Ok, but...","As other reviwers have mentioned, it gives a good overall description of chassis design, but like the first reviewer, I found myself wanting a little more detail. Even some more example graphics of each type of chassis would make it easier to relate the information to the real world. I ended up wanting more information on how to actually go about designing my own chassis (in my case a spaceframe) rather than the broad spectrum of information provided. Maybe I simply chose the wrong book."
3,Not for me.,"Much good has been said about Idil Biret. She's just not my cup o' tea.She has a lot going for her, I'm sure, so it's just a matter of taste,I suppose. I've heard a lot of complimentary things about her frommusic teachers, so I had to hear her for myself. I was expecting anice touch, some fluidity in playing and a nice turns in phrasing. Ididn't hear it."
3,Not sure if it's what I thought I ordered,"I own several Advance Tabco 1/2 sheet pans and they are stamped on the bottom with the Advance Tabco name. I ordered these pans and they are not stamped with the name.. they do have ""Made in China"" stamped only and they are not as heavy as my original pans bought just 2 years ago. I'm considering returning them."
3,turbine ind. 901 rolling nut gatherer,"Works great. Only one thing wrong. They used this very thin aluminum ( I could bend it with my fingers) to hold the wire wheel together. It did not last only a few times rolling it on the ground. The wheel came apart causing me to loose pecans. I fixed it. I had to use two bread ties, one on each side of it to keep the wheel together. After I did this it works real well. But all in all a good product. I suggest to use a stronger metal not this thin aluminum. I thought the weight of the roller was on the heavy side."
1,Invalid Description,"Description states replacement catalytic converter, stainless steel piping. The product received was one 6"" galvanized pipe sleeve, no additional components."
1,I've had better times at the dentist,"There really isn't that much I can say about this movie, my mother always told me ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"". Me and the missus spent the evening in watching this pre-packaged modern art pap. After the first half hour we remained glued to the box in the vain attempt to derive some meaning out of the wasted time that was being consumed. It did not get any better or make anymore real sense, so don't make the mistake we did and watch it until the end. Come to think of it save your money altogether, don't buy or rent the film and get that extra large bag of Flumps you've been hankering for instead."
2,JLo's Madonna Video....,"....if Director Singh himself says that the visuals took precedence over the plot and the storymaking, what else should the viewer do, but turn down the sound and watch the stunning scenes go by? Oh yeah. Get your copy of JLo's CD and simul-play it."
1,Stay away from this one...,"This must easily be the dumbest movie ever made. If one didn't have the pleasure to look at Jennifer Lopez - it would be unwatchable. Unfortunately, the mind of the director works very much like the mind of the perverted serial killer - he enjoys showing a girl drowning in desperate circumstances; and the one moment which would be really interesting to see, where Jennifer Lopez is supposed to connect with the kid, she is all hiding behind operatic costumes... most of the audience walked out of this one, when I saw it in the theatres. Tarsem, the director of the movie, is a world reknown commercials guy. But unlike Spike Jonze, who's in the same commercial league but did not opt to bring amazing but meaningless imagery to his first movie (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH), this director indulges in his images and pays scant attention to story, characters, empathy and believability. Ultimately, it's a forgetable and soon to be forgotten attempt."
4,"Weird movie, good visuals.","This movie was pretty decent, although very dark in theme. What really stands out, however, is the amazing visuals that are in this film. The sequences while Lopez is inside the serial killer's mind are incredible. The film is also back by an equally great soundtrack which really sets the mood in a few places. If The movie is pretty graphic, which I know turned a few people off to the movie. But if you enjoy really eerie and suspenseful movies, this is one for you. I'd probably say that if you liked the movie Se7en, then you'll probably like this one also.The DVD itself is full of extras. New line platinum has done an excellent job here - deleted scenes, cool looking menus, the ability to watch the movie with just the music (I think, never actually tried it though), etc. On top of that the sound and picture transfer is crystal clear, which is a must for a movie like this."
4,Visually Beautiful,"This movie is very visually beautiful. You must be able to have an open mind...since it is all about being in the mind of a serial killer. There are some disturbing scenes, but they're visually creative. As an art student, I enjoyed this movie very much and also it has to do with psychology which I am also a fan of. The only thing that's a slight bummer is the ending..it's OK, and there are little parts here and there that aren't necessary. But overall I enjoy the movie much."
3,Not what I expected,"From the previews I expected this movie to be much more of a science fiction rendition of a Salvador Daliesque fantasy world than another Silence of the Lambs with fantasy overtones. I did enjoy it somewhat, and the fantasy scenes were colorful and well-executed, but at the heart of this movie is a schizophrenic detective movie and I found it to be a let-down; not what I was expecting."
4,Shocking,I saw this movie for the first time on DVD. I didn't go see it because of what I had heard about it. This is a really good movie. It is very graphic and there are some very disturbing sences but it keeps you interested throughout the movie. I especially like it because I studied Pycology and I understand exactly whats happening. It's an interesting view on a graphic representation of the mind. If you like supense and even a little drama you'll like this.
2,The Smell,"Hey What's that smell? Oh I know it's another rotten knockoff of Silence of the Lambs. Now I'd like to start by saying the Effects are all that make this movie watchable, and that grows pretty tiresome by the 90 min mark. The story is pretty basic. The acting for the most part is uniformly BAD. Jennifer Lopez and her whisper are growing mighty tiresome, And what happened to Vince Vaughn?....... I can only recommend this movie if you can smoke a Fatty And enjoy the imagary. If not skip it and Rent the Much Superior Collecters Edition of 7, or The Criterion Collection Version of Silence of the Lambs."
1,Boring flick with no plot and wooden acting,"Someone compared this mess to ""Se7en""??? What? An MTV videoclip is more like it. Boring, boring, BORING movie with ""plot"" consisting mainly of a few ripoffs and a lot of painfully MTV-ish special effects. It could have been better if it weren't for Lopez and her ""acting"". I'd rather watch a marble statue: both its acting skills and appealing are much, much better than those of Lopez. This is the worst movie I've seen this year."
4,"Very strong, very enjoyable","Truely first rate visual effects!Story line was nicely done - only criticism is that they could have taken it a step further.The plot was fine by itself and scarry enough to hold my interest (which is saying something); With that said, I would have liked to see them tie in the fact that Lopez's coma patient manifested the ""boogy man"" and the FBI's serial murderer (with the same rare mental/physical condition) was influenced by an evil 'side'. Both were in comas tied to a rare baterial brain infection contracted in-utero.They could have easily taken this one step further to make the physical illness a manifestation of demonic/evil possession - what interesting and scarry possibilites that would have opened up!At the of the movie, I asked myself - what? it ended? wow! that seemed to go by soo fast!(The ending was logical and timely - I just wished it could have lasted longer.)Well worth watching and seeing again."
2,Visually amazing..otherwise lacking,"I remember seeing the first couple of previews for this movie and just being absolutely amazed and counting the days until is theatrical release. I went to the movie's website thinking ""Wow, this is cool"" and then the big night came and boy was I let down.Visualy this moving is spectacular, amazing, awe inspiring, sometime disturbing, brilliant and any other similar adjective you can think of. Too bad the movie wasn't a silent film. Jennifer Lopez's acting left much to be desired, and the script was just not that good (I am trying to be a little nice here).This movie had a lot of potential and could have been shelved right next to ""Silence of the Lambs"" if they would have just got some better writing and acting.I will probably end up purchasing this on DVD just because visually this movie was so spectacular."
4,"o.k., o.k. . .","so the plot won't change your life ... yeah, J. Lopez is straight out of the Keanu-Wooden-Acting-School ... but the visual imagery is worth the price alone, not to mention Vincent D'Onofrio's terrifying character, who happened to creep me out worse than 'LAMBS and SE7EN put together. I've seen it 3 times, liking it better with each viewing ... seems like a winner to me!"
2,Great Picture - Thin Storyline,"The story is not uninteresting, but not special either. The costumes are great, the picture quality and the surrealistic scenery also. Somehow the movie didn't thrill me."
3,Cool visuals not much else,"The twisted visuals in this film are beautiful and freakish. The visuals are the sole strength of this film everything else such as story, character development and any kind of sympathy for any of the characters, except the killer (not the kid version) well played by Vincent D'Onofrio, is totally lacking, I was hoping they would be stuffed into a slowly filling cell. Jennifer Lopez is, well Jennifer Lopez as if you can expect a star to actually be a good actor get real! Their face material.See this film BEFORE you buy it, its not that good."
4,The Cell Movie,"I saw The Cell three times and each time, I caught things that I didn't see the previous times. Personally, I thought the script was horrible, but the plot was good. The Cell was a bit gory, but it was VERY interesting. I enjoy movies about serial killers, such as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en...The art direction and costume design was great! Tarsem did a very good job. Jennifer Lopez isn't the best actress...I recommend this movie to people who want to see something not ordinarily seen. Again, it has great art and, although it is a bit gory, and the acting wasn't the best, I enjoyed it very much."
2,It ...,"You know, I cannot put it more bluntly than that. The storytelling was ridiculous, the acting (except for Vincent D'Nofrio and Vince Vaughn) was mediocre. The only reson I give it a two is for the special effects. I feel embarrased to have this movie on my shelves, and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."
1,I beg you not to see this,"This is one of the few movies that I think actually deserves one star. I was bored one nigt in the summer and the cell had sounded pretty good in the adds so I decided to see it. Biggest waste of two hours and 5 dollars ever! I could see how the director tried to make it sort a matrix type of cool near the end but the director failed miserably at this. Don't scar your dvd player with this movie, it's the best advice I can give you. In other words please don't see it and it would be even worse of you to buy it."
1,The Cell or my 2 hours wasted,This movie was horrible. I can appreciate a movie if it is mindless fun. This one is just mindless. Stay away from this turkey even if you have absolutely nothing else to do.
1,One Of The Worst I've Seen In A Long Time,"Now, I'm quite a generous guy when it comes to reviewing films, sometimes too generous but this film just... There was no point to it at all. You see, one night I was supposed to be going out with a bunch of mates but that fell through so we went to our second home (the video store) and we rented ""Chopper"" (which was a fantastically gritty film, 5 stars). We also rented ""The Cell"" since it looked cool and none of us got round to seeing it during its cinema release. We watched ""Chopper"" first and loved it, had a break, had some Chinese take-out, had some drinks, then we watched ""The Cell""...and fell asleep! It was so boring! Nothing interesting really happened. We fast forwarded most of it cause it was ""that bad"". And every time the stupid, fat, murderer Carl guy changed into one of those weird Demon Carls he didn't look scary...he looked like Boy George!!! Also, Vince Vaughn is a pretty good actor so what was he doing in this piece of horse..."
1,Repellent and Distasteful,"""The Cell"" is a disturbing film that is extremely violent and exploitive against women.The plot is minimal, the characters not developed, and the dialouge stilted and dull. Jennifer Lopez's talents clearly lie elsewhere, and Vaughn is mediocre as ever.The film is unnecesarily graphic and brutal, and has no humor whatsoever.The psychological aspects of this lurid trash are ludicrous, and apparently we are to believe that smiling excessively and meaningfully speaking the name of your client is the key to unlocking the secrets of the insane."
4,Cheesecake for my eyes...,"I hate Jennifer Lopez, and I really dislike Vince Vaughn, but even they couldn't mess up this visually stunning film. I didn't even need a story- I'd watch hours of the luscious Dali-esque landscapes, flowing ethereal fabric, and twisted Kevorkian-esque creations that make up this film. Plot-wise, it was reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs and serial killer movies in general, with the quintessential devoted cop and house raid scenes. But Vincent D'Onofrio was very good as the creepy villain ""Carl"". Also, the duel personality of the psycho serial killer was painted in such a way that you found yourself siding with him, then hating him, torn between your heart and head at times. A feeling achieved only better in that John Cusack film Identity. I would have liked to have grown more attached to the victim- I didn't really care about her at all, but could stomach her because at least she was smart. But like I said, in a film this palpably visual, you almost don't need a plot..."
4,<VISUALS ONLY>,"Eye Candy. Visually orgasmic. The story has its intriguing qualities such as the psycho killer's methods. But other than that, the story is kind of [slow]."
5,Visual ecstasy,"Maybe it wasn't the best plot ever, but it was such a feast for the eyes! The director, Tarsem Singh, also directed ""The Fall"", one of the best movies I've ever seen."
5,Ignore the bad reviews!! This movie is fantastic!,"The people that gave this movie a low rating likely expected something different than what the movie had in store. I for one believe the dialogue was very well written and I forgot for a moment that Vince Vaughn is known best for playing comical characters. When J.Lo's character plunges into the deep, dark, and twisted mind of the serial killer it's just....very mind-blowing- you get a true sense of events unfolding within a person's mind since it has a very dream-like environment. The movie makes you hate and pity the protagonist throughout the movie, and in the end you realize that what he did was very wrong... but violence begets violence, so it is crucial for children to be in a warm and loving environment. But if all they ever knew in those precious growing up years is anger and violence.... a killer is born."
1,misleading,"It is misleading when your looking for that perfume and get lotion, I guess you need to read what your getting and not go on the picture."
3,Product does the job...,"For a bird feeder and over a 3.75 in deck railing that you don't want to screw into, this is the only product I have found that can do the job. There are some downsides (reason for the 3 *s:- More expensive than most other deck clamps available.- Don't hope to put anything other than a bird feeder on it. Plants are just too heavy for the clamp. It might help to use the optional screw to secure the pole, but if I wanted to screw something into my deck, I wouldn't have bought a clamp!- Hook section attaches onto straight pole and can turn in a strong wind.I don't know if I can recommend this product, but if you have no other options (like me), it might be your best bet."
2,Clamp cracked - cheap Cast Zinc/Alum,"After 2 years I discovered that the clamp was cracked. The part is not covered by warranty and there is no replacement part short of buying a a whole new clamp (msrp $22.99). This part should be stainless steel, not cast with air bubbles in it. I will try wrapping a pipe clamp around it, luckily not visible where my feeder is located."
3,"Good looking speakers, Terrible wire quality","When you buy these speakers be ready to replace the wire given to you. It is very small gauge wiring and has terrible quality,low volume. Replace it with a better wire quality(monster cable) and you will be happier"
2,"cheap material,terrible sound","I was looking for an upgrade for my stereo i got two pairs of Pioneer TS-G1643R 6.5-Inch after 2 days i wanted to replace front pair pioneer with some thing has more bass.Component would be the choice.Good reviews and affordable price made me buy this Hifonics but these are terrible speakers comparing to pioneer.I compared these by installing front right door Hifonics and keeping pioneer on the front left door. i compared balancing right and left .Hifonics are lack of bass and to much treble.high volumes too much distortion .i thought those pair give me a enough bass but after i saw these pioneers are perfect and the bass,acoustic are great too.I don't recommend these speakers as a component."
2,Get What You Pay For,Replaced stock speakers in my Silverado with these. They do not prodice as much bass as the originals and the highs are muddy. One crossover DOA.
2,The Paragon,"It is fairly obvious that John Knowles tried to capture the same success of ""A Separate Peace"" with this novel: New England, war time conditions,adolescent boys, maturity, and school life. But ""The Paragon"" falls far short of ""A Separate Peace."" The same emotion is never quite there. Instead, I felt like I was reading the script to a Sunday night made for TV movie. The thoughts of the main character,Lou Colfax,are overstretched and unintentionally humerous. I almost felt sorry for Knowles at one point in the book. He describes a character as being a worn out writer who only had one successful work attributed to his name. I'll give you a little pity John--2 stars."
1,Does not play DVDs from other devices,"The unit worked fine for me until I discovered that it won't play DVDs recorded on other devices. I tried DVDs recorded and properly finalized on both my IBM computer and my friend's Sony recorder. I used the proper media and tried several different brands, but all I got was ""ERR"". I took these same DVDs to a retail store and they played fine on every brand of player, except for the Panasonic recorders (DMR-ES20 and DMR-ES40).This is a new model and it clearly has a hardware or software problem. I'd stay way from it if you plan to play anything recorded by any other device (like home movies from family members)."
1,JUNK,"I found this product to be a piece of junk. After only short time of use, unit freezes up with all sorts of error messages coming up -- with no solutions!"
3,A bit of fun,"Good movie with a crazy concept,but somehow it works out. It's definitely different...I had a few good laughs while watching it."
2,Not what you would expect...,"Plot in a nutshell- Guy meets his double (""doppelganger"")while working on an ""arm-ed"" wheelchair. Nothing great really happens after that...or before.Advertised from Tartan Asia Extreme. Thought this flick was J-horror but it turned out otherwise, and not very good at all. No ghosts, gore, or anything. Not sure what genre this flick should fall under... Overall not really worth a viewing."
2,Buttons stop working...,"I've owned this remote for almost 4 years now and the volume up and channel up buttons no longer work. As other reviewers noted, they took more and more pressure/time to register until they stop responding altogether. That's pretty unacceptable in a $30 keyboard and outrageous in a $200 remote control.The software that came with the remote was a general PITA to use. It took me a half dozen hours to setup the remote; adding my devices, patching the software, teaching it some devices one button at a time, and then finally programming activities. Despite forum posts on the topic, it was never able to switch to the HDMI input on my television, so I was forced to change the tv input manually whenever I wanted to watch a DVD.Otherwise the remote has worked well. It's battery life was good. The activities concept was intuitive. It felt good to hold. The buttons were logically arranged.Too bad it stopped working."
2,Infuriating volume up button.,"This is my second unit with the same problem. The volume up button wears out and it takes a lot of pressure to get it to work. Also, when I change functions, e.g. from 'watch tv' to 'listen to cds' it doesn't always change over to the correct devices and settings despite being programmed correctly. I constantly have to press the help button. Harmony did do a direct replacement for me but the second unit is doing the same thing.Can someone tell me what alternate brand I can buy?"
5,Great Remote - Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - Refurbished,"Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - Refurbished. $120 for new one. Get the refurbished and the save your money - it looks new to us. Very happy with this remote. Great on-line and over the phone service. Buttons are small, but you get use to them. Highly recommended."
2,Not impressed with the 880,"Could not get this remote to sync with my remotes and just did not work - now have the 520, I believe, and it is wonderful"
5,One of the Best,"I already owned this remote, but I wanted a solution for my upstairs entertainment equipment. I bought the second one and couldn't be happier. I especially like that the device stays charged when not in use (at least if I remember to put it in its cradle). If you aren't afraid to program it, then this is the remote for you."
5,"Great remote, great deal","I already own a 880, and wanted a second one for another setup. I was a little worried about a refurbished unit, but I can't be happier. Works the same as the non-refurbished unit I already own.Love it!"
5,Life changing remote,"A friend of mine recommended this remote as something I absolutely HAD to buy to go with my new flat-screen. Found a great deal on here so I snatched it up, and I'm not looking back. The ease of use is incredible, and the fact that it literally recognizes every component has removed a lot of clutter from the coffee table. The ""help"" button makes problem solving simple, and I don't have to worry about fiddling with input buttons anymore. It's nice to not have the worry of replacing batteries as well. The screen could use a resolution upgrade, but overall I love this little guy."
3,Logitech880,Remote is laid out very well.The remote has troubles performing some of the multi commands scripts to do more complex setups on your equipment.The Help people are extremely good and will work with you to try and get it set right.It's annoying you can't seem to create a backup of settings to go back to when you try to make some new settings.Annoying- All settings have to be changed via Internet links to Logitech with the remote plugged in.MOre complete tutorials would probably save a lot of misunderstandings on how the remote is supposed to work with your system.
1,Refurbished never worked,"We are big Harmony fans and happen to like the 880 a lot. We went through the process of ordering two of these refurbished models, and on both the channel up/down key didn't work.We went and got a new 700 instead.Bottom line: love the products, but the quality control on the refurbished ones seems to be an issue."
1,Difficult to configure and does NOT work with many devices.,"I bought it thinking it would be really easy to configure and that almost any device with remote control will work with it. From 10 devices that I have only one was on their data base. And the manual configuration is very difficult. I would rather bought a much cheaper universal remote control instead of this one that says it is sooo wonderful.If you are thinking to buy it, I recommend to try it before with a friend or store and check if your devices really work with it. It is too expensive for what suppose it does."
4,Successful Transaction,The refurbished control did not operate. The Logitech techs determined that it was faulty and sent me a new one which works very well. They were very helpful to me.Would recommend this control.
5,The only remote you will ever need,"Logitech remotes have yet to let me down. The 880 is no exception, makes operating 5 different devices and switch between 3 different types of activities a piece of cake."
4,Bought Logitech Harmony 880 on refurb from Amazon $45,"Very satisfied... Product was like new except for one issue. The OK button was very unresponsive for the first 3-4 weeks. I actually opened up the remote and fiddled with it. Good news is that it was easy to open and now works perfectly... Worked out for me, but buyer beware."
4,Great deal,"Arrived quickly and was very easy to set up with my monitor, cable, and audio receiver. Ergonomics takes a little getting used to after using the dish network remote( which would not operate my receiver)."
5,Awesome Remote,I absolutely love this remote. It easily controls all the devices in my living room and can be updated with new codes via USB. It is rechargeable and has a long battery life.
5,Great remote,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. I visited him a couple of days later and he had connected it already and was using it for his TV, DVD, Cable box, etc. He said if this remote could control the blinds on his windows he would absolutely program it to do that:))"
2,"1 star to Amazon, 4-stars for the product","I don't want to skew the statistics for the rating cause this remote is awesome.Amazon shipped this remote as promised but after 2 hours of programming and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, it turned out that the remote had a dead IR emitter. But Logitech tech support was very helpful and patient in assisting with the diagnostics and ultimately shipping a new remote.I'm still waiting for it but beware of buying this refurbished item from Amazon"
3,Misleading picture - and only 3 episodes.,"Well, I got what I paid for...The picture on the cover shows Harry Morgan and Jack Webb, in color, from the later years. This one is with the early Webb (about 50 pounds lighter too), and in b/w. They are cool early episodes... but defiantely much simpler (believe it or not) than the later, color episodes."
2,Shock but no Awe,"John Warden has gathered a few stories and other materials to describe two or three interesting, yet rather simple concepts: Determine your desired outcomes, understand the system you are trying to influcence, act on the points where you can leverage your efforts, and drive the process down throughout the implementation engine. Nothing really new. Just a different title. This book is intended to sell his services. It says this is the method. It doesn't say here is how to do this. For the most part I didn't get anything useful to me."
3,Caiman c.s.,"It is best to claim A-Z right away after receiving a stupid answer like you had from Caiman.It is indeed getting messy on Amazon, bad representations and silly mistakes."
2,"Stop sneaking ""messages"" into my light entertainment","There are pluses and minuses to this work from Doug TenNapel. Pluses include a fast-paced story and some truly inventive plot elements, along with what I can only describe as a joyful spirit that infuses the work. The minuses are some thinly-developed characters, an even more thinly-developed romance, and a tacked-on Christian message that neither develops naturally from the story, nor represents one of Christianity's better offerings. If you're a fan of ""Intelligent Design,"" maybe you'll find it uplifting, but I found the author's attempt to sneak that discredited bit of hogwash into what is billed as - and largely is - light entertainment more than a little annoying. Ignore that bit, and ""Creature Tech"" is a decent, fun read."
5,Works great for me,"I don't know about the competitors, but the Infoscan accomplishes all my needs. No more highlighters for me! Now I can take notes in a clean, organized manner. The Infoscan isn't perfect, 'tis true, but it certainly gets the job done. Here's a scanned passage (words in brackets are wrong):If you live [riot] in a major city, you're in a prime spot. Rural areas also have their attractions. Another possible source of people to stay in your bed and breakfast is any national or international corporation near your home. [/roximity] to any kind of tourist attraction is a plus for a bed and breakfast. A home situated near a college, university, or private school can benefit [froze] the considerable amount of traffic that always surrounds an institution of higher learning.As you can see, most of the words are correct, and those that aren't are easily understood (right, Proximity, from). If you follow the directions, which is easy to do, this pen will work wonderfully."
1,Pen Scanner,This pen scanner works but I found out that typing is much faster and a lot more efficient. It actually delayed my work. There must be something better out there--Not happy about this product.
2,Not helpful,"I didn't find this book helpful at all. The author talks of general prinicples and things like always having fresh flowers on the dinner table. Nice, but not everyone can afford to do this. Nowhere does she give any real information about how to implement her principles, which is my pet peeve about these kinds of books. That's nice that these things are generally outlined, but what next? There has to be a happy medium between of ""high ideals outline"" and ""how-to"", this book never gets close."
1,?????,"The commercial for this game was very deceiving. looking at the commercial we thought the bus went on it's own. My 6 year old daughter became very frustrated because there wasn't enough room the move the bus on the board and she also wanted to know what the ""little people"" were supposed to do. She was trying to make the game seem fun for her little brother (3) but suddenly stopped in the middle of the game and said it didn't make sense to her. I felt the same way when I played. The objective to the game is not clear."
1,Extremely basic information. Only for absolute beginners.,This repeats the same exact information througout the book. Never really saying anyting new. The information is very basic. Only of use to you if you have no concept of music and sound. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Great Package,I love the package of this Hardcover collection. Great way to get your hands on the early Deadman stories. If you are a Deadman fan this is a must.This would have been a 5 star review but the newly inked story really takes away from the flow of the stories (kind of like Captain America 112 in the middle of Steranko's run).

4,A nice and fair product,"I had used this mini-computer for one month now and it works fine for me. It took me some time to line-up the magnet and the sensor but no other trouble after that. If you just want to measure the distance and speed, this should do the work for you."
1,Displeased,"Planet Bike Protégé 9.0 9-Function Bike Computer with 4-Line Display and TemperatureIf you want simple, this is not the one. You will need a physicist with a graduate degree, a monkey with twleve hands and a great deal of luck to decipher the directions. I plan on drilling a hole in it and using it for a washer. All I wanted to do was count my miles. Most displeased!"
5,"Lot of info, easy to see and use...one slight issue","At first I thought the ""button free"" feature was a silly gimmick, but making the whole unit, in effect, a single, large button makes tremendous sense. It is also very accurate, based on my biking on a road with mile markers on it.The information that remains static as you cycle through the other screens is the info you need: Current speed, this ride's elapsed time and this ride's ride distance.The additional info you get on the other screens is:First screen: Current temperature and current time.Second screen: Total odometer (since installation of the unit or last total reset).Third screen: This ride's average speed and this ride's highest speed.One oddity that I did not see noted by anyone else: The screen is polarized, so if you are wearing polarized sunglasses, depending on the angle at which you view it, it may appear somewhat dark. It is hardly a reason not to purchase it, but just something to make note of."
5,Very good cyclo-computer at a good price,"First, I must admit that I bought this particular unit by mistake. I intended to buy a wireless and didn't notice that this one is wired. But that turned out to be a non-issue and it actually works better than the Planet Bike Protege Wireless that it replaced.I really like the fact that all the essential data is constantly available.I also appreciate being able to read it without prescription glasses.It snaps off the mount easily so you can stick it in your pocket for security.I used it to ride RAGBRAI (7 day ride across Iowa)and it worked perfectly, except that the included temperature gauge kept reminding me of how insanely hot it was.You might want to protect it with a Ziploc is you're out in the rain at lot."
2,This was great UNTIL,"I really loved this device. It worked great, and it did everything I wanted.HOWEVER, after the battery died (just over a year), I went to get a new one. I replaced the battery, and now it will not work anymore. It works when the new battery is in, but it doesn't connect well, and constantly resets and looses everything. After weeks of messing with it and resetting my information over and over, I had to throw it away."
3,Santa Choosing Roudolph,John Goodman Was The Rigt One to Play Santa I Liked the Movie My Granny Gave me that on Video Are You Going to Have one on DVD in FullScreen ? Hunter
5,Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - the Movie,This is a fun and great movie. My daugher (8) watches this all year and loves it.
5,My Favorite,This Movie Is Good!!I'd Watch This Movie Every Day If I Had It.6 Thumbs ^Up .Whoopi Goldberg Could Have Been Better But I Like It Still.So Go Rent This Movie.
5,Tape Before Cuts,I found this tape to be exceptional. It allowed me to configure thumb and finger protection that was effective and did not impair my mobility or interfere with my wood carving.
2,An almost sweet romantic novel..,"Ethan Hawke's first novel is a sweet attempt in achieving true love at first sight in your twenties while living in New York City. The story starts off very strong and holds your interest until the middle, where its drawn out and exagerated. The end sort of makes you feel flat and empty as if a few more chapters are missing which leads to an unsatisfying end.. Still I will give this actor/author another chance..He has a good heart let's see where his second novel takes me.."
3,"Stick to acting, Ethan","Although a fairly interesting read, The Hottest State reads like the summary of a B-movie. Hawke writes like someone with a hot movie rental, pausing the tape at the end of each scene to write a summary of the previously shown. A fairly charming story, it fails to really get to the point."
1,uh oh,"Noted novelist and essayist Gore Vidal was given a sizable role in the Ethan Hawke movie GATTACA, so I suppose it's only fair to let an actor try his hand at writing a novel. But, good God, don't expect me to like it. I mean, it's not as if Ethan Hawke has a rich literary background like a lot of actors such as Peter O'Toole and the self-educated Jack Nicholson (Lord knows, O'Toole's autobiography shows writing talent). If they wrote novels, they might be worth something. But, Holy Mohican, Ethan Hawke? He can barely act, much less write!!!"
5,A miracle cream!,"This stuff is amazing! I have always had sensitive skin, and from having a newborn and using latex gloves at work I have to wash my hands constantly. In the winter they get so bad my knuckles bleed. I used to be able to use Eucerin, but now when I use it, it irritates my skin. My dad, who has a similar problem, told me about TheraSeal, and I tried it for a few days while visiting him. It was amazing how much it helped, my knuckles healed and my skin is now so smooth, it even helped on my dry elbows. I put it on only in the morning and at night, it also doesn't leave a greasy feeling like Eucerin did which is great! I highly recommend it, I only wish I could find it in a local store so I didn't have to pay for shipping!"
4,Cristal D'Arques Longchamp 11 1/4-Ounce Tumbler,Good product. Gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star because the glasses are a little less heavy/thick as the ones I purchased about 5 years ago. This means they will likely chip or crack a little easier. Wish Cristal D'Arques would have left the quality/thickiness the same as their older glasses and just charged a bit more.
4,Told From the Perspective of Both Persons Most Intimately Involved,"One of the authors was primarily familiar with Wallis Simpson, and the other with the Duke of Windsor. In the early pages, the book is therefore a parallel biography which comes together as they meet and their relationship develops. Very intersting biographical material about both of them, and the circumstances which led British society to oppose the marriage. Writing style could have been livelier and clearer, but on balance, a valuable contribution to an event which caused the British a lot of heartburn in the 1930's and beyond."
1,a waste of effort and money,good consistency and application but my puffiness and small amouht of circling did not respond to treatment.
2,Under eye dark circles,"Under Eye Bryten was not as good as I had expected it to be - quite disappointing in fact! It did very little to reduce eye puffiness and no change to dark circles has been witnessed, however I am not certain this product was produced for black skin so that could be the reason why."
2,Ok,I first saw this movie when I was in high school. I remember it being better than it was. The bright spot throughout this movie is Ami Dolenz.
5,I wish it was on DVD!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this movie so much , I really wish they would put this one on DVD . It's just amazing ... I have thought about this movie for years , I saw a long time ago on HBO , When I was like 8 , and I thought it was called magic beach , but I found it , but not on dvd , this ""SUCKS""....Great movie though."
3,To thick?,I was looking for something that soaks into your hands. This seems to me to be more of a coating that stays on your hands untill you get them wet. Then you end up wipping it on the tpwels. Will probaly not purchase again.
5,The Original Classic,"This too was my first romance book, from years ago. It's still a classic, still one of the best, and probably responsible for most of us continuing to read romance novels... And yes, a lot of thoughts and feelings did seem to be based on what the characters looked like. The other reviewer was right, bad meant ugly, good meant beautiful. I wouldn't have used rape for the story, but since the author did, I will say that she carried us through it well. And ...there's something about this book, several reasons why it's ended up as a long-standing favorite among lots of readers. Maybe it was the day to day life and activities aboard the ship, wondering if the next day would be happy or uncomfortable. I was always interested in what Brandon would say in each scene. The brother Jeff was great and appealing, much more so than in his own story. A great read, one to hold onto, one worth rereading."
1,couldn't stomach reading past page 150...,"I am astonished by all the 5 star reviews for this book. I'm generally of fan of K. Woodiwiss, but I couldn't get past the first 150 pages or so of this book. What I did read left me feeling sick and anxious. As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the male ""hero"" of the story rapes this 17 year old girl 3 or 4 times (despite her loud protestations and the fact that she was violently shaking all over) and he merely laughs and makes fun of her and tells her ""she'll like it eventually."" And we're supposed to cheer this couple on? The ""hero""continues to threaten her after the wedding until the point I stopped reading. I just couldn't continue reading this for entertainment. The most violent storyline of any ""romance"" I have ever read. I'd recommend A Rose in Winter instead..."
2,This book needed some re-working!,"Alright, here are my complaints: The main characters are never fleshed out. Heather is unbelivably gorgeous and unbelivabely BORING!!! There was nothing going on above her bodice! She never comes back with a witty retort or interesting comment.The ""misunderstanding"" love scene in the beginning makes no sense. Then the hero goes from being a complete cad to a wonderful guy(???) There are only two ""love"" scenes in the whole book, one at the beginning and one at the end because the whole middle of the book has the main characters at odds.Not good, need I say more?"
1,This WAS a Parody? Right?,"This had better be a script from ""Saturday Night Live"" or somebody needs to get a grip. I concur completely with the reviewer who calls this ""vomit-inducing"". Rape as a romantic sport? What a concept. Maybe Ms. Woodiwiss should write a lovely romantic novel about Ted Bundy.The writing style? Stilted and stupid. This book would be a good argument to bring back book burning (hey, anyone who thinks rape is a romantic interlude ought not get offended with an attack on the First Amendment). I doubt Ms. Woodiwiss will be invited to speak at the next ""Victim's Rights"" convention. I can't believe any woman would write this. She's got to be a man."
1,THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER READ! TOTAL TURN-OFF,"If you think that an abuduction leading to a flat out rape (no not even heavy seduction here) followed by an extended period of abuse and negligance is romantic, then you will love this book. Personally, it makes me want to wretch. The heroine never fights back. She merely accepts the horrific treatment from the abuser (Oops!) I mean hero Bast-(Oops again!) Brandon. She never even yells! Not to mention that virtually every man, save her brother in law, attempts to rape her. Nice, really. No really. This is exactly what my daydreams are filled with! Please this is disgusting."
1,TRASH.,"Woodiwiss manages to be both offensive and boring with a predictable story and characters so trite they are farcical. The hero and the villain have a lot in common. Both are selfish, cruel and attempt to rape the heroine. The only difference is that the hero succeeds and continues to mentally abuse the heroine for most of the novel. The use of rape as a romantic plot device is disturbing and misguided. a rapist is NOT a hero. The rest of the characters are so trite and stereotypical there is no need for them to ever talk for the reader to guess how the story will unfold. We have the evil, ugly villain; the jealous spurned rival (who is, of course, not as pretty as the heroine); and the wronged, passive, damsel in distress. If you value your time, skip this one."
1,Vomit-Inducing,"My constant mockery of romance novels prompted someone to recommend this one. Let me get this straight. The ""hero"" is a man who rapes a 17-year-old girl and then tells her it's her fault she was hurt? He informs her that she will be his mistress, regardless of her will; later he is enraged that she took away his free choice when she married him? People use this novel as a model for love and look upon this individual as a knight in shining armor, a paragon for all men? Ten pages after meeting him I wanted to jump into the novel and kill him. The fact that a woman wrote this horribly offensive trash just kills me. If you're into the genre at least find a novel whose hero is remotely tolerable."
4,"Give it a chance!!! You'll like it, I'm sure of it =)","Okay, so I wasn't that thrilled with the first two chapters...I thought they were pretty boring, and I just couldn't get into them. BUT, as I continued reading, slowly but surely, the characters developed, and so did my interest in the book. The soliloquys could be a bit much at times and a little distracting, but in a way, they added to the flavor and uniqeness of the novel. A fresh idea, or something that seemed out of the ordinary to me, was Brandon's almost year-long celibacy. This is rare in romance novels and refreshing, because the ultimate moment when Heather and Brandon make love is looked forward to. (in other words, there are not abundant sex scenes) When I finished the book, I missed the characters, just as I always do with books I enjoy."
4,Smell is strong,I like the active ingredients and it works great on cleansing but the scent in the product is way too strong. Very peach and very smelly. I wish they made an unscented version.
3,Peter Thomas roth Complexion Correction Pads,"I've used this product for about 6 months. I do like the pads, however did not really think that I needed them with using the anti-aging moisturizer. Just another expense that I decided was not worth it."
2,kewl title tho confusing....,"loved the use of vibrant color and the bizarre use to convey emotion, needed a chart to correlate... just wondered how Mr. Dean had the prescient knowledge of evil to come... things were pretty crazy to begin with at the start, being that isolated (??) didn't seem that way with all those patients, etc., makes one mad and desirous of one hug a day??? oh well, kept on wanting to hear more about the darn flower that compelled one to enhance the senses, night blooming jasmine, one little hint, K? big takeaway from this is how absolutely stunning Deborah Kerr is sans hair and makeup...just gorgeous!! I got confused with all the winds, drums, and crazy eyes, so my review is rather limited... sorry Marty this one is over my head!"
2,Waste of Time,"This book really was not that exceptional, even from the beginning. But heck, I paid (price) for it, so I thought I would go ahead and finish it. That was a mistake. The ending was absolutely stupid. It was as if the author came up with 5 possible endings, wrote them on slips of paper, and stuck them in a hat. This ending was on the slip of paper he pulled out. Too bad that it was the worst ending out of the five. I could think of 10 more satisfying and intelligent endings than this.Apart from the ending, everything else about this book fails. The suspense (well, what little of it there is) really doesn't lead up to anything. It just kind of fizzles out when you think it's going somewhere.The characters aren't that interesting. Freedy made me chuckle a couple of times, but he wasn't any more memorable than a character anyone else could have created.All in all, it's a bad book. Don't waste your time."
3,Feels rushed,"Have you ever seen a movie that felt like something was missing? Where you got the distinct feeling that something crucial was left on the cutting room floor?You may well get that same feeling with ""Crying Wolf."" The setup is fine; but everything comes together so quickly, it almost feels like Peter Abrahams was over budget and under pressure from a film studio to get this one in the can.Perhaps he was trying to create unrelenting suspense, which is an admirable tactic--but the end result just feels slightly unfinished and hurried as a result, as if his heart isn't really in it. ""Crying Wolf"" was OK, and it held my attention, but it left me feeling naggingly unsatisfied."
3,decent but that is it,When I bought this product about a month ago I was a beginner jump roper. I have been practicing with it about 5 days a week for those 4 weeks and have become pretty good to this point. I have noticed that when I began to speed jump the rope by one of the handles started to wear halfway through the leather and is about to break. The rest of the rope has held up well except for the area near the one handle. The friction caused by the handle is tearing the rope. I would recommend the rope for those who do not jump for speed. But since my goal is speed jumping I am currently looking for another rope.
4,Solid product.,"Not much to say about this item. It's a decent rope and works for my needs. Only problem I've had so far is the wooden handles up at the top where the rope sticks out is a bit brittle. I dropped the handles a few times outside while using and a big piece of the wood chipped off. Wood glued it back together and so far it's fine though. Was a little bit frustrated at the time though but all in all it's a good item.Edit 12/13/10: Unfortunately after dropping the handle a few times, it broke on several occasions. The final time I dropped it, it broke as far as to the rope coming out of the handle entirely, making it pretty much unsalvagable. The wood handles of this rope are rather flimsy, made of a very light weight wood. Not upset about it but next time I'm going to go with a plastic handle jump rope."
3,Good but extremely difficult to shorten length,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who is a gymnast. She thinks it is a fine jump rope but unfortunately it is too long.Pros: ball-bearings help to make this a jump rope that is easy to useCons: difficult if not impossible to shorten the length because of the special pin/clamp that seals the rope into the handle. It would have been handy to provide a special tool to do this.
3,Perfect lightweight jump rope...for midgets! :-P,"I kinda sensed that this jump rope would not be as amazing as it looks! I still got this anyway because Everlast makes mostly boxing equipment so I figured this jump rope would be ideal, but it's wayyyyyy too light-weight and the 8 ft model actually feels short...even for a semi-midget like myself. I'm 5'6"" but the rope still gets tangled up. So I would recommend the 9.5' model if you really want this jump rope. You can shorten it to your ideal length. The wooden handle is nice.The jump rope does looks great! Makes you feel like you're a boxer...until you get all tangled up in it, then you feel like a douche!So after this, I think the heavier weighted ropes make for better work outs! I'm just going to return this one and get maybe the Nike Weighted jump rope. I'll be that jackass calling for help when the rope is strangling me, however! :)"
3,Fair,"The decanter looks pretty good if you aren't expecting fine-quality crystal. It is a serviceable decanter at what I consider to be a good price. Be aware, however, that the stopper is plastic-wrapped where it fits into the neck of the decanter - probably good for creating a seal but you can see that it is plastic coated and not my cuppa. I did not expect it to be finely ground but did not expect plastic, either. Other than that, it is okay for the price but not for me. I would use this decanter for mouthwash - would look good in the bath and the seal is tight."
2,Not a lot of info,"The DVD was not what I expected. IMO, it was more of a ""highlight"" video of him catching bass. I thought it would show more kayak bass fishing techniques and other information related to kayak fishing. The DVD didn't even come in a nice DVD case. It seems like the DVD was just a ""boot-leged"" copy of some original.The production of the DVD was just average at best."
4,My favorite fishing DVD,"I have a ton of how to fish DVDs and this is my favorite. Ken is down to earth and enthusiastic. There is plenty of footage of him landing monster bass. Content is a little light on the tips and techniques but still, overall, this is a great introduction to kayak fishing."
5,Sony DSC S-85 - A Keeper,"This camera has made me a better photographer.It is easy to use and has an on-screen menu for changing options quickly. You can set this camera to automatic, or you can use it in aperture-priority, shutter priority, or manual mode.The truth is that this camera has so many options that I haven't explored all of them yet, though I've owned it almost a year.It is a real keeper."
1,Very slow working,"I had this camera one year ago, but sold it away by half price. S85 works very slow, and it's impossible to made very quick shot - it's impossible to cath the moment. Also, this camera is very unhermetic - I found a wool nite or hair between lenses - and do not have reason, how it get there. Now I have F717 - the right choose. Forget about S85 - it's one big mistake of Sony."
1,I stopped reading here.,"I had high hopes for Biggest Elvis, since Nancy Pearl recommends it so enthusiastically in ""Book Lust."" Although I have no complaint with the quality of the writing, I found this book to be a downer in a big way. Kluge makes living in a military base in the Phillipines seem to be one grade removed from hell and I don't want to read about hell. Sorry. When I reached page 140 and realized that, despite some hanging plot threads, that I really didn't give a damn what happened to any of the characters, I forced myself to return ""Biggest Elvis"" to the library.I don't know if any ""Father Ted"" fans will read this review, but if there are, I'll say that I had a vague hope that ""Biggest Elvis"" was the inspiration for the ""Three Stages of Elvis"" episode of the Father Ted TV series. Having read nearly half of ""Biggest Elvis,"" I can't say I see anything in this book that could have led to the Father Ted show, other than the notion of Elvis appearing on stage in each phase of his career."
2,A good idea but a mediocre book,"Vandana Shiva writes on a worthwhile topic, namely the fact that the dominant economic and legal systems are totally unequipped to deal with environmental reality and have a wildly destructive tendency to impose themselves on the rest of the world. However, this book is sadly too incoherent and poorly written to properly convey the immediacy of this issue. Her arguments are totally lacking in structure and are prone to rediculous, hyperbolic rants about the colonization of the womb and other paranoid fantasies. She cites plenty of sound evidence throughout, but in an equally haphazard fashion. All in all, I guess it is worthwhile to read this book simply because there aren't really any others on the subject, but don't let the fact that Shiva writes like one of those borderline schizo activists turn you off to the importance of the issue of biopiracy."
1,This deal hasn't been sealed,Andre the Famous Harbor Seal is a lot better. This book is a failure in comparison.
5,Sammy the Seal,I bought this book for my grandson. He is beginning to read. He really enjoyed this book!
1,Boring and poor concept illustration.,"I bought this book about one year ago. It is so boring that I only finished 2/5 of it until now. I find it extremely boring and the authors have very poor skill in explaining the technical concept and the basic of Flash. Until now, I do not know how to create a simple Flash animation for my website.The authors have also put in the book the details of each commands. But as a whole, how to implement them? I find that it is more like a reference book for each command, rather than a step by step teaching book for beginners.I have more than 2 dozens of such computer books in my room. So far, this one is the worst.I have to shop for another Flash book tomorrow. But now, it is Flash 5."
1,TREATS U LIKE AN IDIOT!,All this book does is basically explain how to use Paint. Uknow the program that comes with windows. YEs you herd me. IT tells uhow to make text boxs oooooo. And how to make square and stuff. Wow i spent 30 bux on a book that taught me how to make squares. I do not reccamend this book to anyone.
3,Missing Critical Details,"This book is basically the same information that is available via the manual and the online help for Flash 4, and Macromedia makes lousy manuals. ""Flash4! Creative Web Animation"" tends to leave out key pieces of information, such as when using variables, what type (eg. alphanumeric, boolean, etc...) are the parameters (and the results)? Or, when using Drag Movie Clip, what exactly is initiating the actionscript (ie, mouse on what, exactly)? So far, I have seen some great books for advanced Flash, but not for the beginner or intermediate levels, and no really good reference materials. Hopefully the soon-to-be-published Flash 4 Bible will change all that."
1,Beginners Only,"This book is great for beginners, but for anyone with even a passing aquaintance with Flash 4 this book is useless. The book rehashes the content in the Flash 4 User guide. The files on the CD are anemic and the only one that is even mildly interesting (Whack a Mole) has no documentation. This book is useless as a reference manual because it offers nothing more than can be found in the manual that came FREE with Flash."
2,Not as good as I thought,"""Derek Franklin wrote an excellent tutorial online for animated button creation; but I didn't find the CD based tutorials as understandable as the online tutorial."
3,A decent guide for intermediate flash users,"I found this book to be very useful for about 2 weeks. when I bought this, I was a novice in flash, but an 'advanced' novice. This book helped me learn the very basics of interactivity and actionscripting, but doesn't really go beyond that. If you want to get through the basics and begin to touch on some of the advanced topics, this is a great book."
3,"Good book to start with, but lacks detail in more advanced a","This is a great book to start with, and the book is well designed and thought out, in terms of making a complicated subject easy to start. Its layout is easy on the eyes to read, something many technically orientated books could learn a lesson from. However, in exploring the more detailed depths and possibilities of Flash4, the book is sorely lacking. Definitely recomended to start with, but look elsewhere for use as a reference manual."
3,The manual with a pretty cover,"Oh give me a break! It took me a few minutes of digging through the pages but I finally realized that there wasn't anything in it. If you refuse to read the manual and have nothing better to do with $ then by all means, buy this book. If you have read the manual and feel that you would like to learn some new stuff, don't buy the book. I learned 2 new tricks from this purchase and both of them were from the CD ROM, not the book and were not worth my money. I can not give the manual a terrible rating and since they give you a new, pretty cover with it I'll give it 3 stars."
3,Good but not great,"I learned alot from the information in this book, but since it didn't 'combine' all the things together in a normal way it's hard to use it in your own movies. Like said before in a review the chapters are all screwed up. If you're new to Flash 4 you'd be better off by taking the lessons. (Help>Lessons)"
2,not yet,"My son is an intelligent three year old who loves Bob the Builder but for some reason this game just hasn't clicked with him at all - maybe when he gets a little older?... The past reviewers said that it was fun for all ages which is why we purchased it for Christmas; however, it just seems boring to me and my son. Maybe if there were other kids his age or older to play with..."
4,DYNA GLIDE MANUAL,THIS MANUAL IS VERY INFORMATIVE WITH PICTURES SHOWING PRECISELY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.IT BREAKS DOWN ALL THE DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF A CERTAIN MODEL & YEAR.
5,Good mount,"Bomber construction. Installed with 2.5 people no problem, mounting hardware was fine for us. Great TV mobility installed."
4,Probably the best recent single volume Darwin Biography,"My title probably says it all, but I will elaborate. I still think that janet Browne has made the best START to a biography, I just wish she would finish by giving us Vol. 2! In the meantime we have Bowlby and that isn't half bad. Full of interesting background material and written with a lively pace A NEW LIFE manages to steer through some of the perils of ""psychohistory"" that have damaged other authors and gives us an interesting and at times provocative look at Darwin and Darwin's time. Well worth the read."
5,Awesome Glass,"As a photographer, this is a lens everyone should have in their bag of tools. This lens is amazing and the pictures are ""tack sharp"". A great product I would highly recommend."
4,this is a very good lens. deserve to have it for lifetime,"this is a very good lens. deserve to have it for lifetimedefinitely, every one should have one to match his canon DSLR"
5,Best value for L series,This is my first L lens and I must say it was worth every penny. Super sharp at f/8 and nice bokeh as well. Took this to the zoo and love the results. Great general purpose lens for outdoor shots. Can't see paying twice as much for one extra f stop. Auto focus is super fast and IS is a life saver! Read every review before I purchased and never regretted it.
5,One great lens.,"I've bought this lens to shoot concerts and soccer outdoors, among other things. It is not possible to use tripod while shooting concerts and other events and besides it is just fun to shoot handleld. This lens is expensive: about twice the cost of non-IS version, but this one is a real great lens ang great fun to use:- can get reasonably sharp images with up to 1/10 seconds exposure! The IS is real that great! With 1/60 sec exposures the images is always sharpat 200mm.- Just a little bigger than the consumer 75-300 zoom- Great optics.- Weather sealed.- Ring USM focus motor- focuses fast!- Handles real great on my EOS 10D."
4,super lens,"Waited for weeks before purchasing since it is a big chunk of cash, for me. Great photos from this lens on my 7d. Easy to hand hold so, I carry this combo everywhere. Still becoming accustomed to the possibilities offered but, thrilled almost all the time."
5,Excellent carry lens,"Very very sharp. Fast focus, much faster than most none L lens. Quiet focus. Light enough to carry long term."
2,Lots of information but poorly written.,"This could have been a 5 star book. The book is packed with very interesting and well documented information. However, the book is riddled with errors. I found so many spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors that the book was actually painful to read. I could not read 2 pages without finding a word missing from a sentence. I can only assume that the book was not edited before publication. Without these problems, this book would have been great!"
5,The future in the past,"The current leaders of Russia and the other parts of the former USSR are a different name for the same old group of bureaucrats that muscled their way in under Stalin. Workers, oppressed nationalities, women have to fight them at every step to preserve the gains won during the workers revolution in 1917, to move forward for a decent life. The words of these Bolshevik fighters who refused to let Stalin and his successors stop them from defending the revolutionary ideas of Lenin and Trotsky, their words, and example and struggle will be come weapons for the new generation of fighters in these countries."
1,????????,"i got this game for my birthday. i have two brothers older than i am. they love brain games. we played this game for hours. the challenges were easy. the hardest one was red, red,red,red,green. tricky huh? the nest day it broke. we put in brand new batteries and nothing. my parents were still wondering why they bought it."
1,Very Poor Quality. On first Use Side tore.,"Although the top of this pad seems pretty good, the sides are made with a very thin poor quality fabric. Mine tore along one of the rows of stitching the first time I tried to put it on the bed."
3,just ok mattress pad,This was just an ok pad..not very thick but but the elastic around the bottom was very good and was a good fit.
1,DO NOT BUY unless you want a disposable mattress pad.,This mattress pad began to fall apart after the second wash. Even though it was inexpensive it certainly should have lasted longer than a few weeks.
5,Just what I wanted.,I was very happy with the deep pockets on this mattress cover since I have a pillow top.
1,do not buy,This product was a complete dissappointment. Very poorly made and sides stretched out just by taking it out and did not spring back into shape. This has been the first item I had to send back.
2,Common Knowledge in a nicely packaged pretty book,"This might be a nice book for a recent grad first starting out in the corporate world or for someone who has just experienced some negative work experiences, however the advice offered seems to be really common sense tactics that most people are already aware of."
5,Administrative Aide in Los Angeles,"My boss received an advanced copy of Dr. Kaye's book - and since he was out of town, I took the book home to read for myself. Let me just say ""WOW""! What a quick, enlightening, and motivating read! I now see how I can take steps toward growing in my present position, and not risk ""jumping from the frying pan into the fire"". Thanks to the authors: they have helped me rethink my career objectives to grow right where I am!"
4,I'm honoured to be able to listen her music,She was named the 7th most beautiful peson of the world. Take a listen & you will understand.
1,Worst Album ever!,"A friend of mine from Australian turned me on to Kylie. She's supposed to be the Pop Queen in Australia. Anyway, after buying this album, I think she is a talentless singer who only became famous because of her looks. This is a total waste of time and money, and I regret buying it. Worst album ever! Can I give it 0 stars?"
5,Medifast Safe and Great Tasting,"I was shocked at how great this stuff tastes and what shocked me even more was how great all of the Walden Farms products taste. When I first started Medifast I ate everything sweet and after just a few days of being on Medifast I learned how great all of their stuff tastes. I was shocked that food this good was so healthy.I have tried all of the salad dressings and have liked them all.Walden Farms Creamy Bacon Salad Dressing Packets - Six 1 oz. packets per boxWalden Farms Honey Dijon Dressing, Sugar Free, Calorie Free, Fat Free, Carb Free, Gluten FreeSalad Dressing Ranch 12 fl.oz"
1,Poor quality,"It worked fine the first 3 times I used it. Then the blue light on the adapter started to flicker. If I wiggle it while it's connected to the computer it keeps flickering but does not stay on. So, it's completely useless now. I know it's not my computer. I've tried it on 4 different USB connections.The functionality is fine. The hardware quality is very poor. I would never buy this brand again."
2,Angry and bitter,"I'm a fan of the Wilder series, but this book makes for a sad and bitter postscript to that hopeful and optimistic work. It may be realistic, and, worse, it may authentically reflect Wilder's thoughts, but boy is it a bitter, sad and frustrated rejection of what is most appealing in the earlier books. I guess you have to read it if you are a Wilder completist, but unless you are willing to darken your rosy memories of the early books, I would avoid this."
3,A Different Approach,When I read this book I was a little dissapointed. The magic and warmth That was in Laura Ingalls Wilder other books was missing from this book. I understand why but I still was dissapointed. A sad feeling crept upon me when I read this book.
4,Every Tune is a Winner,"I had to give this one a 4/5 starts because I had to listen to it about 75 times before it finally got hooked into my brain. That's partially my fault because I have to be at the right place in my life for certain music to have meaning to me.But the songwriting on this CD is fantastic. Lyrically, I love the different takes on life shown in the song, ""Butchers."" ""Write Me Off"" sounds as if it could have been pulled off of Soul Asylum's ""Hang Time"" if Bob Mould had crafted the lyrics and sang the song himself. The lyrics are clever.The cover of ""To Love Somebody"" fits in nicely with the other material topic-wise. The use of piano/organ is nice as well. The overall feel of the album is pleasant and rocking, usually in different spots.I would recommend this album if you enjoy great lyrics and medium-tempo rockers. This is a great soundtrack for small towns in the midwest, especially around the Oklahoma area."
4,Loud but not lousy,"Shame on me for not liking this band just because of their stupid, ugly-sounding name... But, well, what can you do? It's a dumb name. Smart band, though -- this isn't the rowdy, sloppy twangcore you might expect... not exactly. Rather, what we have here is slick, melodic power-pop masquerading as cowpunk. The gravel-voiced vocals pay back-handed homage to numerous croony growlers of the neo-Tom Waits school, and while the roughness of the guitars is more exaggerated and louder than need be, I'd have to say this is a pretty skillful mix. A rock music comparison might be to the pop-punk balladeers in the Smoking Popes -- faux ugly vocals distracting us from musical craftsmanship that might otherwise be deemed too ""perfect"" for the genre... This isn't entirely my cup of tea; I think they're overdoing it a bit, and personally I don't find the record that pleasant to listen to. But if you want something that's rugged but not brainless, this is a pretty good record."
1,Wish I could rate it 0 stars,What kind of monitor wipes leaves the screen dirty with streaks and residues? The purpose of the wipes is to clean the monitor not make it more dirty!I wasted money buying this crap. I thought dust-off was a good company until I used this crap.
1,Garbage. Horrid streaks and adds piles of lint,These wipes are garbage.1. They're toxic. The smell gives me headaches and if you get it in your eyes it says to flush them for 15-20 minutes. That's TOXIC.2. They leave streak like crazy - my monitor looks like mineral water was poured on it and left to dry.3. Piles and wads of lint EVERYWHERE. The visibility of my monitor has been reduced it leaves behind so much lint.4. Gently rubbing with a normal wash cloth and distilled water worked great. No streaks. No fingerprints.I also left an email to this company about the lint and got no reply. These are junk made by people who don't care.
5,Masterpiece,"awesome i ws expecting just a typical dumb horror movie but this was one of the best storylines iv ever seen ever and iv seen nearly every movie,great 10/10."
3,Different from what I expected,"Saw was interesting. I think I was expecting a more senseless out-and-out gore fest and while it is gorey, it pretends to have higher aspirations. That is actually what kind of diminsihed the film's fun factor for me. The whole theme about appreciating life, the cat and mouse intrigue were fine - actually it then raised my expectations for the film. The problem is that after that, the script gets a little sloppy. The ending is quite frustrating and just a little too silly given the greater depth they had hinted at earlier. Some fine scary moments and supsense are guaranteed however.Elwes' real accent keeps slipping out toward the end as his anger and fustration mount and numerous folks have pointed out the kill-him-while-you-have-him gaffe that occurs multiple times. Both annoying factors as the film moves along. Still, it can be a fun ride for thriller people."
4,A review of both the film and DVD edition,"I am a fan of Saw. Some say ""gore-porn"", some say original indi thriller. This 2 disc DVD edition is a great own for a collector of film and saw fans alike. I gave this 4 out of 5 due ONLY to the fact that the case itself is easily breakable. Like Saw? Do you buy every movie you see? This is a great addition to your collection... just don't drop it."
3,its gorey,"if gorey is what your looking for then this is it.if plot is what your looking for then it seems like this movie is a lot like the plot of another by the name of ""SEVEN""its not like a clone of SEVEN but in ways its the same.i also hated the ending if you have one bullet you shoot the pad lock... duh"
5,ONE OF THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT HORROR FILMS OF THE DECADE!,"""SAW"", Is one of the smartest, mostintellegant and well thought out filmsof the modern day (American) horrorgenre, like most american horror filmsat this point in time it loads up onthe blood & guts BUT, what alot ofpeople dont pay any attiontion to isthat their is a much more deepermeaning than the basic blah, blah,villian cuts a little hear, maybe alittle their yada,yada so on and soforth. ""SAW"" takes you on a wild andbrutally insane roller coaster extra-vaganza that will keep you wonderingfrom beginning to end ... not tomention a .... KILLER ending...Grade: Somewhere between a B+ and an A-"
3,a little stupid,"When i got saw, i thought ""Finally, a gore fest in a movie!"",but there isn't a lot of blood in it. That was a dissapoinment.The story is completley dumb. I thought that the puppet was the killer. But it's some retarted fat bald guy. If you want a gore fest, this will dissapoint. First when you see it, you will want to close your eyes beacuse you dont want to see brutal, gory murders, dont, nothing will happen, it will censor it by going to another scene. Thats just stupid. Rent it."
3,Wish I hadn't seen this...,"As I'm going to have nightmares for the rest of my life.Definitely the most traumatizing and sickest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.Whomever the writer is, however, is a genius because he definitely gave us a lesson in a sick and twisted way."
2,Disappointed (2.5 Stars),"I thought the story itself was really good and really interesting, however, I thought the acting was lacking. It did have some intense and suspenseful moments, but not as many as I was hopping for. I also wasn't scared at all, which really suprised me seeing as how the commercials looked really spooky. All in all I was very disappointed!I did like how the movie ended, though."
2,Nothing Special,"This movie was very run of the mill. Unless you still think speeding up the camera and fast editing are cutting edge, It reminds me of recent MTV videos. The worst part was the acting, I love the princess bride guy (Cary Elwes) but man was he bad, to his credit some of the lines he was given were absurd. The Writer of the movie (who played opposite him) was actually pretty good, but i guess its becuase i knew he wasnt a real actor so i gave him some slack.The movie starts out good enough, but it never ever hit the stride that told me it was going to be a hit, or even a cult hit. Maybe i should have given it 3 stars but i gave it 2 because i had to counter all those people who gave it 5 stars (The Godfather deserves 5 stars, not SAW!)Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd could easily have been cast.Oh, And i do get the point of the movie, although it still does not help."
1,Cheesy,"This movie had very little plot and definitely was not scary. It was so cheesy, there wasn't even any good laughs. The acting was really, really bad. Skip it."
3,nothing special,i thought that it was going to be more bloody than the SAW movie was. It was or at least I didn't think it was. The only cool thing was the case that the movie came in. the front is like a bag of some sort with blood in it and a jigsaw that floats around. really cool. not sure if it's worth the exact money for this version of the dvd.
4,No Gore,I heard this was a good film through some friends and considering it was the week of halloween I thought celebrate with a good scary movie. I don't really care for movies that have a gotcha or someones going to getcha theme. This really played into the mind I figured out almost right away who the guy was but I really liked it any way. In fact the point of the movie is to make you appreciate your life. I got out of it what I needed a little scared but not grossed out by blood.
5,Saw Rocks,"Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero. 2 men (Elwes, Whannell) are shackeled broken down bathroom. Dr. Gordon has to kill his cellmate Adam or his wife (Potter) and daughter (Vega) will die.Tracking down Jigsaw is a dectective name David Tapp (Glover) and his partner Steven Sing (Lueng).This film also stars Dina Meyer as Detective Kerry. Shawnee Smith as Amanda. And Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle. This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. For them to survive, they have to go through his deadly games.Performances are very good, some over the top, but very good. The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.This uncut edition really has no extra scenes, just an extended scene of Amanda finding the key inside a man's body.Saw is a must-see horror film. And it's sequel is even more awesome."
5,Better as a Whole,"Okay, so it was made on the cheap but with SAW, director James Wan shows he's got what it takes to make his mark on Hollywood. Oh yeah, and the $18 million opening weekend on a film that only cost about one million doesn't hurt either. With SAW it isn't the nominal stars that matter, it is the STORY. Credit an imaginative screenplay with plenty of reversals at the end. Now I know why the production company is called Twisted Pictures, the movie twists and twists and twists. A lot of people have called these plot developments implausible, I prefer creative. With the success of SAW I bet we see the return of the antagonist-who by the way when revealed is truly creepy- in SAW N-2. Jigsaw is destined to join Freddy, Jason and Michael Meyers in franchise heaven."
2,"gag me, kill me, do something to put me out of this misery","OK! i'll be the 1st to say i wanted to see this movie more than anyone and me and about 8 friends went opening night all worked up into a frenzy over this supposidly horrorfying movie...it did absolutely NOTHING for me. It wasnt a total waste of the 8$ i spent to see it (the 2 scenes where the girl with long black hair came out of the guys car, and attacked him in the closet ((closely resembling the grudge)) were very good and the death scenes at the begining were good ((the barbed wire and glass)) yes, this movie had the potential to be something much more) i shuttered about 3 times and the rest of the time i found myself laughing at the total idiocity of this movie! This is one of the could have, would have, and should have movies...It wasnt THAT bad...but i dont plan on renting or owning it any time soon..."
2,So this is what passes for horror nowadays?,Waste of 2 hours. Cult and now mainstream classic my butt. Don't be fools for the hype. It's just a crappy movie.
1,This Movie Sucks!,"This movie is about some crazy guy nicknamed Jigsaw who kidnaps people and tries teach them lifes values, by putting them through sick twisted games.What the heck is that all about?!It is nothing but blood and gore throungh the whole movie! If I could give this movie 0 stars I would,it sucks!"
1,"""Saw"" is badly overated","""Saw"" is a badly acted movie with spotty writing and odd direction. The characters aren't believable and the twist at the end is even more unbelievable. Nothing rings true, unless you like gore for gore's sake.This is not a horror movie in my opinion. It's simply a horror."
2,very frustrating,This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies that I've seen in a long time. What mother would let a man put a gun to her child's head and then hesitate to kill him when she finally gets the gun in her possession? I found myself yelling at her to shoot him a million times and I don't even have to tell you what happened next because it was far too predictable. I was still angry after watching it because I know in real life that nobody could be so stupid. There are far better suspense thrillers out there to watch and I'm upset that I had wasted my money on this one!
5,Saw,Its been a long time since a good mystery movie came out. The characters were interesting and made you think. The ending will always be remembered as a huge twist that no one saw coming.
1,Baw haw haw haw,I've heard of this guy before. Check out his mental furniture before you let him work over yours.
5,Amazing,I am madly in love with these great flasks. I used them for a vodka infusion project for holiday gift giving & they're the perfect size for sharing! I'll be placing more orders in the future without hesitation.
5,Man's (or Woman's) Best Friend,"I love this bottle. My friends are all envious. The only downside is that it's a bit heavy- it wouldn't fit into a jeans pocket etc. Most flasks nowadays are cheap novelty junk that are made of low-quality metal and will turn your booze green. This flask never leaks and holds enough hooch to get me through just about anything: power outage, 2nd string pastor's sermon, or even one of my girlfriend's Jane Austin movie marathons. After 8.5 ounces of fine Kentucky bourbon, you too will agree that Mr. Darcy is a splendid prospect for marriage!"
4,Great table - lengthly assembly,We love the table and it seems sturdy to hold up to our four boys. Wedid not realize how many pieces it would arrive in - it was a good four hours for assembly. Now that it is together - we are thrilled. Sturdy and love the spot on the sides to hold the rackets and balls.
4,infusion,"doesn't seem to pump too well. air seems to get out little by little somehow, but the product was sent to me in new condition and i'm satisfied."
4,How To Survive Peer Review,"In Elizabeth Wager, Fiona Godlee, and Tom Jefferson's How To Survive Peer Review, they provide a concise guide of the peer review process in academia. Subsequently, readers learn about different kinds of peer review, explicit instructions for being a peer reviewer, and the importance of maintaining quality of scholarship within various disciplines. Overall, this is a very helpful book for comprehendingan integral component of intellectual life."
2,Panty has bars that are shown too much,The Panty has 4 bars (.2 '' of approximate width) that are shown too much and easily it can be distinguished that a strip of this type is using
2,Looks better than it is.....,You expect each of the tools in the Kit to be of decent quality...most of these are not.....better to purchase individual tools of better quality...which is what I now will do!....case is ok to hold the replacement tools you purchase.
2,Fun for the first hour but...,"Great fun for the first hour of play, second game was almost all repeated words, by the third game we knew every word/phrase. Not worth the money."
5,A definite two thumbs up!,I have never had so much fun with a game at a party! It was the biggest hit there and everyone played from little kids to older adults! One of the great things about it is how easy it is to learn how to play and how there are few rules! But by far the best part is that it's not the usual board game where the box falls apart and you eventually lose all the pieces... with CatchPhrase you only have one durable unit to carry around!********5 stars all the way around!*****
4,catch phrase game,"The game arrived as ordered in a timely manner. I don't recall reading this, but it requires a minimum of four players. I bought it for my two grandsons without realizing they would need at least two other players to comprise two teams. Otherwise it's a great game."
2,wow! you'd think with an electronic version there'd be more clues!,"We used to play the card version and there were way more clues then this new version, and they come out in the same order every time if you can believe that. If they are going to take the time to make it electronic, I think they should have put a lot more clues and they should be randomized. 1000 may sound like a lot, but two rounds through each category and you've been through them all. Great game while it lasts, but c'mon Parker Brothers, don't skimp next time!!"
5,Great fun for any get-together,"I first played this game at a friend's house as after-dinner entertainment for a group of adults. We ended up playing for hours. I then bought the game for my own family, and we played it for hours at Christmas. This is a very straight-forward, uncomplicated game. Its great because there is no board, no drawing required, and no physical skills required other than to push a couple of buttons."
5,This game is awesome!,"I bought this game after playing it at a friend's party and I just had to have one! Everyone who I have played this game with has become hooked as well. This unit has so many words and phrases that I haven't yet seen any repeats. Also, the fact that it is a handheld game makes it easy to play anywhere. The only drawback is the loudness of the timer. It was so annoying that we actually just put some duct tape over the speaker. You could still hear the timer and it was much more bearable. All in all, a great product! A must-have for any gathering!"
1,Catch Phrase,"I bought this product for my daughter, but I have seen it sold in stores for a much better price than I got here."
5,Sweet Piano Suite,"Over It and All the Girls Hate her are stunning examples of her virtuosity. I wish she'd do more instrumentals! Over It gives me a striking image of this very wide bolt of silk unfolding and unrolling on a somewhat windy beach. Some chords and chord changes that make you go Wow and (as usual with her) very nice highs and lows and dynamics all around. Also, the octave bumps in All The Girls Hate Her are very effective and nice. This piano suite is definitely worth 5 bucks."
2,Amy,"We recently started collecting the Thomas train items for our son. Just about everything we have purchased so far has been super, however this bridge is not the greatest. The problem is that the covered bridge and connecting track will not stay on the risers. The slightest bump and the track collapses. Hope this was helpful."
4,My 2 year old son loves this covered bridge!,"I hear what the first reviewer is saying about the covered bridge falling from the supports easily, however my son absolutely loves this bridge and plays with it constantly. He loves how the trains pass through the bridge, but you can still see them through the windows. If we get tired of setting it up on the supports over and over, we just set it up so it sits flat on the table and it's still alot of fun for him. I'm recommending this covered bridge because it's a simple, fun piece for your collection. No bells and whistles, just imagination, make this toy fun."
2,Really disappointed in Levis this time,"This is the first pair of jeans I've had to buy in a few years. I was replacing a pair of the same make and model, Levi's Men's 505s. The fabric is lighter, the cut is lower, really down on the hips now. Clearly cost cutting has been going on. They fit OK and I'm keeping them, but a standard model from a venerable brand should not be getting watered down. Clearly will not be lasting as long. These should be branded under a new number to identify the new cut and the cheaper fabric!!"
4,"Good, but there are problems","I have had this book for a year now and have made a few dozen recipes out of it. Overall they have been good ones and the book is full of good information on the hows and whys of baking. That said, I have had trouble with a couple of the recipes being not completely correct. In one case, the proportions for making a strusel topping were off, resulting in a too dry topping. The other calls for an ungreased baking pan, causing the bars I was making to stick terribly. Not huge issues, granted, but annoying none the less."
5,This destroys Pat Boone,Here is a great compilation of early '60s rock 'n' roll from Heinz & Joe Meek that clearly shows that the Brits were superior to the Americans when it came to music. No syrupy ballads or watered down remakes (like Pat Boone did) here. Good rocking songs with great guitar solos courtesy of one young Ritchie Blackmore (on most of them).Buy it!!!
2,"Great idea, but wears out too quickly","I bought one of these several years ago. It is a good solution for measuring sticky stuff, like honey. There are several problems, however. It is not dishwasher safe. The printing is wearing off even though it is only washed by hand. It does not slide easily, requires a lot of elbow grease to extract the honey. But, it is still a better solution than using regular measuring cups. Next time, I'm looking for dishwasher safe as a minimum requirement."
2,Plastic splits with very little use.,I use regular measuring cups most of the time so mine has had very little use. I got it out to use and the plastic is split. Time to toss it in the trash.
4,Ghost story I've spoken of most often!,"I will agree with others, that the novel is a bit wordy, however the story is scary. What made my skin crawl the most was the police report/eye witness account of the boyfriend, this just creeped me out!I really enjoyed the movie also, I believe it stayed true to the important bits in the book.If you enjoy this type of story, a must read, as I mention in the title, I have spoken of this book/story more often then any other ""based on real events"" ghost story."
2,A disappointing Ghost Story,"In this supposedly truth based tale of a woman becoming the subject of sexual attacks by a ghost, author Frank De Felitta tries to recreate the success of his best novel to date `Audrey Rose'. This time the formula doesn't work. The Entity is excessively overlong and apart from one incident near the beginning of the book, scare free. The well defined characters appear to exist in a vacuum. The tone changes later as the author presents both sides of the argument as to whether the events are real or just in the mind of Carlotta, the woman to whom the attacks happen. But, as no questions are answered even this comes across as just a cop out. Very disappointing."
2,great triathlon watch if you don't do triathlon,"this watch has been great to wear, easy to use, and very comfortable....until it filled up with water during my first swim with it on. I guess you get what you pay for. Other than the water resistance issue it has been excellant."
3,Timex Ironman Flix,"The watch works with typical Timex accuracy. The method in which the watch is set are consistent with the other ""Ironman"" models I've purchased. This particular model has the fabric/velcro type band. (Other's I've owned have had the traditional vinyl band.) The tip of the band is too large to easily fit through the loop part of the closure mechanism. I have to push very hard to get it through and, while holding the watch when doing this, will sometimes inadvertently cause the mode to change. Otherwise an acceptable product."
3,I Didn't Get It,"I love edgy, interesting, non-traditional graphic novels. I admire artists that take chances with their styles, and veer off from the DC/Marvel school of comic drawing. I really love stories that emphasize character and are not afraid to be a bit odd.""Pistol Whip - The Yellow Menace"" was all of these things: edgy, daring, and non-traditional artwork.Somehow, I just didn't get it. It didn't light my fire. Maybe it was the weird art style which seemed rushed at times to me. Perhaps it was just the convoluted story and characters that I couldn't follow.This book is highly regarded- so don't just take my word for it. But I would caution you to browse a few pages before investing in it, because it may not be for you."
5,Handy guide over the usual bumps,"This book helps girls weave through life. They start out with the best of intentions until it happens. What is it? The reason that all girls have for saying yes to their boyfriends. Someone convinced them. Their boyfriends beg and plead and cry. As the book says it's more pressure than being held capative by the enemy only the enemy is their boyfriends' libedo.If they know ahead of time exactly what will happen, it doesn't have the same impact as finding out in some private spot alone with them. They will hear their words verbatium spoken out loud probably only a short time after they read them in the book. They will know that he's going to beg and plead so when he does she's more than just not surprised. She's prepared. That's huge.The blanks pages in the back have an exercise that's really important too. This book may be a little but, but will leave a huge impression on the lives of any girl who reads it."
3,Play it with a timer,"My main problem with this game probably has more to do with the people with whom I have played it. It usually takes at least twice as long as it should because everyone spends too much time trying to think of an answer, particularly if you play it in teams. In that case, every question involves a five-minute discussion, starting with someone throwing out a perfectly good guess and ending when they decide to guess that first thing that was said. I think it would be nice if the game included a timer, 30 seconds max. If you haven't given an answer before the time is up, you lose your turn."
2,Not as fun as the other versions,"I have Trivial Pursuit Genus, Genus IV, and Milenium editions, so I was trilled to see this new edition. I was dissapointed by the extreme obscurity and difficulty of some of the questions. The cards are numbered and it seems that the lower the number, the easier the question. To compensate, we had to shuffle all of the cards to make the game fair for all players.It's not as topical or funny as the previous versions, hence we've played it twice and put it back on the shelf."
4,"Same as Genus IV, just updated.",This edition of Trivial Pursuit is very comparable to Genus IV. The only difference is the questions are updated and a lot of them are about events that happened within the last two years. A great family game or for when friends get together.
2,Hasbro Doesn't Cut It!,"Parker Brothers sold the Trivial Pursuit rights over to Hasbro and they can't make a board game to save their life! The board is annoying. It's very hard to make out the colors, see the squares right, etc. The questions are next to impossible, even my parents who are over 50 could not answer most of the questions! My husband who thinks he knows everything, even admitted that this game was just too hard. We found the questions to be written poorly and often misunderstood by the phrasing. We decided to try out Trivial Pursuit IV and loved it! Hasbro just can't cut it! I'm sorry to say but I beleive this is the end of Trivial Pursuit as we knew it."
3,Okay but don't buy new.,"If you just want to play with the idea of making games, this book is okay. But don't expect to make anything spectacular. The software on the CD is outdated and all trial but one in which you can only use a pallette of 256 colors. Forget upgrading. The company which made the 3D software and engine went out of business about two years ago and the last version was too buggy and cumbersome to be practical.I wouldn't buy it today due to there being better sources of free 3D modeling and game making engines on the internet that surpass the book's content."
1,fillnns,"So ... opened my drill box one day, not too long after having purchase this product as a replacement, just to find that the chuck had failed while sitting in the drill box. Cheap only goes so far ... this one made to the finish line. What a disappointment. A shame as the drill has worked for several years now."
5,It's A Great Book,"I have been very happy with this purchase. It serves my needs nicely. I always have a reference handy for birthdays,anniversaries and any other type of special occassion cards."
1,disappointed,"This is about my fourth or fifth Ironman/Marathon watch from Timex...They are exceptionally reliable for the price, and I just need a day to day watch that can take a beating with workouts, etc. I usually buy them at Target, but I was buying other stuff from Amazon and thought I would save myself the drive. Mistake!I have only had this watch for about 18 months... mine usually last until the plastic band dry rots and cracks, which you can imagine is a long time. I unpacked this one, and noticed right away it had flaws in the plastic of the face, and within a week the pink paint had started chipping off the plastic. I kept it anyway...should have sent it back, though-- Just this week the indiglo button died on me, and now the ""mode/pulse"" button won't work either. Piece of crap. Amazon, I will think twice about buying electronics from you again."
3,Timex,"The watch is more of a lavendar color, I was a little disappointed about that when I received the watch. Over all no issues just yet."
2,"Excellent watch to start with, but NOT durable","I bought this watch when I started my re-entry into running. There were other models with more features (ie intervals would be nice), but for a reasonably priced basic watch to get me started, it was great. I used it for an every day watch, but never for swimming or anything unusually hard on it. After 6 months, the display just disappeared.I tried getting a new battery - that was not the problem. Of course I can't find my receipt, and for the cost, it's probably not worth the hassle of sending it back. But I won't buy another one. Too bad - great watch for the money - for about 6 months."
4,good book on variable speed theory.,"I have been interested in electric motor controls for use in robotics for some time. This is the best book on the subject I have found so far. The book assumes you have a fairly complete knowledge of IGBTs, Mosfets and a solid background in electronics. Lacks important information on 3 phase, two phase, and single phase induction motor operation theory. Has good description of various problems produced by variable speed drives. There is a good theoretical overview of variable speed drive techniques."
5,I loved it!,"First of all, Julia Quinn needs to have a new book come out every week! That aside, I have read her books, obviously, and a couple of Karen Hawkins, whom I love. The other two I had not read. I am now a fan of all.Mia Ryans story is wonderful, Julia Quinn's, as always is ""splendid"" and Karen Hawkins story was my favorite. A big sigh.Buy this book...it is a wonderful group of romantic stories."
5,Best Use of the Half Life 2 Engine Since Half Life 2,"This game is INTENSE! I am only an hour or so into it and I am completely HOOKED. The graphics, visuals, interactivity, weapons, sound effects, environments, I could go on and on.Like HL and HL2, this game is void of the ""level map mentality"". You find yourself seemlessly moving through a continuous and expertly connected environment where you come around a corner only to recognize that you made it to the area you saw through the fence. There are no levels here, you are immersed in an entire world. The scripting, dialogue, sound clips....all class act and well done.If the concept of episodes is to get my first $19.99 then sell me additional episodes in a continuing saga for $19.99 each...count me in! This avoids the lengthy dry spells without a new game. PURE GENIUS"
3,A fun shooter,"This is a game that takes many things from half-life 2, but it does not do them as good. It is still a decent shooter, but do not expect it to be half-life 2, if you are expecting that, then you are going to be disappointed. But never-th-less, it is still a decent and entertaining shooter."
3,Short and kinda sweet...,"This is the first episode in what I believe is going to be 9. Not bad. Good story, some fun sequences, but id suggesting waiting till all the episodes are out."
4,Sin,"I love the first game,hope to love this one also,i havent been able to play yet due to the fact that i need internet connection to install the game wich i do not have at the moment,wish there was some way around this."
3,"Nastalgia, yes; recording quality, no.","As a huge fan of Chicago, I only had recordings on vinyl. I was excited to hear the music but thought sure this would be re-mastered to correct the flaws, I was wrong. On a good sound system, the flaws literally jump out at you. Though I still love the music, I'm not sure this was the right purchase."
4,chicagoIx: greatest hits 69-74,"I love this CD! It's just like being at one of Chicago's concerts: good sound quality, great variety of songs - all my favorites."
1,Hogbutcher of the world = mushy lite elevator shlock band?,"What would make this great?Sending all copies to Mars,and far from my ears."
2,No Trashy Town,"Should have read the reviews, but trusted the description of the video. Never again! Bought this for Trashy Town. Amazon should check info before having it on screen. Kids love Chicka Chicka, but that was only one reason for purchase!"
2,Deja vu,"I agree with another reviewer. This was my third Bianchin book, and I couldn't tell them apart. New character names don't make a new book. Actually, there was one difference. The heroine was way more annoying in this book. When endangered, she complained about her husband increasing the security at her store. Moron. This book might be a three-star if I hadn't already read other Bianchin books with the same plot, but done better."
3,Captures the spirit at the dawn of the space age.,"I enjoyed this black & white movie with its low-budget and unpretentious filmmaking. The acting is stiff, and the science behind the plot makes some leaps (you cannot accidentally end up on Mars in a rocket built for a voyage to the moon!). The movie moves at a slow pace. Yet for all its shortcomings, it captures a relentless optimism that propelled us through World War II and on into the space age.And there is a plot twist that feels oh-so-real and yet is remarkably unexpected.And who can resist seeing Lloyd Bridges of ""Sea Hunt"" fame in an early role from the 1950s?!If you like movies that provoke thought, have less action and more message, give this one a try."
4,Fun Gift For Retiring Brother ... he liked it.,Purchased this book (and other fun gifts) for my bother who is retiring after 40 years ... he will enjoy it along with the other gag gifts purchased. Recommend.
5,This album is TIGHT!,"I was first introduced to Chad Kroeger in 2002 care of his hit from the Spiderman C.D. ""Hero"". I thought after that song he would be a one-hit-wonder and was pleasantly surprised to find out that he was the lead singer of a band named Nickleback. After I heard ""Photograph"" played on FM radio, I broke down and decided to buy the album and was glad I did. This C.D. is packed with great heavy metal songs that have good lyrics to them. I went to see Nickleback in concert last night and the majority of songs they played are from this album. When you hear it, you will understand why. I do not skip any songs on this C.D. when I listen to it. Nickelback seems to have found a niche in doing ballad songs and I hope they have continued success with what they are doing. Overall, ""All the Right Reasons"" is a solid, accessible rock album. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Album Number 5 but sounds like ""number 2"" pun intended.","Title says enough. Rockstar is the last song on the album and it is being played on the top 40 stations. Change the title to Pop star. get them a cover on Teen Dreamz Magazine. ""stay skinny"""
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed by this album. The lyrics were a lot cruder than I had hoped for. I LOVE the photograph song, and 1 or 2 of the others are all right, but the rest are pretty much a let down."
3,Another great one but does it measure up?,"I think these guys rock! Great tunes and a great band live aswell! For me I think the best work from Nickelback was ""SilverSide Up"", just barely edging out ""Long Hard Road"". If you likeNickelback you will like this one as well. How much you like itwill depend on what you like about Nickelback? For me it'sstill good but it doesn't measure up to the previous two. Tomany extremely ""Radio Friendly Ballads"" and not enough ""In YourFace"" ones for me. You know ""Hollywood"" from ""Silver""and ""Because of You"" from ""Road"". Like I said it still has somegood tunes but in general it doesn't have that edge of theothers. On a side note the lyrics of ""Next Contestant"" just hasto make you laugh. The song rips but cryin' about a strippergirlfriend that is getting hit on?! Come on Chad......"
2,Overplayed and overrated,"I'm sure this CD is going to sell millions of copies in the U.S. so I don't see any reason why I have to be overly nice about it on a review.Nickelback has to be the blandest band on the radio right now. Same recycled ideas, same generic songs, same gravelly-sounding lead vocals. When are they going to come up with something new? ""Photograph"" is already one of the most overplayed songs in the U.S.Why does Nickelback get so much airplay in this country? What makes this band or this lead singer any more distinctive than any other band that's out there right now? Can there be that many actual requests for Nickelback songs?I think this band gets a lot of airplay in the U.S. because its ""safe"" music - it stays inside the bounds. It doesn't offend anyone, doesn't push anyone's buttons, it doesn't register on anyone's scale. In other words - boring!"
1,Ugh,"Why are these guys even popular? Nickelback has come to represent what main stream rock has become. Instead of getting The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who, or Guns N Roses...my generation gets Nickelback! It is not fair. Where has the talent gone? Everytime I turn on the radio I hear this band. The lead singer sounds like he is constantly constipated and the guitar licks are pitiful. Maybe they need to spend time with Eric Clapton or Neil Young to find out how to write a decent rock song. It is just not fair that my generation has to listen to acts like Nickelback, Ashlee Simpson, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan. Where has the talent gone!?!"
1,Everything Is Wrong About This 'Right',"Putrid neo-grungesters who commit the worst sin - not admitting they are putrid neo-grungesters. This replicates the last 2 albums, and if that's your cup of vomit, enjoy. My grade: C"
3,Leave your english teacher at the door,"Don't hit play planning to hear the most complex lyrics, musical innovation, or anything different than the last time Nickelback hit your playlist. But, also keep in mind that music has genres for a reason. I'd have to put Nickelback in the Rock/Pop category--their music is rock, but the words are pop. As long as you aren't looking for songs that need to be pondered over coffee with your friends on a rainy day, this album rocks from start to finish with catchy riffs the whole way. Sure, every now and then I realize how cheesy a line is, but every now and then it's EXACTLY what I want."
2,I don't even need to buy the cd...,"I've heard a couple of their tracks, such as ""rockstar"" and ""Photograph"" which is now played 24/7 on my radio station... I can just about decide for myself that this album is just like their other 4-5 albums before (released and unreleased). It all sounds alike, and the lyrics are about the same things generally (with the same words), so if I bought this cd I'd probably just archive it and never listen to it. I could be wrong, you never know. ONE of their songs might be totally revolutionary, but considering their past albums I find that VERY hard to believe.Don't waste your money on this cd, borrow it from a friend and make a copy if you're that much of a NB fan."
1,There is no god,"I had to rub my eyes when I actually saw some 5 star reviews, what are you people thinking? Have you ever ventured out beyond the music of your radio stations and found music with real meaning? Music which doesn't take direct aim at the pockets of the average joe. This by no means should come under the category of hard-rock or metal. This is pop all the way baby.There is so much to hate about this band - Kroeger's voice is akin to the noise you make when you scratch your nails down a blackboard, word has it his voice is put through a synthesizer as well to make it sound decent (not that a synthesizer will do the job). The three chord songs which all sound the same. With lyrics like ""I like your pants around your feet"" and that song about having a house on mtv cribs. I actually feel compelled to buy a ticket to Canada so I can punch Kroeger in the face.The music industry is going downhill at a rate of knots, and as long as bands like Nickleback are around, it will continue to do so."
1,All the wrong reasons,"Wow . . .I've never encouraged the purchasing of ""singles"", but this album was a tremendous letdown. I recommend acquiring their 1st single (Photograph) and leaving the whole album on the shelf. I love Nickelback, and I'll purchase their next album. That being said, this one is horrible. Photograph is one of the only decent tracks (""Rock Star"" is fun, and ""Fight For All The Wrong Reasons"" is cool musically). Unacceptably simple lyrics and boring music characterize this cd. I am very let down. Better luck next time, guys."
5,Animals rocks!,"I'm very impressed by this album. I didn't think I knew Nickelback's music about six months ago until I heard Rockstar for the first time. The singers voice sounded familiar, but I didn't know what songs they sang. I was amazed after buying the album how many of these songs have been played on the radio. The one song that stands out to me that hasn't had a lot of play time on the stations that I listen to is Animals. This song rocks! Hard charging rock 'n roll! Also, the live version of the songs are so clear that I thought I was hearing static in the background while the whole time it was just the crowd cheering."
1,Middle of the road...,"The lame artwork for this lame band lets you know right off the bat that you are not going to be stretching any boundaries here. This is pure middle of the road drivel, plain and simple. A band this bad could only come from Canada."
1,Corporate Drivel,"Nickelback is one of those bands that have their legion of ignorant gushing fans who think they are a great talented band, but fans of real rock music outside of that little niche don't even take seriously. Nickelback is the 2000s equivalent of Foreigner, that is, a horrible band with some catchy hooks that exists purely to make a buck."
5,Killer CD,"Truly rockin album! Reminds me of my wilder, younger days and prompted me to buy tickets to the upcoming concert. Loved it and so does my six year old!"
5,Fantastic...,"Their best cd up til then. Darkhorse was great too....but this one truly is great. Almost every song truly could be considered a true hit. Love the band, and this is a must have for Nickelback fans. Phenomenal is the only way to explain this artwork."
5,Great product.,Lots of ideas for phonemic awareness activities and lots of printable cards to use. I tutor struggling readers and this has added variety to our lessons.
3,dixie carter,"i just loved this woman and the show ""DESIGNING WOMEN"".I WAS SAD TO HEAR OF HER PASSING-REALLY SADAS FOR THE BOOK IT'S A HARD READ.STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED.HOPE IT BECOMES MORE INTERESTING...ON CHAPTER 4AT THIS WRITING"
4,a neat and tidy mystery,"After reading the first book in this short lived series, I simply had to read the next one. A Murder in Thebes is not THE best mystery I've ever read, but it is was still a pleasing read. The heroine, Miriam, was a captivating character, however, Simione, her brother felt 2D. I especially appreciated the involvement of Alexander and the political intrigues in that period. Overall: worth reading if you're a fan of Alexander the Great."
5,"Mental alertness without caffeine, HOOAH!","I love this taste even better than the punch:tropical. It's so smooth, so light! U.S. Military scientists say it improves mental alertness up to 50%. I think they're right. Kudos U.S. Military! Being next to Camp Pendleton I love that this supports our troops."
5,Creative and Stimulating!,"This book is a must for any parent who wants to stimulate their child's curiosity in the world--and what parent doesn't? The subject matter focuses on everyday items, but provides interesting, little-known facts about these inventions(and probably some fun, harmless fiction). Great for getting kids to start thinking creatively about where the things around them come from, and how big ideas are generated. The illustrations are cute and witty, with spectacular colors. Each invention provides a great launching point for discussion with your children. What more could you ask?This book was recently listed on the Time magazine web site as one of six ""best children's books you've never heard of."" The ""never heard of"" part won't last long...The authors first book (yes, I bought that one too!) is equally thought provoking about children's goals early in life, yet also, charming and sweet."
3,SKF packaged bearing,"Recently installed this product and all seems fine thus far.One point to note would be that this product is not manufactured by SKF, rather it is made by NSK and packaged by SKF.SO its really a NSK bearing."
3,Decent basketball for the price,"Decent basketball for the price, its tacky with a nice grip, but kind of light. I would spend a little more for a better quality ball, but I won't complain because I didn't want to spend that extra money."
4,Nice Grip On This Ball But Overpriced,"This is an excellent basketball for both outdoor and indoor use, although it will keep its grip much longer if used only indoors.The super grip gives the ball handler excellent control when making cuts and crossovers plus it is much easier to palm!This goes for pretty much every basketball but remember to bring your ball in to your garage or a shaded area after playing. Otherwise, the ball will start to split at the seams if left out in the sun.This ball would have gotten the coveted 5 star rating but the price is a little high compared to similar balls out there. They need to knock $5 off the price. Otherwise, it does the job and the grip is awesome."
4,Surface Prefers Indoor Play,"Overall, good ball for the price. Looks and feels great straight from the box. Nice tacky surface that is great for grip. Does what you would expect from a new basket ball. This ball is marked for indoor/outdoor play. But the tacky surface feels artificial and won't last long outdoors. It will lose the grippiness after picking up too much dirt and dust and the it will feel worn out. Keep it clean, play indoors and the ball should last a while."
4,Excellent basketball for the price,"I ordered this 29.5"" basketball with the only intention of playing with my young son. Having said that, I was not too worried about getting a more professional ball.For starters I could not play with it out of the package as it did not have enough air in it, so we had to wait until I could have it inflated (unfortunately I do not have the needed tools at home) The ball looks really cool, it is light and has a nice grip.We have had it for a little over a week and we like it so far, again, I am not playing professionally or anything like that, it is a basket ball I am using to teach my young son how to play so, works great for me!"
5,Great CD for an amazing anime!,"Absolutely beautiful music by Christopher Franke that captures the full effect of the first Tenchi movie! Mostly BGM, but has one vocal track, ""The Alchemy of Love"" which is a very lovely piece of music. Great CD!!!"
4,"A Little Redundant, but Still Great","I was suprised to see that this soundtrack was created by someone not Japanese. I had seen a Japanese movie--I was expecting a Japanese soundtrack. But Mr. Franke was very worthy of creating this; listening to it is proof.All of the songs, when played in the movie, went along beautifully, enhancing the mood and keeping the ""Tenchi"" feel. However, when listening to the music by itself many of the tracks repeat the same general song, just in different variations. This isn't too bad, though, since it still manages to keep some variety.Bottom line: If you liked the movie, you'll like the CD."
1,Not as described.,I buy used books often based on how well their condition is in the listing. This book was not at all as described. There is writing and highlighting on nearly every page making it difficult to actually read. Quite frustrating.
2,"The ""Empire"" equals capitalism?","Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat would have us believe that the empire of the 1st century is the equivalent of capitalism in the 21'st century. I give them their due as biblical scholars, but neither has a working knowledge of the industrial revolution nor capitalism. There exists in this book too much mindless railing against the ""empire"" of post modern times. There is no effort to compare and contrast the Roman empire and the democracies of today (as it would not serve their arguments). Certainly there is more truth to the aphorism ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" than the authors of this book would lead us to believe."
2,Mediocre light rock album.,"I was a fan of CTA through VIII. Then comes in the mid 70s, a different sound. Short, light rock songs that you'll forget in a day or so. I do like the hit, ""If You Leave Me Now"".Maybe it was because I didn't grow up during this album but I find it and XI pretty boring. Hot Streets was a improvement probably because I like the glossier production better and the disco/funk. Their creative ways were behind them but thankfully this slump didn't last long."
1,Desperately Dull,"Bland pop in the style of Roxette, the band is best know for the novelty hit `I Touch Myself', which is NOT on this album. Without a hit to recommend it this album is just a waste of space."
2,Expected better.,"Read a lot of Ann Rule's books ... this was her dullest by far. The stories seemed shallow and what depth there seemed to be was only because the author used the same phrases over and over again in several stories. How many ways can you say the same thing? Also, the stories were great if you're from Seattle or that area...they would have a broader appeal if she picked some areas outside of Washington. But overall, the writing was not up to her usual par and despite the interesting subject matter, they fell flat.Maybe Number 7 will be better?"
3,middling quality for ann rule,"This is Volume 6 of Ann Rule's Crime Files. Some of Ann Rule's best books have been her ""Crime Files"" collections, but only when the volume is built around a book-length treatment of a fairly fresh case. The best collection by far has been ""Last Dance, Last Chance"". This book is somewhat like ""Without Pity"" in that the cases all seem kind of old. If, like me, you are a big Ann Rule fan who can't get enough, and waits anxiously for each new title, you should definitely get this book. It contains some interesting cases, just none that will knock your socks off. There is not the psychological depth here that we hope for in Ann Rule's very best work, that leaves the reader totally blown away. If you are new to Ann Rule, read one of her truly great books, like ""Small Sacrifices"", ""The Stranger Beside Me"", or ""Everything She Ever Wanted"". Read any of these and you will be hooked on Ann Rule too."
4,GREAT BOOK,"This is a very good book,although it has made me a bit paranoid about going places or being alone.The stories in this book are very graphic,depressing,but compelling.The only flaw with this book is that at times I was bored with how long it actually took the story to begin,such as The Bus To Nowhere and The Lost Lady,although I guess its to help better understand the people and victims. Overall a very good book,i recommend it."
5,Great book & CD,"I've been using it for years, and now give it as a gift. I've been able to go off anxiety meds by doing these meditations."
5,Extremely helpful,"I am a novice to these new& exciting world that has recently begun unfolding for me. I knew virtually nothing in regards to chakras until reading this book. The explanations were clear& concise. I know ""get it"". I understand what they correspond to in my life&I have told to clear them& make them healthier. Thank you"
5,Chakra Clearing,"If looking for a basic book to explain about the Chakras this is it. A very easy read and purse size so that you can take it anywhere and practice the ""quick meditations"" and study on the go! Great book for Beginners!"
3,No idea this was just a book,I honestly thought this was a CD to clear chakras not a book. I cant really rate it because I havent read it but I know it must be good but it really needs to be stated that it is either a book or CD
3,"Not a terrible album, but flawed.","In comparison to the two masterpieces that preceeded this album (CTA and II), Chicago turned out this somewhat disappointing album. Overall, upon glancing at the track listing, one notices that much of the album is divided into segments, like II was. However, this gives the impression that this album was a commercial attempt to recreate the magic of II, and that truly becomes apparent upon listening.That's not to say that the album is completely disappointing. Sure, the first song from the Travel Suite, the entire Kath segment, and Lowdown are all below par and can't even begin to compare to the writing from these members on II. However, the first 4 songs on the album, most of the Travel Suite, Mother, and the instrumental suite from Pankow at the end of the album make this experience worthwhile, even if not monumental."
3,Finally broke Down And Bought This ...,"This was somewhat of a disappointment for Chicago fans. Not their best work in my opinion, but then again how do you follow up a masterpiece like Chicago II?"
3,Traffic Snarl On The Eisenhower,"With this release, the ideas petered out and they started the transition into becoming the average AOR band. This CD does not hold together as CTA and II did."
2,Chicago III,"With this release, Chicago had produced three double-LP sets within 2 years, which cluttered the market and drained the band members' creativity. The result was a fall off in quality and sales, though Chicago III did manage to stay on the charts for over a year, selling a million copies. The hits are ""Free"" and ""Lowdown"", neither of which is among the group's best."
5,Billy Daniels review,I remember growing up and listening to Billy Daniels with fondness. His vocal power and range never got the attention or accolades as did other artist's of the time. I put him in the top five of my all time singer's. Take a chance with his music and you will be suprised what a fantastic voice he had.
3,A good introduction to Billy Daniels,If you know Billy Daniels you will be pleased with this studio recording. He was a visual artist who performed well on stage. Most of his recordings are from live shows when he involved himself with banter with his pianist . This being a studio recording shows what a fine voice he had. His career was blighted most probably due to involvement with the wiseguys
3,Not full HD,"It is good that the Blu-ray version is only a few $ more than the standard DVD set, because the great park scenes you were expecting were not shot in full digital HD format. I noticed this during the main run on PBS HD, so it is not just the Blu-ray production.The ""making-of"" preview disk has shots of the camera they used, and it appears to be a 16mm film camera. HD can definitely show better color and more sharpness than 16mm analog film can deliver."
2,What Concept?,"The film makers tell us that the National Parks are 'America's Best Idea' because here, unlike Europe, the parks are established by The People -- not by the wealthy, entitled nobility. Then, they proceed to tell us about how this park or that one was brought into being as the result of the efforts of this or that wealthy, powerful and/or politically connected person. Wow, way to undermine what was supposed to be the central theme of your film, guys.I think fifteen or twenty sepia-toned images of people standing or sitting at the edge of a cliff is sufficient; sadly, the film makers don't seem to agree with me. Weren't we told in the promo piece that ran on PBS prior to the release of the series that these guys filmed in the parks for years? How about showing more of that footage instead?I want my pledge dollars back."
3,"A new narrator,please Ken!","I absolutly love Ken Burns documentaries.IMO they are the best, period.I own most of them.That said, i enjoyed the stories of this one.The photography was awesome as always.Its Peter Coyote's voice that i cant stand.Geez.Ken had top notch narrators with awesome voices in all of his earlier works.This guy is a total dud! Get rid of this clown,Ken.He's wrecked Parks and now Prohibition.Great topics and stories galore and yet this boring voice ruins it for me.Morgan Freeman cant be that busy,if he is how bout that guy from the Allstate insurance commercials? He needs to eat,or he would'nt be doing commercials get him to narrate the next one."
5,A good way for foreigner's to see a part of the Soul of America and Americans,"This country of ours is relatively new as Nations go. Our struggles have helped mold us into the Greatest Nation on an ever shrinking Plant. The impact of what we do, or don't do lasts far beyond our short Lives.These DVDs are not just a collection of pretty pictures and places. But they also tell us that in American of how just a few determined people can bring out what ""is"" greatest in all of us.I hope that all that view these DVDs are moved to go out and visit these places. Or if not; At least may you be moved in spirit to understand why every American must stay forever vigilant. Please believe me when I tell you that it is only through ""you"" that others will understand the Beauty in our own Backyards. It is up to you and your children to enjoy what we have, and let others know how it feels being held in the hands of ....Enjoy!"
2,Thanks for the 1960s home movie Ken Burns,"The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display. Burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. I will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if Peter Coyote (narrator) is a little dry.Do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard DVD version with this series."
3,Don't get the Blu Ray version..,"I have watched this in both DVD and Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray version was very grainy whereas the DVD was smooth and sharp. Needless to say, I was surprised and disappointed. Save yourself some money and get the DVD instead."
3,Beautiful teapot a couple of drawbacks,"This teapot is very beautiful and for the price...very nice. However, I have a couple of complaints. I bought this teapot because I drink herbal tea all day. The teapot does keep it hot, but not enough for me to drink the whole pot. Also, the infuser is very high up so a full pot must be made. For these two reasons, I would not purchase this teapot on size alone. It would have been better for me to buy a smaller teapot and make another pot, rather than warm my unused tea on the stove and pour it back in, which is what I do. If serving many people it would be great, but for one or two people it is too big and the infuser is too high."
3,Entertaining,One Way or Another by Peter Cameron is a humorous set of short stories. Cameron's style of writing reminds me of Melissa Bank's Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing
3,Difficult to blend,"This does offer full coverage and a nice selection of shades, but it is very difficult to blend and a bit greasy. I salvaged the tube by mixing it with the tinted moisturizer I get from Clarins. I have yet to find anything that can beat it for beautiful color and blendable coverage."
4,heavy!,"THis a basic, heavy-duty walking foot machine. I don't think one could beat it at the price, the servomotor drive has worked flawlessly. I geared it down with a smaller pulley and a link belt, which improved starting power considerably. You wouldn't want to sew at high speeds, it's not well balanced, and the lubrication needs to be attended to, but it will sew all day everyday. I've sewn up to 10 layers of sunbrella in corner braces and such, no problem, but get the smaller pulley (I had to make one from something close i found and could machine, so get it from the dealer). And those link-belts are fantastic!"
3,make sure you don't weigh much,"Nice toy but make sure your child does not weigh very much or else the plastic will suffer in the center. I weigh 102 lbs. and tried to use it but shouldn't have. It did not break but the plastic streched in the center and turned white at the creases where you put the ball. The zigzag for the ball is a great tool when you have mastery of the indoboard. I believe it's a great toy for a child, much better than sitting on a couch playing videogames."
4,"Odd, yet interesting","This book is first and foremost of great interest to students of the arts, illustrating the social climate in which German artists between the World Wars worked and its effect on their art. Additionally, it should also interest hard core true crime buffs. There are plenty of interesting tidbits about Peter Kurten and Fritz Haarman, two of Germany's most twisted citizens, and it is fascinating to see how their crimes influenced German attitudes, reflected in the violent art that the region produced. One could draw parallels to modern American society's current attitudes towards serial killers, but that's another book entirely."
2,CHICAGO IS A STUDIO BAND!!,This recording is so disappointing.It reveals the bands weaknesses that are well masked by a good studio mixer. Where do we start?? In the Country is horrible;Fancy Colours ok;Does Anybody Really Know...stinks!Questions 67-68 bites;South Calif.Purples-good actually. Other smelly songs-I don't want your money;Sing a Mean Tune Kid...It just goes on and on.Stay away from this and the live in Japan album. Enjoy their studio work.Their arrangements are very good.I wonder after listening to them play live how they could've have written such good songs.
3,An ambitious project,"Over 3 hours of Chicago, most would cringe at the thought.However this is a band that was in peak form with the legendary guitarist Terry Kath.After Kath died (self inflicted) the band changed their direction for the worse.This 3 CD set (with poor horn sound) is a concert recording covering the most interesting period of this large band.Chicago never did anything small scale.Some great songs througout however 3 CDs are too much to take in.A 2 CD set would have been better.The drum sound on this CD is my highlight, brilliant."
2,Read This as Only an Overview,"My wife, who's Protestant, and I, Roman Catholic, are looking at the Episcopal Church as possible common ground. In that spirit, we purchased ""Welcome to the Episcopal Church."" In 133 pages, Webber attempts to cover history, worship, the Bible, theology, spirituality, and the Church. It's waaay too much to cover in that small space. Worse, Webber attempts to be as welcoming and inclusive as he can, in the process saying little with real content. Some parts (history) are flatly incorrect, or, to be generous, inaccurate. Other parts (theology) are a genuine muddle. This book will be on the 10-cent table in our next yard sale."
2,Accurately Vague,"This book shows the basic practices and beliefs of the ECUSA along with the vagueness of why it believes what it does. Main explanation: We believe this because we always have... You can believe what you want whichever way you want. Accurate of the Episcopal Church, which means very wishy-washy. Comparable to Reform Judaism."
4,"A bit dry in places, but good information","A good basic intro that, while sometimes rather boring, covers the history, traditions and overall theology of the Episcopal Church in one book. The Dean of our Cathedral uses it as a know-thy-Church textbook in his confirmation/reception classes, so I'll trust his judgement. While it's not perfect it's the best book out there for discovering the Episcopal tradition."
1,Not much advice,"I was disappointed in this book- not much practical advice, almost nil hair cutting advice. He advises not washing hair every day. Ugh! I see plenty of unwashed hair and it isn't attractive. I don't use shampoo every day, but do use conditioner. Also, he is a big believer in setting hair with rollers. If you ask most males, their opinion is that women in hair rollers are very unattractive-good way to ruin a marriage. The hair styles are unimaginative (and need a set). Often he sends you to a ""professional stylist"" rather than helping you take care of hair on your own (Gray hair-difficult to color, go to professional.) Didn't learn anything new-all seems to be common sense."
3,Leading actors great even behind scenes,"Have fond memories of most ofleading actors in THE PROFESSIONALSsince they stayed in our hotelnear shooting site. Robert Ryan,now deceased, was our absoluteand personably favorite star.Marvin, of course, was true to life.This is a classic movie on my list."
5,Great Gem of a Movie,"I'm glad I found this hard-to-find gem on Amazon. It's wondrfully made, and proves westerns are not passe. Strong beautiful women, rugged intelligent men who are quite rascally, and interesting dialogue. At first, it seems like the typical story of good vs. evil, but the real story is in the shades of gray. More than worth the price, I highly recommend it."
2,different style,"The music was a little wilder an the vocal,s were a lighter and not as clear as chicago 16,17,18..whole different sound..the tape slowed down an the tape squeeled..not good"
4,One of the best books I've ever read,Lispector's work is great on this book!And it's interesting to read about how misearable some people are and they don't realise that! It's a great story to reflect on our own lives!
4,Versatile Mix,"This mix makes a good bread or can also be used to make pop overs which are nearly the same as those made with wheat. My wife is a celiac so we use this for bread, popovers and pizza crusts."
1,Play dough,My first loaf of this excuse for bread was gooey and baked like a brick. The second had the consistency of play dough. It did not spring back when kneaded or pressed. It did not rise. The description of it as biscuits was apt although I baked it in a big loaf it was just like heavy dense biscuits. Not what I anticipated.
5,Oustanding Series,"This entire series is amazing. I couldn't put them down once I started to read them. Start with The Last Jihad, read them in order......all 5. They will really make you wonder. Joel Rosenberg really gets and keeps your attention. How right is he? I'm not sure I want to find out. You won't be sorry you bought any of these books."
1,"All talk, not much action.","Disappointing. way too much ""talk"" not near enuf action. Action scenes great, just not enuf .. overpowered by all those names, talk, talk."
2,Really shallow,"I wholeheartedly agree with the review of Scott Gaines below. It's very difficult to stay 'in the book' when you are slapped into the now with such glaring technical errors. If weapons and tactics are going to play a large role in a novel it doesn't take much to do at least some basic research. Rosenberg profusely thanks (name dropping?) a lot of helpful folks at the beginning of the book but I noticed none of them had any experience at the 'blood and guts' level he wants us to think is being experienced by major players in peril.Rosenberg comes across as patronizing his fiction fans. He must have thought that his experience writing non-fiction automatically translates to good fiction. Readers of Clancy, Coonts, Dale Brown, et al will sneer at Rosenberg's naveté in this realm. Only two stars because I found myself rushing to get through it so I would have time left to read a good book."
2,Dull and inaccurate,"I couldn't finish this book; I quit about half way through it. The book is not a historical novel, but rather a future (when he wrote it) that didn't happen. As such, I just couldn't get ""into it"". I found that it was just a tedious series of imaginary biographies.I doubt that most people reading this book know the bio's of many of our political leaders in the same detail as the numerous characters in this book. Who has the time to waste on this fictional nonsense? If I want to read political biographies, I'll read non-fiction. It was just plain dull and uninteresting to me."
5,Good Followup To The Last Jihad!,"Jon Bennett and his bodyguard Erin McCoy attend a historicalsummit that is also attended by the U.S. Secretary of State and Yasser Arafat. The Palestinian security becomes a suicide bomberkilling the Secretary of State as well as Arafat. A civil warbreaks out among various faction who want to replace Arafat.Ourhero Bennett and McCoy and their delegation have to find a way out of the west bank.You have two villains,a Russian Gogolov and an Iranian,Jibril who are the masterminds behind all of the plansof evil.The evil planners have decided to dispatch suicide bombersquads to the United States.Bennett and McCoy finally escape butface an attack from terrorist forces bent on their demise.Thereis never a dull moment in this book.You will definitely find thisbook hard to put down.I hope Joel C. Rosenberg writes more books.His first two have been outstanding."
5,Treat Yourself to a Page Turner Political Thriller and Series!,"Although I have heard about Joel Rosenberg, I hadn't read any of his books until I started this political thriller series. The Last Jihad, the first book in the series, was awe-inspiring, I couldn't put it down. I began to research historical facts connected with the Middle East on the internet. Then I ordered the next book, The Last Days, from Amazon.com. It's almost like seeing current events in the Middle East and America on televison! I have learned some new facts about Israel, Palestine, and the Jewish and Muslim cultures, too. I am now ordering the last 3 books in the series, because everyone I've asked about the books have already loaned them out. They all love these books; Mr. Rosenberg writes very well. I can't wait to read the rest of his work! I'm going to donate my books to my church's library to share with others."
2,A lot said for low expectaions!,"Roger Corman has done better. This Jim Wynorski film comes complete with poor acting, poor visuals, bad scripting and bed character development. Daniel Baldwin was unrealistic in his role as a military colonel. None of the characters seemed to have the military presence needed for their role in this film except for Stephanie Haiduk and Tim Abell, who occasionally looked genuine. The flying provided some scenic views, but the combat scenes were fake looking. As soon as the pilot presses the button, the target explodes. There is no time in between launch and hit. You weren't even shown the missiles travelling through the air.The movie is roughly 85 minutes and the DVD comes in Pan & Scan format with trailers for other Corman films and includes cast biographies. There is no booklet or card in the DVD case. The only enjoyment one could get from this film is if you are a Baldwin fan and substance is not required in your viewing."
2,shadowzone,"Rental vhs case was dirty and picture quality poor. Total video breakup at end credits where ignorant owners of dirty, poorly maintained and cleaned VHS players of the day, would throw into rewind every tape at the first sign of end credits. After working in the video rental business for many years, this familiar tape damage was so common and so irritating!Thank God for DVD and end of edge damage and tape creases.Had there been any other copy at at an acceptable price for a ""B"" Full Moon movie, I would not have gambled 3 dollars on an relic VHS copy.Later, got a decent VHS copy and made my own DVD-R version (like I do with so many unavailable DVD copies).The Magnavox VHS/DVD recorder combo with in machine dubbing from VHS or front jacks for another DVD player or VHS input.1080p upconverting! Records many sources my Sony rejects. At Walmart for approx. $160.00. Works great!!!Don BraddockAtlanta"
3,Re: Screwpull Pocket Model Corkscrew,I bought this model wine opener for my son and daughter-in-law. They were not impressed. I was disappointed. The opener is very portable and it does the job. It is a little flimsy. The photo in the advertisement made the opener look easy to use. Both my daughter-in-law and myself had trouble with using the handle. I would have appreciated seeing a video clip of how it works before I purchased the item.
3,Not for me - Works the way it should,"I bought this after all of the positive reviews on Amazon. I must say that for the price and quality it is perfect... That being said I dont like the device at all.Yes it works the way it should and it does pull the cork up for you...but there is a lot to be done to get a bottle of wine opened here. The removal of the plastic piece to put on top etc, etc... Feels flimsy and fidgety to me...The above is my personal opinion about this product... I personally feel that any $5-10 corkscrew works as well as this thing does. I dont get the concept.....It works as it should and thus I am giving it a 3/5."
5,Screwpull Corkscrew,"This is the BEST corkscrew I've ever had. It is extremely easy to use, no tugging, pulling, or getting cork in the wine. I bought several to give as gifts."
5,A quality item,"I just had to order a new pocket model screw pull after my old one broke....after 20 years of use! I kid you not. I used it for 20 straight years - easily an average of two bottles per week, so well over 2,000 bottles. Not bad for $15."
5,Never been disappointed,"I have been the victim of many horrible bottle openers, as I'm sure many of you have. Some are horrible, some eat up the corks, some actually work but with quite a bit of effort. This Screwpull was suggested to us by a Bed & Breakfast owner in Napa. We bought one on our trip and I absolutely love it. So easy and we have never had a problem. And not out of your price range! You need one!"
4,Fun phone,"We have gotten a lot of compliments on this phone. The only problem is that the reception can sometimes be a little scratchy, but otherwise the phone is great!"
3,Glimpses of nirvana and the decline to come.,"It's always great to see more remastered Procol Harum on CD, but this one was not their finest hour. Abandoning the stately, elegant baroque stylings that made albums like ""A Salty Dog"" and ""Grand Hotel"" such epic masterpieces, the band wanted to rock harder on this one. Unfortunately, the material just wasn't on par with the band's previous work. Even producer Chris Thomas has been quoted as saying Procol was running out of ideas at this point. This CD does have it's moments. ""Nothing But The Truth"" certainly rates as a Procol classic. ""Thin End of the Wedge"" is dark and mysterious, albiet too short. But many of the songs here simply meander, lacking the dynamic contrasts that made past Procol Harum music unique. Most Procoholics are well aware of the sad decline that was to follow this album. Sadly, the seeds of that decline were planted on ""Exotic Birds & Fruit."""
2,not too good,the nose guard did not hold up to sweat it kept sleding down i could not make it tight enought was not happy with it
3,Circuit Sealer,"The purpose:Remake a keyboard short circuited and exploded Printed circuit.Result : I'm typing on it.Problem: After taking all the precautions indicated on the Writer and the sealer I ended up developing my own method and redoing the tracks up to 5 times to get it right.Root Cause: The pin tip are still too think. The trace just short circuits.Solution: Do the trace then use alcohol ,cotton and a pen to clear out the extras."
5,Don't Miss This One!,"This is one of the best books of its kind in the world. The author does a wonderful job of stitching it together. This goes beyond a page-turner: this book will take over your life. If you are at all interested in the tradition of mock trials fronting mock justice, this is one of the most ridiculous examples to ever hit the American big top."
4,faith,"This may not be as easy a read as many books on faith because it uses a lot of material from Luther, but it certainly a very thorough discussion on the subject.It is well worth the effort to read."
4,"Was delivered quickly, and installed in a snap.","I looked a few of these on-line, after seeing overpriced models in a SkyMall magazine. Settled on this one due to price, and favorable reviews. So far, so great. It was delivered quickly, and I installed both of them (one for my bike, and one for my wife's) in a couple hours. Would have been quicker, but I modified the install directions a little bit, to get the bikes up just a bit further, for more clearance. Great product!"
5,Great idea!,"I purchased two of these because we wanted to get our bikes up off the garage floor (actually my bike was still in the living room from Christmas because we just didn't have room in the garage). My husband installed them without complaint and so far, everything is great. This is really a good solution to storing a bike! I would recommend this to everyone!"
3,bike hoist,I bought this bike hoist and found out it would not work out for my walls. I was able to give it to a colleague who could use it in her garage.
1,Prooftexting for Preschoolers,"It's bad enough that the original book has been so influential; that Wilkinson is spreading his shallow prooftexting theology to teens and now little children is reprehensible. Jabez devotional, journal, Bible study (one must assume the title is sarcastic). Is there any end to what he'll do to milk this trend? Do your kids a favor. Teach them the stories of the important heroes of the Bible and leave Jabez to his previous obscurity."
4,Very comprehensive collection and good cover art.,"Even though it is another anthology, I bought it for my collection. Since there was no photo of the jacket, I thought I would inform all of you other collectors out there that the cover photo is the same that was on an import album from many years ago. The photo is of the three pair of bright red lipstick lips with the microphones in front of them. Happy collecting!"
3,first of a fantasy series,james rollisn writing under a pen name. the book was free for my kindle and so i tried it. the style of writing is quality and i do enjoy all of mr. rollins other books. this is just as entertaining. \a young woman's family is killed because they are seeking a witch- she is the one. a motely crew of fantasy folk help her escape the evil doers and in the greater quest of helping the world they live in acheive balance and harmony. a usual story line for these things.the action is good and of course there are new installments. i will read another but not sure if i will pursue the whole series.
5,Fantastic series,"This a fantastic fantasy series, and well worth the effort of tracking these heros battling super scary demons across mountains, plains, and swamps. Not to be missed."
3,Kind of a dissapointing sequel,"For some reason I didn't like this half as much as the first one. There seemed to be a heck of a lot more cliches, or at least cliches that weren't as entertainingly freshened and twisted as in ""Wit'ch's Fire."" I just couldn't connect as well with some of the newer characters too. (Although the brothers and their Sacrament was a wonderfully disturbing image.)"
3,Good show worth watching,This is a nice anime by a well known director this however is not a well known show but I assure you despite its obscurity it is worth watching while not excellent it is worth watching! It can be found at a reasonable price and though some may not like the 1 hour length I found it to be nice to fill a gap in my day without taking up to much time
4,LDS,I reaal love this book because im LDS so it is nice to to read about other LDS people its the best book ever.
2,Didn't they look around to see that disco had just died?,"Only Chicago would jump into the disco arena in late 1979 just before disco practicaly vanished as a form of popular music. Although some individual tracks such as ""Reruns"", ""Life is What It Is"" and ""Window Dreaming"" stand out, the remaining tracks leave the listener asking the question, ""Why?"" Also, Peter Cetera seems to be doing a strange imitation of Pete Puma on ""Aloha Mama"" and ""Window Dreaming"". The band sounds tired on the other tracks. Strangely, Chicago 13's disco opus ""Street Player"" has been recycled by the rap group ""The Bucketheads"" in 1995 and can be heard frequently in dance clubs. Perhaps Chicago was ahead of its time on this album after all."
1,Not a Complete box collection,Buyer beware. Purchased this Complete Box Collection and received only the first CD of the 4 CD set inside a collectors box. The description leads you to believe this is the full set.
1,narration,poor selection of a narrator for this book. Sounds like a member of the royal family talking to his subjects.
3,Hide & Q,"This episode marks the second appearance of the entity known as Q. Q gives Commander Riker the power of Q in an attempt to make Riker one of the Q. To this end, Q places the crew of the Enterprise in some 'games' to tempt Riker to join with him.All in all it's not a bad episode for the first season."
3,soccer halfback,"Soccer half backI really liked this book Soccer Half Back.This book was about a boy who plays on soccer team called the Nuggets. During this book they play a team called theSabers. I play on the Sabers so that is one of the many reasons I liked this book. During the book the Nuggets were complaining about the rough play of the sabers. When half time was over the Nuggets coach takes out the Nuggets best player Mose. The score was 2 to 0, then the Nuggets scored 2to1. The Nuggets were back in the game. The Nuggets best player is being doubled teamed. The rest is up to you- read the book and post a review to let me know how you like it."
5,Review of Soccer Halfback,"I liked this book a lot because it was interesting to read about the soccer games. The Nuggets (the name of one of the teams) played the Razorbacks and they played the Blue Jackets two times. The main character is Jabber. Jabber is really good at soccer; he scores two out of the four goals in one game. It is sad when Pete, Uncle Joe and Jabber's mom and dad say that he should play football because his dad was a football star. You will like this book if you like sports."
1,required reading,"I had to buy this for a class and honestly never opened it. I passed without a problem, but this isn't unnecessary. If you need a book to help with research. choose something else. This is a pointless buy"
4,Author's Didn't Do Their Homework,"The author's state that Historians did not do anything for the schools from around 1956 to 1986. This is not so, The Historians through the American Historical Association did a number of projects for the schools such as the Service Center for Teachers of History, The History Education Project as well as a number of other innovations. What Nash and the others are saying is that no national committee was in action. The historians attempted to have programs to help the teachers not set policy which seems to be the intent of the national standards. Anyone interested in the historians attempts to aid the schools by improving instruction and not formulating policy should read my doctoral dissertation:Clio's Disciples, Historians, Social Studies Educators and the Schools- 1956 to 1986."
1,Hysterical Writing,"I had to read this book for a graduate level course. Not only is it one sided, it contains WAY too much drama. Everything is either ultra, extreme or hateful.Added to this whole mix is the use of words that are not necessary. Does research have to be ""blooming""? This book is just plain silly.And to the authors'--run-on sentences do not make you look better."
4,The walls are definitely talking!,"Vincent Alexandria kicks open the door with Chapter 1 and doesn't close it until the last word is read. In between, you'd better strap on your seatbelt cause this is one WILD read! From the too possessive girlfriend, the mother of the fiance of the dead man who we later finds out is also his lover and soon to be baby mama; to the new girlfriend who is the sister of the fiance of the dead man (does this sound like incest yet?); to the revelation of the dead man's ""switch hitting"" ways...do you see what I mean. It will keep you reading and reading and reading until the end. Then you're pissed. Refreshingly delicious, you won't be dissappointed!"
5,Best do it yourself surfboard repair you can buy.,"This Solarez product is for fixing fiberglass surfboards, not newer epoxy surfboards.This is a clear resin that comes out of a tube and you apply it to cracks or holes in your surfboards.The stuff cures and hardens under UV light (sunlight) in about 5 minutes.After it hardens you must sand it smooth or apply another coating if needed.The package comes with a small square of sandpaper with a coarse side and a fine grit side.This is best for smaller dings/cracks but if you apply many coats you can fix even larger cracks and holes.Do not use this on an epoxy surfboard or you will damage the glassing.The stuff is white so if you have a colored surfboard the repair site won't color match. I would only use this on a white surfboard. Otherwise, get the clear version.I've been using Solarez for over 10 years and every surfer should have this at home!"
3,What you see is what you get.,"I was expecting to get all I needed with the spray gun and lance combo, but had to spend additional money for the rest of the lance."
4,good beef cookbook,"This cookbook has good, healthy beef recipes for everyday cooks using mostly common ingredients. Nutrition information for every recipe and lots of color photographs.It also has tips and suggestions for cooking methods and using different cuts of beef. This cookbook would be a welcomed gift for a beginning or experienced cook, male or female. The price was good, too!"
5,Chicago rocks!,"Anyone who thinks Chicago does only ballads should listen to this CD. Chicago proves it can rock with songs such as ""Hideaway,"" Terry Kath's ""Oh Thank You Great Spirit,"" and ""Ain't It Blue."" Other songs include Top 40 favorites ""Old Days"" and ""Harry Truman,"" but it's the songs that rock that really shine on this CD. The CD packaging is poor (in this case it's doesn't exist...no notes) but buy this CD for the music."
2,Not even good for outdoor use,"Indoor and outdoor standards are different, but this doesn't even meet the outdoor standard. Have played basketball for 20+ years and would not recommend."
4,Great ball...,"I really like this ball. I haven't owned my own ball since i was a kid. I miss being able to shoot around so i decided to give myself the opportunity. The ball has good grip, is firm and has decent bounce (could use a little more). Overall i am pleased with this choice."
3,Chicago I a solid Beginning,"It's easy to be lulled to sleep by the proliferation of schmaltzy pop ballads that have been churned out over the decades by this seminal jazz/rock band. And, as result, it's a band that is easily dismissed by many - heck, Chicago still isn't in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, an inexcusable oversight; even if all the band had to be measured by was those schmaltzy power pop ballads, it would still deserve a plaque in the hall. But Chicago is so much more than the hits, as evidenced by this double-disc 1969 debut. Powered by the three-man horn section and the raw guitar style of the late Terry Kath, the band moves smoothly from catchy pop punctuated by jazz riffs (""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"", ""Beginnings,"" ""Questions 67"
4,"Before They Slicked Up, They Kicked Butt","Folks who are only familiar with the radio fodder that was to come, this album will come as a surprise. Raw, rugged, and gutsy, with cuts that take plenty of time to explore ideas instead of chopped down three-minute hits, and some of the best guitar and horn work of its time (When I started out playing trombone, I wanted to be James Pankow when I grew up). And thanks to cd technology, none of us need ever listen to ""Free Form Guitar"" again."
5,the Chicago era that mattered,"I'm thrilled to finally get this classic debut album by Chicago on CD, the double vinyl album now on a single disc. Thankfully, nothing has been chopped up or edited, so fans of the original LP will hear what they remember ... and love. Yes, this was back before the wimpy ballad era, back when the guys in Chicago daringly, and thrilingly, mixed rock and jazz and pop and even psychedelia to create an intoxicating musical brew. This album is all over the place, which I love. You get the hits such as ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is"" ... ""Beginnings"" ... ""Question 67 And 68"", plus some Hendrix-like jamming by Terry Cath on ""Free Form Guitar,"" a great cover of ""I'm A Man,"" and the uplifting ""Prologue."" Hard to imagine a band being allowed such freedom to create an album like this nowadays. This is one to savor."
1,Major Disappointment,"Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Chicago fan. I saw their Christmas concert and wanted to wave my candle and help some young lovely body-surf the audience. I had a few of their albums and didn't think I could go wrong with their first two. I was wrong!This CD is pretentious and self-indulgent. Titles like ""Poem"", ""Free Form Guitar"" (hey, look, I can play, let me show you), and ""Prologue"" should have tipped me off. ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"" is the only cut on the CD that is indicative of things to come. Thankfully they didn't play any of the rest of this hodge-podge in their set.Skip this one, children!"
1,"Oh, Give Me A Break...","Chicago (or, as they were known on THIS album,""C.T.A""): Tuneless songs...amateur vocals.....a horn section that sounded like it was lifted from a Holiday Inn somewhere south of Atlanta, GA... OK, like Milli Vanilli didn't say, ""Girl, You KNOW It's TRUE."" But the one thing that blatantly shows (heck, ""displays,"" or better, ""throws in your face"") just what a bunch of pre-fab commercial nincompoop sludgemongers these creeps were, was their very own self-introduction on the left side of that fold-out album cover: ""With this album, we dedicate our lives and our energies to the (giggle) revolution."" THIS, from the ""band"" that gave you ""Color My World"" and ""Does Anybody Know What Time It Is?"" But re that ""revolution,"" guess I'd better start rolling some bandages or something, huh? OH......you mean there WASN'T a ""revolution?"""
4,Great albumn from the 60's,The digital version works just fine for me. I am pissed however because I cannot send it over to itunes. Send help. Other digital purchases went right over to itunes but not this one.
4,Amusing and clever,"The book is a hoot, although (unsurprisingly) lots of it comes directly from the author's blog. Nevertheless, it's been passed around to all of my friends and we all enjoyed it. Great for dramatic readings at three in the morning, while drinking sangria. Don't be misled by the alarmingly trashy cover. The author is clever, well-read, and perhaps a bit of a nerd. She just happens to like sex, and get paid for it."
1,"Shoiuld be entitled, ""Diary of a Depraved Call Girl""","I intended to buy ""Belle de Jour,"" a fictional book that was written years ago about a married prostitute in France, but decided to read the newer, London based account since I bought it (in error) and paid for it anyway. This is an apparently true account by a depraved London hooker, and I feel that this book has absolutely no redeeming social value. I'm no prude, but I wouldn't want to find myself anywhere near this woman."
2,Same as the blog... but fun if you haven't read it.,"Ditto another reader's observations on this. If you've been reading along with the blog these past few years - the book is an unfortunate duplicate. Or, I should say, 98% is duplicate, but unfortunately, that extra 2% is rather like the extra two minutes on some director's cut of a movie. Doesn't change the story, doesn't change the book itself, and you really could have kept it out - but guess that's what I get for not looking closely before I bought it.Aside from that - if you haven't read the blog, the book is fun. Nothing earthshattering, just leisurely and running occasionally to voyeuristic."
3,Strikes out,"I never finished it. I wanted to read a story of Pete Rose's suspension from baseball and instead got a history of Giamatti's life.If you aren't a diehard, you may want to give this one a miss."
5,Travel Scan Pro 600,Awesome little scanner. I like that it came with cleaning instructions. It came quickly and works great.
5,Down-to-Earth Spirituality Growth,"In typical Cecil Murphey style, the author has once again written from his heart, humbly, sincerely, and effectively, drawing his readers into a deeper yearning for more of God. And he has accomplished this through the easy-reading careful examination of the frailties, failures, and feats of everyday (though sometimes obscure) Bible characters such as Barnabus, Timothy, Mephibosheth, and Hur. ""I want to walk as far up the mountain as the Spirit will take me,"" Murphey declares. After reading Committed But Flawed, I want to do the same."
1,wrong product to image - warning,"You should know that the image displayed here is of the 2004 version of 'Ines De La Fressange, Eau De Parfum', though the product that is supplied is the original version, which is very different in scent.Purely for the fact that the catalogue image here is wrong, this product is 1 star.So far, I'm still waiting for a refund for Beauty Encounter's error, and it has been a month now."
4,Agree with David on this product,"The MZ-R55 is probably a good product, but not the best, nor the lightest, smallest player available. I've bought mine in Japan, the MZ-R90, and it's smaller, lighter, and has a longer lasting battery life. and it looks better too. The size is slightly smaller, but then it really can't get any smaller than the size of the discs, can it? I would definietly wait for the MZ-R90."
3,SIZE AND WEIGHT MAKE IT QUITE DESIREABLE.,"I USE IT TO RECORD OLD LP'S AND CD'S. IT IS SO EASY TO CARRY IN MY SMALL PURSES. I BOUGHT TWO OTHERS. ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND ANOTHER FOR A FRIEND. WE ALL WISH THERE WERE MORE PRERECORDED MUSIC BY CURRENT ARTISTS. DO YOU CARRY ANY? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF SONY AND/OR OTHER COMPANIES MAKE THESE UNITS, THEY WOULD/OR SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO PROCURE PREREDCORDED MINIDISC. IF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY PLACE THAT I MIGHT PURCHASE THESE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RATE IT HIGHER."
3,An okay action movie,"I rented this movie a couple of weeks ago because I remember seeing the ending of this movie on TV so I wanted to see the whole thing. The movie was actually pretty good.The movie is about a boy named Alan(Sean Astin) who goes camping with Vic(Kevin Bacon) and 3 other boys and Vic is taking these boys out here to teach them the ways of the wilderness. Things start out pretty well but Vic then starts to push the boys too hard, especially Alan. Vic is trying to teach the boys the best he can but his ways of doing it are a bit rough on the kids. Should the kids stay and be tought by Vic, or should they try to go home? him.I gave the movie 3 stars because some parts of the story were unclear or they weren't very good. But the good points of the movie were the scenery, the music and the action. If you are in to action movies then watch this one!!"
5,Great Movie!,"I just love this movie because of the simple fact that you can watch it over and over and never get tired of it! It's really one of the classic 80's movies.......maybe not the most popular, but who really cares? If you want to watch a movie filled with plot, adventure, scenery and everything else in between, then purchase the DVD!"
1,Disappointed all around ---,"I received this film rather quickly from the seller;However, the case for the tape was damaged and the stickers were falling off of the tape itself. The quality of picture and sound were close to that of watching a filmstrip. After about an hour into the film, just as it was about to reach a climax, it stopped and began to rewind. Part of the movie was no longer existent on the tape, either because it had been partially dubbed from an original tape or because it was old and not properly taken care of. I do not recommend buying from the seller, chalkybird, but I highly recommend the movie, ""White Water Summer"", a classic that gets 5 stars from me."
1,This is not what you think!,"This package is not a collection of the Halloween series movies. It is actaully a collection of 5 ""B"" horror movies :- Mother's Day- Blood of Ghastily Horror- Dracula vs. Frankenstein- Rockabilly Vampire- Killer Condom..."
2,refunds,This tassel arrived but it was not what I wanted. I returned it by registered mail and am now waiting for a refund. I called to inquire about my refund but they said it was up to Amazon not Luxury Lane to refund my order. Am I being taken? I don't know. I will call again today. It seems to m e they should call Amazon to see my returned item should be credited to my account.
5,Blast from the past.,"I bought this album way back in '95 and lost it when I went off to college in '97. Having finally replaced it, I've found Dubstar still sounds awesome. Really, I think this captures 90s pop at its best--just before the teenie bopper thing took off. I think I'll get their other albums..."
2,Repeating your name is not rapping.,"This CD has great beats, but I couldn't enjoy the CD because he (MIKE JONES)says (MIKE JONES)his (MIKE JONES)name(MIKE JONES)every other word. As I couldn't figure out what his name was on his CD.I couldn't really tell if he had any rhyme skills because he repeats his name and phone number through out the album. Give him a call 281-330-8004 because he needs a job since he ran out of every strip club in Houston that suposedly played his cuts.Burn the CD before you buy it."
3,"""Mike Joooooones!!!!""","I bought this cd today and i gotta say that its ok. I don't think i would have liked it if it wasn't the screwed and chopped version though b/c this dude is so annoying with this ""Mike Jones!!"" crap every 5 minutes. But I'm a fan of the chopped and screwed sound so i can tolerate him just so i can feel the beats. He's not the best rapper, but there are alot of other dudes out there that are worst. Oh, and i gotta admit that ""Still Tippin'"" was the only reason i got this cd cause i've been saying ""who is Mike Jones?"" for a long time now. But thanks to him i won't ever forget his freakin' name no more!! 3 stars for the producers. One Love"
1,worse rapper award goes to who mike jones,"this is sad a disgrace for hiphop houston had better rappers back in the day geto boys, tmt, big mike, big mello, ganksta nip, terrorists, klondike kat,devin the dude, 5th ward boyz, tela now we get clowns like mike jones tired of seeing ignorant fools show their gold teeth reminds me of bill robinson, and stepin fetchit they sure would lovbe grills if they was living today mike's music sucks all he does is repeat himself over and over and who wanna call your cel phone I dont."
1,mike jones is fake,"the guy talks on every track how he is all about his fans, but the first time i go to see him in a show, he ""misses his plane"". I've been listening to mike jones for three years, have all of his underground cds, runnin da game, king of the street, ballin underground and this album too. I threw them all away today. i paid 25 bucks to see him in denver and drove an hour out of my way, and he didnt even show. who is gonna be your fan when u dont show? who?"
1,terrible just terrible,wow.... i like how he says his name a milloin times and his cell phone number like another 1000 times....... no thanks id rather pick up chamillionaire mix tape mesiah.
4,A head banger,"I love his style and what he has to say, he is really insightful and philosophical in a hood way."
1,MUSIC IS GOOD BUT LYRICS ARE THE SAME OL,"THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!! HE YELLS MIKE JONES THROUGH THE WHOLE CD, HE TALKS ABOUT THE SAME OL BULLISH ""HOW HE CAME UP"" THE BEATS ARE TIGHT......BUY THE INSTRAMENTAL"
1,who?.....cares!,should've just put out the instrumentals bun b is the only one who rips on this album.
2,Mike didn't tell us who he is!,"I give props to Mike Jones for coming up with an idea (respectively his grandma). The cd's title ""Who Is Mike Jones?"" made me think/hope that the supposedly talented MC would rip the mic apart and tell us some real lifetime stories (supported by great southern beats). The fact is that with the exception of ""Back Then"" (which has a great beat), ""5 Years From Now"" (This Song Actually Has A Message) and the heartfelt ""Grandma"" none of my expectations were fulfilled. Four things make this cd barely listenable:1.Repeating phrases2.Constant bragging3.Annoying voice4.Mike Jones, Who?If you wanna stick to the south get some Scarface, Ludacris, T.I. or OutKast , but avoid this. Sorry Mr. Jones, but please think it over (and give me my money back)."
5,Phenominal,"I only listened to the first 7 songs and I was hooked. The beats are banging. But the Lyrics are out of this world. I didnt expect this from a Southerner. Most southerners lyrics suck. But this is one of the best albums I have heard. I twas definitely worth the 3 year wait. I thiught this album was going to be O.K. with Still Tippin being the best song. But there are some better songs than that like Back Then, Scandalous Hoes, Got It screwed Up, Screw Dat, Cuttin, Know what I'm Saying, N**** You Need, and Grandma. Nothing else to say but BUY THIS ASAP. Buy It along with Pastor Troys Faceoff Part 2. That was a great album that is fairly new. I t came out in the beginning of March. Get both of them NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Nice, but far from being great","Would have earned a 4, but Mike, baby, stop saying your name pleaseeeeeee. Like I said in my title it's decent, most definitely some good sh*t to ride to, but in the end it's just average. Beats and productions, average - lyrics, slightly below average - overall average. Cop this for some decent riding music this summer. 3 stars ***"
1,Back then...,"Back then they didn't want you, well guess what....we still dont want you! Anyone who seriously considers Mike Jones a quality rapper should be shot in the chest plate.....immediatly!!!!!"
1,WHO? DIKE JONES,"DONT' WASTE UR MONEY ON DIS ALBUM. DIKE JONES IS GARBAGE. HE'S WEAK HIS LYRICS R WEAK. JUS LISTEN 2 HIS MIXTAPES AN YOU'LL HEAR DA SAME THING ON HIS ALBUM. STILL TIPPIN CAME OUT LIKE IN 2002. ASK ANY BODY DAT BANG SCREW. AND IF DIS ALBUM GO PLATINUM RAP IZ DEAD. YA NEED 2 GET THAT SLIM THUG ""ALREADY PLATINUM"" AND CHAMILLIONAIRE ""SOUND OF REVANGE"". WHEN THEY DROP. DIKE JONES WHO DIKE JONES"
1,Mike Jones - Underground Rap ?? Hardly....,"The only thing that shines on this album is the occasional dope beat -- everything else is worthless -- by the way Amazon... where do you get these Reviewers who give editorials about albums ?? I think you should start drug testing soon because your employees are obviously high while they are working...Oh yeah back to this album.... it sucks -- if i could give it 0 Stars i would have... but i guess it deserves 1 star for that ""Still Tippin"" beat -- its dope -- but the people who rap on this album should all be shot and tortured like POW's... but seriously who does Paul Wall think he is ?? Flashin his gayass gold teeth -- i mean come on.... He is an insult to white people everywhere -- YOU ARE WHITE -- ACT WHITE .... and while your at it -- take like a decade off to work on your lyrical game because your making the rap industry look bad...thats my word -- PEACE"
1,"Who is Mike Jones?, Who is this Bad Album","Who is Mike Jones * StarThis is a dreadful houston rap album from the same place that gave us the brillant scarface, there is only one good song and that is Still Tippin, otherwise everything else is so bad, that I'm placing it on my list of the year's worst album, jones's rapping is horrible, the writing is useless, the lyrics are pre-school and the beats (except still tipping) are preposterous.So Thumbs Way down for Me on Who is Mike Jones."
1,WHO? WHO? Mike Lame?,"Man, we know your name. Your lame.H-Town rap is gone to crap.Go get some A-TOWN rap, because we got the rap game on lock!Go grab the new Youngbloodz album Ev`rybody knows me! Or get the T.I. urban legend album. They are actually worth your money!"
4,This c d is alright,"ppl dont listen to those whack reviews. I had this cd for a while and its alright. People that reviewed this cd may said that its whack, mike jones says his name to many times, he's annoying, but they dont know nothing, the man is just trying to get paid ,its a hard knock life. Haters out there dont relize that this cd went platinum so really the cd is getting much love. O yea the beats on this cd is killa!!P.S.: To all you haters and losers that review this album bad, like mike jones quoted on his cd, ""All you haters haten on me, thanks a lot yall help me out!!"" Thats on the # 11 track . (Get the cd ppl) WHO! MIKE JONES!"
4,"Pretty nice album, sum dont but i think its good...","sum says that mike jones sucks but hes good, they said that he always repeat his name but i think its cool and it makes him original. And the things that he say are tru for those who say not... the best songs are back then, still tippin and flossing. I like the way he talk and hes songs are goods. The only thing s bad is the lasts songs and sumtimes he repeat 2 times or maybe 3 times the same lyrics... but anywyas u should buy this album"
1,Do NOT Buy This,"I just want to let anyone who is thinking of buying this that it is a cheap piece of crap. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular for the price, but I at least expected an intact item. Well what I got was a cheaply made, scratched up, mostly non assembled & what was assembled was done so incorrectly, BIG DISAPOINTMENT. I'm not sure it is even SAFE for a child to play with. BUYERS BEWARE...DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,Color Blind & Cheaply Made....,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with Channy Lynn... The guitar was to be for Christmas, and we had to close it back up in the box and send it back as it came Red not Pink and was made so poorly, it was not worth the $29.95! Target carries an adorable pink one for the same price, oh, not sure if I can advertise, just trying to help others out if you ordered this and are stuck at the last minute to get a ""Pink"" guitar. Good Luck."
4,PC User,"Never thought I would be good at making minor changes to family photos until I tried this product. Easy to learn, easy to use. Now my whole family uses this product."
4,Photodeluxe 2.0 compatability,"I had Adobe Photodeluxe for my old PC and loved it. Now, with current upgrades I own a Windows 7 PC. My review is more of a question. Is Photodeluxe 2.0 compatable with Windows 7?Adobe Photodeluxe 2.0 [Old Version]"
2,Most tracks are garbage,"This album is in my girlfriend's dad's collection. Most of the songs are teenie 60s Whitey-McWhite romance pulp. (I love you; you know I'll be true etc) A few classics on the album, but I can't believe how many stars people are giving it."
4,Give 'em some slack,"I know a lot of folks think this one is a stinker but it ain't if you take the time to put it into context of where the band was at when they recorded it. There is a festive ""let's not take ourselves too seriously quite yet"" attitude that makes this a charming album. Keith's crazy outlook on it all influenced the songwriting of Pete, Roger & John and you can hear his off-kilter viewpoint throughout. I'm biased because I must have listened to this album a thousand times when it came out in the 60s but it still brings a joyful smile to my face when I hear the opening notes to ""A quick one"" ""Cobwebs and strange"" and ""Whiskey Man."" No, it doesn't compare with their later works but any true Who fan needs to have this in their collection. The alternate version of Happy Jack included here is fine with me because the hit single version is available on numerous compilations and not really missed here at all."
2,outdated,"I don't know why they haven't written a revision, but this book has severely outdated, dangerous advice about newborns/infants. Advocates scheduling 3-4 hours between feedings (regardless of bottle or breast), leaving a newborn to cry it out in the middle of the night so they will learn who's boss (you are allowed to give them water though, but no feedings ha!). It's good for a laugh if you know anything about current advice regarding babies. I'm only giving it two stars because I feel like I shouldn't give it one just based on a couple chapters, *some* parts of the book are helpful. They are still publishing this book, so they really need to be held accountable for this dangerous advice if they aren't going to write a revision."
5,Great Book with practical advice.,"This book is full of information on child rearing, even though the book was written in the early 80s, every word is relevant for today. This book also has Biblical references, which I love. I plan to pass this book along to my son and his wife who are expecting their first child. I highly reccomend this book."
4,Worth the Read...,"Home Grown Kids is a great resource for encouragement and advice for new parents and seasoned parents, too. I enjoyed the reasoning behind the choice to keep children at home for education. I was slightly surprised to read the authors' decision to highlight the progression of growth from birth through the various stages of childhood. I think this book will help the skeptical parent who isn't sure about homeschooling, and may also need help in learning about how children ""work"" best in their differing stages of development."
5,Just like new,Relatively easy to install and has been cranking the cold air for the last few weeks on my 2001 Ford Escape.
2,"Some Stars, Some Duds","We bought this CD thinking it was from the ""Tribute to Heroes"" telethon. NOT! Some of the recordings are beautiful (Celine Dion's ""God Bless America"" among them), but there are a lot of duds that I find myself hitting the NEXT button on the CD player. Frank Sinatra may have been great in his day, but the recording sounds very dated and tinny. Should have been re-mastered. If it wasn't for the fact that proceeds from sales are going to the Twin Towers fund, I would really regret having paid money for this falsely advertised CD, but at least it was for charity."
5,A Beautiful Tribute,"This was an excellent CD, I'm glad I purchased it. I love all the artist on this cd, and the songs."
5,Blown away.....,"I am not a Celine Dion fan normally, but stumbled onto this mix for many of the other titles on this CD. The brief download does not give her version of God Bless America justice. This arrangement builds slowly, eliciting ""what the heck are you listening to?"" comments and grows until anyone in listening range has goose bumps. I played it while stopped for hours on the freeway in front of Moore Park College where the long lines formed for Ronald Reagan's casket review and people on the side of the road actually gathered around the car and asked me to replay it. A must for any fan of patriotic music."
5,"""A startling, inspirational anthology...""","Ciuraru asks 68 well-known poets, ""What poem has haunted you, provoked you, obsessed you, made you want to speak back to it?"" In response, each writer provides one example and a short essay. The results are at once magical and mundane[...] FIRST LOVES--intense, unsentimental--is a startling, inspirational anthology. -Ken Tucker"
3,"more of the same, but I laughed","Same as the earlier volumes, I laughed, but still not as funny as the guy in Tennessee who invented the character."
4,pretty good,"This cd is pretty good. You get a good variety of songs. There are songs you can dance to, and songs you can just chill and listen to."
1,Glad I get to return it!,Tried to buy a different CD at a local store and ended up with this one instead. Boy is it awful! Stay away!
2,Worst in the series,"Very disappointing...I didn't really like the Penguin's character to begin with but this video really doesn't help his cause all that much. I love the animated series and have collected all of them. I watch them with great interest but this one actually put me to sleep...I guess I can't really describe how boring these episodes were with words. If you would like to see the lamest episodes..please be my guest..but if you would like to see how great this animated series really is..check out the riddler, batman and practically any other tape...sorry WB..this one just didn't make the cut and should be given away in a buy one get one free sort of deal..what a waste of money..how sad for such a good collection of tapes...."
3,not much substance,"Joe Mad's run on the Uncanny X-Men is collected here, but I own at least two issues of Uncanny that did not see print in this trade. The art is fantastic, and the characters seem larger than life, but I felt that the story lines were stale. Also, this isn't a collection of a story arc, merely a collection of selected issues of his stint. As a result, there is no real coherence to the stories and reading each chapter feels like starting over almost. If you really like Joe Mad's artwork, then by all means purchase this trade, but if you would like to also read a continuous story also, I suggest Joe Mad's ""Battle Chasers: A Gathering of Heroes."""
1,30 second 1-time alarm!,This clock looks great but functionally it is terrible. An alarm clocks main purpose is to wake you up. This clock has a quiet alarm that is on for 30 seconds and then the alarm turns off automatically never to sound again for that day.I purchased this for the time zone feature but the alarm is so poor I cannot use it. It was wasted money.
5,A first-rate overview of the band's Columbia Records years.,"Group Portrait is an excellent overview of Chicago's years recording for Columbia Records. Featuring some of the finest jazz-rock of the '70's, the set takes one from the early rock years of ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is"" and ""25 or 6 to 4"", including the beautiful ""Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon"" (which features the hits ""Make Me Smile"" and ""Colour My World""), through the mellower mid-70's hits, such as ""Wishing You Were Here"" and ""Old Days"", and on to the late-70's/early-80's numbers such as ""Gone Long Gone"", ""Thunder and Lightning"", and the haunting ""Song For You"". Included in the set are two tracks that have never seen album release, ""Closer To You"" (a former B-side) and ""Doin' Business"" (which sees its first-ever release with this set). For the avid fan, these are gems from the band. All in all, Chicago's Group Portrait is as fine a ""portrait"" of one of the 70's most popular band as you'll ever find."
1,no title,"One of the silliest books I've read in a long time, worse even than Sherwood Anderson's ""Many Marriages"". Richard Parrish, at 38, has not attained the emotional development of a teenager, and Alice is an utter inane wimp for loving him. She is nothing more than a doormat. This is certainly NOT a woman's novel, but Parrish borders on just plain unbelievable. Rita Coventry seems more real than either of them. Sort of reminds me of ""Black Oxen"" and ""Tower of Ivory"", both by Gertrude Atherton, in its depiction of New York Society and opera. Especially the dinner parties of the upper crust. Plot was soooo predictable, it was pathetic. No wonder this book was hard to get. It deserves to be forgotten. Terrific emphasis on interior decoration. Almost as if Street were himself a decorator, rather than a writer."
5,Excellant series a must read for anyone interested in Isreal,"I would highly recommend that you purchase all five books in the series at the same time. I read the first one and was hooked. Each book ends as a cliff hanger for the next one. They are historically accurate, and you feel you are living through the struggle of the people of God to establish a homeland. As a non Jewish reader, I learned a great deal and would highly recommend this series."
3,Beats Some of the Alternatives,"Ehrlich's use of ""cuckoos"" as a rating system is just pejorative and obnoxious. If this book were intended as a serious attempt at getting the popular audience to consider offbeat ideas, think for themselves, and examine data, Ehrlich would have chosen something neutral, such as stars.Another deficiency is its limiting the scope to ideas that haven't been accepted, rather than including ideas that have recently come into acceptance (such as the preClovis sites like Monte Verde), or even ideas which are considered established despite substantial evidence to the contrary (such as ""plate tectonics"").As other reader reviewers have noted, Ehrlich rates Gold's abiogenic hydrocarbon theory quite highly. Because of that rating, I'd rate this book as probably worth a look."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this cd. The first couple of songs are good, but the guitar never changes. I get tired of the same guitar after the third song and can't make it through the entire cd. Every song ends up sounding too alike."
3,Dissatisfied,"You sent the product to the wrong address where it was returned to you as undeliveraable. We had typed in that it should be sent to our winter address and not our home address in PA. So, you got it back and alledgedly have given us credit on our MC. Since then we have responded to your e-mails and requested that you re-enter the order and send it to our current quarters to no avail. This has not been a good experience. Fortunately, TCM was playing the movie the other morning and we copied it on VHS and we have found someone who will copy the particular scene that we need to practice for our show onto another tape and we don't need you now."
2,"Nice songs, stupid plot, Fred Wastes His Skill","""Shine on your shoes"" song is very cool, and I also liked ""Triplets"" which I have seen Danny Kaye sing in a mirrior, but all in all ""The Bandwagon"" is confusing and talent is wasted fluently by namely, Nanette What's-her-name, and Fred Astaire. The ""Girl Hunt"" number"" was funny in it's stupidness."
3,"OK, but not great","It's interesting to see Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in ""The Band Wagon"" playing characters so similar to themselves.But they don't explain why the show-within-the-movie is titled ""The Band Wagon.""We also aren't shown how the musical numbers of the show-within-the-movie fit in with its plot."
3,Decent product,"Nice product, It was hard to determine which side of the tape held the recordings I taped. A little frustrating but hey, it works."
2,A Great Forgotten Band,"Creation released this album after their sucess with the single Painter Man and it would get a four, however you no longer need this one with the release of Making Time And Biff Bang Pow Having all the essental tracks so it only gets a two."
2,price outrageous,"Why in the world would anyone pay $80 for a CD? This must be a typo. I like Bub Roberts, but give me a break, he ain't Clapton."
5,Definetly a right to the title The Best of Bond!,"When most people think of Bond, it's the chicks and gadgets.Well this CD explores the music of Bond, just as important to the movies as anything else.It expands from the 1962 debut of the classic James Bond theme of Dr.No, to our present's more hop boppin' music style by Sheryl Crow.This CD spans music from the early 60's, the 70's,80's,and 90's giving you their top numbers on the Uk and US charts. Not only does this CD have great music from all time favorites such as Louis Armstrong and Paul McCartney & Wings, but it also has detailed summaries about each movie without giving away their heart-stopping endings as well as short bios on the actors who played them. I recommend this CD for all people who like music and definetly to any James Bond fanatic..."
4,This is the best of Bond... James Bond,"This disk contains all the Bond themes until Tomorrow Never Dies. The best songs are the latest, but some of the old ones are good too. It's just that the newest songs that are The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day aren't on this disk."
4,Great little vacuum,"I do like this vacuum a lot, we found it picked up a whole canister full of dirt, pet hair, and etc. after we first got it and ran it over our floors. I appears to do a great job and for the money, can't beat it! I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good maching at a lower price."
5,Believe the hype,"As I was shopping for a new vacuum I started by comparing the 'Dyson' refurbished models, according to the reviews they were not worth the money even though they were reduced prices for refurbished. Then I came across a few testimonies on the 'Dirt Devil' and how powerful it was. The price was reasonable so I ordered it and I am not sorry. In fact I probably would have paid more. The very first time I tried it I couldn't believe how much dirt it picked up. When my brother or my boyfriend used the vacuum they were shocked that it was more powerful than they expected. My only real criticism is that to use the hand-held attachments you literally have to disconnect a tube and reroute the suction to the attachments. Other than that little detail it really is worth the cost and then some. I have a medium pile, light colored carpet and it looks really good after I vacuum."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"This vacuum gets so hot after running for just a couple of minutes that it smells and smoke starts comming out of the filter area. I have two young children so it takes more than a couple on minutes to vacuum. Another thing I can't stand is the darn thing is always clogged and has to be taken apart. The cord drags on the floor and getts tangled. I always thought that Dirt Devil was such a great brand but I think I will be trying something else. I am afraid that this thing is going to start a fire the next time I use it.If you are thinking of buying this vacuum, don't spend your money on something better."
2,Powerful but a pain,"Pro - Very powerful vacuum that picks up enough to require the large canister to be emptied after every use, at least for our house. And the price is great.Cons - Poor design that makes it a pain to empty. The hepa filter IS IN the dust canister! Therefore, every time I empty the canister (see above) I have to take the large hepa filter out and bang it against the outdoor trash can for a whole minute to clear out all the lint that gets imbedded into the filter's ridges. The worst part is trying to hold my breath long enough to do it. I got fed up with it and finely bought a different vacuum."
1,"Flowery, predictable drivel","I would normally not read Barbara Taylor Bradford but my boyfriends' Mom gave it to me as part of a present, so I said what the heck, I'll try it.Just as disappointing as I'd expected. Light, uninteresting, and with no real plot or ending. As for the historical pages, read Catherine Cookson instead.I may go back and listen to A Woman of Substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it.But this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things, and full of too-successful, too-beautiful men and women. Not believable."
1,Emma's Secret,"I loved Bradford's Woman of Substance it was a book that kept me awake until the wee hours of the morning, I literally couldn't put it down. In Emma's Secret it appears she didn't have anything else to write about so she rehashed the orginal and it was boring certainly not up to her usual standards, I expect more from a Bradford book. I am sorry I bothered with this one."
2,Empty,this was a waste of time and money..seems Ms. Bradford could have told the story in 12 pages...written on a 4'th grade level with entirely too many descriptions and a dialoge that was pitiful...why do so many authors not quit while they are ahead?
1,Very disappointed,"I totally agree with Empty of 2/13/04.There were too many people, too much description of clothes, etc. and not enough plot. This book was so contrived! No ending! I think the author just wants to make money. A Woman of Substance was good. She should have stopped there."
1,FFFFFFFEEEECCCCCCKKKKKKKK,HiI have boghtCalvin Klein - CK Ladies Watch Flash K3424104 for 3 mouth ago but is feckin the Product Specifications say Water resistance 30 meter but I wear is and wash the dish at home the water just come in Easy .I will not gona buy anything from here FFFFFFFFFFFFFFeeeeeeeeeCCCCCCCCCCCkkkkkkkkkkkkkagain .FFFFFFFFFFFFFFeeeeeeeeeCCCCCCCCCCCkkkkkkkkkkkkkFFFFFFFFFFFFFFeeeeeeeeeCCCCCCCCCCCkkkkkkkkkkkkk
5,"not a detailed book, but interesting","I bought this book before my first son and found it interesting. There are some ideas in it that are far-fetched, but still thought-provoking. The part that really stood out to me was the gender selection at the beginning of the book. My friend had had two boys and was thinking of trying for a third child (she wanted a girl). She followed the diet and lo and behold, had a girl. I just had my second son and if I can convince my husband to have a third child, I'll try the diet too. This book is not a pregnancy bible, more of just a study aid. Still, I learned a few things and did enjoy the pictures."
3,A bit deceiving,"We expected that there would be a page or two dedicated for a specific week. What we found is that a few weeks of development are summarized in 2 or 3 pages. We got this book because we expected to see specific photos for each week. Instead, there is one photo that covers several weeks. We got the book specifically for the photos so less illustrations and more real photos would be nice. vag118@cheerful.com"
4,A Good Listen,"The sound is a little over-synthesized which makes it sound dated, but beneath all the electronica are some good Robert Lamm songs. ""My Neighborhood"", ""When Will The World Be Like Lovers"", ""Murder On Me"", ""In This Country"" all stand out for me. If you're a Robert Lamm fan (and I am) this rates about four out of five stars. If your a casual listener, I'd guess it to be about three stars. Overall, I'd say the album is a good listen."
2,be careful !,"I bought this album on the recommendation in a review that this was THE BEST version of ""Grateful"". I felt that John Bucchino did a better job, more feeling, on his own album entitled Grateful. ALSO ... most important !! DO NOT listen to this CD if you are prone to depression or are in a depressed state."
5,Candlebox is amazing!!!,This band is excellent on CD and live on stage! I have seen them twice live and both times I came out loving their music even more. The whole band just plays so well together. I just don't understand why they just dropped out of radio and video sight. Happy Pills is just as amazing as Lucy and the debut CD. They kick ass....
3,"Paid A Buck For It, Then Gave It Away","The conventional wisdom is that Nirvana smashed metal with `Nevermind' and the genre disappeared during most of nineties. The success of Candlebox and especially the track `Far Behind' prove this notion to be a myth. Metal bands of the time simply pretended to be alternative bands. Fans of Guns N Roses, Metalica and Aerosmith will probably enjoy this album, as will fans of heavy alternative bands like Jane's Addition, Temple Of The Dog and Alice In Chains. It's Ok for metal."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I didn't even get that this band was supposed to be NYHC on their last album, because the production was so slick and alternative sounding. I took them as a bunch of alt-rock kids playing at being hardcore, and not entirely getting the point of the genre, so it's kinda weird to realise I had it completely backwards. Now I guess I need to ask what a genuine NYHC band are doing trying to sound so commercial. Either way the songwriting is still mediocre."
2,"""you were supposed to be invincible....""","a very disappointing release from MPB. i guess i expected too. the singers no tom sheehan. if you are looking for a good ol ""nothing in vain"" sound you wont find it here. this album just seems inferior in every way. dont let the free mp3 ""shark ethic"" on trustkill fool you, thats not what the album sounds like. if it did i wouldnt be so upset with the new sound."
4,Easy to use---accurate---Less wieght,I have brought this product recently. I like this product very much as it is very easy to use as per the instructions. It is also very accurate if properly measured following the instructions.
2,Not my favourite product,"Even though I had this monitor checked and calibrated at the hospital I worked at (and they found it satisfactory), I've not been all that pleased with it because of the number of failed readings. It could be because I am overweight and this may be suited to a more slender wrist."
5,Lennie in a Solo Vein,"This is a fine album. Definitely should be in the collection of any devotee of LT's music. Lots of heart in this album, just like the photo suggests. Swing. Feeling. Intelligence."
2,Thought it would be funnier,"I am looking for a new author to enjoy (I like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series a lot). So, when I saw this book, I thought it would be really good - it was only okay. Yes, it has some entertaining areas - but I thought it took a little bit long to get to the fact that someone had been murdered...maybe I need to practice a little more patience, but I wanted to know what they were looking for sooner!I did finish the book, so that bodes well - I am wondering if it I would have enjoyed it more if I started with the first in the series."
4,Using for 5th and 6th grade Sunday School,This is a book for children that will help them understand Revelations. They were asking a lot of question and wants to study the bible book. This will help them. Written for children in an fun way.
5,The Master Strikes Again,"Scott Henderson has always been a true original among countless copycats. This CD reminds me of his influences filtered through his own original style. From Hendrix to Stevie Ray to Jeff Beck to Michael Landau. In fact, there are moments where it sounds like a long lost Landau project. Either way it's an unpredictable journey through unUrthly tone, taste and feel. But that is how I would describe every Henderson/Tribal Tech CD."
4,Gauge...,"I did not have the chance to use this product, yet.But I am happy with the quality and the assembly of product..."
5,Soleus LX140,We have used this unit to air condition a room without central HVAC. It has worked very well. We will be testing its ability to heat this area this winter.....and I suspect it will work great.
1,JUNK,"I purchased one of these AC/heater units, installed it, only to find out it did not work. Thinking it was a fluke, I returned the unit and exchanged it for a new one. The new one works off and on, showing the error message E3. After calling tech support, they indicated that this unit is also faulty. I will be returning it for a refund and buying a different brand altogether. What a headache!"
1,Stay clear,"I was reading the reviews on this product, and most said to stay clear. Well unfortunately I didn't listen due to that fact that most people like to use items like this on rooms far bigger then the expectation of the manufacturer. Also these things aren't meant to cool the room it was designed for, more than 20 degrees. What i should have listened to was a guy saying that the blower motor went bad after a month. With my horrible luck, I didn't need to wait that long. I was excited because it only took three days for the ac to get here with no additional charge. Which is incredible for bulk items off the internet. I went to home depot and got all the necessary items to install the ac, set everything up and low and behold nothing blows out. Very frustrating to say the least.Stay awaysincerely one unhappy camper"
1,Very poor quality and presentation. Don't waste your money.,What I received was a product of very poor quality and presentation. Very bad welded to the handler. Dirty and cheapest plastic case. It doesn't worth by far what I paid for. A complete deception.
5,Kirby Canvas Curse RULES,"Kirby Canvas Curse is just like Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land and Kirby Amazing Mirror , but instead of moving Kirby he rolls along by himself. While he rolls along happily your 're trying to keep him alive! Kirby Canvas Curse might look easy , but as you get farther it gets even harder . Like Machine Mansion , I got 2 game overs before I could beat it!Kirby Canvas Curse will get harder and harder so if you don't get something I advise youtogo train in training mode before you keep going.You also have medal trade , mini games, rainbow run , and boss battles my favorite boss is King Dedede because you get to race against him on a mine cart. I hope you enjoy it because I like it a lot!"
4,RESCUED,"I really purchased this cd for the song ""Rescue"" which is an awesome worship experience. What I didn't know was the testimony behind the song which caused me to be more in love with it. After listening there were other songs that I found enjoyable."
3,it is just ok,"I believe his single jazz oriented music of the 50s and 60s had more feeling and romance. I like it, just not as much as I thought"
5,"Cheap, Light, and Full of Functions","I bought this watch to replace my old Timex Ironman. I needed a watch that have multiple countdowns, as well as multiple counters, and alarms. if you do interval training, you will find that the multiple countdowns feature is essantial.The watch is very cute and very light. Even though I cannot handle having a watch on my wriste while typing, this watch is so light that it does not bother me at all.I was thinking about buying a Suunto, but for the money the Timex has more desirable features."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,do not buy this item. it's a 450 word article on an architectural photographer. the only thing they don't tell you before you shell out your ten dollars is that they have omitted the images. great commentary of images that i don't get to see. WTF?
1,Not his best work...,"... But even Ted Rall's best work doesn't merit 5 stars. 5 stars should be reserved for the giants of the graphic novel medium, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore etc. I can understand how someone could like 2024, but five stars?!? I mean, come on!I've liked Rall's comic strips. His drawing style is unique and fun, and he's an intelligent guy. He also has a lot of high quality ammunition to fire at this distopian comsumerist/techno crazy society. Yet, 2024 lacked the #1 thing I've gone to his comics for ... humor!Yes, there were a few funny parts, but not nearly enough to justify this much ink shed.As for the politics, I'm afraid he's just going to be preaching to the converted here.Try his web page for his free stuff, and maybe his collections (the worst thing I've ever done) before buying this."
3,Viva America,"This is Elvis at his Vegas best, full orchestration and the backup choir(s). Nice version of America The Beautiful - I bought this CD 'cause I like Elvis and got tired of hearing the Ray Charles version of the song. A decent ""collector"" piece and money goes to a good cause."
4,Get the music videos,"I bought this CD expecting more out of the music. This CD is really about the singing. The music is only there to complement her voice. It is her emotional explorations through music. If you don't understand the underlying emotions, it may not be as interesting. If you like classical, I think that you would like this CD, though.However, I highly recommend the music videos:Bjork - Volumen."
3,httu a stara á mig,"If you're a hardcore björk fan, none of these songs are new. The new ""unreleased"" song ""It's In Our Hands"" was already released on the Vespertine advance promos; apart from Play Dead, the rest are standard album songs. Great choices albeit I could have burned a better compilation myself. Interesting choice of artwork but I'd rather get Family Tree."
5,France Bozeman is an American Treasure,"About 2 weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to meet France Bozeman. He served with my grandfather during WWII. I can honestly say that he is just as interesting and entertaining in print as he is in person. This book is very humorous and informative. It kept my attention from start to finish. I would highly recommend it as a fascinating slice of Americana."
4,cool record...a little more stripped down than his work w chicago,"this album has a great stripped down sound. very soulful and funky w great guitar work from the late great terry kath. the sound isn't very unlike the lamm compositions recorded w chicago (ie Saturday in the park, Does anybody know what time it is).(in fact, a few of these numbers were re recorded w chicago and appeared on chicago albums). also, lamm sounds a little bit like the old billy joel records. definitely check this out if you like old school chicago. the reason i gave three stars instead of five is because there are a few 'filler' number that sort of bored me and had to be skipped over"
1,Tricked,"This product claimed to be useful and powerful by the manufacture and the reviews I read. I found the unit to be bulky, (not good for vehicle use), had weak suction, small capacity, and worse of all the liquid must be sprayed manually (like a cheap squirt gun). This is an extremely tedious and slow process (which hurts your fingers after awhile). I would not recommend this to people who would like an easy and fast time at cleaning up puppy accidents, or spills from a 2 year old. Trading mine in on a Hoover upright."
4,Good basic overview of Viking era - good for teens,"I did learn a few things from this book and, as a general introduction to the entire Viking era it does a good job. There are a few problems with it though. First, there are a few editorial mistakes (inlcuding, it appears to me, a missing illustration - the caption is included and a blank space where an image should be). Second, the maps are not always as interesting to look at as one would hope (although the written information is consistently interesting and enjoyable to read). As a reference book it is very useful and I am happy to have it on my bookshelf. I'm sure I will read it again. I feel bound to point out that I think it would be ideal for teenagers - especially if they are doing an assignment on the topic."
2,VIKING HISTORY,I have read better accounts of Viking history. However I would still recomend it for most readers.
5,First jeans I've found in years that fit me perfectly.,"Bought three pairs, which ought to see me through the next few years. I expect to put a lot of miles on them: Carhartt makes sturdy products."
5,Awesome,"I am a huge fan of the band Seefeel that was popular in the mid-late 90's and discovered Silvania because Seefeel had done a remix for them in a comp called Delay Tambor. This early collection of Silvania's work is very much based on guitars and vocals, half-pop, half-shoe gaze or slowdive style. Some really excellent tracks here, and some so so. I recommend this for anyone that likes poppy, psychedelic music from the 90's (sung in Spanish, a bonus). Great for warm days and cool nights. Their later work is more like Seefeel in that it uses programming and sampling more. Still, this is one great collection (esp. since the actual albums are OOP)."
1,Disappointed,"If the tracks listing, including details on each version, were available, I would not have bought this CD-single which I think it's just a waste of money."
1,Need the KISS recipe book!,"love my grill but have no use for this book! have you ever heard the expression ""Keep it simple stupid""? This book is for Chefs! not everyday people. I can't afford all the ingrediences...even is I knew what they were! If you wonder, I'm 71, live along, and a male. I need something for a noncook!"
2,"Interesting, but","Was this movie worth watching? Possibly, but I wish I'd rented it. Erotic? No, not unless you like seeing the star getting peed on (fully clothed). Brief nudity. No love or tenderness."
5,The spirit of Tao...,"People who have read the Tao Te Ching, and were quite pleased and affirmative about it, and wonder about what (tao-book) to read next, will certainly do themselves a favor to pick up this book one day.The spirit of the Wen-tzu is similar to the Tao Te Ching but it is much more concrete, and therefore a welcome addition.This book has helped me significantly to sense and understand the spirit of Tao.I recommend this to anyone who has a warm heart for the Tao.Tao (as a universal principle) is something which originally and ceaselessly functions without deviation,and it is (as teaching and method) an understanding and practice that is to bring you back right intothat original and ceaseless, impartial functioning.I conclude with a quote:""The Way returns the carved and polished to simplicity.""Enjoy."
2,Product does not work,I bought the battery for my car key. But the remote still does not work with the new battery. Don't know what to do with it.
4,A great book about Native American life past and present,"The Education of Little Tree deserves four stars in my eyes. When you read this book, you learn about Native American life. You learn a lot about Cherokee life I didn't know about before because I had never read any books on Native American's life. This life is very interesting and different from our life and shows it through the eyes of Little Tree. Little Tree is the main character; he moves to live with his grandparent after his parents die. He lives life as a Cherokee boy would live, which is a different life than he has experienced. You see what life was and is like for a Native American living in the United States. You will go on journeys with Little Tree like fishing, going to the market and other places. You will laugh at this book, be saddened by the book but you will never forget this book, I know I won't. So, put this book on your books to read list, if you have one."
2,It was a disapointed book,"My English teacher and my parents said that The Education of Little Tree is a great book to read. I thought I should read the book because all the other books my English teacher recommended to me were books I really got into. I really didn't understand the point to the book of Little Tree learning his lesson, but maybe I misread the whole point. In the end of the book it had more persistence to it because of the adventure and action--that's why I gave it a two. I think adults like this book better than kids do because they understand the book."
5,Heart Warming,"I'm aware of all the controversy around the author of this book, but I truly found it to be a wonderful story.It's funny, clever and heart warming. I must admit that I was a bit teary at the end.Reading the dialogue reminded me of visiting extended family in my youth.I loved the book!"
1,THIS IS AWFUL,The Education of Little Tree was an awful book! It was so boring that it was almost impossible for me to read it. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Inspirational story,"my friend urged me to read this book...jotted down all the tidbits of wisdom..enjoyed the writers vision fantasy or fact??my friend had also begged me not to look up the author or read the introduction which I did not...if you read, please do the same --you will be amazed!"
5,Education for a Senior Citizen,"The book was recommended to me by a Bible Study teacher. I was almost incapable of putting it down until I finished. For a lot of people over 70 years of age, it is a review of their early childhood. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
5,I enjoyed the book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Education Of Little Tree. The book contains many gems of wisdom, is well written, and would be a great book to coax young non-readers into becoming readers. Perhaps not as much as Harry Potter does, eh?I was dismayed to read that Carter could have been a racist-hate-monging-speech-writer. I can't imagine how he could have come up with this book if that were the case. He must have lowered the bucket into some previously unexplored personal well. It's been said that Wagner was an anti-semite, yet people love his music. If we knew the true backgrounds of all writers, poets, composers,etc. we might not like what we find.We are a species capable of achieving great heights and sinking to low depths, sometimes all within one person.Read the book, forget about Carter."
4,my review,"4**** The Education Of Little Tree, by Forrest Carter is about the education of a small American Indian boy in the ways of the Cherokee. I thought that this was an excellent book. It gives us as readers a view of two worlds, that of the Cherokee and that of the white men, as well as what they think of the Cherokee. Forest Carter is truly a great story teller. His books make you want to read more and more. I am a teenager who thinks that it is very hard to find a good book these days, so if you are like me, read this book. This book is very easy to read and interesting. It also opened up my mind to the suffering of the Cherokee and their history."
4,Microsoft Office 97 Professional Review,"This product works well for me. First I had to obtain a good copy. I purcahsed one from a vendor for $23, thinking I made a good deal. After receiving it, it would not work! The vendor also refused to take it back! I then purchased one for $35 & it worked well. I would simply tell others, if the price sounds too good to be true, chances are there is a problem! I use Excel and Word on a daily basis with my job. I know some people want the latest releases, but I simply can not see why I would spend $200 for Office 2003 when I get get this for $35 & it works the same! So I would recommend to anyone, buy one of these and save a fortune. Do not buy a cheap $23 one becasue of my experience, but the mid-priced versions work & I could not be happier."
4,Great product and can be a great value,"Although Office 97 Professional lacks some of the bells and whistles of later versions it is a complete and robust suite that will suit the needs of anyone who doesn't need the absolute latest software. It doesn't seem to support web-based email like Yahoo!, but for the price and compatibility Office 97 Professional is a very good choice."
1,Microsoft Office 97 Pro.,I bout this item thinking it was a full install and in reality it was just an upgrade. Buyer beware this outfit should not be trusted.
3,"Great songs, poor recording",The songs are wonderful and the words very meaningful. I could hear very loud noises on the cd unfortunately.
1,Beware of imitations,"I thought I was getting the Simmons Beautyrest, but got some cheap foam rip off. I sent it back, but beware. They might ship you a cheap foam mattress topper and stick you with it."
2,Not what I expected,"These cupcake holders say standard, but they are smaller than the standard cupcake holder. The color is also extremely pale. They were not what I expected."
1,"Honey, I amplified the noice too.","I lived about 20 miles from the TV towers. I found that the signal is weak. There is always some snow on the analog channels. My digital box shows that the signal strength is about 55%. When I found this antenna, it had 5-star rating.But I am wrong about this. As soon as I turn it on, the snow is all over the screen for the analog channels. For the digital channels, the converter box show the signal is jumping between 0 to 5%. I don't think it will cut off the signal. The only thing I can think of is that it amplifies the noice too.Without turning on the amplify feature, it works the same way as other $10 rabbit ear antennas."
1,Doesn't work worth a damn!,"Researched the internet and picked this one (regretfully). For me it doesn't work very good. Difficulty getting a signal and then if I can the picture won't come in clearly or without lots of lines, etc. Very disappointed and a waste of money for me."
1,The floor are clean but...........,"I didn't buy the Hoover because I don't have many bare floors. Just the kitchen, 3 bathrooms, and a small entrance area. I bought this on sale yesterday at Target and returned it this morning. It did clean well except along the edges and around the toilets after I vacuumed first with my regular vacuum. (The vacuum on this is a joke) I emptied the tank at least 10 times doing just one bathroom and the (small) kitchen. Totally agree with the other reviews. You can hear a change in the motor when the dirty tank is full, then it pours water all over the floor. It falls over when you let go to empty the tank. Cleaning out the filter is gross. Pet hair clogged it within 5 minutes."
4,Pleasently surprised,"I have only made one recipe (chickpea rague), but it was very good and went over well with my meat-and-potatos man. I found the book easy to read (I did not find the font color challenging), and it's quite simple to make subtle ingrediate substitutions. I've used a few of the other recipes as ""inspirations"" behind other dishes I hadn't ever cosidered before. I would recommend it as I'm not exactly a novice in the the kitchen but definitely need lots of help, especially with meal planning. It just forces me to think outside the ""pasta, stir-fry, or chicken"" rut after work."
5,Chicken on mashed cauliflower with red hot salsa,Made the chicken on mashed cauliflower with red hot salsa last night and it was so darn easy! The chicken turned out very moist; since I never cooked chicken breasts that way I was a little hesitant. Thanks for another great recipe from your Fast Food My Way cookbook. Everything I have tried has been delicious.
4,Excellent recipes that a simple and delicious,"Excellent recipes with simple ingredients. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with some of other reviews in that you do need a well-equipped kitchen as well as kitchen skill in order for the food to be ""fast food"". Therefore, for an amatuer cook like myself, certain recipes WILL take longer, but it is worth the extra time. A lot of the dishes are adaptable so I found I was able to substitute with ingredients that I had in the the fridge. In particular, the chickpea ragout and almond cake with berries are amazing."
3,conan recommended,conan recommended this cd b/c of the cover. it actually isn't too bad. songs are pretty laid back. i liked it surprisingly.
4,Connan is the new Oprah,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas along with the Chicken calendar because Connan O'Brian said to and she loves his show. Imagine my surprise when I found out other people did bought this c.d. and the chicken calender too! Wow, he does have some Oprah power."
1,Just Messy,"I thought I could, at least, learn something from the book. After reading through the book, I found it messy. And my choice then is to buy another..."
5,Great jacket!,Great jacket! I use it at work and it's perfect because I have to outside occasionally and it gets a little cold in New York!
3,zipper broken,"This sweatshirt is made of an excellent quality material, but the zipper was broken and it runs very small. Will be returning it for a larger size and working zipper."
5,carhartt thermal lined zip front hoodie,"My husband works outdoors and requested this for his xmas gift. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition. My husband loves this jacket and wears it every day, in spite of the fact that his work provides him outerwear. This is an excellent product."
3,I still missed alot of the oldies!,"I know that Chris Rea was wanting to do a concert full of his favorites and not necessarily the hits that made him famous. Too bad, because as great as he is, I really missed hearing and seeing those tunes! Some of the songs were just kinda boring, they didn't have the magic of his earlier hits. Don't get me wrong, the guy is an awesome guitarist and singer.... it just felt a little flat. Also, the quality of the concert footage looked dull.... it lacked crispness. But, considering there's not as much video of this guy from over the years as some other artists.... I'll still take it! Chris Rea should have been way more famous in the States than he is today!!"
4,Vato Punk Rock,"Take the lead singer from the Cadillac Tramps, add some buddies and cover classic punk songs with a Mexican twist. There you have Manic Hispanic. This is a fun album to listen to. Covered here are songs by the Clash, the Damned, X, Black Flag and others. Jet Muchacho, East LA and Medley alone are worth the price. Hopefully they will reissue this album as it is really hard to find. Also check out their other album the Recline of Mexican Civilization, which is even better than this."
2,Different stokes for Different folks,"A little less than i expected. Not necessary a good look for such a nice piece of equipment. Made the Palm Pilot look pretty cheap. But if you really, really need a change of pace, they are not the worst product you could buy. Plus they give you 3 extra stylists and Graffiti Alphabet stickers."
2,Not worth the money,"I think I would rather have one of the manual, push sweepers for small jobs.This vacuum was broken within a few months of use. The more I read about Dirt Devil, the more I hear that they break quickly. Think twice before you spend the money on this one."
4,Dirt Devil 083414,"Pleased with this cleaner. It does a really good job for a 'lightweight'. Bought it to deal with a pet hair problem and it does an excellent job -- mostly on tile floors but does a good enough job on the surface of area rugs. Lightweight, easy to push-pull. Charge sufficient for our 1,800 sq ft house. Cordless is a great advantage in the quickly daily clean-up round."
1,Worst vaccuum ever,I bought this model and have used it twice and I'm taking it back for a refund. It doesn't pick up much of anything and if you lift from the floor anything it picked just falls out.
1,Not Recommended at all,Very poor performance. Not worth the money. Not even good for lightweight use. I do not recommend buying this.
4,Pretty good!,"I've had the sweeper for about a month now. For the price, AND it being a cordless model, I think it works pretty good. I wanted the convenience of a cordless model for picking up quickly and sweeping the rug at the front door. It picks up dog hair and dirt that's been tracked in pretty good.Make sure to clean out the filters regularly. I don't know if you're ""supposed to"", but I rinse them out every few uses - works great."
2,Picks up Great....For 5 minutes,"I loved this vacuum initially. You can even see how much dirt it's picking up! However, the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately, to where the vacuum won't pick up a speck of lint. You ahve to empty the filter every 5-10 minutes. I do NOT have a terribly messy household, just one with no stairs going to the front & backyard."
4,Power Stick Vac,Have used this product for approx 1 month and it works pretty much as advertised. Excellent for hardwood and tile floors; less good for carpet.
3,Dirt Devil,"This vacuum picks up very well, but the dust cup is very small. You need to dump it after each job. It also won't stand up by itself, but you can always lean it on something. The dust cup has a good filter system."
4,One of the best!,"Over the past few years, I have had several cordless vacs. This is one of the best. My only negative comment would be no side vac. The most positive, is the length of time the charge last, and the suction. I love this cordless vaccum."
2,I thought that it was good,I've had this vacuum for about a year and am now replacing it. The battery barely holds a charge long enough to vacuum all my floors and it really doesn't have much suction to begin with. The brush only works sporadically and it has never worked on carpet. I love how easy it is to manuever. It's very light and being cordless is so nice but it's not worth it because of the lack of power. I'd rather have a vacuum that does the job.
2,buy a real vacuum trust me,"this sort of works for a little bit but it definitely doesnt vacuum like a real one. It loses suction very quickly, in like 3 minutes, because the dust will build up. After a years use, mine wont even pick up any dirt at all."
1,Returning this,"We have a several year old Eureka stick vac that works very well, but the battery is holding less and less of a charge. I requested a new cordless for Christmas for the upstairs. My husband got me this, based on the Consumer Reports rating. But even though they said it is excellent on carpet, it's not. We have three oriental rugs in our bedroom, and a long-haired dog that sheds. While this unit clearly picked up some dog hair (you could see it in the cup) it also left a lot on the rugs (unlike the Eureka). I may try the Bissell sweeper, or possibly just invest in a new battery for the Eureka."
5,"Exceeded Expectations (which were, admittedly, low)","I had reasonably low expectations for this product. If it could let me clean up under my daughter's high chair after dinner without lugging out the big vacuum cleaner I would be happy. It does that, and it sweeps my tile and wood floors better than the swiffer! Not good for ""real"" cleaning, but great for pick up jobs. Very happy."
5,I've Tried The Others...,"... and the Dirt Devil Power Stick is by far the best cordless vacuum on the market. It's better than the Eureka (three stars) and much better than the Oreck (zero stars). The Power Stick is well made, easy to use and it really works, picking up dust and dog hair that these others left behind. The dust receptacle IS too small, but that's a minor inconvenience when you consider that this machine really works as advertised. The pivoting brush head is easy to navigate around furniture and the carpet brush switches on and off from the handle for area rugs. And charging is a breeze -- just set the unit down on its charging platform. If you want convenience, quality and performance, buy the Dirt Devil!"
4,Dirt Devil Works Great,We use it on both hard floors and carpets. It is powerful and easy to manuver. It is perfect for a second vacuum to do a quick cleaning job.
3,Handy,It has kind of a high pitched squeal (still scares the dog like the 12 amphoover windtunnel i have lugging around) when its running and the engine sounds like its going to die when I use it. It was charged when I got it & hasnt gone dead yet. Picks up pet hair well. A lot handier to pick up & use in a hurry without tripping over cords. The thing I hate....is that to empty the cup (which it seems like you have to clean after every use or it sounds weak) you have to stick your fingers in the dirty filter to lift it out to empty the cup. Stupid design. It looks nasty after less than 10 uses. I almost returned it the first time I used it because I couldnt open it.
3,No edge cleaning,"We are returning this item. It was to replace our Shark stick vac which had such flimsy handle that we broke 2 of them. However, the Shark had a brush to edge clean, very helpful to clean the toe kick area under our kitchen counters. This Dirt Devil model does not have that feature, so it wouldn't clean well in that area."
3,decent,For the money no complaints but there are other brands/models that have a hand held built in that comes off the main unit. NIce ot have osmethig you cna just grab and vac - no cords. Could esily be your only vac in small apt.
2,only for easy small particle situations,"It is a lightweight compact machine. For simple pickups it is probably great, but I needed it to pick up popcorn and small dirt chunks daily in a golf Pro-Shop. It couldn't handle it. It clogged and lost suction. The popcorn and ""stuff"" got stuck in the neck."
4,POWERFUL- HARD TO CLEAN,"This is powerful for a cordless vacuum and light. It's hard to keep clean, the filter casing gets filthy everytime you use it. I bought extra filters, but it's the casing that gets clogged- and it's nasty to clean. I wish I had extras of those."
1,Garbage - A waste of money,"Despite repeated cleaning and even removal of filters, this vacuum lacked the suction to pick up all but the finest dust after only 1 month. We threw it out."
3,Buyer Beware: No Longer Creapure,"If you look this product up online, you will find a lot of praise for it because it used to have the Creapure seal of quality. You can still see the small Creapure logo up on the top right of Amazon's product thumbnail (the orange label is the old one; the label is now blue). Lesser quality creatine often contains toxic impurities due to incomplete synthesis. I bought this brand regularly because that logo meant it was chemically analyzed and guaranteed to be free of such impurities. I received a new shipment yesterday with fancy new label art, but the product no longer carries the Creapure logo. Be aware of this fact before you purchase this creatine. I returned mine because it was not what I expected."
5,NOT BAD AT ALL,"I've been taking this for the past five weeks and have made noticeable gains. My recovery time is cut in half, and the sustained energy during workouts is also quite noticeable. I'm benching with 255lbs x 6instead of the normal 225lb x 6. Dumbell curl with 60 lbs instad of the usual 45 lbs. Arms are stretching the tape at 17 1/2 inches, before they were a tad under 17. I have to say, this product is working well for me so far. However, during the loading phoase, I cramped a little bit, but my water intake wasn't as high as it probably should have been. Also, I take only one serving a day instead of the recommended two. By taking only one serving daily, I find that I need less water to stay hydrated, and still manage to make new gains in size and strength."
3,stronger,Im 49 and I was hoping to get more out of this creatine than I got? I think I ended up taking 3 of these bottles while eating healthy over last summer... I dont think I got any bigger but I did get stronger.... I went from being able to do 80 pushups to being able to do 115 in one set.... I went from being able to do 125 pullups in 5 sets... to getting those 125 in 3 sets..... after I stop taking creatine those numbers dropped as well... I dont think I would take again.... I wanted to get leaner & bigger..... It didnt happen....
2,Extremely disappointing,"This sounded like a cool book idea, and I love cabins and log homes, so I ordered it. The photos are very disappointing. The homes are not the quality I expected. The book has a very regional, western look to it, which is a shame considering the fact that interesting and varied log homes can be found from coast to coast. They should have called this WESTERN LOG HOMES."
3,"NOT ""whisper quiet""","An oscillation tower fan that I had in my bedroom died, so I came to Amazon for the replacement. The Honeywell fan is advertised as ""whisper"" quiet, and several reveiws of the fan made mention of the fans quiet output. BUT, this fan is too noisy to use while sleeping. Otherwise, this is one powerful little fan. It takes up no space, the output is amazingly powerful, but it is NOT quiet. On the lowest setting, one can easily listen to the television, but the higher speeds, while not uncomfortably loud, are loud enough to require higher volumes than I like to use in my bedroom, in regards to watching TV. I will probably get another tower fan, which was incredibly quiet, but didn't last very long. Still, I can highly recommend this fan. It is efficient, and portable, and attractive (for a fan) and really moves the air around for a pretty good price. As always, I can highly recommend Amazon.com!"
