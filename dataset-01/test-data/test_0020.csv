2,Only one good thing about this movie. . .,"Michael Cerveris, who plays the guy Leroy makes googley eyes at in the diner. Just watch the deleted scenes!! I'd watch him over Brad Pitt any day."
1,Chased Away,"This cd could chase a music fan away from ever buying another cd from Amazon. It's that bad. Garth - please just hold your guitar and don't play it. You know, like you usually do."
1,Horrible service from Knife Depot,"I ordered these glasses as a Christmas gift and chose expedited shipping to be sure they would arrive in time. It is now January 4, and still no glasses. I sent seven emails to Knife Depot, left two phone messages, and in return got one email message from customer service stating that they had no information available. I began requesting for the order to be cancelled and even that took several days for Knife Depot to accomplish. I still have not been given an explanation for why the item was never shipped or why the company failed on every level to answer my inquiries. Because Knife Depot cancelled the order themselves, I was unable to leave Seller Feedback. I'd encourage shoppers to find this item, or a similar one, from another company."
4,Damn Yankees,"i remeber, seeing this movie baasically, when it was first released. and as I have a large collection of musicals, I wanted to add it to my collection, as i had not seen it available in Australia. After viewing Damn Yankees after 40 50 years, was very enjoyable, Gwen Verdon great, and Tab Hunter, yes!"
3,"""I'm irresistabull!!! you fool...give in.""","This movie does not have great storyline. It actually reminded me of a movie in the 80's called ""Oh god, You devil!"" But the best part of the movie is the production numbers. Check ""Whatever Lola wants"", ""Who's got the pain?"" and ""Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo. If you loved Bob Fosse , you'll definitely loved the chreography. Gwen Verdon is a diva to be adored in this movie."" If you wanted to see the broadway revue,""Fosse"" and you cannot go to NYC. See movies chreographed by Fosse like Pajama Game (""Steam Heat""), Cabaret (""Mein Herr""), All That Jazz (""Take off with us"") and Sweet Charity (""Big Spender"" and ""Rich Man Frug"") and definitely you see half of the show!!!!"
3,Mediocre Musical Saved by Star Power,"Damn Yankees is a peculiar, dated musical which probably was a lot better on stage than in movie version, however there are some cute numbers and engaging performances by wily Ray Walston and a strapping, earnest Tab Hunter.The real star of the show (check out the Trailer and you'll see how heavily reliant the studio was on her!) is Gwen Verdon and the choreography of her partner, Bob Fosse. Gwen's breathtaking in every moment she has...and this one is worth having in yoru collection if only for having her incredible talent preserved on film in your library! It's too bad more of her magic moments were captured onscreen for posterity. She was truly one in a million!"
4,Fratenity,This book gives you a good veiw into what fratenity life is like. You learn about the undreground of fraternity life.
4,Good but not his best,"Lumenagerie is a showcase of various drawings but Michael Manning. He has sections on avian dominatix's, a tranditional female domme, canine submissives, strap one service, maids/sissy maids, ponies and finally a variety of bestial beings engaging in sex.Michael Manning is famous for high quality, imaginative erotic illustrations with BDSM and pansexual themes. This particular book is a catalog of various themes that repeat themselves in his other novellas. Interesting if you already like Manning. Otherwise, start with Tranceptor (mainly hetero stuff) or Spider Garden (more pan sexual - i.e. if you are homophobic it might bother you)."
2,shredder,paper load slot to narrow. can not get paper in easily. shut itself off unexpectedly and you have to wait 15 min to restart.
2,paper shredder - bad item,"This shredder is cheap in cost and cheap in construction. Barely shreds 2-3 sheets at a time, sounds like a motorcycle (loud), and only one sidewill extend on a larger waste basket, which leaves the shredder off-center.All-in-all, I guess you get what you pay for, this thing is just barely a shredder.I would return it but it would cost more than the thing is worth!"
1,poor,The shredder did not even work. I was very disappointed and I already threw away the box and all and I was so fustrated I didn';t even try to send it back. I just didn't want to fool with it.
2,"For un upgraded version, try ""Dark Torment"". Skip this one.","Karen Robards is one of my favorites. Her more recent book, ""Dark Torment"", is extremely similar to ""Nobody's Angel"", and surpasses it in character development, plot and tension.""Dark Torment"" is the much better version, and I recommend you skip ""Nobody's Angel"" and go to the real thing.Suzannah's and Ian's relationship seemed slow, and there wasn't much tension (until the end on the ship).There was continuous reference to Suzannah's religious beliefs, but she fell into bed with Ian with almost no urging. Not too believable and overly hypocritical.I feel the end was also anti-climactic, and felt that Robards had included too many unnecessary secondary characters. They just got in the way.My advice read ""Dark Torment""."
5,"Please Mucka, don't hurt 'em!","Shmonkey: I like this cd, and I am not just saying that because I used to live with one of these guys.Clowny: Now you're bragging.S: Yeah, well, you dated him!C:I also enjoy that Atari song. Do they mention Centipede in it?S: I don't know, but the Lunch Rap is so choice. It highlights the voracious appetite of the band member we spoke of earlier (hello!).C: You're using big words again, Shmonkey.S & C (in unison): Muckafurgason's new CD gets five stars because our asses (Shmonkey's new favorite word) will be so grass if we say anything to the contrary. It rocks and it rolls. It swings like khakis. It is truly badical. Please Mucka, don't hurt 'em!"
1,former fan,"As a former Garth fan, I must admit that he really isn't that good. Likely a fad that I will look back on and laugh. Garth had a good roll, but this cd and really all his others too are quite poor musically."
1,Good firestarter,"This book was the most judgemental source of crap I've ever read. Does the author even have children? Rather than providing the pro's and con's to situations, she bashes every aspect of them. Anything that is not her opinion is bad, evil, and wrong. Her biased book has so much non-related informaiton that isn't even helpful. She brings up statistics that aren't even relevant to half of the women reading this book. The only thing it is good for is providing kindling for the fireplace."
1,"Negative, one-sided, unforgiving","Noble provides a wealth of information about good nutrition, birthing practices, and the risks of multiple pregnancy. The problem is that the factual evidence is smothered in a heavy handed, one-sided viewpoint that seems to originate from the fascist regime of down-with-all-modern-medicine. This is my second pregnancy, and I recently found out that I'm carrying twins. I was interested in the possibility of a vagnial birth with minimal intervention, but I'm more shaken than encouraged by Noble's stance on the evils of c-sections and other possible complications. This book was NOT the one I needed to help me discern what was best in the upcoming months.The nutrition information had a solid core, but Noble pushed the envelope with her own agenda of anti-dairy pro-vegan diets. This would have been much better received and better understood had it less of a screaming banshee tone.Good luck, and you might want to find a different book."
1,Not worth buying,"I'm glad I checked this book out from a local library rather than buying it. It is very one-sided. The author has a negative view on today's medical community. The choices, as well as the pros and cons are not clearly addressed, but rather the ""right"" or ""only"" way to do things. A couple expecting twins/multiples doesn't need absolute advice, but good information on which to make their own decisions."
1,What a waste of money!,"I cried through the first three chapters of this book. Then my husband made me stop reading it. It was so negative--not at all what I needed after the overwhelming news that we're expecting twins. I WOULD NOT recommend this book to any expectant mother, and would take it back if I thought they'd let me!"
2,not as awesome as I'd hoped,"parts of this book are ok, but I disagreed with a lot of it too- the book does not give an objective viewpoint on pregnancy & birth."
2,ridiculous book,"I pretty much agree with all the other negative reviews about this book so I won't restate everything, but this book was clearly written by someone who does not want to INFORM, but only to convince the reader to do things HER WAY. Basically, if you have a C-section, don't breast feed, or if you circumsize your child then you are a horrible person, according to the author. Also, I work in the Pediatric ICU and I can tell you that some things written in this book are not only false but could be dangerous to your child."
1,Having Twins and More,"There are several areas within this book which misrepresents published data - a concerning example of misinforming the public concerning areas in obstetrics which the authors obviously lack knowledge. The chapter on Prenatal Care and Screening Tests has inaccuate data on ultrasound and makes ultrasound seem unsafe. In fact, the reasons patients were having ultrasound exams in the first place were because they were having complications. The authors twist the data to make it sound as though the ultrasound caused the problems. Ultrasound equipment utilized in the USA has strict safety criteria to ensure safe use in fetuses. Too bad they forgot to describe how much perinatal care has advanced because of sonography.My patients find this book confuses them and misleading."
1,Borrow it from the library if you have to...,I would strongly suggest that you do not buy this book until you have had a chance to borrow it from the library and skim through it. I would say that more than 90% of soon-to-be parents out there will agree with all the negative reviews and would say it was a waste of money.
1,Having Twins and More: A Parents Guide to Multiple Pregnancy,I would not recommend purchasing this book for yourself or as a gift. If you want to know about everything that can go wrong with a multiple pregnancy than this book is for you. The book is very depressing and will add stress to any pregnant mother of multiples. There must be better books out there with information for pregnant women of multiples.
5,Used CD,"Immaculate condition, like it had never been out of the case before. Great buy, thank you for such great product supply."
5,This could be a greatest hits album by itself,"With ten songs, this album includes favorites such as What's She Doing Now, The River, and Papa Loved Mama. Other lesser known tracks like In Lonesome Dove and Burning Bridges are classic Garth Brooks. This is a cd that you can listen to straight through without forwarding past a song. You absolutely get your money's worth."
1,Baaad dvd transfer!!!,I thought this movie was pretty good.Vincent Price was great as usual and Agnes Moorehead gave a good performance as well.The reason I gave this movie 1 star is that the dvd transfer is bad.It's so bad that you can hardly enjoy the movie because your attention is on the bad picture quality of this dvd.I do not recommend this dvd.I just ordered another copy of this movie from amazon.It's from a different distributer(Anchor Bay Entertainment).It's more expensive but I figured I'd give it a shot.
5,The Bat,"This movie somehow is underrated. While not a fantastic thriller, it surely meets the requirement of a murder mystery with some very suspicious characters. I was surprised at the end to find out who the killer was. This features Agnes Moorehead, who is excellent, and Vincent Price..also you'll see ""Darla"" from the Little Rascals.If you want a good movie to watch with intrigue and mystery without it being terrifying this old time movie is the one to watch.Our family loves this movie, which is why we have just ordered it on DVD. We have it on VHS and would like to keep this in our library of DVDs."
4,God Bless the USA,"Back when this recording came out, and was only available on cassette,I helped a young man find it for a class that he was taking, and he told me he'd love me forever. I wish I could give a copy of it either on CD or cassette to everyone who has beeninvolved or has lost family and friends in the recent events. Itpretty well sums up the way that I feel. I am trying to get more copies for my library,and will get a new one for myself. I wouldrecommend it to anyone who wants to feel uplifted at this time,and hope that it continues to instill the spirit of this country especially at this crucial time. God Bless America!"
3,Music used for a slideshow of Yellowstone!,It gave me what I needed to put together a slide show of pictures...Plenty of song choices to choose from.
5,A song that changed my life,"on August 30 1997, on top of a mountain in Camp Pendleton, California affectionately known as the ""Grim Reaper,"" my life changed forever. I had just completed 56 hours of a grueling baptism of fire known as ""The Crucible."" Atop that hill I became a United States Marine. I received a small, black Eagle Globe and Anchor (the insignia of the Marine Corps) to the tune of ""God Bless the USA."" To this day, after over 6 years in the Marine Corps, the sound of that song still brings a tear to my eye, and I would reccomend this song and this album to everyone, young and old, even if you're not a Marine or even somewhat patriotic."
5,Lee Greenwood,Excellent group of Patriotic songs for any occasion including the Pledge of Allegiance both recited and sung which is quite unusual and very well done!
4,another perspective into the lives of giants in life,"This book provided a quick reading and interesting perspective into the lives of men we all grew up knowing as corporate ""giants""; perhaps the first American corporate giants.Not a drama; just a well supported story of how these two men made more money than can be imagined on the backs of working men at the turn of the century.I found it a worthwhile read, and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history, giants in America, or anyone that simply wants to know a little more than our normal history books offer about these men."
1,Garbage,"Cinematography that looks like it was shot by a 5 year old, terrible audio and a message that basically says there's no God. How did this turn into an athiest documentary about star wars fans. The worst video I've seen all year."
1,Sucks,"Rubalcava and Lovano might be great on their own but together they suck, at least on this cd. Like oil and water, they do not mix well. This was a major disappointment, so much so that I got rid of it. I do admit that I did hear potential for some major jams so I am willing to buy another one of his cd's and try it, since I believe there is a monster in there but not in this one. I like Chucho Valdes, Hilton Ruiz, Ruben Gonzalez, Papo Luca, Palmieri, etc. and I thought this would be more along those lines. Mr. Rubalcava should stick to his genre. For full blown jazz I'll listen to Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson. For dissonant jazz I listen to nobody, I don't care how good the performer is supposed to be. Dissonant music, isn't that an oxymoron. We 'll try once more."
2,A compilation to avoid.,"This compilation does no justice to Isaac Hayes, his artistry or his visionary genius. Why? Isaac was an artist whose music needed to be heard (or, more accurately, EXPERIENCED) on a full-length basis to be appreciated. While most of these songs were (out of necessity) released as singles it goes without saying that the full-length LP versions of such immortal Hayes classics as ""Walk On By"", ""I Stand Accused"", ""The Look Of Love"", ""Joy"" and ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" were what sold their respective parent albums. If you really want a compilation of Isaac's hits then I recommend getting the now-deleted ""Best of Isaac Hayes "" Volumes 1 & 2 (both released in 1986) as these at least give you the original album versions without any (unnecessary) editing."
3,Challenging in Many Ways,"Bought this for a friend who loves Sudoku. The games are challenging enough and the play is OK, she says. HOWEVER - it's not backlit so you can't play it in less than full lighting and the sensitivity with the stylus is a bit loose."
4,Great for natural hair,I use it to seal the ends of my hair after every wash. It helps the keep my hair soft as well.
2,Boredoms Boring?,"I'm sorry, but the Boredoms doing Psychedelic doesn't seem right to me. I was expecting somewhat more avant-guarde noise, so I had to check the disk to make sure that they didn't insert a Kraftwork CD in the case by mistake. At least I still have The Ruins and Yoshida Tatsuya's other side projects. I was disapointed, but if you are abit afraid of the more avante-guarde material, you might find this enjoyable, especially as background music."
3,Average,"The book arrived a couple of weeks before I expected it, so that was great and I am very happy with the delivery process.But I am not so happy with the book. It is not bad, but I think that there is too little concept art. I mean, in the race concept art, you find a lot of 3D images of the game and that's not concept, that's result, and I think they could have put more sketches or illustrations. The whole layup is a bit messy.I bought this book beacause I am a big fan of wacraft and world of warcraft, and I expected as concept art book, something like the Starcraft 2 artbook. I imagine that this difference between layup quality is simply because they got better at doing them. That is the price of practice.Anyway this book is a must have for all fans."
1,blames the victim,I think these ideas might work with people you have limited contact with.The scenario about the husband blowing up about the dinner was just terrible and I really couldn't see how this guy really loves his wife. He just expects her to be obedient like some dog.Elgin says if you just respond the right way you can stop the verbal abuse. This just isn't true. Most verbal abusers are just looking to find fault about anything.The problem lies with the abuser and not the victim. The abuser needs to learn how to stop treating people that way.Most victims of abuse spend years twisting and contorting themselves to try to fix what they are doing wrong so the abuse will stop.Notice the in the scenarios the abuse never stopped. Just until next time when the husband felt like blowing up about something again.
5,Practical advice,"Found this book to be full of constructive, tangible ways to change the way I communicate. Provided many examples and scenarios that applied-- and which I see around me. Immediately able to put it to work."
3,Son won't watch it :(,"My son is annoyed by this DVD :( he won't even watch it. Got him to watch it once, but no luck :(he LOVES Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera though.I must say, my intent for purchasing these is to help reinforce the Spanish I speak to him, since my husband doesn't speak it."
5,Great for spanish speaking children or children who have not yet begun to speak,"My child is 8 months old in a bilingual home. This video is perfect for those who know at least a little spanish. If you are a parent, trying to teach your child spanish; this is not for you. Your child, before the age of one, can learn virtually any language you throw at them. stay persistent and keep speaking spanish, even if you dont know alot of it, learn commands, colors, and numbers etc for your child. This video will capture their curiousity and they will pay attention. Great songs as always :)"
4,hidden treasure,"After finding a magazine article profiling Mance Lipscomb, I set out in search of one of his recordings, and found Captain, Captain. At first I was transported back in time to the early 30's in the heart of the Miss. delta region. The cuts, are poorly mastered resulting in poorer reproduction, but the result is a deeply soulful feeling. One filled with the pain and strife of a local cotton sharecropper. I think Mance's influence has traversed geographical borders, and can be heard in the 1970's Isreali folk albums recorded by Adam Rosenblum. Some of his work dealing with Kibutz life, and the olive harvest is reminsient of the american delta blues singers. In short from the standpoint of blues scholar or blues fan, Captain Captian completes a void in most collections."
1,SHUTUP!!!!!!!,"i mean one star is too much. garth brooks reiks. why wasnt he a victim of the texas chainsaw massacre, lol?!?!? try out some Zombie, some real good music"
3,Wrong Way Feelin?!?!?!,"Heaven Help The Fool is my personal favorite Bobby solo album (you can't really count Ace). It's so self-referentially 70s poseur, but so musically wonderful in Weir's idiosyncratic way, that it's a classic. Except for Wrong Way Feelin--while the words are hilarious, it's easily the most awkward and lamest tune on the album. Which makes the absence of Heaven Help the Fool and Bombs Away, that much more painful and inexplicable. I mean, I'm sure Weir finds it a little embarrassing, perhaps to self-analytical, but, hell, if he can be play the role of the ""Estimated Prophet,"" then why can't he be the Fool?"
1,under rated,"This product rarely works unless you get the seed packs and immediately plant them...Very expensive, and maybe 50% of the time,you may or may not get anything to grow. I've had this for 3 years now and rarely had but a few things grow...Much easier to go to the garden shop and buy the plants and put them in your garden.I've had tons of their kits sent to me, and only half of them seem to work...I'll call customer service, and yes they will send more....but by then, the 3 that worked are growing big and you cannot start the new ones.Sorry to say, this product is for ""rich people"" who have the time time play. I'm only wanting to plant foods to eat and survive."
3,"One lemon, one working","Well, I have two - one at work and one at my father's. The one at work is in my cube and not a day goes by when people don;t comment on how well the (herbs, peppers, salad) are going. No trouble with bugs on the aerogarden, had some on other plants in the office taken care of with bug spray. When I thinned out the peppers I planted the excess in pots - while I am harvesting peppers now from the aerogarden, the pepper plants in pots are only a couple of inches high and a long way away from harvest.However - the one at my father's died during the second planting.Built my own for *much* less - Pump $10, Hoses $2, hydroponic media $3, nutrients $20 (but enough for many cycles), base was a used aquarium, and I custom cut a top for it. Lighting provided by a couple of all spectrum flourscents @$6 each with a longer life than the ones provided by Aerogarden in a $10 shop light kit lined with foil. Doesn't look as nice but works just as well and you can watch the roots."
2,Make Your Own !!,"I bought two of these directly from AeroGardens. One with the salad greens and one with the tomatoes. I've had them for 32 days now, and the greens are about 2"" tall and the tomatoes show one tomato plant that is no more than 1/4"" high. I called to do an RMA. I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail. I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels. I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment. I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied. These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger. To the company's credit, they are paying for the return shipping so I am only out the initial shipping (about $30)."
2,5 months of nothing,I purchased the 3 pod and bought the salsa garden and after 5 months of care and followed all instructions only two very small tomatoes and one very small jI purchased the 3 pod and bought the salsa garden and after 5 months of care and followed all instructions only two very small tomatoes and one very small jelapino grew and after 5 months I was really Hungary after waiting ... I gave up and now planted the basil and wow it's growing nice . I would not buy the salsa garden pod but I will buy herbs only . elapino grew. I gave up and now planted the basil and wow it's growing nice . I would not buy the salsa garden pod but I will buy herbs only .
1,$100 bowl of salad,"No plural there. One bowl. We used this for 3 months and it's been collecting dust in the attic ever since. I can see this being an interesting novelty gift for city folk, but that's it. Truly disappointed."
1,Electricity drainer.,"Got this for Christmas last year. It drains electricity like crazy - my bill was almost doubled! In addition, the lights are on in the middle of the night and are nearly blinding. Not worth it for herbs you can easily grow outside in pots."
4,Works for me!,"FAST GROWTH! I've never seen plants ""take off"" so fast!I love having fresh herbs in winter! Now that the summer is approaching, I'll probably transplant them to a window box in a couple of weeks. And start my flowers in the Aerogardem, and then transplant them outside.I would have given the product 5 stars except for the pump cleaning process that's necessary. I don't really mind it too much, but; not everyone is mechanical. I'm sure lots of people aren't going to be comfortable taking apart the Aerogarden's pump. Also, you should clean between the growth deck and the pump. YouTube has a video on how to do it properly [...]Residue tends to collect in that tight space and inhibit water flow."
2,May be bad seeds,"I bought this unit on special from Amazon. I have followed the instructions to the letter and after 7 weeks, the only thing that can be harvested is the chives. Dill is doing ok, but looks nothing like the pictures. Basils, mint, parsley and thyme have barely past the sprouting point. I will try one more kit and if this doesn't work it is going in the next yard sale."
5,Bio-Dome,AeroGrow AeroGarden Indoor Gardening Kit with Gourmet Herbs BlackGreat for anyone with little space.
2,hell's ditch,More than hell it was twilight zone ! Pogues at their lowest with a bunch of irish-oriental-like style songs with Shane booking for a desert island one way trip. Few sparkles of old genius (Lorca's novena and hell's ditch) are not enough to deserve a buy reccomandation. For Pogues fans only
2,The Beginning of the End,"The writing was on the wall by the time Peace and Love was released, but Hells Ditch, The Pogues' fifth album, signalled the end of an era. By this album there was little left of the raw vocal and musical energy and Celtic flair that made The Pogues so famous. Instead this album awkwardly explores a wide range of musical styles, and frontman Shane MacGowan sounds so bored and drunk that the music has to carry him through the entire album. In fact he was so distant from the band by this time--largely because of his drinking habit--that he only sang about half the songs on the album. (Not surprisingly, this is the last Pogues album with MacGowan as a band member.) The magic was clearly gone by this time, and they never got it back. Overall this is a decent album, but is a profound letdown by Pogues standards--hence the 2-star rating."
5,Fascinating glimpse into the depths,"Titanic had two, almost identical, sister ships. The Olympic sailed on into the mid 1930's and was scrapped, but the Britannic was sunk in the Aegean Sea during the first world war when she was acting as a hospital ship. Can Robert Ballard find the wreck, and solve the mysteries of how the ship met her doom and why she sank so quickly?This video is fairly typical of its genre, covering as it does the history of the ship, the search and discovery and trying to draw conclusions. Overtaken by recent research, the findings are nonetheless interesting and the visuals are superb. A haunting story well told"
5,Ahab's Wife,"I have purchased all 3 books from the Ahab Series and read them immediately. Had a hard time putting them down. i am passing them on to a friend as she is also a christian and enjoys these books.Also purchased ""A Home Coming"" by the same author but haven't read it yet. will preview it later."
4,Second in a gripping trilogy . . .,"HANNAH ROSEIn Hannah Rose, the sequel to Ahab's Bride, Louise Gouge re-creates the world of pre-Civil War Boston. Widowed Hannah Ahab, under the family name of Jacobs, seeks peace and protection for herself and her small son, Timothy, from the rumors of dead Captain Ahab's madness and evil. There she faces a choice between helping run away slaves or living a life of self-centered elegance. This choice is reflected by two men in her life. She becomes reacquainted with selfless, kind-hearted Captain Lazarus and introduced to the attentions of handsome, swashbuckling Captain Dashwood. Though Hannah Rose begins at a slightly slower pace than Ahab's Bride, it nevertheless delivers romance, intrigue and a fascinating historical picture of pre-Civil War Boston."
4,Great for Camping,I got this for camping because I was tired of using expensive throw away tanks that didn't hold much gas.This one is a great compact size and costs about [...] to fill up. It is more than 4 times the capacity of the smaller ones yet still costs less to fill up then to buy one of the smaller ones.The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price (although it will eventually pay for itself). Also sucks that Coleman makes you buy another [...] attachment to attach to their stoves.
2,There are much better yoga workouts out there!,"Though not a bad workout for beginners, I expected much more from a routine touted as 'fat-burning.' The moves are very basic, and there's very little flow - the whole quiet peacefulness of yoga (which is it's real power) is lost in the too-quick movements. It seems as if what the instructor lacks in difficulty she tries to make up in speed.And let's talk about the instructor, shall we? She seems knowledgeable, but her weird vocal lilt and incessant giggling is just downright irritating. Her instructions are relatively good, but the moves are so basic that shouldn't be too difficult. I'd recommend the Buns of Steel Power Yoga if you're looking for a good yoga workout, or any from the Bryan Kest series."
5,Relax and enjoy,"I recently purchased this yoga tape and thoroughly enjoy it. It is not a high energy workout, but it really works to strengthen your arms and legs. I feel ""balanced"" after I complete this workout. It can be accompanied by a higher impact workout for those of you who need more then just yoga in a day. I thought this was an excellent video. The instructor is down to earth and not overpowering. She explains things well, and you don't feel like you have to ""overachieve"" during the video. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good yoga workout."
5,Wow. Love it.,"I really like the routine, the instructor, and the overall everything about this video. The instructor is really likable and the routine is nice and varied and goes at a good pace (Not a lot of pausing to talk which is good). I work out a lot but am pretty new to yoga. She gives good instructions for beginners. I found this quite challenging but was able to do it all the way through with the modifications she shows for beginners. My legs and arms are definately working hard. And my whole body feels so good after I do this video (especially my back), energized, rejuvinated, and stronger. Love it. Highly recommended!"
1,Waste of Money,"This video was a waste of money. The title, Fat Burning Yoga,was misleading. I thought that i would get my heart rate up, but no that didn't happen. Fine, if you've never done yoga before, you might get some benefit out of this video. But, if you've previously done yoga at all, this video is junk. I'd definitely recommend Rodney Yee's videos. They are easy to follow and enjoyable."
1,"no fat burn for me, couldn't get my heart rate up with this","the title is misleading, there is no way i could get my heart rate up with this video to burn fat, no way...i'd rather do a Leisa Hart MBC Yoga video to stretch and tone than to do this."
2,Great Yoga Tape? I do not think so!,"I think there are two major problems with this tape. First, in no way it is suitable for beginners. Instructor cues for breathing are inconsistent, about 50% of the time there is no cueing at all. Her cues for poses are very poor, she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not. You cannot follow her without looking at your TV screen, and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch, 50% of the time she is not going to tell you. The program does contain two levels, for more and less flexible. Yet, transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance. Try Jane Fonda Yoga instead, or (and) Kundahlini yoga."
2,Ouch!,I thought this would be doable since it is for burning fat. I am trying to lose weight but couldn't even get through the tape because my body didn't bend the way hers(a skinny person) did. Their is no reason to have a size 2 woman teaching difficult yoga positions to fat people.
2,for beginners!,"i've been doing power yoga for about 5 months now and i thought this video who do as it says..fat burn! however, the yoga routine seemed very slow paced and a little bit lame. i recommend this video to those who are just starting yoga, but otherwise try the bryan kest videos!"
2,No Passion For This Topic,"After 'There Are No Children Here', I was eager to ready anything and everything that Kotlowitz was writting. This book was a major disappointment. Clearly the author lacked the passion for this story that he had in his previous book. I'm not sure that this topic holds up as an accurate microcosm for race relations in middle America as it attempts to do so it's difficult to see why this would be an important text to anyone who didn't live in southwest Michigan. Nonetheless, it is well written."
3,(PLAN 452) Book Review,"Alex Kotlowitz wrote a good book that is both easy to read and worth reading. He does a good job at telling the story of the two towns and the towns' residents to a backdrop of a local murder case that tested the towns' race realations. Lots of local history is told in this book. This allows the reader to get closer to understanding the towns. Being from a nearby city myself, I had heard of such conflict it was interesting to read more about the two communities involved (Benton Harbor and St. Joe, Michigan). If your from the area, then this book is definatly woth reading to in terms of getting an outsiders fairly unbiased view of the area. If not, its still worth checking out because its just interesting story to read and may lead to some self-reflection."
5,I loved this story!,"Kate & Zach's story is so touching, loving and involved. Kate is a mother who loves her daughter more than life itself. Her daughter, Miranda, will capture your heart. Zach is a strong hard man with a heart of gold. Anderson does her best work here since Keegan's Lady!"
1,Mick Harte Was Here.,"This book is about a 12-year-old boy who tries to be different from other kids. For Halloween, he was Thomas Crapper, the man who invented the modern day toilet. Mick Harte always wanted to be the best at everything. He refused to wear his helmet when he rode his bike,but he could have lived if he would have worn his helmet.I really didn't care for this book. It could have been longer. I didn't like this book because it wasn't very inventful and not a very fun book to read."
1,I wish this book was dead instead,"Mick Harte Was Here was kind of boring, but it had a few exciting parts in it. For example, when Phoebe and Mick wrote the word FART in the driveway, that was pretty funny. However, some people might find it kind of sad because Mick Harte was one of the main characters in the story, and he dies a horrible death. He dies because he was supposed to go to one of his friend's house, and he had a terrible accident.Mick asks Phoebe to ride his bike home for him, but she said, ""No."" Then Mick asked Phoebe's friend Zoe if she would do the favor, but she said, ""No."" Thus, Mick had no choice but to ride his bike to his friend's house. When Mick started riding his bike, he went head on into a truck which gave him really bad head damage.I myself wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because this book isn't too exiting. Unless you like the sad and actually kind of boring books, I wouldn't read this novel."
5,"A sad but awesome, educational book.",This book made me realize the dangers of not wearing a bicycle helmet. After I read this book I started to after never wearing one. Mick Harte Was Here is on my top five list of my favorite books. Everyone should read it because it has educational value and you will get a ton of laughs at the many funny things Mick had done in his life.
5,A 13-year-old girl's story of a very special brother.,"After Mick is killed in a bicycle accident, his 13-year-old sister, Phoebe, tells of the special relationship they shared. This is a very sad book, but also one of the funniest I've read. I first read it to a class of 6th-graders during library time, and it has become a tradition in the elementary school where I am librarian. A bit heavy-handed in places, Mick Harte Was Here is still a great read!"
5,The Wealthy Writer,"This is without doubt the most practical freelance writing book that I have ever read. Mr. Meanwell doesn't try to hook the reader with generic tips that have no ""real-world"" applications; instead, his book is full of specific ideas about how to branch out from the usual freelance jobs into the more unusual, but yet very needed, markets of today that are not as obvious. One thing that I particularly like about ""The Wealthy Writer"" is that each chapter not only explains the process for getting the deal, but it also elaborates on how to truly satisfy the customer by going beyond the ordinary. Mr. Meanwell provides unambiguous case studies with actual examples of his own work and explanations of how he succeeded in each example. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in starting (or maintaining) a freelance business. Mr. Meanwell has inspired me with this wonderful book, and I plan to refer to it often."
5,Bratz STINK!,What's wrong with you Bratz fans?! My Scene blows Bratz away!!! Here are some reasons why.1.Bratz are VERY ugly!2.They have big lips!3.There BORING!!!!4.Thev'e also got Bug eyes!I don't want to be mean though.
1,BRATZ ARE KEEPIN IT REAL!,If I could rate these dolls lower then I would put this -1. Im not hatin on My scene but what the hell. My scene looks so cheap. They must be taking these dolls out of the garbage and then selling them. Bratz is way beyond all of the other dolls because they know how to strut there stuff and they aint afraid to show there fashion. Stop looking in the garbage for a my scene dolll and get a Bratz doll from toysrus. Love you bratz fans out there. If you want to keep it real then buy a bratz doll.
3,Hmmm........,"I love myscene but do not like this line. They have real eyelashes and tiny eyes. The only good part is the clothes that they were. MATTEL, you should make a fashion pack out of their clothes"
1,Ewwwwwwww!!!,"A sexy outfit?Please.If thats the way we want little girls to act count me out.I can't even belive it wasn't kicked out allready.Barbie's outfits are terribly tacky.And her face has that spoiled princess look to it.And soon every girl who has it will practicly be saying ""I want to be a belly dancer.""I do NOT recamend that doll."
2,Not what I expected...,"When we found out that we were expecting twins, a friend with twins recommended this book to us. We found that the book was not very realistic for the every day person. Although the author's story was intersting to read about, we didn't find it at all helpful in preparing for our twins. For a more realistic look at life with twins, I would highly recommend 'Ready or not, here we come' by Elizabeth Lyons."
2,"Great book, but it was missing the last 35 pages... :(",The book was great but the retailer who shipped it to me failed to check if all the pages were there. Talk about a cliff hanger!
5,Top Notch,"This is the second in the Travis McGee series, though it doesn't place itself chronologically -- ie, it doesn't refer to the events of the first book, and it does refer to other adventures, as if it's just another in McGee's long life. However, the next book in the series, ""A Purple Place for Dying,"" does take place right after this one, so there is an advantage to reading them in order.In ""Nightmare"" Travis goes to New York. If you can't deal with that, then this one's not for you, but otherwise it's a knockout. The suspense is great, the philosophizing feels amazingly current, and MacDonald clearly knows New York. The book is great mix of retro setting and modern-feeling plotting and characterization. If anything, it's smoother than ""The Deep Blue Good-By,"" since it doesn't need to introduce anything.The Travis McGee series is terrific. I'm still reading my way through it, but I haven't found any reason not to go in order. ""Nightmare in Pink"" is great."
5,"Doesnt get better than this, what a compilation, awesome","These days you never get a ""best of"" CD with 18 songs on it, its almost like a double album at the price of one, and it rocks. Every song is delightful, truly transports the listener to another realm. I absolutely LOVE their rendition of Cat Stevens' Wild World in a spanish guitar style setting. I saw the Wild World video on a local cable channel, really well done. Cannot wait for their next release----great job Higher Octave/Virgin!"
3,quirky and a little boring,"A rather quirky book, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I couldn't help analyzing which part Lori Copeland wrote and which part Angela Hunt wrote (I suspect all the afterlife/angel parts!) Edith's diet story got very old, and I found it funny that the dream about taking care of her body was obviously penned by the same author who wrote Dr. Jonah's lecture to Jacquelyn about eating a variety of all foods for her body in A Time to Mend. That said, ""The Heavenly Daze Series"" is a very appropriate series title - if you're after a light, fluffy read."
2,"Disappointed, unfortunately","I wanted to love this album but I just couldn't. I had heard a track or two on Pandora and thought this was going to be a really special jazz album. Unfortunately, I found it pretty ordinary and uninspiring. I still love that one track (You Leave Me Breathless); just wish I could have purchased the song by itself but iTunes doesn't have the album. They have other Eden Atwood albums, but not this one. Now I know why..."
5,Very subtle taste,I have been using this tea in making kombucha. The flavor is subtle and perfect for kombucha base!
5,A great collection,"as its name said the best of Savage Garden, if you like this artist and you can`t buy all their albums, buy this one, have all the greatest songs that I ever hear, definitive i recomend this album!"
3,not thrilled with the album,"My husband and I are huge Savage Garden fans. We were both disappointed with this album. It seems like towards the end of the CD they were just trying to fill in space. It is ashame because there were so many other wonderful songs they created that did not appear on the album. I would reccomend buying the original CD's separately, get more for your money that way."
2,"Nice In Theory, Not So Nice in Use","Out of all the Riedel glasses I have purchased or used, these are my least favorite. Unless you have extremely large hands, it is hard to get a secure grip on the Pinot tumblers, much less with hands greasy from a nice dish of chicken wings. I really don't see any advantage to these tumblers over traditional stemmed glasses. They are just as delicate and difficult to wash, and you will have to wash fingerprints off the tumblers (chicken wings or not), and they aren't really all that easier to store in the cabinet. If you want to reduce the risk of breaking a stem, I'd recommend purchasing one of the thicker-stemmed Riedel offerings before going for the tumblers."
3,Nice but hard to manage.,"I like these glasses, but they are a little to big around at the base for me to manage with my smaller hands."
4,Cozy glasses,"I own some of these glasses and have given others as gifts. I enjoy these for informal dinners and after dinner sipping. It is nice to not have the 'tippiness' factor of a stemmed glass involved when relaxing. I also have a 'special' place for these in my dishwasher. and so far, no accidents. Just be sure that they are on the top rack and not touching anything else. I may be a little too critical, however, because after only about 200 washings they loose a little of their luster. Imagine that!?! One of the nicest things about these glasses is the delicate thinness of the lip. It just makes sipping wine (or anything) more elegant."
5,Good for everday use.,"Let me first address the fragility issue. I've found that many items I've ordered from Amazon come lacking sufficient packing material, usually those little air ""pillows"". This was no exception. The shipping box was so crushed on one end that I took photos of it before I opened it. You not only could hear the inner box sliding around, but you could also hear the wine tumblers moving inside. In spite of the poor packing, the glasses were in perfect shape. I'm confident they will hold up during regular use.As for the glasses themselves, we already have a set of stemmed Riedel Merlot glasses, and these are the same quality, which I think is an excellent value for the money. We now use the tumblers for our everyday wine use, and will probably get a pair of the Chardonnay tumblers next."
3,Beautiful glasses..... but too big,"I love these glasses. I own nearly all of the various Vinum stems, and they are fabulous. I love the 'O' glasses too - great looking and functional. But I have small hands, and these Pinot glasses are just a little too big, and I've found myself nearly dropping them on a few occasions. They are back in the box, waiting for guests with bigger paws than mine!! In the meanime, for Cabs, Shiraz, Zins, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, etc I often use the 'O's."
1,These glasses are way too fragile.,These glasses were terribly disappointing. They are so thin and delicate that I am afraid to wash them. The base is so unsteady that you feel uncomfortable about setting them down. I have found the solution - do not use them - they suck.
5,Best yet,"This CD made me want to curl into a ball and die. It's perfect-- Except Aria. I don't see how that one fit here. The cd is sad, and that song is.. Something else. Not that it's bad, by no means is it.. But if i were to hear Delerium for the first time, i'd be so turned off by that song. The best song on here (in my opinion of course) is Innocente. That was the first hook from this CD that got me. Then Terra Firma started getting stuck in my head. Once i got past the Aria lump, which took awhile, i heard the rest of the cd. PERFECT is all i can say. High points include Fallen Ikons, and especially Underwater. Even the instrumentals are great. For first time listeners of Delerium, start here. If you're not into ambient that much, this will help you on your way. I'm a big fan of harder music, like taproot and factory 81, and this cd refuses to come out of my cd player. Great CD, get it NOW while they still have the limited edition in print.."
2,deterium,"I was anxious for this album as soon as I got Karma, however it wasn't worth the wait. It lacks focus and inspiration. It is lighter than the other Delerium albums but the greater use of the constant thumping dance beat reduces this album to something less enjoyable than even the remixes of Karma. Melodies are not as memorable, voices are less clear. Essentially it's Karma really watered down, tossed out to appeize the masses. I'll play Karma and Semantic Spaces for years but after the 3 week run in my car juke I doubt I'll actually pull this one out for any reason. I'd advise you hear this one first before you buy."
2,No Kristy Thirsk!!!,"Overall, the CD is ""OK"". Nothing special and compared to the prior releases it was shelved pretty quickly.Thirsk was to be on four tracks on this CD. She isn't anywhere to be found. Before I buy a Delirium CD in the future I'll make sure she's there.Don't expect classic tracks off of this one. I was pretty disappointed...."
4,Great cd,"Great cd. If your into Enigma you'll love this cd. Alot of this style music these days has become very wish washy, but Delerium does a great job of keeping it fresh."
2,Not nearly as challenging as I had hoped,"I bought this video because after reading all the reviews on this tape, I thought it would be challenging and give me a great workout. I was disappointed because it is mostly a low-impact weights workout and by the end of half an hour, I had barely broken a sweat. Afterwards, I popped in my ""The Method: Boot Camp"" tape to feel like I had really done something. I tend to think of myself at an intermediate level when it comes to exercising, and this particular tape doesn't cut it for me. My muscles didn't even ache the next day from the weights."
1,Do NOT buy this video if you want simple!!,"I am so upset right now. I just got this video today and TRIED to do it, but Miss Zaki changes up her moves way too fast for me. I hate wasting my money, especially since I did research trying to find a good cardio video I might like. If you're a professional dancer and have a lot of room to move, then buy it. If not, you know what to do now thanks to me. A good video that has simple moves and works out all of your body is Victoria Johnson's H.A.B.I.T. The video is made in the early 90's, but it's easy to follow and burns caleries."
2,Not what you might expect,I was very disappointed with this being my 6th Crunch video. The camera cuts away at key moments. It skips around from person to person during some of the steps so that it takes several views of the video to get some of the moves (which once learned are fairly easy) down.
3,OK,"Good workout for its kind. Not as good as Crunch Boot Camp, but I felt the burn from time to time. LOL! The buns workout at the end is good too. My main complaint were the weird balance moves that I found hard to do and not very effective."
3,Teanna Kai is the only thing good about this DVD,"On this dvd you will find the world most beautiful women filmed the way men want to see them... seductive, sultry and sensuous. Peach DVD puts you in total control. Welcome to the new age of Digital Erotica."
1,Give me a Break!!,"Larry Williams is not a trader, he is a promoter. Does Paul Tudor Jones sell ""how to trade"" courses? No, he is busy making money. Do any great traders sell courses or send mass mailings? Methinks not. This book like all Larry Williams books smack of ignorance about the reality of what works and does not work in the marketplace. I am a winning trader and I can assure you that 95% of what you read will not be worth your time. I am doubtful that this review will even be published but if it is I will be happy if just one person benefits from it."
5,"Great product, but buy it in the store!","I love Woodwick candles, but it really isn't a good idea to buy these online. The first candle I received came packaged very well. Lots of packing peanuts and newspapers, but it was still broken. I email the seller and they immediately sent me another. It was in the same condition. It looks like they just don't ship well."
5,Saucony sneaker,"My daughter loves these shoes! They have""cush"" and are comfortable for all day wear. She has had them several weeks and still look like new- would buy again."
1,Good for a moment,"This product I bought last August and after 5 months it worked well, but after this it had broken and the assistence is even worst. Too bad for the brand that has good items on their portfolio."
2,"Mine Broke Too (leaked, too)","Worked well for a spell. I understood it had a lifetime warranty. I have made 3 attemts to make a warranty claim. Try this: go to Gardena.com and find the warranty link. what I got was: ""The requested page was not found on this server. If you have typed in the address manually, please check if the syntax was correct."" Tax? did I SYN?Win some.... (when did you last win one?)"
2,Wimps have trouble with retirement,"I've been to two week-long workshops at the University of Iowa and found them extremely useful and well organized. Thus, I was disappointed in Klaus, who played an important role in the writing program at UI, because his book Taking Retirement leaves much to be desired. He is far too concerned about his own fear of retirement. If he had some suggestions for those who fear retirement, the book would be more helpful. I found it tedious, maybe because I've been retired for a while. Never did I read anyone's work who felt so sorry for himself. I wanted to tell Klaus to ""get a life"" as the younger generation says."
1,A Misleading Threat to Depressed Patients Everywhere,"Dr. Breggin never prescribes psychotropics. He therefore has no experience with any. Untreated depression has a hard outcome, suicide at the peak age of responsibility and productivity. He is less a Ralph Nader type, than a hate speech advocate against modern psychiatry. He is similar to advocates of the horse when cars were first being made. He should be advocating accuracy,pragmatism and focus on what works. Some depressed patients benefit from anti-depressants and even electro-convulsive therapy. Some do not, benefitting from other therapies. Matching is the key, not extremist, obstructionist, heinous dogma. The arrogance that he knows what is best for the patients better than they do is unbearable."
3,"It's good, not great","I heard great reviews about this, but it didn't help as much as I'd hoped. There is a lot to read, but not a lot of practical advice for the very early drawer. It is geared toward children as young as 4 but I don't think it helped my six year old that much."
4,art teacher,"I have a previously published book by Mona Brookes. I liked it very much, and purchased this issue to get a better insight in teaching pre school aged children. It was very helpful, while not providing specific lesson plans for my 26+ group( what would), it gave me simpler processes and approaches to help me out. I very much reccommend this book for anyone looking for ways to draw and teaching/seeingto many different age groups."
2,Revealing,"William Queen presents a straightforward and compelling look at life within the most violent outlaw motorcycle gang in the United States. I found the most disturbing thing to be the movement of the gang across the United States, establishing locations in areas where local police have no experience dealing with them. Seeing the gang from the inside is a revealing and eye-opening story."
2,Interesting but lacking any real substance,"After reading the reviews and dust jacket I was expecting a book with some interesting stories but every chapter left me wondering why I was wasting my time on this book. He risked his life and went undercover but what did he discover? a bunch of losers who fight each other and do crank. All of the BIG moments in the book came and went with out much detail, excitment or anything that would make me care. The supposed plotting to kill a LA county sheriff is a great example. Their was no plot, he just happend to drive by the mongols campground and one of the drunken bikers on parole says ""If he stops I'm going to take him out"". Not much of a story if you ask me. I will be sending this one to the used book store asap."
5,Captivating!,"This is one of those books you don't leave alone until you finish. I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. The author went under cover for two and one-half years, infiltrating the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang. Before becoming a ""full patch"" or full member, he had to endure being a ""prospect."" He ultimately is successful but is almost derailed by law enforcement bureaucrats along the way.The only part of the book I find hard to believe is that he was able to abstain from some of the rowdy or raunchy behavior. I would think an under cover operation would have to look the other way rather than risk being found out. Queen was in situations where he was asked to take drugs, fight, kill, rape and steal. He emphasizes that he got out of doing these things but I have my doubts. All told, though, a very exciting and interesting true crime story."
3,Good Read,"Bought this book on the recommendation of a co-worker when I mentioned I was researching outlaw motorcycle gangs. I give this guy credit for what he did, a tough assignment. Book is ok. Did give me some insight into the outlaw MC clubs."
5,Excellent book,"This book is both informative and entertaining. Queen really takes you into the world of the ""1%"" Motorcycle clubs."
5,highway to hell,"one of the best books i,ve ever read. keeps you glued to the book , that you wont leave it out of your hands... how this man was able to keep it together is unreal. .. But from reading other books , i don,t think the mongols were any more vicious than some other biker clubs. ................ excellent book"
3,Interesting.,"Interesting story. I sensed some of the gory details may have been sugar-coated to protect the author, but entertaining none the less."
5,Under and Alone,"I bought this book because receintly I met a Mongol member. I had no idea what that meant, so, I bought this book. The book really gave me the inside story of everyday life inside of this outlaw motorcycle gang.It is like watching a train wreck you know it is horribly wrong, but you can't look away. Or in this case stop reading."
3,So-So,"I had high hopes as driving at night is not fun for me anymore. However, I did not find these glasses helped much to diminish glare for me. Personally, I find the clip-on style problematic in that they don't feel secure on my prescription glasses. Perhaps for those who don't wear prescription glasses the regular style would work well."
5,"OK, But???","Great product but is NOT compatible with a SOYO model SY-K7VTA Pro V1.0 Motherboard/Mainboard for Windows 98SE or Windows XP. Other than that, it's a great product, and very fast, which we've used often in our customer's systems."
4,New Orleans Head Busting!,"I was sort of a detractor to buying Grapetree Cd's. I wasn't interested until i brought D.C.P.'s our time to shine. I heard on the album FTF. FTF IS RIGHT!!!! I MEAN THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY OF THOSE DUDES ON CASH MONEY OR NO LIMIT EXCEPT THEY DONT' RAP ABOUT BLING BLING, THEY RAP ABOUT THE CREATOR, ABOUT JESUS CHRIST THE ETERNAL ONE. This album sounds good, just plain sounds good. I mean you can play it around atheist and they are gonna bounce to it.They are defenitley new orlean's finest! My favorite songs are, Seen it all, Type of Soulja, Burning, Real Woman (LOL a funny song) Live by, Die By, Let's Get it On, and 3 Billion Souljas.I mean this group sound good.BUY IT IF YOU LIKE THE NEW ORLEANS SOUND, BUY IT, for those detractors it still doens't offer anything new, but it is still a good buy."
1,ummmm....errrrrrr.....bbbbrrrrrrr...not really impressive.,"This video only about 9 bucks. No big deal, right? Right. But, even for a retard beginner that doesn't know how to use YouTube, it's only marginally decent. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time. Sorry, TITLE, I love your other products, but this one falls short. What could have made this dvd better is if they made it longer with more content about the basics. They should have FULL segments on preparation, the punches, the purpose of the heavy bag, a brief history of the bag, the types/weights, the importance of it, footwork, etc, etc. It literally seemed like 8 mins of content. What you really need it thisBoxer's Start-Up: A Beginner's Guide to Boxing (Start-Up Sports series)for the basics. I'm not saying that other TITLE videos are bad, but this one is."
3,Cosmic Blobs: Lab Rat Edition (Win & Mac),"I purchased this game for my 8 year old. After going through the tutorial together the game has not seen much play time. The modeling is great, but the fun factor is pretty low. I would not recommend this game for kids under 10."
2,Conservation book,"The book is fine for beginners in the conservation genetics.So the price, I think that is expensive, because the book is just only an introductionto conservation genetics."
3,Getting dated,"This has been one of the leading books for the field. Most useful in a advanced HS or College course.However the material is becoming dated. Needs a newer focus on the new interactive media environment that integrates internet applications rather than thinking of the ""web"" and ""multimedia"" as two areas. They have merged!The book publisher and author needs to study the fields using multimedia such as advertising and the ad agencies, marketing agencies, entertainment agencies, eLearning companies and functions, entire web sites based on interactive multimedia in large companies and so on.Still has value but will need a lot of field experience to sift through what is current and what is just old history."
3,Good Read,"This is my first book by the author. And I must say it was hard for me to read. The story content and the plot of the story was pretty good but the way the author writes took some getting use to. It was different from the other stories that I have read.After receiving bad new regarding her grandfather's health, Maura goes into a business deal with Joshua. She is to marry and have a child with Joshua. And in return he will pay for the medical expenses of Maura's grandfather.There are many instances that the two must face in order to grow in love with each other. Josh swears that he will never love any one again because he was hurt before. But after spending time with Maura he promise is tested.The secondary characters helps to make this a good read. There are some pretty interesting stories within this novel which could possibly have a book of its own. I think Ellen and Rich's story will make a good book."
3,More like a long magazine article than a book,"This is not a bad book and I certainly recommend it for Dallas Cowboy fans or Jerry Jones fans, if there are any. But, it seemed to me to be more like a really long magazine article than a good book. That may largely be because it is written in the mid 1990's and lots of things have happened since that really belong in a book about Jones' life.Overall it is a pretty good read and informative, but I found myself making an effort to finish it rather than having to make an effort to put it down. Dent's book about the Junction boys and Bear Bryant is a much better effort and one that was written at a better time - afterwards rather than during the story. That one was hard to put down."
2,One of their weakest albums,"This album is one of the MG's weakest. It's basically them plowing through a bunch of covers from 1969 or so. The playing is tight (as always) and some of the arrangements are interesting, but it can't even begin to compare with albums like ""Soul Limbo"" and ""Hip Hug-Her."""
3,Under the Covers,"Opening up in a fury with ""The Horse"", The Booker T. Set is one of the least effective of all MGs albums. The opening track is great. It features a rare bass solo by Donald ""Duck"" Dunn and can't be found anywhere else. Their great versions of ""It's Your Thing"" and ""Mrs. Robinson"" (which had some chart success) have shown up on several compilations. But this was a set of all covers, though Booker T. Jones did co-write ""I Never Found a Girl"" with singer Eddie Floyd. The musicianship of Jones, Dunn, Steve Cropper(guitar), and Al Jackson, Jr.(drums) makes it a worthwhile listen, but the title was very ironic, since reportedly Jones wasn't thrilled with the overall product. Afterwards, he and the band would stretch out quickly and effectively with the epic medleys of McLemore Avenue (their instrumental treatment of The Beatles' Abbey Road) and the all originals tour-de-force of Melting Pot."
4,The book of the dead,Well written and entertaining but the crime itself was a bit disappointing. Glad Diogenes got his comeuppance in the end.
5,Edge of your seat,Jyst what you expect from a Preston & Child book. Packed with action and surprises at every turn. I can't wait to read the next book.
2,By far.. this book is the worst.,"I have read every single book by the duo and I can honestly say that this book is terrible. Possibly the worst one from the duo. Other than the prison break portion, everything else was just awful. (If you like prison break, read ""Dirty White Boys"" by Stephen Hunter)What the hell happened to Douglas and Lincoln? Where is the imagination and the flow of Riptide, Ice Limit and Relic?I can't believe I bought this at hard cover price. If you are a fan of the duo, borrow this from the library. It's not worth the paperback price."
2,Where's the beef?,"The book in no way let the reader know that it was the third book in a trilogy. Even though it seemed it was written for people to just pick up and get into, it was difficult to find any relatable qualities to the characters. I was very upset with this book."
5,The Book of the Dead,The Book of the DeadBy: Lincoln Child and Douglas PrestonThis book was very good. I would recommend this book for everyone ages 13 and up. Some things in this book there was some graphic descriptions and gore. But basically the book is about a museum in New York and they need to open up a new exhibit to try to save themselves from the media and make people for get about this robbery that occurs and takes the largest diamond collection in the world from there museum.But something stands in there way.... A curse the tomb that they try to reopen is cursed and mysterious things start happening around it. But basically there were many twist and turns that made this book an all some book.By: Adam Bowe
2,"Oh, what a tangled web . . .","Oh, what a tangled web they weave. Again, this Preston-Child novel, The Book of the Dead, contains so many characters and subplots it's almost too daunting to absorb and seems to bog down the read at times (though I'm still a huge fan of these authors). I stayed with the book to the very end but found myself skipping entire passages to get back to the action. Not on par with their earlier works, to be sure."
4,African American Life,This was an interesting book from start to finish. The CIA trained a Black man to become a terrorist. They taught him everything he knew and pretended he didn't exist because Dan Freedom was Black. It must have been a slap in the face for everyone when they found out that there safe guards didn't work. When one leader falls another one is there to take his place. A most interesting way to get back at someone who treat you like a piece of dirt. I hope today that people aren't treated as Dan Freedmon was or we could be in real trouble. Yes I know the still is segregation in some of the United States but not like it was in the 60's and 70's and that is a good thing.
1,also the book is very bad. Designs stolen!!!,"I don't know about the kit, I got it used without the kit through amazon, but I didn't like the book. The designs are too small and badly done (that is not art), there is no sense of space and decoration. The explaining method is good, but it's mainly took from an Indian book titled 'Art of Mehandi', as some of the artwork. I bet the author is not able to do a decent henna design on her own..."
3,Didn't Strike A 'Resonant' Chord With Me...,"Slightly ambitious on a micro-budget, mostly ludicrous because of the cliche's - long before we ever see a monster, there's the familiar road trip with a bunch of predictable characters, then a 'woman in white' roadside ghost straight out of an episode of 'Supernatural' appears, add an escaped-from-an-institution Serial Killer who thumbs a ride, and none of these elements add anything to the flick except distraction. For the few seconds that the monster is on-screen, we are mildly amused, but the budget (or lack of) prohibited any prolonged satisfaction for me. Once you remember you've already seen this type of story better executed in 'Tremors', it's pretty much over. For the most part tame, lame and not insane enough for my tastes."
4,Excellent Conservative Advice,"Aimed at investors over 50 years of age, this book is filled with conservative advice for everyone. This is not your typical investment book, as it issues warnings and caveats for investors. In light of recent events, the author's warnings should be taken seriously. The savings and loan debacle, the collapse of several insurance companies, and recent corporate bankruptcies (Enron, World Com etc) demonstrate the world has not been safe for investors. The author's position is that the investment world has many dangerous offerings for the investor who does not do careful research."
3,Some advice good some questionable,"The information on the stock market and ratings companies was very useful.However, the suggested method for switching money between mutual funds in your 401k doesn't work. It doesn't work because many mutual funds don't allow you to change between funds as frequently as the method recommended by Mr. Weiss. In fact, some mutual funds require you to keep money in the fund for a year.I started to use the recommended procedure by Mr. Weiss but soon got a nasty gram from Fidelity telling me to stop."
2,Bratz Are Much Better!!,"Okay, I'm going to set the record straight, bratz came out before my scene, just check out the mark on the back of a bratz head.Mattel wanted to update Barbie, but obviously,they didn't have any good ideas, so they copied off of the BratzPack. Big heads and the whole nine yards. They also needed stylish clothes, so again, they had to copy off of the Bratz. Yeah, I admit that its not something we would want are kids wearing, but its real, up close and personal, and in your face. We also don't want to teach r kids to be fake. And thats what my scene teaches you. It's all about the shopping and the primping, and yeah i guess bratz are too, but bratz show diversity.I reccomend bratz to people everywhere from 7 to 77!Go out and take a look at the bratz!"
4,Works with my Bumbleride Indie,"I just got my stroller caddy today and was eager to try it. It works great with my Bumbleride Indie jogging stroller! Since I'm short (4'11), I adjust the handles so that it is horizontal and the caddy lays flat, however, it still works if you adjust the handles at a slight angle. I put a couple bottled waters in there, my phone, keys, etc. It fits everything I need and seems very sturdy. I like that you don't have to remove it in order to fold the stroller. So far so good!"
5,Works great!,"This works well on my Baby Jogger Summit for the fraction of the price of the Baby Jogger counsole. It stays secure and fits two bottled drinks snugly. The zipper compartment is nice for keys, cell phone, wallet, etc. It does not get in the way of the handbrake at all. Great purchase!"
4,What happened to the original?,"I am 57 years old...I saw the Quartermass movies growing up..I can barely remember this sequel that was called ENEMY FROM SPACE, but I do know it was well produced for its time. My question is..why not release Quartermass Experiment AKA THE CREEPING UNKNOWN with the other 2 in a triple scare package...they were all ahead of there time in sci fi ideas and the FX weren't all that bad."
3,"q2 better than q1, pit?","i think this 1's better than 1st via a tad. good story of alien pods makin norm. humans into their zombieslaves whenever they can be close 2 them by bad luck or e z carelessness, in addition to a few very lg. mud blobs @ the end but unfortunate as usual, i.e. scifi films-if they'd show/use more of the monsters they already have, it'd make much better a film. donlevy-quatermass finally seems more like a hero in this/his pic especially since he had nothing 2 do w/ these monstas this time round."
4,Effective and Better than the Original,"This is a fantastic movie full of atmosphere and some real food for thought. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting in particular by Brian Donlevy as Quatermass is very realistic and convincing. I particularly liked the mood setting cinematography by Gerald Gibbs and James Bernard's score. It goes without saying that the script by director Val Guest succeeded on many levels making it engaging to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and thought provoking. Val Guest really knows how to set the mood."
1,Unsafe coffeemaker,"This coffee maker made the best tasting drip coffee but after a little more than a year, the electrical component shorted out. Fortunately I was home at the time to unplug the smoking coffeemaker or my house could have burned down. After contacting Farberware, I learned they no longer make drip coffeemakers (duh) and only offer percolators. Perhaps this is why?"
3,"Title should be ""Guide to Outfitters""","This book is really about outfitters. If you want to plan your own trip, don't bother with this book. It doesn't help you plan your own trip."
5,Beautiful simple and different Christmas book.,"I enjoyed this so much because of the quiet simplicity of this Christmas book. It is so different from most of the stories of Christmas children are exposed to today. It had the quite beauty of poetry, accompanied by beautiful paintings."
4,"Happy & funky, but spotty, but... one standout tune","Far and away, the best song on this album is ""Beautiful People."" If you liked Fatboy Slim's ""Beautiful Night"" or Outkast's ""Hey Ya"", you'll love ""Beautiful People"". There's a few other songs that are close to as good, and the rest are so-so.This is the sort of the album you play on the beach right after you play UB40, and right before you play Fatboy Slim or Daft Punk. You'll crank it up on ""Beautiful People"", I guarantee."
3,Great story!,"I have been a fan of Christopher Stasheff since the book ""The Warlock In Spite of Himself"". I loved the story line of this book, and the characters were likeable. The writing, in my opinion, was a little of the bland side for this author, and the characters could have used just a little bit more rounding out. I think the author did a decent job with this book despite the two minor short falls I mentioned above."
2,best of SOS Band,"The sound is low quality, but the selection of tracks is great, most of their top songs are on here. But it sounds like someone just bootlegged the songs. Even the album art looks homemade. I thought it was put out by major record lable. I will have to search for a quality best of SOS. In the meantime i will keep playin this and put up with sub par sound....which does irratate me."
3,Great in the Open,I bought this for my business to measure attics...and it doesn't work well for that. But for straight linear footage it works fine.
4,4 stars for value,the songs seemed more like parade songs than stadium songs but what a value. Even though this is an instrumental the liner notes list the lyrics for all the songs.
1,Not Worth It,The recordings are terrible. It got the job done for the thing I needed it for. Overall I wouldn't do it again.
2,Little for the money,"While ""Creatures of Skull Island"" are designed with attention to detail, you get few creatures for your money and what you do get has no meanginful articulation. This makes it very boring for kids."
3,GOOD PRODUCT,"Can't give it any high rating b/c product wasn't for my own use, I don't like to leave ratings for products that I don't personally use, but the person that requested it didn't give me any negative feed back so this product apparently met their needs."
3,Amazing Cast-Mediocre Movie,"Homegrown was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Hank Azaria, Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis (!!!) among others; though by no means is it a terrible movie.The acting is good, the humor is very good, and there's the originality of the script/story in that the ones growing the drugs are the ""heroes/good guys.""So it's an interesting plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, and yet it fails to take off.The potential for a great movie was definitely there.In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here..."
4,Tou Lee's review of Congo,"In the deepest, darkest, and most unknown parts of Africa, is the Congo. During an expedition, the team is brutally attacked and killed by what seems as a gorilla. Another expedition is sent to find the answer to what really happened."
3,"Great beginning, and middle but the last 20 pages...","I loved the whole book exept for the last 20 pages. it seems likecrichton was getting borred so he rapped it up in a really pathedicmanner. . also he should not have added the epalog (sp?), cuz itruined the whole felling that you got while reading the book. He screwed it and I am so suprised that the editers let the ending fly. the epalog really. . . gives too many facts and distroyes the idea that the book is fiction."
3,"It was alright, I guess",This book i was not impressed with. I love Michael Crichton's work but i got to say this one stunk. It talked to much about stuff that no one cares about. And the movie is worest! If u are going to buy this I warn u be aware It is not a pretty site.
5,Michael's Best Book,"Having read all of Michael Crighton's work, Congo in my opinion is his best. Please do not compare Congo the book with Congo the movie - which was a hideous interpretation at best. I'm still scratching my head over Mr. Crighton's approval on that particular screenplay. The book is simply wonderful."
3,Good but not outstanding,"Much of the book is about fantasy computer technology, which is dated by modern standards, making the messages look silly. This is the story of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot and Captain Charles Munro share the adventure finding the lost city of Zinj in the Congo jungle. They are challenged by a group of Gorilla-like animals. Elliot's sign-language female gorilla supports the effort."
3,Entertaining but I didn't feel I was involved in the story!,"Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors and Congo just didn't get me involved like many of his other novels. The focus seemed to be more technology oriented (interesting though) than focusing on the characters or the suspense aspects of many of his other novels. One of my favorites is ""The Great Train Robbery."""
3,Promissing in the beginning,"When I began the book, it started off with a great opening and I was excited. But after the beginning, the book slowed down, and had a few bright sopts for about 200 pages. It picked up near the end and the suspense began building and i read the remanider in an hour or so, but when I got to the last page, I was pretty dissapointed, hence my 3 star rating. Another thing I dissliked was a lot of scientific junk that made the book boring, then again if you read it in 1980 when it was first published, it might have been more fascinating. So it had bright spots, but for the most part it was slow-moving."
4,Gorilla Attack,Crushed skulls and bodies lay everywhere in the destroyed expedition camp. A grainy shape is seen on tape and it resembles a gray gorilla but gorillas aren't gray. What could have caused this carnage thought ERTs employee Karen Ross. The secret may lie in a gorilla with a 620 sign vocabulary. All the action can be found in Michael Crightons Congo.With the first expedition team dead they plan to send out a new team in less than three days. Karen Ross the captain of the team is determined to get success on this mission. With Peter Elliot and gorilla Amy they must take more supplies. As they get deeper into the Congo Amy starts acting differently. She runs off and returns late at night.What is going on and why are the gorillas attacking? How did those gray gorillas come anyway? So many questions and all will be answered in Michael Crightons Congo.
3,This book is alright if you really like Michael Crichton.,"If you really like Michael Crichton books,this book is OK. If you're trying to finda good book, don't read this. Congo haslots of techno stuff which is quiteboring and doesn't make any sense. Ifyou like books like these, it's good."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read,"Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked."
2,A Childs' Fairy Tale,"I was suprised in Michael Crichton that he would actually write something so crumby. A five year old could understand the plot of this story with killer gorillas. Plus this story had no character development at all. I mean the characters weren't changed after what had happened to them in the jungle. I also think the ending was very cheesey how they walked away with out a scratch. Well, besides the guys that did die in the city of Zinj. The people that made it out were all losers. Those people were the ones I thought would have died in Zinj. Over all this book was pretty bad for being written by such a great author."
2,Too Informational. Could Have Really Been Something.,"Congo was the first Michael Crichton novel I read, and I just could never get into it. So since it was Crichton's first that I had read, I read it again. No good. The book is way too informational. Crichton should have focused more on the gorillas and the jungle. None of the characters were interesting, so I really didn't feel anything when they died. Too bad after all the good Crichton's this really could have been something."
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"The reason that this is a terrible book is that the first part is excellent but the end is lame. I was very much into the characters and the plot, but in the end the entire climax was analogous to ""And then the hero woke up.""Please don't waste you time on this book."
5,Shields is terrific!,"The first Carol Shields book I read was ""The Stone Diaries"" which of course deserved all its awards. Then ""Larry's Party"" which, though it was somewhat ignored by the literary press, was every bit as enjoyable as ""Diaries."" By then I had realized that Shields is one of our greatest living novelists. I picked up ""Small Ceremonies"" knowing it was nearly 25 years old -- her first published novel -- and expecting it to be less than those two later books. I was wrong. ""Small Ceremonies"" is simply a terrific book. Buy it. Read it."
3,Helpful if you work at it,I am not too familiar with CAmeron's writing but she is obviously successful in her own right. I bought it as an aspiring writer and had to make myself finish it. Thought it was trite and slow and after finishing and working at it I got some stuff out of it but boy does it require work.
4,little dimmer than I am,"It worked good until it got dropped. More decretive than practical in a power failure, since the other oil lamps I have are much brighter."
2,"The item itself is nice, shipping method is horrible!","The lamp itself is nice, and the chimney itself is real glass. I can attest to that because it arrived in pieces. Whomever packed the box used three plastic air pillows on one side of the box only. Horrible! Thus the lamp was only protected from impact in one direction. It's a shame since the lamp itself seems nice. I see a number of complaints along the same lines, so maybe Amazon should force some Quality Control on this company?"
4,Love,"This is a lovely movie. It makes one believe that true, unselfish love is possible after all. I would recommend to all."
2,Tropical Rain Forest Revisited on Amazon Rainforest,The artist used the identical recording of tropical birdsongs from his Tropical Rain Forest cd; overlaid it with a new musical soundtrack; and gave it a new name! Together these are jarring sounds. There are better cd's of bird recording than what you'll find on this re-tread.
1,not what I wanted,thought that this book was the first 15 comics of bionicle but I was wrong. In stead of that the shipped me the freakin' official guide. I was really disapointed. If your looking for the comics don't get this book.
2,A Disappointment,"Utterly basic, nothing a high school student couldn't figure out from looking at the documents."
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be.,"I bought this DVD a while ago and just recently watched it. I was not impressed. I was told how hilarious this movie was and how great it was, so when I saw it for a good deal I purchased it. I thought it was stupid. There were a few good moments in it but not enough to keep you fully entertained. If your looking for a movie light on comedy and entertainment then this is for you."
4,good,This one was good. Alot of the folks from The State are in it which I appreciate. Has a loosy-goosy improv feel to it as well. I like that.
4,Puerile and Raunchy but funny,"""Role Models"" is a movie for people with a taste for Wil Ferrell, Adam Sandler, etc. type of humor. The plot is of 2 coworkers, who sell a power drink to schools in an anti-drug program, who get into legal trouble and have to serve time in a volunteer youth program in lieu of going to jail. Paul Rudd plays the straight man to Seann William Scott's goofy, bad boy and the two youth actors are perfect accompaniments to the adults. The story is silly but a lot of fun.Jane Lynch is particluarly hilarious in her role as the director of the youth program and Elizabeth Banks does well in her minimal role as the attorney\ex-girlfriend of Paul Rudd. As a side note, if you are a KISS fan, you will enjoy many parts of this movie.This movie is not an Academy Award winner, but it is a fun film and the actors are all very good in their parts, creating believeable characters."
3,Silly fun...,"Those who love the improv antics from Reno 911 and the movies of Christopher Guest will enjoy this film. It is a simple buddy movie, with its main flaw being the somewhat lacking chemistry between Rudd and Scott. However, a bevy of colorful supporting characters are what really make this film. Kerri Kenny-Silver and Jane Lynch, who are well-versed in the art of comedic improv, really stand out. Also, some original plot points and very adult content make for an entertaining diversion. It's not quite up there with 40-Year-Old Virgin or similar fare, but check it out for a few laughs."
4,Dogz,I purchase the Dogz game for my 7 year old. She has been entertained by the game so far. You do have to read in this game so a young child that is not reading would need a parent near by. Dogz has turned out to be a favorite game. I purchase a gentle used game and it came in perfect condition.
1,WARNING!,"Die Toten Hosen are one of my favorite bands of all time, but I'll be the first to admit that this is the worst album they ever released. Sure, I salute their urge to branch out but the execution falls flatter than Marlin Brando jumping off the Sears Tower. Do not buy this album unless you really need to own everything by them."
3,Stick with it,The story is not one of JAK's best. The female lead is appropriately fiesty but a little too fierce and unforgiving. The male lead is unusually quiet and unassuming - atypical for JAK. It all comes together eventually but not with the magic we've come to expect with titles published under the Castle pseudonym. Buy it on sale if you want to try it.
3,Disappointing,"Having read the reviews here, I was prepared for this book to seem dated; I didn't actually have much of a problem with that. What I did have a problem with was the characters - they're rather 2-dimensional and there's not much that's engaging about the personalities of the H &H or clever about their interactions. By the '90s JAK had learned to create more rounded characters and amusing banter between them - I'm a huge fan of her work from that decade - but I don't think this early book is worth anything close to the $6.99 they're charging for it on kindle."
1,deceptive photo,I ordered this carrier despite reviews that mentioned its small size. Big mistake. It is much much smaller than it appears in the photo. I am returning it for a larger carrier.
4,Lightweight,Works well and holds a lot of our wood. Handle is convenient to carry logs. Material is strong enough. I like it.
3,Too short for indoor use.,"While the construction is good, the 15"" length is too short for firewood, plus without the end ""caps"" it doesn't keep the floor as clean. It would be perfect for taking camping when the desire is for ease of hauling wood as opposed to trying to keep the house clean. Since my use is for an indoor wood stove, it's not ideal."
1,Returned it after one use,"I owned a Farberware hand mixer that was just perfect. It was light, had multiple speeds, easy to use, powerful enough, and lasted for 20 years. When it finally died, I wanted a Farberware again and so bought this one. BUT....they don't make 'em like they used to! In a standard mixing bowl like I've always used, this mixer sent pudding flying all over my kitchen! I finally had to mix the pudding in the sink in order to contain the mess. I immediately packaged this back up and shipped it back, and will now look for a different brand. Maybe a Hamilton Beach, since I've been so happy with others of their products."
2,I wanted to like it... I really did!,"I love Tim Meadows! And I love Leon Phelps on SNL. And I love Will Farrel too! Unfortunatly this movie just wasn't funny.... I don't think I laughed more than once or twice. I was so disappointed because it should have been hilarious.. The supporting cast was good.... Karyn Parsons (of Fresh Prince), Will Farrel, Tiffani Amber Thiessen and BILLY DEE BILLY DEE! And who doesn't love making fun of outdated 70's guys and cheesy pick up lines? I don't know what went wrong, but it DID go wrong."
2,Another unneccessary SNL production.....,"While i certainly don't think this was an entirely terrible film, I do think that SNL movies should just stop being made!!! I can't imagine what could possibly come out next! As a five minute skit, Ladies Man, was always very funny and one of the better parts of the show. Tim Meadows has had quite a long run on the series, and he is a very gifted commedian and actor. To date the best SNL skit turned movie have been the Wayne's World movies. Ladies Man did have it's share of dumb laughs, but it's hardly one of the best comedies of the year. It's just a very dragged out skit of what you see on the show. Like I said, it had enough laughs to keep it somewhat interesting, but I wouldn't buy this movie. I'd wait for this one cable(my husband rented this one, so i can't take full responsiblity for it!)"
1,I feel all oily!,"This movie STINKS. The Ladies Man is such a horrible waste of talent, it literally embarrassses the pants off comic geniuses Tim Meadows and Lee Evans. On the other hand, for this Mens Lady there IS one good thing about The Ladies Man: literally embarrassing the pants off comic geniuses Tim Meadows and Lee Evans! NICE TUSHIES!"
3,Not what I expected,"I rented this movie because I really like SNL and ""The Ladies Man"" skit. This was a mistake to make the movie. In the movie, Leon Phelps gets a letter from one of the former people he made love to. Now they are rich and they want to be with him. He is also looking for a job, since he was fired for being to vulgar. A couple of really funny seens still can't help this movie very much. I would give this movie 2 stars. Will Ferrell is pretty funny. On the other hand, the DVD is better than the movie. There is a fairly good commentary. Don't buy this movie, maybe rent it. ""A Night At The Roxbury"" is much better (which I own on DVD)."
4,Much better than I expected.,"...which wasn't much, I have to say. More intelligent, wittier, almost no body function humor. It's not a thought-provoking movie, mind you, I'm not saying that, but it follows the Hollywood formula well, with an interesting lead character (fully realized performance from co-writer Tim Meadows), a believable love interest, and the expected happy ending.Bonus: Julianne Moore has a cameo."
1,I can't recommend this,"I had seen this once before and liked the silly humor but seeing it again I wondered how I missed all the crude and rude all over the story and jokes. Yes, I should have realized that is what this film is all about but I hold hope that there are films that are funny without offensive jokes and gags."
3,Poor addition to the series.,Continuation of the Time Bender series with Lafayette O'Leary wandering helplessly through his own delusions helped by a limited cast. Lacks the spontaneity & elan of the earlier books & meanders to a predictable & uninspiring conclusion. Don't read if you wish to preserve the flavour of the other novels.

2,Disappointed,"The opening song, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, is a wonderfully upbeat rendition and is the highlight of this CD. The rest of the compilation, however, is disappointing. It's dreary and depressing and includes a folk song about a dead frozen cat. Sorry, but this is not exactly the mood I want to evoke around the holidays."
2,"One great song, and then.....","Be glad you cannot order this in time for Christmas delivery. By next year, you should be able to fish this collection out of the bargain bin at Sam Goody's. I heard the lead track, ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" on the radio, and thought it awesome. It opens with a gentle rockabilly feel from the Barnaked Ladies, then Sarah McLachlan jumps in to finish the song (ironically, this track is from 1996 before both artists became well-known). It is a great holiday song. The rest of the compilation ranges from decent to ""What the hell is this?"" It is one thing to stumble upon holiday songs with which you're not familiar (Delerium's ""Terra Firma"" and Meryn Cadell's ""The Cat's Carol""). It is entirely another thing when these newly-discoverd holiday songs elicit more confusion than comfort. Again, just play the lead track and possibly Maren Ord's version of ""The Christmas Song,"" then turn to your collection of Peanuts' holiday songs for the remainder of the season."
5,Christmas Songs,"What the season is all about. Touching, funny, EXCELLENT MUSIC! Please don't miss this one. Defers the Commercialism blues and will help you de-stress beautifully during a hectic season."
3,Good price at Amazon on these!!,"I have been using the Gilmour hose connector system for a couple of years now, and it certainly makes switching from nozzles to other attachments easier. My only complaints are that after a time, lime and calcium build up and make the ""disconnect"" and ""re-connect"" a little difficult, but I soak the pieces in CLR, and that removes the build-up. The second complaint is that the washers included with the connectors don't last very long (not even a season), so I have to switch out washers more frequently than I would like. Amazon has great prices on these, as compared to Lowe's, where I have purchased the connectors in the past."
3,berserker clan,"The left leg of this dragon is not touching the ground normally, so I use just the rock and its tail to make it stand. Other than that, nice figurine"
3,Daniell's Tyndale,"This 429 page (+ xxxv) hardcover volume is a nice appearing work. It contains an up-to-date ""translation"" of William Tyndale's 1534 New Testament. No mention on the quality of paper used. The type is clear and well printed.David Daniell is well qualified for this effort. He does a masterful job, and the book is a great value in the paperback edition, but the hardcover is priced much too high. It is poorly bound, using glue injection, the pages will not lay open! As the glue hardens in the future, you can expect pages to fall out.I am very glad I bought the book, Tyndale's work is worthy of study, and shows great respect for God's Word. Tyndale himself suffered greatly to get the Word into the hands of all English speakers... Surely the work would be more popular if it could be freely quoted.For your money, buy the paperback edition..."
4,Tyndale's New Testament,"I have just learned of Mr. Tyndale's work and what he did for all of us, he translated the Bible when it was against the law to do so, even being burned at the stake for it. I have wanted to read his words. And am taking time to use them as a part of by Bible Study. Most passages are the same words as used in the King James Bible. And He received no credit. I don't think he did it for credit, but did it for all of us. I WOULD RECOMEND IT to anyone who is a Bible studend and is looking for another hero! E. Elmer"
2,"Too much singing, not enough real content","Bought this for my 17 month old (teaching her SPanish). She was not impressed. It is filled with song after song, but no skits, no real content. It gets tired, fast. You're better off getting ""Me gusta ser yo"" and ""bienvenida la primavera""."
5,Simply the best.,"1) Smells great.2) Doesn't track everywhere.3) Easy to maintain litter box.Easiest way to use this litter:1) Purchase a sifting litter box like the feline pine box or the Breeze. DO NOT buy the Van Ness sifting box, the holes are too big.2)Scoop solids daily with a pellet-specific scoop like the one that comes with the Breeze.3) Sift urine soaked sawdust to the bottom compartment by either shaking the box side to side or scooping the pellets around until the all the sawdust falls through to the bottom. I go with the latter because I don't feel like lifting it.4) Enjoy the rest of your day not worrying about the litter box.Remember to empty out the compartment with the sawdust every few days. I have 1 cat, so you may have to do it more often if you have multiple cats. I also keep the Breeze urine pads as lining in the lower part in case any urine trickles down and to absorb the smell of the sawdust."
3,Sensor,Pretty tiny piece for the price but guess that's Lego's . It was for someone special so guess it was worth it. :)
3,Good but one fatal flaw,i have a large collection of LP's that I am finally committed to getting into iTunes. I was using Audacity but it lacked a few features I could use to make the job easier so I got the trial version of PeakLE. It's a great program but lacks one very important feature. You can break a long recording into smaller units (think LP's broken up into tracks) BUT you can only write those tracks out to CD. In this version of the program you can't save them to files. This means you I would have to write each LP out to CD then import the CD into iTunes. Not going to happen. The non LE version of the software allows regions (as they call the smaller units) to be written to disk. Unfortunately that version is around $350.On well it's either Audacity or Sound Studio.
3,MCAT THINKING,"While this book is better than most MCAT guides on the market, it does have some flaws. PRAISE: The questions are excellent! Just like the MCAT! FLAW: Often the questions pertain to information not previously mentioned or reviewed in the previous passage. EXAMPLE: A question from the first section involved answer choices of London forces, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole moments. None of these terms or concepts were discussed previously! SO: Basically you need to have a good foundation before you get this book. Once you do buy the book, IT DOES TEACH YOU HOW TO THINK LIKE THE MCAT!!! Just remember to review the knowledge elsewhere!"
2,Pulling back,"2 1/2A mild, mellow, modest mediocrity from a band expected to release somewhat more edgily engaging indie rock."
3,Magic and mystery,"This is the coming-of-age novel of a young Navaho boy, Younger Brother, as he learns the world of his people and learns the secrets of his tribe's wiseman and learns the ways of the larger world. Younger Brother helps a friend, The Big Man, with car problems. He goes on a long quest and finds he can survive on his own. He saves his horse from thieves. All the tales are told with a background of magic and mystery, with the mountains and desert as a magnificent setting.Newbery winner."
2,NOT univeral,"The build quality seems fine, however this mount is not universal. I have an Epson 8700 UB projector and this mount is not even close to being compatible. Bummer."
3,Wonder what it's like to work in a broadcast studio?,"If you are considering working in broadcasting, or just have a curiousity about what goes on behind the scenes, then this will give you the feel of broadcasting work. Experience it, and go from there."
2,The quickest $110 I wasted,"These sheers work great when they are new. I bought one of these in a fancy nursery in Santa Barbara where I was told they would last em a life time. Yes, They cut through things beautifully even when you have a a bunch of branches adding up to half an inch and sometimes 3/4"". But the honeymoon lasts only a month or two even for lite use at home. They become rusty very quickly. The blade on the one I got became black with rust after a year and I stopped using it after that. I have bought cheap sheers from the 99-cent store that have not rusted at all under similar use. I just bought a new Felco last month and have been keeping the blade edge dry by wiping it and sharpening the blade once a week. I have used it on cut flowers inside the house only and it is already rusty. The rust does not come off easy. There are youtube videos on dismantling, oiling, cleaning and sharpening these but I think either Felco's were always over-rated or they have gone down in quality."
2,defective,"less than 2 weeks the silver part between the two handles fell off...can I find it (NO)--is it under warranty?? will I have to pay for a part that is defective, probably......will let amazon know and will see what happens..."
4,ohio pruner,"The FelcoF-8 is handy easy to use and comfortable. It works on plants, bushes, and almost everything does a great job. You will not be disappointed if you use it."
4,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,I'M A FAN I OWN EVERY CD FROM THESE GUYS AND I KNOW THEY ARE MISSING TRACKS. NOTHING IS ON THIS CD FROM THEIR FIRST 2 RECORDS AND ONLY 2 TRACKS ARE ON HERE FROM SUPERNATURAL. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU PEOPLE BUT IN MY AREA IN VIRGINIA RADIO STATIONS WORE OUT GODSEND AND INTO JESUS. I DO LIKE THE 2 NEW TRACKS SUGARCOAT IT AND CHANCE BUT THEY SHOULD'VE MADE THIS A DOUBLE ALBUM AND INCLUDE EVERY SONG FROM THEIR SELF-TITLED CD TO SUPERNATURAL
3,Borrrrrring!!!!!,"This game is really boring. I can see why it came free with the PS3. I would not spend any money to buy this game. The graphics are really good, but the game itself is boring. Like they barely put any real work into it. I advise renting before buying. Same vehicles, same tracks (basically). no customizing. Very Boring!!!!"
4,Welcome to Motorstorm.,"Back before I had a PS3 this was my favorite PS3 game. I demoed it at Walmart on release day and was blown away by the intense graphics. Forward to just recently when I got a Ps3, I still love this game. The game play is tuned to almost perfection and the idea of multi-levels is great. The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that the number of levels is relatively small and sometimes you will launch off a ramp, only to run straight into a rock. (also the loading times for vehicles is terrible, but that is because blu-ray has low transfer rates and is not this games fault) Overall though, worth the 19.99."
5,Don't leave this book behind!,"Bart Yates writes a poignant and somewhat believable account of the Noah York, a seventeen-year-old high school student who falls in love with his neighbor, J.D. Noah's mother is a bucketful of dysfunction, but she must be as an accomplished poet. While she's at times permissive and at others psychotic, Noah must navigate the waters of his adolescence without losing his own sanity, or losing his life. Though Yates writes with style and insight, there are a few places where the boundaries of believability are stretched thin...yet, he manages to avoid stepping completely past those points and does so without coming across as schmaltzy or trite. It's been a long while since I've read a novel with a gay central character that hasn't covered the same ground that everyone else has. ""Leave Myself Behind"" is that break-through novel."
5,Rockin' Nolee,"My grandmother bought this doll for my b-day and I love it! She comes with the most adorable outfits, and her dog's really cute too! I think she's the best My Scene doll yet! When my grandmother bought me the doll, I couldn't wait to get it out of the box! Love the DVD! Love everything!"
4,Great Product,"Great Product, Easy to install, cost effective and great manual.I have installed Sanyo PLV-Z60 projector in my Media room it works greats. To fix projector to the mount you might have to buy three screws, as provided screws are small. Secondly make sure the Stud is in center of room as top 3 screw fit in one line."
5,Great Product,Easy to install. I was able to install my Optoma HD70 with this Projector Mount in no time. There were no complications. I highly recommed this unit to others.
4,"Great mount, okay hardware, hard setup!","I loved the fact that it was so easy to put together. I almost had a hardtime figuring it out, but it turns out that no matter how u put the projector on, it fits! It was easy hardware setup and super fast to understand as far as making the angles.Now for the bad stuff! Unless three people live with u to help you, you can rest assured the installation will be difficult. The mount itself was easy, no doubt. But from one projector user to another, setting up the projector to hit the screen at the right angle and perpindicularly was super hard. You have to hold the mount on the ceiling while trying to mark out where the screw holes go without moving so you can keep the perfect angle you set up. Other than that, it was superb. The only reason it was a 4 and not a 5 is when i tried to tighten the angle, the screws came through the drywall of the ceiling.P.s. if anyone has a better way to install please let me know, i have to move it!Newburns@comcast.net"
3,the NOT THE RIGHT SCREWS FOR MY PROJECTOR mount,"The mount looks excellent. The projector I purchased was listed on the site as one that worked with this particular mount. When we got it out to mount it - I was excited - thinking this would be easy - UNTIL I tried putting it together for the first time and realizing the screws that came with it were all TOO big. I ended up at Bet Bu (which did not have any mounts in stock) and bought a TV trey mount and the screws that came with it worked. Not the cheapest or easiest solution - but it now works. Before you order, even if your projector is listed - make sure it will work..."
1,Buyer beware!,"After lots of product research, I ordered this toaster thru an Amazon seller, antonline. I got it right away, but it didn't work. The lever wouldn't go down all the way. Antonline referred us to the manufacturer warranty. The manufacturer said they discontinued this item in 2001. They told me I could send it to them with all purchase info, but they could only replace it with some other product. I fixed the toaster by taking it apart and jamming something in to allow space for the lever. It had a manufacturing flaw. I don't know how common this flaw is - I'm guessing it's why there are so many for sale online but none in the stores. Farberware unloaded them."
2,So-So,"This movie is very close to the original novel and rather entertaining. The animation and sound, however, is really something to laugh at. Still, it's fun to watch if you're bored."
4,My 10 year old daughter loves it!,Purchased for my daughter in combo with a new DS. Didn't think this would be her favorite but she absolutely loves it. She also has one of the Nintendogs games and loves it as well. She plays both games equally.
2,Catholics,This book was purchased as a book club reading. I found the basic story line interesting but characters underdeveloped and the plot uneven. I would not read it again and would not recommend it.
2,Whale Fan,"I was disappointed with this cd, because I thought I was getting clear whale songs. Instead, you hear waves lapping at your boat with wind chime sounds and other non-natural sounds that seem to drown out the whale songs. The whale songs, I felt, are not to clear. I couldn't hear them over the other stuff and didn't know if I was hearing one or not. This is my opinion; I didn't like it, but maybe you would."
3,Where are the whale sounds?,It would have been nice to know that thisDVD is more music than whale sounds. Was disappointed...
5,Off the shelves,"I have used this mascara for several years and LOVE it. I wear contacts and it does irritate my eyes,it never flakes off, and it wears really well on your eyelashes. Several months back I realized I could not find it on the shelves in the stores. I finally gave up looking and decided to go on line. Thanks to Amazon I am once again able to use my FAVORITE mascara. Thank you, Amazon."
5,From one who became a cruiser,"This book is one of my favorites, and I read a LOT of books. It is educational, inspirational, entertaining, and just plain fun. My copy is dog-eared, worn, and obviously repeatedly read. I have written a detailed review on SailingIsLife, so I won't repeat all that here.All I can say is that this book not only educated and entertained me, it solidified my dreams about cruising to the point that my wife and I, and now several friends, have become real cruisers. Not the ""World Cruisers"" most people think of, but Practical Cruisers, as described in this book, who have taken a number of shorter cruises and who continue to take longer and more diverse cruises as our knowledge and confidence increase.Whether it inspires you to cruise, or simply entertains and enthralls you, it is a book well worth reading, and reading again."
5,Watch this movie all alone at night & it will scare you!,"Okay, I am gonna show this one at my next slumber party! I didn't see it see it when the movie 1rst came out( I'm only 16), but I had the pleasure to see it on AMC one night & I thought since it was an old movie, it wouldn't be scary. Needless to say, I was VERY wrong! I admit, it has a stupid plot(even thought it would be kinda cool if someone would pay you that much money just to stay in a haunted house for one night), but the acting makes up for it. I mean, it was like I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. It's one of those ""who's gonna die next"" movies, & I promise if you haven't seen it before or even heard the ending, you'll be suprised w/ the outcome. So if you're ever in the mood to be freaked out ""old-school style"", then watch this, K?"
4,A CLASSIC,"THIS MOVIE WAS VERY WELL DONE. VINCENT PRICE IS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. THE REST OF THE CAST IS GOOD ALSO. WITH SIMPLE SPECIAL EFFECTS. IT YOU ENJOY WATCHING THE CLASSICS BEFORE ALL THE HIGH TECH THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. NO SLASHING, NO GORE, JUST SCARES YOU, KNOWING SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN."
4,"These are no good against the dead, only the living.","This William Castle/Vincent Price thriller classic will satisfy fans of both old black & white horror films and those who dig Vincent Price movies.Price plays a wealthy bored type whose wife is only around for his loot. He throws a party for ""her"" - inviting a mixed bag of a gang who could use the $10,000 he promises them all: the catch? Just stay the night... Along the way they'll have to avoid basement holes full of acid, blind, weird maids scurrying around in the dark and other assorted chills.Remade & re-imagined in 1999, the new version is a flashy more disturbing romp starring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Jannsen as the psychotically bored, overly blinged couple. However, the wacky original contains lots of scary goodies. It's perfect for those who like good old fashioned frights!"
3,A must-see for Vincent Price fans,"I saw this movie as a young girl in the 60s. I have my own copy now and watch it with my 10 year old son! Price is excellent with that expressive,menacing face of his. The special effects are crude, but entertaining.The acid bath scene is a highlight!!"
3,Not their best work,"While I wouldn't be as harsh as some reviewers, this is certainly not the best effort they've made. The story is fine and the message is fine, it's just not that creative or done with the excellence you might expect. I enjoyed this more than my wife (she would probably give it only 2 stars)."
3,Goofy with a side of brilliant,"The inspiredly eclectic Jazz guitarist has arguably put forth one of the most engagingly consistent compositional body of works, so searching through unpopular back records doesn't seem fruitless. Having said that, this is highly obscure for a reason. Sounding of early experimental compilation, this could rest as comfortable on early Zorn recordings as anywhere else, an overstuffed mash of often intriguing ideas strained though an adolescent, poorly produced edge with too much spoken word."
1,Bad information,"I cannot recommend this book. It contains misinformation. As an example, the entry on Sorrel Tree (page 110) confuses two completely different trees, Umbellularia californica and Oxydendrum arboreum. Also, many of the range maps are drastically off. It has lovely illustrations, but if you can't trust the information, what good is it?"
5,A timeless gift of beauty and sentiment,"I purchased this item as a wedding gift for my son and daughter-in-law. They were ecstatic about the beauty, meaning and timelessness of the piece. I believe the price-point value for this is incredible. As gifts go, one can hardly purchase anything that could be more personal, beautiful and heartfelt as these art blessings."
5,"A splendid, extremely useful book","Take Back Your Time is the kind of book that everyone on the planet should read. We're all running around like maniacs most of the time, desperate to get an endless amount of mostly useless things accomplished. Jasper tells how to separate the wheat from the chaff and focus on what's really important. Her suggestions are sensible, intelligent, creative. My husband and I have both read the book and are now trying to apply all the helpful ideas to our lives."
4,Very cute movie,"This is one of the Bring it on movies that is definitely targeted to a younger demo than the original, but that doesn't take away from the plot (two squads from opposite coasts fighting with each other under a ""West side Story"" plot formula). All of the actors put on enjoyable performances making it a good viewing experience."
4,A great first Cosi for young people,"Most attempts to update operas that were originially set in previous eras fall short, but this production's flower child update to the 1960's works, mostly because the producers made the quality of the performers a top priority, starting with the beautiful lyric soprano voice of Dorothea Roschmann as Fiordiligi. To the high quality of the singing throughout, add hippies romping around in colorful and creative get-ups and the players climbing out of the orchestra pit as if it's a swimming pool, and this production becomes an ideal way to introduce younger people to some of the most heavenly music in all of opera."
4,Good stuff,I liked this cd alot especially disc one everything flows together nicely. Disc two was alright too but my taste perferred disc one.
3,Prophet,"I recently bought Jerusalem's ""Prophet"" through Amazon.com. 2 of the songs were not reflective of Jerusalem's usual offering. Other than that ""Prophet"" is worth owning for the collector of Jerusalum music. Maybe 3 1/2 stars out of 5 stars."
5,Marvel a Brilliant Marvel!,"This has to rank among my top favorite serials of all-time. Tom Tyler looks magnificent as our flying hero (although nearly all of his stunts are by ace stunt wizard, David Sharpe). This is a perfect rendition of a comic book. The cast plays it completly straight and the climax of each cliffhanger leave you breathless. This classic serial ranks way up there along with: Daredevils of the Red Circle, Spy Smasher, King of the Texas Rangers, Manhunt in Darkest Africa (with Joan Marsh a terrific heroine); and G-Men Versus the Black Dragon (blessed with another feisty heroine, Constance Moore). Doesn't Republic Studios realize that we serial buffs would like to see ALL their serial library! Would love to view ""Jungle Girl"" with Francis Gifford, ""Drums of Fu Manchu"", Jack Armstrong, etc."
4,Great buy!,Very pleased with the quality and content of the DVD set. A great serial with a great story. Stunts were amazing for that time.
1,Save your money - buy a bic!,"Not too happy with this purchase.The lighter did not look like the photo when received and it lit about five times before the fluid ran out. I was unable to refill it, eventhough I tried numerous times.Basically, with shipping and handling, I spent $20 for a lighter that barely worked & never will again. Don't waste your money ..."
5,Great puzzles,The White Mountain puzzles are great. Good quality and many choices. Purchased the Florida and Massachusetts puzzles for an Uncle who spends a great deal of time making puzzles and he loved these. Ordered and received on time for Christmas as promised by seller.
1,Still searching,"I spend a lot of time searching for personal care products that are safe to use with eczema, and it seems the most difficult to find are shampoo and conditioner that are free of both scents and dyes. I had hoped this was the end of my search, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. It felt as if some sort of film was left on my hair and it was even somewhat sticky. Closer inspection revealed residue left on my scalp as well. With the sticky texture, I couldn't even comb through my hair. I tried it with the Free & Clear conditioner, but it made little difference. The worst part was that, even without the dyes and perfume, whatever IS in this stuff actually exacerbated my eczema.Oh how I miss Christophe's Purely Natural collection of hair products!"
3,Not the best sulfate free shampoo,"I purchased this product after reading the wonderful reviews; however, my experience wasn't the best. I suffer from eczema, so in that regard, the product is fantastic in cleaning the scalp. The problem that I noticed was once I washed the shampoo out of my hair, it was extremely dry and brittle. It took a lot of conditioner to replenish moisture."
3,"Doesn't irritate skin, but also doesn't lather!","Definitely not enough lathering going on.....I liked the Walgreen's free and clear shampoo better, but it's been discontinued.... I will try the Vanicream one. With this one, I feel like I use more shampoo than necessary because it doesn't lather and spread around as well. So, it's seems like I going through the shampoo faster than usual, which means more money long-term. Too bad Free and Clear hasn't fixed this problem yet. I would buy it, if they did."
5,A must read for all Civil War and cavalry buffs!,"Few know that the Gettysburg campaign did not end with the famous Picketts Charge. There was three cavalry actions during or after Picketts Charge. This book vividly describes these three actions. It describes Farnsworth's Charge and a whole chapter on the brave soldier, Elon Farnsworth and the great controversy surrounding his death. It also includes Merritt's Regulars on South Cavalry Field and the Battle of Fairfield."
4,pretty sicc,"this cd is pretty tight. raided kinda changed his style, but he still flows sicc like, and his madman homies are tight too. this shows that raided still has a promising future ahead of him. get it."
5,Bathwater's Hot,I ordered this book for my daughter's baby shower. it was her favorite book.as a child so her copy was beat up. i was on a mission to find a copy that was brand new to pass on to her daughter. The book was shipped immediately and I received in faster than i thought and in time for.the shower. I was so happy i was able.to find a copy and in brand new condition.
1,Review above right,Don't get caught short - lol - When you order these 505 shorts check your cart before you hit checkout - it will say 550 relaxed fit etc.. but I ordered 505?????? Thanks to the reveiew before me I didn't fall for this - my legs look real skinny in 550's = lol
1,A lot of wasted talent,What a great voice! What a lousy album! One wonders why such a great singer is wasting her time on these second class arrangements and questionable song selection. Perhaps she needs a new producer if she's ever going to make the album she's really capable of.
5,D D D D Dora!,"My 2 year old LOVES Dora the Explorer. We now have a few of these tapes, since Dora is not on t.v. all day long. This tape, the second in our collection, is adorable. She loves the episode with the little blue bird (where does he have to go? To the little blue tree!). I like these videos because they do teach the children some basic Spanish words, instead of just having them glued to watch the show. Now my daughter uses words like ""Vamanos!"" and ""delicioso"" correctly, and at 2, I think this is a pretty big accomplishment. We recommend Dora the Explorer videos to everyone we know and give them as birthday gifts. They are always a hit!"
4,Inversions,"This is a fun book to have, because it teaches you how to write your name right-side up and upside down. You can use a variety of lettering, too."
1,Terrible,"Just plain bad, the way it is put together is poor and disjointed. just don't even waste your money my husband got it thinking I would like it. Just read the other reviews that say its bad. they are all right ! just don't buy this book it sucks"
2,Big disappointment,"I started reading this series when I was a teenager and loved them. I was thrilled when I saw the advertisements for the movies. I was pleased with Love Comes Softly. I thought the characters they picked for Marty and Clarke (especially Clarke) were just about perfect for the parts. I understood why Landon chose to cast an older Missy, and was okay with other changes they made to the book. I was so excited to see the sequel. What a bummer!! I thought the sequel was HORRIBLE!! Did it even come from the same book? Where were Marty and Clarke? They were very present in the book. We weren't even introduced to the rest of the family! I just don't understand why this movie is getting such high reviews. Maybe if I hadn't read any of the original books I might have enjoyed it more."
2,The price is ridht but the information about the item is not,"The information about the item was not rigth, I need the oxigen sensor before the catalist and it was noticed as it, that's why i bought it, but when i received the item my surprise was that it was the wrong one."
1,"NO, NO, NO....","No, no, no.... One of the biggest disappointments I've ever owned. Not the Steve Cropper you know and love. No soul, or skill for that matter. Horrible, high-schoolish horn arrangements. The titles look tasty but beware. Lotta Help, not Little Help is needed.Spend your money on the Booker T Box Set. Or if you're looking for Cropper satisfaction, get Steve Cropper, Pop Staples and Albert King - Jammed Together... A very great CD. Everything Little Help ain't.Speaking of spending your money - Go out and SEE and HEAR Booker T. The here and now, live and luscious."
5,The Best Escape From today's woes,I am rereading this book for the third time and now realise why - it is a great way to escape today's world and relive a time which will never be repeated when plains mountains and valleys were mysterious places full of adventure because they were totally unknown uncharted and uninhabited. The wold has changed to the extent that we seldom enjoy our natural environment and are locked into the digital revolution with all its quick fixes. This book is a great description of what life was like at that time and is a classic.
4,FOR SALT WATER LOVERS ONLY,"FOR HISTORY AND EARLY LIFE SAILOR LOVERS THIS IS A MUST. Relatively slow reading to grasp each word and the deepset meaning of life in past years. an extrA treat is the fascinating depiction of the Caifornia coastunder the early Mexican flag.Hard to put down -- each chapter posed a new scene and challenge unto itself,highly recommended."
3,"It was only Ok, to me","This book was ok. The author talked about her abuse and how she stayed with the abuser, husband for some time before she actually left him for good. However, the book was kind of redundant and she repeated the same thing over and over. I was waiting for the book to develop over each chapter but each chapter seemed to just repeat what she had already said. Maybe, it was just me, but it was not all that good to me."
2,Big dissapointment for various reasons,"First of all it is simply a re-branded SafeNet SoftRemote client I have used with Watchguard and other hardware vendors for over 10 years. The client comes with no presets or Netgear specific advantages. It is just as tedious to setup as any other client including free ones like TheGreenBow and Shrew. It does not work with Vista 64bit. I see no reason why this client which has been around for MANY years should be an added cost, or why there is not a Netgear specific client that could work with Netgear hardware. In any event, not a happy camper. To be fair I will say that if and when you get it connected it is a solid client- and also that I have never had it crash on me."
4,a new fan,"Found these guys while searching some other band, I like how Amazon shows artists who are similar and what other customers are looking at in relation to their original search. I have discovered many new bands (to me) this way, and have gotten out of my old school rocker rut! Iron Savior fits the category I prefer in heavy metal. The fast songs are about the max I can handle, but the vocals aren't growled, he actually sings so it's cool. The first few songs on this disk are what I prefer in my metal, up tempo, not super fast-listenable. Good song structure, tight rhythm, guitar driven. That's the key for me, guitar driven metal, not hairband stuff, good European style, slightly neo-classical. There is a cover of Desert Plains by Judas Priest that is possibly better than the original. If you like classic style metal, you will like this release."
4,Pretty good,"The sentences in the book might seem complex in the beginning. The author seems to want to convey as much information in one sentence. But once you get used to his style of writing, you will gather all the information you would ever need."
2,Excessive Technobabble,It seemed to me that the author was trying to prove to the world how smart he was. He never gets to the point. He uses a lot of big words and ends up obfuscating the point. The book should be written to teach important concepts vice showing how large the author's vocabulary is on the subject. The old adage KISS (Keep it simple stupid!)
3,Decent stories starving for an editor!,"The editing is so lax that the editor, Nick Street's name appears on the spine as Nick Stret. Multiple spelling errors, run-on sentences, inconsistencies and other signs of amateurism prevail. The plot forms are generally ugly-duckling-finally-redeemed.Nevertheless the originality and honesty of the pieces makes them worth reading."
2,"Cheapest color, but heavily flawed","It is the most affordable color handheld GPS. Unfortunately that is it's only major plus. The world basemap has almost no streets [they should have just provided a more detailed North America]. It's supposed to be a marine-oriented unit, but the lack of nautical waypoints and features is upsetting [it has fewer than my non-chart Garmin 72]. Whole islands are missing here in the Florida Keys, an official channel that has been here for decades with markers is marked private with no details, wrecks are identified as ""partially submerged"" when they are 65 feet below. No tide computation feature [even the Garmin 72 has that]. Pluses are that it updates quickly, has decent battery life, and is relatively easy to use [although it should be simpler -- they took a land-based unit and slapped the ""marine"" title on it]."
3,Perfectly depressing,"The really captivating thing about this movie is not so much the storm, but the fact that this was based on a true story. You keep reminding yourself of that when you watch and that draws you in. How terrifying for those men - to be on that small boat in a hurricane. The characters are well developed in the early part of the movie and you have a ton of compassion for them.The effects are amazing as well. You start to feel rocked by the waves after awhile - it's that powerful."
5,Great movie based on a great book,"All of these people saying that the movie is too long or too boring because of the beginning in the bar and the subplots with the schooner and the coast guard helicopter, I believe it was, have no diea what they are talking. This movie is almost a direct make from the book, they had the bar scenes, the stranded schooner ship, and the helicopter disaster. It was all exactly how it was like in the book. If you read the book, then see this movie, and if you saw this movie and thought there was a lot of drown out stuff, go read the book, because it is an exact adaption of the great book."
3,big wave but book better,"this film is ok there is big big wave but book is better. book has more detale an d more going on. but its a good film if you like action and advantur. so if you like some excitement, see this film. eef you like to read good book, red this book. thankyou"
4,Wonderful presentation in HD DVD,I love this movie and so when i had the chance to get it in HD for dirt cheap i took the time to get it. The HD version is chrisp and clear and the sound is very sharp. Get this movie as it should be a must for anyone who collects HD DVDs :D
2,Perfect Bore,"The 1st part of the movie is too slow. By the time the storm hit, I didn't care if the characters made it or not. The character development was almost non-existent, they could have used cardboard cutouts instead of real actors. The early part of the movie reminded me of Armageddon in the way that it tried to give a glimpse of the characters everyday home life. I feel that both movies failed miserably, with The Perfect Storm being the worse of the two.I would only rate this movie 1 star, except for the very nice 5.1 channel surround sound. If you want a movie to show off your home theatre system, this one will do a good job. However, if you want a good movie to go along with the surround sound try The Matrix, or T2."
5,The Perfect Storm,"This movie was all too real! It kept my heart racing. George Clooney is... Well, amazing. This story rang true on so many levels. Very worthwhile."
2,Perfect Storm,"Since the television previews showed the best parts of The Perfect Storm, You won't have to waste your money buying it like I did. I suggest you rent it instead."
5,A TOTAL CROWD PLEASER.,"Hello all. I just wanted to say what an awesome movie this was. I took the time and went to see it and I have to admit I did not read the book but I saw the film and just sat in my chair and cheered. The special effects are out of this world. Wolfgang Peterson has yet done it again. He is one of the most spectacular filmakers of all. Air Force One was a great one directed by him as well. This movie starts off telling you about the characters and how they set off to their adventure. The movie is excellent. How they show the storms forming and how it combines to form ""The Perfect Storm"". The waves are so well done, and quite a tear-jerker for those who cry a lot. What a movie. I suggest you all have this film on video because I will myself get it when it releases in November. .......... all those people who think it was bad, that it was not even close to the book! This movie is fantastic! Go see it!"
3,DVD Won't Play Whats up?,"I bought this DVD from Amason.com as I do all of my DVD's. I am a loyal customer of Amason, But...When I received this DVD it would not load. I called Amason and great as they are they sent me a new one. Still would not load, Not Amason's problem though. I went and rented the DVD, still would not load. It seems the manufacturer of the DVD is using trick encoding to stop prevent copying. The movie is great, I had to view on VHS though..."
2,The plot is exactly what you imagine it would be.,"Decent visual effects, but the plot is exactly what you feared it would be."
2,"Great Special effects, But....","This movie had really good special effects, as when the waves were hitting the boat. They were bad when it involved the helicopter or the Satori. The character development in this movie was so aweful and the way they portrayed most of the characters was wrong because if you read the book most of the characters were very different such as Chrissy and the mother of Bobby had fights over the mothers boyfriend and that is why she moved out. The other bad point of the movie was the dialogue, there was none. The interaction between the people didn't go. The lines, if you listen closely, didn't go with what the other person even talks about. Released the 30th of June, this movie grossed 182 Million Dollars. This movie will get you addicted if you watch it but watch it a second time and you will see the mistakes in character development and dialogue. My advice Read The Book."
2,Vaguely Interesting,"The special effects and the Coast Guard rescues are the only features of this film worth watching. The characters played by George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are only vaguely interesting. The movie would have been much better if it had centered around the rescue attempts of the Coast Guard. As it is, it rather crawls along and you have to wonder where it's going."
1,Terrible Movie - Anti-climactic,"This movie got so much publicity and such good reviews I was so anxious to see this movie that I purchased a pre-release of the DVD. After receiving it and watching it with my family I was very disappointed in this film. The movie can be summarized as, they go fishing, storms roll in, and they all die. Very little excitement and no heroism. I strongly advise against purchasing this movie. If you are really interested in seeing this movie, I suggest renting it - however, you may also find that renting it is also a waste of money."
1,Perfect Storm Sewer,"..., was this film ..., apart from the big wave. The dialogue was pure rubbish, the acting pure rubbish, a total waste of time. Just fast-forward to the wave, get your kicks and don't waste any of your limited life on this, eh, film. I hated this film so badly I nearly missed watching a good Clooney film, Oh Brother! Where Art Thou?"
2,Incredibly Disappointing,"Critics made this movie out to be the greatest thing in the world. What movie did they see. Some of the scenes were laughable. Mark Whalburg still hasn't convinced me as an actor and George Clooney is just awful. I couldn't relate to any of these characters, I thought the plot was flimsey and they completely wasted Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Did she have significance in this movie other than to fill a female role. This was a very wasted 2 hours."
2,Great effects but poor imitation of Titanic,"Ok, most movies nowadays are special effects, which are great in this case, but this a script about a bunch of mediocre people who drown and nothing else. The only story line discernible is that of the Titanic. Two out of five for the special effects."
2,Waste of Talent and Money!,"Don't see this film. It is a terrible waste of good directing and acting talent. I have never been a Clooney fan, but still...The direction of this film is by the masterful Wolfgang Petersen, one of my favorite directors of all time. He has breathed life into films such as Air Force One and Troy. This film, however, was still dead and not breathing upon release. The music is beautiful. I will not deny that James Horner actually DID hit the nail right on the head, and produced a wonderfull and memorable score, that is my reason for the 2 stars."
2,This film is a storm of its own.,"""The Perfect Storm"" wants to be a blue-collar, modern day ""Titanic"" with its disaster-at-sea plot. Oh, if only it did. Clooney and Wahlberg are wasted talents in this film about a group of fishermen that get caught in a severely powerful storm. To be sure, the storm scenes sound great on DVD; this is a good movie with which to show off your sound system. But the effects, which get redundant after a few minutes, look and feel fake (almost as fake as Diane Lane's Boston accent!). It's as though you're watching not a catastrophe at sea but a video game at a local arcade. Sometimes, digital effects, when overdone as they are here, can strip a film of its realness. Director Wolfgang Peterson probably wanted to give us a reason to care about the story and its characters, but no such luck. ""The Perfect Storm"" is a near-washout."
3,Some improvement,"The product does improve the screen view slightly. In bright sun it is still very difficult to use the view screen. Must admit to being a bit disappointed. It helps, but not as much as I had expected. My big mistake was getting a digital camera with ONLY an LCD screen and no viewfinder. My next camera will not be so limited!"
2,Slightly improved,"'Stonecutter's Story' is better than the previous two 'Swords' books. The plot is more interesting and Saberhagen uses more dialogue to move the story along, but in the end, it's just as pointless as the first two. The good guys will prevail no matter how imposing the opponent."
1,Awful,Inconsistent with many ideas of the original Dune books. Authors didn't even bother to reconcile differences in a believable way. Bad science too!
3,Ok so long as you don't compair it with his father's work,"I love the Dune series and I cut Brian Herbert a LOT of slack in the House series simply because I craved more Dune, but truth be told his story telling is mediocre at best. The complex plans within plans within plans that his father would weave set the bar pretty high and Brian falls short in every single instance. The Butlerian Jihad was an ok story, it was pretty forumlaric and typical of a standard writer, there were few twists and fewer surprises but there was something endearing about the book to me. Perhaps it was always wanting to know the back stories of so many of the important characters of Dune. I hesitantly recommend this book to all but the most zealous Dune fans."
3,So so...,"I originally read this book 4 years ago and decided I would read it again and maybe start on the entire series, however after reading it a second time the last 100 pages or so seemed to drag on for so long...by that point the book was beginning to lose its flavor. It's an okay read but I don't think it's worth the price of $8."
3,Dune: The Butlerian Jihan,"This book is writtin in the spirit of the original Dune series, but it is lacking the profundity and complexity of the original. It is an entertaining read, but I am left wondering if I'd be nearly as engrossed if I wasn't already a fan of the Dune universe. Definitely worth reading, but don't expect to be nearly as challenged as you would be by any of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert himself."
4,Amazing ... for hardcore fans,"Look, I'll make it short. This series isn't a ""classic"" but it is as good, or better, than most of the stuff out there. However, it is very satisfying for hardcore fans like me who always wanted answers to questions like, ""Where did the Bene Gesserit come from?"", ""How did the Guild start?"" and even little things like the invention of the personal shield. The authors do fans like me a great service by providing these, and many many more, answers. You may not like them. You may think that his Old Man would have done it better. But I am thankful that he gave them to us."
5,Could not put it down,"I thought that this was a very well written book. It describes things that are to come in the future. I did not care for the gore, but it was a part of the story to show the cruelty of the machines. I think this story tells a moral story as well. The slavery of the machines coinciding with the slaves kept on the human controlled planets. I can't wait to read the Machine Crusades."
1,Good thing I can trade this thing in&#65533;.,"After I finished this book (which didn't take long) I resolved that this was the LAST one I was ever going to waste my money on. I've put up with these new Dune books, knowing they were mediocre and enjoying them as a guilty pleasure but this one is the last straw. Frank Herbert's characters had intricacies yet they were unknowable, mysterious, but these people in the Butlerian Jihad are a bore; heroes and damsels in distress that are as flat and boring as the paper they are written on. The imagery reeks of concepts lifted straight from Star Wars (AT-ATs anyone?) and plot holes. How could the Guild wield so much power in the future if space travel seemed just as convenient before the Spice? This book should have been a mythological juggernaut, but it's just a pulp bore. And to add insult to injury, not only does it not dish up half of what the book jacket promises but it ends on a cliffhanger so they can sell us more books. No thanks, guys."
2,Brain Candy/Cash Cow,"I found this book entertaining as opposed to the thought provoking work of Frank Herbert. Something I'd like to read on a plane or oil rig.Reads like a Micheal Crichton novel, fast paced, superficial character development and techno backdrop forced into a Dune framework. Like the House trilogy, this had the same prequel formula, parallel character development leading into a dramatic culmination of events at the end with enough (prequel) sequel nuclei scattered throughout. The obligatory philosophical chapter quote sprinkles started getting blase at the last few chapters.Origins of the Evermind and thinking machines reeked too much of Terminator's SkyNet execept SkyNet had more believeble storyline.Reading the book leaves me with the feeling that Herbert and Anderson are going to milk this cash cow for the next 4-5 years.Will I buy the next Legends of Dune? Sure, Dune's an addiction that I can't kick."
2,A good attempt,"Overall this was a page-turner, but it was more like eating McDonald's french fries really fast -- i.e., before they get cold. The characters were a bit ""over-the-top"" and not well developed, except for a few. Judging from their past efforts, I think Herbert & Anderson can do better, but they are likely relying on their own previous success than they are on their skills as writers -- which pale in comparison to Frank Herbert's genius."
1,"If you love Frank Herberts Dune books, DON'T read this.","This book will bore you to tears. Normally I can read a good book in a 2-3 hour sitting. This book took me weeks, because I could only read one chapter at a time. It took so much time, because I could not bring myself to continue reading. I was so disgusted and unhappy with the writing style, the themes, and the characters. I won't mention the incredibly transparent and obvious plot, or should I say lack of plot."
4,Very suprised that I liked it....,"I got a second hand copy and been putting off reading it for about a year, since I had enjoy the Dune original series. Some of the story line was similiar to other Sci Fi themes...like the machines taking over...couldn't help of thinking about the Terminator.But, the rest was impressive so I went ahead and ordered the next one. I enjoyed his style of writing and the story was interesting and paced well."
2,It's just plain lacking.,"This book could have been so much more. The subject matter is so rich with possibilities that it should have taken up a trilogy in and of itself. It takes a lot of time introducing characters. I liked the idea of the characters, but found they weren't very well developed- they felt one-dimensional, as if they were only there to hold up the plot line, or satisfy a reference made in a later book.The authors lay out this whole grand plot line of the butlerian jihad, and just when it starts to get interesting they wrap it up. The whole last quarter of the book feels like strung together a bunch of vignettes. It leaves you very dis-satisfied.Disappointing, lacking, ...ugh! I don't have the right words for this. I wanted so much more."
5,SMOKIN'....,"Highly recommend everyone out there to check Canadian Recording Artist ""Bobby Cameron"". He has three Indy CD's released to date. His latest, Emotional Drift, is awesome. Full of great roots and blues numbers that he recorded with a stellar line up in Nashville. Legendary producer, Miles Wilkinson, recorded the project and it sounds wicked. I caught Bobby Cameron live in Toronto, Canada, a few times and he blew me away. He takes the stage with so much enthusiasm and performs like his life depends on it. In my Books, Bobby Cameron is in the same league as my Hero Bruce Springsteen. I think if Bruce caught Bobby Live he would say, ""When I pass the torch on, Bobby Cameron will receive it"". Anybody that wants to get a piece of ""Rocking Roll's future"" should without question buy all three CD's of Bobby Cameron. His website is amazing too... www.bobbycameron.com.Keep rocking Bobby, we love in Toronto....."
2,Not happy,"For 4 months already I doing what the author explained in the book. I think I should stop because, first of all I did not gained any height, and now I see that it was written by the guy who goes not know much about all this. Now I understand that the book does not have to be larger and nicer to be more usefull."
2,HARD TO READ,I was quite intrigued by the title and started reading with enthusiasm. After about 6 chapters I added this to my 'dislike' file. I have no idea what the story is about and have no intention of trying to find out - I n my opinion it is a difficult book to read.
2,Out of date version,"The product I recieved from Amazon was a very outdated version. It was approximately two to three years old. The version was so old I was not able to get an upgrade to a version that works with Vista. Fortunately, I found a very nice representative at NETGEAR that sent me a link to an upgrade. DO NOT PURCHASE UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THAT AMAZON HAS THE LATEST VERSION!!"
4,Got the tape but the book gives you more detail.,"I loved hearing Marilu explaining the different steps of her program, especially the dairy portion. I gave up milk after I heard her describe what it does to you and what's in it! For those not familiar with the program, while the tape has lots of information, I feel her books really give you the extra details you need to follow the program."
5,Will change your life--if you are ready,"The reason I like this book so much is that it is about getting healthy--not getting thin. You may not agree with everything she says, but if you are willing to try some of the steps, you will feel and look better than you ever have in your life. The weight loss follows the healthy living. The book itself could be written a little better, but she seems to have done her homework. Don't try to do all the steps at once, this is about making over your life, which of course does not happen overnight. This is a refreshing break from the high protein, low carb fad."
2,"Bought it, took it back.","All the steps listed in her book are based on common sense, and your ability to cut some foods completely out of your diet. I also noticed that in the limited number of recipies in the back that everything was organic. I live in Colorado where food is expensive to begin with, and orgnic is VERY expensive. I want a plan that I can follow, where I'm not already at a disatvantage."
3,"Good advice, should be applied to suit your needs","My husband snickered when he caught me reading this book. He's the type who doesn't believe ""celebrities"" should be offering health advice. I showed him the back cover and said I wanted to know how Marilu got to look so good, so I could at least have a fighting chance.I haven't followed everything to the letter in this book, but I did give up dairy and caffeine and started a steady exercise program, and used some principles from Weight Watchers. I dropped 35 pounds!I suppose the key is reading this book and manipulating the suggestions so it suits your needs. Not everyone has the same body, so not everyone should use an identical program. What worked for Marilu might not have worked for me. Improvise."
3,I,"I was interested in the first half of the book, but lost interest after that. I also got the impression that Marilu is on an ego trip. If combining foods is so important why was there not a more detailed chapter on this technique? I also felt that some of her statements were not backed by scientific proof. This diet doesn't seem realistic to me."
3,Outdated,"The CD is good, but unfortunately, it was created in 2001. There is no updated version and most of the information on the 2011 MCAT has been changed. I used the Audio CD with full confidence listening to it everyday, unfortunately, I later looked at the AAMC MCAT Content Outline and realized that the Examkrackers Audio Osmosis CD left out A LOT of things. The organic chemistry section for example is missing a lot of important reactions. It has put me behind schedule on studying and taken away my confidence. It must be noted that one or two tracks have small mistakes, but this should not impact your overall learning at all. The jokes and stories used are sometimes just a waste of time, and do not facilitate any learning. Overall, there MUST be an update to the audio CD otherwise it is only good for reviewing SOME topics."
3,"A good idea, but...","The audio osmosis concept is good. It is a great way to study for the MCAT, I also like the way this series focuses on WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW for the MCAT. Unfortunately, the jokes are often dumb and annoying and occasionally sexist and offensive. The authors clearly pander to the frat boy mentality, and don't seem to think that any women would actually be interested in medical school."
3,it's ok..,im pretty blah about it...it's good and it's bad...it's right in the middle of being just a ok product from examkrackers....you'd spend better time reading their awesome review notes and practicing your tests...
5,Great for on the go studying,"Great investment.Audio Osmosis is great for reviewing what you have been studying. I would not encourage someone to only use this product for mcat prep, rather it is only good if you use this product with other materials. I am in a prep course and I like how this audio product will bring up topics about what I had just studied intensly on paper. Its another way of retaining the information.Plus I wont feel guilty if I take time off studying and go for a road trip while listening to Jordan & Jon. Both of these guys are complete clowns who provide you with helpful MCAT info, tips and confidence."
1,Worst movie ever.,"I try to support African American movies but when they put out garbage like this I have to let my displeasure be known. The plot was stupid and there was absolutely no chemistry whatsover between the main characters. Even the attempts at comedy were horrible. There was nothing about the characters that made you want to invest in the characters or the storyline. I just wanted the movie to be over with because I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me find some redeemable factor in this movie but nothing. Bad actors, bad acting, bad directing, and terrible writing."
2,"By and large, a waste of time.","The beginning is very well done, then the only interesting parts are the cat-and-mouse between Jude Law and Ed Harris. The rest of the film is bad, I'd say. Luckily, I recorded it from TV. It is now erased. (By the way, one of the Amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that Bob Hoskins is American. He's from England.)"
1,What a shame,"I was very disappointed with the movie ""Enemy at the Gates."" I believe my disappointment is based on the fact that I enjoyed the book very much, and the way the producer/director chose to change charater motivations in the movie ruined a very well-written story.I am often disappointed when a book I thoroughly enjoy is made into a movie; I have once more learned my lesson and will leave movie watching to those who lack good reading abilities"
3,Pretty good,"Okay, I really like Enemy at the Gates, because I love history (especially wars) and I am a HUGE Ed Harris fan.Uncommon Valor bored me, which is the only reason I rated this product 3 stars out of 5."
4,Great movie.,"This DVD is beautiful. The picture, the sound, the clarity. The movie is something that I find interesting. It's about the only movie based on the Eastern Front of WWII. It deals with a true story. It is basically a sniper movie, but it's a war movie at heart.So what makes this movie so good? A combination of things. First off, the acting is excellent. All the way from the up-and-coming Jude Law to the very underrated Ed Harris. Second, the image the movie puts in your head of what war is like is second only to Saving Private Ryan. There are many more reasons to get this DVD.Okay, enough of all these compliments. Now the complaints. About my only complaint is the love story. I'm not a big fan of love stories in war movies. But, this one seems to pull it off pretty good.So, if you want a good movie, get this."
1,"Even if you LURVE Jude Law, Don't Buy This Movie!",It is just bad. Really really bad. I bought it only because1. It was under $5.00and2. My 65 year old father asked for it.Enough said.
4,"Very Good, I would give it 4.5 Stars","Enemy at the Gates is a very good movie. It is very graphic, and the ending quite frankly suprised me. Some of the special effects leave something to be desired, that is one reason that I could not give it 5 stars, particularly when they are crossing the Volga and the Stukas attacked. It looked pretty fake. When they get into the City and they are bombed, the special effects improved. Also my only other major complaint is that all of the actors spoke with English accents. I love English Accents, and the actors and actresses are great, so that balances the Accent Problem. I would definitely recommend this movie to any WWII fan, or any fan of War movies, which I am not, I hate war and this movie helps me appreciate the sacrifices that people make in times of it."
3,Enemy at the Gates,"Bought this because I caught the very end of it on late night TV one night and it looked great. I have to agree with the critics though, the love story detracts from what could have been an awesome movie."
2,Too much hollywood,"The name of this movie comes from the non-fiction book by the same name about the battle of Stalingrad which devotes only a couple of pages to Zaitsev and his feats. The movie actually follows more closely the novel, War of the Rats, by David L. Robbins. The novel is excellent and the start of the movie was such that I though we finally had a movie that was going to follow the book. But, alas, that was not to be. After the initial scenes it became the typical Hollywoodized war flick that mangled the book from which it was adapted. Some of the people were there but were it not for their names I'd have not known who they were supposed to be.If you're looking for a war movie with some impressive sets then you'll enjoy it but if you're looking to learn anything about the true battle of Stalingrad, forget it. This movie is at best worth the price of an evening's rental. That's how I first saw it and in my opinion it's worth no more than that and certainly isn't worth purchasing."
2,Disappointing,"The problem with this movie is that historical inaccuracies. If one is to make a movie based upon an actual event, it really should try to stick to what really happened. To make matters worse, great actors were stuck into bad parts and they seemed to just sleep-walk through the thing. Plus, Jude Law does a terrible Russian accent, when he even tries. Just a waste of time AND money."
3,An average film,This film while done very well and acted admirably lacks any spark between the two sharp shooters. You never feel like they are really that big of enemies. The whole part with them loving the girl was just Hollywood rearing its ugly head. That was totally unecessary and stupid. She had no place in the movie.
1,Has not held up,"Now that I've had this bag for a year, I will tell you that it has not held up. The leather is cheap and it looks terrible. I'm throwing it away."
3,Long on Nut's & Bolts short on easy to read specifics.,"Bought the book hoping it would assist me in re-counstructing wiring on the 1st Gen (specifically 67 RS)I was/am greatly dissapointed. It shows and lists things like ""nut's,screws, washers etc... but miserably fails to provide easy to read schematics (color codes,relays,breakers and mountings) of such difficult areas as headlights and engine compartment looms."
3,"Review of ""Now You Know Treo""","I was disappointed. I expected it to be more of a ""how to"" book instead it seemed to be selling the worth of the Treo. Telling how great it is and what it will do, especially if additional applications are installed on it. ~ acr"
1,"If you loved the original TV series, do NOT buy these movies.","We watched every episode of the Christy TV Series in a two week span, and were so in love with the series that I rushed out and got the 3 made-for-TV movies to continue the story.We honestly could not even finish watching them. Viewed next to the original series, the ""new"" ones are painful to watch. Even my 8 year old daughter said the movies were horrible.So sad, because we thought the Christy TV series was one of the best things we had seen recently."
3,So-so,"Of the three new Christy movies, this is the weakest one. Only the characters of Neil, Fairlight, and Harriet are very good. The rest of the acting isn't very convincing. But if you are a fan of the old series, it answers some questions left open at the end of the series."
1,Christy - Return to Cutter Gap,"As I had watched the original series, the differences were very apparent in the change of actors, location and characters and even the theme of the story. It would have been nicer to have had the ending of the original series as the flow wasn't good. I was very disappointed with their new take on the original series."
5,Satisfying series,"These three Christy movies provide a satisfacory conclusion to the story of Christy. The television series starring Kellie Martin was superb--but left you with a cliffhanger when the whole series ended! Who did she marry? As I remember the filming details of this series, the ending was filmed both ways--and even the cast did not know the ending to the story until the final product was finished! Would have been interesting if they had provided the alternate ending as ""deleted scenes"" so that everyone could be happy! Some original actors were brought over from the television series, which gave some sense of continuity--but the main actors (except for Neil) were all different and the setting was different. But that is just the way of television. Enjoy!"
2,It's ok but it's nothing special!,I liked the TV show and was disappointed when Pax stopped showing the episodes and was so happy when I read that they were making new movies and I really looked forward to watching them and I tried to watch them but sorry to say that I just couldn't get into this or the other movies and was bored and I thought it was just adequate but nothing special!
3,Just Okay,"This book is very comprehensive, but it is written in a strange folksy text that I found to be less than helpful. Overall the templates and such are nice, but it would have been very helpful if the book came with the various templates in electronic form.This book is certainly not for non-lawyers. I am a practicing attorney and found it somewhat helpful, but certainly overpriced."
3,Not only for Californians,"This book sits on my book shelf right next to the standard english work on the subject (Nigel Joseph Ley's Drink Driving Law and Practice). The advantage of Kuwatch's work for experts and advocates who appear in the English (and Scottish) courts is that he deals with issues that are only just coming before the Courts across the pond, such as Drug Recognition Experts and field Sobriety tests. If you are from outwith California, buy the book (I did), ignore the law and cherish the science and the commentary."
4,"Out of Print, But Worth The Search!","Black Top Records has a string of top quality recordings that have gone out of print including recordings by Chris Thomas King, Earl King, Henry Butler, Guitar Shorty and this one by Hubert Sumlin. ""Healing Feeling"" features Sumlin and Ronnie Earl on guitar, Darrell Nulisch on vocals and harmonica, Dickie Reed on Organ, Per Hanson on drums and James Davis on vocals. The songs are mostly originals with a couple of covers sprinkled about for a little added flavor. With the sax of Kaz Kazanoff backing up Nulish's vocals and Earl's guitar, the band has an unmistakable ""Roomful of Blues"" feeling and tightness. There is some really good music on this disc and it is worth seeking out. Stand out tracks include Freddy King's ""Play It Cool"" and Ronnie Earl's ""Healing Feeling""."
3,disappointed,"This album is not what I expected. There are too many unpleasant vocals. Could just be my taste, but not what I was looking for."
3,Enjoyable pass-the-time kind of book,"I enjoyed reading this book about the author. Good humor. Notes to myself: brush up on vocabulary.He blends his personal typical teenage experiences with his search for wisdom. The book is broken in small titles going back and forth from what he's learned from books and the personal experiences he encounters. It's easy to pick up and put down as time permits because of this. The ending was a bit of a disappointment. But then again, the book was just what his title said it was....field notes, not a thorough autobiography. His conclusion was weak."
2,functional but aggrevating,"These work to charge your phone, but the casing around part that plugs into the phone is slightly wide, causing the plug to fall out of the phone easily. This is especially aggravating with the car charger. I think it's worth the money to get the better fitting items from Samsung.Also - why does Samsung change the plug in each phone model? The BlackJack 1 and Blackjack 2 do not use interchangeable plugs and my wife's Samsung flipphone uses a completely different connection. Are they trying to make money on peripherals and chargers?"
5,SOUL FOLK IN ACTION - STAPLE SINGERS CD,"Yes... it's an oldie but now available on CD and a worthy release. My favourite track is definitely ""I see It"" but good to have back in my collection after having my original vinyl album stolen. Wonderful harmonies from a tremendous soul family."
1,Don't Bother,"Although this book seems like a good idea in principle, it is unfortunatly a waste of time and money. The writing style is hard to follow and rather boring. The details and tips you would hope to find in a book such as this are not readily available. Overall, if you are looking for a book to help you start up a wedding consulting business, then you should probably look elsewhere."
4,Not a Kid's CD!,"Although most of u might think that the That's So Raven soundtrack is for little kiddies aged 7-10, ur wrong. I'm 13, and i enjoy this CD. it includes Jesse McCartney's Beautiful Soul, Lindsay Lohan's Ultimate, Raven's Supernatural, Stacie Orrico's (There's Gotta Be) More to Life, and lots more! this cd will get your foot to start tapping and getting u to listen to it over and over again!"
3,Only okay.,"The tracks sung by Raven are great, the soundtrack would be better if there were more by Raven. Some songs don't even relate to the show, and basically dont even suit the show, such as beautiful soul, superstar, i'm every woman, more to life e.t.c. This is a soundtrack to a children's series, not a dance movie, or an rnb album. I would have liked some more 'disney' like songs."

5,Great!,I read this book a year ago and I was 13 years old. I thought that It was a very good book. It was interesting and it was about real people. It changed my views on slavery.
4,A Somewhat Good Book,"Roots was a book about a couple Omoro and Binta who have a baby boy named Kunta. However, Kunta is kidnapped by whites and he becomes a slave. His master is very nice to him by not using the whip on him and he gives him the name Toby when he arrives. Later on he marrys Bell a cook and they have a daughter named Kizzy. However, Kizzy is put in jail for writing a fake pass for her loved one.My grandfather thought I should read this book, because he thought I would like it. When I first looked at it I didn't think I could read all of it and it would be boring. Then as I started reading the book I got more interested. I even stayed up late to finish the book.My favorite part is when Kunta is on the ship going to America. I felt so sad and couldn't believe someone would do such a thing.I felt so sorry for his mother and father. Also I would really recommend this book to others."
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is amazing I think it should be a requirement to read this book in schools. Something we can all relate to.After reading this book I would definitely recommend reading other Alex Haley novels like Queen and Mama Flora's Family.I love this book!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy this DVD,I can't believe I fell for this one! I have not bought a bad thing on Amazon but I really got taken this time! I can't believe I paid the money I did for this DVD and frankly I am disappointed in Amazon for selling it! Please listen to me and do not waste your money. I was a fool for doing so!
1,WOW...in a bad way!!,"This is one of the really bad videos that are currently out there since the passing of our beloved MJ. Take my word for it, it's absolute JUNK. First clue to a crappy MJ video is when Sony has nothing to do with it and MJ's music is not on it anywhere(they have to reveal that!) Please....don't waste your time or money on this...i'll send you mine for free!!!!"
1,A Bonafide Turkey,"Don't waste your money on this yawner! I'm a hard-core Michael Jackson fan and collect all the film footage of him that I can. But man, did I make a mistake when I ordered ""Never Surrender"". Its 70-minute running time seems like 170 by the time you reach its merciful end. No music, just people I've never heard of telling their stories about Michael. Yes, some of these people worked closely with MJ, but the narrative format is a total bore. The DVD's only redeeming feature is that it has interspaced rare clips of MJ, but even so, it isn't worth the first dollar. I'm embarrassed to even have it in my collection!"
3,Live proof that Albert King's blues guitar voice is unique.,"This album is typically overlooked by blues fans, even Albert fans, but it's a note-perfect document of how to deliver a live blues performance. Albert has such total control of the blues guitar vernacular unique to him that he can ply a range of emotions through a subtlety of pitch, dynamics, and timing that is probably unmatched. The uninitiated listener mistakes this control for repetitiveness, but the flawlessness of Albert's delivery makes his blues guitar voice undeniably compelling nonetheless. All the evidence is on this record."
3,Wish that Quality Control was Better,"First:The box that the Raclette came in was heavily damaged, making it horrible for gift giving! I ended up having to use the Amazon outer box instead.Second:One of the serving pans handles was broken, not really sure how to get a replacement.Finally:The machine itself really works well. It's just a shame that quality control(during packing & shipping) wasn't better."
2,repetitive,"Although I am a fan of this book genre I must admit this was a disappointing read. There is a lack of interesting characters, dialog, and situations. Other than a repetitive string of descriptions where everything is just absolutely super perfect, there is not much there."
1,For travelers only,"If you are looking for a book to help translate actual slovak, look some where else. This book is very limited. If you need a book to take with you with a variety of spoken phrases this is your book."
4,great yet not a great book for beginners.,"i have had gone through most of this book and this is my opinion.it is not the greatest amount of help if you dont already know some slovak.this book is very limited,so if you purchase this book you should also get a book to help you with grammar.they are cheap,12-30 dollars.if you also purchase ""Slovak-English, English-Slovak Dictionary & Phrasebook by Sylvia Lorinc and John M. Lorinc"" then go ahead and buy this one too.the other book will explain briefly about grammar and also has phrases you can use in most situations."
2,Don't be fooled! This is a B-Movie!,This was a Stupid excuse for a Real Western. I can't believe I fell for it :(The plot was soooo slow we fell asleep and had to continue later to see the end which by the way WAS the best part so if you do buy it watch the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes and then you have just SAVED 1 whole hour of your life and that is all you will need to see of this movie!@
1,Dismal,"We actually like westerns, and Harvey Keitel (despite his apparent contract requirement that he have a scene involving his nude bum written into every film in which he appears), and David Bowie (who seems to choose films primarily based on costuming). Beyond that, we also even like cheesy, B-grade movies, which are often at least good for a laugh. We sat down to watch this one with the expectation that it would either be good, and we'd like it, or it'd be bad, and we'd laugh at it. We were wrong. It was so bad we couldn't even finish it. We wanted to. We tried. It's so poorly written, badly dubbed, appallingly acted, haltingly paced, and generally dismal, that we couldn't plow through. I'm almost tempted to show it to friends as an example of one of the worst films I've ever seen, but it's really just not entertaining enough even as kitsch."
3,One good WrestleMania,The WrestleMaina featuring Hogan vs Slaughter as the main even is probably the greatest WrestleMaina out there. Alot of good matches but the rest of the set is lackluster. It was a dark period for WWE in 92 and 93 and the WrestleMaina's will show that. Yoko VS Bret in 93 and 94 were good main events but the endings were stupid.
2,Mediocre at best,"Christopher Stasheff is an author who's works I usually enjoy reading. Unfortunately, ""A Wizard and a Warlord"" was a rather disappointing read for me. The story was rather mediocre at best, and I found it difficult to really care about the story or what was happening to the characters. Not really much else to say about this book; I can only recommend that fans of the author should skip over this book and read one of his other more enjoyable works."
1,Bad Dog. No Biscuit.,"A book that might have been enjoyable was ruined by the constant right-wing slurs against the policies of Democratic presidents. The partisan rhetoric was ill-informed and certainly overused in the book. Not only were many of the statements grossly exaggerated and incorrect, they disrupted the flow of the story.Perhaps these rantings were added to disguise some of the predictable turns in the plot. Patrick you are a Bad Dog."
2,Poorly Written For Robinson,This book has a very good idea from the conceptual standpoint. The trouble is the good part of the book is only 50 pages long. I kept trying to figure out how the author was going to cram all that was needed into the few pages remaining and of course he couldn't. Why he spent the first 300 plus pages developing a character is beyond me. He could have done it in the first fifty pages and left the rest for good stuff. If you enjoy Kilo Class and USS Seawolf you will not enjoy this one. If you must read it wait for the paperback or go to the library. Now if you want great submarine books try Michael DiMercurio as no one does a better job under water.
1,Ugh!,"So, Robinson spends almost the entire first third of this book following the bad guy around from birth, who is admittedly an interesting character, and then mostly discards this character for the rest of the book. Did I mention that there really is no ""hero""? Nope, once the bad guy melts into the background, the rest of this ponderous tome ""focuses"" on how sneaky submarines are, a preposterous pseudo-Academy Awards sequence, and the evils of Bill Clinton. The ending? Something big is blown up and there are absolutely no repercussions. What started out for me as an intersting delve into a genre of fiction I had little previous experience with turned into a surreal, delusional political rant I have no interest in returning to."
3,Mental junk food.,"It's not a great book, nor really very good, but its fun to read and hard to put down."
3,"SI QUIERES LLORAR, LLORAR","ME PARECE ESTUPENDA, SOBRE TODO PORQUE LA OI EN COSTA RICA COMO SI ESTUVIERA EN MI LUNA DE MIEL"
4,Put the stickers on before you build the track :),"We got this (I mean ""Santa"" got this) for my 2 year old son for Christmas. He played with it all day the first day...I read many reviews for it and knew to stick the decals/stickers on BEFORE assembling the track pieces. It was still very difficult to get the pieces lined up perfectly, but I like stupid challenges like that lol. Anyhow, he enjoys it immensely and I can see that it will be used for a long time to come. :)"
4,Great Toy for Everyone!,We just bought this table for our two year-old son who actually will not be two until March but we ordered it early and Daddy couldn't wait to build it it so we gave it to him early :)He loves it and will scoot around the table playing with it for a long time. Even his 7 year-old sister plays with it. Our favorite part is that it has a lot of tunnels and slides to make it more interesting!
5,Michelle L.,Great product. Durable and easy to use. Kids love it. Also good for storage of trains/cars.
5,Twins Love It,My 2 year old twin grands--boy and girl love this set. Make sure you put the decals on before attaching the bridges.
5,Years of enjoyment,"We bought this table because our nephew in NY has a similar table, and our son did not stop using it for an entire visit one time. We got him this one for our house as his ""big brother gift"" when our daughter was born over a year ago, and he has used it nearly every day since. We love the versitiity of this table because it fits all types of cars and trains perfectly. The Take Along/Take and Play Thomas trains are the perfect size for this table. It is a much cheaper and versatile alternative to the expensive wooden Thomas sets."
5,My son's FAVORITE toy!,"This table is my son's favorite toy, by far. He's had it since he was about 21 months old, and he plays with it every single day, even now 6 months later. Even my 7 month old likes to sit with my 2 year old and ""play"" with it. Every kind of car and train can fit on it, and it doubles as a ""coffee table"" with the lid on. Best purchase we've made. I highly recommend this table. It's a huge hit at our house."
4,Love it. Great value!,"I have two boys, one who is two and the other is almost four. They had a set of tracks, but I had to put them up out of reach because they would always fight over them. With this table, they can both play, and the fighting is very much reduced. The table is sturdy and durable, and the boys love sending the trains down the ""slides"". Definitely worth the price!"
5,BOYS LOVED IT AND GETTING YEARS OF FUN!,"Bought this for my twin boys at 18 months for their 2nd xmas, they loved it then and at three years of age its still getting lots and lots of use.Use the table to eat breakfast, arts and crafts, ppalydough, reading - EVERYTHING! They use the rail and raod track daily too! It is still in excellent condition despite taking a battering from the boyds. They will outgrow this before it breaks - excellent quality!!"
3,Love /Hate ?! Expected more I guess.,"The table itself is sturdy and colorful, however it arrived with a cracked corner on it's white table top & the Step 2 logo stuck upside down & in the wrong spot! Can't ship it all back for that, my kid has already seen it! (I've pulled the logo off & replaced right side up, scraped the industrial double stick tape off the side of the table & painted the whole top with chalkboard paint...)I agree with the other reviews in that the stickers have some gaps between them (and yes, I did apply them correctly) that means the rail tracks and roads have major gaps - as a detail oriented person this really rubs me the wrong way.I know it sounds like I hate it, but I don't: I really do love the fact that there's no moving track pieces/parts to come apart or lose. I love that my two year old love, love, LOVES IT! and I'm quite sure we'll get hours and hours of fun out of it.I guess all in all, as a frequent buyer of their products, I just expected more from Step 2."
2,Outdated book! Misleading title!,"I bought this book because it is said to be the best on the subject. After having read the book i can only give you the advice not to read this book if you want hints and tricks to improve on your reading skills. This book was born in 1940 - and it shows. They tell you to read the new testament! However, the release dat can also be positive. It's a rich, logical and very formal language. You won't find so much perfection in a book nowadays.The authors EXPALAIN HOW A BOOK IS STRUCTURED AND HOW IT WAS WRITTEN, but they don't give you much hints, which would help you. They just say: Read carefully, read slowly, compare the books to other books. But hey, don't YOU know that? They explain WHAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOOKS EXIST - but: who cares! I want to know ""how to read a book"" and nothing else!I read the book completly, but it was not an enjoyment for me."
1,"Seriously, stay away.","This book is made to show people how to dive into the higher levels of reading, specifically it aims at collegiate reading. However, there is a huge paradox tied up with this book. If you don't know how to read at a higher level, you won't get anything out of this book because you won't be able to connect with a lot of the information presented. If you do read well (and by this, i mean are not a complete moron) then this book is a huge waste of time and you will really learn nothing. The best thing I learned from this book offered another paradox. It says to learn to recognize books that are not worth your time and effort and do not give them that effort. Because of that, I am able to tell you all to not give this book a second of your life. PLEASE."
4,Excellent treatise on literary analysis and criticism,"On one hand, it feels weird to read a book about how to read a book. So very meta. Yet I came away from this tome with a lot of insight into the difference between widely read and well-read.There are salient points (and useful advice) on finding themes and reading with an analytical mind. I really wish I would've been able to read this book before I went to university.Even the advice on reading novels for entertainment, while probably common sense to many, is useful. In addition, there is a (rather intimidating) reading list at the end.So, overall, a must-read. Only four stars, though, because at time the text can be a little dry and turns into a struggle."
2,How to lose ten dollars and up to an hour of your time,"I figure that one reads books for knowledge and/or enjoyment, and ""How to read a book"" has little to offer in either regard. It is a thoughtful and eloquent book, but, in my opinion, practical advice found in it could fit on a couple of small pages, and should not be new. (In essence, the advice is: ""It makes sense to read a book in more than one pass, scanning/skimming at first"", and ""Do not read passively, but think about what you read, engage with the author's ideas""). Speaking of enjoyment, one may like the old-fashioned writing style, but surely can find it elsewhere for free - you might as well read, say, Hume or Darwin. Whatever your hopes for this investment of your money and time are, you would do better by looking elsewhere."
5,Some People are being Too Hard on This Book- It's a Very Useful Book,"I read this book in HS, many years ago, having discovered it on my own. It was very helpful. It made me realize that it was OK to re-read texts,and that I wasn't mentally slow, if I didn't get all the meaning on my first reading. It gave me an overview of reading, and was much superior to what I was getting in HS English classes, which focused only on grammar.I recommend this book to people, in particular, who want to improve their reading comprehension, and writing skills. Let Dr. Adler be your tutor. He was the editor of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and the editor of the Great Books, pub by the U. of Chicago. He wrote during a time when education itself was valued, not just education to pass tests or get a good job. This book could help you build a solid foundation in reading comprehension."
3,Recommended,"Haven't finished reading. Though highly recommended, I'm having a hard time reading. Too difficult long for me. Maybe I need to start over."
2,Weak,I just got these stands for my onkyo S5100 HTIB system. I researched a lot and these stands claimed they could hold up to 8 lbs. The speakers that came with my system are around 6 lbs. The stands barely stay upright. And there's no way to extend the hight because the locking mechanism is too weak to hold up the speakers. These might be a great choice for really little light speakers but not for anything more than 4 lbs. (my guess).
4,Human vs. machine,"In response to ""Doc's"" review: how can anyone say you cannot understand Shakespeare if you haven't read this book? How silly! Do you not get that Shakespeare is timeless? Shakespeare's play are not documentaries. And this idea to label him ""conservative"" is silly and irrelevant. Shakespeare's work still lives because it speaks to something human that transcends world views, politics, and years. These are relationships playing out their lives in the imagination of an artist, not elitist agendas that normal people with active imaginations may or may not understand."
3,These songs are not written in the Civil War period,"The price is great, the audio quality is good and the words in the songs are inspiring. There's one glitch, however. These are not original songs composed and written by people who witnessed the Civil War, but are modern ones composed in the 20th century, thus losing most of the aesthetic value that one usually derives from the historical authenticity."
5,A Very Interesting Book,"I found this book in the mark down bin at the local books store and am so glad I brought it home. Dr. Leman touches on how birth order, early childhood memories and even your parents' style of parenting affects the development of your personality. This book provides lots of insight on things I never even thought about before. Also, his writing style is a pleasure to read, as he uses personal anecdotes to illustrate his points."
4,Love is Drama,"This was a very good film, it didn't show a lot of graphic scenes, but you could feel the love tension between Sonia and Kabir. I personally liked the Indian music that Sonia sang through the movie, it was different hearing music in a foreign language. Kabir is so fine."
3,spoof that isn't funny,"this could be enjoyable i guess. but if you've seen ""body heat"" and those movies by mickey rourke (9 1/2 weeks series) then you practically have seen this, seriously..."
5,Good things come to all who wait,"This is a story thaT a lot of us can learn from, I've often heard the expression""If you love something, set it free, it will come back if it was meant to be."", this is true in this story, also it shows the depth and width some men will go through to satisfy the one's that they love, however, we have to always do the right thing in order for us to accomplish whatever it is we are trying to do, also ""Family"", plays an important part in all of our lives, the family that ""Prays together, Stays together"". This was captured and accomplishe in ""A SECOND CHANE AT LOVE"". It captured and held you attention from the beginning to the end."
4,Retro love,"I read all the Happy Hollister books when I was a child, and my 9 year old just finished reading this one. She enjoyed it just as much as I used to!"
5,Great read-aloud book!,"Fun, simpler times story reminiscent of Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys. Great for before-bed read-aloud with 7 or 8 yr olds. My son really enjoyed this book! Adventurous, bravery, but not scary."
5,It is so easy to get totally wrapped up in an of these books,"I have read most of these books which my mom gave to me. Even though I am 14 and these are a nice break from the heavy reading which I have to do. I enjoy every one thoroughly. The mystery and suspense is great and the plots are very creative. Sometimes the goody-goodieness of the kids makes me sick, but thats all part of the fun of it."
1,BROKE SHORTLY AFTER WARRANTY,How cliché for a product to break shortly after the warranty period. Well that is what you have here with the Robomower. Of course the cost to ship and fix the mower is quite expensive. When I purchased this product the Friendly Robotics went on and on about how good it was. Well let me tell you that this is not the case. The product is not even close to worth what it costs. I am going to stick with conventional gas mowers from now on. We all need to protect ourselves from products that are costly with short warranty periods.
3,Latin is no longer a spoken language!,"This is not a review of this book, but a response to those grousing about the quality of the tape provided with the text. As was repeatedly explained to me in my two undergraduate years in Latin courses, Latin as spoken (aside from ecclesiastical Latin) is a dead language. Debates range on as to how it actually sounded in daily use. My point? It's not a language to learn for conversation, but for literary translation. If you're looking for a conversational language, learn one that's still being spoken in the world today: French, Spanish, Italian, etc. If you want to translate Classical texts, then learn Latin, and don't worry over your pronunciation. It really doesn't matter if it's spot-on or not!"
3,Wasn't what I expected,"Though an avid appreciation for the female form and lover of fine art, I was expecting more of a collection of drawings on this. What I got was a sketchpad of various drawings and works of females in different styles. Not bad in the sense but dissapointing. Though this guy Cho can draw his you-know-what off it was entirely in black and white."
5,Street Smarts: Market Proven,"Street Smarts is the perfect title for this book which was written by two savvy and very successful futures traders. Linda Bradford Raschke and Laurence Connors share some of the best contrarian trading strategies that you will ever lay your eyes on. Of particular interest are the Turtle Soup Plus One and the Turtle Soup strategies that key on false breakouts. These strategies can be applied both intra-day and on a position trading basis and are guaranteed to make you money. Read this book. It is no frills, just excellent trading strategies from two pros."
4,Great Diaper Bag!,Originally got this bag for my new baby and replace a larger diaper bag. The messenger bag is a good size to carry most items needed for going out with Baby and 1 toddler. Side pockets are great to store items that need to be access quickly. The wipes are located in an easy spot to grab when you need them without digging around to the bag. Only complaint is that the changing pad is too small. Would have liked a zipper pocket in the flap of the bag also. Excellent bag overall and will use it after the kids grow older.
3,target hates their customers and deserves to go bankrupt,"Cool, bag - Target shipped the wrong one so I ended up getting one direct from the manufacturer. As always I love Amazon's return policy and even with other companies errors Amazon takes care of you. Target on the other hand made this such a miserable purchase experience I will not purchase from them through Amazon again. Combine the embarrassment with the time I wasted to no avail in their store trying to get this handled quickly and it will be a while until I bother going to their locations again."
4,Beautiful poetry of a childhood,"I am an unabashed fan on Yoel Hoffman's books. This volume, however, is different - for the first time I felt on the outside looking in without comprehension. Why? I suspect it is because I am not Jewish and have never been to Israel. Hoffman has written a beautiful, poetic narrative of childhood. It is, perhaps, closer to prose poems than poetic prose. The images are multifaceted gems that are pleasurable to read. But the connotations that should have arisen from the references to Jewish writers, to children's songs, to Jewish festival prayers and hymns -- footnotes gave me minimal denotations. The rest was lost on me.I still recommend everything by Hoffman but suggest that you learn to love him from one of his earlier books before tackling The Shunra and the Schmetterling.Earlier works:The Christ of FishorBernhard"
4,Page-turner,"Engrossing, densely textured read.Could claim greatness on the basis of the Wragges and Madame alone, but also contains one of the most original heroines in Victorian fiction,and draws a fascinating portrait of venality, social corruption and hypocrisy -- at times, it reminded me of both 'Pere Goriot' and 'Les Miserables'.And it's full of those little concrete details that make nineteenth century fiction so deliciously materialistic. Don't miss out on the Oriental Cashmere Robe!"
5,What will Magic do?,"Subtly humorous story of Magic, the cat, who sits and contemplates his next move. What will he do? The possibilities for adventures with bears, blueberries, loons, and moose are endless. Illustrations are fun and realistic. The cat epitomizes cat-ness. Karen Woodworth-Roman"
1,$20 down the drain,I have read this book and I returned it to the store minutes after buying it. Not only is the artwork ugly and non- manga style but it tells you nothing about how to draw the pictures. How can they call this manga when it is clear mr. hart has never read a manga in his life. warning: stay FAR away from this book
1,more or less useless,"However unfairly, I believe that it is necessary to be able to draw manga before publishing a book instructing others how to do it.Unfortunately, the art in this book is very westernised (not to mention ugly) and most of it does not even approach a ""manga"" style, and threfore is pretty much useless to most aspiring manga artists.Avoid this book (and all other members of the same series by Chris Hart) at all costs."
5,Works great on my 1999 3000GT SL!,"I purchased the Tokico Clutch Master Cylinder from Amazon seller ""B2C Auto Parts"" last April(2012) and it's working GREAT! B2C Auto Parts had the best price and there were no problems at all with the transaction. I would purchase from them again. My husband and I replaced the original master cylinder (April 2012), which matched exactly to this Tokico, an OEM supplier to Mitsubishi and other auto makers."
3,A good book but not a romance (and a bit violent),"I think this is a fine book (and recommended it to my husband after I finished it) but I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic plot or anyone who is squeamish (or doesn't like reading the details of military campaigns). If you are just looking for good historical fiction, I would give it 4.5 stars, but if you are looking for a Heyer romance, I would give it about 1.5 stars."
4,Intelligent,Intelligent dialogues. Might be slightly slow for the american standards but the subtility of Bernard Rapp's way of observing human behaviour is very interesting and well filmed. Gireaudeau is excellent as often.
1,The for to weeping of the empty fullness,"When we see this of such a film in the always never to forgetting styles of the greats Rohmers, we are reminded of all of it. The overarching symbol of the forgetting; the trendentiousness of the cineastic plosiveness. Even Truffaut or Truffles as we used to call him would have thought the very long thinking thoughts, sort of. It was like, ""Who am I?""Wholesome Holistic holiness is a pejorative of the malodorousness of the geenfill hill. And lastly, we leaving you with this very thought, if it is a thought: ""Wagner is the Puccini of music."""
3,it was ok,"this cd was just that...ok.i like garbage,but this was not the best.the only song really standing out is only happy when it rains.so...if ur a huge garbage fan or u like pop buy this.if ur expecting their great new single why do u love me,dont."
5,Supercool,"This is an amazing record, and it's hard to believe it was only their first. There are so many different styles of music on here, ranging from the classic pop of ""Stupid Girl"" to the darkly sinister ""As Heaven Is Wide"". It also has an incredible opener ... once you hear the first four rapid drumbeats of ""Supervixen"", you'll be instantly hooked right through these 12 perfectly crafted tracks. There's something for everybody here. Check it out."
1,Doesn't fit eTrex 20,"The eTrex 20 has a built-in rail, and this is a rail mount. Should be a no-brainier, BUT it doesn't fit without a separate adapter (which I haven't been able to find so far). Why does Garmin sell a rail mount that doesn't fit its own rail? Check fitment carefully - this was a complete waste of money for me."
4,For Corporate Climbers Only.,"I believe this book is exclusively geared towards the corporate climber considering the advice, some of it rather cut-throat, given to the reader. If you live in the big city and want to scratch your way to the top this book is for you. However, if, like me, you're in the country and work for a relatively small company, you had better skip this one since you'll likely cause all of your co-workers to hate the ground you walk on."
5,The great original version of a fantastic movie,This is without a doubt the best version of the original story. A must buy for lovers of classic movies.
1,Great oldie that desperately needs restoration,"Dark, poor sound quality, quite scratchy (didn't they have a master to use?) Terribly disappointed in this, as I recall it from my youth and wanted to pass along a treasure. Instead, my 5-year-old only lasted about halfway before he asked for something else (he has great concentration and listened attentively while I read him the entire The Hobbit, so I know it wasn't a lacking on his part) Alas, the old treasure is not gold, but brass. Given the state of technology, someone could easily clean this up and make every viewer thrilled. As it is, I sadly say, pass it by, it's better remembered than seen in its present wretched state."
3,Sabu is great as Mowgli,"I have no idea how many jungle book movies hollywood has put out in the last hundred years, but in my opinion their are only two worth having in my DVD collection. The first and my favorite is the animated Disney version, but a close second is this one.What I truly enjoy about this version is the sheer adventure of the story. You also get a more accurate telling of the book, as well as the scenery which animation until recently could do no justice to.In my opinion what makes this movie so good is SABU, the actor who plays mowgli. He does so well with the part you begin to think they wrote the part for mowgli just for him.From the moment I watched this movie for the first time and from that day forward when I think of The Jungle Book, any Jungle Book, I think of Sabu.Great movie, and should be considered a classic worth having in anyone's DVD library"
4,"more thomas and suspense with less clothes, please","I am a huge fan of Marne Davis Kellogg. My friends and I have read all of her books and were counting the days until Perfect. I was a little disappointed. Kick is still a wonderful character, but there was no real suspense here and Thomas is too minor a part of Perfect-again. The clothes descriptions that were so much fun before seem a tad overdone, and the Mont-St-Agnes crowd left me cold. We need some personal development amd fun characters along the lines of Lilly Bennett and Richard Jerome which brings me to a good point. When is another book in that series coming out?"
2,Not so Perfect,"I enjoyed the style of ""Brilliant"" very much. It was original and fun. ""Priceless"" was much more uneven. ButI enjoyed ""Perfect"" even less. Kick has become smug, monotonous, and relentlessly self-absorbed. More importantly, she is humorless. After some chapters were over, I felt like I had just read an upscale shopping catalog. Plot and character development are being sacrificed for an unending parade of consumer goods descriptions. I think I should have stopped after the first book."
4,Dark Nights of the soul,"I highly recomend this book. It really makes you look into your soul very insightful, Spiritual. Very essence of Truth."
2,Slow reading,"Having been an avid, fast reader most of my life, I found this book hard to concentrate on. It is a story about a town and it's upper crust society among middle aged spinsters. The story has it's merits with good hearts and good intentions but the drawn out dialogue makes it hard to stay awake. There are times when I wondered why I continued to plow through to the end."
5,An Excellent E-Read,Such a very pleasant read and gives a nice view into the lives of spinster/widow women of the 1850's in England. This particular Kindle version is very well formatted.
4,Gentle English humor about life in a small town,"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."
4,A Classic in Cranford,"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the ""tea cup"" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."
4,An Interesting Portrayal,"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."
3,Cranford,Although this book is well written & enjoyable it is a bit of fluff. The characters are charming but the story is really just a meander through their lives. Would be a very good 'beach read' - nothing too taxing.
2,Disappointed in format,"I was disappointed with the quality of the book (not the story). I had expected a regular-size paperback (I failed to notice the dimensions when I ordered) and find this size unwieldy and floppy. It also apparently is a ""print on demand"" version and contains errors. I have not finished reading the book because of this and would not order this particular item again."
3,"Tastes good, but loses flavor fast","I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Fresh fruit falls in the middle of the pack. I really enjoy the flavor, but that flavor only lasts for about four minutes. (That's still twice the time of the two mint flavors.) According to the package, it has a mix of lemon, orange, banana, and pineapple flavors. I can't distinguish any of those - it tastes a lot like Juicyfruit flavor to me.I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth three stars despite the short-lived flavor."
2,Flavor does not last long and its imported from china,"The flavor does not lasted long, also of concern is that its imported from china. Hope mine is pure without any crap in it. Wish I knew about this before I purchased six of them."
3,Loses flavor fast,"I like the initial flavor of this gum, but it loses flavor very quickly. My kids seem to really love it, though, and since it is supposed to help prevent cavities, then I guess it's OK. Maybe it should be a 4-star rating if it really is helping prevent cavities, but for me the rapid loss of flavor is a big drawback."
2,Where did the flavor go?,Holds the flavor worse than fruit stripe gum.4 secs of awesomeness then it tastes like a chewing a tire.
4,Do you really want to know all this?,"The idea of using an engineering point of view to explore the dynmanics and controls of a dating scene can be very useful- but like one famous statistician wrote: All models are wrong (i.e., never completely capture the truth), but some are useful (attributed to George Box)! The Bayesian analysis falls in this category! Technically ok, but is it right or useful?This book contains some very eye-opening information about relationships. Quite frankly, there are some things that I would rather not know - but perhaps, if I could put aside my New England sensibilities, I would find the content useful!When I queried my husband of 20+ years, who also read this book, with the question: ""Is this really how men think?"" He laughed and said, ""Of course, (long pause watching for my reaction) ... not."" So what do I believe?I should probably give this book to my daughter (19 yrs) to read, too bad my husband took it to work to share with his male engineering friends...."
2,Six tracks omitted - not recommended,"At 38 min. long, this is an emasculated release of the original LP. Six tracks are omitted - The Preludium; The Lonely Goatherd; No Way To Stop It; The Sound of Music (Reprise); How Can Love Survive; Sixteen Going On Seventeen (Reprise). Not recommeded - buy the cassette instead."
3,Long Winded,"Unfortunately, Ashe chose to write his book in the form a detective mystery in which he explains how he unraveled the long-perplexing mystery of the historical Arthur. Thus, only near the end, does he actual set out his case. This makes for some tedious reading if one does not care about the mistakes of others before Ashe or is not already an Arthurian romance junkie. Hence, a general reader might want to cut the chase at the end of the book -- you can go back to crucial portions nearer the begining, which are cross-referenced by page number at the appropriate point. Still, despite his choice of a ponderous format, Ashe's argument and conclusions are compelling, and I think it take a very strong argument indeed to disprove his find. We have the real King Arthur at last."
5,Jumper Cables,"These Jumper cables are heavy enough to carry all the current I need to jump off my farm machinery on the farm. I like their flexibility, which makes them easy to roll up and unroll. The carrying case is large enough to accomodate the cables without cramming them in. I haven't needed the side terminal extentions on them since all my equipment has top posts, but they will come in handy if I ever have to jump off my family car. They are long enough to reach any battery wherever I may have to park to get to it. The shipping was fast and the price was cheaper than I could get them locally. It was a good buy."
4,Busy Guardian Angels,"I recommend this book. The author loves America. My own story is in it or I would have rated it 5 stars. All of us were either very lucky or our guardian angels worked overtime. The title conveys a disturbing message. If you need to spark your patriotism and appreciation for those who have secured our freedom, this should help you. If you need 'the impossible dream' to solve your problems, it may help you too. If you want to read unusual personal experiences from WWII, Korea & Vietnam you can easily find them in this book. There are 12 short stories of common men in war. ..."
2,Disappointed,I've owned two of these now and both have broken. The first one has an intermittent on-off switch and the second has had a failure in the spring that holds the head on tight.I can't see how to disassemble them to fix either.Most Welch Allyn stuff is much sturdier than this
5,Great sound!!,"David Sanborn's music has a great, sweet and mellow sound.I love it very much, and I always listen this album."
3,"Love Sick, Sweet Love","I am not a Dudley Moore fan, but this is one of his performances that rings true. It is a love story, unabashedly, and is told in a gentle, loving way. There are laughs, but often not far from tears, and would make a wonderful date movie."
5,If you don't get it you never will,"The Bunnymen have made some of the best jingle jangle pop rock of the last 30 years. Every song of their new album is an epic rollercoaster masterpiece. If you don't like them, you won't like them now, not with this effort. Maybe it is ultimately better if the masses don't like them, since I want this band to remain undiluted by the bland averageness so prevalent in the modern music business (emphasis on ""business""). Coldplay can fill in the gap for the masses, thinking they have found the answers, so mislead...So please, listen instead to Coldplay, Radiohead, Metallica, or Ashlee Simpson! Leave me my sacred Bunnymen!"
2,SMALL,"It is very small and lacks detail. I don't even know what to do with it, I just put it away when it came."
2,What Happened,"I was so excited about this game. It had new challenges and things I was looking forward to. I was very upset though when I started playing and found out that if you started the game as a one-player, you could not change a computer player to a non-computer player if a friend wanted to join. You could in Mario Party 2. Instead, now you have to start all over and that's no fun. I do however like the fast mode where the computer player are really fast. It sure speeds the game up and keeps me from getting bored. But, I really really miss the other feature."
2,mario trash,This Game Sucks! It takes 10 minutes just to get the game started and by then you will realise what trash this is. The mini games are stupid and pointless. The plot sucks even though I'm not sure what the plot is to begin with. I didn't play it long enough to find out. If you want a good Mario Party stick with number 1.
4,this game rocks,"way too cool, but its totally diffrent from 1 and 2 so look out. at leaste they got rid of those dumb costumes, and lowered item prices. but it still is sweet, go get it!"
4,"yes to the multiplayers, no to the single player","i would only recommend this game to people who have siblings or friends who live really close to you that can come over any time, because it is only fun when a group of people play."
5,Appreciation,I am very pleased with this purchase. I also am thankful with the service you provide. keep up the good work. Thank You.
2,"Excellent Sunscreen, Dreadful Smell","I like to hike and backpack between 10 and 13,000 feet in Colorado. Also I'd rather not wear a hat. My preference is alcohol based quick drying sunscreens for my thinning top and face. This product meets all my sun protection needs, EXCEPT the smell. An hour after application I'm still overwhelmed by a sweet citrus odor that limits where I can apply the sunscreen.Previously I had used a similar Bullfrog product that offered identical protection with no odor."
5,DVD Please,"I'm not going to write a review, because there are lots of good reviews here already. I'm glad to see everyone concurs that this series deserves 5 STARS. I'm quite sure that if 10 STARS were available, that is what Flambards would be awarded. I live in Singapore and I have the series on VHS tape. Unfortunately due to the humidity, magnetic media here go moldy / mouldy after a year or three. Please can someone put this fabulous series onto DVD. Please Please Please."
2,Uninspiring!!,"This was probably the weakest Sanborn work. I was not very impressed with the CD. I did like the tune ""Rikkie"", otherwise that's about it on this disappointing effort. You're better off buying some of his earlier or even later CD's. This is not the one you want. Move on!!"
4,Nature with little energy,"The Sound of the Mountain is a beautifully written book about very little. It portrays post-war Japan from the perspective of an older person, but it fails to make his experience of the war seem real. The book's greatest strength is the sense of the Japanese culture and its sensitivity to nature which leaves the reader aware that (s)he has had a real encounter with a world of unique delicacy. However, the attitudes towards women that are reflected in the book also show a society of great insensitivity.The greatest negative of this book for me was the lack of energy. The characters seem more like players in a noh drama than people. They go through stylized actions, but they seem to bring no force to bear in their lives."
2,SPOILERS in Reviews,"WATCH OUT, many plot SPOILERS in the reviews here. Haven't read this book yet, and made the mistake of reading some of these reviews. What were some of these folks thinking???"
2,Sound of snoring,"Kawabata's writing style, no doubt made worse by poor translation, is slow and plodding. The descriptions of scenery and trivial movements is overdone and detract from the final story. There were many points throughout the book that I just couldn't figure out what was going on because the writing was so muddled and the primary thread was simply not continuous.The book reads like a puzzle. The story is thin, and Kawabata attempts to weave every scene, every action into some over-arching theme (old ways good, but new ways may have good points too) that simply left me cold. However, there are many who like this kind of storytelling, so my experience should be taken with an appropriate amount of salt grains.Not having read the book in its original language, I can't say whether the translation helped or hurt the book. The words and sentences were certainly poetic, but ultimately empty. The poetry simply couldn't carry the poor plot, if anything it hindered it all the more."
3,"Sterling Silver Children's Ballet Slippers Pendant, 15""","This cute, although the ballet shoes are extremely small and hard to see the detail, the chain is thin, then it is fine to be used by a girl, it's just an ornament for the moment."
3,Not impressed,I have difficulty in understanding why they made this true melodrama into a movie. I was greatly disappointed.
5,F A B U L O U S!!,"Great movie. I never realized that highschool football is taken so seriously. I cheered, yelled, applauded and even cried. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Not to mention the kid from the movie Slingblade aged VERY VERY well..... Dont miss this one.!!"
2,Over-rated!!,"I have to say I was very disappointed by this movie. I felt the character development of the players was poor. I was thinking to myself ""do I care if these guys win or not?""...who are they? Secondly, the shaky video cam movement gets rather annoying. There were some nice football play-shots, but does not overcome the shortcomings of this movie."
5,Friday Night Lights,"This is a great story. The film is well done. Finally, the soundtrack is great. I watched this twice during my 24 hour rental."
1,Wrong DVD zone,The DVD I received was not compatible with my DVD player. It is only compatible with US DVD players and not european ones. Im therefore unable to see the film.
3,about as good as store-bought brands.,"Being female with thinning hair, I'll try anything to hide it or make it better. After trying numerous products available, I didn't find anything particularly outstanding about this one. It's about as good as other store-bought brands of thickening gels. Actually, I found that my Paul Mitchell ""Thicken Up"" (found at my local Wal-Mart) is a bit lighter to the touch. The price point is about the same too.What this product DID do well, is allow me to go about an extra day without having to wash my hair. It didn't dry my hair out, but for some reason, my hair wasn't as oily as it tends to get in the summer time heat. That's a big bonus factor for me, although, I will probably just stick to what I can buy locally.* Price is fair.* Thickens about as well as other store-bought gels.* Doesn't ""gunk"" hair up (but I do recommend using a hair dryer to set)."
5,If you buy one review guide this should be it.,"Prepared by the organization that writes the ACT. As a teacher who helps prep students for the college admissions tests, I know what most students are willing to do. Hours of study and review over a long period of time may be the ideal, but it is an unrealistic ask of most teenagers. Their most efficient use of time is to take practice tests and then look over the problems missed. This book has real questions direct from the source combined with good explanations of all answers. The overall review sections are short and to the point. Students may take practice tests one section at a time to avoid burnout (but must understand why they missed each question). A few hours spent preparing with this method will raise scores, probability of admission to certain schools and the amount of scholarship money a student is likely to earn."
1,Not as Great as it seems,"This book is really great if all your big need is some practice test.BUT, if you looking for something to renew your lesson, this book is NOT the one. Yes it does have some explanation and such, but it is not enough to make you learn the things that you should know, not just the right answer but how to get to it.I use the Cracking ACT from Princeton Review, it is really nice, refresh your memory about those lesson from back at school time, help you to understand better how to do things, not just what the right answer is. More like a guide and a teacher, teaching you how to solve the problem too. It really helpful to me, more than this book it self.When I do the test questions in this REAL ACT book, yes there are answers with tiny explanation of why the right answer is what, but not in detail of how to get to that right answer in deep. Pretty hard to understood if you have no idea how to do algebra at least in basic ( forgot about them or other reasons )."
2,Don't waste your time.,I purchased several different ACT/SAT study guides for my stepson. This one was the least helpful. Stick with the Princeton Review. It is the best.
4,One of Bobby Deol's best,"In my view this is one of Bobby Deol's best. This is different from regular Indian movies, which are usually long, dull, and predictable. Bichhoo is different, and even though it is a copy of Leon the Professional, it is great for an Indian movie. The story doesn't go soft and dry, the songs are not much of a disturbance to the pace, and Bobby Deol is believable as a tough-as-nails, battle-hardened, cold-blooded hero for hire! I didn't like his anti-cursing and anti-smoking attitude though, that was not realistic, not to mention his drinking milk like a good little boy, while he kills people for a living, was a bit out of place, oh well, this is an Indian movie afterall. The opening song with Hansraj Hans was a nice touch."
1,Don't Purchase This Item,"At the one year mark, it died. It wouldn't turn on. I opened it up and saw that the fuse was blown. I replaced the fuse and as soon as I plugged the power cord back in the newly inserted fuse blew. I was able to determine that the PC Power board inside the unit had a short in it. I tried to order a new board for it. [...]"
1,I wish I read these reviews before buying this Piece of...,"My brother purchased 2 of these DVD Players. One for himeself, and one which he gave to me as a christmas gift in December of 2001. Today Less than 1 year later both units are DEAD.Both units exhibited the same symptoms. The first thing we noticed was that the display was dead, other than that it seemed to be reading the DVD fine. Well after the copyright warnings, and production logos we quickly realized that there was no sound either.Several email correspondence with Toshiba tech support have been fruitless. I will get NOTHING AND LIKE IT!If this is how they stand behind their products I will never be buying another product bearing the Toshiba name.It is unfortunate that all of the satisfied users who have not had their DVD Players long enough to experience this problem have already left 5 star feedback. It makes for an artifically high overall review."
1,Defective Product--avoid!,"The sound on this DVD player went out after one year. After researching the problem, I learned that this is a common experience with this particular model (see cnet.com). And, apparently an unfixable one."
2,Good player....until it died,"Thanks to a number of announced and then-new DVD releases, 2001 was the year that I made my decision to invest in a DVD player, with the proverbial Christmas wad of dough. Doing research, I decided to buy either this model or a Panasonic (as they were the best choices available at my place of employment). When the time came, this was the only one of my choices in stock, and it worked wonderfully, as I purchased (and played) *a lot* of discs for it.Problem is, the power supply died one night (about a month after the warranty expired, and mere days before a number of shows I like were to be released on DVD), much like what's happened to a number of other reviews. Apparently, this model's power supply is universally defective, a shame given the general high quality of the Toshiba name."
5,A great buy!!,"I am a college student without a lot of money, but I love movies, and I have wanted a DVD player for some time now. I looked around and decided to get this one, and I love it! It is a great price and I have not had ANY problems with it so far! It is very easy to use, and has great features! I strongly reccommend buying this DVD player if you want a great player for a decent price!"
1,Great.....When it Worked!!!,"I thought I was getting a great deal on an player that would be adequate for an average viewer, watching 1-2 movies a week. It was fantastic for the first three months, with no problems whatsoever...then on the 98th day(yes, that's right, a mere 8 days past the warranty) it simply stopped working. It refuses to turn on, and the cost of repair is more than half of the original cost of the unit. Very disappointing! Will not be purchasing anything Toshiba in the future. Strongly recommend spending a few extra bucks on a unit with at least a year warranty."
2,"I thought Toshiba was a ""name"" brand.","I can watch one movie on this without it freezing... Office Space. Every other movie I have tried to watch freezes up at some point. The Mummy, Mummy Returns, Gladiator, Aliens,Cats and Dogs, Star Wars, and Castaway all freeze. And not just a quick freeze. I mean the kind of freeze where you go to the bathroom, get a soda, make a sandwich, and sit back down... and then maybe it will start back up. I have tried numerous times to contact the tech support folks at Toshiba and after sitting on hold for about 30 to 45 minutes, I get disconnected. I just hate this thing so much now. And the best part is, I can go out and buy another dvd player or pay to have this one ""fixed"". I would just look at other players. Don't buy this unless you like the built in potty break features of the freeze ups. (...)"
1,African American Dolls-Why are there so few?,"I have been searching for this doll for weeks now and can't find one single African American version of this doll. They are always unavailable online and in the store. Has Mattel or any other retailer heard of supply and demand? I refuse to buy a doll that my child can't relate too, as someone else on this review stated..VARIETY!!I have not seen any caucasian children walking around with black babydolls, so why should my child have to walk around with a doll that does not look like her. Simply put..Make more dolls of diversity. There is a demand..so therefore supply!!!! It's almost 2006, Mattel wake up and smell the market!!!"
3,Shop Early and Stop Complaining,"I can not believe how many people complained about not getting this doll. First, shop early if you know it is an in demand item. I can't understand why anyone is upset they couldn't find this in the MIDDLE OF DECEMBER! Second, maybe you should stop teaching your children they must have exactly this toy or else they should be disappointed. Their disappointment comes from their being TAUGHT to be disapponted in material things. Third, demographically it wouldn't make sense for there to be the same number of African American dolls as Caucasian. All of us who were forward thinking got this great doll well before the holidays and didn't have to rush around trying to find the Black version of it."
1,Tangled mess!!!,What a disapointment. My daughter is 6 years old and she cannot style the hair because it arrived in a tangled mess. The make-up does not appear to change color either. A waste of money....
4,patience is key,"Im so sorry to hear that so many people had a hard time finding the african american version of this doll! It was not hard to find in my town it wasnt up front with the caucasion ones, but they were on a shelf in the back of the store. My daughter and I have had sooo much fun playing with this toy she is only 3 but she can comb curl and style the hair and she has figured out the cold water thing ( mommy I need cold water!) The hair does tangle it is wirey to hold the curl and it works wonderfully you use the toy curling iron lie you would use a real one. as for combing out the tangles it can be done and if stored properly they wont come back the back hair isnt wirey at the base of the head start with that comb the hair out with the comb provided in small sections, I know this may take some time but it will allow for hours of fun and excitement. Good luck in finding your doll........if you still cant find it try contacting stores located in OHIO."
3,Can be messy,I loved the smell of the product but it got the bathtub messy after you're done. And who wants to spend time cleaning the bathtub after having a relaxing soak.
5,I carry this book every where I go. Love it!!!,"This is a great book. I've read it over and over. Great for anyone to read, but especially if you are an entrepreneur. I can't imagine not having this book or never having read it. You will want to take it with you everywhere. I've bought this book for many people that also love it just as much as I DO.It's a keeper and a WINNER!!"
2,Fix for Windows Xp Doesn't work,"The Philips ToUcam website has a fix for installing with Windows XP . I donwloaded the fix, and the text instructions, and tried it twice ,and the cam still isn't compatible with windows XP."
1,It doesn't have all the songs it should have,i know of other soundtracks of the same one that are much better
1,Worse than terrible,"I've been a fan of political and military-oriented thrillers for years, and have never read such a poorly written book as this one. Mr. Robinson is totally out of his element writing on the inner workings of the US government and military. However, what he lacks in actual knowledge, he makes up for with terrible writing.The premise of this book is valid, but his execution of the story is laughable. Ironically enough, his characters laugh at almost everything, especially at the wrong time. It's as if Mr. Robinson accidentally set out to write a book for the cricket and tea crowd.It's painfully clear that he did little research to prepare for this novel. The characters are shallow, poorly constructed, or outright unbelievable. Their motivations make no sense. Oh yes, and let's not forget the nonsense ""liberal democrats will destroy everything we know and love"" plot line.Save your money, this book isn't worth the paper it's written on."
1,Not what I expected,"This book is not what I expected. It is basically two hundred pages of a police officer's wife complaining about being a police officer's wife. Now, certainly, venting one's stress is important, and perhaps sharing one's feelings with others in the same situation has some degree of merit. However, the book claimed to be ""a book of help and hope for police families."" Well, I guess my main point is I didn't find too much help and hope. I felt like the book offered very little insight and the author dwelled on her complaints about her life."
3,Fair-To-Middlin' Temple Movie,"I wouldn't rank this in the top half of all the Shirley Temple movies of the 1930s. It's not the worst but it's far from her best. One thing for sure: it's definitely better than the insufferably-politically correct 1995 remake.""Amanda Mirchin"" as the owner of a school, is the villain in here and Mary Nash did her acting job well because you hate this woman as the film goes on. Temple, as ""Sara Crewe,"" overacted a bit with the fake teary scenes. She was never too realistic with those parts of a movie, but convincing in every other way.Also, I prefer Temple's more light-hearted films, of which this is not one, although Arthur Treacher was a good guy and fun to watch. He does two song-and-dance numbers with Shirley that help bring some brightness to the story."
1,worst adaptation,"I have read and reread ""A Little Princess""over and over and have seen three different versions 1939 1986 and 1995 the 1986 one is the one that closely follows the book the 1995 mostly does with a few changes but despite Shirley Temple'd fame back then she was horrible in this movie she did not make. very good Sarah there is nothing to save this movie all the characters come off as annoying and nowhere in the book does Sarah ever go searching for her Father she quietly accepted the fact that he was gone even in the 1995 one where he was actually alive now don't get me wrong I like Shirley's stand alone movies that is movies that are not based on classic children's literature because Fox had a tendency to screw those up in any movie not based on a book Shirley is a wonderful actress although I prefer Margaret O Brien"
2,Glazed over ending ruins the story,"Don't get me wrong, I adore Shirley Temple, and have since I was a little girl. This is one of the movies I will refuse to watch though. The magic of the original story of The Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is desimated with this Disney-ized version. The original story has Sara Crew's father die in war, which entirely turns around the little girl's fortune. But this film gives it a happily ever after Disney ending in which the father ends up not being dead at all. It ruins the plot entirely, and is a disgrace to the original. If you want a movie that lives up to everything the book was and more, check out the 1995 version ""A Little Princess""; beautifully done. If you want a good Shirley Temple Movie, check out Heidi, or Bright Eyes, or Poor Little Rich Girl instead."
1,"~ DUB, DUB, DUB your movie . . . ~","FINALLY! It's nice to see people actually commenting on the Q U A L I T Y of a particular DVD release for a change; especially when it's a movie like this one that now has around 25 different DVD releases over the years!Adding my 2 cents, this is one of the WORST quality DVDs of this title, right up (down?) there with UPC 798622308726 and UPC 645961100323. Don't bother with this release unless you'll be watching it on a 19"" or smaller TV. It is horrid."
3,The Little Princess,"The Little Princess is a book about a wealthy girl. She and her father have a very strong relationship because her mother passed away at the girl's birth. Unfortunately for the girl, when she turns five she must go to boarding school in England. Before her father leaves her he buys her a doll in a shop. She names the doll Emily. She talks to the doll and confides in it for she becomes lonely. She makes few friends. But she misses her father greatly and the teachers treat her poorly. But what happens when the girl's father passes away and his wealth is gone? Overall I thought this was a good book, it wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible. It was written beautifully it just wasn't exciting enough for me and I wasn't motivated to read it."
1,Dishonest/misleading,It is VERY dishonest to present the DVD is such a way as to allow the buyer to think they are getting two Shirley Temple classics. Why would anyone package these two movies together other than to mislead the buyer. The picture on the DVD cover shown on Amazon is not what I received.This item should be pulled from Amazon.
1,Not as good as it could have been,i liked this book but there are a lot of spots in it that just don't flow well togetherand i was also confused as to whether ben was african-american or if he was white maybe he was bi-racial either way it should have been better explained in my opinioni'm not putting down the author or anything but i personally think if your looking for a book that will keep you turing the pages don't get this one i regretted wasting my money on this one after i finished reading it
2,Irritated,"I am an Anthropology major and was required to take a Cultural Anthropology class for my major. Another Anthropology major took this class with me. By the end of the semester, we were contemplating buring our books because they were completely worthless. This book has a lot of bias to male studies, and male supremecy in general. If you need to know definitions, this is a book for you. There are literally hundreds of definitions in this book, and while many are defined correctly, some are not and show off the biasedness of this book. Overall it was ok, and it made me more aware of different beliefs in Anthropology, but I would not recommend this book to be used as a classroom text in the future."
2,Do not agree with the answers,"There are answers in the book that does not make any sense at all, especially towards the end of the book. Some of the wrong answers are obviously right, and I asked two of my friends who are also studying for the tests, and they both agree with me that the answers are a little ""fishy"".Furthermore, the author does not explain why the answer is the way it is. It just says ""WRONG, this is clearly not implied in the passage"" without any further explanation. Instead, it should tells us how to answer the question, strategies, what to look for, if we get it wrong / right, rather than merely explain with ""CORRECT, this is implied in the passage.""But then this is the only book that has enough practice tests, and I have seen even worse verbal practice exam book out there.I however like the examcraker books for the science section."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I am currently in the process of returning my second RIO 800 128 MB via the incredibly lengthy sonicblue RMA process (The first return took over 30 days to get a replacement). The players both lasted around 3 weeks before audio became garbled and then they ceased to work at all. Sonicblue customer support is nonexistant, their website offers no information about these players problems, and customer support is clueless even if you do happen to get ahold of someone in less than 30 minutes. DO NOT buy this ..."
1,"Worked great for 4 days, then it died","The Rio 800 arrived and I calibrated the battery. That was slightly annoying because you have to wait 5 hours before you can play with it. Anyway, it worked great for 4 days. Bought an audio book and loaded a ton of music on it. Went running with it. It was light and sounded great. Just like a CD. Sound went loud too, unlike some MP3 players.One day, however, it just wouldn't turn on. Called tech support, briefly explained thhe problem (it just won't turn on, tried to recharge but nothing happens). They needed no further explanation. Just send it back for an exchange or return it to where you bought it. Apparently, it is a great product if you luck out and get one that isn't buggy.Two other gripes: the headphones are terrible and the oval screen makes things hard to read sometimes."
1,after 8 months of use,"I bought the player because of its compatibility with formats from Audible - audio books. After 8 months, the battery is at 30% of its supposed strength, if you are lucky you can use it 3 hours instead of the claimed 11 hours. The battery dies real quick even if you do not switch it on. The display is flimsy. Hard to read - the oval display does not allow to see the full text. The menu has a lot of features, and 128MB is quite helpful, if your battery makes it. The box is made of cheap material that can break to easy. I also own a Rio 500,which is not working anymore.These are my last buys of Rio products. I do not understand its popularity: must be good marketing. I recommend using a device with AA battery slots, so you can put fresh power in, where ever you are."
1,Defective problems?,"My brother and I each got one of these for Xmas.I followed all the directions including properly calibrating the battery. Mine worked for about 3 days and then it died. It no longer turns on. If I plug the player into the AC adapter, the power LED on the battery blinks but the unit will not turn on. I decided to take the unit back and order a new one (everyone appears to be sold out though).Now my brother said he recently had a problem where his unit wouldn't power on either until he turned it off and on 3 or 4 times. I wonder if his is going to flake out on him too.I really like this player, but it appears there may be a quality issue."
3,"It's OK, but..............","I had bought my Rio 800 in July of 2001 and like many of the reviewers, I have had problems with it. The battery died after 5 months, also I had the thing replaced 3 times (for various reasons)! It is so delicate, that if you first drop it (without it being in the case), you won't hear anything. The headphones were OK, but get different headphones because they are so uncomfortable in the ears. I had sent it back in January 2002 and it took 2 months to get both parts!!! So far it's working great, since Rio has improved it's player. I love it anyway, despite how many times I had to replace it and how long I had to wait for a new one after I sent it back."
3,B.Y.O.B,"Bring Your Own Battery! I was having the same charging problems as many of you so I took the thing apart, put in a plain-old Duracell AA, and the thing works great. So far it's run about 5 hours and all is well... Granted,it's a money-eater over time, but if you're stuck with it anyhow, it's a valid alternative."
1,Sonic Black & Blue Rio 800,"I never spent so much money on something so worthless. I have had this for less than 2 months, and have only heard 8 songs on it. The battery won't keep a charge any longer, even though it indicates it is fully charged. If you need a decent door stop, this will suffice, but if you want to listen to music...."
4,Great little gizmo!,"i got my rio because i wanted to listent to Audible books. it works GREAT for this. the interface to the audible software running on your local pc and the server (usb) is fast, flawless and error-free. the memory capacity allows you to store all but the largest of books in a single pass.battery life is good.things i would improve: the writing for the display is microscopically small and almost impossible to read. menu system is not intuitive. there is no warning when the battery is dying. there is no car-charger, and the headphones you get with the unit are like a vice grip - unusable!but still, for what it does, it works great."
1,Be Very Careful,"When you plan to spend more than US$200.00 on a portable MP3 Player you expect to buy the Top of the line, or at least one of the best. Incredibly the Rio 800 is the worst electronic piece I ever turned my hands on. First, when you download your music (even 128 bit) when you play it back you hear some jumpin' and sounds in your songs, when you check your originals they are 100% fine, so it's just the MP3 player. But that's not the worst, the worst is when it get halted, you have to take out the battery and put it again in irder to reset it. I take it to the store and they told me that it was ok, after 5 minutes it went halted again. A humble recommendation DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Mine died too,"In June, I bought one of these, but with some trepidation because of the reviews indicating reliability problems. Sure, enough, it worked very well when I received it - better functions than any other 128MB unit I tried. But now, two months later, it has died. All attempts to reach RIO technical support are to no avail. (They don't have an 800 number, so my lengthy waits on hold have been on my nickel, and they don't seem to answer e-mail inquiries.) So, I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone."
3,not happy,"When I say not happy it does not mean that I don't like the songbook , it's just that they don't have the song I wanted which was Galveston"
2,Not too good,"Maybe I missed something, but this dry book of the evils of materialism was really bad. I think Dreiser was trying to do too many things at once. Explaining the evils of consumerism, spontenaity, and dependence, yet to good of having enough, gall, and trust is simply too much for a writer who prefers to call everything meloncholy. And what's with the rocking chairs?"
3,Twist ending on classic formula,"One of the reasons why Sister Carrie is worth reading has to do with the ending. If you've read any of these famous home-wrecking novels, where a young beautiful girl gets involved with an older man, and wondered if suicide always had to be the answer, here's your book. But surprisingly, the ending makes you sort of long for the good old suicide ending. Sister Carrie isn't bad, but a lot of the insights into human nature and society are expressed in the language of a talk-show self-help psychiatrist rather than a great author. There are better versions of this formula (Updike, Tolstoy, Wharton, Austen) but there is still something in Sister Carrie that makes it worth reading. Despite its title, the better character depiction in the book belongs to the lover rather than the heroine of the title. Like Updike, Dreiser makes you feel for the plight of the upper-middle class white man. And I mean that seriously, with no sarcasm."
3,"A decent novel with an uninteresting, foolish main character","I don't think I got all the way through Sister Carrie, but I do recall thinking that Carrie is an amorphous idiot with no real voice of her own and no opinions. She is completely inexpressive, hence we never really get to know her -- to understand her motivations. Perhaps this is Dreiser's intention -- indeed, Carrie's lack of strength is likely the main reason for her downfall. I wouldn't know -- her character was so aggravating, with her wishy-washy, inarticulate ways, that the book did not make a truly lasting impression on me. Not bad, though, if you have more patience and more time than I did."
3,an edited version?,I noticed some editing and chapter differences btw this version and the NY Public Library collectors edition my wife is reading
4,Theater makes any book better :),"Actually enjoyed this book quite a bit more than i expected to. I had read an American Tragedy and did not enjoy the read at all. This one had a few advantages over that one. 1- it is only about half as long 2- it has a theater twist and 3- was in a Lit analysis class as i was reading it and it was fun to see what each critical approach (feminist, marxist, psychoanalytic, and formalist) brought out in the book. Dreiser is a thorough enough author that reading this book through any lens brings new issues and view points to the surface. It would be fine to read just straight through, in fact still enriching and enjoyable, but for a good book to read with literary theory in mind or write a paper on this is a good one to choose..."
1,Virtually unreadable because of typos and errors,"I do not recommend this ebook version even though it is free. Whoever transcribed it made mistakes on every page, often multiple mistakes. It seems very carelessly transcribed and is too frustrating to read."
4,Bullfrog Blast,"I ordered the Bullfrog Webkinz for my sister for her birthday because she loves frogs. My daughter has the pink poodle, but the seam came undone underneath. It wasn't hard to fix, but a little annoying. I wish they were a little bit larger, but I like the price, so I guess it all works out. Overall a great toy. My kids are always fighting my husband and I for a turn at playing the games online!"
4,Different,"You have to listen to it more than once, Its a different CD but if you ever run a haunted house This is the album you want"
2,Blah!,"I think this cd is just a bunch of noise, and I was listening to it, waiting for some type of guitar to enter, but i was dissappointed when i heard some guitar come in at the third song. I really dont like this cd, unless it was halloween, cause its just creepy and too ambient for my taste. I like buckethead when he plays actual music. Too weird for Buckethead, if that's possible, and definately too weird for me."
2,Not for the novice French speaker,"I bought this book after loving another book of common expressions we hear in the US (or read in books) and wonder what their exact meaning is in their native language. I didn't enjoy reading this book of phrases because most of the French expressions were far too advanced for me. I had French in high school and German in college but I pick things up quickly and thought I would be OK with this book. The book is not a good reference for flipping through because a lot of the phrases are just not something you will ever run across while reading literature or even while in France on vacation. Also, it would be impossible to memorize these long phrases and put them to use unless you are very, very advanced in French. The title, Bon Mots (good words): How to Amaze Tout Le Monde (everyone) with Everyday French is misleading. This is not everyday French."
1,Don't buy this book!,The book has nothing on the 2000 to 2005. Some of the articles are poor copies. Some only have the first few pages but not the entire article. A waste of money!Toyota MR2: Takes on the Competition
1,hmmm... sad,"Really this review is just for all of the non-Frank Herbert books. You don't need to read any of these in their entirety to figure out why they suck. Bad prose is just bad prose, although sci-fi readers arn't always the most picky about that sort of thing. So bad that after waiting 20 years to find out what might happen next after Chapterhouse, I find that I'm willing to wait the rest of my life rather read more drek by these guys. There are other terrible flaws with the prequel series, but these are hardly worth getting into. But as someone with an interest in cognitive science and real AI, I just can't resist a jab at how utterly pathetic an attempt this all is to imagine an AI civilization."
3,Super Reader,"An group of outlaws lead by a Wormrider is increasing their numbers on Dune.A couple of decades after the death of Serena's child, Xavier Harkonnen and Vorian Atreides are leading the human resistance to Omnius and the Cymeks, with assistance from their Priestess, but not suspecting that they are being duped by a leading politician."
3,Maybe the next one will be great.,"If you are following the series, then my all means pick up this book. Some of the threads were actually page turners; however, I felt the book could have used a wee bit of editing. Too many story lines evolved into extinction. One of the things that bothered me was the passage of time for the characters. At no point is there a time problem, everyone kind of experience the passage of time the same way, as if there was just one clock in the Dune universe. What troubled me was the cast characters were commuting light distances during the course of the novel, but everyone was aging together. The mode of transportation was conventional spaceships: spaceships capable of folding space are invented in the volume, and used restrictively. Will I buy the next book of this series? YES!"
1,A monumentally awful book,"The characters are boring and obvious, the storyline uninteresting and the depictions of violence and torture quite distasteful. I won't even bother to finish it."
2,Everyone dies including the story?,"Unfortunately the story dies first.Like father like son.I do not think so.I had a difficult time staying with this book and could not wait to finish it.The zenshiites and zensunni rhetoric ruined it for me.Perhaps my expectations are too high,for it would be difficult to match the classic novels from Frank Herbert.However,In saying all this i will still read the third novel in this series because im a geek!"
4,"hey, this is actually kinda good!","Unlike Herbert/Anderson's previous ""Dune"" trilogy, this time around the second book is not only as good as the first, it's quite a bit better. Sadly, the main problem from ""the Butlerian Jihad"" is held over: Herbert/Anderson BADLY need a competent editor. There are so many badly written sentences (and a few out-and-out grammatical errors) that it became distracting.Luckily, the plot is sufficiently good to keep me from being distracted for long. Once again, I can't honestly say that it meshes up perfectly with Frank Herbert's work, but on its own, this is a pretty gripping sci-fi epic, with memorable characters (I'm particularly fond of Erasmus, one of the better villains I've read in a while) and a satisfying ambition.Maybe future editions can clean up some of the sloppy prose and correct some of the errors. It's a shame for a fundamentally good work to be marred by material that is entirely fixable."
2,"Intelligent & influential, but not enjoyable.","There are anarchic tribes on earth & there have been socialist anarchist societies who ran communities in history. You're better off to read about them. I did like the ambiguousness because it made my belief that the capitalist ""dystopia"" was better off then the anarchic ""utopia"" seem like a valid interpretation. It was also nice to see what someone from an anarchy would be like, since historically speaking I can't think of a working libertarian anarchy. I sort of liked left hand of darkness, but I think UKLG writes some of the most intelligent, but least enjoyable science fiction out there. Don't misunderstand me I do like intelligent stuff like Of Mice & Men, Canticle for leibowitz, The divine comedy, don quixote, etc. I just say that so you won't offhandily disregard this."
2,Social studies disguised as sci-fi.,"This book should be of great interest to anyone studying (or having an interest in) anthropology and other social sciences and having an interest in social sci-fi. I didn't like it, though. It is ambiguous in message and cerebral to the point of being annoying. It is a perfect example of 'soft' science fiction, written for the folks who prefer anthropology over physics. The funny thing is, I can't understand why it was in the libertarian Prometheus' Award Hall of Fame, next to 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Heinlein and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Rand, since it is completely different from the other winners. If it's given to you, though, it is worth a read, I guess."
2,Boring.,I could not finish reading this story. Nothing happens.It's philosophy disguised as science fiction. Dull.
3,Sociology 101,"This is a nice book, and it kept me engaged, amazingly. There isn't much action here, just interesting themes and thoughts and the struggles of one man to explore ideas and to fit into society, both of which become herculean tasks. Do not get this book if you want exciting sci-fi action or if you want sci-fi technology. This is a book for sociologists and explorers of human society."
3,Nothing Spectacular,"This book is a good read and has some insights worthwhile, but nothing spectacular. Basically the best thing I received from the book is ""excess is excrement"", too bad the author could not have followed her own advice when writing this book, which is largely a discourse on Anarchism. Don't wast your time, unless you're looking for a description of how a ""Utopic"" Anarchy itself could work. Looking at the genre of science fiction itself, I recommend: ""Flowers For Algernon,"" by Daniel Keyes, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" by Arthur C. Clarke, ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert, or ""Ender's Game,"" by Orson Scott Card."
3,Paper on Karl Marx philosophy 101,"How can you write a philosophy and get it published in science fiction. Simple! You just put the society free of institution, where everyone works as much as the other, where people free of material possessions, living behind the huge wall that separates them from other civilizations on one planet. And put the society where top 5 percent just party all days long, while other 95% work for them on another planet. The main character, who lives on the first planet is the major scientist, who has breakthrough ideas nobody on his planet listens to. So he decides to go to another world, where his ideas might be put to life, because all the major scientists live on that 5- 95 % planet. However, he learns there a few important things about human societies on two worlds.P. S. The only accomplishment by Le Guin in this book is the scientific idea she intoduces through the main character : instantenious communication ansibles."
1,Move Over Ayn Rand,"LeGuin does for anarchosyndicalism what Ayn Rand attempts to do for capitalism. The difference? LeGuin succeeds. -The Dispossessed- occupies a place of high honor on my bookshelf right next to -The Left Hand of Darkness-, -The Moon is a Harsh Mistress- (Heinlein)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Many years after a revolution, the moon-planet system in the Dispossessed has a society that is again calcifying into de facto power structures.The protagonist in the novel is a scientist exploring the nature of time, whether linear, or more complicated.The book looks at some of the political implications of anarchy, and utopia, and what realities actually get in the way."
3,For McKuen fans only,"I'm not a big Rod McKuen fan. I bought this CD only because it was available at a very low price and it included one of my favorite songs, ""If You Go Away"". It's pleasant enough listening but after a few songs Rod's vocals tend to wear thin. There are two or three tracks tracks performed by French artists, notably one by Jacques Brel.Fortunately almost all of Rod's vocals are done in English because his attempts at French just doesn't ring well to my ears. The McKuen standards ""Seasons In The Sun"" and ""I've Been To Town"" are a couple of highlights. I'd say if the price is right and you have no major problem with Rod McKuen in general, go for it!"
5,Great Product,I had the swivel sweeper before. This sweeper is much more sturdy and powerful. Works great.
3,Powered sweep roller w/built-in dustpan,"For a motorized sweeping brush to hopefully fill the built-in dust pan, it works okay if that is what you want. Even though the stats indicate it's a three brush, it is, but the two on the side are only operated by moving the sweeper so the wheels turn. For the price and having to pay perfect attention to battery charging -- so they don't get burned up from overcharging -- consider your purchase wisely and don't expect more than that from a simple broom and dustpan."
4,Decent sweeper for every day use,This sweeper is decent. I have used the swivel sweeper that my mom has at her house and this is comparable. I like it for every day use and it picks up a lot! Of course it's not a substitute for a vacuum so I use this every day and then bring out the big clunky vacuum once a week for the hardwood/tile. Works alright even on small doormats or something with low pile but I wouldn't recommend it for high pile carpets. Overall I am pleased with my purchase!
1,BUYER BEWARE,"FALSE ADVERTISING!First of all, let me tell you that i have had a 2880-B for 5 years and it was a powerhouse. I then bought a 2880-A in a local store...not the same. It wasn't quite as powerful and broke very quickly- not impressive.When I saw this advertised, (blue- NOT red) ... I was excited. BUT BUYER BEWARE. When it arrived it was NOT 2880-B (blue) but was the 2880-A (red). FALSE ADVERTISING. If i could give ZERO stars, that's what they would get!Customer service is non-existent (you will receive a creepy automated message stating they aren't available) and they will now charge me a 10% restocking fee - to take back an item I didn't even buy!Now I'm stuck with another piece of junk. DO NOT BUY!"
5,best unpublized sweeper,"We have used a Shark recharable sweeper for years. Finally dided in February 2011. As usual I went to Amazon for help in looking at a varity of sweepers. we were looking for a sweeper that would sweep small area rugs & wooden floors. We looked at the many that was offered by Amazon and decided to purchase a product name that has been in business of years. Took a little longer to arrive, however the wait was worth every penny spent."
1,Bissell Perfectsweep turbo sweeper,"My old and tired quick sweeper died after three years of daily use. Because of it's reputation, I bought The Bissell ""perfect""s sweeper"" turbo thinking that it might be as good as my other sweeper. The Bissell does nothing but make alot of noise, does not pick up anything from my berber carpet AND if it is in a good mood, it just might pick up one or two fur balls. False advertising to the point of disgust. THE SINGLE STAR REPRESENTS THE SELLER'S QUICK DELIVERY RESPONSE. Shame on the seller and Amazon's integrity in checking out products and sellers."
2,Not Carpet-Friendly!!!!!,"I bought this on Sat., 1/13, and returned it Mon., 1/15!!!! It charged up perfectly fine, but when I went to use it, despite the ""quiet"" sound, I was amazed at how it was ""bearing down"" on the carpet!!!! It was actually slightly tough to push, due to this!!Our carpet is only a year old, in ""loop"" style, so I promptly returned it, as I was afraid it would ""pull"" at all the loops! YIKES!!!! Maybe great for regular floors, but I DID NOT find it carpet-friendly, at all!"
2,1998 edition,"News, adds, addresses... A lot of information and adds, but it's the 1998 edition of a magazine, not a book. Few text, a lot of ""making a team"" information, but not useful for driving. Not hints, not driving information."
1,Not smell good,"It's dissapoiment, It's really bad fragance. It is a product that seems rebuilt and really smells very badIt is a product that seems rebuilt and really smells very bad"
1,Very Disappointed!,Not only was my eight year old granddaughter disappointed.....so was I. This was a Christmas present I decided to get my granddaughter after she expressed her desire to have one (we saw the commercial for it). The hair is a mess and not at all fun to untangle. The make-up didn't work as it does on TV and the press on nails wouldn't even stay on. My daughter and I sat down with my granddaughter and read all the instructions and followed them to the letter. We are totally disappointed with this Barbie product especially because it IS a Barbie product.
1,Wish I had my money back...,"I bought this for my little girl for Christmas last year. She dragged it around for 6 months by the hair, not letting me throw it away because it was Barbie, but not able to play with it because it absolutely does not work. The hair was uncombable. This year, I got the Corelle dolls into my own store, and they had a version of this toy, only it looks like a little girl. I brought it home for Christmas, and at first, my daughter didn't want it because it didn't look like Barbie. However, she opened it, and the hair combs like real hair, and the makeup is nice. Way worth the money. Go to an independent toy store and buy the Corelle doll head. It is worth every penny, and a more suitable image."
3,Not Worth The Money!,"I thought this would be definite hit since my (then) 3-year-old loved to comb hair and paint nails. However, she lost interest fast when she could hardly get a comb through Barbie's hair. Then I tried dragging a regular brush through it and I finally lost patience and arm strength!The nail-painting were a disappointment as well, the colors weren't as vivid as advertised. All in all, this was a very disappointing toy and for sure not worth the $30."
1,"Terrible, Terrible",Let's just say that this toy has gone to our local dump! An adult can't even comb through that mop of a hair! A real waste of money!
3,Bad hair day!!!!!,They definitely need to get a better doo for Barbie in the hair dept.No comb or brush will get thru it. Everything else is okay.
1,"DURABLE, yes","This is the most horrible styling head I've ever been unfortunate enough to know about. The hair is OBSCENE! I understand the heavy fishing line interspersed (so the hair holds the curl from the ""curling iron"") but since it is so tangled a child can't get the iron in the hair. It is NOT fun to brush or do anything else except for maybe cutting it. That's why I listed it as being durable because you can cut all it's hair off out of frustration. We even tried to use shine gel and detanglers, so it was softer, but in no way resembled hair. I'm guessing the manufacturer doesn't have the same amount of fish line in each head, because all the fish line was on the doll we had. The nails didn't stay on (child or doll). The instructions for the color change did not work (her nails are ALWAYS blue) I'm just disgusted at the quality control for this toy."
2,Bummed out Mom,"My little girl got this from santa and was so excited till we tryed it out. When you apply a certain tempature water the makeup and nail polish is supposed to show up. It didn't and she was very frustrated because it took quite a few applications till we got it to show up a little bit. It was a bummer because the toy was not cheap and we expected it to work, the hair however does actually keep the curl from the curling iron which I was impressed with."
2,Surely Disappointing,"Our 5 year old received this toy as a gift. We were very excited about playing with it but it's only been two months and the toy is hardly used. Largely due to the fact the hair tangles easily, the curling iron continues to come apart if they grab more than a few stands of hair and the press on nails fail to stick. She has more fun with the simplier styling heads as she can manage the hair herself."
2,Just OK,"My 4 year old was really excited to put makeup on Barbie, however there is no obvious color change no matter what temperature water you use. She still likes to pretend style the hair (which knots up after one or two uses), and keeps trying to change the makeup even though it's doesn't work. Fun if you don't expect too much."
5,Great Stuff!!!,All the other fruit flavors and mint flavors are absolutely NOT what you want to taste when you have a sour stomach. The vanilla cream and especially the coco flavors are particularly sooth & creamy but unfortunately are becoming increasingly rare to find. Surly hope aren't discontinuing this item because I have never heard it even advertised and I'm sure it would be flying off the shelf if they did.
2,What's the deal on the price?,"Tums Smoothie, Extra Strength Antacid/Calcium Supplement 750, Cocoa & Creme , 60 Count. I looked and looked to see how many bottles of these I would receive for the price. Apparently, only one. I found a bottle of the same thing at Walmart (finally) last month for about $5.00. Apparently, the vendor is making a healthy profit on these. I put the Extra Strength orange sugar free Tums on my wish list until I get to Walmart to see if they still have the chocolate Smoothie. You can get 4 bottles of 80 count each of the orange chewables for $21.96. Two stars because of the price."
1,what the..?,"I have had nothing but problems with this software since purchasing it several months ago. Sometimes (rarely) it will perform, other times it just freezes up or refuses to burn a CD. I have wasted countless hours and numerous CDs that failed to be written, not to mention hours on the phone ($$$$) to technical support, all to no avail. Unless you enjoy frustration and throwing away a lot of money for absolutely no end result, I would suggest buying anything but Toast."
1,DO NOT GET IT!!!,"No TV codes, and I have a Sony TV. Just about every remote can work with Sony. I bought it mainly to control my xbox and netflix and liked the idea of light up buttons. Bought this online after a few drinks and wished I'd never gone ""drunk shopping"". I will send it back and give up the lighted buttons for a better remote."
4,Reaction,The reaction of my girlfriend when i bought it was very good...she loves it very much and uses it all the time
5,AMAZING,"for all the people saying that this album was the reason Chris Poland gave up on metal, shut up. Chris Poland never really played metal . . . in Megadeth he primarily did solos, and those solos are jazz. Damn the machine, jazz solos. Circle jerks, kinda jazzy punk bass. Ohm: jazz. OHMPhrey, jazz. All his solo stuff, jazz."
2,I'm sure it would have been a great instrumental album...,"Sorry, can't get past the vocals - I was looking for something more like OHM, which is far superior to this! Go check it out!"
2,AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!,"This product worked great for almost five years until it developed a leak. I've learned online that this leak is common and is due to a poorly designed seal between plastic and steel pieces. Obviously, Rowenta doesn't care about those who use their products if they design something so poorly. You'd think they outsource their engineering to Kenmore, expert of the ""break a day after warranty"" gimmick. There's nothing duo power about this when it's sitting in a puddle of is own water.I pulled a B&D; that I'd recovered from the trash years ago. It does the job without leaking. Never again, Rowenta!I gave it two stars rather than one as it gave us five good years. I guess we're some of the lucky ones with this unit."
3,Excellent Iron . . . while its working . . .,"I purchased this iron approximately 3 years ago, because I value a quality iron. After using it, there is no question in my mind that Rowenta makes a very effective iron product. The problem is that it only lasted 3 years . . . I was expecting an investment in a quality appliance to last at least 5 - 7 years. This is a disappointing result and I'm not planning on buying a Rowenta to replace this one."
3,[Out of Four stars] Wayne accomplished more than Andrew expresses but still a good read on the 'Great One',"Wayne Gretzky obviously is the greatest Hockeyplayer ever (and Mike Modano is the best weAmre-I-cans have produced, so far). Thoughthis book is more show than tell, it stillis a worthy tribute to Gretz. There are othersbetter though."
5,A must read for health and fitness enthusiasts!,"I first read this book about 10 years ago. I was interested in finding out why an acquaintance of mine, who had some form of intestinal cancer in 1976 and was given up on by regular doctors, was able, through advice from a homeopath doctor, begin and keep a regimen of a raw vegetable juice diet and become totally free of the cancer. I met him after he had been free of cancer for about 8 years. He raised a fantastic large garden of vegetables and had juicing equipment of all stainless steel, the likes of which I had never been able to find until now. I am in the process of getting information on prices and quality of equipment. When I find exactly what I want, I hope to begin using raw vegetable juices in my diet. M.R. Wirth"
5,mystery,"My husband and I got hooked on Midsommer Murders a few years back and have every single episode of the series that is available. Not only do we love them, we watch them over and over and believe it or not sometimes we even forget who was the murderer when we haven't watched an episode for a while. We find ourselves laughing out loud, still, at some of the comments made by Barnaby or his side kick. It is quite an enjoyable series and I highly recommend it to mystery lovers everywhere. We are even thinking about taking a trip to the area ourselves one day and visit the sites where they shot these."
3,I feel cheated,"This particular set contains, as everyone has already noted, only three episodes, which I thought were quite entertaining and well done. In some ways, these were the best in a long time. The fourth disc - Super Sleuths - was 47 minutes of rambling, not especially interesting or entertaining, and rather disappointing. These interviews with the stars could easily have been bonus material on disc two and/or three, which happily would have made room for a fourth episode in the set. I can't help but feel a little cheated."
1,Seller didn't give us all the episodes,We love Midsomer Murders. They come in sets. This set had three separate movies each in separate cases. Two were the same and one was completely missing. No response to emails. I went over the 30 days return policy because it was a birthday present. It seems checking the names of the episodes before mailing would be a professional thing to do. I just needed what was supposed to be in the box. I won't use this fellow again and suggest you don't either.
5,Fantastic Praise CD,This CD is awesome. The Praise and Worship is phenomenal. I love it!I love to worship God and this CD delivers the atmosphere for worship. You can actually have Church in your car as you drive down the road.
4,"Classic, of course","This is, of course, the classic beginning reader by Dr. Seuss.What can I say about it that has not already been said? Honestly, I can't think of a thing. Just that it is a classic, and has taught many children how to read, and is a fun read-aloud to younger kids as well."
1,Do not waste your money,"I received this movie yesterday for my niece and viewed it before giving it to her. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. All it was was the book being read to me. No animation, just scans of the book. I can read the book to her and have more enthusiasm than the person on the tape and I can have the quality time with her.IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH THE SHIPPING LET ALONE THE PRICE OF THE TAPE."
4,A Great Book,The Cat In The Hat is a great book. It's about a brother and sister who are left alone on a rainy day and told to be good. Then the cat in the hat comes and they do all sorts of stuff. I think this book is funny and interesting. Dr Suess is a good author and I recommend The Cat In The Hat and other Dr. Suess books to any child.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"When the parental units away, the cat will play. Take a kid, and a cat, and a lot of smaller cats, and a bunch of toys, and many snowballs and other devices of childish warfare, and you get a barrel of laughs and entertainment, indeed.You just have to be good at the fast cleanup."
5,Upstream O2 Sensor for Tundra,"2001 Tundra V8 - Error code P0155 - ""Up-stream"" O2 Sensor on passenger side.Amazingly, the sensor unscrewed quite easily from the exhaust header using a Lisle 12100 Oxygen Sensor Socket. What was a bit tricky was releasing the wiring clip. It has a squeeze to release retaining clip on the opposite side from the engine. When I used a flat head screw driver in just the right spot to release the retaining clip, the connector came loose with minimal effort. I have fairly strong hands, but I couldn't manually squeeze the release clip hard enough without the aid of the screwdriver. The sensor, including the length of the wiring, was a perfect fit for my Tundra.The error code has remained off, so I assume all is good."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"YOU MAY SAY OH JUST B/C I'M 13 THAT MY REVIEW ISN'T WORTH READING B/C I AM ONLY 13. BUT DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! MY COUSIN AND I BOUGHT 2 FOR EACH OF US AND ON THE FRONT OF THE ELECTRONIC IT DOESN'T SHOW THE PHONE JACK CORD, AND IT SHOWS PEOPLE ON THE PHONE. SO YOU WOULD ASSUME OH IT HAS TO CHARGE WELL NO IT IS NOT A CORDLESS PHONE, THEY BASICALLY FALSE ADVERTISED ON THE COVER. YOUR PROBALLY THINKING OH WELL IT SAYS HANDS FREE AND I KNOW THAT BUT LIKE I SAID IT DOESN'T SHOW A PHONE JACK CORD ON THE COVER SO YOU MAY ASSUME THAT OH WELL THIS IS COOL B/C IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS A CORDLESS, BUT IT ISN'T. SO IT IS BASICALLY TELLING EVERYONE IT IS A CORDLESS PHONE."
3,Isn't a rip off of Darkness Falls,"I hate to burst everyone's illiterate bubble...Fear of the Dark DIDN'T rip off Darkness Falls, it is the other way around. FEAR OF THE DARK came out in 2002...Darkness Falls came out in 2003. you do the math...This movie does have it's creepy moments. Way better than Darkness Falls in my opinion..."
1,Not scary at all!,"Fear of the Dark is a good story line and the young actors were very good, but there was not one scary thing in this whole movie. I'm not sure why it didn't work, but I guess if you were between 7-13 your imagination would have gone wild with anticipation."
1,no WPA support,"This does not support WPA, which is much more secure than WEP. This would not be a good idea for any modern home network because WEP is too easy to hack."
5,WOW,If only the rest of the software/hardware industry adobting this easy installation and useability. I bought two of these to work with my wireless router and was up in no time. Now with WinVNC installed I'm able to exchange files between both computers and surf the net at blazing speeds.
1,Linksys problems,"I purchased this product, described as specifically designed to work with Windows 98 Second Edition, but am unable to use it. I was able to install it and connect to the internet for a short time, then my computer shuts itself off while I am connected to the internet. I took the computer to a shop where they checked everything and reloaded Windows but it still is not compatible and shuts my computer down at random times. I can't use it. I'm frustrated that it is billed as working with Windows 98 SE and it doesn't, at least for me. I wasted my money on the adapter as well as $80 for the ""repair"" that didn't help."
1,Product not as expected.,"When ordering this product I did a search for Linksys Wireless G adapters. This was the product that came up in the search - it still does. I know it's my fault, because I did not realize that the b at the end of the part # meant it was wireless B. These are not compatible with the Wireless G product I already have. I bought these as replacements for some adapters that quit working. So I'm stuck with paying for something I can't use. Not a happy camper! I have been happy with the Wireless G adapters - but have no use for the ""B""."
3,Quirky - but they all are...,"I have three different types of wireless adapters - two by Linksys and one by Netgear. None of them are perfect but if all is right with the world and your computer, this one is relatively easy to install and usually works well signal-wise, particularly with a booster on your router (bought the Linksys booster for their wireless router and there was a huge improvement with all of these devices).Take note of the installation procedures since each OS has different steps to follow. On a few computers, the software doesn't seem to install but actually does. And once in a while, Windows decides it doesn't recognize it and you might have to go through the whole installation again if unplugging it and plugging it back in doesn't work. As I said, quirky, but they all are."
1,Do not bother,"The lack of documentation and spotty support, combined with a much too complicated configuration setup has cost me hours of valuable time trying to straighten out problems; not to mention downtime due to unstable service. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a simple, reliable way to connect their network wirelessly. I have friends who swear by NetGear.I am sending my Linksys back."
1,It works... eventually,This product will work with windows 98 however much tweaking is needed and many hours on tech support. One thing I will say is this adapter randomly decideds which XP computers it wants to work on. I have it configured corectly but why make a product that goes against windows thats made for windows? If you ask me you should have to configure it to work against windows not the other way around!
2,Doesn't work With Tivo,Just wanted to inform everyone that this product doesn't work with Tivo for a broadband connection. Use the NetGear WG111. It works great. Just wanted to prevent someone else from buying a product that isn't compatable with TIVO.
3,Connection Losses,"Every 5 minutes or so, the connection just ends and starts. It works as advertise but these disconnections are annoying, i cannot download anything at all. Does the same for all my friends."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"This adapter was a snap to set up and the reception is great. From what I have heard they work better than the internal pc cards they sell. The only problem i have had with the product is that the wall mount they give you is somewhat flimsy, and I have had to finally just tape it on the wall. But overall, this is a good product for the money!"
2,Not enough power?,"I got a couple of these along with a Linksys router. It was a bit of a pain to get everything going - more than I expected. But it all seemed to work OK. But over time, one of my machines consistently had slow internet response. I checked and was getting dropped packets. The that worked OK was one room away through a wallboard and 2x4's wall - about 10 feet. The one that didn't work was a couple walls and a plywood floor away - about 18 feet. I finally replaced it with a PCI-based card which is working fine. I can only guess that the USB-powered WUSB11 just doesn't have enough power. It was unacceptable at a pretty short distance. I'm continuing to use the other one OK."
4,"I like it, some people not but this is the secret of using these wifi dongles :)","I like it, some people not but this is the secret of using these wifi dongles :)Do Not Install Their Application !!! Yea do not install their software because they always suck!! Install only Driver and use windows settings to control it.To get the driver, install software, find driver folder in software installation path, copy them somewhere, uninstall software and then use that driver to enjoy device!!"
1,Get the Alfa AWUS036H instead,"Not a good product, used it for a year only get 2 bars, end up I bought the Alfa AWUS036H. I got 4-5 bars!"
5,The best wireless adapter yet!,This is replacing a wpc11 - Had this unit setup under Windows XP on my compaq armada laptop in less than a minute. I get a full strength signal from my couch with the wusb11 where I used to get a 20-30% strength singnal with the wpc11. I am very satisfied with this adapter.
2,Frequent Dropped Connections,"Works great, just drops connection about once every 15minutes. It re-connects, but takes a few minutes to do it. I've tried new drivers, and multiple machines. XP just doesn't seem to like it.Jason"
4,Nifty device,"I bought a WUSB11 to hook up my Windows 2000 PC to my wireless LAN (using Linksys wireless access point).Setup was very straight forward - per instructions I ran the program on the CD-Rom to install the drivers, then plugged the device in.Although I don't move my desktop machine around much, nor do I move the access point, I've never seen the signal strength fall below 97%. The device is about 25 feet and one wall removed from the access point.The design of this device is very sleak. Dimensionally, its about the size of a deck of cards. The only cable is the USB cable to the computer - there is no power cable required and, just as important, no need to take up a socket on your powerstrip with a plug from this guy.The one negative is that once I added this device to my home network, the Linksys wireless card I use in my laptop seemed to get a much lower signal strength from the access point. I can't help but wonder if somehow the WUSB11 signal is so strong that it interferes?"
2,"If it works, it works great","I set up a network of 4 pcs with the Linksys router. Of the three of these cards I've tried, only one works. The one that works, works great and couldn't have been simpler to install. I returned the defective one and got another defective one in replacement. I called Linksys tech support - tech said I just had bad luck in getting two bad cards - maybe I got an older version of the same model number....not a great response."
5,Great Trip Hop with an Edge,"Preston Klik delivers once again! For all you My Scarlet Life fans, this new incarnation is even better, with great singing by Chandra Clark. Some of the tunes are trance inspiring, while some have a harder, more rythmic edge."
4,really good slow Cut,R.kelly Wrote&Produced this Cut for Toni Braxton&it works well with Her Range&Style Presentation. this Song has a strong vibe that echos alot of what Toni was doing on her Debut Album.this Song was from her 2nd Album&It was a Big Hit.this is a Nice Song.
3,Natural healing is much more,Too simplistic for a 'Doctor yourself' book. When we suggest to people ways of healing we should always give them as 'whole' picture as possible like for example most of the dietary and supplementary nutrients implicated in every health issue mentioned.
3,...Interesting,"I have read this book for a book club at school. It's not horrible, but it's also not the best. My favorite author is Jane Austen so I thought it would be nice to read books that were written by the people who influenced Austen. I have yet to read the rest of Radcliffe's novels and this hasn't stopped me from doing that, but this isn't the best. However, it is free so I would try it."
4,Viewsonic Q19WB 19-iInch LCD Monitor,So far I pleased with this monitor for the price. The only bad faults to it is the on board speakers are really bad. You will have to have your on speakers. It also does not have a DVI output. As far as everyday use this monitor works fine.
5,Good value,I suppose all major computer mfgs preload a lot of free trial software these days and HP sure has alot preinstalled. It takes awhile to uninstall the componets not needed but the end result is a very nice computer for the money. Very quiet and fast. I installed a new graphics card quickly to enhance our photographs. The original onboard graphics should be acceptable to most though. A very good computer for the money!
1,I will never buy HP again,"HP tech support does not understand basic English. I have wasted dozens of hours trying to get OS cd's to use for the replaced Hard drive. Computer was purchased 11/2006, and has been unusable for last month. Tech support denies problems, lies about status, is completely incompetent.Oh - and, guess what! HP is *out of stock* of it's own OS cd's. No estimate of when they will get more!! This was a complete waste of money. I will buy a Dell now, and paying 3 times more would be a bargain compared to this."
1,Good luck getting help when it breaks....,"I got my Rio 600 for Christmas this year and it was frustrating trying to install the software and get it working. Once I'd figured that out, I listened to it for 2 hours total before the unit completely died. I have spent days trying to get email help from tech support and once I finally got a guy on the line at tech support (on a half-hour long distance call) he said they are no longer making Rio 600s and I had to take it back to the store for a refund. He couldn't help me. What a waste. Sonic Blue has abysmal customer support and products that fail right out of the box. Think seriously before buying a Sonic Blue product. Their products are nice - full-featured and easy to use - but if it breaks, you're stuck with it and they don't live up to their warranty."
4,There's a problem!!!,"If you have one of these and you can only fit about 6-8 songs on this(I have had the same problem), don't go looking for another mp3player! You just have to buy a backpack 64mb or higher. If you don't have this problem, then I think this is a great mp3player! It has great sound(which you can customize) and it doesn't skip at all! If you are looking for a good mp3player at a good price, then this is it! It's Great!I guarruntee that of you buy this product with another backpack (64mb or highter), then you will think it is great also!"
2,Disappointed,"The unit was advertized with a $50 rebate offer; well, I never received my $50. The player is nice and simple, the sound quality will depend on your headphones. It runs on a single AA battery, and it eats them quickly. If I had known I would not receive the promised rebate, I would have gone with a Nomad. That's my advice."
2,So much for quality control...,"I would love to write a review of the performance of the Rio 600 MP3 player, however, I could not get mine to work. I purchased the product brand new and sealed in it's packaging. There was no slide switch for ON/OFF, so I had to package it back up, and am now attempting to return it.Just a note to beware of this product -- great price, but at the cost of flimsy construction? Maybe it's great, but I've seen multiple reviews to the contrary regarding durability and battery life."
4,A way to a man's heart is through words,"Marc Lacy's book, The Looking heart is a poetic lyrical materpiece. His words transport you to another dimension in your thoughts. Perceptive and straight from the heart, Marc's words of poetic eloquence eminates from a heart of a talented man who looks on the inside of the soul. This man's book will surely not take you, as one author stated, on False Roads To Manhood. For the poets out there, I found this book an insightful read for my pondering thoughts."
5,Touching...,"Marc's poetry is about a variety of societal issues that touch the heart through many expressions. Reading the poems makes you think, but listening to Marc perform them with so many emotions raises a whole new consciousness. And his family bond is quite apparent in his poetry."
5,These are very nice and comfortable shoes.,"I used these shoes for three years as my daily shoes during residency training in busy clinic/hospital where I would walk/Stand for several hours. After those three years, the shoes insoles were already worn so I added Dr Scholl's insoles to reinforce it. Yet the leather and the outside soles still maintained its crisp and unworn look. A lot of people would see these shoes and comment that my new shoes looked nice. They would be surprised when I tell them I have had them for years.Unfortunately, I have to move on with new shoes after using these for so long. But I am already very impressed and committed to Steve Madden shoes, so I am buying the Steve Madden Men's Nobyll Loafers. They look alike, but at least a bit different. I just ordered these and wanted to add a few lines in favor of my Novo shoes as a gratitude to a well built shoe. ""I will miss you good Novo."" Sob sob sob."
4,"Very good, nice shoes","I would have rated the shoes with 5 stars, but they run half a size larger than what I usually wear, besides that they are great."
2,NO GAME Inside,"I bought this game from Amazon Warehousedeals, As part of Amazon good service i thought i will receive a good package. However, once i opened the package everything (manual, receipt, case) was there EXCEPT the GAME...OMG, returning it and placing a new order, hopefully this time it will come complete."
5,Progresso Soup,"Sent this pack to my grandson in college, and he thought they were fantastic. No need to have cold storage, and he could have them at anytime day or night. Recommend for parents and grandparents as a ""little"" surprise for your kids in college."
5,Underrated masterpiece but remastered sound is the pits,"This is my favorite Pogues album (Red Roses is a close second) but does anybody share my opinion that some of these remasters really rob the music of a certain vital quality? To my ears it seems that by bringing each individual instrument into more enhanced clarity it robs the overall sound of it's cohesive buzz. I'm all for remastering and the bonus tracks are a tasty addition but on this album, Red Roses, and Peace and Love (also underrated in my opinion) they really do the music a disservice- wankers. Like I say, these are great for the bonus tracks but if you have the original masters my advice is to hang on to them. By the way- you don't need to be piss drunk to enjoy the Pogues."
3,The Riemann Hypothesis for non-mathematicians,"The book is really about the search for solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis, and contains lots of stories about mathematicians, and mathematical topics. It also includes a wide variety of tangential topics, such as the resolution of previously unsolved problems: the Bierbach Conjecture and Fremat's Last Theorem.While intended as an accessible account of the Riemann Zeta Function and the Riemann Hypothesis for the non-mathematician, it uses overly trite and simplistic descriptions of basic mathematical concepts such as prime numbers, complex numbers, and zeros of functions, while glossing over more advanced concepts, such as L-functions, Hilbert Spaces, and Random Matrices. Clearly, this was written by a mathematical novice."
4,Screen Protection,I spent my hard earned money on a Garmin GPSMap 60csx so I know that I would feel better to have the screen protected from being scratched.This product fits the bill. Just follow the directions(very easy) and you will have no problem. I know that it has been a help at least once from the screen being scratched.
3,Ok book...,"This book was OK, but not as good as another one I'd purchased. The book came in good shape though, and I am still glad I bought it."
3,"Good, if skimpy, collection","This disc includes works of two well-known American composers in good, though perhaps not the best available, performances. The Villa-Lobos guitar piece is also performed well, but seems rather in strange company. My main beef is the skimpiness of the material in terms of time (less than 50 minutes). Even for a bargain classical CD that little music seems kind of lame."
2,Hemingway in earnest,"The words in this book are scripted in black ink upon the pages and the pages of the book are white. The whiteness of the each page is light against the darker skin of the fingers of your hand as you turn the pages of this book after reading the words on each page. A white page might be stained with a dried brown puddle of coffee if you accidentally spill the coffee you drink in an effort to stay awake while reading this book. The ponderous oncoming words on the seemingly endless pages of this book flow ponderously as they keep coming on each page, white page after white page of script in black ink. Coffee is good and necessary for anyone who reads this book. Coffee, good and necessary, and lots of it."
3,Lack of Thought and Feeling,"Often times an author wishes to connect his readers to his characters and envelope the reader into the book making her unable to put the book down. I didnt get this here. I thought that Hemmingway did an excellent job in setting up the story line. However, I was not involved enough in the thoughts and expressions of his characters.The book was exceptionally well written as for its historical content and knowledge of Europe. It brings the country-side into the thoughts of the reader but I had trouble feeling the life and animations of the characters."
2,Hemingway was a great writer?! What?,"Shmoopy this. Shmoopy that. Too much shmoopy business. (Pages and pages of it.) Less shmoopy, less drinking detàils and more gore, then I'd give it 4 stars."
2,A Farewell To Arms,"Our book club wanted to read this as our ""Classics"" book this year. Hemingway is considered an American iconic writer and based on critics they thought this his best writing. We were not impressed. To many repetitive lines, boring and dull were some of the comments! And they found the main character to narcissistic. We're wondering if we shouldn't have picked A Sun Also Rises instead."
4,Love and War,"Ernest Hemingway writes a great story about love and war. It takes place durring World War 1, about a young man named Frederic Henry. Frederic is an American citizen who is serving in the Italian army. While he is near the Austria-Hungry border he falls for a girl by the name of Catherine Barkley. Catherine is a nurse at an American hospital and when Frederic was wounded in the war he was sent to her hospital. The more time he spent there the more serious the realtionship gets. When he was healed he returns to war where things go wrong so Frederic tries to flea from the Italians in search of Catherine. The book gets better as you go on as your emotions are always changing. I recomend it to anyone who likes love stories or anything to do with war."
4,Fantastic Novel,"This is a fantastic novel that is very easy to get into. Hemmingway's short, descriptive sentences offer a style uncanny to any other's and they clash very effectively with his seemingly endless sections of solid naration between characters.The story itself is absolutely astonishing but is almost forgotten amongst the overwhelming love story between Catherine and le Tenente. I found myself, having finished the novel, looking back on what had happened to the tenente and realizing it had all passed while I was only worried about Catherine. An absolute masterpiece by Hemmingway.My only problem was that the novel was written so close to the end of WWI that Hemmingway simply assumes the reader is familiar with the geography and the history of the war. I found myself having to refer to a map periodically and looking up other WWI events on the internet as the happened in the book.None the less, this is a can't miss novel!!"
3,Not All That I Remembered,"A Farewell to Arms is a sentimental downer, reread after the onset of adulthood. It's a tale from which teenagers can learn depressing and disorienting notions of heroism and futility. This is the very same edition I read in the late 1950s, when I was a teenager. I liked it moderately well then, though I thought it was affected and manneristic in style. I've liked it less every time I've looked at it since, but it is the best of H's novels and will continue to excite new readers into the foreseeable future. I hope they will be wise enough to see through the mystique."
3,Insightful but stilted,"This book is worth the read, especially if you're they kind of person who has trouble with words more than two syllables long. I liked Hemingway's method of character analysis, finding it particularly refreshing after slogging though jigsaw-puzzle-esque writing by Faulkner. But the diolague sometimes left a little to be desired. Reread the conversation when Catherine tells Frederick she's pregnant and you'll see what I mean. But overall the book's ok."
3,A Farewell to Legs,"As the first hemmingway piece I have read, AFTA was interesting and entertaining at some parts, banal and boring at others. Though it combines a captivating love story and the Great War in Europe, I found the novel leaving me alittle flat at parts. I enjoyed many of the characters int he novel, such as the super-stud Rinaldi and the young, confused priest. However, after Book 3 of the novel, we lose some of the more entertaining characters and are barraged with less-described figures. The dialogue in the story was also a bit distasteful in its simplicity, and I found myself confused at parts becasue I had read it too fast. But the simple text also allows the book to move a bit smoother at parts as well. Overall, AFTA was a relatively entertaining novel, despite its flaws. If you enjoyed it, I would suggest reading otehr Hemmingway pieces. If not, read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I bought this book thinking it was going to look like the product in the images. I am was wrong. The book, is green with weird gold designs on it. Not what I was expecting or what I wanted. False advertising."
1,A disappointing novel,"A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is a dreadfully boring novel. The characters Catherine and Frederick, are mindless nits wrapped up in their love affair, while enlisted in World War I. I thought the book lacked a single intelligent thought throughout its contents.To me a good book is one that is thought provoking and makes one think, and when coming near the end gets a feeling as if they had befriended the characters. In a Farewell to Arms, the only thing I thought about was the frivolity of the characters and how they were devoid of any verisimilitude. I only wished that the end would come quicker so I wouldn't have to read another drawn out conversation on the reassurance of their love for another. I strongly urge any reader of books on compassion and intelligence to stray from opening A Farewell to Arms."
4,Farewell to arms,Such a delightfully story about war and characters involved in the story. A flawless writing . Joy to read. It is a beautifully written novel by probably the best American writer
5,A Book of life and death,"Ernest Hemingway beautifully manages to take us through the ordeals a young man experiences in life. I am 14 and recently my dad past away, and as I read the book I was touched and amazed by Hemingway description of death. Especially at the end I found it impossible not to commiserate with narrator's ordeal with death."
1,Where are the emperor's clothes?,"I looked forward to reading this book but was very disappointed by its plodding clipped style. The dialogue between the 2(poorly developed) main characters is tedious and uninspired. The well touted passages about life at the front seemed to bog down in the mud that was being described. Maybe reading S-Faulk's ""Birdsong"" first, raised the bar of my expectations too high?"
3,a feminine viewpoint,"An obvious jagged line of disagreement pervaded my AP Liturature class after reading this book: the boys seemed to love it, and the girls hate it. For one thing, Hemingway writes action. No sentiment, no pity, no abstract ideas, no emotion allowed, only the brutal physical truth of war and of love. The storyline revolves around the (naturally) physical relationship between an American ambulance driver Frederick Henry and the British nurse Catherine. The book showed a horribly dark side to love and life that I had never considered before, but I'm afraid that Hemmingway's laconic style, along with his assumption that the reader knew exactly what the author ment, bothered me. 30% of the book is dialogue, and the dialouge is mostly monosylables. Thumbs up to subject, thumbs down to style. I'll stick to Fitzgerald."
2,"OK, but certainly not worthy of being called a classic","I read this in high school and now again as an adult in my mid-40s. I am baffled that critics call this a classic (and I was a lit major). The characters lack any complexity, the story has little dramatic tension, and the characters' development is not insightful or even interesting. There are extended conversational passages that lead nowhere and just communicate the main emotion of the book: an ennui--perhaps caused by war, perhaps by the main character's own alienated personality.The only part that really had some insight and even tension(hence the two stars) is the first third in which Hemingway describes war itself and the sensation of being badly injured. This is clearly autobiographical and is much more alive than there rest of the book--after that, it's all predictable and uninteresting."
4,Worth reading,"A great story that captures the true brutality and unforgivingness of war, as well as finding love in the middle of one. This book has a good mix of simplicity and complexity, in terms of the plot and Hemingway's symbols and metaphors. It is an overall good book, and one worth reading."
3,Readable but not astonishing,"I consider this book a must to every well educated, intelligent person, however, you have to push yourself towards it. Considering Hemingway an author who isn't easy to read, this is his standard. The description of war is better than the description of love between the two.At many points it seemed too shallow and you have to use all your imagination to be able to picture it."
4,Not as good as Goldstein,"This book is a good classical mechanics text inasmuch as alot of physics is conveyed to the reader, for example the intoduction argument for the existance of the Lagrangian is very nice. However, alot of mathematical arguements in the book are based on too much physical intuition and too little rigor. I believe that applied mathematicians (not having the usual undergrad physics background) and anyone more interested in a rigorous treatment of classical mechanics would be better served by Goldsteins text."
1,The Kindle Edition of this Great Book is Scandalously Produced,"This book is of course one of the great classics of modern physics. The equations are completely unreadable (miniscule print) on a Kindle. They are barely readable on Kindle for PC, if you set the screen resolution to very low.If you must read this electronically, I suggest takeing notes by hand, rewriting all the equations."
2,"Terrible ""best of"" for a really funny person.","I really don't like this ""best of"" because I can't stand that they included clips and montages instead of the entire skit at times. The skits that Farley was in were absolutely hilarious, and you'll want to watch the entire thing but you won't be able to on this DVD. I'm a huge fan of Farley and just thought that this collection was only ok, maybe for someone who likes Farley and just wants a basic reminder of how funny he was. I wish a longer and more complete SNL Best Of would come out. As somebody said earlier a volume 2 would be great, especially if the skits weren't dissected so much. It reminds me of an E special of best of SNL, where they only show 5 seconds of the skit they say is great."
2,"Comme ci, comme ca.","This DVD was just so-so. There were a few skits that were funny, but the physical comedy thing wore on me. His shtick was that he was morbidly obese, which is not funny. I wish I had never bought it. It was a waste of money and a waste of my time."
4,Love the power of 18 volts,"The 18 Volt Drill/Driver is a real powerhouse. It gets a little heavy when used for extended time but, when power is needed, it is the portable drill to use. I wish the battery life was longer but we all would wish that for all batteries. Great product."
3,"Works well enough, but time they moved on","These work well enough, for ten years ago they work fine, but technology has moved on and this branch of Black and Decker hasn't. They need to get with the plan and provide a more modern battery technology like other premium priced manufacturers."
2,DeWalt inferior to Makita; MaxTool DoubleBilled me!,"I have had many cordless Makita drills for probably almost 15 years, and only ever had one battery expire in that time!! I bought a DeWalt set this time because it had so many different cordless tools I wanted, and because several guys I know who use their drills a lot, recommended them.Big Mistake! The original 3 batteries only lasted one to two years!! This is my last DeWalt Tool purchase. I was spoiled with Makita batteries. Even leaving them in my garage in boiling Phoenix, AZ summers, they last years and years and don't fail.I bought the two battery set thru Amazon from MaxTool. Then a few weeks after receiving the batts, MaxTool sent me a bill! so I had to contact Amazon to get email verification that they had paid the vendor, then relay the information to MaxTool. It was really a hassle. MaxTool says it is taken care of, but time will tell. I won't buy from MaxTool again if they are going to try to double-dip me ..."
5,dependable as always,"Sometimes I could find these on sale for a pair for $99, but I hadn't seen them for that in some time, so looked them on on the internet. I've had DeWalt brand tools for many years, and have used this kind of battery most of the time. I always got 4 years out of them, when I was in the remodeling business. Plenty of power at a good price."
4,Good Product,"These perform as advertised, are a good price, easy to use, durable, I would recomend them to anyone needing these."
1,New and no good,Bought a pack of two and tried to charge. It will charge as a shallow charge only. I tried on 4 different charges. They all charge about the same. Now I have to pay to send them back foe warranty. blah
5,Great Lasting Power!,"I received the pair of batteries, charged them both and they worked as good as when my drill was new 5 years ago. They both hold the charge for days. I did later find them at Home Depot for $10 less - and I don't believe it was a sale. They used to be about $80 a piece at Ace Hardware.Prof. B"
1,Dewalt 18v batteries,"I have many cordless tools. I find Makita batteries far better than Dewalt. The last Dewalt 18v, 2.4a battery I bought lasted 3 months. The remaining battery holds a good charge for a short time. When it dies, I'll through away the tool it came with and buy another Makita. Don't buy Dewalt batteries. They are almost as bad as Craftsman. Dewalt batteries get zero stars from me. I also have Dewalt corded tools. They all work fine."
4,They live as long as they should,"I wasn't going to bother to write a review for a couple of replacement power cells, until I saw some of the other opinions, here. I am very pleased with all the DeWalt equipment I use. The batteries do a fine job of powering everything except the circular saw - that one lacks guts.I used my original power cells for a couple of years before they died of old-age and recharging. I am confident that they lasted for the number of rechargings that DeWalt promises. I followed the guidelines, and only occasionally hit the reconditioner button on the charging cycle. The people who get such short lives out of these power cells may not be bothering to use that feature of their DeWalt charger.Yes, I am pleased with these replacements. They work well, and are the genuine DeWalt parts. Yes, I've had a really good experience with these power cells. Yes, I'd recommend them."
5,MrGolf,"I have owned my DeWalt power tools for 9 years and they still work great. The batteries had died, but these two new ones work great. I would highly recommend the DEWALT tools to everyone. The new battery is working good, charged and ran tools for hours."
5,12 volt batteries,"I've had a De-Walt 12 volt xrp drill for 3 years. This drill has kept going and going including the batteries. The batteries are excellent. Finally, one battery has lost some power retention, but these batteries really last."
1,no illustrations - disappointed,"I'm very disappointed that this book does not have the illustrations. It says ""illustration"" where the illustrations should be. The description I read about the book did not say that there weren't going to be illustrations and you have to actually click ""look inside the book"" and go to the first story to see that the illustrations are missing. I think that even the authro would be highly disappointed with the lack of illustrations as he considered them to be very important when teaching history to young children."
4,"Fun Game, Doesn't Like Vista or 7","This is one of my favorite strategy games. I was disaponted when I upgraded ot Vista and then to Windows 7, this game is playable, but barely on those systems. It might play fine via XP Mode on Windows 7 Pro, Enterprise, or Ultimate, but have not tried it."
4,A camp classic that brings back many fun childhood memories!,"I used to watch this movie religiously as a child and like the classic STAR TREK, it is still entertaining. My five year old godson loves it as well. For Bat-Fans, it is no dark knight, but is still very fun to watch. It also answers that age old question-""just how do they put on the costumes while sliding down the batpoles?"" That answer alone is worth this video and is answered in the first five minutes. WHEN WILL THE ENTIRE TV SERIES BE RELEASED ON VIDEO???!!!!"
3,Not watched often,The video was purchased for a five year old who loves Batman and Cat Woman. I will admit the video has been watched less than five times though a recent obsession of my son is wrestling. The video may recirculate through once this phase hopefully goes by quickly.
4,"The Bat-spray, ladder, fan club helicopter! Oh my god.","Na na na na na na Batman! Im back and ready for this movie featuring the second caped crusader (Adam was not the first). In this movie there are four villians. The Riddler played by the late Frank Gorshin, Catwoman played by Lee Meriwether, Penguin played by Burgess Meredith, and the Joker played by Cesar Romero. Batman played by Adam West and Robin played by Burt Ward are great in this classic campy movie. This movie is overacting at its best. Its great and will be great in your Batman collection. I assure you, you will not be disappointed. Next time Ill be reviewing Batman the animated series season 1. POW! WHAP! GONE!"
5,It was great! The action and the POW BAP PLOP were all fun,I think .... I know this is the best Batman ever made. I just wisht they put the episodes onto video with the movie! The acting was excellent. Frank Gorshinn's Riddler laugh sends chills up your spine.
4,Batman- Men In Tights...,"Yepper, it's all here: the day-glo colors, the ultra-ridiculous plotline, the joyously evil villans including Joker (Cesar Romero), Riddler (Frank Gorshin), Penguin (Burgess Merideth), and Catwoman (Luscious Lee Meriwether), and of course Batman / Bruce Wayne (Adam West) and Robin / Dick Grayson (Burt Ward). In this epic we have the four terrors of Gotham kidnapping delegates of the UW (United World). They've turned them into piles of dust with their dehydrator gun! Can the dynamic duo save the delegates in time? Can the nasty ne'erdowells be stopped? Will they all be forced to do the bat-usi? Don't touch that remote! This is Batman as he was in the swingin' 60s, cape, mask, bodystocking and all! I loved it. My only complaint is that it could have been a little shorter. I kept waiting for those commercial interruptions..."
2,Batman - The Movie Review,But this for my kids and it was the most boring movie I have ever watched.The shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie.
2,Bad memories from the past.,"The Batman TV series are actually awful. It simply does not fit to Batman such campiness. If it was Spider-Man, I would say OK. Spidey is already campy in the comics. But Batman is, you know, dark, gothic. The Tim Burton films depicted him perfectly. But this... the performances of the actors make Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura look serious. The bat-gadgets have an awful design. The suits would deserve Anti-Oscars... Anyway, if you are a 'serious' Batman fan avoid this film. It is NOT Batman. It is a bitter parody of the Bat. END"
5,Christmas Present,"This was a surprise Christmas present for our 5 year old grandson from his Pop Pop. A year ago, when the child was 4, we accidentally found this old movie on TV and the little boy adored it. He watched it 3 times in a row! He is a huge Batman fan. So now he has his own copy to watch when he wants. He loves the ""real people' much more than the cartoons. There is no violence in this movie. It is perfect for a small child."
5,There's Only One Batman!!!,"There's only one Batman, & this is it!! If not for Adam West & Co., the comic book industry & the super hero movie genre would not be what it is today.The contemporary Batman films have merit, but they take themselve way too seriously, & they're getting progressively creepy IMO.This is fun, colorful & clever eye candy, a high point of 1960's pop culture. If you disagree, I'm sorry...I guess you had to be there."
5,Never Ceases to Amaze Me,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres. This movie never ceases to amaze me. Although the TV series was intended for youths, it did very well in the ratings amoungst adults - including myself ater it went into sydnication. I bought this DVD a few weeks ago and I still laugh at this campy movie. The DVD includes an additional track on the movie that a person can turn on that has Adam West and Burt Ward doing an audio commentary. Although I am much older now I still laugh at the silliness of this movie. Is there anything that Batman does not carry in his utility belt. And shark repellant (and other unlikely sprays) in a helicopter? There's something you don't see every day but I strong recommend seeing this movie."
3,High-Camp Revival,"Since the original episodes remain unavailable on DVD, the 1966 theatrical version of the classic TV series is the next best thing. ""Batman"" remains nostalgic, colorful fun with Adam West and Burt Ward as the satiric Dynamic Duo. The villains and Bat-gadgets are given a more generous budget while the production design is quite impressive. The DVD special edition features a beautiful widescreen transfer and loads of extras - not to mention an enjoyable audio commentary by Adam and Burt. It's ""Swinging Sixties"" pop culture at an affordable price."
3,A must see for all Bat Fans!,"It's great to see this film being re-released on video. I hadn't seen it in years and it's just as funny as I remember. Having all four villians (Joker, Riddler, Penguin, and Catwoman) plotting against the Dynamic Duo was a great idea. Lee Meriwether is O.K. as Catwoman, but Julie Newmar is missed. Watch for all the new Bat Gadgets and vehicles created for the film. And the gags don't get any better...""Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb"". END"
5,What can I say,"This video is awsome. The videos that are MTV never shows are on here. The backstage footage is also sweet. Trust me, it can't be better than this. Marilyn Manson rules"
3,Needs to be fitted before using it.,"This product is more for a luther or a handy person than for average people because you need to trim it down to the correct size then sand it and add the indentations where the violin strings rest before you can set up on a violin. Although the wood is beautiful, this bridge requires too much work to be worth buying. If you need a new bridge for your violin, just get a fitted one, even if you have to spend more."
5,Fantastic,Great sequel! The Terri/Ricky thing was a great add. Dinka and Eddie had great parts. Cedric hilarious as always and Kenan Thompson showing up was hilarious. If you liked the first one definately see this one... try to avoid Beauty Shop though...
2,okay>? what happened>?,"the barbershop series is kind of a downgrade.... the first one was HI-larious.... th second one was kind of a lackluster.... no funny funny like the first movie.... i dont blame the cast one bit, it is america and how offended people can get... people in america take things way too serious....its a movie it is not real!!! they are all jokes.... that is what happend to the 2nd movie they tried to keep it tame... i could see if the movies switched places but it did not happen.the funniest parts actually came from kenan thompson (from kenan and kel on nickelodeon and SNL) he was mad funny.... AND queen latifah. the only part in the movie i was looking forward to was the bar-b-que when queen latifah and cedric the entertainer's characters . they could have ranaway with that scene and made the movie a classic but that scene was way weak...if you have not seen the 2nd movie DO NOT expect anything more than brady bunch humour..."
3,Weaker than the previous movie...,"This movie is one of those reasons why every successful movie doesn't have to have a sequel. It's almost a given nowadays that a movie will have a sequel if it makes money. Barbershop 2 is mediocre. The story is weak and the moral decision making of Ice Cube was played on in the last film, so in a way it's a remake of the first, just rearranged a bit. The one saving grace of this movie is Queen Latifa. Every show and movie she's in seems to shine from her presence. I could've done without the white guy trying to act like a black guy. That kinda thing just annoys me more than anything. I would've still watched the film regardless of the white guy (I'm caucasian) because I find some black comedies funny. I suggest watching the Friday sequels instead of this."
4,Not quite as good as the original,"This is a worthy sequal, full of the laughs, humor, and emotion of the original. However it still lacks in other areas, such as a poor, sudden, conclusion; and a slow start.The storyline of this movie is fairly close to that of the original. One of the last mainstays of Americana, the corner barbershop, is being threatened by big developers who want to put a chain store across the street. Barbershop 2, however, is less about the story and more about the characters. And the characters are truly larger then life. You will fall in love with each of them and their idiosyncracies. They all return from the original, and that's the main reason this move gets an above average review.It started slow but quickly picked up steam. I was suprised by the sudden ending, however, and would have preferred that it continue for at least another ten minutes. Overall, though, a good movie well worth seeing."
4,Funny,"This and the first movie are on the same level to me. This has a little more story but the jokes in the first movie was better. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. The same cast, Watch it on a slow day and you'll cheer up."
2,Barber Shop 2,This movie wasn't very funny and I really didn't like Cedric's character.Half of the time you couldn't understand what he was saying.He was talking like he had marbles in his mouth.Some people might find that funny but I thought it was just annyoing.The best person in the cast was Quenn Latifah and unfortunatly her role wasn't that big.She was great in Beauty Shop though.I suggest you see that movie instead.
4,"where's ""help wanted""/","disappointed pilot episode was missing after buying it specifically because someone said it was included in the 1st season set.otherwise,it's a good compilation.my daughter angelina likes it."
3,Good stuff,"Okay, i love this show. But, it does get annoying, so i deducted one star. I also noticed that the first season does not include the best episode of anything ever, ""Sailor Mouth"". So i deducted one point..It doesn't really matter what i think cause if you love Spongebob, you're gonna buy this anyway."
1,not happy,I was not happy when i relized my granddaughter had gotten ahold of my kindle which she never uses and bought this. Item. When I went into it to try to cancel it I couldn't. So now I have sponge Bob on my kindle and no one watches it. What a waste of money.
3,spongebobsquare pants complete 1st season,"i order this at 30.00 and on of the disc skips which i didn't think was fair as my 3 yr old loves spongebob i couldn't send it back, as she watches it everyday, so i try to hide this disc so i don't have to hear her say it stopped nana"
5,A pleasurable and captivating read.,"This Cradleland books are a must read for those committed to Fantasy novels with a Christian embrass. Mr. Hirt is masterful at using many of the literary techniques such as personification, anthropomorphism, metaphor and others. The story is also believable and the characters interact with effective dialogue as well as interpersonal relationships. Another nice feature is the short chapters. Most of the chapters aren't so long that you have to put your bookmark in mid-stream. You can quickly move through the story, yet find convenient stopping points. You won't be disappointed, buy and enjoy."
2,Disappointed!,"This item was a disappointment because it was much smaller and lighter than I expected. For the price I expected a more substantial chain and pendant....had it been priced appropriately, about 50% less, I would've expected what I got and would've avoided it as a gift."
5,Pure Ecstacy.,"I love watching Midsomer Murders.I love the English Countryside, love looking at the cottages and homes, and the beautiful flower gardens. I am never disappointed in any story. I love John Nettles, he plays DCI Inspector Barnaby Jones so well. I love that the show uses a lot of the older actors who are just great. As soon as my dvd starts to play, I am immediately transported to the Midsomer villages and am totally absorbed in what is taking place. I wish one of our tv stations would carry this show. I just can't get enough of it.Joan Ilgen"
2,I confused these shorts with the other Russel Athletic Shorts,"These ones have no pockets! A small gripe in comparison to the following.. I purchased five different colors of these shorts at the same time and they were all delivered together. The problem is that they are all different sizes of the same size, if you get my meaning. When I order LG, I want them all to be LG, regarless of what the label says. I have some that go down the my knees, others that are 4-6 inches above the knee.. No consistancy at all. They were made in a couple different countries (El Salvador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic to be exact),but measurements should be the same everywhere (I thought)."
5,Amazon Kicks @$$!!!,"I'd just like to start this out by saying,""Yes this item fits super redhawk, redhawk and gp100 model rugers as they are all interchangeable, I have all 3"". As for me and amazon,I simply love this relationship we share, I give them a little amount of money and they give me great service and quality merchandise!"
4,Great visibility,"I love my Ruger GP100, but shooting in an indoor range against a black backdrop was tough with the factory front blade sight. This HiViz sight was a snap to install, and it has hugely improved the sight picture on my revolver."
5,Isaac is god,Personally I LOVE this record. Isaac Hayes really is brilliant! Nothing I've ever heard compares to this. I can just feel the passion in his songs and the lyrics really make my eyes wet. This is truly a masterpiece wich I think everyone should own. Great work Isaac!Also I would like to point out the following:Isaac seems to be god. In his hits like 'Misty' and 'Rock me baby' the background vocalists seem to mumble. But when played backwards they appear to be saying 'He who follows me will live forever for I am god'
5,"The ""BIBLE"" of Graffiti...'nuff said!!!","SUBWAY ART does not only inspires a new generation of""Graffiti Artist"",but also shows that Graffiti IS an ART..all in it's own.It can not be taught,it is a self taught art that has been greatly overlooked...once the book is read you will have a different look at the""Underground Art"""
3,wrong cd,"Your listing the tracks for ""Hells Ditch"", not ""Waiting for Herb"". Yopu won't sell to many that way. Want to know bonus tracks for cd listed as ""Waiting for Herb"""
3,Sam's biography,"Interesting; a little too detailed for my taste, especialy at the beginning. Being from Texas, I found it easy to relate to many of the places mentioned. Relating to material makes for a good read for me."
4,Solid.,"I got a presale of this CD before it came out. I was a little hesitant at first because I didn't recognize the name. CD1 is subtle but get's ya, kinda like the first cd of Digweed's Bedrock. CD2 blew me out of the water. It starts out hard, and keeps pumpin. Im hoping I will be able to see him live soon."
5,"Great art, a classic for every toddler","Somehow I missed this when I was a kid. It is a pleasure to share this story with our son. Great art, not to many words, a perfect bedtime story."
2,Non-Linear Bore,"If you are a fan of non-linear storytelling ala Crash, you may enjoy I AM.A snobby heiress is diagnosed with cancer and wants to be frozen in cryogenics. Her brother is willed the family fortune if she dies before turning 50. She's 49.A detective is on a vengeance search for the doctor who killed his wife during an experiment.A once-famed rocker has become a shell of a man after his son is tragically killed in an accident.The future Los Angeles District Attorney is squeaky clean until he learns about his girlfriend's past.All of these storylines connect within this film. There are some nice twists and small surprises but overall, the movie is very slow. It may have made a good made-for-tv movie with the commercials breaking up the boring story.Having said that, I AM was made to show to non-Christians. Throughout the film, they project one of the Ten Commandments and you realize how each character is breaking them.Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and an intense scene."
1,"Review "" I AM""",I purchased this movie upon the advice of a friend and was highly disappointed in the film.I could not make myself watch it after the first few minutes of the beginning.Truly a poor production.
1,This is not the one Oprah recommended,What a mistake. Saw Oprah and wanted to order DVD. The one she recommened wasn't released until Jan 2012. Don't buy this one it was a MISTAKE.
3,Reqired text,The text has an array of details referring to adolescent development. Not a subject I enjoy reading about... but if you do than I highly recommend it!
4,Shakespearean?,"Overall the movie was a good movie. But if your'e going to steel Shakespear's play, then you must make the movie exactly the same. Otherwise the movie looses it's intrigue. The characters acted out their parts efficiently, but not extrordinarily. This was certainly not the best movie I have ever seen. It just takes too much away from the legendary play, The Tempest, by Shakespeare."
4,Insightful about power and domination,"This was a very academic book about women's rights, women's power and the thought process of power and domination. It was very insightful and helpful for me to understand my relationship with women."
2,Far from five stars,"I bought this movie based on all the glowing five-star reviews (and based on the fact that I am desperate for more great period pieces). Well, this is not a great period piece. It is better than Berkeley Square, for instance, but is nothing near the level of Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters. The acting is good, the scenery is wonderful, but the script is only average (and sometimes poor). The story is bleak with no real pay-off, like Dickens without the humor or the subtlety. There is nothing more annoying than unrealistic or manufactured tragedy (think Jude the Obscure), and this story is in that line. If you can find the DVD on sale, it might be worth wasting a rainy night with, but I doubt it is one you will want to watch over and over."
3,Disappointing,"If you've already studied all of the Gouldian Finch information on the Web, and now you're looking for a resource that will be more comprehensive and authoritative, then this is NOT the book for you. A simple Google search will easily unearth more information, and the Gouldians you will read about on the Web are far more robust than the seemingly suicidal birds described in this little volume. In fairness to the author, I'll add that this book was published in 1991, and much of the information on the Web was probably extrapolated from this author's pioneering work.A more petty grievance about this book is that the author deserved better editing by his publisher. Someone should have renovated all of the awkward sentences, the possessives without apostrophes, and the outright errors, such as where we're instructed to PALPITATE (instead of PALPATE) a bird's belly."
5,Mas Amedda,"This creepy guy is one of Palpatines major domos and he is alos one of my favorite figures. He goes great with a sly moore and Chancellor Palpatine figure! He has a base, staff and his tounge he uses to express agitation. I would totally recomend this figure!"
2,What The DUKE!!!!!,"First off I'd like to say. I played in STAR WARS REVENGE OF SID I mean SITH I played a Wookie. Not the big one the other big one. The toy was not LIFE SIZED it would have to be at least 3-7 times bigger then the one I recieved from looks. In the movie, my staff was more flexible and was more like a trident then the one on the figurines poster card. The Flagmestationism within the tongueular vascular expressionism tells us his contusisms is burning like blue fire for desire. HE NEEDS A CHEST PLATE, MASK and GLOSSY BOOTS.Thats all I have to say to you"
1,Terrible service,"I placed two orders and one arrived and one didn't... claiming a missing address. How could that be possible if one of the packages got there? I never got the product, so I can't review it."
3,Interesting the first viewing,"This video was interesting to watch the first time, but if I had it to do over again, I would have rented rather than purchased. Not good enough to own IMHO."
3,3D Rip Off but Christopher Lee is great,"I purchased this DVD because it was a IMAX program presented in 3D. The packaging also includes the 2D version on the same disk as the program is short..only about 39 mins. But both the 3D and 2D seem to be the same you can watch the 3D without glasses. I thought it was a manufacturing defect and emailed the company through the web site, no response. The photography is great and the program is quite good with Christopher Lee's low voice sounding great in such a mysterious subject. But it is a 3D rip off....buy it as a 2D program."
3,Decent,"This IMAX film reminded me of a children's film. It was very simple and easy to follow - perhaps too simple. The depth and complexity of Ancient Egyptian culture and their mummies seems to have been swept away in this one. It was a blend of reenactments, and some storytelling, without the straightforward scientific/historical documentary approach that I prefer. Still, Ancient Egypt is fascinating. The part that upset me the most was learning how the Abd el Rasoul family broke into tombs and sold off antiques - such precious knowledge and historical culture lost! I am so glad the Egyptian Antiquities Service was able to uncover the location of the pharaohs' tombs and preserve an important part of Egypt's heritage."
2,I find this book hard to understand,"I found this book hard to understand. I spent couple of hours ploughing through the first few chapters soon as I got the book from Amazon. I don't know if it's me or what? But the sentence structure and the way the author put it. It seems that I sometimes couldn't fathom what she wanted to express. Maybe my English is not good enough for this. However, after I browse one of her work ""who's Irish,"" I found it's comprehensible. Is there anyone who can give me an explanation. I'd appreciate it."
3,the shining did it better,"Three stars only because I loved Shaun Pertwee from ""Dogsoldiers"" he was still playing a sexy menace towards what ever was menacing. But it is really two stars after Pertwee began to look possessed because all I could think was how Jack Nicholson did it better in ""The Shining"".The point of marshes or even supernatural genres is they are supposed to emit a miasma ; noxious fumes that warn there is no smoke without fire and confirm suspicion before a worse suspicion of dread of horrors to come even death. But the plot moves too fast.. Never mind smoke the fire extinguishers are squeezing and Pertwee's gravelly voice seems to echo red rum red rum wish I was watching red rum......"
2,Not What I Expected,"First lemme say that I was a huge 112 fan, but this album doesn't live up to expectations at all. The only worthy songs on this album are Dance With Me and Peaches and Cream, and to be honest, even they are repetitive and below 112's level. My advice is ditch this CD and pick up their self-titled 112 album."
4,The Great 112 Returns and Does Not Disappoint,Excellent CD. Great tunes to grove and relax to while listening. Definitely worth the money for any 112 fan--thought you will probably have to skip a few tracks on this CD.
5,I like it,"I really like 112, so I was excited to pick up their new CD. I was not disappointed. I don't particularly care for the up beat tracks such as 'Peaches & Cream' and 'Dance with Me', but I thoroughly ejoyed all the other tracks. Ironically, though, my favorite song is the interlude called 'Q, Mike, Slim, Daron'. I also really like 'Still In Love'. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Tight CD,This CD is hot. Really enjoyed tracks like 'Dance With Me' 'Its Over Now' 'Peaches and Cream' 'All I want' and the interlude 'Q Mike Slim and Darron'.Good to get you in the mood for night out on the town.
5,5 STARS,THIS ALBUM IS OFF THE HOOK IT IS SO GOOD THAT I CAN LISTEN TO IT ALMOST BACK TO BACK.MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD IS SMILE IT IS LIKE WHEN YOU MAD AT YOUR MAN OR WOMEN YOU CAN JUST TURN ON THIS SONG AND YOU AND BOO LISTEN TO THE WORDS AND YALL CAN BECOME THE WAY YOU WERE BEFORE. SO IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD PLEASE GO OUT AND GET .
4,"Hold your body close, you on top of me",CAN YOU FEEL IT?...That's the one track that stick out in my head(maybe because radio has me burn out on peaches and cream)But this one song alone will get you the drawz if you work it right :)Anyway the rest of the cd is cool but 112 still haven't topped their first cd (I mean cupid just don't lie)But if you are a true 112 fan you will love this cd like the rest of them.And I will amitt the get my vote for not mixing the fast and slow songs together (nothing like getting your freak on then searching for the remote to skip tracks)But it has the true 112 flava that your looking for. Even though I really like them there is so much *new* music out right now that I din't really bump this this one for long. But that just my thoughts.Shalom.
4,Excellent piece of work,"I think 112 really did it this time, it's an album well produced and with some interesting beats. i just didn't give a 5 because in all 14 musics(excluding intros) i found only 7 or 6 great songs...., but those best songs are really amazing, like: It's over now; peaches & Cream; Dance With Me; don't Hate Me(5 stars); Sweet Love(5 stars), and some more..., i recommend buying this cd, it is really worth it!!!"
3,Vague,"This book covers the brosd spectrum of material science one would expect from an intro level materials class. The book is not valuable as a reference because it has a poor index. The chapter review questions on design are very vague and open ended. If you are looking for a reference book, look elswhere. If you need this for a class then I hope you have a good teacher."
3,only a reference,"Do NOT pay more than 75 CENTS for this book. No one wants it because it is outdated and its in one of those book lines that gets completely updated each year. Thus, all previous editions are barely worth the paper and binding."
4,Better than one might assume,"I was pleasantly surprised by this double feature DVD. Particularly with the Glove which is a solid entry in the Private Eye genre. I liked its realism and unromantic presentation of the everyday life of a bounty hunter. John Saxon fits the part perfectly and delivers a solid performance. Joanna Cassidy (who laughs less than usual) is also very good as the bounty hunter's fleeting love interest. I also thought that the avenger with the inhuman riot glove, played by Roosevelt Grier, was an interesting and memorable character as he has a friendly and maybe even chivalrous side. He reminded me a little of Forrest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai."
1,"Part of the problem, not the solution","Uninspired Saturday-Night-at-the-Improv riffs on obvious targets. The food at Red Lobster is homogenized, breaded 'n fried swill? New age music sucks? Wow, good thing we have a certified, published critic to inform us."
1,"Red Lobster, White Trash, Blue Lagoon","This is a smug, elitist book filled with hateful comments about others. What is the point? What good does it do the world to spread such cynical views? Unlike Sedaris and Bryson who also take jabs at popular culture, Queenan is pompous and without humor. It would be better if the author kept such mean-spirited diatribes to himself. Or better yet, perhaps he should read some Charles Karault and try to appreciate those are not as ""cultured"" as he is."
2,"could have been better, disappointed",This book had the chance to be funny and it was for about half a chapter then it became repetetive and boring. I would read something else from the author just to give him another chance to see if he really is that snobby and self-absorbed of a person.
3,"It was better the first time when it was called ""Bad"".","I liked this book better the first time, when it was called ""BAD: The Dumbing of America"" by Paul Fussell. The book is basically just recycled observations, even if many are dead on. Joe's just not as funny as he was when he was writing for Spy Magazine. Perhaps he got food poisoning eating at Red Lobster or listened to too many Billy Joel songs?"
1,Just terrible,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a witty critique of low brow American culture. Well, it wasn't witty and it wasn't a critique. It was a worthless tirade from a bitter, effete, ineffectual snob. Perhaps if Queenan was capable of producing something meaningful, he wouldn't feel compelled to be so cruel."
3,"Starts off strong, meanders away from his strengths","There are at least a dozen audible laughs in this book. That's not a bad average for 188 pages with generous margins. But most of them are in the first 75 of those pages.And I nearly choked every time I read where he used Elvis Costello as an example of the best in our culture. That's right, Costello. Not Presley. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz."
4,Wickedly Funny,"Wickedly funny account of satirist Joe Queenan's year-long sampling of of the dregs of American culture. Red Lobster, John Tesch, Planet Hollywood, ""Cats,"" and almost everything on television, are savaged.At times, however, Queenan comes off as the bitter kid who always got picked last for gym class, venturing into Eric Bogosian, (anyone who doesn't live in the village and wear black is worthless) territory.Some folks, Joe, just do not have a lot of money or education, and have never been exposed to the finer things of life. Maybe a night at the Sizzler is the best they can do."
1,This book sucks,"I heard a radio interview with the author and thought that his quips about popular culture would be the icing on the cake of a much more substantial, humerous book. The radio interview was like a movie preview that contains all the decent parts of a bad movie. What I found on reading the book were too many conclusory ""this sucks"" remarks. You can get this kind of analysis on any junior high school playground.Queenan taking on Red Lobster, Kenny G, John Tesh and Cats is like shooting fish in a barrel. I wish he would try a little harder next time."
2,Queenan dropped the ball.,"This book could have been a funny, nasty little read. Instead, it only offered three or four good laughs and half a dozen insights. Even though the chapter is one of the funniest, everyone alright knows that Cannonball Run II is BAD. Ditto for Branson, MO and John Tesh. It's when Queenan is tearing down sacred cows that he is at his best. Particularly nasty were the (well-deserved) attacks on Billy Joel and the author of The Bridges of Madison County. Too often, however, the author just lists things that he thought ""sucked"" rather than explaining why they sucked. He also makes sure we know that he had good taste before his misadventures in writing this book. Elvis Costello recieved more mentions in this book than in his autobiography. Queenan is a much funnier man being interviewed than on paper. The book's only redeeming quality? Queenan found Evil Dead II to be ""watchable."""
5,celebrate liberty! famous patrotic speeches and sermons,More people need to know the Christian roots of this country and not the falsehoods that thwy are being taught.
1,????????????,"It seems like John Larkin (a.k.a. Scatman John)is a happy family man and possibly just recently turned into a daddy. How else could you explain such babyish lyrics to his songs? This supposedly newborn child of his must be his lyric writer. No sane grown man could POSSIBLY compose a single song like ""Scatman's World"", for instance. I admit it! I had to sit and listen to it to see just how unbelievably bad it was, and by the time the song finished, I had the impression I had walked out from hearing a grown man's impressions of one child at a nursery! It's absolutely repulsive, what some people have to do to get money."
5,duro-med quad cane small base,"I've bought two of these recently--one for myself, one for a neighbor who liked mine. It's sturdy and stable; can be adjusted for right-or-left-hand use. (the loop should face forward for best balance--I've seen some people not use them correctly). Mine has a plastic film giving it some color--it's light-colored. It replaces a black one lost in travel. Light color is easier to find at night in dim light. The film CAN get nicked. I plan to touch up nicks with nail polish; craft stores have paints that also would probably work for touch-up. The foam handle is firm--softer than a rubber handle, but will probably wear. However--this was less than a third of the price for one available at a local store--so when the foam wears out, I'll just get a new cane! My neighbor is totally pleased with her silver cane also."
5,Cute stories for these Biblical feasts,"Our kids have loved this for years. We originally had the two on VHS videos, that got worn out over the years. I was thrilled to see it available on DVD and 2 together. These are fun stories that help explain the meaning of the holidays. Now our younger children can enjoy the same stories of these Biblical Feasts that their older siblings did."
5,Hellooooooo Nurse,"Good quality for the price. I shopped around for a bit and found this product was the best price since it included the stockings, outfit, hat and stethoscope. The outfit does not cover up the butt much so heads up on that, you might want to keep this one for around the house;-)"
4,Cute for costume or pinup!,"Really do love this item, only had a few complaints! The first being, the belt was sooooo long. I had to cut off the end and make a new hole for the buckle, which was easy enough. I also went ahead and cut the garters that came attached, off, and wear it with my own separate red garter underneath. Item looks like it'll be easily washed, and it would be adorable for a pinup shoot!"
4,Second Contact,"Being the sequel to one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read, (First Evidence) I expected a lot. I didn't get quite what I expected but it was an engaging read. For the most part, this book fills in the gaps from ""First Evidence."" It explains a lot and makes you go, ""Oh yeah."" You must, however, read the first book or you will be lost. ""Outer Perimeter"" started slow but built it's intrigue bit by bit. Several times, I thought of putting it down but it finally grabbed me. Most books fizzle by the last third. This one takes off like a UFO! The ending didn't grab me but it makes me think he may be thinking of writing another one. (Sidenote: It's interesting that three recent novels all have ""black panthers/jaguars"" as a nemesis. <Temple by Matt Reilly, Amazonia by James Rollins, and this book> Have I missed a wildlife trend?)"
1,Tuner work ok but capo does not,"I was very disappointed with this tuner/capo. The tuner worked fine, although not as sensitive as my older intellitouch PT-2 tuner i've had for years. The biggest problem for me is that the capo function of this thing does not have enough clamping force to camp down on the strings firm enough! this is especially true for low E string. i'm going to return this thing and get a separate tuner and Kyser capo instead.there were so many high reviews, there is a chance i got a defective unit but it appears to be more of a design problem where the spring used is too weak."
1,Tuner doesn't pick up vibrations!,"The tuner sensors did not pick up vibrations very well. I would have to pluck a note several times before getting a reading and after I adjusted the tuning knobs I would have to wait again. Not at all ideal for quick tuning at live performances. Returned it and bought a standard Intellitouch tuner and used my old standard capo. Worked 100 TIMES BETTER. I would recommend a cheaper tuner and a simple capo over this attempt at a bundled item. Also, the angle of the screen is very hard to read, seeing as it has to be perpendicular with the neck while acting as a capo."
1,Wow - pretty bad,"I never write reviews, but I felt that I had to for this waste of money. In addition to being VERY sluggish in recognizing plucked notes, it often didn't pick up the sounds AT ALL! On more than one capoed location (3 & 6), it wouldn't even read the low E string. No response. When it does respond, it's slow...and then slow to adjust to the tuning. So, you end up over-tuning. Pretty useless."
5,Capo/Tuner from Intellitouch,A friend showed up at the jam with one and I was sold...doesn't even seem to have a problem with low E. Now I'm waiting for the banjo version 'cause the guitar model is too big and too strong for a banjar.
3,Some jars leak,"Overall, these jars were exactly what I was looking for. I used them for homemade sugar scrub and the size and wide mouth are perfect for this use. However, some of the jars would leak even after I screwed the top on tightly. This was disappointing."
3,Seemed Mechanical,"Although there's a lot of funny dialogue between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin at the beginning of this book, the story as a whole seemed rote, as if the author were going through familiar motions without heart. In this story millionaire Otis Jarrell hires Wolfe to discover whether his (Jarrell's) daughter-in-law is stealing business secrets and selling them elsewhere. In order to uncover the truth, Wolfe has Archie take a job as Jarrell's secretary and move into the Jarrell penthouse. Archie does, and then murder follows. More than one. The mystery is solved at the end when Wolfe interviews the suspects and presents a piece of evidence given him by Inspector Cramer. Worth reading if you're a Nero and Archie fan. Maybe even if you're not and just want the taste of a 1950s mystery with lots of wit and cleverness."
1,A very poor effort by a novice movie maker....,"It's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe-horned into such a bad movie. I don't see how it could have yielded six 5-star reviews (The Godfather it ain't).Using its better scenes, you could put together a trailer for this movie that would make you want to see it. And you may be entertained through much of the movie. But when the story becomes quite nonsensical in the final minutes of the movie, you will feal cheated and wish that you had watched something else. At least that's how everyone in my family felt when we watched it."
3,Good and bad..,"I have to say, I can agree with just about every review in here. There was good, there was bad. The plot was a cool concept, and I would've given it another star if it didn't get almost unbearably slow at times.I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan going back to 2 Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place, and just about everything he's been in, I liked the job he did. I was let down in this one though, until nearly the end. Then he had his chance to shine.Always a pleasure watching James Earl Jones, who did a great job of hovering on the line of does he / doesn't he. While we knew the answer from an audience perspective, it wasn't because his character gave anything away.I actually liked the ending, to me it didn't feel as if it just negated the entire movie. In a way, it really hammered home the experience and the morality of the choices everyone made.So had it been less protracted in some spots, a 4, but a solid 3 or 3.5 anyway, not a waste of time, and good conversation fuel."
1,This is Boorringg,"This is horrible! Who the heck wrote that this game is so darn good if you can't go to sleep this will put you to sleep! First of all, this ain't an action/adventure game. All you do is just walk around and talk to people. Where the hecks the action?"
1,Huge disappointment,I bought this item because of its muli use functions; however it broke apart shortly after purchase. It needs to be redesigned to obtain more stability
4,The best of both worlds.,The Weaver mounts allow the use of the scope and the iron sights. Doesn't get much better than that.Definitely would recommend this product.
3,Screws wrong size on base for older 10/22. No response from Weaver.,"I am going to keep these,but will have to drill and retap the gun to get these to fit. 10/22 is from mid-80s so I am assuming Ruger changed the mount screw size, would have been nice to know before I ordered these. Overall it is a great design. No response from an email to Weaver on this issue in over three weeks, so that says a bit about their customer service to me."
3,Kinda good,"you have to remove your picanny rail from the top of the 10/22 and this bolts on in the same holes, it says it fits 1"" scope, which I have, but it has gaps on the four top moutning brackets. Good price for what it is, but, I dont really care for it at all for looks..."
5,Great Sights For The 10/22,"These are great for mounting a scope on your Ruger 10/22. They keep the scope tight, and also provide a rather good sight picture for your iron sights if you want to use them. I've had other ""over/under"" scope rings that don't work nearly as well as these do. The iron sights are still fully functional if you choose to use them."
5,The perfect toaster Oven set,"This set is perfect, I cook for one most of the time. This set makes muffins, just perfect for breakfast, and roast just comes out nice and brown, cookies come out so nice. The best part is the clean up, everything comes out easy, no sticking. Washing is easy, by hand or dishwasher. I love these pans. Perfect for my toaster oven. Cooking for one is the best."
1,Tiny and cheap,"I was looking for a replacement set for our Krups tabletop convection oven, and this was NOT it. Way too small."
5,Steve Martin is a genius!,His writings have always been the best to me. I love this little book and am sure you will too.
4,Wild and Crazy!,"It took me forever to find a copy of this album (on record, of course) and I was not dissapointed when I listened! Steve Martin kills us again with his wit. A great buy, in my opinion (If you really care)."
4,WHEN DO WE GET TO MEET TUCKER?,"I know she could write faster if she'd really really try! This one wasn't my favorte (I love ""Sweet Nothings"") but I couldn't put it down and then had to re-read it! I do tend to agree that it's getting a little heavy with the physical and emotional problems the main characters have but you do have to admire the author for making romance for everyone.I can't wait for Tucker to ""fall"", and did anyone catch that Mary Coulter has someone in mind and she has five brothers.... BE STILL MY HEART WE'RE MOVING ONTO ANOTHER FAMILY!"
3,"Good, but it's getting a little creepy....","I liked this book, I truly did. I have been reading all of the Coulter series and I'll admit, I'm hooked; I will end up reading everything from Anderson that I find. That being said, I could *not* read this book with out recalling the others I have read by this author. A blind woman. An abused woman. A paraplegic. Now someone who can't use language? It really took something away from the book I felt, because all I can see in the heroine is another victim. It's becoming a theme, which makes the story seem more cookie-cutter than beautiful."
5,Perfect for the Dorm,I sent this to my son at college. He thought it was very good. It is a nutritious and easy meal. The cost is good and it arrives at their door. Let Amazon do the shopping and transporting.
1,"Actually made in 1898? Try 2005, (and not 1953).","Imagine a jerky silent movie made the same date as the book, colorized (sometimes) in various colors, and dubbed. Add a repetitive score as simple and irritating as the soundtrack from a triple-X movie. Throw in the worst computer generated graphics in memory.Its only redeeming quality is causing the viewer to wonder how long ago it was made. To which the answer is ""not 1953"".This stinker of a movie seems to have been made solely to trick customers who want to see the ""original"" before the new remake. This isn't it.Instead, go see anything else, whether or not science fiction. Heck, see Spanglish. It has good acting, an interesting story and characters, heart, and wonderful dialogue."
4,Surprisingly fun and worth it.,"I was very suprised at this film. It was fun, exciting, just scary enough to chill me in parts, and very original. The plot itself was extremely unoriginal, we've all seen numerous alien invasion stories, but this one seems to be the original martians land to take over the earth. I read the H. G. Wells biography on the DVD and the guy also wrote the Time Machine and the Invisible Man.Grudgingly, I have to admit that as a small movie studio these guys did pretty well, I'm no Indie fan, trust me, and the brother was my favorite character, he takes a beating and keeps going. I also happened to have a least favorite character, and I cheered when a particular blonde haired cry baby got eaten.This wasn't the best movie but it was definetly worth watching and I plan on seeing it again some time. I've decided to try reading the book although I'll probably watch the movie at the same time to follow along.In the end, a sturdy, worthy film."
2,The War of the Worlds,Was ok. I did not really like it. It was not what I expected. People will have to see it for themselves.
4,Good adapation from best selling book.,"Thought this was an excellent movie. Lots of action, adventure, and humor."
1,"""Wott nooos too-dey?""","Never have so few mangled so many words of the English language as the cast of this home movie. None of them can do an English accent but figure that if they mispronounce a word completely in the most surreal way then that'll do. It's hysterically funny for the first few minutes, but then you realise the film is so slow and so bad that you feel your will to live being sapped. It's the most crazily incompetent film ever made, bad on every single technical level and a lousy bit of storytelling to boot. When it takes 50 minutes for the Martian cyclinder to open, you know these poor deluded fools don't know the first thing about how to make a film. I doubt they even had a script. It plays like they had a copy of the book and passed it round before each take! Pathetic. It's almost worth buying to see just how bad a film can be, but in the end it's just too long and boring to provide much in the way of laughs."
3,I liked this movie.,I liked this movie. It tells Wells' story for real.It keeps the story alive and entertaining.A good evening movie.
5,Warmly nostalgic. Like an antique photograph.,"H.G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is warmly nostalgic. It sticks like a stamp on the envelope of your memory. It's really the story as Wells wrote it. My kids were entirely enchanted by this movie The moral of the story is obvious but pertinent: complacency kills and, when invaded by martians you must remain calm. The earthen sepia-tone hues gave it a magicalness of its own, like an antique photograph. I'm sure with all the chatter about Spielberg's version based on the same material that this movie will get a lot of play. But after that's over, because this movie is so faithful to Wells, it is destined to become a cult classic and live on for years to come. Definitely worth the ten bucks."
4,H.G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is the most faithful Wells,"H.G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is the most faithful Wells adaptation of all time.An amazing successful attempt to translate H. G Wells' novel. Be warned: the special effects in this movie are done like a vintage film, like Frankenstein. So if you're looking for the everyday blockbuster, this isn't it. This film is fresh, like no other. For the epic story, great aliens and fighting machines, performances and overall entertainment value I recommend it and I give it four stars."
4,I liked this movie.,I have now seen both the War Of The Worlds movies. The Steven Spielberg movie is has some impressive special effects. This movie has the story of the original book. I prefered this version.
2,Poorly done,"Being familiar with the Wells story, and assuming that everyone else is too, I didn't expect them to use the same old tired solution about a virus in this movie. After all, they completely changed the Wells story around in so many ways. The least they could do is come up with an original solution. Even Independence Day resorted to the old virus trick.The movie is boring. I couldn't watch it straight through without doing something else. While the movie was running on DVD I turned to Amazon and did a review of The Godfather, which is of course a far superior film to this silliness.Guess what happens right after our hero sees a fallen alien. Yeah, his kid runs up, his long lost kid, with his wife not far behind. What a coincidence. And that pastor, what an annoyance he was. Save me, Jesus.This is simply a poorly done movie. Don't waste your time or money on it."
3,good,"The story line is right from the book, and the acting is fairly good, my only problem was with the photography, the image was jerky at times when the actors were on screen.I had no problems with the special effects, given that it is understood that Pendragon Productions is not a major studio like Paramount.Other then the jerky movments of the scenes, it was a farily good movie."
4,Exciting Movie,I like this movie better than the 1953 movie because it doesn't just change the story around to fit hollywood. I remember reading the book as a boy and it's great even now. This movie tells the book. It doesn't have sophisticated special effects so remember it's an independent movie and a quite amazing entertaining movie.
1,My eyes! MY EYES!!!,"I can no longer see because of this movie! Run away! Flee for your life!The worst....and I mean THE WORST film I have EVER SEEN. EVER! To call this ""War of the Worlds"" is a slap in the face to the great H.G. Wells. If there were some way to show this ""film"" to him, I'm sure Mr. Wells would have changed his name and MOVED TO MARS to get as far away as possible from this god-awful movie.Thank goodness I saw this for free! If I had to pay for this DVD, I would have driven to Mr. Hines' house and beat the money out of him.STAY AWAY!"
1,Huge Disappointment,"As a fan of the book, I was happy to hear of the plans for this film. As a fan of science fiction films, I was anticipating a movie which could rank very high among my favorites. Instead, this is one of the most poorly done films I have ever seen: editing, acting, lighting, continuity, script, etc. This is no way to bring a classic sci-fi novel to the screen! The poor quality of the production interferes with any appreciation of the plot. I am still waiting for an authentic film of WOTW which is both faithful to the book and professionally made. If you are wondering if you should spend your money on this version of WOTW, my advice is to go to the Book section of Amazon and buy the paperback instead!"
1,There are better items than this to buy from Amazon.com,"Think of the worst movie you've ever seen...this one is worst. The good reviews I'm seeing on this site must be there to sucker you into wasting your money...I know I did. I've definitely learned my lesson. Ignore the great packaging and visit www.imdb.com first before dropping cash on this scam. If I see the name Timothy Hines associated with any movie in the future, I will steer clear. Lousy effects, acting, editing, and music. There's nothing good to be said about this movie. Avoid this movie!"
4,A Must See,"This sci-fi/horror/costume drama set at the turn of the century in Victorian England, as Wells intended it to be, has both an epic scale and focused, personal stories.We also get a really funny Curate whose natural humor gives the comic relief needed to balance out the tragedies or war.A must see and, certainly, the most memorable version of the classic sci-fi novel ever to come along."
3,A Pretty Good Movie,"This movie is considerably better than I had been led to expect. It does possess many of the commonly noted weaknesses, the most serious being clumsy editing, followed by variably indifferent acting, and there certainly are aspects of over-fidelity, in dialogue and narration, to the source novel. That being said, the story is interesting (I've watched it twice, and it did not bore me) and faithful, on the whole, to Wells (although the ending should have been further developed); the special effects are serviceable, and occasionally excellent (I could readily suspend disbelief, although the ""Thunder Child"" sequence did tax me); and the characters of the Writer, the Curate, and Ogilvy were sufficiently engaging, especially the latter, to hold my attention. I don't know that this one will replace George Pal's version in my affection, but I much prefer this to any of its recent competitors."
3,I think you'd like it,"I saw this movie last night and can only say it is very awesomely exciting and engaging and then at times it's not. It has that old-time feeling of Victorian England, mish-mashed with one mother of a Martian. The music was very good and moved me tears once. The slow bits were distracting which is why I don't give it the best score, but the war scenes and scope of the movie were so epic and exciting and wouldn't want you to miss this one.end of my review"
1,don't waste your time or money!,"This movie will give ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" a run for worst movie ever made. There is truly nothing redeeming about this. Please, take my word for it. I know how it feels to want something new from this great story, but this is NOT it.I would give you specifics but the fact is I would have to recount the entire movie. The acting is terrible, the cinematography would not pass a college course, and the interpretation of the original material is by far the worst.It took WEEKS for me to get through the whole film. I literally had to stop over and over because I just couldn't take it! When I eventually did finish I put the CD away and swore I would never inflict such pain on myself again. If I could give this no stars, I would."
2,cheap,"This is very poorly done in terms of the graphics but very accurate to the book. the main problem is that every thing is CG and CG sucks in this film.It is worse than before computer anamation times like in the 50s. not evan fire can be real, or crowds, or horse and carts, or a boat at sea, and most of the shots that are not cartoon are people obvousily making pretend scared faces when the clanc-clanc of the tripods is heard. They could have at least thrown rubber-made skeletons down on the grownd so it would look like it is in the picture with every thing.overall it was accurate to the book(and that is what counts, right?)."
2,B MOVIE MASTERPIECE,"ALL I WILL SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS; IF IT WAS MADE IN THE FIFTIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASTERPIECE. THE PROBLEM, IT'S 2005--I WILL ADD TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW---ANOTHER REVIEW SAID I WAS WRONG THAT THE 1953 VERSION STILL STANDS UP---I AGREE 100%--SO I WILL SAY IF THIS MOVIE WAS MADE IN THE THIRTIES NOT THE FIFTIES IT WOULD BE A MASTERPIECE..."
4,Bizarrely entertaining.,"-Bizarrely entertaining, Pendragon Pictures' ""H.G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds"" is a full-flavored movie with a lot of guts and bite."
3,descent,I particularly like the head titles and music and long opening sequence up to the martians coming out.
3,hg wells the war of the worlds,"Long movie, wait for a rainy day to watch. I didn't like the movies newsreel effect. The special effects were low budget. The movie does follow the book fairly close. I would have liked to see this movie done with a bigger budget."
3,Good for the dough.,With little dough these guys made one helluva movie. I liked it enough to watch it again with my girlfriend. I didn't like the walking so much cuz videos are my thing and dang if that guy didn't walk across half of England. The battles were dope. The fight was the best.
4,Totally worth watching and owning.,"This beautifully crafted sci-fi movie is the most enthralling version of Wells classic tale I have seen.It rises and falls on the strength of its individual sections, all of which are interesting, exciting and a bit eccentric.Totally worth watching and owning."
1,The biggist pile of crud i have ever seen!!!!,"Right , ive just watched pendragon pictures war of the worlds and .........well.............erm............oh dear !!!!!This has got to be the biggest pile of steaming bull poo i have ever waisted 3 hours of my life watching, its so bad you start to laugh as things get progressevly worse. If i could give it no stars i would have.The CGI is really bad, its like something thats been knocked up on a zx-spectrum , the acting......oh dear, i work offshore and i expect to see these guys working on oilrigs within the next few months cos no one will ever employ them as actors again.If you want this movie then do yourself a favour and wait a few months and pick it up on ebay for $0.10, and even then youll be getting ripped off.Tim Hines is a twonk, and hes just crucified a great book and a great story with his playing at being a movie man, do everyone a favour tim and go flush your head down a toilet you bloody trumpet!!!DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL CRUD!!!"
2,"Wow, that was exhausting...","I'm hard-pressed to find a reason to recommend this film. The acting, special efforts, and set design leave a great deal to be desired. And, it seemed like this movie went on forever. To me, the only slightly redeeming feature of this film is that it is a mostly faithful adaptation of the original novel. The only reason I'd ever recommend this film is if you're too lazy to read the book for a school assignment."
5,Well put adventure.,"I don't care what you say this is a well put together film.The movie was funny, sad, and an enjoyable adventure to save Earth from aliens in Victorian times."
4,A powerful work.,"Whatever flaws it has, this tale is a bizarrely amusing delight. Rich with fantasies of war and aliens, it opens the festering wounds of war and gazes inside without blinking, while speaking to us in poetry."
1,How much you like it really depends on how stupid you are,"This really is a film for idiots. Tim Hines thinks his audience have no intelligence every step of the way. He constantly has his terrible leading man narrate what is happening as if we are too stupid to guess for ourselves. Every minor point is repeated again and again in case we missed it.All plot points from the original book are touched without any emotional depth or nuance by a supremely untalented filmmaker. Performances are clumsy and hammy at best and Hines has no idea how people interact. The silent dinner sequence is a classic example of pointless padding, bad acting and hopeless directing. It adds nothing and makes his pitiful players look even worse than they already did. Impressive achievement.For all the Pendragon shills on this site giving themselves a round of applause - how many more Bravos or Congratulations Mr Hines can they fake? - this film deserves only the loudest of boos. My cat has dragged in better."
1,"If you believe the great reviews here, you deserve this film","I won't go into why this is the worst movie of the past fifty years. Other reviewers have done it better. I'd just say check out all the reviews here before buying. If you honestly think that all the raves came from ordinary members of the public who loved the same film and expressed it in the same way, then maybe you're forgiving enough to like this film. I doubt it. You'll probably feel conned. But you might. If you look at the movie, it's clearly made by idiots for idiots. Buyer beware!"
1,A work of art with a capital `F'!,"Pictures like paintings? Great characterization? Great script? Get outta here - this is amateur night at the Dixie Bar and Grill, and if you can stay awake through this junk for three hours of this dumb show then you're a better man than I am, Gunga Din! And is it just me, or do the Martians look like the Tweenies?Crap has a new name - Timothy Hines' War of the Worlds. Buy it and weep!"
4,Had a great time watching this movie.,This is the first Victorian War of the Worlds and an outstanding one at that. I had a great time watching this movie. It followed the original book and unfolds chapter by chapter. The actors and scenery was beautiful and I loved the explosive army raids and discovery of the martians. The main man's experience is very fun to follow and his co-stars are both touching and funny. Loved the red-turned martian world and their fighting gizmos.
3,Good telling of the book.,"I like this War of the Worlds. It was a good telling of the story written some hundreds years ago. It's well-put together and is entertaining most of the time, but some of the affects are strange and just bad. If you like the SciFi Channel you'll like this."
1,Better than a poke with a stick... On second thought.....,"It's the best work the amateur volunteers workshop has ever done with over 2 weeks experience! With over twelve dollars budget for special effects, and nearly double that for costumes. Acting so good you will swear their features are carved in wood. It's better than ""Ishtar"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""! (Well, maybe not quite that good). It's perfect for collectors who like this stuff! Don't fail to miss it if you can! Antidotes are being concocted as you read this! Totally faithful to the book, but the author is still spinning in his grave. The story beats the Speelburg movie by miles, but it just flops otherwise."
5,8 bit humor,"If you like vido games and crude humor this is the best show ever , if not look elsewhere . This show had so much potential unfortunatly it did not last"
5,"Ultimate, clear, contains simple english words.","This book is really good. Text is clear. Nuts and bolts book about how to meditate. I feel good every time I think about this book. Writer is not only good meditation teacher, he is also good writer. If you don't know what to do with your mind, this book is for you."
5,This is one book I keep coming back to.,"I started reading this book in electronic (PDF) form, and liked it a lot, so I got a paper copy. I felt that it spoke directly to me, pointed out the turbulent states of mind in which I kept finding myself, and suggested a way out. So I started my own attempts at practicing what it suggests. I can definitely say it has made a huge difference in my life. I have been practicing for a little over a year now, and I keep going back to reading the book. Each time I do, the ideas seem just a little bit clearer and the mind a bit lighter.I hope you have the same experience of peace and happiness."
5,A Must Read for Everyone!!!,"Truly a must read for everyone - both Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike.Bhante G is absolutely amazing and speaks to the heart. If you want to learn the truth about peace and life, read his works. Priceless."
5,Simple. Insightful. Encouraging.,"Excellent book. Love the style and the tone of the book. A must-read for everyone given the stressful times that we live in.As someone who has been battling depression for a long time, this book stabilized my moods like nothing else has. I'm so much more clear-headed and productive thanks to the techniques in the book."
5,Easy to Understand,"This is one of those books that is quite simple on the first read, but reveals a much deeper level of insight as you begin to apply the principles. Mindfulness as a concept is difficult for westerners who have been taught to rationalize everything, but it is an essential skill for seeing things as they truly are. Gunaratana gives the reader a step-by-step system for learning the basics, and introduces Buddhist concepts gently, in a non confrontational way. He is not saying that Vipissana meditation is the only way to experience the world, but that it is one way.This book has changed the way I look at the world, and given me tools to understand what I am experiencing. An incredible value and an incredible book."
3,Eh...,"I thought since this was the ""plain english"" version of mindfulness, it wouldn't be so blah, but it was. Perhaps mindfulness and meditation aren't for me, as I had no intention of becoming a Buddhist. I thought I could just be a more mindful person or live with more intention or something... I guess I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it. I got halfway through the book and then gave it away to a friend who is a bit more of a ""free spirit"" than I am, in hopes she could glean something useful from its pages."
2,Some of his statements really lack humility.,"Overall this book is okay, but the author makes very bold statements such as describing certain monks as being ""100% mindful"" and ""having no faults"" and ""since he had no pride."" Statements like this are scattered throughout the book implying that it is possible to become perfect and flawless through meditation and Buddhist practices. Somewhere along the way, this author missed some very important lessons about Buddhism, or belongs to a dogmatic tradition, as far as I can see. I'd opt for the insight meditation kit offered here on Amazon or look for another book, to be honest. This author does not impress me."
2,Not a Good Book...,"My biggest pet peeve in a book is repetition to make a book into a book rather than a pamphlet. Too much repetition and not engaging enough in it's repetition to be considered worthwhile. If you are a true beginner and want to just start meditating, I'd recommend ""8 Minute Mediation"". It'll get you going and you can learn more later."
5,A great success,"This is one of our favorite shows and this dvd definitely packs in a few of the greats that you can watch again and again. A few friends have borrowed it and now are addicted to the show like us. Phenomonal!! Now I don't have to worry about tuning in when it is on court tv, I can watch it at my leisure!!"
4,Revisiting my youth,"First read the Swift series in my teen years, which was not yesterday. Reread this as I had forgotten what they were like. It is a good read for the target market of YA's and a pleasant and brief distraction for an adult."
3,Used in a Graduate Class,The book covers a lot of material. Can be difficult to read and get through at times. Some of the steps in the derivations are omitted.The examples are very well done and quite helpful though. The exercises at the end of the chapters are useful and highlight what was learned in each chapter well.
4,The Transition Season,In this season we see Ann Marie transition from her girliness to womanhood (although just as feminine and stylish as the previous 3 seasons)as we are being prepared for what is to come in season 5. Marlo and Ted are just as wonderful here as before and just as loveable. I am anxiously awaiting season 5 to arrive at my door..The whole collection brings back many fond memories of a wonderful show and era. Thank you Marlo.
3,A Laugh or Two....,"Some laugh out louds. some dull streches. It's good enough to kill a weekend couple of hours. It takes a while to get used to the style of comedy, would be funnier to anyone whose name which ends in sson, ssee, dotter."
1,ARG!!!,A spoof of a spoof of a spoof of all the scifi of the last 50 years. A bad script and poor acting is embellished by passable special effects. What a waste..
4,"Spoofish, ""B Movie"" with subtitles and great budget action.",This film is a great vehicle for the producer toward Iron Sky which is a fantastic independent film released 2012. Enjoyed the movie and saw the premier of Iron Sky which I have on pre-order.
3,INTERESTING,"VERY INTERESTING BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO READ. THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN THE LATE 1800'S. THE MATERIAL IS VERY GOOD AND INTERESTING BUT THE GRAMMATICAL STYLE, I FIND AGONIZING. I REALLY HAVE TO READ SLOWLY AND REREAD SEVERAL TIMES TO GET THE POINT OF A PARAGRAPH. THE GRAMMAR IS SO BAD IT READS LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS UNEDUCATED TRIES TO SOUND ALOOF AND SCHOLARLY. IF THE GRAMMAR WAS IMPROVED THE BOOK WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIALLY SHORTER AND MUCH MORE UNDERSTANDABLE. THE MATERIAL IS 5 STAR, THE GRAMMATICAL STYLE IS BELOW 1 STAR.HENCE THE SCORE OF 3 IS BUT THE BEST, BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE POORNESS OF THE GRAMMAR, IS THAT IS OVERCOME BY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MATERIAL, THAT I FEEL I CAN MAXIMALLY POSSIBLY ASSIGN TO THIS MATERIALLY INTERESTING WORK. - AS PIAZZI SMYTH MAY HAVE STATED!!!"
2,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I look at all the five star reviews of this book and just shake my head. Much of this slim, overpriced volume consists of ""methods"" that have the same reliability as a coin flip. One of the chapters is nothing more than a description of a very simple candlestick indicator. The author calls it a ""lizard"" but in candlestick charting it's known as either a shooting star or a hammer. Some of the techniques described demonstrate a worthwhile approach to combining indicators. But, that said, one of the hallmarks of the publisher of this book is high-priced volumes that are not proofread for awkward writing and poor syntax. That problem combined with some of the flimsy methodology in this book add up to questionable value for the money. At 100 bucks a pop the beginning or intermediate trader would do much better picking up either or both of Steve Nison's books on candlestick charting."
1,Biggest RIPOFF I ever fell for,"Don't listen to these BS reviews, I tested his methods on historical data, and they simply lose money. This book is one of the biggest ripoffs I ever fell for in my whole life. I would give negative stars if I could.I hope Amazon publishes this to protect their customers"
3,Buyer Beware,"Do any of these strategies work? Not in my experience. Sure you get an occasional day here or there where they perform well, but for the most part if you back test you won't find anything here. It may be possible to filter these trades, but so far no one has stepped forward to tell you how. Certainly not Jeff Cooper in this book. For the person who has lost only a point per trade with the success ratio that I've found that would bankrupt you fairly quickly. The book may have some value as a stimulus to thinking. These patterns may have worked once. As with anything good you need to find your own patterns and do your own work. The book is not worth it's price. It should be discounted. Even Schwab has lower comissions now than the price of this book."
5,Excellent,"Top quality......excellent intake, very happy with the looks and performance, I will purchase for all future vehicles. Install is a piece of cake as well."
2,More Euro Trash,"If you're a fan of the cheap Euro horror films of the 70s, then this is a five star. If not, probably a one star and switch off halfway through. Typical story about a doctor who turns up at a castle only to find that it is being haunted by an invisible monster. Plenty of dubbing and implied sex scenes. It's a sort of ""Invisible Frankenstein"". It'll make a nice companion piece to ""Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks"" and the Jess Franco movies.This has also been released as ""The Invisible Dead"" in the UK."
3,orloff and the slightly transparent ape,"here's a real euro stinker for you. a doctor is summoned to orloffs castle during a storm. there he meets orloffs invisible man which despite being called an invisible man is a)only invisible part of the time b)appears to be somebody in an ape suit rather than a man. not much in particular happens throughout the entire film but it still manages to be so bad it's good. for a few years i actually thought this was a jess franco film-it's uncanny! buy it,grab a few friends and some beer and have a great time!"
3,"Nice, but creased","We have a beautiful unfinished dinner table we just purchased. Since we were having lots of guests over with red wine, etc., I decided that I would cover the wood in a clear cover because the table is truly beautiful and I didn't want to hide the wood. I just want to protect it until we finish and seal it. It did what it is supposed to do so that's good.It never lost the fold marks, however, and I had to leave it out in the garage for a long time to get the toxic fumes out of it. The creases are why I downgraded it. They're still in it and I have it hanging in a closet. I was ready for the plastic toxins releasing, just not the seemingly eternal creases."
2,Ho-Hum,"Just another of many,many books written about life in Germany during the rise of the Nazi movement.Many others tell a wider more gripping story."
2,I love the Midsomer Murders series...,"....but I hate what they do to the DVDs. When I buy a DVD, I expect to get the entire show/episode but I am now watching DEATH OF A STRANGER on TV and there are scenes showing that are not on the DVD!!!! That totally ticks me off."
1,Tax Fraud,Jay-z paid for the wickedest talents. paid this talent by sampling the recording and didnt give tax to the talent of buying the sample of 24-Carat Black(theme) so if he wants to soe what he is into he should give these talented people what they into. better money cuz he didnt even give them any authority to rule what was once a hit to his agnologing of there super art and made super pay.
3,Should be labeled for a girl,"We received this as a gift for my son. It is described as blue, but the description fails to mention that the bugs are pink as the chin strap is as well. We were really disappointed and are returning it to purchase another that is either gender neutral or for a boy. I am sure that the helmet would have worked fine, but the description for this item is not thorough enough."
4,Another Arthur Miller Success,"Arthur Miller never ceases to impress me. As one of the greatest American playwrights in history, Miller depicts the lives of these characters in a beautiful yet relatable way. Definitely a good read if you have a free afternoon to yourself. I would suggest reading the whole thing in one sitting. Definitely helps the pacing of the story."
4,Faithful,"Still one of the best wired mice around, Microsoft does not disappoint in its trusted reliability for older computer users."
3,ownage,the scroll wheel is loose and creaky but fully functional. the best 400dpi mouse u can get anywhere. if it lasts 5 months i will have gotten my $$$ worth because my game has gotten 500% better since i switched to a 3.0
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"When I first saw the ""Second Opinion"" Sopranos episode and heard the outstanding song ""Black Books"" when Carmela went to visit Meadow at college, I immediately searched for it with ""who and where did this great song come from""? Eventually found on the Sopranos ""Steak & Eggs"" soundtrack CD and then went directly to the source found on this excellent CD. All tracks on this CD are well crafted, heartfelt and delivered like ""Black Books"". A very pleasant surprise here and more of an eye opener that I already knew that Nils Lofgren is more than just an important member of the E-Street Band with Bruce that in fact he can star solo as well!!!"
5,The Best CD of the Year!,This is a must for any music fan. Once again Nils' proves himself to one of the greatest guitar players ever. If you don't beleive it then go see this man perform live.
5,This Grandma loves it!,"I had purchased Crooked Line and found it, with a couple of exceptions, far too edgy and hard for my taste. I took another flyer with this album and just love it. It's an album to listen to again & again although ""Keith don't go"" could. I first heard Nils & Tom on a PBS Folk concert from Ark. and they had such a distinctive sound. Keep hoping they'll release an acoustic duo album"
4,Nils Lofgren Live,This CD has some great pieces of acoustic music. This guy is grossly under-rated but the music speaks volumes for his talent both instrumentally and vocally. Fantastic stuff. Not all the tracks are musically challenging but than again others border on classical.
4,Elite house DJ,"All I have to say is this guy got me to open up to House. I am a trance fanatic and ""spirt in my life"" opened me up to want more from this guy! Now im hooked on Cedric Gervais!! This guy brings it!! I love this CD. And his other CDs. There are few lame tracks but Most bring the beat! All i need is to see him live! Can't wait!!"
2,Cedric Gervais,"Has one of my fav tracks on it ""Spirit in my life"". but as a whole cd my mind kept wandering. The first 2 tracks are killers. shame about the rest."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"AFTER BEING A MIAMI LOCAL AND SEENG HIM MIX LIVE, I AM SOOOOOO DISAPOINTED ABOUT THIS CD. ONLY THE FIRST 2 SONGS ARE GOOD, THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS TRULY A BORE. I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS DJ. I'D RECOMMEND YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON OTHER ALBUMS. GET THIS ONE AND YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
2,GOOD AND BAD,"SPIRIT IN MY LIFE FAR AWAY THE BEST TRACK, SKY AND ELECTRO TERAPY ARE GOOD HOUSE TRACKSTHE REST IS REALLY BAD..."
4,Decent Book,This is a decent book on gin rummy. It provides a good synopsis of the different type of player that exists in gin rummy. It is also a quick read.
3,"good illustration, but lack of scientific insights","This book provides many good illustrations for various classes of biomolecules. However, it does not give any scientific insights. The book is descriptive."
4,victim of the joke,I am a music fan from New York if any one knows where i can find David Porter's a portrait of a clown please contact me via my email thatnk you
3,Fun Featherweight,"Well, this one was a fun, quick read, but kind of dissapointing, really. I mean, I expected a bit more. Instead I got drive a little fight a giant mutant bug, drive some more and fight more mutant critters, drive some more and... you get the picture, but it was still fun."
3,Good Shallow Fun,"Well this book was a quick read. Punctuated with Zelanzy's usual lean prose.THe plot is quite simple and basic, A con is given the chance to save half of a Post Apocalyptic Nuclear Torn USA.Basic setup for a bad dude to redeem himself.Well this book is quite short, and in all honesty not to bad. It was fun, but its quite forgetable.In the end I would definetly recomend reading something more worthwhile, even Zelanzy has done better than this."
3,"Good, enjoyable pulp","After a nuclear war most of North America has become a wasteland known as 'Dammnation Alley'. Hell Tanner, the last surviving Hells Angel and due to die for rape, murder, extortion, etc. is given the choice of delivering a vital vaccine to a plague ridden city or being executed.Zelazny writes a imaginitive and hard edged thriller filled with vivid imagery. I suspect that Hell Tanner was the inspiration for 'Escape From New York' Snake Plisken and its a pity that Jack Smight's film was just a dilute interpretation of the original. I am surprised it hasn't been re-published."
4,good lookin out,"Good lookin out for melodramatic! I thouroughly enjoyed this album! My advice to any supporter of hip hop or music in general, is to pick this CD up!!"
5,"the best military in vietnam ever,you'd think you were there",The book is very realistic. Detailed in every way. l.b. scott is a wonderful writer and he captures the horror and compassion of vietnam.A must read for prior military.The follow up book the Last Run picks up where Charlie Mike leaves off. They are great books for ones own collection
4,Good Safe fun for grandchildren!,"I love the ease in purchasing for my Kindle Fire on Amazon, particularly when I'm babysitting my grandchildren.This was perfect choice for quiet, engaging activity!"
5,More Spongebob,Love to watch Spongebob now it is one of my collection can't get enough of spongebob. Waiting for my next one to come out.
4,The Pox in North America,"Elizabeth A. Fenn's Pox Americana (The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82) is an interesting book that traces the course of this horrendous pox as it veers bloodily throughout the continent of North America. It is very well researched and assembled with great skill. The writing lacks a little narrative punch to carry it over to great pop history but it has all the details in the writing for the history fan to enjoy following this story. The most interesting (and important) aspect of the pox story is the tale beyond the Revolutionary War in the rest of the continent, particulary the southwest, north (in Canada) and the Pacific Northwest (where the pox made first contact in many areas, ahead of Europeans). This part of the story is effectively illuminated by the author. An important book beyond its current terrorism inspired significance."
4,"Good follow-on to ""Guns, Germs, & Steel"" &""Washington's War","More scholarly than ""entertaining"" in tone, this book traces smallpox epidemics and their influence upon the progress of war, settlement, and ""who wins"" in the race for political and social primacy. If you've an interest in colonial history (particularly the war for independence in the southern colonies), you'll find that this book explains just how significantly smallpox affected the war's progress (something only tangentially mentioned in other histories I've read) as well as the role it played in the rise and fall of various Indian tribes. I particularly appreciate the author's restraint in making sweeping or hysterical value judgements about the actions of various individuals or nations -- she documents what is, and is not, known and permits the reader to make those judgements for himself."
5,BRILLIANT!!,I THINK THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ EVEN THOUGH I AM ONLY 17. HIS DESCRIPTIONS AND STORYLINES ARE THE BEST. NOW THAT I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THIS BOOK SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN A LIBRARY I WILL BE READING IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE- NEVER GETTING BORED OF IT.
5,This stuff is great,I used this to conceal my speaker wire for my home theater set up that runs all over the place. I didn't bother painting it because I didn't care enough and plan on redoing everything soon anyway. This product is totally customizable to fit any juncture or corner you may need to run speaker across. I have recommended it to many people.
4,Me listening to this cd :),"The man has gone and done it again if u haven't got this and your a fan of trance, techno, or hardhouse get this. I just got done listening to this and I was all smiles. I have to tell u though folks cd 2 is better than one, but all in all worth the buy."
4,Wish there were more Timo Maas remixes on the album,"I love Timo Mass' remix of Dooms Night and Star 69 that came out on singles. Both those remixes blew me away. I expected to hear more of TM's remixes on this album that would have the same energy as the two I mentioned. Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met. I do like the album. Disc 1 sounds very much like listening to Bedrock/Digweed album (quite repetitive, slow-paced and ""dark""), but disc 2 picks up the tempo with more progressive house/ more danceable tracks. I really think Timo Maas is an amazing DJ, but, I feel ""Connected"" fell short of showing off his full potential. He doesn't stick enough to his signature style like you hear in Dooms Night or Star 69 remixes. DJ Icey's Essential Mix is a prime example of sticking to method/signature sound. Overall, I think it's a good album--TM picked out great tracks and the mix is good and well balanced. Digweed fans will love this."
3,omelet pan,"It works pretty well, but you have to be careful of how hot the burner is. Low heat works better. The eggs do stick a bit, but clean up isn't bad at all."
2,International omlet pan,I have been looking for this item for a few years but couldn't find it in stores. Now I know why! Though it is a great idea the results are not good. After extensive spraying with cooking spray the omelet still stuck to the pan and was hard to remove. It also comes out really rubbery for some reason. I would not recommend this item.
1,Omelette pan,"I ordered this omellet pan but never received it as it was sent to the wrong address. I had emailed Amazon about this mistake and never received a reply. I am very dissappointed, that as a customer, I would not even hear from them."
1,Omelet pan,"We've tried this pan several times with olive oil spray, butter and a generic spray and the pan had a serious sticking problem each time. I would not recommend this item."
2,"2...maybe 3 songs, thats IT!","This cd is good for the very first two tracks, which the first is a KMFDM cover of ""Terrible Lie."" Suprizingly, I like this rendition of the song alot. The second in which is Rosetta Stone's rendition of ""Closer."" Although the original Closer beats this cover 10 fold, this is still done quite well, despite it not being Trent Reznor.Other than the first two tracks, the rest of this cd is just terrible..the only thing that would come close to good other than those 2 is the Razed in Black rendition of ""Sin"" which actually starts out MAJORLY like the originally done Nine Inch Nails version of Sin...then dwindles into a mediocre cover.All in all, get this for the first two tracks, or download them. Other than that, track 3 is an ""iffy"" and the rest of the cd is crappy covers, which are dubbed by me as an insult to all that is Nine Inch Nails."
1,Why was it censored,"The American DVD was censored, the way they censored Wild on E!. Maybe the american moral is different from all others. How would americans censored a theatrical representation of La Celestina? Have they not see La Cestina in a Theater? Buy the Spain DVD PAL version. It is not censored, as it should be. It is a completely different experience."
5,Excellent insight,"This book gave me an excellent insight into one of the important aspects of yacht racing: your own psyche. Why do the same people tend to win over and over again, while others tends to loose time after time? Learn to be honest to yourself, face your faults and learn how to correct them."
4,Best for Laptops,"I have not tried any other webcam so can not draw a comparision. I always go for some high-end stuff may it be mobile or laptop or this webcam. This one is very sleek , excellent quality ( need high speed internet at both ends ) , easy to install & has software driven settings (zoom,pan,tilt etc). It clips just fine on my laptop screen. But still its priced a bit higher.I tried this with Skype, Yahoo & Windows Live messenger. It gave the best video performance with Windows Live ( based on comments from other party ). Microphone is good but if you are using laptop speakers, need to keep the volume down as it is not good at Echo cancellation."
1,Does NOT work with MS Vista,"Eventhough this webcam is sold as being certified to work with MicroSoft Vista, it DOES NOT. I can't give it any kind of rating for audio, video or ease of use because it never installed properly. I tried all the latest and greatest donwload upgrades and updates from MicroSoft and it still DOES NOT WORK!!!! A nice looking piece of JUNK!Save your money and buy a Logitech."
2,THE VIDEO is not working for Skype for my Windows....,I don't know why but this is not working fully with my Skype on my windows computer.I have a mac too but when I try just to use the Camera (Because MacBook already got microphone inside)it shut off the Skype in 5 seconds...So I am not really recommending this product.But the Logistic one! They do greater job!
2,Not compatible with Windows Vista or Skype,"The camera's software would not install on my laptop that runs Windows Vista. I installed it on another computer with XP, but the camera would not work in Skype due to an ""Unknown Error."" Installing the latest NX-6000 drivers available online and latest version of Skype did not help. The microphone works well on Skype calls. The camera works fine in a video application that came with it. I haven't yet tried it in any other IM application. The packaging asserts that it is ""compatible with all leading instant messaging software."" This does not appear to be the case, but maybe I will be able to work it out later. Any ideas?"
3,NX-6000 Webcam - Not Security Cam,High quality images and video for the price paid and the compact design. I was disappointed in the limits to the Microsoft software. No motion detection available was very disappointing.
1,MICROSOFT CAN NOT COME OUT WITH A GOOD PRODUCT,"THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORK WITH THE CAMERA AFTER IT IS INSTALLED.THE THE IMAGE COMES AND GOES WITH INTERFERANCE LINES. EVEN AFTER IF WAS UPGRADED TO THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATES, IT DID NOT WORK. I BOUGHT TWO AND HAD TO RETURN BOTH OF THESE ITEMS."
1,Worst purchase ever,"This is really a piece of crap, I bought it for my dad, since I was going to be travelling, I wanted to be able to see him when we spoke through skype or MNS. The camera never worked. We installed it, on Windows XP and it was always ""loading"". Called Microsoft customer service and they couldn't help me make it worked. They were supposed to send me a new one however it never arrived. The truth is, I didn't even complain about this because it such a bad expierience I did not want to risk it again. We had to get a new camera (Genius) that works perfectly and its extremely easy to use (plug and play)"
1,good camera but messes up the computer,"I bought this camera actually two of them for my girlfriend and me. The service was great but what microsoft does not tell you is not to install the software from the cd. My girlfriend ran the cd and crashed her computer and killed her computer's battery, well i got mine a little late and I had read the reviews about this camera and decided it was a good one. when i finally got mine i ran the cd and it crashed my computer and killed my power adapter. The picture quality is not that great the camera keeps freezing every now and then and sometimes the display(the video) flashes green, blue or red. I would not recommend this to anyone as its not worth the trouble it will cause you."
1,a picture is better than a thousand words????,"I purchased this webcam thinking microsoft would offer a quality product. My first one had a picture but everyone on Skype complained of a loud, intermittent static noise. The person (anthembookseller) sent me a replacement which seemed to be better at first, but produced the same loud static sound followed by intermittent total sound loss. I suspect something is wrong with the wiring in the cord as moving the wire changes sound , noise, and silence. I have multiple usb ports and the results are the same in every port.I'm giving up on this webcam and will buy the cheap one my son bought at Target which works perfectly."
3,Still trying to decide ...,"USB driver is not reliable - it shares this defect with my Logitech 5000. If this camera is plugged in, my Abit wireless card doesn't detect. Otherwise, the Abit works perfectly. Both Microsoft and Logitech need to fix their drivers - they just don't work.Video noise is more evident than with the Logi 5000. The NX-6000 doesn't offer echo cancellation as does Logitech, but it doesn't seem to need it as much. Mounting is not flexible - your LDC panel had better not be more than 1/4"" thick. It has a 2' USB cable. There's a wide-angle lens, best for laptop mounting.My keyboard, mouse, external drive, flash drive, and compact-card reader all work fine on USB - why can't Microsoft or Logitech make a video USB driver that works? Microsoft can develop a complex new operating system - Vista - but they can't make a USB driver that works reliably?"
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made.,"I write this as a warning to unwary. Stay away. Stay far, far away."
1,Not as funny and interesting as the first movie.,It's ot as funny and interesting as the first movie. Will and Martin's acting are still good but there's no script for them to play.
4,Dinosaurs that fly,"Another small film that is only entertaining and silly like a French cow with five legs. I must be scratching the bottom of the barrel or scraping the dust in an empty drawer. Speaking of drawers, you may lose yours if you watch too many of these films. Stunts and stunts again, and in between more stunts and so many nice houses that are blown up just like fancy models made of matchboxes and toothpicks. But it is funny because it never ends and they are cops. They disturb more collateral peace than any real war would do. But it is funny and definitely not too tiring for the mind, the brain, or what you may be using in the place of that in order to think about straight, crutches for example. Enjoy it and think you retired about twenty five years ago.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
5,Bad Boys 2,A great sequel. Even funnier than the 1st one. I'm hoping to see a Bad Boys 3 in the future with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as the main focus.
1,Poor quality...severely scratched,"Poor quality. DVD was severely scratched when received. Disappointed that the entire movie skips, makes it difficult to enjoy watching."
2,An ode to killing,"We lost count of the number of people killed in this supposed comedy. The special effects are pretty good, but the purpose of the movie seems to be to desensitise the audience to violent killings. Also, most of the killings seemed to have little to do with the lengthy story."
3,A nice jam session,"I like this one, but with all the 5 stars given out freely by other reviewers, I feel I need to level things out with 3 stars. Yes, its very good jazz but it is basically a jam session. Great players get together, run through a few standards and each one takes a few chorus.This one is filed under Stan Getz, but that is really a catch to lure more buyers, since Getz probably sells more units. All players should get equal billing on this one. Getz on 'It never enter my mind' is really great."
1,"Little Truth, but much warmth","Although this book is sweet, it is not plausible what happens in the end. The book creates a setting for a young boy who is not able to talk, who is suddenly able to speak after six years of silence. The book portrays a Christmas story. I would not use this in my classroom, only because it is so unreal. Being a special education major has made me see that a book about a child with a disability needs to be straight forward. These children are just like anyone else. This book, however, does not show that and seems unreal."
5,first one,this is greati havcent heard itbut its greatim the first mofo to uh...to uh..yeah rate this cdi must be underground as f00k
5,Rimsky-Korsakov: The Tsar's Bride,Rimsky-Korsakov: The Tsar's Bride is a 1999 Philips Classics Productions under the direction of Valery Gergiev who leads the Kirov Chorus and Orchestra. First of the decision to have an all Russian is very wise. They perfectly understand the nuance of the Russian language and when they sing you feel they can more play with the words and make the lyrics truly come alive. The booklet contains both well-written music notes as well as all the lyrics. The pace of the music is right on the mark and Gergiev seems to truly understand Rimsky-Korsakov's music. I very much enjoyed this fine recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
1,Stop insulting Russian music OR let the Russians conduct!,"Valeriy Gergiyev, the most dull, most uninteresting and most non-Russian conductor in the world, is doing his best to make all foreigners think that russian music should be performed like a mixture of Rossini and Wagner. The ""Tsar's bride"", on of the greatest operas ever written here sounds like a cheap provincial recording. The worst singers are Olga Borodina and Marina Shaguch. Listening to them is like comitting suicide. Choose one of the three Bolshoi versions and enjoi real RUSSIANS, singing a real RUSSIAN opera. From Moscow, the greates opera city in the world,with love, V. M. K."
2,Very confusing at times,"This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life."
4,My favorite book!,"When Helen Keller was a baby, she was perfectly normal. Until got a dangerous illness. Her fever would mysteriously come and go. At first, the doctors thought she was going to die, but no one - not even he doctor knew about her losing her hearing and sight. From this day she doesn't recall what happened during the first months after her illness. She was born in Tuscumbia, a little town in northern Alabama, on June 27, 1880."
4,funky kha-chunky,A must for those former high school brass band geeks! I listen to it daily just to get my freek on!
5,Max Payne is great and doesn't limit you to reality.,"Max Payne is great. Although is face is sort of... graphically challenged, the game is spectacular. This game has a really good rep and its not just one of those games you look at and say ""I've never heard of that game so it must not be that important,"", the game is great and has 10 out of 10 violence and has alot to do with the mafia and the NYPD. It took me 12 and 3/5 hours to beat straight through. MP gives you the chance to zoom into the game and be Max yourself. Now the question remains... what will you do when you walk home from work and find your wife and baby dead with blood spread everywhere? Exactly. Play and you'll see."
4,"The next step in learning the game, after the basics.","After learning the basics of Mah Jongg, Eleanor Whitney's book is the next step. Although most of the book actually covers the basics of the Japanese version of the game (along with most of the world wide variations), and the basics of scoring, Part Three, ""Strategy,"" is what moves this book to its true value. In this short, 50 page chapter are the basic, fundamental strategies which allow the raw beginner to become an informed, reasonably good player medium level player. Though this section is short, it is very dense, and bears reading several times. My own play has improved many fold by following Whitney's sound advice. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the stratigies of Mah Jongg and in playing the game as it really should be played."
3,A good introduction to the game of Mahjong,"Though the book is quite old. there are many good points in it, most of which would interest a beginner and get them to play more Mahjong. Parts of the book talk about a wide known rules and some forgotten ones.Clearly, a good book for any Mahjong player."
2,Butterfly Permanent Birthday Calendar,"I was a little disappointed when I received the calendar because it was printed on fairly lightweight paper stock. I also expected a page for each month, and it was laid out such that there are only 6 pages with back to back months. My friend, who I ultimately gave the calendar to, was happy with it, but it wasn't what I expected."
5,SABRINAS AWESOME!!,In Sabrina's secret life series sabrina is voiced by somebody else.But in the other show: sabrina the animated series she is voiced by the original sabrina melissa joan hart
3,Christy Change of Seasons,"The Movies summed up the tv series, but missed the original actors. They seemed to leave out a little of the original charm and did not think the sets were as beautiful as the tv series either but I enjoyed them any way."
2,Not the best...,"I love the book Christy and though I think it's usually hard for a tv or movie version of a book to totally live up to it's namesake, the first series did this job pretty well I think. This version, however, was overacted (Other than Dr. McNeil's character which I still think was acted pretty well),and the characters didn't have the heart and spirit that they did in the book. The overacting and poorly done camera work make what is a great story seem hokey and dumbed down. Also many of the characters aren't very well cast either. I don't recommend this version at all but still recommend the book and the other television version of this story."
4,Interesting stories,I rather liked this book as it has a slow flowing feel to it. On the surface all the stories have a slow moving rhythm to them that does not appear to have much meaning but if you look beyond there is a lot to see.
5,"Well-written, incisive and honest","I found D of D to be a very interesting and honest assessment of religious origins. Sutherland explores chronologically, from Judaism, to Christianity, to Islam, ending with Communism. The latter may seem peculiar given the scope of the discussion but it is apropos. Sutherland wants to explain why people act in a collective manner, what binds them. He also wants people to honestly examine and explore the reality behind the myths."
5,CAN'T GET ANY SIMPLER THAN THIS AND STILL TASTE GREAT,"FINALLY FOUND A ""SIMPLE"" AUTHENTIC MEXICAN RECIPE BOOK. ALL ARE EASY TO FOLLOW, DON'T REQUIRE EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS. FOUND MINE ON AMAZON FOR $5.00 FROM GOODWILL SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN NOR BEAT THAT PRICE. WILL UPDATE REVIEW WHEN I TRY THE RECIPES."
5,If you haven't got this you're not a Joe Jackson fan,Every now and then an artist will show his true genius. Here Joe Jackson has done just that by show how he can move from Pop to Jazz to Rock without missing a beat and doing it live without any remix. Mind blowing you have to have it in your collection
3,Badly in need of restoration,"The cinematographer for this film was the legendary four-time Oscar winner Joseph Ruttenberg. But sadly the film has suffered greatly over time, and was not restored before being digitized for DVD. Throughout the film, the color and brightness constantly change and flicker, to the point of being very distracting, not to mention disappointing. The storyline is a bit of a soap opera, made enjoyable by terrific actors and the wonderful Parisian scenery. But sadly, the deterioration of the film saps it of its vitality. I hope that one day it will be restored."
5,From a Time When Movies Were Original,"This is a classic not only for its genre but for its stars, Van Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor. A wonderful romantic drama with exquisitely detailed characters. True to the F. Scott Fitzgerald story with haunting performances and musical score. Van Johnson's best performance, unlike anything he's done before or since. Stays with you...Classic story, brilliant acting and something most contemporary movies lack today...originality and the ablility to keep audiences riveted without special effects, violence and other distasteful additions. Take a trip back to Hollywood's Golden Era..."
2,I Second That...Buyer Beware,"The movie was very good, I highly recommend watching it......just beware of this copy of it. Very grainy. Looks like a VCR transfer onto DVD."
1,Buyer Beware,It's no fault of Amazon but please beware before purchasing this title. This was a good movie and it's a shame no one has restored it yet. I really expected it to be much better. It looks like it was taken from an old 16MM print and just copied; too many times. It's very grainy and the sound is substandard. Maybe someday someone will do a good job of it.
2,Not up to par with previous seasons,"The Office's final season with Steve Carell just doesn't measure up to the past six seasons. Hard to tell why. It appears as if the characters are just going through the motions of ""getting finished"" with an episode. Still one of my favorite shows, but a bit of a disappointment. I hope James Spader adds a new spark to season eight."
5,The best series out there!,"Season 7 does not disappoint. As always, you love or hate the characters, but even the ones you hate you cheer for. Michael's leaving is cleverly accomplished, and his replacement is almost as cringe-worthy!"
2,Not one of their better episodes,This is an Erin heavy episode and for whatever reason her acting has gotten considerably worse with every episode. Has she maybe been given the news that she is getting the ax and just not trying anymore? We shall see.
3,"3 stars for cuteness, brand & price, minus 2 stars for comfort & problem heel","I bought these and they fit true to size, however, they are very stiff and the part of the shoe at the heel runs a bit high and created blisters at the top of my heel almost in my ankle area. Its a cute shoe for a picnic or party where you won't be doing much walking but due to the heel flaw is not suited for much else."
2,Too low,"Wish I had read the description better when I ordered. 72 oz is way too low for most service weapons. Better off spending a few dollars more and going with a different product, this one leaves much to be desired."
2,"GOOD PERFORMANCES, BUT POOR PRODUCTION","This video brings some very good voices. Pavarotti is not exactly the best Radames ever, but his performance is no less than good. The problem is the production itself. The scenery has no charm, the triumphal march is NO triumpahl march, and the ballet scenes are just dreadful. All production is very amateur and it is amazing that such an important theater like the La Scalla was not able to bring us anything better than this. I do NOT recommend it to anyone, even if you are a great Aida fan."
4,Gran Aida.,"A nivel general esta es una gran version de Aida, comenzando por la puesta en escena de LUCA RONCONI, bella y coherente visualmente en todo momento, sin los alardes tipicos de la obra, pero con un inteligente movimiento de figurantes.Luego, en el apartado vocal tenemos al sobresaliente Radames de LUCIANO PAVAROTTI, en uno de sus dias de gloria, a la poderosa Amneris de GHENA DIMITROVA (sin los medios de la Zajick, pero muy notable tambien) y a esos lujos para los papeles secundarios que se llaman PAATA BURDZULADZE (Ramfis), JUAN PONS (Amonasro) y NICOLAI GHIAUROV (Rey de Egipto), todos de lujo en sus respectivas partes.La Aida de MARIA CHIARA cumple bien, aunque no llega a arrebatar vocalmente, impone una presencia escenica bastante interesante. Aunque prefiero a Aprille Millo...LORIN MAZZEL lleva comodamente la direccion de los cuerpos estables de la Scalla de Milan, todos ellos muy ductiles, rematando asi una version de Aida bastante interesante."
3,The Spritual Path to Creativity is better,"This follow up to the Spiritual Path to Creativity is a decent book.The first book I would have to say is life changing.It helped me understand my creative self, why I was blocked and how to reconcile the past and embrace my future in the creative realm.It's great for writers, artists, performers, but not limited to that. It can benefit even those who do not think of themselves as creative.This second book, The Vein of Gold, did not add anything memorable, at least for me."
5,Very good source for discrete choice analysis,"This book is a very good source for someone who would like to study discrete choice analysis in depth. The presentation of the material is both intuitive and rigorous. In addition, the book contents are of interest to people in different disciplines, such as econometrics, transportation, and statistics.Viviana FernandezIndustrial EngineeringUniversity of Chile"
5,Tripp Lite surge protector,"I have always used surge protection for my audio and video equipment. Recently my friend told me about Tripp Lite--it is a company I was not familiar with, but after some research I am sold!! Tripp lite makes first class equipment at a very reasonable price. Why buy Monster equipment when you can get as good or better stuff from Tripp Lite for a much better price and the quality is seconf to none."
2,No line conditioning.,"I'm sure this model by Tripp Lite is very good at suppressing surges and what nots, but it does very little if any ac line conditioning at all. No noticeable differences were obtained on my television and sat receiver which has some small interference."
5,Hateful People,Thanks for everyone's negative comments about the Reba Sitcom... just makes me want to watch it MORE!!! I'm glad I'm a cheery person and can respect those who EARN respect.Note to self: keep an open mind and a positive attitude! Don't listen to those who do not contribute real feedback but only leave scrappy opinions (which they should apply to their own daily lives anyhow) : )
1,WAKE UP PEOPLE!!,Wake up and realize that this is the type of program that encourages immoral behavior. Enough said! Don't buy into this piece of garbage!
1,"I AGREE, NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SHOW!!","I agree, there is absolutely nothing to warrant my watching this program of mundane mediocrity. There are better sitcoms out there and this program certainly won't be in the list of ""classics"" when the history of television is accounted for. Reba McEntire is not a good actress. She's too actressy and too flamboyant in her portrayal which makes the people who play off of her look bad. The stories range from ""fair"" to ""poorly executed"". In all, there is nothing special about this show to make it stand out amongst the classic sitcoms of television history."
5,Awesome show,I bought all 4 seasons. I can't say enough good things about the show Reba. The cast is awesome together. This sitcom is the best I've seen in a long time.
4,Great DVD,"I bought this DVD set for my wife as she is a huge, huge Reba fan. She loves the Reba show.We did have problems with one of the DVD's being bad.It wouldn't play in any of three DVD players. Amazon replaced it immediately. It was one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.thank you amazon."
4,I liked this one....,"Ok, I've seen seasons 2-4 and not this season. I got It for christmas and I liked it, but nit LOVED it. I still liked it, but not as much as the other 3 seasons. I reccomend this, though."
1,No good Do not waste your money,I did not like because the device turn off as the dog walk. The switch is very sensitive to move and this include when I storage the device. Sometimes the light turn on and waste the battery. I have two dogs and I place the leash and all walking equipment together. Do not worth the money. I had a light collar that works better. I bought this to replaced one of my dogs night light. He likes roll in the snow and lost his light collar.
1,COMIC BOOK IS BETTER,Can ANYONE out there make a GOOD movie about this elite service of professionals?? I guess not. Don't waste your time or money with this dog!
1,I don't remember it being this bad,"But then, my tastes in movies have improved since I was fifteen. The plot is see through, and the dialogue seems to have been stolen from every Navy SEAL book they can find (more SEAL cliches than WWII movies). Sheen is as transparent as usual in the over-the-top 'badboy' SEAL, who any commander worth anything would have kicked off the Teams. Micheal Biehn and Bill Paxton (who only had a small part) are both excellent actors who just picked a bad movie (Biehn's SEAL role in The Rock is a much better portrayal). This movie came about after the SEALs came to the attention of the world, but a poor script, bad acting, and bad directing make this movie just horrible."
3,Blast from the past!,I purchased this dvd because it was one of my family's favorites when I was a kid - we were action film junkies! Now I watched it with my son and he liked it a lot too. Brought back good memories.
4,Ok,"I think this movie shows the true hard mission the un song heros go through. This was a good movie but the personalty of these seals was a little off. Also a couple stunts or actions done by these seals was a little off, a seal does not atract attention he is quite"
4,A movie for when we didn't have to be politically correct.,"Good, fun action flick. Fun to remember a time when every film review, or any kind of media review for that matter, didn't have to feel like a meeting of an ""Images of American Foreign Policy as Represented in Film -- A Marxist View"" class, And before we knew Shahid means martyr.Just a good action film where America wins. I like that."
1,Navy SEALS,"An awful movie, filled with all the worst sterotypes of SEALS as disobeident loners. If I were a SEAL, I would be offended. Unless you want to see this for the shooting and explosions, forget it."
2,i returned these,"when watching a movie and you want surround sound you shouldn't be distracted by the speakers cutting on and off every time the movie goes to one of those silent scenes. i was disappointed by this. not to mention the fact that i was getting static on one of my speakers even though the speaker was only 10 feet away from the antenna and the box said it has a range of up to 300 feet. to redeem this product, at higher volumes it does a pretty good job. you don't need to worry about tripping over wires. but if you are like me and want great sound at all volumes of the movie buy something else."
5,Don't judge a book by its cover.,"I admit, when I first saw the image of the movie, I thought that it would be a horrible movie about some scary girl seeking out revenge, BUT completely not what I thought. A low budget thriller/horror film that's great for a night at home with friends. Some of the acting may be cheesy, but gave me an adrenaline rush during the scary moments. If you have friends that love a laugh from a scary movie, must definitely show them this movie. They'll be laughing the whole time."
2,not what is expected,not the expected set of 3 Cd's this ityem is supposed to be a coopilation of 3 cd's not only one so no to satisfied with the product
2,Much Ado in the Moonlight,"This was my first Lynn Kurland novel. It began very different than the usual romance novels I have read, but quickly got boring. The relationship between the two main characters was almost platonic. No zip or fire between them at all. I had to force myself to finish the book. Will try other titles by her. i haven't given up on Ms. Kurland!"
3,Fans of the comic will not be disappointed,"Based on the excellent Faust: Love of the Damned comics from David Quinn and Tim Vigil, this film version won't disappoint fans. Brian Yuzna has some decent horror films under his belt, many considered cult classics, and he is at the top of his game here. In his screenwriting debut, David Quinn does a surprisingly decent job, and Yuzna works well with it. Production values are low, as could be expected with a budget of $2 million, but it all comes together. I saw this film at an art house a few month ago, actually, and was pleasantly surprised, especially being a reader of the comics. The look and feel is relatively the same, and the overall style matches well. The graphic sex and violence will no doubt be cut a bit (or a lot...) in this ""R"" version, which pretty much guarantees an unrated/cut version in the future. Overall, Faust is a decent horror movie, with symbolism and style."
4,Awright...,"... so this Faust doesn't live up to expectations. ""The graphic novel was way better"", they say. Yeah, sure, but this Brian Yuzna opus is chock-full of violence, gratuitous sex and surreal special fx (by Screamin' Mad George, the man behind the awesome transformations of Society). Ticks or Return of the Living Dead III it ain't (try it again, Yuzna), but it *is* definitely better and more amusing than some certified stinkers like Spawn or (yawn) the X-Men."
4,vertical mount needs foam sound deadening; cable bad,"Small rubber feet at corners not visible in photo provide sound deadening when resting flat, but the vertical mount clip transmits hum vibration -- you can feel with hand on unit running, from the rotation -- to tabletops. 1/4"" closed cell (denser, more durable) weatherstrip foam strips across ends works well, but not densest foam mounting tape. Apparently computer cases absorb this when drives mounted internally. Could be more a problem with 3.5 instead of 2.5"" drives.Handy because of both USB and eSATA jacks, cable included. Polished piano black and chrome.Supplied 3ft shielded, stiff eSATA cable did not work while a short, flexible one did -- the interface is good."
2,"""Witness"" meets ""Hired Hand""","I like Tim Daly. I like Naomi Watts. I did not like this picture. And, the message, if in fact there really was one here was simplistic. Everything about the movie was utterly predictable, the love story, the powerful landowners wanting to push out the religious pacifists. These greedy murderous bullies pull pretty much every dastardly act during the duration of this movie---and of course, they get their just desserts. But, having both main characters emerge from critical injuries which the town doctor (David Carradine) says they cannot survive seems a bit much. But, in this movie, love triumphs over greediness and religious fundamentalism. It is also sad to see both David and Keith Carradine in such meaningless roles. But, then, they never have been big stars, so I guess it is necessary to get work when you can. As Naomi Watts' star soars, I cannot imagine this film being much of the springboard to her apparent stardom."
4,The Outsider DVD,"In surfing through the channels one day, I came across this movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the portion I watched. I then decided to order the movie for my own personal collection so I could watch it from the beginning. I later discovered the book was on my own reading shelf, so I now have the book and movie. The moral of the movie: Don't judge others on outside appearances only."
3,Read It Instead,"I was disappointed with this screen adaptation of the novel by Penelope Williamson. Too many details left out. One gory detail left in that was not necessary. (When the doc removes the bullet from Johnny's side, the director left hardly anything to the imagination-ugh!!)"
3,"Koffee Brown Great Group, Could Use Better Material","I like Koffee Brown, I think that both Fonz and Vee have talent. The only thing I have against this album is the lack of lyrical quality. They will definetly be around for a while but to be a mainstay in R&B, they may want to look at some classic duets and get some tips. And stop singing about gold digging, paging some body, drop top whips and silly sh*t like that. As a couple they could have explored some serious topics."
3,"Bazooka subwoofer 8"" 150 watts","I purchased this Bazooka Sub Woofer for my Nephew for a Christmas gift. I received the Bazooka tube in time and there was a note stating that the Bazooka tube was sent seperatly so it would get here in time for Christmas and that the 150 watt amp would be coming along shortly just after Christmas. Well, it's been five weeks and I haven't heard or seen anything of the amplifier. I can't find the manufacturer to send them an e-mail to find out what happened to the rest of my order. I'm pissed.GB"
3,cute,I am finding it a little difficult to work out how to use it. But useful to have on the shelf for further investigation.
3,"Inches Only, Inaccurate description.","This item is a good item, but not as described. It says it is tenths on one side and inches on the other, but is in fact one sided with inches only. As a ""inches only"" grade rod, it is a good value for the price. The carrying case would not hold up to a construction site (thin material), but for around the home, it will do just fine. If you need an inexpensive grade rod, in inches only, this is it. If you will be using it for construction and it will spend alot of time in the field, this will still work, but you should likely get one with tenths of a foot, as this is what all surveyors use."
4,Great Help!,I found this book by Kress made me feel as if someone was right there beside me answering all of my questions and even anticipating my questions. She felt like a real helpful friend from the very beginning. I have started to look for other titles in the Fiction Series and hope they are as good.
4,The classics are 'improved',"A 'must' have disc for true fans. This disc shows the real genius (both lyrical and muscially) of the Mael brothers. Symphonic versions of their classic tracks (This Town..., #1 Song in Heaven) add another dimensions to the muscial side of Sparks. However, i feel some tracks (Angst In My Pants, Popularity, and #1 Song...) redone with a dance feel were a waste of time. The reworking of the original wasn't worth the effort and added little to the interpretation of the song. Still, a must have for the true fan."
5,Ollie and the Nightingales - a lost treasure,"If you are a fan of soul and R&B, Ollie and the Nightingales should be on your short list of must-hear groups. These Stax recordings highlight this little-known and short-lived group. Former gospel singers, they branched out into the realm of soul music and, with the help of the great producers at Stax, came up some fine recordings. This CD also includes some post-Ollie recordings of the Nightingales, which are excellent in their own right. It's a gem!"
2,A story that skims the top but never gets down and dirty,"This book will amuse the casual true crime reader, but the cognoscenti will laugh it off. Why these two reporters are being heralded for this book when it is merely a slapdash re-write of old Boston Globe articles is beyond me. Yes, the saga of the Bulger Brothers is indeed singular, but the real down and dirty story has yet to emerge, and probably will not until all parties are dead and buried. Someone who actually lived with the personalities and knows the piquant details will spill the real beans on this Boston drama someday - save your money for that book."
4,Who do you trust?,"This story focuses on a small group and a local area but does not really delve into the backgrounds of the people involved much.We don't know how these informants and their associated handlers came to be involved nor whether greed or revenge were the primary motivators.There have been many cases in the media over the years of govt employees exposing waste,corruption and things like that and who have been blackballed or set up because of it to put this in the realm of possibility."
4,Down and Out,"I know of someone who had the misfortune of working as a contractor for a company in the region of the Merrimack Valley FBI office when this case broke out. The person was harassed under suspicious circumstances and afterthat person left was blackballed on references by many of these coworkers there with strong political feelings during a period of gubernatorial and presidential elections. After this person left, this small group of workers was relocated ostensibly to another a building in another county. This person had all sorts of strange things happen when this case first exploded.One can only wonder what the family members of victims, informants, and fbi agents under suspicion are going through. Peter Limone was just released after 35 years in prison through the efforts of an unnamed informant.. but a question emerges as to why the informant's report only now became known?"
3,"Thrilling story, poorly edited","Big kudos for the hours of research that went into this book, and it reads like a thriller: impossible to put down. But, I got frustrated by the repetitious and often circuitous text. This could have, and should have, been more tightly edited. Still: pick it up and hang on for an amazing story"
4,Black Mass,A riveting true life account of corruption over decades. Bone chilling when you recognize one of the characters in this book.
4,"Intriguing, puzzling,scary, elusive","One thing not speculated on in this book is if Whitey had children who have been used as leverage to control him, perhaps raised in care of the Department of Social Services. Gov. Cellucci, who may be an indirect supporter of John Connolly, assigned the current Commissioner of DSS, Jeffrey Locke. If Whitey had a child, was this child targeted as the child attended the alma mater of agent John Morris? Has the child been systematically harassed and had their reputation destroyed in Massachusetts by either the government or perhaps rival mobsters or both? If there was a child, was the child prevented from finding work by screening their calls? If there was a child could it have become imperative to make the child look like a failure or less than spectacular performance in school? Was NSA, located where a Kennedy family member is governor, involved?Did the child seek help after receiving harassment from forces alleged to be loyal to Gov Cellucci and Scott Harshbarger?"
3,In bad faith,"I don't believe the FBI is looking for Whitey at all because the truth Whitey may possess is far worse than dealing with the murders alleged in the case. I know someone who has provided info that could shed a lot of light in this case and the FBI nor anyone else has acted on it. Instead, the person who provided it became the target of their harassment. The information could shed some light in either direction on the case."
5,It can't be true,"This book rips the door off its hinges on the back-room deals struck by the FBI's John Connolly and Whitey Bulger. The great lengths that Connolly went to cover Whitey's track will make your stomach turn. The writers capture that sense, back it up with hard evidence, and invite the reader into that dark place where the line between good and evil merge.O'Neill and Lehr have beaten everyone to the punch on a story that has never been told and will shock the senses. Black Mass is destined for greatness and is a book that was made for the big screen."
3,Feast of Weeks,"Kevin Weeks, in return for testimony against Bulger and Flemmi gets minimum prison time and to keep his lottery winnings while Bulger's sister is unable to keep Bulger's portion of Lottery winnings. The Justice Dept wants to get Bulger so bad that it is willing to basically forgive murders to get him while the FBI paints a picture of Bulger as so dangerous that it seems less likely he will be taken alive."
4,black mass,great book to read. I couldn't put it down. Not sure which side to belive. Will read more on Whitey.
5,outstanding,"This book is an outstanding photographic treasure and accompanying story! Beautifully done and much appreciated, a GREAT gift!"
2,Why are All Reviews for a Different Product??????,"Ok, the fantasy may be wonderful... but I wouldn't know because I ordered this and that's not what this product is!!!!!! I ordered it expecting a delightful book for my granddaughter, and what I got was a teacher's resource book!!! Looking back I see the publisher's reviews say ""Hardcover edition"". Frankly I think there's some sort of bait and switch going on here!!!!!!!!!!! Jeez, folks, review the right product! I'm pretty disgusted as I have come to rely on the reviewers."
5,Beautifully done,This is a beautiful book with both excellent photographs and good thoughts. It is proof that simple things can be a means of conveying great ideas. Well done and highly recommended to teach values to children.
5,Soul Children,"a great group from one of my favorite record labels ""Stax""..this group really put they all in all in both these albums..kinda hard to say which is my favorite because ive enjoyed all these hits"
2,"Next writer, please.","While I at first eagerly awaited Winick's arrival on a book I had been reading for some time, I found his Green Lantern simply bad. In our first issue, we are introduced to a variety of new supporting characters we don't care about. I didn't mind the new faces as much as I thought it was kind of forced on me. I also thought the character Nero was a hollow antagonist, and while a good effort to give Kyle an arch-nemesis, it just didn't work.On the other hand, the art is well done, and does much to solidify an otherwise weak story.Winick may have done great work in the world of personal drama, but it doesn't transfer into super-hero success. Next writer, please."
3,The most Interesting Book You Never Want To Read,"...a copy of this belongs in every major library, not necessarily in everyone's library. Excessively detailed and turgid, it is yet another story of the bomb(s) and the major players who developed it.Better reads would be Richard Rhodes' amazing books on the atomic bomb and hydrogen boms and various biographies of Oppenheimer.And don't forget the terrific mini-series on Oppenheimer, by the same name, re-released on dvd by the BBC, unfortunately in Region 2 format only. Watch this if you can."
3,Interesting Subject - Not An Easy Read,"This is the story of the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb and the brotherhood of men whose genius created the bomb. While the story is very interesting, the text is difficult to read. The book has excellent photographs of the period which are just amazing to see. The book has over 80 pages of notes and looks like some kind of legal paper."
4,Typographical errors numerous and annoying,"Really enjoyed this escapist story and recommend it, but the Kindle version is a mess. There are many typographical errors, quite a few of which interfere with understanding. A word like ""learn"" can be written as ""barn"" causing the reader to stop reading to try to figure out what the word is supposed to be as what appears is obviously wrong. This happens distractingly often and detracted from my enjoyment. A disservice to an otherwise good story."
4,Jeffrey does it again,"What I like about Jeffrey Archer is that not only does he put in the suspense but he also writes in a very free flowing manner. At the end of the day when I want to relax with a good book, it is Jeffrey Archer."
4,Why ain't there a movie already?!,"The elementary school kid yours truly found this appealing! The plot is tight and taut; the tension's there and the explosive action! The ""government secret"" bit is really cool, and you've never read more fresh characters! This book rocks!"
4,Another Page Turner,"Another real page turner by Archer. Not his best but for those of us Archer fans, it was a fun read."
5,A really compelling page turner!,Archer's mastery of suspense and allowing the hero to not prevent all the bad things from happening made the book seem real. I can't wait to read him again!
4,WOW!!! Well written,"This is the first time that I have read this author and I will be anxiously waiting more of his work.This espionage thriller is constantly moving from country to country and from character to character. It is exciting to follow and keeps you on your toes.I particularly like that you could actually hear the ""voices"" of the different characters. The Russian and the Brit had different tones. Fun to read.Just when you think that you have it figured out - something new pops up and you are off again on a mad rush around the continent."
1,predictable at best...,not only was the story completely predictable but the author gave away major plot points way earlier then necessary. I felt the story lacked a lot of supporting detail to really round out the story. major dissappointment after all the good reviews. Also felt that there were some major mistakes in the electronic version...words that did not make sense etc...
5,Highly recommend,"Love it! I highly recommend this to anyone who is seeking a clear vinyl tablecloth. The vinyl is strong, but not stiff. It looks very nice and works well with or without a tablecloth underneath. I have put it over an embroidered tablecloth that my grandmother made to protect it. If you're looking for a vinyl table cloth, I highly recommend this one!"
4,If you like Gabaldon & Donati....,than you will like Canham. She has great romance as well as historically interesting reading. I love this whole series.
2,fragile,"I was real excited to get this action figure because I wanted to display him with my other christmas decorations. But as soon as I took him out of the package and attempted to move his leg, it broke right off. I am not very happy about it. This toy is not very will made. VERY fragile. Just be careful when handling it!"
1,This is definately the stupidest movie I've ever seen,"The writer of this film can't possibly be any more than maybe 14 years old. It's crude, insensitive humor was more about bad taste, than humor. I guess I'm having a hard time appreciating humor anymore and yet I myself speak in cynical but positive humor all day, always cracking people up.Comedy use to be more intelligent. This movie was just stupid, period! What a serious waste of my time. I didn't think that anything could be worse than ""Tropic Thunder"" but I guess I was wrong."
3,Top of the WUURLD,"Top of the World is a great movie. It is a comedy with no comedic talent. But, it made me laugh many times. You wont find it in hardly any rental stores, and not at Walmart. I found my copy in a dumpster at a storage facility. I admire the hilarity of the scenes with their intended effect, NOT TO BE BELIEVABLE. And my other comment, You dont get to see Tia Carrara's legs at all. She must have been busy with baby. or something. Overall a great ham-n- egg commedy, would have better if they had cast Jeff FoxWorthy, Larry the CableGuy, Carrot Top, in the major male roles, but you cant have everything."
1,Not for my hair type.,"The comb just doesn't get hot enough for my hair type (1a/1b). I have to blow dry it straight to have any chance of getting this comb through my hair, which effectively makes it useless."
2,Not sure what to expect,"I had never purchased a hot comb before. I own several flat irons and expected the comb to work essencially the same but without having to clamp the irons. It arrived brand new and on time so that was good. It also got very hot which was good. It didn't straighten like I thought it would. It kind of combed out the curls but it was still very fluffy. It was not what I expected. **This may be true of all hot combs, not just the one I purchased."
2,Not satisfied,"The whole idea for me to purchase this item was to prevent me from burning my hair out from using the hot combs heated by the stove. However, this item didn't get hot enough to straighten my hair & my hair type is fairly curly. This was a waiste of money and unfortunately, my electric flat irons from Chi got hotter than this electric comb. I suggest you save your money or buy a different brand."
1,south pacific,"i had ordered this movie cause i remember going to the theatre when i was a teenager and i loved it. well i got the movie and started to watch it and it was just all music,i was disippointed and so i sent it back. i have never re-ordered that movie again. i was the one whom did this wrong,i just didnt read the description well."
3,there were parts that the color was not right an it made the film not clear,"poor quality copying I was not pleased with the purchase, I tried buying another video, The sound of music and it was worse, there was a background sound that mede the viewing very annoying"
3,Excellent quaility DVD,The DVD and cover were presented well in a cardboard sleeve. The DVD itself was of an excellent sound and colour quaility.
5,Great Musical,I love the music and the extras tell the story about the story very well.Blu-ray really rocks
4,South Pacific,Great for a movie that old. Don't like the use of tinted filters for mood setting but other than that a wonderful movie - beautiful filming and excellent music and sound.
1,Wrong Format,Probably not vendor's fault but this international format will not play on either of my two DVD players. I did not see any mention on the website but I was not looking as I assumed it was the USA format.
1,Quality deteriorated--desperately needs restoring and digital remastering,"This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007. I returned this DVD to the seller."
4,South Pacific if still a great movie!,I bought South Pacific because I saw the stage show of South Pacific and I just loved the Mitzi Gaynor Rosani Brazzi movie. I am sharing this movie with all my friends that saw the stage show. The music is fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
4,Roadshow looks more like road kill,"Yes, leave it to Fox to first screw up the Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! on DVD, and now the roadshow version of South Pacific (disc 2). As other reviewers have commented, Fox spliced the additional roadshow segments into the movie with virtually no restoration. So you go from film frames with brilliant technicolor to others with washed out color, and even film that is at times out of sync. The effect? Simply horrible!!! Yet another brilliant move by Fox.....NOT!!!! Just what I expected from a studio that is only interested in making money rather than preserving a musical national treasure. I just shudder to think what they did to Carousel. Stay tuned, I've yet to review it."
1,Should be titled Terrible Pacific.,Film quality wss poor as was the editing. Would return if I could.Edited out most of Brazzis singing which is highlight of show. We had way too much of Mitzi Gaynor.
4,'Feng Shui-ed'!!,"This is a wonderful book on Feng Shui. Other feng shui books are way over my head but this one is in ""plain"" English. Great ideas!!"
2,Decent content hidden by simplistic and giddy writing,"If you are simply looking for a book that can tell you the practical ways you can bring feng shui into your life, and you don't care about the tone in which the book is written, then you may like this book. I, however, was very put off by the silly, almost giddy way the author writes. The minute I read that the Love/Relationship corner of a house is the area you want to work on if you're looking for a ""shagadelic good time,"" I was done. Now I am off I go to try to find a book that treats the art of feng shui, and those who are interested enough in the world around them to learn about it, in a more respectful way."
5,The most wonderful way to change your life!,"I needed to help my family focus on what is most important in life. This book helped us. We cleared the clutter... (including the dreaded garage) ...took away the ""stuff"" we didn't need and even got rid of the annoying ""boyfriend from hell""! Our home never felt calmer and I finally understand feng shui.Karen Carter is a hoot to read. Buy the book!"
1,A lot of Nonsense,"I purchase several feng shui books and this one was the easiest to understand. However, nothing happened after purchasing several hundred dollars of feng shui items. Instead it seems bad things were happening to me. I junked all the stuff. I think it's total nonsense and more like witchcraft...stay away from it."
1,never received my order!,"i still have not received my order. My address is 1130 Toledano St, New Orleans, La 70115."
2,Painful to Watch,"Scarecrow is about a high school student who is tormented by his peers, his teachers, and his mother's boyfriend. Late one night, his mother's boyfriend murders the teen in a field near a scarecrow. The teen's soul possess the scarecrow and he wants revenge on his tormenters.The premise sounds interesting, but the movie is horrible to watch thanks to the bad acting, dialogue, and camera shots. The actor who plays the main character looks like he is 40 and the other teens look like they are closer to 30! All I could do was just laugh at the stupidity of the casting. I prefer to watch the sequelScarecrow Slayerover this garbage."
2,What could have been,"I hoped for an atmospheric, suspenseful and classy horror movie, but unfortunately none of those qualities are found here. All the characters are caricatures, the tongue in cheek humor falls flat, and the overdone, often grotesque acting grates. The gore is fine, but the stalking scenes have no buildup and no tension, so it's hard to care. This could have been so much more - the elements for a good horror show are here, including nice photography and special effects, but there is no solid foundation to lay them on. Those who crave gore for its own sake probably won't be disappointed, but more discerning horror fans will only be frustrated by all the missed possibilities in Scarecrow."
2,Mediocre,Lots of ho-hum ideas about motivating employees. I don't think it's worth the money or time.
4,Creativity is the key!,"Often we aren't able to think creatively when we try to reward and affirm employees, but do so on a limited budget. This book is a great way to spark thought along those lines."
5,Must have item for every Company library !,"It is extremely creative, offering high budget, low budgetand NO BUDGET ideas for recognizing employees as wellas suggestions on when and how in order for the programs tobe most effective. The company anecdotes are great!(comments from HRNET posting)"
2,Eh,"I did not like this product, directions kind of hard to use, I would for sure try a different product next time!"
3,Not as expected,"I have previously had the exact image that is pictured here, however this is not what I received. I received two rolls wrapped in foil without the plastic dispenser or the paper insert shown in the picture. In fact there wasn't anything besides the two rolls wrapped in foil. I am happy that I received two rolls rather than one, but I wonder if this product may be old. The color of the paper is a little slow to change color and I found this to be true with the previous roll that I had as the roll aged."
1,Ph Test Strips Dispenser,"No,no,no!!! Flimsy, ticky tacky waste of money. I'd advise you to buythe more sturdy individual test sticks. If you tend to be verybusy (like me) but have to keep an eye on your ph (urine) 3 or 4 times a day,this roll dispenser is more trouble than it's worth......"
3,"Nice looking, came with sub-par hardware","I bought and installed two robe hooks last night in our bathroom. They are very nice to look at and were a great solution for us when we needed a place to hang our towels with not enough wall space for a towel bar. Also, it matches our Victorian faucets nicely.However, the installation of the first hook was frustrating as the anchors and screws that came with the hooks were of poor quality and did not work properly. The anchor should expand to cling to the inside of the drywall in the hole you drill; however, the screw was too big for the anchor, and it would not work properly. We had to make a trip to the home improvement warehouse in search of new anchors and screws. Once that mission was complete the installation for the second hook was a breeze, and they seem very sturdily fixed to the wall.PS: If you do try to mount the hook with the included anchors and screws, I would suggest using a slightly smaller drill bit than the instruction suggest (1/4"")."
1,This is no diamond in the rough...,"I'm not sure why I decided to buy this flick - probably the low price and the positive reviews.It turned out to be a mistake.This movie is awful. Although I like ""B"" movies and direct-to-video titles that are fun to watch, either because of a good storyline or great actors, this movie has none of those things. The story is weak, the acting is uninspired, and the direction is atrocious.Those reviews saying this movie is awesome have to be shills - no way. AVOID."
5,Classic,I ordered this movie for my daughter. It is a fantastic movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family
5,A wonderful collectable,"This is for the true ""Sound of Music"" fan. This was given to me as a Christmas gift. I love all of contents, as you can see, in the description. What a nice gift. A must have for the true ""Sound of Music"" fan."
5,~The hills are alive with the Sound of Music!!~,"This movie was fantabulous!! Great songs, great actors, and great everything!It's a real life story, it really happened. It is about a woman named Maria(Julia Andrews) and she is a not-so good novice nun in the Abbey. The Reverend Mother then sends her to Salzburg since a motherless Von Trap family needed a governess to take care of its seven children. (wow!) The Captain(Christopher Plummer) is very strict and it's up to Maria to brighten the family up. It ends with the family in danger from the Nazi as they flee from Austria. The songs are magnificent and I love the ""Do Re Mi"" and the main song ""Sound of Music"".The Austrian scenery is very beautiful and I'm really sure anybody would enjoy this film!"
1,Don't do it! Don't order this! It doesn't work!,"Don't order this! It doesn't work. I ordered it for a birthday present. It didn't work. Lovely. Not only did I give a gift that does not work, I get to return it. Skip the grief."
1,The Sound of Mucus,"Sickeningly sweet, and relentlessly cheerful, the continuing endurance of this movie baffles me beyond belief. By now the story is well known -- young woman becomes governess to seven children in 1930's Austria. Their father is a stern captain who has known no joy since his wife's death. Said young woman spontaneously bursts into song, the children adore her, and the captain finds joy again until the Nazi's put an end to their fun at which point they escape Austria. Even Maria Von Trapp, the woman on whose life this story was based, did not care for this film and it is amazing that it is not required to come with a saccharine warning label."
2,Disaapointed,I was mad when I found out it was only a Region 2 movie only.. so i can't play it on any dvd player!
5,The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition),This is a wonderful movie portraying the life of the von Trapp family during WWII. The sound and visuals are stunning and the extra disc is packed full of great information. The extra disc also includes a marvelous back-story behind the production of the movie as well as the story of the real von Trapp family. Everyone must own this classic movie.
3,Classic movie,"This movie is uplifting, optimistic, and cheerful in the best way. I wanted to purchase the DVD so my children could enjoy the movie and music the way I did when I was little. There are lots of bonus items: a musical box, postcards, a book about the history of the movie, etc... This is what I regret. I should have just bought the DVD without all the extras (if you are an uber-fan you might want all these items as part of your collection). However, I know I'll simply watch the movie and not touch the other items which makes it a waste of materials and money. It was a great price considering what they put into the collection, though."
4,Where is THE SOUND OF AMERICAN MUSIC hosted by Mary Martin?,"The amazon.com product description indicated the documentary, THE SOUND OF AMERICAN MUSIC hosted by Martin, is included in the package. I did not find it in mine. Anyone else have that problem?"
3,Its is what it is.,"An outdated Musical DVD CLASSIC, that has no relevance anymore, but brings back memories if you are 60 or older."
3,The Sound of Music DVD,"This is such a wonderful movie and I was so very disappointed that the DVD picture quality was not better. I found myself squinting my eyes throughout the movie to try to get it into focus, but it did not work. I would like to see the original again on the big screen to have something to compare to the DVD. The Sound quality was OK, no complaints there."
2,My wife made me watch this...,"...and I could have gone the rest of my life without having seen it. It was cheesy, slow in spots, and way too much singing. It was hard to see what the whole point of it was. I did like the nuns, though. They were great. I really didn't care anything about the characters and the movie was off the scale in terms of realism. I know this is based on a true story, but the whole singing just ruined any shred of hope and realism for this movie. I must have made my wife mad to have her torture me with this!"
5,The Sound of Music,The film was the first time I saw it on BluRay. I can't believe how perfect the scenery was. The picture was perfect. I'm glad that I bought the BluRay version. Amazon had great service. Will buy from them again..
3,there is a crucial scene left out,"I have always loved ""The Sound of Music"", but unfortunately every version of the film (except for once on TV) leaves out a very important bit of dialogue between the Baroness and ""Uncle Max"" when she states, ""As a matter of influence, the person you should be talking to is me. Oh, he hasn't asked me to marry him yet, (referring to the Captain) but he will. Then we'll see who gets credit for getting those children in the festival."" I may not be stating these lines verbatim, but you get the idea. This little speech is a testament to the Baroness's true character, and yet it has been left out. This is not good and I cannot for the life of me understand why this bit has been edited out yet again. I hope maybe one day I can find a version where this part has not been deleted, but until then, I will do without having this film in my DVD collection."
5,The Sound of Music Five Star Collection,"This is Truly well worth the money, not only for die hard SOM fans but those who truly appreciate Austrian History, culture, music and song--A collection of the century."
5,Sound of Music,"An excellent family moovie with lots of beautiful songs and music.It'll warm the hearts of both old and young and will take you to the world of kindness,music,green mountains and laughter. A great moovie that will leave you crying and laughing,stirring the best in everyone."
3,"The Blu-ray is bad, it's not playable.","The picture of the blu-ray is terable, it's not playable.It destroyed my confidence for all blu-ray product.The DVD is good."
5,This film is what blu ray should always be like,"We watched the film through. Then we watched it again with the Robert Wise commentary track. Then we watched it again with the Julie Andrews commentary track and then re watched selected parts yet again. The film is beautiful. The color balance is superb, the images clear and detailed. The sound is fine with reasonable channel separation. This is the definitive version of this great movie and an example of what Blu ray can, but often doesn't, do."
1,Blue ray would not play this! Said I need an update for my player! What? So I couldn't watch my DVD! that money down the drain!,"The DVD would not play in my new Blue Ray Player.It said I need an upgrade on my player to play it!What?I tryed to go on line to find out what I needed to do. But what they told me to do,,,I tried, and it would not work!What have they done to the DVD to make people like me not be able to just put the DVD into the player and play.That's a lot of money down the drain for me!!!!Very unpleased!"
1,You MUST Be Kidding,"When I see garbage like this, I finally understand what is wrong with the world. I watched this movie on a dare and was absolutely mortified!!!!! I would have given it negative stars if I could have. As an animal lover and vegetarian, I was especially offended!!! Anyone who is a fan of this series should run, not walk to the nearest Psychiatrist. You are in desperate need of having your head examined. And we as a society wonder why violence and seriel killers have become a part of daily life. Well, ladies and gentlemen I present to you Exhibit A......."
1,Good concept - lousy performance,"This is a great concept, providing the convenience of not having to measure detergent for every load. Too bad:* Clothes come out as dirty as they go in* Ball seems to be getting used up much faster than expected* Product is very difficult to get into the rubber ball, a problem for normal people which I would expect would make it impossible for people with arthritis."
