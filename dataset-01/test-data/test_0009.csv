5,"Exquisite Writing, Creative Plots","I bought this book for the Lora Leigh story, and it was good, but I was more impressed by two others - Falling for Anthony (Meljean Brook) and The Countess' Pleasure (Emma Holly). Both were stunningly creative in a genre (erotic paranormal) that is increasingly becoming dominated by stale plots. Both of these stories were set in interesting worlds, both were extremely well written, both made me want to read more by these authors. It's tough to create a unique milieu in a short story - Lora Leigh (who I love) has the benefit of a devoted following to a lengthy series, and Shiloh Walker writes a variation on the vampire myth, but the other two deftly sketch complicated, very original worlds and draw you into the characters. ...And the initial, no-touch sex scene in TCP about melted the page - my toes are still curled."
2,Missing an item from my order,I received the Rosetta Stone Latina America almost two weeks from the day of purchase. However I did not receive the coupon for the free Rosetta Stone language of my choice as promised. I have sent the seller note about the status of coupon but I haven't heard anything yet.*Here is a copy of the seller advertisement note on Amazon:1 of: Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 Personal Edition (Latin America)Condition: Used - Like NewSeller note: I will include level 3 as a free bonus and include a coupon for a free additional language of your choice!!! I bought this software to open my learning center and never saved enough money to buy a building. Includes software only. Manuals are located in the application disk as .pdf files. ( less )
4,The Feel Good Book,I use this book in my children's psychiatric inpatient groups as an intro to our lesson on remembering things that feel good and give pleasure. They love talking about the pleasures they have experienced and recalling that there is happiness in their lives....positive psychology approach.
3,unhappy end,"when bought this book as a fan of C.Lamb, expected a happy end, also passion and pain etc...But disappointed a bit. Yes there was a love but with a wrong man,yes there was a passion but not enough (of course it should be that with a wrong man) and yes there was a entrique but don't need a murder issue when want to read a love story. Sure it is not only a love story but also a mystery fiction."
2,Stricly for beginners and Americans traveling to Cuba,"This is a book to be avoided by aficionados, since it is very basic and general in its approach and adds absolutely no new information to that which can be found in previously published books and magazine articles.The author would have done better by presenting this book as a personal diary rather than a book which is supposed to supply information as to why Cubans are ""The Ultimate Cigars."""
4,A great story teller tells a great true story,"Alan Moorehead does wonders with the story of Charles Darwin aboard the HMS Beagle. This is a very readable version of the voyage for the non-biologist and the non-sailor. Other accounts of the story (including Darwin's) can be tedious to the casual reader, but this reads like an adventure novel. The book uses many direct quotes and MANY illustrations made during and immediately after the voyage. This text with these illustrations brought together makes a wonderful presentation of one of the most important voyages in history."
3,Easy,"I bought this game so we could have a family night, after playing the originally Scene It? from good will. The originally was so challenging I thought this would be a fun change. I was mistaken, I either mis-judged my knowledge of Disney, or the questions on this game are 100x easier than the originally Scene It.Bottom line, if you want a challenge, do not play this with a 90s kid."
5,Nuestras Canciones,"The voice is well matched with the melody. I like the vocal changes she has made on some of the ""Canciones"", especially ""La Llorona"". Her pitch was great--"
2,They should break up,"After 3 years and some changes (among them, they booted their longtime bass player), Catherine Wheel have made their most boring record. Although ""Mad Dog"" is a fantastic song, the rest of the LP sounds good initially but carries no real substance. ""Wishville"" will not stand the test of time of say, ""Chrome"" or ""Adam and Eve"". If this record is an indication of things to come, Catherine Wheel should call it a day and move on. They were once the best band in the world, they shouldn't fade away with records like this."
4,Wishville Thinking,"The best Catherine Wheel album? No, not by a long shot. That title will always be shared by ""Chrome"" and ""Adam and Eve."" Most CW CD's take atleast a few listens to sink in and grow on you, but ""Wishville"" takes longer than most. Still there's a lot of good things to be heard: The sheer power of ""Sparks are Gonna' Fly,"" the graceful yet tough ""Gasoline,"" the strings of ""Idle Life."" Yes, ""Ballad of a running man,"" and ""All of That"" are definitely among the bottom rung of CW songs, but keep in mind that even CW's bottom rung is better than most bands best. Hopefully, they will continue putting out great music for years to come."
3,"Good, not Great","During their career, Catherine Wheel have sparkled with brilliance on many occasions. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The album starts off strong, but loses steam quickly. In style, ""Wishville"" is a lot like ""Adam and Eve"". But whereas ""Adam and Eve"" was almost astonishing in its ability to effortlessly take you to extreme emotional highs and lows, ""Wishville"" is just a good rock album. When compared to the Wheel's best, it leaves you craving for something more. If you like Catherine Wheel already, its probably worth getting. There are some worthy songs, but if you are a Catherine Wheel virgin, stick with ""Ferment"" or ""Adam and Eve"""
2,.....what happened?,"truly a disappointment. and that's only because Catherine Wheel need to be held at a very high standard. they have produced some fine masterpieces in the past, culminating with the show (and heart) -stopping Adam and Eve. additionally, when you have the huge talents of Tim Friese-Greene at your disposal (he created a large part of two other masterpieces, Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock - get them), you best not surface with mediocrity. well, they have. there's no texture, no diversions, no heavily-lidded emotion, no cathartic, blissful moments of sound.new record label..... firing of their bassist (? )..... many bands have tried to shake things up mid-career, hate to see another talented one follow the same fate.i'm still a fan, but this album will surely go to the bottom of (the) Catherine Wheel bin for me."
4,judging without prejudice,"This is just a fantastic album. It soars with beautiful songs, sung and played just right. Somewhat introverted compared to earlier releases but judging this on it's own merits, I can just say it is one of those albums that grabs me and never lets go. The balance is always there between melody, guitars, bass and drums and the result is draws you in like for instance the Grateful Dead could do with it's finer live performances."
2,Collapsing stars,"Wow, this one just hurts.Amazing band, simply stunning in concert, and now this.I hope they'll rebound. Stranger things have happened. For the moment, though, this stands among the most disappointing releases ever by a band that has had so much to offer in the past.""Sparks are Gonna Fly"" and ""What We Want to Believe In"" are the only songs which led me to give this album even two stars, and even those decent tracks are but an echo of their predecessors.When your B-side compilation is more inspiring than your new release, you know you're in trouble. So it is with Catherine Wheel."
5,Plano Protector Single Pistol Case,"I just got my case in. Came on time as usual, Thanks amazon! The only thing bad I have to say is that a local store has it for $6.99. Other than that it is exactly what I wanted, my SR9, clips and fits well."
5,Great,"Great little case for the price. Fits revolver with 2"" barrel, gun lock, speed loader just fine. Cushioning is good. Just what I wanted."
5,Great Value For The Money!,"I bought five of these several months ago and was pleasantly surprised to find them to be even better quality than I anticipated. In fact I like them so well, I am ordering two more! Each of these will hold a standard size or smaller automatic (in holster) plus at least two additional magazines or a snub nose revolver (in holster) plus two speed loaders. Excellent value for the money!"
3,Plano Case - okay,It's not quite as rigid as I might have expected. I have not tried to get on board an aircraft with it as yet. That will really tell the tale. It does seem to meet the requirements.
4,"Cold War warrior, armed with a typewriter, fighting liars","MacInnes often has a main character who is a journalist, struggling to fight against lies being circulated into the media by Communist-controlled or -inspired writers. In this novel, we may have her clearest portrayal of writer as freedom fighter, fighting to expose the hidden sources of anit-American journalists. There is her usual element of romance, as well as the gifted amateurs who take on the trained operatives, and win. And always I enjoy her carefully crafted writing; she was a lot more than a writer of ""action"" novels.This book has been less popular than many of her others, but it's one of my favorites."
2,Horse Pills!,I ordered the softgel form of this pill because I cannot easily swallow the regular capsules. I was horrified when I opened the bottle. They are 3 times the size of any normal pill and the daily serving size is 3 pills per day to get the 400mg dose. I will not be taking these horse pills.
5,not an expert but everything seems good,I am not an expert on nutritional supplements but everything seems good. Came well sealed and appears as it should. My doctor has me taking Magnesium Citrate while on HCG weight loss diet. I purchased these to save money from buying directly from his office at around $15 for 30 pills. Lost 40 pounds so far and 40 more to go.
5,Great Death Metal,What can I say; this is easily one of the most technically impressive and musically engaging metal CDs I have heard in the past few years. I consider it to be on par with some of the finer works of the genre. I would encourage any fan of death metal to at least listen to this.
5,"Excellent Read, Excellent Recipes",Texas Ties is a great read and a must have for cookbook collectors. The family stories are all very warm and include some cooking tips I haven't seen anywhere else. The Comfort Foods section is unique. The recipes include all fresh ingredients - upscale recipes for the ordinary cook. Every recipe has turned out great.
1,"Has potential, BUT...!","I remember when I bought this how angry I was that it did not come with a power adapter. What kind of a company would do that? Then, the power button did not work. I returned it two times. Same thing! I'm sure other parents had the same problem therefore. Indeed, reviews bear this out. This toy or company won awards I think. I couldn't believe it! Several years later, I just tried using it again for my younger children. Now, even the controllers do not work well. The games themselves also have a very low budget ""feel"" to them. The whole thing is junk. As a result, I decided I will never buy any vtech product again, phones included, and have not since. Too, bad, the toy had potential to be a good learning tool."
1,"Great Product, Awful Service From AMazon","The product itself I can't complain about, considering, I haven't gotten it yet, Thanks to Amazons awful service. I ordered this on November 10th. 10 days later they tell me the order is delayed, and it will only ship after December 25th. 1 Month Delay. Cool. Does it get better? Yes it does. I continue looking into it. They tell me, their only shipping it on APRIL 21st!. FIVE Months delay!? No thanks, you lost your money and your customer, this is ridiculous."
3,Still seems geared for gear-heads,"Sure, you can download 'repositories' - but why not just call them applications? And why do I have to worry about dependencies. Come on. It should be a toaster. The Palm is a toaster with thousands of cool little programs to add in that do all sorts of silly little things, like an egg timer.For what I needed, its fine. I get my home email and read it on the way to work. I can surf anywhere where there's free wireless. I can write notes. But the freedom to explore cool little programs just isn't there. And, as much as I think I would like to develop my own programs, I don't have the inclination to really dive in. Some day perhaps there will be the following as strong as Palm. Until then, realize that you are getting a cool small internet ready toy."
5,foxfire,"This movie has perfect casting (espically hunky Billy Petersen). I was on the edge of my seat as I watched Nicki (Reese Witherspoon), become more deeply involved with Mark Walberg's character. Although I thought I knew the outcome of the movie the way it occured had me clapping! What a fitting ending for Walberg's nasty character. It's a hold your breath ending that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat."
1,Fear Movie (soundtrack),I am so upset that you didn't have the correct sound track that i was looking for. I love the Moive fear w/(Mark W.) I was looking for this one song that they have in there. Who ever is looking for the sound track be carful and do not perchase this sound tract unless you know the songs that you are looking for.
1,Umm... Nah,"Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet. Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father. And so on... we've all seen this before. It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though. Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like ""Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action."" And so he does. And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature 1hr. 16min. Woohoo.Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like."
2,This is a very old production,The first chapters are in black and white. The newest car shown in the movie is a '56 Ford. When it progresses to the life of Jesus it changes to color but is very poor in photography and all aspects of production. There must be newer stories of the new testament. Find them.
5,Tremendous value for the money...,"Tremendous speaker! The construction is top notch and the installation is simple and uncomplicated. Both the appearance and manufacture of the product is top notch. I strongly recommend this product over the competitors for these features, and because of the exceptional reasonable cost. Simply the best product for the money available today."
3,Too damaged to rate,"The speakers are absolutely beautiful and are built solid. The connectors are heavy duty and gold plated. These speakers weigh a ton!Unfortunately, I can not tell you how these speakers sound. I only have one of them. Both of the speakers I were sent were damaged (shipped separately). One so severely, that the front panel would not attach and I had to send it back.It has been 3 weeks, and I still don't have my replacement. Although speakers are available online from an Amazon partner, Amazon won't ship me a replacement until they receive them in stock from their supplier. They also won't take back the other 7 speakers in the set. For someone spending over several thousand dollars on a set of speakers, I would expect better service. I feel very let down by this order."
5,Good Sound,"I bought these because I trust JBL. I have a pair of JBL Decade L-26 speakers that are 33 years old and going strong. Originally I was going to buy some Polks and use them as my rear channel. I listened to the JBL Venue series and was not too impressed, the Studio L's blew them away. They sounded so good my old JBL's will be the rear channel now."
2,Rlowe,"The speakers carry mid and high range fairly well, however, they lack a serious bottom end. If you are looking for strong low range, look elsewhere."
1,Fooled!,"I bought this book based on the description found on a book club's web page - which mentioned nothing about a ""Flooded Earth Scenario"". So, the book arrives, and it turns out that ARK is nothing more than another ""out there"" propaganda piece churned out from one of the graduates of the ""Al Gore Institute for the Literary Insane""."
1,Cheap Product,"Had to return, not what I expected. Cheap price cheap product. You get what you pay for. Base is plastic with some type of covering that was chipped. Plus a 25% restocking charge."
5,A Landmark Album,"It is hard to believe that an album of this breadth and vision did not chart well. Released in 1967, it is one of the two best Byrds albums ever ( along with The Notorious Byrd Brothers ). Its' combination of folk rock psychedelia is nothing short of mesmerizing. David Crosby is at his zenith here. His song Everybody's Been Burned is perhaps the finest Byrds composition ever. Chris Hillman emerges from nowhere with a newly found song writing ability, contributing several strong tracks. As usual Roger McGuinn's ever present 12 string brings the whole album together. This is truly a landmark album of the pschedelic era, although it seems to have maintained a freshness and has aged well."
5,"mono, has the punch but stereo is necessary too","They're both needed for a true Byrds nut. If only the decision makers on the previous stereo remasters had taken advantage of also including a mono mix. It probably could have even fit on one disc, mono, stereo, bonuses, everything. The Kinks appear to be doing it right, even though they're doing it on 2 disc deluxe versions. Bottom line: mono has the power and stereo has the fidelity, they're both worthwhile. Having said that, if you can only reasonably acquire one, go with the stereo and bonuses, first."
4,Great For All Ages,This book is great for all ages. I am not young but found it fascinating and intrigging.
5,With God in Russia,"These 433 pages went too fast. This book is an informative, enjoyable, easy reading that gives an insight into the nature of a person whose center is God. Walter Ciszek is an inspiration to let go of anger and hatred in order to always be ready to make friends, do go works and be immediately free when your burden is finally lifted."
1,not delivered,thanks for nothing. I sent this product to Qatar. now some random guy in Vegas has a new prisma color art set for free. and there is no way I can contact anyone. $230 right Out the window.
1,INCOMPLETE!!!,THE BOX CAME WITH 1 MISSING MARKER AND 1 REPEATED!! THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND INSTEAD OF SATISFYING THE BUYERS THEY STEAL FROM THEM!!!
1,Too Violent,"No details or rating provided about the content of this movie. More than half of the movie shows ongoing violence including fires, whipping, slavery and cruelty. I also found it interesting that one of the girl elephants white panties were always being shown. I would never have purchased this video had there been any indication of its true content."
5,childhood favorite,had to replace my VHS copy eventually...I was so excited to find it on DVD and now my kids love the movie too!!
4,Ok for some children,"I first viewed Babar The Movie when it was released in cinemas, then about six years old and looked to purchase this for my children, as some say even the series had mild violence but it's no Watership Down; it depends on your child, I recall it stirred me and made me sad at times when I was a child but that's why it became a part of my heart, Babar is a sentimental epic, sit down and watch it with your children like my father did with me, you are destined to enjoy it with an open mind."
2,North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperbacks Library),This particular printing may be authentic to the period but the print is very difficult to read. It is dizzying.
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed getting Anne Lindbergh's point of view regarding the press, and what it was like to fly with her husband. It was truely a different time, and she described the transition from pre-aviation to a fully connected world very well."
3,"Great quality, ability to charge is questionable","The sound and connection quality of the iLuv is MUCH better than the 8-in-one that we previously bought. We can keep a connection when we find a radio station, even if the station is staticky and not completely free (it is hard to find a completely free radio station in our city). We have used this product with an ipod 2nd generation, iphone 3GS and iphone 4. It worked great with the ipod, no issues, but with the 3GS and iphone 4, I don't think the iLuv charges the phones. We constantly get a quiet beeping sound that makes it sound like it is connecting/disconnecting from charge. This is annoying!! If anyone has ideas about how to get around this or make the charge work for our phones, please let me know!!"
1,kumenhe32,It didn't last as long as I thought and wasn't as sturdy as I would like. I wouldn't recommend this transmitter because the light on the digital setting blew. The end that plugs into the cigarette lighter was not tight. I need something with a little more quality.
2,No luv for this lousy transmitter,"Clunky, awkward, touchy and full of static. That pretty much sums it up. I had to contort it into a weird angle to keep it out of the way of the gear shift, particularly since if you tap on it in any way it disconnects and takes forever to connect again. A bump in the road will disconnect, a wayward breeze will disconnect. There is no auto scan so you are on your own finding a station and out of all of them not a one was without static. It comes with a hard extender to give you more space, but this only worsens the disconnect feature as now there is more open air for your ipod to bounce around in."
4,"Easy, Hands Free, Works Great",It was easy to use right out of the box. The directions were a bit unclear but it wasn't hard to figure out. I like that it's hands free and I don't have to worry about it sliding away from me as if it were on a cord. I love that it keeps my iPod charged while playing. I've used it in multiple cars and I like that it swivels and has the option to extend. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
4,very good transmitter,"I got this after my Monster transmitter started having some issues - probably due to cord damage. After some research, I bought this one since it also charges the iPod. It doesn't limit which stations you can choose, like some and I have no problem finding a good frequency. Only get static occasionally, which I've heard is a big problem in cities. I've only had it about a month, so I can't attest to its durability, but so far I am very happy with it - haven't had to charge my iPod inside for weeks!"
1,died after 8 months,"Worked nicely for 8 months then failed. Warranty period for parts is one year, warranty period for labor 90 days. Bottom line it's e-waste."
3,swim,water seems to be trapped in the net area. i supposed the netting material becomes dense and heavy so it does not float well on water. it creates a small puddle of water in front of the baby. My 6-month old baby girl gets water in her mouth all the time. not very functional for smaller babies. Recommend for older babies.
5,Best baby floating device around,This is a wonderful floating device for our 1 1/2 year old grandson. He is able to sit in it without having any bulky or hot vinyl separating his arms from the water. It's perfectly stable so there was no worry about it tipping over. The mesh allows for child to keep a small toy within reach. Surpasses anything else I've seen for this age group. Highly recommended.
4,Sturdy and comfortable but...,"We had a hard time folding it back up. The main problem was getting it to deflate. I am sure we just didn't do it right, so it wouldn't fold back up with air still in it.My 1 year old daughter preferred a baby boat with an attached toy bar she could chew on and play with, but her 1 yr old cousin tried this float and enjoyed it.The child sits down in the water pretty good- which is nice for keeping cool. It seems to be quite stable, as a result. I will continue to use this float with my baby girl and see how she likes it as she gets a little bigger."
2,NOT SAFE!!,"Althought the aspect of being able to splash in the water is what drew me to this float, my 10 month old equally enjoyed the ease of climbing out of the float. I bought this for our vacation and because it was so dangerous I ended up holding her the entire time we were in the water! Buyer beware!!"
2,Waste of money,"It would be safer to have just held my son. We thought this was cool becasue we wouldn't have to blow it up, but no....that's not the problem, now the problem is he just falls forward so his face is in the water....! I'd much rather waste my breath to blow up a floater so my son can keep his breath free of water. Nice waste of money, if they ever redesign this, the need to try to make it more stable. It's not like we just stuck him in there once & gave up on it, we've tried this thing over & over again months upon months to see if maybe it was his age...nope it's the item, even when other children try it, it's the same thing. Please don't buy this & look away from your child for a second, you could be making a horrible mistake."
1,Baby Spring Float - Very Dangerous Floation Device,"If you have an active child, this is not the floation device to buy. My granddaughter almost drowned. The float flipped over and the weight of the float held her head under water. Even with very short reaction time to flip the float back over, she was terrifed and now is afraid of the water. I threw the Baby Spring Float in the trash. I know it is better than most floation products on the market, but I would rather hold her in the pool, than have her drown."
1,Useless old stock...,Received an old shell plate for the Hornady LockNLoad without the EZject... Had to send it to Hornady for warranty replacement because everyone is selling the old shellplate in the cardboard box (not the new plastic one). Hornady says it's their screw up (Hornady's) because the part number never changed. Vendors probably don;t know enough (or are too big) to check and update their stock.Lesson learned: Check that you are buying the version you need.
5,home-brewed appalacian goodness,"Thank Jesus for this record. Actually I'll thank Rick Brockner, Cora Beth Bridges, Marty Koehler, and Jan Johansson for this one. Beautiful arrangements preformed with classic accoustic formulas rich with history. Surprisingly, only one song contains any vocals, but they are beautiful and give the first song ""Where John Used to be"" a perfect setting mood for the rest of the album. Every song is spot on perfect and flows seamlessly with the next song. That sure is some good ol' black mountain brew, I'll tell ye' boy. Hey, the front cover even screams ""cozy mountain music."""
1,A quest for the absurd.,"I tried. I watched Quest For Fire three times and then put itout at the curb with the rest of the trash. If you knew nothingabout evolution or thought the Three Stooges was high art, youmight like this. Sorry"
3,Hot!,"Rae Dawn Chong is hot in this, despite being covered in ashes, & having no words to say (except 'caveman' language)."
1,WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL!!,"Maybe 30+ years ago I saw a movie titled ""Quest For Fire"" and thought it was EXCELLENT. The subject came up in conversation and I wanted to show it to my wife and some friends. I went to Amazon(dot)com and immediately found this title.When I saw the the movie, I was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED! Apparently, this is a modern re-make of the original by that God-forsaken Michael Moore.The plot of this crappy re-make very loosely follows the original, BUT, has been added to in VERY WEIRD and crazy ways that totally detract from the original. A bunch of very juvenile voodoo crap along with extra violence that does not add to the original plot at all.VERY DISAPPOINTED! Would LOVE to find a copy of the original. Anybody know where I could find it>>"
4,Quest for Fire,Been looking for a copy of this for some time. Very interesting story line if you like the evolutionary aspect of it. Its not a rockum sockum adventure movie but a very good watch.
3,Omissions,There was no real acting required in this movie just some pre-historical type movement but I found Rae Dawn Chongs portrayal of an exotic off-shoot pre-human tribe somewhat convincing. There were omissions from this movie that appeared in the original one that I noticed when the timeline in the movie reached the period where they would have appeared. The ape-humans looked a little too modern to be convincing.
3,Darwin goes ape,"Make no mistake about it, this is the grunt-fest of all grunt-fests. I mean this puppy makes you wish you were descended from water buffaloes or something. Just think ""Animal House"" in caves, wearing bear skins, and acting almost as crude with orgasmic glee. There is one dirty little beast that is pretty sexy though, and uninhibited, if you can picture that. I've known some guys who would date her without a second thought. Anyway, you better go into this one without any kind of an agenda, or you're bound to hate it for one reason or another. If they all didn't look like they just crawled out of a mammoth's dung heap, I think I could have enjoyed it more, but that's just me. Personally, I liked ""One Million Years BC"" a lot better. It didn't leave a funny taste in my mouth."
3,Great acting - poor makeup,"Last saw this movie about 17 years ago. Just watched it again and while I still thought it was great, the effects and makeup are pretty bad. The lesser developed tribes look like they're wearing rubber masks (which they probably were) and the mastodons are pretty humorous. During the fight with the bear - there is never a time when the bear actually looks like he's attacking. It just looks like the two are playing with drastic camera angles and cuts to make it look dramatic. All that said, I still enjoyed this film immensely. The actors really make you believe you're watch events thousands of years ago. The body language, grunts, and limited language are perfect throughout. Very entertaining and worth watching."
4,You'll go ape over this DVD!,"You might think I'm bananas, but the lack of dialogue and etiquitte really appeal to my simean nature. If you want to nurture your inner primal child, buy it while supplies last!"
2,Uninspired,"Relative to ""War all the Time"" and ""Full Collapse"", ""A City by the Light Divided"" is a huge disappointment. Maybe it's in the production or maybe the songs are simply not as well written, but the entire release lacks the melody and hooks that are prevalent in the earlier material. The Other Side of the Crash is clearly an attempt to build on Understanding in a Car Crash, but without the urgency and punch. There are a few decent cuts, such as Running from the Rain, but mostly the band sounds uninspired."
1,Blows,"Anyone who thinks War All The Time or even Full Collapse aren't as good as City are CRAZY! This record SUCKS fat balls. The mixing is terrible, and you can't hear geoffs voice in half of the songs. I didn't like Waiting, but I still think its better than this one. This is thursday at their worst.PS - Why has every follow-up from one or more of my favorite bands SUCKED this year? I mean, first there's Thrice. Then Yellowcard. Then Atreyu. Then hoobastank. Then less than jake. And now Thursday? Hopefully the Underoath record won't suck, but I'm not holding my breathe."
2,Disappointing,"I also have been a huge Thursday fan, but ""A City by the Light Divided"" simply does not have the clout and teeth that ""War all the Time"" showed. The album just never seems to pick up the pace after the single, and immediately loses the listener's interest. My advice to anyone who is a Thursday fan would be to: 1) Buy the album--show your support of the band, 2) Listen to it once and generate your own opinion, 3) Type your review on amazon.com, and 4) Put ""War all the Time"" back in your player."
1,Kindle version has problems,"This Kindle version of the book has quite a few typographical errors. I could usually make them out, but it IS irritating. This review is for this version of the book not ""Boots And Saddles"" itself (which I found to be a very enjoyable read!)."
4,looper endears with lofi creativity,"Looper, apparently doomed to forever live in the shadow of that other Scottish band (and no I'm not talking about Arab Strap) have released an album that follows up one of the quirkiest, but also cutest, recordings of last year. As unlikely as it sounds, I found some of the songs on this cd to have a decidedly pop mentality (which in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing). Mondo 77 and bugrain are all instantly memorable and seem to reverberate through your head for days to come, but I think the real strength of this album is These Things, a song whose touching lyrics and gentle beat and melody begs to be listened to again and again. I wouldn't want to be misleading though, because I don't think this is a perfect album, just a good one, some songs scream filler, and one utterly misguided. These are faults that most albums are succeptible too, and ones that can be forgiven considering the strength of the rest of the album."
2,Not Worth It,"The shirt looks great in the package, but I found its fabric to be very thin. It was difficult to iron, and by the time I got to work it looked like I had slept in it. I bought 3, and I'm looking for a way to get rid of the 2 that I haven't opened yet."
4,Excellent shirt!,"I buy shirts for my husband very often. This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $10. I'd guess it retails for around $35. Excellent packaging and fabric quality. Note: can't be worn without a white t-shirt. Also, be careful when removing the pins. And lastly- it isn't wrinkle-free, although it has 60% poly. Would recommend to anyone who has to wear crisp white shirts and throw them away in 2 mos time:)"
1,"Video works kinda, No Sound","I got it a Few days ago i tried it with a Wii PS3 and a 360 the Color comes through fine but a White flicker across the whole screen making the device unusable and i haven't even got to the sound yet the sound doesn't work on any of the 3 channels. Im not sure what the first reviewer was on but the Isolation is horrid. Im really no surprised for $5 i really get what you pay for. The only thing i can say is the company does ship their products with haste i got it before i expected it, thats all i can say that was good."
3,Present for father,This was a present for my father. He likes moves like this but he seldom gets to watch them on tv. This is the only place I can find old movies like this.
2,Compared to the first one - this is pretty bad and here's why .....,"The first movie being ofcourse 'King Solomon's Mines' (released two years before this one in 1985 - also starring Richard Chamberlain, Sharon Stone).'Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold' is rather flat compared to the first one. the problem is that the 'Lost City of Gold' is missing the all around sense of fun that was present before and is simply not as clever in its sense of humor (although in the first half it did have its moments).The second half of this movie (when they actually get to the 'Lost City of Gold') is simply awful.And there is a completely cheesy and unnecessary scene in which Allan Quatermain shoots and kills a lion. In the first movie the 'lion scene' is realistic but delightful.So, if you liked this one (hey, its possible) or if you didn't, try 'King Solomon's Mines'!!peace out-CrowTurtle"
1,"must not see, should not see!","lousy screenplay, bad casting resulted in bad acting, this movie not only cliched but will bore you to death. we were fooled by some moronic reviews and got this one. but, by george, after struggled 35 minutes, this stupid movie almost bored us to death. political thriller? give me a break! senator campaign rehearsal in the mountain retreat, then smoking joints, taking l.s.d., obviously didn't die from drug overdose. how could it possible to have this kind of campaign woman on board? then wife found out, then...who cares! one of the worst, bore-to-death movies. don't waste your time, keep away from this movie, put yourself in hiding, in seclusion."
1,Showersafe cast,"I didn't recommend this product. Its too expensive and doesn't serve the purpose. I was waiting for this product for two weeks to arrive at my house, to use it after my bonion surgery and I was very disappointed it broke the first day and my both feet get wet and I end up throwing in the garbage and insteadI used garbage bags to cover my feet in the shower. I truly believe that this product should be removed from the market and I deserve my money back."
5,Best at home mud bath...,I've used Auromere Mudbath before....it's awesome!! Your skin will thank you. It smells good and everything is self contained. Highly recommend.
3,Good enough,"My skin feel fresh and clean after use. It's a good product but I don't notice a difference from the Aztec clay, which is a lot cheaper."
5,Increible!!! : ),"Me encanta!!! Trato de leerlo todas las noches antes de dormir... Me conecta' con todos aquellos ferbientes creyente que mencionan en la biblia,,,, nos hablas las maravilla de la ORACION!!!! Alabado sea nuestro DIOS!!!!"
5,Good for motorcycle exhaust,"I used this stuff on a Honda Rebel 450 head pipe exhaust leak. It worked better than expected. I applied it, installed the head pipes and the rest of the exhaust system. I then let it set over night. No more leaks. I really expected the heat from the exhaust at the head to burn through this stuff but, it lasted till I sold the motorcycle a couple of years, and many road trips later. May still be going strong for all I know."
3,THANK YOU SONG,"The thank you song is by Dido on her No Angel album. It is entitled ""Thank You"". I hope this helps. :)"
2,Thank You song,"Fot those who are wondering the ""Thank You"" song is by Dido on the No Angel disc. Apparently not on this one though."
3,who sings the thank you song?,"This cd is great, but I was really hoping that the Thank you song would be on it, and its not. Does anyone know who performs this? (its the one playing during the scene between Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon Stone!) thanks!"
3,Essentially a Reprint of Mountain Interval,"Classic Robert Frost - probably the preeminent American ""modern"" poet. This is a reprint of Mountain Interval in the original format."
4,"Great album, some new style elements","If you like everyting else Strung Out has done, you'll like this. Though not a huge departure from their previous efforts, the occasional slower tempos further explore the direction they hinted at with Twisted by Design, and makes you anticipate their next full length... which is what a good EP is supposed to do. Definitely worth the price."
3,Blunderer McGee,"I'm a huge fan of the Travis McGee series, but I urge you to be careful with this one. For the first 250 pages, McGee makes solid choices and dodges all the bullets. However, he makes a fatal blunder at the end that any reader could see coming a mile away. I was powerless to stop it, solely at the mercy of MacDonald's writing. McGee's blunder gets the main girl hurt really bad. I suffered from borderline post-traumatic stress for the rest of the evening after finishing this book. Be careful, and know what you're getting into before investing time in this book."
4,Pretty good overall,"As a Bible answer book, it is pretty good overall. There were some verses that I was hoping to find in here that I found to be puzzling, but I was disappointed that they did not make it into the book. Also, I didn't necessarily agree with all the answers given. But I suppose when you have a puzzling verse, many people will not agree on what it means. Just understand as you read the book that the author isn't all-knowing and while they may present good theories or food for thought, these answers aren't necessarily authoritative. However, the majority of the book was good, interesting, and well written."
2,TogetherI did not like this movie,I did not like this movie. I have sure seen a lot betterseen a lot better Swedish movies.
1,Stay Away - What a Joke,"This has ""sort of"" worked one time. After that, the battery does not re-charge or hold a charge. Just when you really need it for a school project for your child. I am now stuck with two boxes of glue sticks, a glue gun that won't heat up and a charger/battery that makes it look like it is charging...basically a pile plastic and parts. Go with the standard corded."
1,Breakable Plastic inner parts,Not a great glue gun. Must treat it very gently or the trigger handle that forces the glue stick forward will break. Cheaply made>
1,Not worth the money!!!,"I've had my unit for a few weeks and have not been able to get more than 15-20 minutes of use from it until it needed to be recharged. Now it appears the battery will not take a charge or the charger is not charging. When I place the battery on the charger it blinks, which indicates it's charging. After hours of charging the light turns solid, which means the battery is fully charged. I place the battery on the glue gun and the low battery lights up and the gun will not heat at all. This product is useless. I went to WalMart and bought a $5 gun that works much better. Save your time and money and do not purchase this product."
1,No replacement policy,"Got this gun in January. By March, the trigger was broken. The company was no help. I asked to order another...they took the credit card and no gun. I ordered in June after exhausting local suppliers. In August, I called Coldheat. The gun was backordered. It is October...I just called...no help...still don't know when they will get the gun to me. I'm hoping that the credit card info remains secure. I was ""gun ho"" (sorry) about the product until the company's lack of information made me uneasy. They still advertising on their site, with no product nor product in sight!"
1,COLDHEAT Glue Gun Battery Life Blows,"I, like many other reviewers, had this for a very short time when the batteries stopped holding a charge. The unit looks like it's new, but is useless. Wish I had thought to return it to Costco (where I bought it) earlier than after using 6 months. Don't waste your money on this product. Very disappointing."
1,Murder in the Family: Honor Killings in America,"Loved what I saw on the televised version. I went through two discs, however, that wouldn't play on any of my DVD players, only got a refund on one. A Muslim in their copy department? Order at your peril."
5,My favorite EH cd,"Every song is a gem and arranged by Bebu Silvetti. EH voice lends itself to the latin flavor of this cd....romance and rhythem. Yours and It's All Beause of You are amoung my favorites. This cd is out of print, and can be costly, but every EH devotee should have this cd in their collection. The insert is attractive, but then again anything with his image is attractive...still a hunk!"
5,short and to the point,This book provides easy and fun to read advice for business oriented writing. It is short but still full of real life examples.It is worth reading it just for the pleasure of reading.
2,Uncertain,"Michael Levy's books have helpful information, however, after a while I got frustrated with all his poetry. To me, it distracted from the point of what I was reading."
5,Cheaper by the Dozen,This book was a gift for my daughter. She is reading parts of it to her children. They love it.
4,Totally Loveable,"The real Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were much more interesting than the Bakers that were portrayed in the recent movie.This book was written by some of the older members of the Gilbreth clan, so it has plenty of good, old-fashioned laughs. No (real) violence and no sex makes it a great read for all ages. Although the book switches back and forth between years in the lives of this remarkable family, it is altogether well-written. You will want more stories of the Clan long after you finish this quick read."
5,I loved this book!!!!,"I thought this book was full of excietment and fun to read a real thriller!!!! It got you on the edge of your set and kept on hanging!!!! I will read this to my kids and I am sure they will love it just as much as I did the first time I read it. I wish every one felt the way I did and would scroll up and by this book, not because I told you or someone else but because you want to share the wise teaching this book has to offer. Don't let this book pass you by!!! So buy it today!!!"
1,Removed from context this book falls flat.,As a modern reader I found the tone of Eliot to not only be didactic but insultingly so. With every nuance so pointed in its intentions the characters and action are devoid of any impact. One cannot help that feel this is clearly a novel that has aged badly for the simple reasons that its very heavy handed message is old hat and obviously the original audience for this novel was one of lower education standards than today. As a simple book written to carry a message this is one of the weaker Eliot novels for the modern audience to read.
1,Worst book ever written,"Whenever anyone asks me for books I really hate, this one is topof the list. The author digs and deeper and deeper pit forthe main characters. Life gets more and more depressing.For a while this is ok because you are trying to guess howshe'll concoct some sort of sensible ending. Slowly it dawnsthat the characters are never going to get out of the pit, sotheres nothing left to read for. Ending is depressing,pretending to be deep (almost a pun there, for those whoknow what happens), and theres just no reason to read this book.Just to prove that I'm not biased against the author .. Irecommend Silas Marner which is a *good* book."
4,"Lengthy, but worth it","This was a really sad, but really great novel. Granted, it's not an action packed novel, but if you like Dickens or Austen, and have a shred of patience (the novel is lengthy) you'll like this novel, too. I really felt for Maggie and her unrelenting desire to be loved and accepted by her family. Unfortunately, the way she goes about trying to earn their love and affections doesn't turn out the way she wants it to. This novel has it's share of melodrama, as much Victorian literature does. I liked this novel particularly because it doesn't center around passion/romance (although it has that too), but the love and closeness of family, and what a woman will do in order to have that. The characters in this novel are well written, and as shocked as I was by the ending, I thought it was really good. I was satisfied because finally there is a point in the story where I think Maggie was truly happy. I recommend this read wholeheartedly."
1,Loved the Movie but not the book,"I like to read books that I can actually understand. I can not understand the language in this book..I guess I'm just calling myself ignorant, but thats the truth. I loved the PBS movie, its a great story but the book just isn't for me."
2,I just can't stand it!,"I loved Middlemarch so thought I would continue an effort to read ""great books"" with Mill on the Floss. I'm almost to the end and am considering abandoning the effort. What began as charming and amazing has become an incessant drone of intentional unhappiness and misery. I've lost all patience with the novel and its characters. Reader, beware. If I drew a graph chart, it would start high, then dive downward with only infrequent, tiny pulses upward."
4,Live Ella is the best Ella,"I was never too much of an Ella fan until I heard one of her live recordings. I had always respected her technical ability, but hadn't found the emotion and passion I was also looking for. With her live recordings, it's all there and grabs you in a way her other stuff may not always do. You can feel how present she is in the music and her improvisations on ""Mack the Knife"" are priceless, including an impression of Louie Armstrong that's spot-on! She also scats like crazy and her polite little thank yous between numbers are terribly charming in contrast to some of the vocal feats she performs during her songs. Well worth it for fans and nonfans alike!"
4,Hope it works!!,"Everything that I have read leads me to beleave that this supplement may help stave off dementia. These capsules are easy to swallow, so I'v added them to my dailey vitamin and supplement regimen."
5,A book that deepens your faith & transforms your family life,"This is a great book for all Catholics, but it is an essential book for Catholic fathers, like me. At the center of the modern crisis in family life is a crisis of genuine fatherhood. The essence of restoring fatherhood is turning the hearts of fathers back to God the Father. The renewal of family life will proceed from the renewal of our life with the Father. Read this important slowly and prayerfully. It will deepen your faith and transform your family life"
5,I apologize,"Yes, Billy, I'm the one who should apologize for not getting on here and recommending this album to folks sooner. I came across this smoky voice on the Juke Box of Moe's Pancake House at Sylvan Beach in the 60's, and listening to this now makes me yearn for a return of the martini generation. (not to be confused with this NEW imitation 'martini-made-with-with -sucker-liquors kind of martinis.) Cars with fins - polyester pants, and shiny shoes----where did they go?"
5,The Best Dog Pacifiers,"These are GREAT...esp. for dogs with joint problems (natural cartilege...?sp),my three dogs (two rescues) LOVE them!!! A great value too."
5,forget raymond chandler & jim thompson. this is the real deal.,"on the back of my copy there is a blurb from kurt vonnegut jr that says this is ""surely the great american prison novel."" well, i haven't read a whole lot of prison literature, but i would love to find another book of this kind and calibur. ""on the yard"" soars with a strong narrative drive and a large cast of interesting & fully developed characters. in my life's reading, edward bunker's memoir ""education of a felon"" is the only comparable peer that this book has in american crime writing. great stuff. i now very much look forward to reading mr braly's memoir ""false starts."""
5,I love dancing with Homer,This toy is very fun to play with. Homer moves his hips and head to the music. So much fun my kids are not allowed to touch Homer.
2,just okay,This product is not great. It is a really small quantity for the price. It does go on your face smoothly and feels silky but it does not really add anything to my face care process. I finished the lotion and moved onto a different one and had no change in how my face feels or looks. I think you can get a better product for less money elsewhere.
3,OK but Expensive,It works OK but if it works for you Buy replacements ASAP!!!Never have any available or on Sale...
3,School,"Bought it for school, it was the same price as the other Heart of Darkness books, however this one had another story from Conrad lodged in it, so I went for this one.Can't say I actually like the book. Had to read it for class. It was too drawling for me. The protagonist seemed intent on drawing out every statements in mundane rants. There was a decent message in there, but the style of writing is very difficult to swallow. It was like trudging through molasses attempting to read this... It's such a short book, took me 2 weeks!!"
2,"Great flexibility, poor manufacturing quality","Although these cables give you a lot of options, the spring-loaded storage discs are rather poor in quality. Getting the cables to retract fully takes several minutes and a lot of tinkering. This would be an invaluable tool overall if they just used a higher quality wind-up device."
1,Worst buy for sure,"Very poor quality. Wires seems easily breakable and there are pointy edges on the earphones, which almost cut me when I tried them. Definitely would not trust this brand/manufacturer at all."
1,Atrocious quality,"This kit is the single worst quality product of anything that I have ever bought tech related. The first gentle pull of the cable broke or jammed the retract mechanism so now I have a thin usb cable with a big piece of plastic in the middle. The plastic that houses the mechanism even splits apart just extending the cable. The connectors are convenient, as is the case, but the retract mechanism and casing are laughably bad. I have bought foreign made knockoffs of many items that had higher quality than these. I am normally very hard to irritate, but man these irritate me. This kit is NOT recommended."
1,SUCKATHON!,"This album was terrible. It was as if Chick was talking to his wife and said, ""Hey baby, why don't you sing on my album?"" and she was all like, ""Ok, but I really don't know how to sing."" Don't buy this album. As a beginning Chick fan, I thought that all Chick Corea albums were good. I was dead wrong. After listening to this album, I was downright embarrassed for Chick, because I knew that he would look back on that album years into the future and just frown. Do yourself a favor and buy something better like Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, or even the disco album, Where Have I Known You Before? Spare yourself the humility"
1,Worst Toy Ever,this toy is just horible. it dosn't even do anything. what is the world coming to? the best thing you can do with it is to play fetch with your dog.(sticks are much cheaper though....they are actaully free!)well you can't even do magic with them.
2,not needed,I ordered this thinking it was needed for the magic kit I ordered. It was just a plastic stick. One was included. In the kit I ordered.
2,Great if your only Marine VHF Radio.,"This is a great VHF Marine radio if it is the only one on your vessel. DSC feature works well, NMEA interface is easy to wire in. Audio from speaker is excellent. However, it has no RF shielding and interferes with another IC-M602 and every other piece of comm gear aboard so I can't rate it any higher. Great for a pleasure boat that will have this as their only radio. The remote handset feature is great. (This is an additional option you must buy.)"
2,"Why, why, why?","Award winning literature should provoke thoughtful questions. Susan Sontag's ""In America"" prompted my bookclub to ask: 1) Where the heck was her editor? 2) Was it simply Susan Sontag's turn to win the National Book Award? 3) If ""In America"" was penned by an unknown author, would it have even been published? 4) Did the guy who was quoted on the back cover actually read the book? Would he please tell us where the ""hilarious"" parts are? 5) Why did the chapters that were 1 paragraph yet 17+ pages long irritate us so? 6) Does a single interesting premise like ""Immigrating to a new country allows you to reinvent yourself"" merit 387 tedious pages? and finally 7) Why the heck did our bookclub pick this book?"
5,What a blast!,"This CD is a party on a little silver disc! If you don't find yourself dancing at some point during this CD, you might be dead!"
2,Stereo installition kit - Hyundai,The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces. There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio. Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws. Seems to be holding soo far.
5,"inspiring, enjoyable, a celebration",I was fortunate enough to see this work in its beginning stages. The poetry was always there but I got to see the poems loose and then grouped various ways. They took on a differrent life every time the grouping changed. And the final work which became the book was more impressive than anything I saw before!! I have read and re-read much of it. I suggest you mark your favorites for quick bursts of inspiration or humor or reflection during the day. And not forget that it is worth re-readingn as your life will change just as the authors and there is always a comfort and a sympathy somewhere in the pages!! Hats off to all involved. This is a do not miss and to my knowledge a one of a kind!!
1,Horrible,"I don't even know what I watched...how did anyone get funding to make and produce garbage like this, and why would AMAZON choose to carry it (do they screen these things first?)."
3,Worth every penny,"This case protects the phone from scratches and also comes with a belt clip. It is a very inexpensive case, and it does its job. However, you get what you pay for. If you would like to pay a little more, I would recommend purchasing a krussel leather case. It protects the keys on the phone, and its a little nicer looking. The leather is a little nicer that this plastic case."
5,"Handel - Hercules, Musical Drama in Three Acts (HWV 60)","Handel - Hercules, Musical Drama in Three Acts (HWV 60) is a recording under the direction of Marc Minkowski who leads the Les Musixiwna Du Louvre on this Archiv Produktion and was recorded in 2002. The booklet is a quite a work of art with many fine drawings from the time of Handel along several fine photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. The liner-notes have been written Donald Burrows and are very well-written and informative. The lyrics are available in German, English and French. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,One of the best TV soundtracks around,"Brilliant compilation, my favourite of the three One Tree Hill soundtracks by far. There is a great mix of melodies, beats and ideas on the cd, which makes it an interesting listen. My favourite track seems to change from week to week, but at the moment I am loving: Don't Wait (Dashboard Confessional), You'll Ask For Me (Tyler Hilton) and World Spins Madly On (The Weepies).I hadn't heard of a lot of the artists before I bought this cd, but honestly it is fantastic. Give it a go, even if you aren't a big One Tree Hill fan (it isn't my favourite show, though it is quite addictive!)"
4,My alterior motive,I bought this cd because I enjoy Arabic music but most of all to support the artist who contributes to an organization that promotes Peace with Israel.
5,Great fun for toddlers!,"Santa brought this toy for my 19 month old twins and they love it! Very cute and fairly easy to assemble, ""Lightning"" has quickly become a member of the family. He gets good night kisses each night and several rides per day."
3,"Stiff Springs, Hard to Get On/Off Of","I was surprised at how stiff the springs are. Once installed, there is virtually no give downward, and the rocking motion isn't very smooth. Maybe with use it will loosen up.It is also hard for my child to get on/off of it. There is a horizontal cross-bar that's needs to be climbed over, or stood on to get onto the horse. If my son climbs over it, he doesn't have room to get up without toppling backward. If he climbs onto it to flop onto the horse, he loses his balance. Maybe not a problem for a 3 year old, but my 2 year old hasn't conquered it yet.Positives - horse's fur, mane and tail is soft. The funny sounds it makes and song aren't too annoying. It doesn't take up as much room as other rocking springy horses I've seen.Negatives - including the above, the price. Not worth the money. Needs to be about $30 cheaper"
3,Assembly not easy,"Someone said it took HER 15 min w/help of her 2 year old son and should take anyone else 10 minutes. Not so. We are experienced toy ""putter-togetherers"" and it was an hour. There's no way I'd be able to do it all by myself because it required a lot of strength to try and stretch the springs into place. My husband could barely do it and he's not some girly type either. He works out regularly and isn't small."
5,The Book The Racist Black Elite & White Liberals Fear,"Mr. Barrow has written a most extraordinary book on some of the most noble, yet sadly forgotten, defenders of the Confederacy - the Black Confederates. He offers a quite insightful look of their service throughout the War For Southern Independence. Some of the personal accounts of these brave men of colour are wonderful, leaving us to question the bigotry of those who use revisionist tactics in portraying the War For Southern Independence. I believe the unfortunate & temporarily successful block of the racist organisation NAACP against a proposed monument in the Commonwealth of Virginia, that was to have been erected to the memory of the thousands upon thousand of blacks who wore the grey & butternut & bore the Saint Andrew's Cross of the Southern Confederacy, is such an example."
4,Legends of the Mighty Sioux by Workers of the South Dakota Writers' Project,"A compilation of forty-five legends of the famous Sioux Indians of South DakotaAll of the legends pertain to traditional Sioux lore, to tales told around the campfire, and legends associated with places and hunting grounds.ISBN-13: 9780913062319"
3,Where are the cities?,"Too much Hollywood-style dramatization of events - especially battles, and not enough of the actual cities. Although 'When The Moors Ruled in Europe' is far better, the Jews were only mentioned once. In this documentary the contributions the Jews made to Islamic Spain were very much emphasized."
2,Not worth it!,"Don't waste your money on this book! I bought it thinking it would be a good resource book for teens, but it's horrible! The authors talk down to you as if we are the lowest scum on Earth. They have lists that just put you down like ""10 Ways to Tell if you are a Nerd"" and others that are just plain stupid (""The 17 Greatest Weird Al Songs of All Time""). I will admit that there are a FEW good articles on CDs and books, but they do not even begin to make up for the rest of the book."
5,The correct date for it is 1963!,They got the date wrong! Crest came out with this in 1963. Dial press was the 1962 hardcover 1st Edition of this book.
3,BOOM CHICKA WACKA WACKA!!,"The snug fit, dark indigo color and gold stitching make me feel like I'm wearing a cheesy pair of Jordache jeans from the 1970s. My wife won't let me wear them outside of the house. However, they are comfortable.Lee jeans tend to run small compared to other brands like Levi's. You might want to order them a size larger than normal."
5,a great novel,"i would like to thank reviewer mary whipple for pointing me in the direction of this fantastic book. it's a great old-fashion novel, full of complex and interesting characters, that paints a vivid picture of pre-world war I english society in a thoroughly entertaining story. isabel colegate's writing is dazzling to boot. upon finishing this book, i got on my computer and bought everything else that i could find by this author. if her other novels are even close to this good, that will have been money well spent."
2,offbeat but talky,"A Russian mix of EL TOPO, A BOY AND HIS DOG, HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE UNIVERSE, and monty python.The first half of the movie takes place in the desert of a faraway planet, a desert where nobody seems too bothered by the heat. The second half has some scenes below the planet, though it's all rusty old buildings.There's some funny stuff, and it is offbeat, though no great shakes, if you've seen a few sci-fi movies.Mostly interesting because it's a Russian sci-fi comedy."
5,Git It While You Can!,"I never got to see Beau Jocque live and I'm sad because I found his music a few weeks ago.I really like Jocque's style of zydeco and plan to buy more from him even though it would be tough to beat this good sounding live recording. It has a free form flow to it that I love and a tad over one hour of happy jamming music.If you like non traditional zydeco, you'll love this recording too."
2,When is less more?,"Why did they have to screw it up?The vinyl recording is far better. This CD issue, which adds five cuts, is so much less pleasant to listen to because of all the unnecessary and distracting ""chatter."" Three of the Getz-only numbers are among my favorites--""Grandfather's Waltz,"" ""Tonight I Shall Sleep with a Smile on my Face,"" and ""Here's That Rainy Day""--so I was particularly disappointed to find that, in order to listen to them on CD, I had to put up with all the non-music garbage.Too bad!"
5,The hidden messages in water is fasinating,"This book is exciting, facinateing and gives improtant new perspective to how important our everday words thoughts and actions really are. It makes sense of things in a whole new way."
1,Pseudoscience at its best,"I first became aware of Dr. Emoto's claims through the subway scene in the movie ""What the BLEEP do we know?"" I applied several tools from Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit to the claims. I searched the peer-reviewed scientific literature in the PubMed database at National Library of Medicine and, among the 12 million or so articles there, I found a single report by Dr. Emoto in what appeared to be a reputable journal. However, upon closer inspection, the article was described in this journal as a ""Photoessay"" and did not even come close to meeting the criteria for a true scientific study. If anyone can validate the results of Dr. Emoto's version of homeopathy, James Randi may have a million-dollar prize for you. If you want to be truly inspired by the awe and mystery and spirituality of nature, check out Ursula Goodenough's book."
1,"Let's get the facts straight, people....","The Earth's *surface area* is nearly 70% water, but its total mass is a paltry 0.023% H20. That's hardly significant. In the human body, water is distributed differently in various areas: lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water; bood contains about 83% water; body fat contains 25% water and bone has 22% water. Total % body water also varies considerably from infancy to adulthood, between men and women, and between individuals. These things can hardly be considered ""coincidence"" by any stretch of the imagination. The connection between water and life is well understood, straight-forward, and ,frankly, obvious. There's no need for magical thinking, weird mysticism, or silly books (like this one) to make the point that our water supply is precious and must be protected. Only an *irrational* person would argue against that."
1,*cough*,The things that people will believe in continue to amaze and utterly depress me. Learn just a bit of science people!
3,Does his theory hold water?,"I think the ideas outlined in the book are intriguing; that thought can change the organization of water. The experiments done in this book are not scientifically correct in method, and as a result it is highly likely that his ideas are not completely true. Without question more work needs to be done to determine whether his conclusions are valid. However, I still think there is a greater truth to what he is saying. Even if we can't affect water, our thoughts and intentions can certainly affect ourselves, other people, and other living things. Whether we can affect water or not, we can still heal ourselves and those around us though using a constructive attitude.I would not recommend buying this book unless the ideas are validated by further research. I would recommend other books instead that cultivate a positive attitude."
4,probably the best in its class,"For clinical practice, more insights on specific issues are available in other books."
1,Garbage,"I bought this for my daughter Christmas 2007 and wish i hadn't. There is no way to accurately line up slides but even if you do, the images are horrible. Not color, kinda greyscale images. I just got a call that after a month the thing has not been used to view anything yet. I will cut my losses and toss it given that I didnt keep the packaging after Christmas. Zero stars would be more appropriate."
5,VERY PLEASING TO THE SENSES!,"I have this on VHS along with the Costa Rica and Belize one, so glad to see them on DVD now!!! They are so well done and very informative. If you like to escape to exotic places in reality or even in your mind, the Ecotravel films are a must have. Really breathtaking vivid shots of the land and wildlife with amazing music which corresponds so well with the visuals, very pleasing to the senses. You will play them over and over and get lost in them. SOOOO thrilled to get them on DVD!!!"
4,Nicely fills in some gaps,I greatly enjoyed all of C.S. Forester's Hornblower novels. This particular volume adds an unfinished novel and two short stories to the Hornblower saga. As a stand alone read I wouldn't necessarily recommend it (ergo the four star review). But as additional material to fill out the Horatio Hornblower story I found this book to be equally enjoyable as the complete novels.
2,The novel is unfinished and hence not as good as others in t,C.S. Forester died before completing this novel. It is an excellent story of adventure and intrigue up to where it ends and so well worth the read. And of course it is important to read even this unfinished novel as a part of the series of stories of Hornblower's progress up through the navy ranks.
4,Prophetic and dated at the same time,"I first read this play in the late 1940's when I was in High School. The author died in 1938 at about the time Turing was ""inventing"" the Turing Machine. Perhaps the author intended this work as a parable about Bolshevism, but the steady growth of the computer makes it read today like a straight-forward prophecy which will come true in about 50 more years. The technology projected is all wrong in the details, of course, but it is fun to read today and draw the parallels and differences."
1,O'Neill Life Jacket,"This jacket is not great quality. Everytime we wear it, the cushion on the back rides up. It does not stay in place. I would not recommend this jacket for wear on the water for any water sports. We wakeboard & tube with it on , and we always have to stop & re-adjust the padding in the back. Not worth the money."
1,Uncomfortable around neck,The life jacket is cheap and looks nice but it's not very comfortable to wear. I have had multiple people try it on to see if it was just my body composition and they all said it was uncomfortable around the neck.
1,Made in China,"I bought this piece for my husband for Christmas and it did not come with the authentic certification, as it states. Also, it clearly shows it was made in China on the bottom of the piece, which was really disappointing and cheapened the gift. The hawk is cool looking, but only purchase this if you want something that was made in mass production."
4,Brings tears,"A few weeks ago I loaded some discs in the carousel, while I waited for my three brothers to arrive at my home, I chose two recordings with corea as a ""side man"",and the other one with him as the leader. While listening to the track spain from the priceless jazz collection on verve, I found my eyes welling up with admiration and sorrow, in that knowing the unfortunate reality that someone could be that talented, and for the most part, unknown in the world, outside of our community.As for the release,The mad hatter,all of the recordings from this period of the 1970's, were listened to often and loudly during my junior high and high school years, by my best friend and I , and they bring many fond memories.I RECOMMEND ALL THE CHICK COREA DATES FROM THE 1970'S SECRETDOMINO"
1,"OK Camera, Horrible Battery","The camera takes very good pictures, but the overall size makes it cumbersome to carry around. In the two years I've owned it, I brought it with me less than I would've for a smaller camera with worse optics. On hikes it is pretty much impossible to bring along because it's too big to fit in some day packs.And after only having this camera for two years and using it sparingly, it will not work now because the camera electronics will not fully charge the battery. Purchased replacement batteries, which are specific to this camera, but these will not fully charge either. For the price of the camera quality control should be significantly higher, buy a Canon, or something that will let you use standard sized (AA, etc.) batteries at least, instead."
1,Terrible book,"This is a bad book with many mistakes (not just spelling mistakes but design and interpretation mistakes!!). The author do not have seems to have hands-on experience in ESD and not known in ESD area, which is clear from his approach. Do not waste the money..If you are a designer, go and buy the book by Maloney and Dabral.If you are a device engineer, buy the book by Duvvury and Amerasekera."
5,If I could only curse...,"...I would have to go off on what a -BLEEP-ing great, GREAT, GREAT, movie this is! I was stunned the first time I saw it. -BLEEP-ing AMAZING!!! What's next, Mr. De Niro?"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"This was not a great movie like everyone thinks it is. I really didnt get into it. I thought the actors portrait of ""the mob"" was not right at all. Very Very off."
5,One of the best movies out there!,"I was about 11 years old when I first saw this movies. Because of this movies a can remember what I was wearing, doing before I started watching it, and what I ate while I watched it. The story is so amazing, acting was great, and best of all it brings back great memories of my childhood. If you haven't watched it, I recommend you do."
4,great!!,"I have never seen this movie, and a friend kept talking about it.....what a great story! And the cast is superb!"
5,Wow...,"I didn't see all of this movie, but the bits I did see were great. The acting is brilliant and I thought the score was really good, especially the credits at the end. Throughout the film I was sure either Sonny, C, Jane or C's father were going to die - it was that kind of film - but they made the inevitable death a necessary plot development rather than a cop-out ending. I thought it was v.v sad when Sonny died - but it wasn't soppy. Also with Sonny they protrayed him as a good and bad guy at the same time - that was v clever. The only thing is that at the end the last speech is a little preachy, but it's just about carried off. Great film - and it deosn't reveal in buckets of blood and gratuitous bad language. That sort of stuff is in proportion to the situation - overall, well done!"
1,Not Wide-Screen Version,Do not buy from Amazon marketplace vendor MOVIESONSALE1. They advertised Bronx Tale as wide screen but sent the movie in full screen version with misleading packaging. Now I know why their rating is only 89% satisfaction. They collect money and deposit it and accrue interest and wait for the buyer to complain. I waited over a month to watch this movie and I went ballistic. After contacting the seller they claim they will send me a prepaid envelope and a full refund.
2,Not bad but...,"I thought the script and most of the acting was pretty good. But that teenager(""C"") can not act at all. Where did they get this guy?He ruined the whole movie for me. Worth watching though..."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Robert De Niro fan. I love gangster genre movies. This film was really bad in my opinion. Extremely predictable to the point of nausea and the audience is force fed the rights and wrongs of life to the point where you want to throw this movie out the window. I also saw it when it first opened in theaters and I was really let down.There are a few good moments, all in all not the worst movie ever. There is no way this can be ranked with any of De Niro's really great movies though. If he was trying to use everything he learned from Scorscese he must not have learned too much.Again, this is my humble opinion. What do I know? But if you are thinking of buying this, make sure you rent it first. I wouldn't want this movie in my house."
5,A Brox Tale,"The movie was fine. Since a duplicate was received as a gift, VERY disappointed in the lack of response from seller, californiamedia09 for not responding to my refund request. Package never opened.Request ignored twice!"
4,"""A Bronx Tale,"" fantastic Robert DeNiro work.","""A Bronx Tale"" is Robert De Niro's directorial debut and a superb exposition of his autobiographical story of how he grew up in the Bronx in the 60s, written by Chaz Palmenteri, who also plays the chief antagonist. I'm not certain that I've got here the best copy of the film...but that doesn't take away from the story's grip on my senses; it is exciting, quick-paced, well-acted and skillfully edited to show a powerful story of the lethal reigns of neighborhood power. I recommend this movie to all intending to be correctly informed on how our world really works."
1,COPY,This is just a copy of the movie. It is not an original. The DVD was burned on a DVD-R. The labels are nice but the DVD does not contain any menu features at all.
1,A Bronx Tale,"This movie is great, one of my favorites, the DVD on the other hand was horrible, the quality was even worse, when I inserted the DVD it started the movie right away (no menu options).... the ad said ""NEW"" but when I received it, it was a copy, the image on the DVD wasn't even centered right, the cover was off color, I returned it for a refund.... VERY DISSAPOINTED....."
5,ON THE MEAN STREETS OF L.A.,"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for the inevitable `missing woman' (`dame' for the non-politically correct types) of an ex-convict who will not take no for an answer. And a `missing woman"" who wants to stay missing and will not take no for an answer. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned `dame' that caught me off guard. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. As always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."
4,"unexplained coincidences, but rich scenery","Raymond Chandler was the master of the hardboiled genre. The rich descriptions of the seedy side of pre-WWII LA is enough to make this book a winner. Our hero (Marlowe of course) gets drug into a bar and almost witnesses a murder, then gets hired by a rich playboy who drags him to another murder scene. He meets a spunky young lady, gets hired by a rich dame (to use the language of the genre), and runs into a pyschic and other strange characters. How does it all tie together? Does it even matter? Just enjoy the ride."
4,Knee deep in crime,"Ah Chandler. And Phillip Marlowe his private eye. This is the second time for this novel, but it's been so long it was like reading it for the first time. The characters, descriptions, and plot are vivid and complex. Marlowe witnesses the murder of a bar owner in the black side of town (1940s LA) by a big lug ex-con, Moose Malloy. Malloy is in search of his lost love, Velma who used to sing here when it was a white bar. This simple set-up embroils Marlowe knee deep in connected crimes. Well done, by a master."
4,Good prep for Core (hardware) portion of A+ exam,"This book by Meyers is great for someone who wants a comprehensive guide to computer hardware and how computers work.I passed both A+ exams (Core and Dos/Windows) by a fairly large margin, but saw a lot of questions about material unfamiliar to me in the Core test (when I thought I was well prepared for the Core test by having read most of this book).I believe, having read most of the hardware parts of this text, I was able to guess the correct answers to some of the unusual questions (questions unlike any I had seen in preparation) concerning hardware.For the Windows portion of the A+ exam, I highly recommend Jones's (et. al.) A+ Exam Cram."
4,Misleading info on exam questions,"While the book is exceptionally well presented, I found that the accompanying CD with sample test questions to be a disappointment. The CD contains several tests for both the Core and DOS/Windows but only 4 of them are available with the purchase of the book. The additional tests require a $79 fee before activation. That information is NOT disclosed until you use the CD."
1,Old News,The subject matter is ancient. You will not pass the new Comptia adaptive exams with the nformation in this book.
4,Tarot of the Old Path:A good Tarot for witchs of the old way,"Im a new witch, The Tarot of the Old Path is my first deck and it has been very nice to learn....not the best for a first timer in tarot. I like it but because it had a large female side to it and that was what I was looking for being new to the Craft."
1,Rusted!,"We used this several times over the course of four weeks- and then I noticed that the inside had rusted!! We always wash it right away and let it air dry- which I don't think is expecting too much- but apparently we should have been patting it down!? I've never had a cheese grated rust on me before, so this was a big disappointment. Buying a new one right now- total waste of money."
3,Enjoy Life,"""Don't look back on happiness, or dream of it in the future. You are only sure of today; do not let yourself be cheated out of it."" ~Henry Ward BeecherThis is the book that all 10 year old boys dare each other to read. This is the first time I have read this book, I will blame it on laziness rather than lack of courage...It's the classic tale of good versus evil. A dark carnival comes to town led by Mr. Dark, The Illustrated Man. This is no ordinary carnival. Mr. Dark is out to recruit people to a life of misery in his sideshow traveling tour. Two boys discover his secret and will be forced to decide if they are ""autumn people"" or ""summer people"". They will discover that sometimes you don't want your wishes to come true.The book reminds you to enjoy your life regardless of your age or circumstances and that it's important to laugh every once in a while."
5,Haunting!,Something wicked this way comes is one of the most haunting books i've ever read. Mr Bradbury's way of story-telling really makes you search your inner soul and inspect it carefully. Its horror lies in the carnival and how its owners spread their evil. It's a must-read for anyone who love deep (poetic?) horror.
1,Stinks,"Though I usually enjoy books of this mysterious nature, this one was different. I do not reccommend this book for people like me with very little patience and a short attention span, for even in it's most exiting parts, it proves to be boring and slow-moving."
3,something wicked this way comes,"""Something wicked this way comes"" is a horror novel.This story is about a carnival that alway came at oct. and turn every people ride the merry-go-round into part their show. The merry-go-round can also make people young and older, that's why many people want to ride it backward to make themselve younger. Mr. Dark the manjor of the carnival want to make Jim to be part of carnival. Thanks to Will his best friends and Will's father, together they save JIm. And ending the story in a unbelieve way."
3,A bit disappointed for a Bradbury novel...,"I hate to say it...but Bradbury's writing style on this book was not for me. There were passages I skipped and I felt that the ending was way too rushed. I would have loved to learn more about the Illustrated Man and his crew - how did they get their powers? Where did they come from? The best part of novel was the library scene...otherwise, it was just OK for me."
2,Not up to expectations,"Many high schools cover this book in english classes, and though I hadn't read it in school, I've always been fond of Bradbury's short stories, so I figured I'd give it a read. I was fairly disappointed. It doesn't match his short fiction. I found the plot and characters dry and predictable. Maybe I just don't like carnies..."
3,Good product,It is a good product but for me a little complicated I never study music and this book is for student of music. I would like to have a more basic one. This book is a good book for people that have knowledge in guitar not for new ones.
1,Stop! don't waste your money,"I've read hundreds of business books, this ranks as one of the lousiest waste of time and money. My wife bought it on the recommendation of her friend...I got a hold of it and read it. The writing skill is that of a 6th grader, the content is so general, repetitive and lacking in any sustance that I can't believe all the positive reviews it's gotten. Let me summarize this book for you and save you time and $10....Globalize...that's it. One word. If you don't know that by now, you really shouldn't be in business. This book is a complete waste of time."
5,Cashflow is king,"Finally, a book that teaches you how to build a cashflow business. This is the only book that I've found shows you how to generate cashflow (without being in real estate), including the calculations. This book teaches you how to do it like the big companies does. Great reading."
4,MP3 Boombox,"Performs well, as advertised. Have not had the opportunity to run on batteries yet, so no comment. It has one very annoying feature - I like to listen to old radio serials while going to sleep, but the LED is so bright, it lights up the entire bedroom. If they could employ a light sensor, like so many clock radios use, it would be a perfect device."
2,Olsen,This book requires concentration. It is not an easy or satisfying read. The TV series had an attempt at interpreting it but even that did not really work. I now know why late in my life I had never bothered with it before.
5,My favorite historical fiction thus far for kids!,"I absolutely LOVED this book as I read it with my 7 and 9 year old children. The language is so descriptive and eloquent, the plot so engaging- we struggled to put it down! I love the lesson taught as this proud young viking learns where that pride will leave him, and of a God who truly is his help in a time of trouble through the witness of his Irish slave.There is some violence- just to be warned- as it is dealing with the topic of the vikings and they were a brutal people. We love enjoying history with ""living books"" and Beorn is at the top of my list! We also enjoyed creating our own viking ship with a card board box and colored it during the read-aloud sessions."
1,confusing order of compounds,"What on earth is the system for ordering compounds?? Take the first character in the dictionary - ichi (one). It has four pages of compounds under the on reading, listed helter skelter. In Nelson, the compounds are listed in ascending stroke order of the second character in the compound. There is apparently no system at all in Kodansha and you are left to pore laboriously through four pages of compounds, one by one. Makes no sense."
1,No thank you,"I bought this book after being diagnosed with endometriosis. In my case, the diagnosis had been completely unexpected and I was looking for some answers in regards to how this disease would effect my life.Although there was some useful information in this book (particularly in the first few chapters), in general this book left me feeling as though my whole world was about to end. I have since found out that many women live ordinary lives with only minimal disruption caused by this disease. Reading this book, however, I was given the distinct impression that I would eventually end up in so much pain I would not be able to leave my home and that I had no chance of ever having children.This book did me absolutely no favours, and I would not recommend it."
3,I climbed to the mountain top.,I enjoyed this book. I had not finished reading it when somebody nicked it. I am still trying to figure out who.Emeka .
3,NOT HALF BAD,"Then again, not half good, either. Depends on how you look at it. I'm no fan of teen pop, by any means. I do however like the remixes of a few of these songs, especially the Paul Oakenfold mix of Rock Your Body and the trance-ish mix of Cry Me A River.And Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful"" is better than I ever thought it would be. I picked this up on a whim at Target, paid next to nothing for it, and still listen to it pretty regularly. If you want one bad enough, you'll have to get it used. :0)"
1,Why bother,pretentious twaddle...the music isnt up to much either in terms of songs or melody and the lyrics....oh please! cod romanticism and ethereal nonsense. Someones been reading too much soppy female literature.
1,Cheap replacement but not really a replacement,"I bought these to replace my 2-way fuel valves in my 1966-1977 Early Ford Bronco.First, these valves are cheap Chinese versions of an old American design that you can still buy through Parker Hanfin. I only learned this after I bought them.Second - these valves DO NOT replace the old style American valves because the common port should come out the bottom - not on the side as these are.Third - On the old American version the handle turns 180 deg to switch tank feeds. These DO NOT - they only turn 90 deg.Fourth - the Chinese design took some short cuts and the parts ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE so that means what I bought is useless to me.NOT RECOMMENDED if you want a quality replacement for an old American Design that you can still buy from an American manufacturer."
2,Great--until it died,"I purchased this item with a hi-res camera, and it was a lifesaver on long shoots. The ability to back up my images immediately gave me real peace of mind, and the thing really worked as advertised. Although it would freeze every now and then, I never lost any images--the only drawback was that you had to remove the battery to restart it, as it stopped responding to all button inputs.This morining, as I was preparing for a 5-day shoot, I turned it on to delete any old images and recharge it, and the screen was completely dead. Plugged into my PC via USB, it all still shows up, but I was totally depending on it for this upcoming weekend, and I have been totally let down. I have no choice but to try to navigate it in the dark, unless they want to overnight one to my hotel."
4,Coolwalker review,"The Nikon Coolwalker is the only way I have found to view Nikon's NEF raw files in a portable device. The Coolwalker works very well as a viewing device and storage device with one notable exception....it can deplete it's charged battery very quickly. If you buy a Coolwalker, you should consider spending the money in a spare battery right off. Downloading a couple of cards will take awhile and you will need the second battery to get through the day. Hopefully, any update to the Coolwalker will include a more readily available battery, less power consumption and a larger screen. I am happy with the Coolwalker but I could be happier."
4,Stories from the road.,"This isn't really a biography, but more of a collection of stories from Sonny Barger. A lot of them are very funny, and some of them are tales from the road that would make anyone want to hop on a motorcycle. The problem with this book is the introduction when Sonny Barger tells you that some of the stories may be true, and some of them may not be true. He leaves it up to you as you read, but either way the stories are fun to read, and some of them will have you laughing for quite awhile. He even goes outside of the Hell's Angels into other clubs he's aware of and other people he knows sharing stores from them, one of them was on the Dragons leader who was about to buy a Honda until his club members knocked on his door and asked him if it was true."
5,Thumbs up!,"C-balance is an excellent product from a trusted hobbyist turned vendor Julian Sprung, this is also the best price available anywhere."
1,Kroenke Database Processing uses a 286 chip,"I have a difficult time learning from this book. The questions he uses are very difficult to understand and often are misleading.The answer key is missing, so understanding or checking your grasp of the material must wait until officially tested. Which is now too late, the concepts roll into each other. His vocabulary, used to describe a condition, is incredibly vast. So unnecessary. Too many definitions, not enough examples where to use the concepts.Bashes MS and Access to excess. Nothing in the instructions how to find SQL or install it or use it, so you are forced to us Access which when you query, is broken by some of his sample SQL statements.Finally, many examples and conditions are explained along with his terminology which he says no one uses!! But you find this out only AFTER you have read the pages involved. Seems like a waste to explain a concept you should never use or doesn't hold true. And then he tests you on those concepts."
5,A good story from beginning to end!,"I loved everything about this book, the story, the excellent writing, it kept me glued to the screen. I loved it."
2,Why isn't this labeled as a short story?,"It is really annoying to start reading a book only to find out that it is a short story. This could have been an interesting book, but it only took about half an hour to read. I don't understand why it is not mandatory to label short stories so that people know what they are buying."
1,Meandering and Confusing,I am not sure where the adulation for this book comes from and I realize I am in the minority in not liking it. I found this book very difficult to follow and the ceaseless jumping about from time to time was annoying. There was also a surprising amount of repetition in this short book. I really wanted to like this book. It might be better with a second read but life is too short for that.
4,Great movie - not for everyone.,"Ms. March was entrancing and the photography was superb. It's R rated with reason, and a fairly hard R in my opinion but there is really no way around that if you're true to the book which is probably historically accurate. I would recommend the book as well."
5,Ms. Duras,"This book, written in a sparse style, is a recollection of Ms. Duras, her affair, her family, her environs in French Indochina during the late '20's and early '30's. Although it does bounce ""back and forth,"" her style challenges you to ""keep up."" She is a thinker, this young girl. I encourage you to give this a read (get it at a good price) and see for yourself. It seems that the best stories are our own...Ms. Duras had quite a story to tell! Five stars!P.S., If you haven't seen the movie, get a copy! The cinematography is the best I've seen in a foreign file - first rate!"
3,Forbidden Love,Wonderful display of forbidden love found and lost. This true fiction love story really got my juices flowing. I saw the movie before reading the book. But I wasn't disappointed at all by the literary version of the story.
5,Encyclopedia of Counseling: Master Review and Tutorial for the National Counselor Examination and State Exams,This book is great! All of the questions that are outlined in this book were extremely beneficial when studying for the exam. I believe it is a must have before sitting for the test.
1,incomplete,I did not recieve the box with checks as stated in the ad. Only receiced the program disc.
3,it's just okay,I hoped it would help with sleep. It's calming but not nearly enough for me. The taste isn't bad though.
5,Review from Journal of the Institue of Health Education,"""A mine of information for the academic who starts to teach (and a hidden blessing for those who are taught). Very strongly recommended for its clarity and presentation."""
3,Good not great Sci-Fi.,"Pros:Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are excellent actors, doing a good job in their roles.Spacey is completely believable as an alien even though he may not be.The story's setting in a mental institution, with its interesting characters gave interesting support to the movie, especially Celia Weston's character. (so under-rated as an actress)Cons:Could have developed Spacey's character a bit more to show his possible alien-ness.Not enough Celia Weston.Overall, a good not great sci-fi movie, though worthy of being on my sci-fi movie shelf."
4,Makes You Feel Warm Inside,"As a mental health professional, it was hard to get past the annoying and inaccurate portrayals of the mental health system. However the movie was engaging enough to allow me to suspend reality and see beyond that enough to enjoy it for what it was. And thank goodness because it's dynamite. Spacey (Prot) is fantastic as a man who is detained in a psychiatric hospital because he appears delusional. The plot focuses around the psychiatrist's journey in helping Prot overcome his delusions. It's a very human story that may leave you feeling a bit more compassionate and open hearted. What's more is that it manages to do this with no sex or violence."
4,Escape is only a planet away,"This was a very moving film. Both Bridges and Spacey brought an excellence in performance to what is, on the surface, a straightforward psychological investigation (albeit Bridges does wonderfully the psychiatrist who almost wishes to believe in his patient's alien-ness) but underneath is a study of the alienation of the mentally ill amongst us."
5,IS HE OR IS HE NOT?,"I am a big Kevin Spacey fan. I think he is one of the best actors ever. He continues to deliver in K-PAX. It's a story about a man who says he is from the planet K-PAX. He gets placed into a psyche hospital. There he meets his doctor played by Jeff Bridges and the two form an unusual bond. While in the hospital, Prott (Kevin Spacey) embraces the other mental patients in his ward. He offers unjaded guidance and counsel. At the end of the movie, two of the patients are released because of Prott's, not the doctor's, help.K-PAX is a story about unbearable sadness and thin degrees of hope. Yet it's not depressing. This is a movie that doesn't really answer your questions at the end. But I was okay with that. I enjoy movies with unusual story-lines and this movie delivers. It satisfies on many levels. I would classify this movie as a mystery drama with a sci-fi element.I can say without reservation, do not hesitate to add this dvd to your movie collection."
4,"Great quality work pants, great price","I've worn Dickies pants for years and honestly I cannot find a better quality of work pants. The price is great, too, since I also don't have to have any alterations done to them...an additional savings bonus."
4,Solid pants,"Price could be a bit better. Dickies quality, so good or bad depending on your opinion of Dickies. Color doesn't fade."
4,Pants,These are the only pants my husband is allowed to wear at work. They are made well; durable material that doesn't fade with regular wear and washing.
4,Great for school uniforms,I bought these pants for my son's high school uniform pants. It's a good shade of gray and they always look crisp and sharp with no ironing. Love that. Sturdy fabric means he can play video games on the floor without wearing through the knees or butt. Just wish the fabric was a bit softer and I don't like having to carefully clip off the little Dickies patch - always afraid I'm going to tear the fabric. But a great choice for school uniform pants.
2,sized a little small,"I generally wear a 38x30, and that's what I bought in these, they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste. I'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in, but you may want to get a waste size up. I'll be wearing them in a dress office setting, and I'm surprised how good these look, hopefully they last a long time too."
3,ok overall,"The pants seem to be of pretty good quality and fit well. My main complaint is that the pockets are too small which makes them feel constricting when carrying a wallet, cell phone etc."
4,Workpants,"This order is just right in size and color.They are a light weight,easy to care for.They look good on my man also."
4,Thoroughly researched and well written,"Anne Somerset's version of Elizabeth I is thoroughly researched and presented in exacting detail, but despite the minutiae, it is still an interesting read. Somerset expends some space on the details of everyday Tudor life, but this book is primarily an historical work, describing court intrigues, treasonous conspiracies and international incidents in presenting a complete overview of the most important political events of the era. Readers wanting a simple understanding of Elizabethan politics could probably find an easier volume to read, but Somerset's style is quite interesting, and serious students of history will enjoy this work immensely."
3,Wanted More,"The book is good, but not great. The author presents a good overview of Elizabeth while sometimes going into excruciating detail. There in lies the problem. Much of what I wanted to know more about: court intrigue and the supporting characters were often given short shrift. At the sametime, the author works very hard to maintain the ""virgin queen"" myth, often off handedly dismissing evidence for Elizabeth's affairs. The book also ends abruptly, telling us little about Queen Bess' last years.On the plus side, the author does an excellent job explaining the queens religous views. Still, there are better biographies of this facinating subject to be read."
5,In depth and very interesting,A great trip through history. I hated to see this wonderful bio end. At times the details were a little more info than I needed but always fascinating. Highly recommended.
5,A perfect installment for a pink panther fan,This is a real good movie despite the fact Peter Sellers isn't in it. Alan Arkin does an excellent job of portraying the character of Inspector Clouseau. Alan Arkin uses the same accent and physical humor as Peter Sellers did.The movie is filled with hilarios scenes and of course begins with a humorous cartoon short.If you are a Pink Panther fan I suggest for you to buy a copy today.
2,For Continuity Freaks Only,"Hey, I like have a complete set of films in my collection for each franchise. So, this is part of the Pink Panther legacy and although Arkin tries, he's no Peter Sellers and the plot is so weak that it collapses at the end and the movie finishes so fast you'll think that that ran out of time."
2,Dissapointed Nancy Wilson Fan,"Please be clear that I love Nancy Wilson. I only started collecting her music last year after seeing clips on Youtube. I think that she had one of the greatest voices in Jazz/Pop history. However I was dissapointed with "" Nancy Wilson Live from Las Vegas"". She is not in good voice on this disc. It sounds like she is suffering from ""Vegas Throat"". Her voice sounds husky, rough and tired. Her signature belting, breath control, flexibility, lovely soft notes, and vibrato are not present. In addition the song choices are not inspired, although I did enjoy her version of ""Black is Beautiful"". If you want to hear Nancy Wilson live at her best, purchase ""The Nancy Wilson Show"" CD and/or the ""Nancy Wilson at Carnegie Hall"" DVD."
3,End of the Road,"Yeah Baby! Austin Powers really did exist, if one can believe this Presley curiosity. I mean, groovy chicks, kitschy psychedelia and one smooth lead combine to assault the senses, a la our Mr. Powers. All right, so Elvis doesn't talk scouse, but he does have a cool way with the women, one of whom happens to be his (on-screen) adversary, and who's pretty stylish herself (Nancy S).So that no-one goes away without a (wry) smile on their face Elvis even gets to NOT win the climactic race! Wow! Now that was radical, but even better would follow as Elvis adopted a different (read: less wooden) screen persona and experimented with more contemporary situations (bedroom scenes, branding and glimpsed nudity).However, by that stage no-one really cared anymore, and this slightly whimsical piece was swiftly consigned to late night TV.Best song: ""Your Groovy Self: Singer: Nancy Sinatra (solo). At least E still got the girl!"
5,i got my whiter teeth! ;),"I was kinda hesitant in purchasing a teeth whitening product at frist, but there was a coupon in the newspaper for a good couple dollars off and thought I should try it. This thing works! Whiter teeth in a couple of days!! The only bad part is that if you have sensitive teeth, the product will make your teeth feel really sensitive when using it. I love how does not take up a long time sitting with the stripe in your mouth."
2,Hurts my teeth,These were way too strong for my teeth. I used them as directed and towards the end less than directed. They gave me long term pain in my teeth(about a years worth).
4,They work,"I 'm on day 3 of 7 days and I can already tell a difference! It is a little inconvenient because you can't talk, eat or drink with the strips in. The strips need to be on twice a day for 30 minutes each time. I put them on during my commute to work, and then again while I'm watching the nightly news. The first couple of times putting them on was a little tricky and uncomfortable, but then you get used to it. When you take them off there is this slimy gel that remains or your teeth. I just wipe it off and it still seems to work. I am experiencing some gum sensitivity, a slight stinging sensation, but nothing unbearable."
4,good product,"I kept hearing stories of people's teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips. Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material (peroxide) on the gums. Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on. With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.If you're wondering what it feels like to use these, it's very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist. Something in your mouth, which shouldn't be there, but you'll be able to work around it with a little practice. Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first."
5,Good Product,"Just after couple of days of use I got whiter smile. This product really works, no bs. you should check this product out."
3,3 stars due to Procter&Gamble packaging,"First, I have no complaints on the performance of the Crest Whitestrips. This product works wonders and, as advertised, is safe on the tooth enamel when used as directed. My dissatisfaction with this product is the packaging chosen on the ""Premium"" product. In the past I was a Crest Whitestrips Classic customer until I decided to try the Premium version. The Classic product came in simple cardstock packaging with cellophane wrap as the protective tamperproof seal. The Premium product is in a sturdy #5 plastic box which, unless you have a recycling center that accepts this type of plastic, will go into your local landfill. This packaging is absolutely a waste and surely drives up the price of the product. Please recycle."
3,"Crest, can you waste a little more plastic?","Does the product work? Yes - that can be seen in any review here. I would like to bring up the topic of packaging - I will be brief. Is this huge, plastic box really necessary to carry 28 one millimeter thick strips? In a time when conservation is a buzz word and petroleum products should be kept to a minimum for a variety of reasons, Crest decides to package a tiny product in a small boat. Seriously, this is a huge waste. Not to mention, the cost would most definitely drop if a more practical box were implemented for future customers. In short, I would like to see a more environmentally and financially responsible company helping me achieve my shallow need for whiter teeth."
1,dont waste your time or money,"these strips don't whiten your teeth AT ALL, even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile. You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen't cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!"
4,My teeth are definitely whiter!,"Well these strips work great. I'm always skeptical about products like this because I've rarely known a quick-fix product to work for me, and I think alot of the time the results are all in the consumer's head. I also never have the patience to go through the entire duration instructed on the box. However, I've been using this product for two days now, and I already notice a difference, and my friends do too. I can only imagine how white my teeth will be at the end of the week. The fact that it only takes a week is worth it to me, too.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because it is making my teeth ridiculously sensitive! I've had my mouth closed for an hour now and the pain still hasn't subsided. I might just be a big baby, but it's a very intense tingling, that of which I'm not sure I can handle for the entire week. However, all in all I do recommend this product and I doubt your experience will be as painful as mine."
3,"Seems to work OK, but the bottom strip is very annoying.....","These seem to work ok, but the bottom strip can come off easily since saliva accumulates over the 30 minutes period you have to keep these in. I hated swallowing while keeping these in, because the taste is really bad -- so I started folding up a napkin and putting it under my tongue when I began the 30 minute period. This helped keep the saliva off of the bottom strip, so it stayed on better. 30 minutes is a really long time to keep something disgusting and slippery on your teeth though -- I wonder if there is a way they could make a product that would only take 10 or 15 minutes?"
5,Wonderful,This is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it every Christmas for years and will continue to do so until I can no longer read. I've also watched a number of the different versions of the movie based on the book. The movies were great but for me nothing beats the written word!
1,"Our hero, Ebenezer Scrooge","I agree with what Micheal Levin writes at a website called The Daily Objectivist, Scrooge was better at the beginning! He says: ""You know the ritual: boo the curmudgeon initially encountered in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, then cheer the sweetie pie he becomes in the end. It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love. But there was no need to make the object of his lesson an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. Must such a man expect no fairer a fate than to die scorned and alone? Bah, I say. Humbug."" How could it be that an obscure website like The Daily Objectivist would have the most intelligent review of this book that I've ever seen?"
1,The worst book ever!,I know this is a classic amd you are supposed to admire the great writimg skills of Charles Dickens but this book is tortureous. He uses unnecessary comparrisons and words that nobody understands. I understand Dickens is a great writer and it show. Everybody knows this story you do not need to torture yourself ny reading this though. It is boring and hard to understand . Just watch one of the movies.
1,"The stupidest, most confusing book in the world","I had to read this for Language Arts last year and I absolutely hated it. No matter how many times I reread the Staves, I still couldn't understand it. It is just a bunch of details, not a tied-together broad image. If you like to get confused and are in High School or older, be my guest and read this monstrosity."
4,A Christmas Carol,"I have an older Kindle and the illustrations were a little hard to see, but the book itself was excellent."
2,I know it's a classic but...,"I am a Dickens fan but 'A Christmas Carol' isn't my cup of tea...it's dark and sermonising, not what I really want at Christmas time :)"
3,A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens,"I used this book as an ancillary text for my CAHSEE (California High School Exit Exam) class. Even though it presented some difficulties, comprehension and vocabulary issues, the students felt very proud that they could read this classic and know the story along with so many others. Most of the class had never heard of The Christmas Carol, so I was excited to share it with them. I used study materials along with the novelette, and then showed the Jim Carrey version to help them visualize the events, etc.. It is a classic for a reason, and I never fail to get new insight to the tale as well as the Dicken's characters.The only suggestion I would make would be to add illustrations. That's the only reason for the ""okay"" rating."
3,Beware - Black and White illustrations!,"Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book. This detracts a great deal from their charm, especially considering the quality of the reproduction, which is fuzzy and muddy. Otherwise the book seems to be well made. Dover has a paperback version which keeps the coloring. I wish that the publisher had popped for the color and charged more."
5,A Must Read,"I hadn't read this since the '70s, and I'm sorry I had forgotten so many details. This is a book that should be read at leat every five years!"
2,Bad audio experience with Kindle on iPad,I ordered this thinking I could listen to the story on the Kindle iPad. There is audio but there is no progress bar. Thus you must start at the beginning and listen to the full story. There is no way to jump to anywhere in the audio. L-ame. The kids and I got bored with the introduction of the author and I went back to reading it outloud.
5,Christmas Carol,"Christmas Carol, is a classic and worth reading again and be reminded of the beauty of conversion and new life to be lived with joy and generosity."
5,Beautiful Unabridged Edition,"When I was a child my father would read A Christmas Carol to me during the week before Christmas. I had been trying to find an unabridged, beautifully illustrated edition to read to my granddaughter. I finally found it in this magnificent rendition of the great Dickens tale. This is a book that is sturdy enough to pass to multiple generations with pride and share the real spirit of Christmas. It also makes one appreciate the elegance of Victorian grammar. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,Still a good read after all these years,"I have watched various adaptations of this Dickens classic and wanted to read the story as an attempt to gauge which movies were the closest to the original text. As it turns out, the 1951 version with Alistair Sim is truest to the original, although some omissions were made there as well to adapt it to the screen... as you would expect with a book adaptation. Still, the original story is a joy to read and the 1840's vernacular is quite entertaining, if thought-provolking at times. A good read."
3,Good classic,A Christmas Carol was an enjoyable short read. It was nice to read descriptions that all the movies miss. I will read it more than once.
4,Awesome,Awesome I love this book so much Dickens is truly a genius. Have read this many times before and this was the best one!
5,"Jonathan Winters' ""A Christmas Carol"" is a triumph!","Jonathan Winters is a tremendously talented comedian, but he also makes an excellent well-rounded actor as this recordings demonstrates. His Scrooge is mean, troubled and seemingly irredeemable but as Mr. Winters makes his way through the story he shows us a quite complex and interesting portrait of the infamous miser. Just so you know there is a female actress to do the female parts and there is music and sound effects throughout the story to make it well paced and impossible to take your ears off of it. Although I don't want to give too much away Mr. Winters gives a Ghost Of Christmas Present with a Scottish accent! This is a wonderful way to help celebrate Christmas!I never thought I'd find something to rival Patrick Stewart's one man show, but this is a thoroughly entertaining production especially considering the ""reader"" is American!"
2,Not the best,"Not the best imprint out there. No illustrations. Doesn't have the right ""feel"" (e.g., not calling the ""Staves"" ""Staves'!)."
1,Terrible eBook edition,"Just pay a couple of bucks for one that is decently formatted and has what the description states. NO Table of Contents, NO illustrations, NO navigation."
5,Wonderful story!,I enjoyed reading the original story after watching several movies based on A Christmas Carol. it's interesting to see what was left in or was changed. I probably will read it again next Christmas!
4,Dickens classical story is wondefully illustrated by Innocenti,"There's not much to say about Dickens' classic that has not already been said. But what one can say is that the illustrations from Roberto Innocenti are wonderful, with an astonishing attention to detail and a keen sense of period (one of the illustrations, the one set at a corner of a busy and snowy market street, has almost 100 characters in it, and a richly detailed portrayal of common life)."
5,A Christmas Carol,"I recieved the book A Christmas Carol right on time. Wow ! It is wonderful. I love the pictures, front cover and everything about the book. I would highly recomend it. Thanks"
5,A Must Read,What a wonderful story. So beautifully written and so evocative of all that we need in this life. Treat yourself and read this book!
3,Old story but still interesting. Have only seen the movie version in the past,writing style was somewhat different back in those days but still easy to understand. Also interesting to see the difference between the original book and the movie version
5,Book,Who does love this story. Reading it to granddaughter. It never get old. Tradition to see or read evey year.
4,Good lesson for kids,"The story a Christmas Carol is a very detailed novel. In this story a very grumpy, old, snotty rich man named Ebenezer Scrooge is a grouch when it comes to Christmas. Ebenezer is haunted by three very difference spirits - the ghost of Christmas past, Christmas present and Christmast future.Charles Dickens is a very talented author. His novel, A Christmas Carol, is a big inspiration to kids. It teaches kids to not be greedy now and when they grow up. As a 6th grader, I would say this is a very good book to read for kids and adults."
2,"Nice, but no images","The formatting is well done and it's nice to have a TOC that links, but the file seems to be missing its images."
3,Christmas carol,I choose this rating because it was a pretty boring book but it was finda interesting itself. I was avoid book in total.
3,A Christmas Carol,I have not had time to read this book yet. I will be glad to review it when I have read it.
4,Great,This book was great to see and read. This book is good for young and older kids to adults. My whole family enjoyed this.
5,Great Classic,Loved reading the original story after years of watching the various Hollywood interpretations. Good read for sitting around the Christmas Tree.
3,"The ""L"" Word, Season4","The series has gradually been deteriorating. Season 1 was crisp and edgy but, as is so often the case with series,it seemed to get caught up in itself and loose direction. Some attempts to get back on track in this season but 2 and 3 were just silly. Hope 5 will bring back the sparkle of 1."
4,an addicted fan,"I have watched this season within the space of a week. Though only having received it a week before that. I'm finding it hard to write this without spoilling the plot or the characters. I suppose the only way to sum it up is ""if you like the L word and it characters"" buy it. Imo you will like it.I wish we had (I think it it is)hbo I could see the premier of season 5 in january (this may be incorrect)."
4,Outstanding music from a wonderful voice!!,Zucchero is a gift kept secret from the American public. I was introduced to this music while traveling in Europe and was seduced by the power and softness of Zucchero. This CD is a terrific mix of his best music and is perfect for the Zucchero novis as well as long-time fans. Buy it...you'll love it.
1,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,"IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSE ANOTHER PERSON'S OPINION BUT I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE. I READ ABOUT 100 PAGES AND TOSSED IT. THE WRITING IS VERY STILTED AND ITS JUST NOT A COMFORTABLE READ. HEROINE AGGIE IS SO FULL OF START THAT SHE'S JUST NO LIKEABLE, EVEN IN THE LOVE SCENES....."
2,Super Cute but not Worth the Price,"Very, very cute toy box, but it's an overpriced example of a cheap made-in-China product. Pre-drilled screw holes were off and the chemical and paint smell out of the box made it obvious that it wasn't the healthiest product for a really young child."
5,A classic Ella,It's a very good album containing most of the best songs Ella Fitzgerald ever sangs. Perfect for easy listeners seeker.Highly reccomended !
1,Step into readers' shoes.,"The best recommendation to the writers of textbooks is ""Step into reader's shoes."" Writer is an expert of the subject. He knows the subject very well. Readers are not. Readers need enough guide to follow what is written in the book. This book often jumps into a conclusion without enough intermediate steps. Equations come out of blue. I was perplexed by that the writing is sparse and crude. Thus I stopped reading this book and returned."
4,Fair Deal..!!,"Nice Shoes and Good price.. Feels very light..Fits comfortable..I gave it 4 stars, as the small black (leather like) piece in the front, brings down the overall appearance..!!"
3,Content,"Highlighting on EVERY PAGE, with some writing in margins, I was surprised by the amount of writing, which I was not expecting. However, cover looks new. Cannot remember promptness of delivery."
3,Use for CLEP Self-Study,"I purchased this text for self-study for the Macroeconomics CLEP. While incredibly well written for the material it presents, it did not cover all of the topical areas I encountered on the CLEP, nor did it go into sufficient depth for several areas that were."
3,Scared to death of Russia now?,"Man, had I not been to Russia as many times already that I have...and I was getting read to leave and had read this book, I would be too scared to go!! Mr. Brzezinski's book is entertaining at best. It glances over some important parts in today's Russia. However, it is too damn moralistic and bemoans the same whining, bitching and complaining that 98% of all the expats living in Moscow complain about...it's not like home. Well, duh...If you have been following news out of Russia, this book will add nothing new to your bank of knowledge. If you have never been to Russia and you are getting ready to go to Russia, don't let this book scare you away."
2,Bar Tales in Book Form,"Brzezinski displays the acumen of a tourist. The abundance of factual mistakes in Casino Moscow damage the author's credibility when he makes a rare reference to Russian businesses, which were the supposed topic of the book. As a collection of anecdotal stories, this book was more entertaining than what you'd hear from an average guy in a bar. But as a source of information about Russia in the 1990's, it is not WSJ quality."
4,How to make money off a dying nation 101,"A excellent first hand account of the life of a priviledged ""westener"" in modern day Russia. I also spent some time in Moscow and St Pete and everything he talks about rings true. At times the author walks a fine line....he can not seem to decide whether he has contempt or jeaulously for Russia's new mafia kings. He rides on their private lear jets, attends their feasts, but then derides them. His side stories about Poland, Belarus and Urkaine are as good as his Moscow stories. I give him credit for getting out of Moscow and writing on the ""real Russia"". He final chapter is dead on...Russia is not America's fault or the IMF's fault...Russia is Russia's fault."
3,Good,"Overall very good, I just expected a more intriguing end. But drawn great and well written. Recommended for those new to comics or fans of Meltzer"
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"This book came highly recommended and...I don't understand why. Maybe because people like really lame crap? Well, this was that. Really lame story. Really dumb ending.The story is a ripoff of the Watchmen. It's Watchmen-Lite featuring Superman. If anyone were to say it wasn't, well they're deluding themselves. The Dr. Light rape scene was just really juvenile and stupid. I get it. Watchmen had a rape. Therefore if you're ripping off Watchmen you need some guy in a stupid white hat to rape somebody. Make's so much sense!Meltzer is good at writing narration. He makes the characters almost believable. If only this story wasn't so awful.And the huge anime eyes were just too much.Overrated crap. Hype to sell comics. Garbage. There, I said it. It's not one-star bad, but it's definitely two-star bad.And puh-lease, spare me Joss Whedon telling me how great this is. One complete hack congratulating another complete hack. BOOOOOO."
4,Mixed Feelings,"That this story is well written cannot be denied. What the author chooses to write about, however, is disturbing to any loyal DC comics fan. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back and enjoy any Ralph/Sue Dibny story the way I would have if I did not read IDENTITY CRISIS. What was the author's motivation for a work that left many fans feeling violated as they helplessly watched one of the most benign/likeable characters in the DC universe being subjected to one violent atrocity after another?"
1,Skinniest Baby Name Book Ever,"Thinking this book would provide some unique, ""exoticos"", ideas for baby names I ordered it even though IT IS ENTIRELY IN SPANISH.Basically it's a guide for Hispanics not to give their kids reoccuring names and therefore suggests a few names from different cultures including American (e.g. Kenneth).Also, if 110 pages weren't short enough the print and spacing are so large that the book is mostly blank when compared to other naming books that cram the info in.As an alternative I would suggest checking out ""Como te Ilamas Baby?"" which consists of seperate English & Spanish sides to accomodate sharing between friends or generations."
5,Top notch acid house & breaks from Andy Hughes & friends!,"What 1998 was all about for the MAFDDAP crew: trippy grooves, acid lines to melt your brain and stompin' beats to move your feet. Markus Schulz seamlessly mixes house & breaks throughout the mix in a wonderful tribute to MAFDDAP's early tunes. At least a top 5 in my all-time favorite electronic CD list.Track Listing:01 - Mike & Charlie - I Get Live (AGH Remix)02 - DJ Sandy - Sandyman (AGH Remix)03 - The Huggie & Coochie Project - Daybreak (AGH Bonus Dub)04 - Window Seat - Understand the Beat05 - AGH - Make it Happen (House Dub)06 - The Sexy Sevannah - Trailer Trash07 - AGH - Hydroplane (DJ Sandy Remix)08 - Neurologic - This is Fresh09 - AGH - Bastille Day (Red Void Remix)10 - Beyond... & Back - You Only Live Twice11 - Beyond... & Back - Dyslexic Hypochondria"
4,Ver Useful and Easy to Follow,I found this book extremely helpful on my trip to Peru. Easy to follow and easy to understand. The book is separated into sections realted to hotel reservations; food; saying hello and greeting; etc. The book is small enough to carry in your back-pack. I found it extremely helpful and useful for basic communication in spanish. Good book to have.
2,Scratched and disappointed...,"All in all I like the look of the case. I was disappointed because the plastic base bottom is scratched where the ball prop would rest if there were a bunch of them stacked (as I assume they are in shipping from the factory). This scratch on the plastic reflects in the glass bottom.The BIGGER disappointment was the wood base corner that was scratched. I am pressed for time. I would have returned if time wasn't a factor. I did some filling in with Crayola crayons to match the color of the wood.Also the plastic shell case is not very sturdy, it is easy to construct, looks like a nice presentation and will be okay on a shelf but it would have to be somewhere without a lot of handling.I overpaid for this item but there wasn't much competition on Amazon for the price range. If it weren't for the scratches I would have been pleased overall. It did ship in a timely manner and is a nice presentation."
2,"Not bad, but better books exist.","He has some interesting points to make, but the book is very thin, and Mr. Best is a dull writer. For much better books on the same or similar topics, read recent books by Michael Shermer, Barry Glassner, or Wendy Kaminer."
4,Great Prog. mix from the top rated DJ,"Being a prog. house lover more so than trance I was a bit hesitant on buying a Tiesto mix. I purchased Nyana last year and it did not impress me a bit. I have seen Tiesto spin live and it was a great experiance, but he has never been on the top of my dj list. But with this mix he seems to be getting a bit more into the prog. style of mixing rather than just staying with the same old energetic trance. Now dont get me wrong this cd has plenty of prog. trance on it but he lays down some very nice prog. house as well (though the whole feel of the cd is prog. trance). I prefer cd 1 its a bit more chill and has more of a prog. house sound to it. tracks 5-10 are very nice (track 6 has a spanish guitar rift that jazzis things up a bit and then form there cd 1 gets into some very deep and nice prog.. Cd 2 is great as well just a bit with more of an up beat trance feel to it. Tiesto has done a fine job with this mix and any Prog. house/ trance fan is sure to enjoy it."
2,a big disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book. I have been a John Bonham fan since I was a kid. He was the reason I wanted to learn to play the drums. This book falls short by skating over many of the Led Zeppelin years. I have read both 'Hammer of the Gods' and 'Stairway to Heaven' and I had high hopes that this book would be as good as those, but just focused more on Bonzo than the whole band. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't cut it as a biography. It's got some neat photos and the analysis of Bonham's playing and his drum setups are great, but the rest of the book is more like a high school term paper. The authors should read 'Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in The Crossfire' by Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford for clues about how to write a biography, then try again to write a Bonham biography. The Led Zeppelin DVD is a FAR better investment than this book."
4,"Closer to ""The Time"" with a bit of fun thrown in","If you like Janissaries and Janissaries: Clan and Crown, you'll enjoy Storms of Victory. Things are getting closer to ""The Time"" and either destruction at the hands of the Shalnuksis and their human servants, or perhaps some alternate fate mediated by those same servants.It's fun, it's got long battle scenes, it's got Rick in trouble again and again, and a growing Wanax becoming quite a leader. The Romans are there too, and even a fairly high risk encounter with a safely fanatical (and therefore we know he is evil) religious leader.I kept hoping Jerry and friend would wrap this thing up in book III. Pity, they didn't! And now I see they've still not finished book IV. Pity.I first discovered books I and II some dozen years ago and enjoyed them immensely. Recent rediscovery was just as good as I remembered, even with the somewhat dated depiction of the main female characters.A very good read, especially for the war historians among us."
3,Good but not great.,"This book is the third in the Janissaries series. Having read the first two many times, I was excited to find that a third had been written and was very anxious to read it. The book started out very good and includes an appendix to help keep all the characters and geography straight. This was a big help as many of the characters have similar sounding names, and the maps are hard to read. In many ways, this book is the most well written of the three; and promised to tie up many loose ends that were left from the first two. Unfortnuately, it did not. I strongly suspect that the author planned to write a fourth book because the ending fell flat. No spoliers here, but there is at least one major question/issue that has been hanging on since the very begining that is not dealt with. Still, if you have read and enjoyed the first two, it is worth reading. Just be prepared for a little dissapointment at the end."
4,"Full of feeling and the truth about life,","Back from nothing was a great book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading. It had a lot of truth about the ""dark"" life that some people have. The detail and emotion keeps your attention. You can't put the book down until you have read the whole thing. Its great, go buy it."
4,Excellent product,"This is an excellent GPS unit. So far I've been able to find locations in the POI database that weren't available in my Magellan unit (although this unit is supposed to have a broader POI's database).The traffic feature is cool, but I hope it's coverage will increase fast enough. The blue tooth connectivity is probalby so far the best asset. I was really disapointed with the FM transmitter (I've tried all frequencies and I can hear more static in all of them that I can hear the actual sound being transmitted by the Unit (That's why I removed one star....)"
3,Disappointing Customer Service,"My nuvi 670 died shortly after the warranty expired. It cost $250 to repair, and the repair process took 5 weeks. The customer service reps I spoke to during the repair interval were unhelpful with status. The repaired nuvi just showed up with no notice at the end of week 5. The 'repair' turned out to be a 'replacement with a refurbished unit' so it's not clear what was so time-consuming about that process."
3,detailed but frustrating,I tend to give up on a game if I can't solve even the first two levels. This one needs some serious directions or you'll just go round and round in circles. The video cam movement is also extremely annoying by reorienting the view every two seconds in odd angles.
5,BEING ANNOINTED THE STEWARDS OF CREATION DOES NOT MEAN KILL IT AND GRILL IT,"this Fox teaches us.Yet his voice like so many other great and important voices of Christ was silenced long ago by the current resident of the great and universal throne of Peter.Go figure.GOd will win as GOd is love, and hate does not create."
1,Django Where?,"This documentary had zero footage of Django performing. Lots of filler graphics not needed and was long and dull.Audio was good and it was informative,just could have been way shorter way better and GET some licensing for video footage instead of spinning and flashing the same photo's. Not recommended."
3,Happy Days,"I just read Bair's book. Impressed by her diligence and appetite for detail. Some interesting insights: for example, she claims that much of the dialogue in Godot was taken verbatim from his conversations with Suzanne, his lover, while fleeing from Paris during the war years when his resistance circle was busted by the Nazis. On the minus side, much of her psychology is too simple-minded and pat, with too much emphasis on his love-hate relationship with his mother. Worst of all, time and again she claims access to his thoughts and feelings way beyond what she can possibly have known. So many contradictions in his character that after reading it, still have no idea what really drove him."
3,Pretty Okay,"It's not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo. It definitely added a bit of shine to my hair, but somehow it's become more tangle-prone since using it. I'd recommend this shampoo used with a de-tangler."
4,Used it for years,I really like this shampoo and have used it for many years. What's more is you can use it on your pets. I have two dogs.
2,Skip it!,"I bought this for my daughter to try. Her hair is thin and about 2"" past her shoulders. while using our regualr shampoo & conditioner, her hair was easily mangeable and looked and felt healthy.AFter using Mane n' tail, her hair felt thicker, dry, and tangled very easily. Working with her hair after using this shampoo was hard. I took her into the barber shop for a trim & the beautician commented on how dry her hair was. It was not dry before using this shampoo.Skip it! It's not worth damaging your hair. We'll stick to what's been working for us."
4,Worth Finding,"Long out of print, this book deserves a better fate than oblivion. Chase constructed an ingenious plot centered around the idea of co-evolution between humans and a distinctly alien species. The quality of writing is solid, and indeed, above average for books in this genre."
4,PSP Tiger Woods,"It's a lot of fun. Great graphics, easy to play. There aren't as many options as '05."
5,Excellent Price and Volume Study,Price and volume tell the tale for what is happening with a stock. The auther provides an excellent course on how to read the price ad volume action of a stock. No need for fancy wiz-bang technical indicators if you can read the tape.Get this book. Combine with all of Bill O'Neils books and you have a great foundation.
5,Billie at her very best,"""Solitude"" is a stunningly good album - warm, intimate singing from one of the premier jazz stylists, accompanied by steller jazzmen. It was Billie Holiday's first Verve album, and she is in fine voice - her slightly tangy timbre is well-captured by the Verve engineers, and she improvises with all her usual taste and subtlety. The songs, too, are great: many of them are poignant and a little melancholy, which creates a sustained mood of intimacy and worldliness. You simply will not hear a more convincing reading of Cole Porter's ""Easy to Love"" than here: it's a very hard song to get right, with its demanding intervals and sophisticated lyrics, but Holiday somehow manages to reshape the melody in her own style which mining a deep vein of understated passion. It's a wonderful example of her art."
3,"Helpful, but outdated","This is a very useful tool in the Law School application process. The 2-4 page descriptions of each school give you some added insight into schools you might be interested in that you can't get anywhere else.The one thing holding this book back is that it is ancient... the most recent edition was published in 1998. The law school world has changed drastically since then--the admissions process has gotten FAR more competitive, job prospects for lawyers have gone south, and technology plays a much bigger role in the classroom experience.For the most up-to-date info on admissions stats, use the official guide over at LSAC.org. This book is still worth reading for the school descriptions, but don't trust it as your only resource for choosing schools."
2,Basically the same as the 5th edition,"A friend loaned me the 5th edition of this book, which was published in 1991. It was a good book, but I wanted to read the ""updated"" edition so I would be familiar with how the law schools had changed in the six years in between. While reading the latest edition, I noticed that the only info that had been updated was the stats--most of the reviews and anecdotes about each school were the same--and I mean word for word! I guess things just don't change much in law school. I suggest spending your money on the LSAC guide to law schools, instead. Or send away for law school catalogs from each school--they're free and at least they are really updated each year!"
3,Remarkable story about the survival of Continental,"This book outlines the steps Continental CEO Gordon Bethune took to help the company survived its third bankruptcy. Well written, but can be boring if you are not into business strategy."
2,too repetitive,"I enjoyed the style of writing and the anecdotes. But for someone who was searching for a way on HOW they changed Continental, I was a little disappointed.Some of the explanations are enlightening and many others are standard textbook material. A crucial message is imparted on the reader, however the great disappointment is that this message is repeated over and over and over. You understand the point after 20 pages or so.A book for a junior in the airline business or just someone with a particular passion for the airline world. I don't recommend it to anyone who hopes to find complex explanations or examples in this book."
1,Worst Airline is still the worst,"The book may provide a business model but the airline has not ""come back."" Continental is still the worst run airline in the U.S. so the entire premise of the book is moot."
5,Thought was new,Thought it was new. Performance outstanding. Will definitely recommend to all my friends if they need a battery at a good price.
1,Not new and does not hold the charge,"The battery I purchased does not hold the charge and shows obvious signs of wear on its outside wrapping. It is clear that this is not a new product. I am returning this item and requesting a refund. Unfortunately, I am stuck with paying the postage. I do not recommend that you use the vendor I used when getting this product."
1,ripcord band,"Put it simply the product is garbage.Good idea ,but not well executed. The handle came off the Red cord after only a few uses.I felt it was not safe to use anymore."
2,"Poor quality, overpriced, disappointing","My 5 year old daughter so wanted a detective kit and purchased this with her own money. The plastic handcuffs broke almost as soon as she took them out of the box, the pen was dried out and the glow powder did not work. I can't see how the teeny tiny black light could be powerful enough to illuminate anything. Overall a cheaply made and disappointing product. We are returning it."
1,The Great Minds Series version has parts missing!,"I was origionally reading the text version of this book on the internet until the printed version came. I was downtroden, sickened, and even frightened to find that the Great Minds Series version of The Wealth of Nations is incomplete, yet gives no indication whatsoever of being so.The introduction and chapters 2, 3, and 4 of book 3 are simply not there. They are not even listed in the table of contents. There is no discrepency in the page numbers, or any other teletale indication that it is incomplete. It is not written anywhere that it is an abrigement.I want to point out how careless it is and how misleading to the reader in comprehending the philosophy of Adam Smith to print an incomplete book without any warning."
1,Book is free,"Look at the bottom of the Wikipedia page, there are links to the unabridged ebook for free in both kindle and the standard format (as the copyright is long expired)."
3,Review of Dickey's Abridgment (Hackett Publishing),"""The Wealth of Nations"" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."
5,WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN HAVING JERRY REED THREE TIMES ON ONE DISC????,"JERRY REED IS THE MEANING OF WHAT IS IS! SINGER,ACTOR,WRITER OF SONGS FOR ELVIS AMONG OTHERS! SIDE-KICK OF BURT REYNOLDS,CHET ATKINS(CGP), AND ME! CAN PICK THE GUITAR FASTER THAN YOU CAN THREAD A SEWING MACHINE, WITH IT RUNNIN'. SO, WHEN YOUR HOT YOUR HOT,TAKE ANOTHER PUFF AND TURN ON THE FAN, SLIP IN THIS DISC, AND ENJOY THE ALABAMA WILDMAN!! S0--------N!!!!"
5,All three in one place!,"Includes the all elusive SatB III! No stinky Burt or Sally, just Jackie and JERRY! Sooo happy I found this, and you will be too!"
5,"Smokey and the bandit ""Pursuit Pack""","Do yourself a favour and buy this great title, its worth every cent....."
4,Pretty good but...,"I'm a big fan of Burt Reynolds. I love the first Smokey and the Bandit. The second one was pretty good too. Not the same as the first but it still was ok. The third one though I just didn't think it was the same since Jerry tried to be the Bandit when he fit better as the Snowman. One thing I noticed with the pursuit pack is when Burt makes the cameo in the third Smokey and the Bandit, they cut like a couple minutes of him talking to Jackie out which in my opinion sort of ruined it. I have the original on tape and I happened to notice it. But, other than that even though the second and third weren't as good as the first, it still was a good idea. I have the first and second ones on dvd seperately from before too."
3,Great Car Chases in all but only the first has a story,"I love these movies for the Car Chases/Crashes. I recently purchased this set because I figured all three (...) I couldn't go wrong. Number 1 is very smoothly edited and has a decent story. Number 2 really does feel like a Cannonball run movie. Number 3 is painfull on a number of accounts, The girl is horrible as an actress or it was just a really poor character designed to provide a flashback joke or two. While some of the script is obviously hacked (words don't match the lips), there is a whole chapter in this DVD that should of bumped the rating to R because of the types of sex depicted even if for just a few frames. I don't think I have seen another movie get away with PG and show a womans full breast. Don't get me wrong I went looking here at amazon.com to see if there was an R rated release that might extend the scenes. But I would not show this to my 12 year old PG or not."
5,Excellent!,"The Olympus B-50SU 4 AA NiMH Batteries and Charger is the best! I used other ""low cost"" chargers and batteries which were completely useless after only a few months. The Olympus charger and batteries are still going strong! I would highly recommend this product for any camera which uses the AA NiMH batteries. I use them in my Minolta Dimage 5."
2,Lame!,"Looks like something that you'd find at the dollar store. Images are ok, just not worth the $5. Sent them back."
4,Great film but no widescreen,"This is one of my favorite action films of the eighties. It may also be one of my most favorite comedies of the eighties. Yes, it's so bad it's funny and it's so funny it's good. The only bad point to the dvd is that it is not in widescreen format. The picture quality is good but your still missing some of the picture without the wide screen. Hopefully MGM will release a special edition to this cult classic like they did with Escape from New York. A clue to the future-- this film is a couple of dollars more than parts 2 and 4. Does MGM realize this is a cult favorite?"
3,One of the best vigilante movies made,"This movie is so bad that it is good.Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) kills just about everybody in this movie. There are so many flubs, that it's impossible to list them all. He never runs out of bullets, never misses and can even shoot a .50 cal machine gun from the hip (with the bullets loaded backwards).For Star Trek fans, you get to see Marina Sirtis in a cameo part that was done way before she became famous.A must have movie for fans of pop culture. One of the most hilarious vigilante movies to come out of the 80's."
2,BRONSON RETURNS TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE,"Poor old Bronson doesn't have much luck. His friends and family keep getting murdered by low lifes. By this entry though he has no family left because his wife and daughter were killed in the first two movies. In this entry Bronson is visting an old army buddy, but when he arrives at his house he finds his friend's battered corpse. Immediately the cops burst in and arrest him, he is allowed to go free only if he wipes out the evil Straker and his fascistic gang. This is a pretty bad movie, though it has a welcome lacing of humor in it (well, I thought the guy getting a nail through his head was pretty funny) and some ludicrous dialogue, as well as an absurdly high body count. Unlike the disgusting DW2 (which I think is marginally better) it doesn't rely so much on sexual violence to repulse the viewer. Keep your eyes peeled for Alex Winter of the BILL & TED movies as a bad guy, and ST:TNG's Marina Sirtis as a rape victim.The music is once again by Jimmy Page."
4,Old School Action Movie,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!"
1,The worst Bronson movie ever !.,"I can't believe people rave about this piece of utter trash. Paycheque-acting, no story at all, completely unbelievable. This one makes ""Death Wish 5"" look like ""Citizen Kane"". No wonder old Charlie looks so embarrassed in this turkey. They haven't even bothered to write a new score. Comes to town, bang-bang, leaves. I love Bronson-movies, but this one's the pits."
4,The best of all the Death Wishes.,"They Killed The Giggler man! They killed him! Classic line. The Giggler being a purse snatcher who giggles when he snatches a purse or camera from a unsuspecting pedestrian. Naturally Bronson offs him with a .357 that fires shells that could kill an elephant. Great acting by all, including the main villian, who sports a reverse afro, that even Larry Fine from the 3 Stooges would be proud off. Look for Marina Sirtis of Counselor Troi of Star Trek fame making an early acting appearance."
4,Death Wish3 dvd,I really enjoy the Death Wish movies. If you like the average man getting real justice on criminals this is for you. Taking the law into your own hands justice.
1,Needs an updating,"I borrowed this from my local library, and although it does seem helpful, I'm going to have to purchase a newer volume that was written after the dawn of the internet age.While the author spends most of the introduction explaining what a technical marvel WordPerfect is, there is no mention of doing invesment research using the internet. Although I'm sure there is lots of other information here, this shortcoming has proven fatal to me.At least I didn't *buy* it!"
1,grass,big waste of money no grass grew and i had the perfect conditions and followed the directions to the t but nodda
2,Not sure for this product,"I live in north NJ. I overseeded my front yard with Canada Green Seed in the middle of September. Watered twice a day every day, about a week, it started germinating and within a month, my front yard looked good. HOWEVER, now that spring comes, my front yard is dead again..... This past winter was very mild. I have to do overseeding again. But this time, I use different brand and see what happens. I wasted my money on Canada Green."
1,Dried up bag of crap!!!!,"The bag of grass seed has'nt sprouted diddley, I've got pictures , it's the perfect weather and the rain is consistant, and to top it off, Iuse miricle grow garden soil of which I have pictures and reciepts !!!!IT'S GARBAGE ,PROBABLY LEFT OVER FROM LAST TEARS SALES....."
1,canada green grass seed,Very disappointed in this. It is supposed to be guaranteed to grow ANYWHERE. I put it in my dogs run which is very shady and nothing - haven't had luck with any grass so far. Definately would not order this.
1,"bad quality, does not grow.","I sped the seed, even with rain the seed did not cover what the package indicated, not even close."
3,Interesting facts!,"Liked that the writer did his homework and revealed facts that were not known to the public at the time. Book ended too soon though page wise thought, it would be a longer book."
1,Piece of Crap,I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works
5,One of the true masters.,"If I could sing like anyone who has recorded in the last 100 years, I would choose Joe Williams. Lou Rawls felt pretty much the same way, admitting that early in his career he patterned his style after that of Mr. Williams. The first of these discs reprises his career with the Count Basie Orchestra while the second is a collection of songs from his ""revival"" period in the 80s and is live tracks with a small group. Both are superb examples of a master. If you're not familiar with Joe Williams, this is an excellent introductory set. If you are, get it anyway, you won't regret it."
2,Hinges break easily,I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke.I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat. My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me.However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use.Even when using the leather case you'll still want to use the flip cover. The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained. The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case.
5,Read at least read one book by Robert Capon.,"Capon is very sound, and you will see he is very, very different.He will paint a picture to your ear that will last.After reading several of his books, I had to talk to him. I called his church and asked him what helps you come up with great ideas to deeply communicate such difficult concepts? A gracious and warm man said, I read the Bible and it flows out."
1,Jewish Good Arab Bad,"This book contrasts sharply with his Arab Mind. Reading the two together, one can see clearly Mr. Patai's bigotry and hate of Arabs. For a professor who is said to have held high positions at prestigious US universities, I found his stereotypical writings quite scandalous. However, when I balanced this with the fact that his is the son of a well known Hungarian Zionist, I came to realize that his agenda could easily be understood (the vast majority of people hostile to Arabs are Jews). Added to this, his work is highly descriptive and speculative - reinforces the view that Anthropology is not really a science."
3,"The Western man...and I know, 'cause I'm one!","This book is a Western, which made me give it three stars because Westerns are always too slow. It did have action, though, and was a great start for me and the other seventh graders in my reading class. Read it, y'all."
2,Horrible and pointless,"I had to read this book for school and I hate it. It's too detailed and far too complex for my taste. About 2 chapters of the book talks about a man and Shane chopping at some big old stump, and the characters are all astonished and proud of them. It really makes no sense to me. I do not recommend this book to ANY high-school student if you need to read a book for school."
2,VERY BORING and could not keep my attention,"The book started out extremely boring and it took me a while to get into it. There are 16 chapters and it got a little better in about chaper 14. The book does have great quotes and figurative language, but other than that I would not recommend this book to readers. I did not enjoy it at all. Please so not waste your time on this book. It may be all right for adults, but it just does not keep kids attention."
5,An American Classic,"From The Scarlet Letter to Wise Blood, American literature is known for its short novels, and this is a great one. Schaefer took the simple, direct prose style of Twain and Hemingway and used it perfectly, carefully weighing every word for emotional effect.The book is usually kept in the children's section of bookstores, because the vocabulary is basic. It was the first I ever read, when I was seven or eight. But it is a great book for anyone, crackling with tension. The first page alone is worth the price."
5,Superb Americana!,"Of the hundreds of books I've read, this is the one that I've re-read the most. To say that this is a classic would not do it proper justice. In a short, compact narrative, Mr. Schaefer manages to convey an unforgettable sense of a time, a place, a man and his destiny in a most accurate, convincing fashion. The movie version, as good as it was, does not come anywhere close to the book, and this is due in part to Alan Ladd's portrayal. Again, Alan Ladd was a great actor, but he carried none of the implied menace that the book's character had. This is a great book for first-time readers, in its depiction of right, wrong and the price each carries. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,Ramandeep lehal,"I read this book few months ago this a book about a guy who is atough guy he is hard worker and strong he never tells any body about himself he just say ""call me shane"". once he went to valley and he settle thier with Joe starret as a coworker than see what's next....."
3,Super Reader,"Not quite as enjoyable at the first. Kane returns to Mars after getting some help and financing in building a machine, especially from an author acquaintance looking to recount his tales to the public.He helps yet another rebellion succeed, fights some spider monsters, builds an airship, stops a war, and returns to find he actually has come back to the same time period, as his betrothed is still hanging around."
3,Small and ordinary,"I agree with some other reviewers that the size is a bit smaller than expected. It is quite ordinary set, you wouldn't want to use it for heavy weight drapery. I would recommend it if you just have some light stuffs to hang, and you don't want to spend much money - they are quite inexpensive and not easy to find from local stores."
4,Cool Game......,"This game is pretty good. If you are on a road trip in the car I would highly reccomend this game. The only thing that ... me up is that after every season game you have to write down a password. I keep losing my passwords! The graphics are O.K., but every player looks exactly alike; a skinny black player that looks almost dead. One more ... is the player advantages. Sammy Sosa may hit no better than someone like Otis Nixon, you see what I mean? Overall, this game is so and so."
2,Broken Pen,"The pen itself was visibly as depicted: a Murano-style glass pen, with all the slight irregularities that should be expected of hand-shaped glass. I could not rate how the ink flowed from the pen, as the pen had been very poorly packaged and had arrived broken in two places. Most disappointing, as this pen was intended to be given as a gift."
5,Master Story Teller,"This is the first Rick Bass book I have read, I will now buy everything he has ever written, he is that good. For those of us who don't need murder and mayhem in every book or movie, Rick Bass offers stories which will stay with you for a lifetime."
3,good,"This book is about a half German half Russian boy whose name is Eric and he is sent to the war to fight on the German side. In the war he is badly wounded and he finds a dead Russian boy and changes clothes with him, he is took to a Russian hospotal and he survives because he looks and can talk Russian, he falls in love with a Russian girl named Tamra,Tamra takes care of him and then they escape and get married and lived happily ever after. I think people should read this book because the reader can learn so much about the war and what types of things were going on during that time. If anyone is looking for a good adventerus book to read this is the book for them. The book soldier x takes a while to get into but when you do you will not want to stop reading it. This is why i think everyone should read this book."
5,scary and gross,"This book was very horrifing. It sounded very gross that they would take dead bodys stab them with a boyonet, lift the body up so that the body would dangle and skewered. I thought it was smart that he dressed like a Russian so he couldn't be killed while spying. So you can see that this book is for people who like gross adventures and a book never to be read before bed![ will give nightmares]!"
5,"I had read this book a long time ago, but I did not remember it.",After I start to read it I could not put it down. Very intense book. The second part was better than the first one.
2,Dragged on too long,"The book is almost 500 pages and it took about 250 to get to the intersting parts. The character development is incredible but the whole time you're like ""well, when are they gonna be connected?"" I previously read ""Rage of Angels"" by Sheldon and enjoyed that a thousand times more. I was a disgusted by Larry and especially Noelle. Adultury is a SIN!!!!!!!! I was disappointed to see Sheldon make it seem like it was no big deal. Not everyone has affairs and it is not normal. His book makes you believe it's OK to Sc**w the world. He's a great writer but I don't recommend this one."
4,Another quality Bruce Wagner book!,"While not quite up to the standards of 'Memorial' his most recent (?) and definitely best book, 'the Chrysanthemum Palace' once again reveals Wagner's acid wit, viscious satire and fantastic writing. It can't be easy to create a book with 3 main characters who are all basically unappealing people, yet make you despartely yearn to find out what happens to them, and Wagner deserves credit for that. This is a well-written book about Hollywood, but not just about Hollywood. Definitely recommended, 'Memorial' is his high bar at the moment, although that is an incredibly dense and long and intricate work, this is a little easier to absorb, but still quite good!"
2,its okay,"the brow powder its just ok. I just wouldn't expect this from a product that cost almost $30.00, for me it should cost like $6.00. It doesn't stay on for long and if you have dark eyebrows like me you cant even see that is on."
3,quilt review,"I loved the design but it is not a good quality cotton, even after washing it doesnt feel comfy,"
5,Lines up with the view of most evangelicals...,"R.C. Sproul is one of the finest preachers in the nation! His books are even better! Agree with nearly everything he says in this delightful, easy-to-read book."
4,My Opinion,"The Jwin player itself is great. I would recommend this to anyone. The problem is, it was misadvertised, it DOES NOT play MP3s, only CDs."
5,Just the Best,"For every dog lover there is this gem of a book. I have read it and re-read it and read it again. I have bought at least 20 copies to give as gifts. If you have never read it, get it now and I guarantee it will sit in a place of honor in your home!"
3,A lot like homework,"When I'm self-delusional, I say I liked this movie. A more honest assessment is that I like the idea of this movie. I would agree that the length of La Belle Noiseuse is necessary to convey its message; I just wish that there was a way to have a neural implant of the memory of the movie (ala Total Recall) instead of actually having to watch it. It is a lot like homework—you’re glad for having the knowledge, and nothing can replace it, but wouldn’t it be nice to not have to do it?La Belle Noiseuse is an important movie. But much like the art of painting it depicts, watching the art of this film is a brutal, exhausting experience."
1,Treasure Island,"Treasure Island, this classic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, is filled with literary devices and suspense that keep the reader interested until the end. This irresistable book is a must read for all people who love an extraodinary, intense, and action filled novel. This book was the worst book I read. ""Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol shots, and one loud groan, rang in my ears."" this magic three that was used in the story gives the reader and idea of what was going on through Jim Hawkins's eyes."
5,Yes!,This is one of the greatest adventures of all time! I love this story. No movie has ever done it justice.
3,Treasure Island,"I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good. And it was a free download"
1,Not good,Did not like the book really boring might be a classic .but I'm to good for this horrid book sorry
2,Poor eBook Conversion,"Good book, but it was formatted for kindle terribly. The table of contents doesn't link, there is lack of page breaks and contained lines break mid sentence. It was very distracting."
1,worst book ever!,i read 5 pages and i did not under stand 1 wordi hated every single word and thing in the book!
2,Dull.,"Pirates. Ships. Treasure. Gold. The Sea. Do all these things come to mind when you hear about the title? If you like these kinds of things, read this book.I found this book kind of boring because it did not have enough suspense, excitement, and comedy. I know they say this story is a classic, but to me, this story is a classic bore!"
2,A Pirate Review,"I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this."
2,Typo on the first page? Really?,"Look for another copy. This one has a typo on the FIRST page. ""...keeping nothing back but the beaings [sic] of the island..."""
4,How could I never have read this before?,This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
5,Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson,"This book is a hard-cover book with an unusual design on all sides of the cover. It has a nice face page followed by the Table of Contents which is well set up, followed by an Introduction which gives a good history of Robert Louis Stevenson. Although the book was originally written more for boys, several of my friends and I enjoyed the book in our pre-teen years. There is also a page of ""Suggestions for Further Reading."" The book is broken up into six areas each with three to seven parts. Pre-teens and teens may find the book interesting as it contains mystery and much adventure which takes place back in the days of large sailing ships and pirates. There is an APPENDIX A: 'MY FIRST BOOK"" (1894) andAPPENDIX B: TALES OF A TRAVELLER at the end of the book.Adults who like adventure stories might enjoy this book as well."
1,Yo ho ho? I dont think so!,"This book is extremly confusing and i found myself thrusted into a world i had no idea about. I respect the authors writing style but as a person knowing nearly nothing about the world of pirates, i found myself not wanting to read any further than the first 10 pages. This is truly sad, as i am a fan of classic novels."
1,In A nice Way.....,"Well on top of it all i didnt enjoy the book well! It totally bored, me and I didnt comprehend it!!!! It made no sense!! It depends the kind of person u are! If u like looking 4 treasure maps... well ,then try it!"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"this is the most boring book i have ever read....the dialouge is so confusing,so my advice is don't waste your time on reading this book!"
5,Classic story,Wonderful read and I was not disappointed in this classic. I would suggest it to anyone wishing for adventure and with old English to boot.
3,Treasure island,"I didn't understand what it's about and the words were confusing. The book was boring and very,very long. Weird book"
5,Great read,One of the great classics by RLS. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it again on Kindle. Was a good one to get familiar with my new Kindle Fire.
4,"Good Sandle, Bad Flask","Ok the sandles are comfy and cool looking but one of the caps on my flasks kept coming loose and on the second day i lost it while walking. They also should come with a funnel, its kinda hard pouring things into a 1 cm opening. so basically the flasks were almost useless, but the sandles are still good and thats the most important part, i should have gotten the bottle opener ones :-/"
3,Stripped Key Hole,"These sandals are super comfortable but I hadn't even worn them, but had only played with them before the key hole on the cap stripped. I would jsut recommend tightening and loosening the cap by hand."
3,"Good, but not Arkenstone's best.","I added this CD to my Christmas list based on the 5 starreviews here at Amazon. .... Now that I've heard it, I am a little disappointed.Had I heard this CD in 1987, I would have given it 5+ stars. Compared to similar current music and older works by other artists however, this one does not stand out.I have Citizen of the World and Quest of the Dream Warrior. Both are among my all time favorites. I wish I had requested another title for now. I would only recommend this one if you have all of David Arkenstone's CDs and want to complete your collection."
5,Vietnamese WomanTransports the Reader Into Her World,"This author's words flow with an honest and intimate voice that makes the reader feel like a privileged friend trusted to hear Lien `s life story from early childhood through adulthood in Vietnam and finally the short epilogue of her present life in Virginia. Often with the horrors of the struggles that engulfed her country and ours as backdrop, we learn in bare none detail how her family survived. In any setting this is a spellbinding story of a courageous woman whose honesty and humor about her own flaws and the dysfunctions of her family make you laugh, cry, and cheer her on in the end. After reading this first novel, I will look forward to reading more by this gifted voice."
5,You Can't Compare Apples and Oranges,"This CD is AMAZING. To compare it to ""New World"" is unfair to both composers. Both are wonderful recordings of great songs. Yes, these are more introspective, but beautifully so. I suggest buying both."
4,"Cute, Sappy Good Time",I recently watched this one again. It is totally predictable in every way. Sometimes that is a good thing. Belushi is wonderful in this film as are his co-stars.
2,Good book/bad shape,Maybe I was expecting too much for an older book. The book was listed as in good shape. It was in terrible shape. Binder coming off and pages falling out.
3,Deliberately Restrained,"At first listen, this 1985 release by Eberhard Weber comes off as slightly dull, plodding slowly along through seven self-titled tracks. Clocking in at just over forty minutes, the music on this CD is so languid it could easily be mistaken for being sleepy. A better term for the songs, however, might be deliberately restrained.Regardless of its title, ""Chorus"" is far more focused on the flashy spotlight solos associated with traditional jazz than the atmospheric ambient jazz soundscapes so often identified with the ECM label. Perhaps this is why many Weber fans are quick to dismiss this release as lackluster.Yet, I find ""Chorus"" to be an engaging and unique entry in the Weber catalog. Currently out of print, I can think of no other album recorded by Eberhard Weber (and I have most of them) quite like this one. It's not my favorite, but it is different. And in that sense it's interesting.I give it three and a half stars. Recommended."
2,Conceptual compositional constipation,2 1/2Another bloated Bass-capade that's not without its melodic punctuality but by and large limps and lingers to merely moderately moving music.
2,I own a Nikon 8400 and I'm considering this,"Battery pack, but frankly it's a bit too pricey. And appears it would clumbersome to use. Especially in the horizontal position as the viewfinder is in lower postion. Anyway, the whole idea is to have more power available vs the battery pack which comes with the camera.Just make sure you buy NiMH 2300-2000 AA batteries.Great concept, but a bit too expensive, Nikon needs to price it more like in the $75 dollar price range, but consider extra battery packs cost only $42, well. You can see my point of view.You can buy alot of battery packs for $170 bucks.If you get one of these, make sure you post a review and what type of photography you do."
4,A instruction book that goes a little bit more.,The Tarot of the Old Path: Instruction Book is more than a standard tarot instruction book. There is a background on Tarot as well as background information relating to the various contributors to this Tarot Deck. I've also discovered simple Tarot exercises and spreads within this book. A great addition to my collection.
3,Far from perfect,"I agree with other reviews that this device does NOT work with ironing boards with angled legs (as pictured). You do need a T-leg board.It is also a bit fickle with the size of the iron. If your iron is either really wide or really thin, it may not sit in the holder very well.You also need to be gentle when closing the door that this is hanging on. While the top part stays secure, the bottom part of the iron can still swing. I have gotten used to this over time.Other than that, it is a better looking device than some other ironing board holders. It's not very bulky or complex."
1,Doesn't work,"We do not have a heavy ironing board, but apparently it is too heavy for this. I've tried to hang the ironing board inside the closet and the apparatus keeps the door from completely closing. When we hang it outside the door, same frustrating situation. I have a cat that loves to sleep inside the closet and she leaves her beautiful white hair over every shoe and piece of clothing in the closet. So I now have one useless metal contraption hanging over my door and an abundance of cat hair in the closet. I definitely do not suggest you buy this over-the-door ironing board hanger unless you have an extremely light ironing board (maybe a mini board will work?) and no cat/dog in the house. There has got to be a better designed product to help store the board."
5,Perfect for applicants,"I am an educational counselor and received all four of the new ""Essays That Worked"" books recently. These newly revised editions are perfect for any applicant stumped by or anxious about writing a personal statement. The essays are inspiring, and the advice is frank and fresh. The authors did a great job of updating these classics, and I highly recommend them to anyone applying to college, law school, business school, or med school."
2,"Maybe I would Have Liked it better if I was a ""dummie""","As a practising astrologer, I try to read as many books on astrology as well as how to books for the subject, so that I may learn new techniques with which to teach people who are not yet familiar. I found this book to be condesending to the reader, though perhaps the author meant this to be comical. I did not find the humour and felt as though he was attempting to talk down to the reader rather than simplify astrology. Overall this is an extremely generalized book and not very helpful for anyone who really wants to seriously study astrology. I did not even feel that this would make a good reference book."
5,More then I had hoped,"This book was more then i had hoped, I love it! The cover is great and the pages very well set. Thank you so much!, More then pleased!"
3,"Cute, well priced but not as soft as it should be",I bought this hat and the matching blanket with feet for a friend's baby shower. Both are cute. The fleece isn't as soft as I'd like it to be for a baby (certainly nothing special) but it works.
4,"It is light and pleasant novel. Well written, as are all her books.","It is possible to read, put down and pick up again without losing thought processes. Have read it prior and seen the movie. Like that era as well."
2,Uuugghhhh,"Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"
4,Nothing new to say about this book,"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews. This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated. I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly. The end did feel a little rushed. However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.Specific to Kindle: Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation. While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying."
3,fantastic,"It's another great book of Jane Austan. I really enjoy her writing and endings,especially this one of Jane's. This is (I think) the last book Jane wrote before her death."
4,'Persuasion' is Jane Austen at her finest,"I've just finished reading 'Persuasion' and I loved it. At first glance Anne Elliot is somewhat of a doormat; then we learn that she is the only unselfish and rational member of her family, who has been putting their needs before hers for the last eight years and is finally sick of it. I was delighted at Jane's - whoops, I mean Anne's - rebellion against her position and her coming into her own as a woman deserving of love."
5,Simply wonderful!,"I have to agree with the other reviewers of Jane Austen's Persuasion: this has to be one of her best works. The poignancy of the emotions throughout the novel were so present, so real. The writing drew me into the story, and I could hardly put the book down. Was the language too flowery? Not at all. It was beautiful. And I was quite sorry to see the words ""The End.""There is something to be said about a book that captures the imagination and piques the curiosity. This book is one of them."
3,Pursuasion,Pursuasion was one of the few Austen books I had not read. I would hate to think it was someone's first Austen book because they may not come back and read some of her true greats.
4,"Challenging book, but good read","Ms. Middlebrook provides an extremely detailed look into the life of Anne Sexton. By using interviews, Sexton's writings and recordings of Sexton's therapy sessions, Middlebrook leaves no stone unturned in her lengthy book on Sexton. I enjoyed the book, but found I could only read a few pages at a time due to the wordiness and technical jargon (particularily in the sections dealing with Sexton's mental illness). Overall, however, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to admirers of Sexton or fans of good biography."
2,Magic Wand,I can't say much yet. I purchased this as a beginning maguc trick for a friend's daughter. It did arrive very promptly though.
5,A must have for the traveler,"I don't know what I would do without this. My Kindle, CD audio player and Sony movie player all fit in for air. plus room for discs."
4,almost worked,"Everything was good on this case except the outside plug for the ear phones had a short in it and only worked if you twisted it around, and then only worked a short time. I cut it off and use the case without it."
2,mixed,"This book is really awkward. There is some standard many body theory but no beginning student will be able to learn it from this book alone. Second of all there are some very awkward statements like ""fermions ..behave like non-local excitations because fermions cannot be created alone."" (p146)While his line of reasoning for a particular model is decently clear, the statement about the nonexistance of a lone fermion is ridiculous. He makes occaisional grandiose statements like "" [his pet theory] provides and answer to the origin of light and fermions"" (p9). I find the calculations sketchy at best --you can learn deep things but at great expense. overall i find this book to mix ridiculousness and obtuse reading with insight. I think it's a poor book because pedagogy should be paramount in a textbook."
4,Both Conan's came in wide screen format....,"I almost did not buy the 2 movie package because I saw the reviews stating that conan the destroyer is not in 16:9 ratio..Well for the price i bought it anyway since I wanted both movies.Both Conan's came in letter box wide screen format..Someone is confused..Both movies look pretty good on a 47"" widescreen HDTV. Shading is a little off, but every outdoor movie is off do to sunlight..My main point of this review is to tell people that do not waste your money on 2 seperate movies by the box set and you will be more then happy."
2,Seperate the two.,"I don't believe this is a good buy. Even the best of fans should never own Conan the destroyer. Destroyer is a really bad movie. Barbarian is one of my favorite Arnold movies. The extended edition of Barbarian includes deleted scenes, A digital remaster of the decaying original. You get longer scenes of silence. Conan in the comics did contemplate in peace, a sharp juxtaposition to the man's violent side. The juxtaposition is balanced in the extended edition. I loved following along with the director and Arnold in the commentary. They pointed out the things I idly let pass. Each scene Arnold would try his hardest to remember how he had gone through the scenes. But it was a long time ago that he had done the movie. The director discribed the undertones of the movie. Even aside from all the trivia information, it was just fun listening to the two. They were very light hearted and sounded like great friends. Buy conan the Barbarian, not this collection of the two."
2,Song on the Practice Field,"G Dub, the name of the song is A Poor Man's Memory by Explosions in the Sky"
5,love it!!!!,love that this one has more size options than the other keurigs and that the water reserve is so big. It cuts down on having to fill it.
5,Chose the winner,"Have several models. Did my research and this one won, a bit more expensive...the blue lights make it awesome ,and I love it."
2,Loved it but it's dying after less than two years....,"Mine has worked perfectly as far as brewing, no priming errors etc. Over the last couple of months it's been having power issues though. It will randomly shut off, the menu won't work etc. I called Keurig and they say nothing can be done and offered to sell me a new one discounted for 79.99. I'm conflicted since I love it so much(I'm the only person in my family that drinks coffee) and use just the hot water feature often to make tea. Thinking of trying the new Bunn but it does not have a reservoir or an off button. I just hate to give repeat business to Keurig for these makers that don't last very long for how expensive they are. My brewer is about 20 months old."
1,i'm on my 5th replacement machine!!!,"I have had 4 faulty Keurig brewers! They have each said ""prime"" on the screen and Keurig has replaced each one and acknowledged there is a problem. They are sending me my 5th brewer which is an upgrade that I argued for because the other 4 have been so bad. They claim the problem is fixed but you could have fooled me as I'm on my 5th brewer in 8 months! I love how the machine operates and the coffee is really good, I just wish they would fix the flaw. On the upside, the customer services people are very friendly! So, purchase at your own risk, if it works, you will love it!"
5,The Best customer service,"Let me start by saying I haven't had the best luck with my Keurig Coffee Maker. When I first received it the hinge on the lid to the water reservoir was broken. Within two months of having it the system refused to Prime w/o having to constantly take the reservoir on and off. So you may ask why I give it 5 stars... Well each time I had an issue I called customer service and didn't received a run-a-round phone call or extensive ""trouble shooting"" hoops to jump through. Each time it was a simple ""I'm sorry, let me send you out the replacement to fix the issue"". No shipping was charged and I received the new items in about 1 week after the call.I've been very happy with the convenience of the unit and I think I end up saving money since I make one cup at a time instead of whole pots which sometimes get wasted depending on my coffee mood for that day."
4,Great for a single guy,"Pros:Easy to use.Just the right ammount of coffee.Simple clean up.Good Selection of coffees.Great Customer Support.Cons:Coffee is a little weak, need to use two pods if you want it stongPods can be hard to find and expensive if not ordered from Amazon [...]Broke within two months. (Wouldnt register Pod, went through all the troubleshooting, but 'K' sent out a replacement ASAP and no problems since.This is the perfect at work coffee maker or for someone who's the only coffee drinker at home. Its great for the coffee drinker who values ease of use slightly ahead of taste. The coffee could be a little stronger.Go with the bold stuff even if you like mild coffees!"
1,Total Junk,Keurig B70 failed within 30 days. A total engineering and quality failure. Won't pump water to fill a cup and the LCD display started to fritz out. Save your time and get a plain drip maker. Keurig quality has gone totally south and they aren't interested in taking care of their customer. We will never buy another Keurig product ever!!!
1,No Parts?,"We had this thing for slightly over a year and it quit working. After two nights in the garage I finally managed to get the thing apart and found out a water solenoid was bad. Guess what, you can't buy parts according to Keurig. How green is that. I don't mind spending alot for a nice machine like the Keurig but for gods sake it should be fixable. Next time it's a cheap Mr Coffee so I can chuck it. Sad world!"
1,We have a graveyard of these at my office.,"Long story short, it is a bad idea if your buying these for an office space. They are not meant to handle the usage. Pumps and other problems arise quickly. We have about 5 bad at our office."
1,Stopped working properly after 1 week,"I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition, every other cup was luke warm at best. If it worked as it was intended I would recommend it highly but instead I am extremely dissappointed at the poor quality of the product.."
2,It will die sooner than expected,"I bought a Keurig B70 in October 2009 and absolutely loved it until it died this month (January 2011). The machine is great, I love being able to buy different flavors and coffee/tea/cider/hot chocolate k-cups to brew in an instant with no mess. However, for $175, I would have hoped it would have lasted more than 14 months. Like other customer reviews, the problem with the machine is that it would say it was brewing, but nothing happened. I tried everything to get it to work (descaling, clearing needle head, etc), but nothing worked. It's pretty disappointing....I figure it cost me $12.50 per month while the machine worked, and I am okay with that cost in return for the convenience of brewing a single cup at a time. I'm going to buy a second machine, but if it also stops functioning within a year or so, I will not return to Keurig as a future customer. Let's cross our fingers and hope for the best. Coffee sustains me."
1,Done with Keurig,Purchased the B70 as a christmas gift for my daughter who will soon be leaving the nest. We did not make it through even one box of the K-cups before having problems. It would brew about a teaspoon of coffee and quit. I had a friend over when I tried to make him a cup. He said there were tons of these returned to Costco because of problems. Back it goes. Many thanks to Amazon for having a great return policy.
1,Not reliable at all,I bought 3 KeurigsKeurig B70 Platinum Brewing SystemB70 Platinum for the offices - All 3 of them failed within 15 months - I used gallons of white vinegar to clean them up - I wasted hours trying to reset them - They would work for other 2 months... then back to needle and vinegar... - The last one felled to rage taking over - It didn't like being smashed to pieces...I would definitively recommend this product if you need to estimate the ultimate limit of your patience - Trust me you will find out!
5,love it!,I would buy it again! My family loves coffee and this is a quick way to have coffee without having to make a whole pot for 1 or 2 people. Saves on cost of coffee.
1,Went Dead After Only 2 Weeks,"I bought this maker online cyber Monday. Got it a little over two weeks ago. Woke up yesterday morning and it was dead...the clock was still showing time on the digital display but the rest was dead. I unpluged it and pluged it back in, then everything was dead including the clock. The package date on the box said 2/2011. Keurig has known about problems with the design of this model for years as evidenced by numerous complaints. No excuse for continuing to put a clearly defective product on the shelf at such a hefty price. I opted to not call Keurig and ask them to send me another. I returned it to the retailer and bought the Cuisinart instead."
2,Great in theory but constantly clogs,coffee grains get clogged in the water lines and I have to unclog daily....I am on my second machine in a month. Love the idea of the machine but just doesn't work well in reality.....
1,Built in obsolescence?,"Our 2nd Keurig Platinum in 3 years is now doing it's 'end of life' tricks. Descaling light comes on immediately after descaling. We use filtered water and descaled this one ahead of the regularly scheduled process. Spent too much time on the phone with a technician to learn the fine art of unclogging the sharp piece that pierces the cup. That trick lasts for one maybe two cups of coffee, then descaling flashes again. Shortly after that, we start getting 'short' cups...the pump is not pulling in the appropriate amount for the size chosen. Over $300 wasted with Keurig. You've lost another customer, and have warned friends who saw this in our home and were considering making a purchase to stay away from this model and proceed with caution with other models."
1,On my third one now and maybe the last one,While I love the ease and variety this machine offers...the quality is horrid. I have gone through two machines already and I am going to try a different model in hopes I can get one that will work. I love it when it works...which is for about 3-4 months then it stops drawing water and brewing a full size cup.
5,The perfect brewer,"This model is better than the basic Keurig. I really think if you can't brew the perfect cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc with this machine with its multiple cup size settings, then you just cannot be pleased by anything ever!! I hate to go camping now because I can't take it with me!!"
3,I am not blown away by it!,"Really disappointed in this as an upgrade from the limited edition below it. It is real close to the largest amount of coffee that will be dispensed from the other one and it makes no sense to have a choice of 5 different sizes of coffee to be honest. Also the hottest the coffee can get is 192 and that really isn't a big plus in the end. After spending money for this, I have went back to using the one I had before (limited edition). There is not real significant diff. Also, the filter doesn't make a diff to me or I do not notice any difference. I wish that I did not purchase the B70. Sam's sells it for same price online, as I seen after the fact."
5,Keurig does it good,"I received used Keurig from a shop that served it regularly (they went out of business). It has worked great from the get-go. I am amazed at the variety of K-cups there are. I only drink decaf, but have on hand a few regular cafe for friends and family. Only one I didn't like was the hot cider, it was sooo weak. I got away with the half cafe for three days and then came the roaring headache. I set it aside too. But I love my keurig and wouldn't give it up for love or money."
1,Repeated Pump Failures,"After having 5 of these machines in the last 2 years I can say without question that Keurig does not make a quality product in the B70, B60, B40. Keurig's customer service did replace two of the brewers free of charge, but every time they fail in the same manner, the pump stops drawing in water and therefore doesn't make a cup of coffee.Please vote with your dollars and purchase another version of the single cup machine. I also have an old (+ 3 years) keurig desktop brewers in which you have to fill the stainless reservoir before each cup and it works great to this day."
1,COMPLETE JUNK,"For the first six months I absolutely loved this machine. The ease of making a single cup of coffee throughout the day made it vastly superior to making a whole pot that lost flavor as time went on. However, after about six months the machine started making 4 ounce cups rather than 8 ounce cups. I have used only filtered water since day one and had descaled the machine as well to prevent any mineral buildup. After numerous calls to Keurig and researching the issue on the web I could not change the short cupping problem. It seemed as though the water pump was just giving out. At about 8 months the machine finally stopped working altogether. Have seen reviews of the Keurig OfficePro line that are positive and have decided to give that one a try. While supposedly containing a noisier water pump the machine does not seem to stop working suddenly. Will update this review after using the Keurig OfficePro."
2,One chronic problem that will drive you nuts,"When the Keurig machine functions properly, it's a great machine. I own three of them, but I'm replacing them with the Breville unit. The problem is that the Keurig machines constantly, and I mean constantly, go out of prime. That means you'll put in your k-cup, press the button and ... it sits there. Nothing happens. Or you'll select a cup size and a fraction of that amount will dispense. Workarounds include turning the machine on and off, lifting the handle up and back down, lifting off the water reservoir and putting it back on. As I said, I own three of the machines and all of them manifest the same problem. The workarounds usually eventually work, but at this price one would expect a more stable functioning machine. I have had no such problems with the Breville, not once."
5,So easy my 8 yr old makes my coffee for me!!!,"I love my machine.I love the convenience. I love the coffee and teas available.No cleaning messy pots and dealing with filters. It's so easy to use and maintain.It has a sleek looking design.I can make any size coffee/tea I need, I love the black teas. You must stock up on coffee/tea, not easy to find in all local stores I found we use the machine so much, we joined Amazon Prime!!!It is loud, but ony for the minute it brews.My 1st Unit broke, and Keurig replaced, no hassles, they were great. No overnight shipment, but I realized I LOVE MY KEURIG!!!!"
2,Built-in Obsolescence,"When I first received the B70 model, I was pleased and purchased a wide variety of flavors. I showed it off to my friends and we had wonderful ""coffee klatches"" over the 4 years that this brewer worked. But then the problems started. Just take a look at the videos and you will see what can go wrong. Once the problems start, they escalate and you start wasting k-cups, doing a variety of cleaning tasks in order to produce a cup and over time, the one-cup feature loses any value because you simply cannot produce a cup of coffee. The only solution is to buy a new brewer...well the performance of the old brewer certainly discouraged me from buying a new one, even at discount!"
1,How could this get a 4 star rating????,Problems right out of the box--same issues everyone else has. Someone must have stuffed the review box because all of the reviews I saw were bad. We are returning it. Next time I will check reviews BEFORE we buy. (I can't believe we didn't do that)
2,Watery Defect....,I am now on my 2nd B70 at home and I have a 3rd at my office. For those who have posted that the coffee tastes watery and bland your unit is defective. The 1st one I brought home made watery coffee that tasted like bad airline coffee. We called Keurig and they said return it for an exchange. I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation. The one at my office works fine.Obviously there is a defect that causes the unit to make watery coffee. So if your unit isn't making delicious coffee and tea the unit is bad. Doesn't say much for the build quality on this model.
2,Good when it works.,I had my Tassimo for about 4 years - never once had a problem. In fact I still have it...thank god because this is the third time IN ONE YEAR that I have had to pull it out to replace my keurig. this thing is ridulous - I don't use it any more than I did my Tassimo. If Tassimo just added more options my Keurig would be in the garbage!
2,First One Worked Much Better,"Like others on this site, I bought a Keurig B40 over two years ago. It only had one 7oz button choice. That Keurig is still working great and makes a great cup of coffee/tea. We bought the Keurig Elite last year, and we really don't like it. The coffee taste is just ""off"", and it often spurts and sputters, works slowly and then makes an insipid cup of coffee that is the wrong size. After buying 3 of them, throwing out one and returning the other 2, I think this 2nd B40 model has problems. Apparently the company is not making just the simple Keurig B40 with one 7 oz coffee button, so now we are going to try a mini in hopes that the simpler machine will perform like our first one. Good luck everyone. When you get one that works, you will love it."
5,Perfect cup every time.,"I have been hesitant to buy one of these coffee machines since my last purchase of a Senseo a few years ago. I loved the idea of making one cup of coffee at a time but, the Senseo style coffee pods were WAY TOO STRONG for me and the coffees made me sick! So, I had all but given up on these single cup machines. Then, the other day I was at a friend's house and she offered me a cup of the Donut House Coffee (which is a light roast). YUMMY!! I liked it so much that I ordered the Keurig machine the very next day. Wow!! I love this machine. It makes the perfect cup of coffee every time. So happy with my purchase. I just hope it lasts (and doesn't break down like so many here have described) since I will be using it allot."
1,Poor quality,"Had the B70 for 2/12 years. Come to think about it, the coffee it made was ok... not great. Always used water from the refrigerator which is filtered. It now says ""Not Ready"" and won't brew another cup.I called Keurig and described the problem. The gentleman told me that the unit was out of warranty, but that they would be happy to replace it with a new one. Of course, I was asked to pay for it. After reading the reviews and problems online, I'm not going to but another one of these units. I hope more people realize the poor quality of these units and avoid buying one."
2,It's basically junk.,"I've had the machine just under 90 days. About once a week, it fails to brew and there's nothing you can do about it except unplug it and try again - and that often takes several tries and 20 minutes - and you'll need to reset the clock each time.Sometimes the device pumps water back into the reservoir. Sometimes it pumps water all over the counter. Since I've missed Amazon's window to return the damn thing, I'll keep using it until it completely fails, but then it's back to Melitta cone drip coffee for me.At $150 for the machine and .80 a cup for just OK coffee, this machine isn't worth the expense OR the trouble. Do you have 20 minutes to spare in the morning trying to get some piece of junk to spit out a cup of joe before giving up and swinging by Starbucks instead? Me, either."
4,READ THIS IF YOUR B70 STOPS DISPENSING WATER AFTER A TIME,"Purchased the B70. A little big for me but worked OK till last week. No water dispense. Tried all the manual ""fixes"", till I went on the internet to do THE COMPRESSED AIR TRICK. IT WORKS. DO NOT throw out you B70 till you try this.1. Take a compressed air can used to clean computer keyboards.2. Remove water resivour3. Insert nozzle of air can into left and right silicon holes in upper portion of the unit4. Blow air through BOTH left and right holes in the silicone plug5. Repeat 4 times each blast 5 seconds eachYou will see bubbles and water come out of the bottom and the k cup needle if successful.This will fix your problem."
1,Piece of crap..!,"Mine quite pumping water after 8 cups. I should have known better since my oldest son had sent his back 3 times before getting one that worked. Now his is once again screwing up. I thought that for the amount of time this model had been on the market, it would have been fixed. I have an older B40 we have been using for a long time, but it is screwing up now. That's why I ordered this one. The B60 won't fit under our cabinets or I would have tried it. No more Keurig's for me. I will try another brand now."
3,Suggestions for dealing with a cranky brewer,"I own two Keurig Platinum brewers as I live in two homes, each for six months a year. Both machines became cranky after only several months of use, but after the one-year warranty was up. They would say ""brewing"" but nothing happened. Here's how I solved the problem: I unplug the Keurig after using. When I want more coffee, I plug it in and start it and it almost always works. Occasionally I've had to repeat the process. Also, when it is idle for several months, it refuses to work until I repeat the unplugging many times. Downside of this workaround is that you can't use the ""auto on"" or clock. But at least you don't have to throw the machine out!"
2,What's the point? Long term revenue.,"I recently experienced one of these appliances at my office where I was really impressed. Although we had to purchase our own K-Cups they ended up being relatively inexpensive ($.44/Kup) for the price of convenience. And so, I decided to purchase one for home. Then the problem started... K-cup prices skyrocketed... DOUBLING on Amazon to about $.90/Kup. I'm a sucker. I really wish I would have returned it. But I am far beyond the Amazon 30-day return policy. And so, the Keurig has been tossed into the garage sale pile.However, our Keurig has proved to be invaluable when anyone in the house is sick with the flu. Chicken broth, tea, and even Theraflu is effortless. If you have a home where this scenario is common, this appliance is perfect. But, the cost of the Kups are way to high for this to be any value."
5,I does it all!,"Let me tell you first, I don't drink coffee, I drink tea, my husband drinks coffee and my kids love hot chocolate. One machine, everyone's needs are met. We are thrilled!"
2,Worked for just over a year,"I purchase the Platinum B70 for my wife as an Anniversary gift. The coffee maker made it just over a year before we started getting the, ""Not ready"" that I have recently found out about. Not only do we get the not ready but the machine will turn on by its self and start spitting water out now. The only option for this machine now is the trash. It was great while it lasted. Guess we got one of the better built ones as it made it a year before crapping out.Update - 1 Feb 11 - we attempted to contact Keurig customer service to find out if the machine could be fixed. After waiting a month for someone from Keurig to contact me, the machine stopped working all together and is now in the garbage. I have since bought my wife a Bosch Tassimo and she very pleased so far."
5,I LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER!!!,"It's ridiculous how much I love the Keurig B70!! I never seemed to be able to make a small pot of consistantly good coffee. I was spending $1.93 every day at Dunkin Donuts. Since my Keurig arrived 3 weeks ago I haven't been to DD once! This coffee maker makes a great cup of piping hot coffee every time in less than a minute. My kids make hot chocolate every morning- no fuss, AND no mess! I use Green Mountain Breakfast Blend K-cups and I my estimate is that each cup costs less than 60 cents. It was worth the $$$! You won't be disappointed!"
2,It was great while it lasted....,"We loved our Keurig brewer for a few months while it worked. But then the problems started, as everyone else stated on this website. We lasted as long as we could, and thinking we may have gotten a lemon, we bought Keurig Brewer #2. More expensive than the first. We figured we'd go much longer with it than the first one (which lasted about 2 years off and on). We were foolish to think this. The Keurig Platinum lasted us less than a year. I de-scaled it until the cows came home, I gave it the ""love tap"" like many suggested, I even removed the bottom of the unit, blew out the air valve, and sealed her back up. To no avail. I will not be buying Keurig #3. Time to move on. It was wonderful and convenient while it lasted. But just too expensive to keep trying to make it work."
2,Died too soon,"I purchased my Keurig 3 years ago as well as one for friends as a gift. Both machines broke within a month of each other with same problem. I am so incredibly disappointed. I loved this machine! It is great while it lasts. But beware, it is not built to last long term. Like other reviewers mentioned, Keurig offered to sell me another at $79. My friend I gave it to was much luckier; they actually replaced hers even though it was out of warranty."
2,The Keurig B70 is a Vibration Machine!,"First off, the Keurig B70 makes great coffee. And the K cup system is great.However, this B70 sounds and feels like it's grinding coffee. Every time one brews a cup of coffee, the machine vibrates before and after the cup is filled. If I leave a spoon on the drip plate, it will vibrate off. I've tried placing the B70 on various vibration absorbing materials, but it doesn't help. I've spoke with Keurig customer service twice, and they tell me this vibration is normal for the B70. I wish I could have seen it in action prior to purchase."
1,Keurig Brewing System coffee is weak,"I had owned a Senseo single cup coffee machine and had read so much about the keurig that I decided to take the plunge and get the top of the line B70 with which you can be the individual filter cup to use your own coffee. Well, I finished up my Senseo pods 2 days ago, and put the machine to sleep momentarily. I opened my Keurig and filter. I have made two cups of coffee with my own Starbucks coffee and both were very weak. I filled the filter cup with Decaf Expresso recommended by the manager at the Starbucks store which is bold, and I like a substantial cup of coffee, so I chose the default mug size and it was watery. Then I tried the next to largest size and it was colored water. I thought the machine had a brewing choice, but obviously not. What a waste of money. I hope Keurig takes it back, as I am going back to my Senseo."
5,"Move over Star Bucks, there's a new star in town!","Simply wonderful. This machine is terrific and brews heavenly coffee. It comes with a small assortment of coffees and a tea sample. All of them are terrific. We bought a couple of additional items, one is the little K-cup that lets you use your own gourmet coffee. I like some of the coffees sold in our local grocery, so this is essential. We also got a 50 pack of the Coffee People Donut coffee. Oh my. It's like going to Dunkin' Donuts. Awesome. We love our new Keurig. If you don't ever drink iced coffee or don't need a travel mug sized portion, you can save $30 and get the B-60. We wanted the full versatility of the B-70."
3,WHEN it works...,"This product is amazing...WHEN it works. This model worked for less than a year before showing signs of breaking down. Once it started, the machine started brewing less than the desired cup size or did not brew at all. It was really hit or miss whether or not the machine would work on any given day. I've descaled, unclogged and only use Brita filtered water. After over a year and a half, my machine has basically stopped working altogether which is a real shame because when it worked, it was an amazing and convenient machine. I loved the quickness of the machine and the variety of K-Cups I could use. I will be investing in a different model the second time around (I have boxes of unused K-cups to use). I've had experienced with the B40 model which heats and brews quicker than than model. Hopefully the problems will not repeat itself..."
2,Wonderful idea but short on delivery,"I bought my Keurig B-70 in Jan of 2010. Within the first week, the water would not refill from the reservoir. The customer service replaced the machine, but the 2nd one failed to refill as well after couple of weeks of use. I am on my 4th machine within the year, but I've learned to make it work by removing the reservoir and slamming it down when it doesn't refill. However, now from time to time, the machine stops making coffee even though it says it is brewing. I love the fresh coffee it makes with every cup, but it isn't without some frustration."
2,Nice....Other than its tendency to break!!!,"We're on our second ""Platinum"" coffee maker. The first stopped brewing after nearly a year. The company was great with a replacement, especially considering we no longer had the receipt. We did, however register the machine after its purchase. Unfortunately, the replacement has failed and apparently in the same manner as the first one. It shows ""Brewing"" but it isn't, and no water will pump. Others have had the same failure on these machines, also. I have a lot of K-Cups laying around, so maybe I'll try another brand. Unfortunately, I've read some of them have ""water pumping"" issues, too. Hard to recommend this product."
4,pretty good,"This works great. I can have my English Breakfast Tea, and the wife her Donut House Coffee in 2 minutes. The travel mug setting won't quite fill a travel mug, so that's the only con I have with this operationally. The other con is that when you order a large variety of the K-cups, they take up a substantial amount of room."
4,Works Great,"The machine is easy to set up, is fully customizable, and is easy to operate. It works great and the reservoir is large enough to not frequent refilling. Two things could be done to improve this product however. These reasons are why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. First, the water filter accessory and filters should be included and not require separate purchaseKeurig Water Filter Replacement Starter Kit. Second, the water only reaches a maximum temperature of 192F. I would like to see it reach 202-204F."
2,"great coffee, disposible machine",The machine makes great coffee and is the perfect concept. I did not buy my original machine from Amazon but I looked here to get a new machine. The one I have seems to have all the same problems addressed in the other reviews. It is very frustrating at 5:00 in the morning and I can't get a cup of coffee. It appears the keurig is a disposable coffeemaker. I think I will go back to my good old reliable Mr. Coffee. Too bad because Keurig is a great concept with terrible engineering.
4,This is the book that started it all,"Anyone who knows anything about cave diving, will know the name ""Sheck Exley"". This little book was the first I know of that documented the absolute ""Must Do's"" for anyone wanting to safely conduct cave diving. Built an Exley's vast and extra-ordinary experience in cave diving. I highly recommend every cave diver have a copy, it's small enough to fit in a dive or travel bag. Although it was first published a while ago, it's still extremely relevant.Stay Safe Everyone"
3,About 15 were unusable (splintered),i guess you get what you pay for. the 50 shims arrived in a vinyl bag and about 15 were splintered. i was trying to use them to get the squeaks out of my kitchen floor by inserting them into the ceiling in the basement. seeing the other reviews i guess i received a bad batch.
3,Nothing Really Significant Here......,"To me this film has nothing REALLY important to say. It doesn't take on any existenial issues or something,in short,it's just pure entertainment. And that's fine with me! I found this film is being truly amusing and very enjoyable. Leaud is perfect in his role. Before you watch this film,keep in mind it is not of the caliber of lets say ""400 blows"" or ""Day for Night"". This is something to watch only if your in the mood for something lighthearted. So sit back and enjoy."
5,one of the greatest films ever,"i wouldn't say that about too many films but this one has it all - romance, humor, sex, etc, etc. It's truffaut's masterpiece so it's a masterpiece by one of the greatest. wow! buy it!"
2,"Painful Alcoholism, Painful Production",Shane wasn't the only one drunk out of his mind. The production of this concert is random and blurry. If you are looking for professional camera work and clear sound--or just something better than an amateur documentation of the Pogues at the most evident start of Shane's downward spiral--do not spend your money on this video. The only thing to remind you that you are watching the Pogues will be the title on the tape case.
3,Gamera vs. Guillon,"Very campy classic. Still a lot of fun. Even though this was a later entry in the series the quality of the production is good. Back in 1969, the steam was running out for the Kaiju genre. Even Toho studios began cutting budgets on thier Godzilla movies. At least this film has mostly original footage, where as the previous entry (Gamera vs. Viras) used lots of old scenes, and even tinted black and white footage from the first Gamera flick. The dubbing of the english language version is terrible. (thanks Sandy) If you ever get a chance to see any of these films with the original sound-track and english subtitles, you'll appreciate them more. It helps to see it widescreen as well. Good old-fashioned fun."
2,Not as good as the video release....,"Darnit, this is just not as good as the video release. The dubbing is actually slightly better, but the unintentional humor factor is now less. Even more unforgivable is the apparent cutting of some of the best kaiju action sequences! Get the ""Gamera Vs. Guiron"" video instead..."
3,Be aware,The reviews here are not for the item being offered/sold. They are for the individual Japanese film of the same title (a Gamera film). That film is NOT in this set. Hope this helps
1,VERY BAD!,gamera returns to fight a shark from outter space in another pitiful entry in the horrorable gamera seris. i enjoyed this more when i saw this on mystery science theater 3000!
1,Gamera vs. the Ginsu Monster,"This flick is among the very worst of Gamera movies. Very simply, Gamera has to save two boys from the clutches of aliens who control Guiron, the monster known for nothing else than having a cheap kitchen knife for a head. DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS FLICK...instead, check out one of the three 1990's Gamera movies. In all honesty."
1,Gamera vs the rubber shark-robot thing! EEEE!,"Did you guys know that Daiei made this movie right before they went bankrupt. Yes, I said bankrupt. And that's no excuse! This is just one BAD movie. Gamera even looks embarrassed to be in it. Zigra is okay, but check out the scene on the end where he falls on his face and the hatch on top of the rubber costume's head pops open! Duh duh duh! It's worse than Megalon!"
3,War on Planet Tere,"In this fith installment, Gamera battles a knife-headeed monster named Gurion on an alien planet called Tere. Meanwhile two sexy aliens have kidnapped two boys and are planning to destroy Earth! Great special effects and campy humor. I say you buy this movie!"
4,Plano Four Handgun Case,"All I can say is WOW! These are some pretty big hangun cases! For the price, these cases will do the trick. Also, keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The hinges are completely plastic so if the cases need to last for a while be sure to take precautions by NOT overloading, stacking, or excessive opening & closing. They will fit 4 semi- autos or 2 large framed revolvers comfortably. I will not advise putting more than two semi-autos on the same level. And, only one large framed revolver on one level because shifting does occur (although minimal) to avoid scratching or scraping metal surfaces. There is a space for a padlock! And, the foam is durable and safe for all handgun finishes. If you need a handgun case for multiple firearms, I recommend this product. If you have a special firearm with lots of accessories or bulky parts, BUY this immediately to keep things in one location and in reach. Overall, I rate this product 4 out of 5!"
3,Cheap but Good,"I use this case to hold fragile astronomy equipment for the trip from the house to the backyard or from the trunk of the car to the observing field. For that purpose, it is suitable and an excellent value. However, a drop from any height may cause the case to spring it's latches or break a hinge. It is not water proof and won't float so don't look to this as a competitor to the higher end Pelican products, etc. It meets my needs without breaking the bank. I also own and use the two pistol version and am equally satisfied with it."
1,You get what you pay for,"I normally don't go discount, but decided to try this case...but its disappointing. The foam compression is such that my Ruger Mark III Competition and my Ed Brown .45 will not stay in place inside the case and move around inside. That makes the case all but worthless as a gun tote to the range. I gave it to my son for his paintball gear and am buying Pelican with plunk n' pick foam instead. This case is very basic, and offers only marginal protection. Skip it if you have nice firearms."
5,Good stuff,"FlAWLESS TRANSACTION, THE ITEM IS PERFECT, THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND IT ARRIVED QUICKLY WITH NO HASSLES. I HAVE TWO PISTOLS, LOADERS, MAGAZINES AND CARTRIDGES, ALONG WITH SOME BASIC TOOLS AND EVERYTHING FITS FINE."
3,pistol case,expected better quality product for the price. could have spent extra $$ for a much better product. instead of using product for my pistols used it as storage case for my cameras. foam inserts were outstanding though.
4,Great storage case,I actually didn't get this for pistols. It works great to store our electronic depth sounder and fish finder with all its cables and attachments.
2,Nice Camera...but it won't talk to my PC,"I purchased this camcorder/digital camera in May 2002 and found that it takes excellent video, is easy to use, and seemed to be a good value. Unfortunately my good first impression came to an end. Despite every trick known to a computer geek and following Panasonic's instructions to the letter, I cannot get the camera to ""talk"" to my PC. Therefore the digital camera function is worthless to me now. Panasonic's product literature states the Windows 95/98/Me/2000 OS is required. I am using Windows XP. So I went to Panasonic's website to download the newest iteration of the software but that didn't solve the problem. I called Panasonic's customer service and despite numerous busy signals, finally reached a rep who was basically clueless. It might be the cable, but I don't want to buy a new one. I'd really like Panasonic to solve the problem!"
4,Panasonic PV-L452 Camcorder,"I really like this camcorder, easy to use...nice picture. Instructions are a little hard to follow for a first time user, but once you get used to it, it is great."
2,No fi,"Interesting collection of music, but the fidelity is really terrible. I am not sure if it could be remastered, but the way it sounds now is disappointing. If you are not interested if hi-fi sound and you love Krupa, then you will be satisfied since there are lots of drum pieces in the recording."
2,The precision system of contract bridge bidding,I have been using this system of bidding for ten years. I have played with a foursome using this system for these ten years. We have entered some local duplicate tournements and have never finished worse than second. The local directors do not like us to use Precision bidding and have tried to outlaw it or prevent us from playing.
3,3.50 rating: A new age perspective/primer for weddings....,"I didn't love this book but then again I didn't hate it either. I'm just not into the whole ""goddess"" concept. I tend to be of the belief that a bride is no better or special than any other woman out there. This book had a lot of great ideas for individuals who are looking to incorporate cultural traditions into their wedding ceremony. I would probably buy this book if I were looking to have something along those lines. The book has a very spiritual air to it and the section on vows is well written."
3,Beginner level in the series,I first got NO.4 in the series and liked the album a lot. Then I got this first one which turned out to be a dissapointment. The style is different and vocals are used in many of the songs in this album. But it is simply not as enjoyable as 4. I suspect the music gets better as the series goes.
3,Don't use with Asus A8N,"I was about to buy this based on the recommendation from silent pc review, but then I read some posts on their forum. It looks like this power supply won't boot up an Asus A8N. I gave it 3 stars because it's supposed to be quiet; however, if I had one that didn't work with my motherboard I would drop it down to 1 star."
2,Racehorse or Cockatiel,"I bought this book and then returned it -- I was not impressed. It did not tell me what to do when my bird laid an egg (eat it I presume!). That was the main reason for my purchase.It has a large chapter on the cost of owning a cockatiel. I may not be wealthy, but even I know that its not a ****ing racehorse -- how much can it cost? What a waste of print.Can anybody suggest a better book?"
5,Awesome,I read this before in the late 80`s it was great then and is even better the second time around. I only wish the ending was a little different. Picano`s best by far....it makes you not stop reading.
5,Pop Masterpiece ( Fantástico Pop ),"Simplemente un maestro del Pop en castellano . Desde No me iré Mañana ( 91 ) , no deja de sorprenderme su facilidad para escribir , componer , arreglar , tocar y cantar sus canciones . Simples y al punto . Tengo todos sus Grabaciones y me sigue Encantando su Pop Puro y Fresco . Océano de Sol sigue siendo mi favorito ."
5,A coffee table book that could BE the coffee table!,Great book with great color photos. Very detailed information and maps. Care information. An all round good reference....the only knock being...it's a little too large.....but not a bad price/value for it's size on the other hand. If you are interesting in keeping PDF's then this is a must have...a wealth of information!
4,WELL MADE SEQUEL,"I gave this movie four stars out of five for one reason - Richard Dreyfus is not in it. Apparently after he received his oscar in 1977, he felt he should get more money for doing the sequel. This movie is different from the first. It does not take place in one night but on New Years Eve in four years (1964, 1965, 1966 & 1967). Director B.W.L. Norton wrote the screenplay, expanding it from the George Lucas's epilogue at the end of the first film. The film is dramatic, funny and depressing. That was indeed the 60's! The music selected for the film includes Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Aretha Franklin and the Doors. It is DIFFERENT from the first one but SEQUELS should be DIFFERENT. I'm hoping that Universal will release the movie on DVD soon and in the WIDESCREEN format too! The film was shot in Cinemascope (2.35:1) and flat four (1.85:1) aspect ratios as well as 16mm for the Vietnam war scenes."
4,Both on one disk...for a great price,"Only one disk in this ""set"" but both movies so close at hand can not be beat for the price. Buy this set to play over and over, find a better set if you want ""collection quality""."
5,Sleeper.,"a real Sleeper..)one of the best Vietnam sequences in movie history.. a montage of the ensemble cast.. one of my favorite all time movies.. the fact that it routinely gets panned, makes all the better.. Zoey Deschanel's father was cinemotagrapher, coming out of Zoetrope.. i think the entire movie was filmed in California, but the vietnam sequences are so authentic, u'd think otherwise.. must have been filmed in the wetlands and rice fields south of sacremento.. my best guess.."
3,Poor packaging/incomplete data,"My problem is not with the transmitters themselves but rather with the way they were packaged and shipped. This device includes, in addition to the unique code label on the device itself, a facility code of an additional 2 digits which provides further security (additional uniqueness of code). This additonal code was not supplied with the device. The manufacturer normally sells these in blocks of ten (I ordered ten) which are consecutive code numbers with the facility code labeled on the outer package. The entry system is programmed to be able to enter these codes in blocks rather than each individually. I received 10 randomly coded devices thrown in a box without any packing or identification of the facility code. As I chose to keep them rather than return I have limited reason to complain I suppose. Other than the foregoing the transmitters work fine."
1,Sorry but it did not work,I was so disappointed when I got these. They did not work on my garage door opener . I had to return them and I am waiting for my refund.I hope it gets here soon as it was over $50.00.I could really use that right now.I am sad that the openers did not work.
4,Works perfectly.,"Works perfectly with my Linear garage opener. It paired instantly and works great. The range isn't great, but it's fine when you're close enough."
5,Works great,I bought this becasue my opener wasn't working well and thought this would be small and easy to use. It was easy to program and works very well.
5,...better than the original,Our original garage door opener is bulky and hard to find a place for it in our cars. This one hangs on the keychain and is much less intrusive. What's more! It was easily programmed.
5,Most Bang for Your Buck,"When I first recieved this particular product I have to admit i was skeptical. I had only bought this product because I was in charge of taping some scenes from a play. But, after using this product I would say that it has the most features and the easiest to use system you will find for anywhere near [item price]! It easy to use, sleek, hideaway LCD screen lets you see exactly what you are taping. It also lets you watch what you taped without having to go to a TV. Overall, what this procuct has to offer is far superior to some of its competitors."
3,okay Good library Book to check out,I would personally not purchase this book again - your better off checking this one out from your local library
5,The best songs in the world!,"This is the best music I have ever heard in my life!! My favorite song is definantly ""The Island Road"". David Arkenstone, your the best!!"
4,Almost as good as the first,"I remember my friend and I playing rampage on the n64 (he has it) but then we went to rent a game and we rented rampage 2. so we played it and noticed that there are different monsters now and you have to unlock the original 3. We couldnt save the game (my guess was he didnt have a memory card for his n64) and it was just like the first game but graphics were better and other stuff i dont remember (we played this like, 3 years ago) and i was the rat and he was the rhino. around level 20 we both got GAME OVER!? In the first rampage for the n64, there was no game over (unless you7 quit) but hey, atleast this had bonus levels too. later i got rampage world tour (the first one) and played it with my friends and i beat it like twice. get the first one instead....Then go for this one because the first will get boring over time."
3,Rampaging chicago over and over.,"Although much better than the first Rampage,its still the the same it gets so boring after awile that if you beat the game [all 150 levels] you won't want to go near the game for another month.this game does have new characters,Ruby-a giant lobster,Boris a huge rhino,and Curtis-a enourmos mouse.you can also be the original characters,George,Lizzie,and Ralph.There's also some secret characters,Mycus,Big AL,and nuebus,theyall have the same body,a froglike body with one,but there all different colors.after you rescue the three original charaters aliens come take over the world and since your destroying the world you might as well destroy them too.then after you ''save the world'' tou go into outer space and destoy the towns on all the planets you finally beet the game.My suggesting is that you get a memory pak and do about 10-20 levels a day so you don't die of boardness"
5,Improvisation at its Best,"`Live at the Quick' is a snapshot taken of a band with all pistons firing. While most people wouldn't necessarily think of a banjo as an explosive instrument, Bela Fleck makes it so. Of course, he can also make it sound so delicate that you think it might just collapse in his hands. The same can be said for the virtuoso bass playing of Victor Wooten, quite possibly the most gifted musician I have ever heard play live (Fleck is another contender). This is a terrific addition to any music collection, particularly if you are interested in improvisation and modern variations on traditional music."
5,Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Power Source...,"Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Power Source is good for light duty jobs, such as camping or fishing trips when you just need a little bit of power to get you through the day."
3,Purchase of Xantrex Powerpack 600,"I thought I had purchased the Xantrex Power pack as advertised on the Amazon web site. I received the Durecell 600hd ""Obviously the same product"" but was charged $50 more and the product was cracked mid way down the jumper all the way from one end to the other.I returned it and let them know my discust....."
2,Super Saver Shipping not available,"The item indicates free shipping but when you try to check out, that option is not available and attempts to charge 55 dollars (Alaska).So don't use one click checkout unless you don't mind paying shipping."
1,Great begining but.... have to agree waste of money and time,"Bought this for the occasional power cut and for the hurricane season. Worked well initially but the ac adapter failed within one month. It was replaced under the warranty but the second ac adapter has also failed. This units is just not the quality I was expecting..huge disappointment.Gave in and bought another Ac adapter outside the warranty period so ended up throwing good money after bad, since the item lit up and appeared to be charging, but still will not work after 24 hours of charging!!! No more Xantrex for me......"
4,Good action movie,"This movie has plenty of guns and fight scenes, and the simple fact that Bolo Yeung playes a bad guy in it gives it a few extra points."
4,Not bad...but certainly not the best.,"Vandamme, is up there with Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal and a few others. This is not one of his best movies(See Hard Target or Universal Soldier). But it is enjoyable non-the-less. He plays two brothers which were separated at six months of age only to re-unite 25 years later as total opposits. One, a gruffy street-smart semi-thug, the other a ladies man martial arts instructor. The difference in the characters are vast and comical.If you have never seen a Van-damme film, don't start with this one, if you are, then enjoy."
2,Cool Film!!!,"This film is a true classic. Story is a bit slow, I kinda did't like it to much. The film was almost like his other 80's film but still I thought it was more like a ""Ladys soap opera"". It Some what has some awesome action in the movie.This is one of those films that if there is nothing else to watch on tv then you can pop this DVD in and kill some time with it."
4,Wonderful book,"This book is great not only for papers and reports on Russia's Revolutions, but also for readers simply interested in the story of the Bolsheviki. It reads like a great novel, and there are plenty of helpful notes and explanations to help the less knowledgeable reader with this topic in history. Reed shows a lot from the point of view of the Bolsheviki. A very fascinating twist that sets it apart from other books on the subject. First-hand experience gives Reed great subject matter and accuracy. Pick this one up!"
3,"Hard to read, but informative.","I only read this again (first time in college) because I am going to St. Petersburg later this year and I wanted to remember the story of the Russian Revolution which took place there. I don't think I ever finished it in college and I had a hard time this time, because it is full of confusing Russian names and places and the narrative is not always sequential. Like Russian politics, it is almost indecipherable, but interesting and historical."
5,Nibbly The Bunny,This is a great little toy for little ones to relate to. Just the right size for those little hands.
5,Nothing Fishy Here....,"Well, there is, in the form of several stories of fact and fiction that center around the Fulton Fish Market, and just about all of them are enjoyable. I'll say one thing. If, after reading Up In The Old Hotel, you don't know how to trawl for fish then you didn't really read this book. All in all, over 700 pages of unique character studies. Mitchell seemed to find someone interesting where no one else cared to look. I fully intend to buy more Mitchell."
5,The Best,"You don't have to be of a certain age or from a certain time or place to appreciate Joseph Mitchell. He transports you. He sees things the rest of us miss, or if we notice them at all, he sees in them things we don't. He takes us places unknown, and disappearing, as Charles Kuralt did in ""On the Road."" What he writes is literature. You can recognize that, even if what he writes or how he writes it doesn't particularly appeal to you. It DOES appeal to me! He could make a grocery list a rewarding read. If I had to be marooned on a desert island with one book, this would be the one. I write this on the occasion of buying yet another copy to give as a gift (to the surgeon who commented knowledgeably when he found me reading the Memoirs of U.S. Grant). If there were room to store them I'd buy a googolplex, not to run out if it goes out of print again."
3,This book is overrated,"The ideas Hilary Mantel deal with in this book are interesting and I enjoyed her depiction of 17th c. London. However, in spite of her beautiful writing, I found that none of the characters engaged me and the lack of any dramatic tension or plot was a bit annoying."
1,Lacking Description,At first when I received this product I felt kind of stupid for buying something that only worked with a bike rack. Then I went back to the item page and realized that NOWHERE does it specify that the fender only works with Topeak racks.
2,What a surprise,"I read, TommyKnockers, Thinner, Talisman (my favorite), and others by Stephen King I dont remember right now. I was expecting alot from this book. This book was nothing compared to his previous work I read. I found it boring, and confusing, some parts were not detailed enough, and why did he have to go describe exactly what EVERYBODY is thinking? Some of the characters were typical,and predictable. Most of all, I hate books that seem like they could become cheesy ""made for tv"" movies."
5,Stephen King is back,"It's nice to see Mr. King return to his roots. This novel was every bit as good as his earlier books. I found his charactes plausible, his storyline riveting and the conclusion weird but fasinating. Would highly recommend the book to anyone who like me who liked the earlier King novels."
1,Stephen King uses the F-word more than Ozzie and fam.,"I have read all of Stephen King's books, both fiction and non-fiction, and was very disappointed with ""Dreamcatcher"". I think the story was more of a psychosomatic vomiting relating to King's recent accident and sounded rather morphine tainted. It was like a fruit salad (parts and pieces) of his other stories and lacked it's ability to stand on it's own. Sometimes less is better, and even though I love a long read, ""Dreamcatcher"" needed to be downsized and rehabed into something a little clearer and crisper.Why have all of Stephen's books gotten progressively more infected with profanity? I'm not a prude, but knowing a million ways to rhyme the f-word and other crude language really doesn't captivate me. Like the ""Byrus"", this ran amuck."
4,Definitely memorable...will read again,"Like most of Stephen King's work, DreamCatcher is a very original story that is hard to forget once you have finished. There are certain parts of the story that jump out and grab you. Stephen King has said in many ways,Dreamcatcher is a mean book. He's right...DreamCatcher goes for the jugular and doesnt hold back. Hands down, Dreamcatcher is flat out GROSS. This was one of those stories that made me feel sick and uncomfortable. Translation, Stephen King Delivers the Goods! Great bleak story from King Writimus Maximus. Enjoy!"
2,Not his best at all!,"I have read every Stephen King book ever written and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. Well, what a let down this was. Dreamcatcher was not a good book in my opinion. The start was great but after a while you get the feeling the author was just making it drag out to get the 600 words. This story could have been done in 300 words, it would have been better. All up I was seriously disappointed. The story line was totally unbelievable and way too far fetched. I didn't like it and would not recommend this book. It wasn't in the slightest bit scary. Disappointing!!"
3,Stephen King Lite,"Dreamcatcher throws in most of the elements familiar to King fans(some setting and themes from It, government paranoia first groomed in Firestarter, and characterizations well-oiled from all the previous King novels) and somehow gets the formula wrong this time. The first half shows some promise, despite the over use of gross out over suspense as a way to hook the reader, but then the whole novel deteriorates into a very long chase sequence with little surprise or heft. There are some very clever ideas about memory and childhood stuck in along the way and the time spent inside the mind of one of the characters is time well spent but these interesting bits are plugged into a story that should have been better. The novel does its best to create proverbial mountians out of molehills but never quite succeeds."
2,My first disappointment...,Sometimes it happens even to the #1 fan...It looks like king was trying to write a long episode of x files.And not quite comprehansive one.The story lose momentum as you past the first 60 pages. Even the attempt to tie the character with the dream catcher faild.Is this the same author of the stand and IT ?Does King become soft after the near death experience he had (i hope not)
4,How important are your childhood memories?,I loved what King did with the 4 boys' character study & duddits. It was great how he tied their life stories together through childhood and adulthood. You need to read this or you will be missing a treat.
2,Is it just me?,"I have read almost all of Mr. King's novels and liked most of them, but this one seems a little splattered. The premise, aliens in New England, seems interesting enough, but somewhere along the way, I kept losing interest, skipping ahead pages and not really caring what happened to most of the characters. I don't think this one is up the standard I associate with Steven King novels."
2,A story that wasn't for me,"I consider myself a big King fan however this I will erase from my memory. I did find some parts of the book interested like the relationship of the friends, how they cared for Dudits and how they had all been friends for years. I loved the story until the guy with bad farts came along. I am not into aliens and do not find story lines along that nature very exciting but I thought King would pull it off. To me, it was just like any other Alien story... a bit more creative and gross but not anything I wanted to read. I didn't even finish the book because it was getting too ridiculous."
4,dreamcatcher,This book is about four boys that have been friends since their childhood days. They acquired some special powers from a reterded boy called Duddits. Duddits is really an alien and he knew that an alien invasion was coming which is why he was preapring the boys for it.Twenty-five years later it becomes a battle to save the world. Fans of horror will not be disappointed.
2,A let down,"Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King. I own most of his stuff and have been working on reading everything of his for years now. But this one just doesn't cut it for me. It's boring and hard to follow compared with his other stuff. If you've never read King before and are trying to pick a book of his to start out with, avoid this one. He has plenty of others that will blow your mind."
2,Dreamcatcher is better than Unisom!,"First, I'm a hardcore Stephen King fan. The man is a great writer on many levels, especially his hurmor and sense of irony. But, this one doesn't make it. I think King is trying too hard to work through his emotions since he was hit by a van, and I understand that. However, in so doing he's created a story that is so jumbled it's hard to follow. And what's worse, it's hard to care about any of the characters. The story is all over the place, and one of the characters even has a near fatal run-in with a car. Plus, the four main characters, men who were friends since childhood, are too much like the kids in ""Stand By Me."" I hope Mr. King can come to grips with his ordeal, and I wish him well."
2,Don't waste your time,"I thought it would be nice to read the book before going to see the movie. However, after reading the book, I do not want to see the movie at all. There are a lot of cheap thrills in the book...the play on bodily functions, while funny, is dull after awhile. Duddit's cancer and Down's Syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic, like the book is trying too hard. Plus, by page 200, I cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book. Nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative. The emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring. Although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end, I feel like I wasted a lot of time reading all 600+ pages of it when I finished it. If you are a Stephen King fan, this may satisfy you. However, if you are not a fan, don't bother."
1,Makes Tommyknockers look like genius,"I never thought I would say this, but this makes 'The Tommyknockers' look like a really excellent book... this is not up to par with King's recent offerings such as 'Bag of Bones' and 'Hearts in Atlantis.' King goes for the the gross-out in this book, and leaves the reader cringing with graphic images of various bodily functions. I am a big King fan, but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book."
2,"Not worth ""Catching""","Anything the guy writes appeals to me but this one just didn't seem to hold together. A lot of good ideas but none explored or exploited the way it could have been. Really a mish-mash in which King, himself, doesn't seem to know where the story is headed or why. Could have used a good editor, too.Black House is, so far, much more enjoyable but gosh, do I miss the King-days of ""The Shining"", ""Dead Zone"", etc., etc."
2,His Worst,Characters- one dimensional. Couldn't identify with any.Story- Kind of silly.Execution- Overlong and overblown.Readability- Very confusing at times. Flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks.
4,A let down for the gore-hungry; GREAT for us faint-hearted!,"I absolutley adore Stephen King, but can't read ALL of his work for fear of the ensuing nightmares! I found this novel to be a home-run... not so overwhelming that I couldn't sleep at night, but definitely kept me interested--despite the fact that I usually HATE the subject matter."
3,Those pesky aliens,"I've read many of the other reviews and to sum it up: Mr. King, please stop writing about aliens. I've read all his books and most of his published short stories. There is no better author than Stephen King as far as I'm concerned. I'm a true fan. But there have only been two books of his I did not care for and it was this one and the dreadful TOMMYKNOCKERS. His characters are always so rich in background but DREAMCATCHER had me confused and bored. All I can say is that I am waiting impatiently for the follow-up to THE TALISMAN."
2,Capable of doing better!,"Stephen King is one of my top five favorite contemporary writers (along with John Irving, Richard Russo, Neil Gaiman, and Bruce Alexander, in case you're interested.) However, Dreamcatcher is one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. There are traces of the things that have made me a devoted SK reader, but they are scarce. Perhaps the best part of the novel is the character Duddits and the role he plays. A major weakness is the impression that much of the novel seemed to be written with Hollywood in mind. And while we have all reluctantly learned to expect grossness in SK novels, Dreamcatcher carries it to new extremes, and seriously hindered my ability to enjoy the novel. Don't expect anything approaching the greatness of The Stand or It or The Dark Tower series."
2,One of my least favorite King books,"I guess I am one of the minority of those who reviewed this book, but I didn't care for it at all. I have been reading King for 20 years, and while I have my favorites (The Stand, Christine, Pet Sematary) I have never before disliked one of his books. I was very disappointed in this effort by him. Hopefully his next book will be more like the King we know and love."
1,How disappointing!!,"I was so looking forward to this book because everyone blurp I'd read had me thinking that the characters in this book were the same as the heroes in ""It"". Beware! They are not!! As much as I love Stephen King, this book is tedious, long, and rambling. I think I'll go re-read ""The Stand""..."
3,Slogging through,"I started this book with great anticipation, however I have found it difficult to finish the last third of this book. I think he could have written the same piece more effectively if 1/2 of it was taken out! It started out with a bag, but then somehow lost it's steam."
1,awful..just awful,"I looked forward to this book like crazy. It got off to a slow start then picked up and then it went right down hill again. I kept speed reading through some of the pages-something you should never do-but it was so bad. Boring, badly written and it could have been told in about 300 less pages. I bought it as i have all of SK's books and will continue to buy them, sometimes he can suprise you. but let this one rot on the bookshelves. it will never go out of print, i mean Geralds Game is stll around (what a howler that one was). Stay away it's as bad as The Tommy Knockers. Yeck!!"
1,BORING BOOK,"I have in the past enjoyed King's books however, the Dreamcatcherjumped around to much, in fact in places it just rambled on as ifKing just wanted to fill up the pages with words. I read the first400 pages hoping it would get better, it did not. Graham Mastertonis still the best."
2,Dustcatcher,"All of King's books have found a home in my personal library, but ""Dreamcatcher"" has been collecting dust. Has taken months to force myself through 354 pages. Every time I open the book it's as though I'm overcome by a case of attention-deficit-disorder. However, having read a few glowing reviews offered in this venue, I will continue the read, searching for a bit of the magic that has made Mr. King a master storyteller."
4,"WELCOME BACK, STEVE","I've read the majority of Mr. King's books and have always enjoyed his page-turning style even when the story itself did not seem up-to-par. ""Dreamcatcher"" really kept my interest up for the full length and it is great to see Mr. King still able to write with his famous vigor after the terrible accident. One thing I really liked about ""Dreamcatcher"" was the ending. I have sometimes felt disappointed with Stephen's endings that often show the evil losing to the story's hero(es), but hinting that the evil has actually survived and moved on. Geez, my tongue itches."
4,I decided to love it,"I love stephen king. i have always tended to become very involved in his stories, i.e. stay up until the wee hours of the morning just to finish one more page........ anyway, for a while there i was starting to notice a big change in his writing, the way he depicted his characters, etc. i was disappointed to say the least because that was what drew me to his books. But i have found with dreamcatcher, the same old king i used to know. Dreamcatcher reminded me a lot of IT. I enjoyed it and I am glad i bought it. I may even listen to it again, all 20 cd's."
4,Not quite a classic,"See storyline summary above.When I started reading this novel I thought I was in for a treat. It started out with all the classic Stephen King elements. As I progressed with the novel I began to change my mind. For one thing I think it was to long. Normally, as with classic King, the longer the better, but this story seemed to drag a bit at times. At times it also becomese a little confusing as to the perspective of the narrative. Such as when, where and who this perspective is coming from. An enjoyable novel overall for the true Stephen King fan and it's better than a couple of his previous novels, but it just isn't comparable to 'The Stand' or 'It'.Recommended for Stephen King fans."
5,Didn't want to put it down.,No-it was not particularly scary. No-it didn't keep me up at night. Yes-it was riveting and interesting. The friendship of all of these 5 men was beautifully written and the characters were memorable. I really enjoyed this. I also enjoyed that fact that King didn't go off on any tangents in this book as he seems to do in some of his others. Very good tale.
1,I left it in the hotel...,"Stephen King's use of obscenities has become more pronounced with each succeeding novel...the last one I really enjoyed was The Stand. After wading through about a third of Dreamcatcher, I left the book in my hotel room when I checked out; page after page of disgusting obscenities were more than I could take."
3,A good effort,"Dreamcatcher is a good effort by King, but its not a great book. But before I get to my issues with it I want to say that Dreamcatcher has a lot of things going for it. The characters are interesting, the plot moves at its own steady rate, and I really liked how the military was involved.However, Dreamcatcher is a unnecessarily lengthy book, and even though it develops its characters that doesn't justify the books length. In all honestly I got sick of it around the 400 page mark and literally skipped 200 pages, and I didn't really miss a single thing. (And I don't typically skip pages in books, I read Under the Dome without skipping a single page)Aside from the books length though I don't really have too many qualms with Dreamcatcher, and its not one of his worst books or anything its just not as good as his others. It started well, but it slowly went downhill."
4,Benn awhile....,"I thought this was very remenisent of old stephen king, it was a good read for a long car ride, I just hate that the most likeable characters are the ones who croak, but it was still a good book."
5,I loved Dreamcatcher... it was unique,"Stephen King - just so damn good. Even though my bookshelf is full of new-age authors like Starhawk and old classics like Orwell and Huxley - Stephen King's books, old and new, just blow me away.Dreamcatcher is great. Totally new themes and a real 2000-esqueness. UFO's, secret military campaigns, alien implants... sounds like SK has been listening to Art Bell or something.Don't listen to reviewers complaining of recycled plots. This book is a totally new experience. And it's a white-knuckle roller-coaster ride all the way.p.s. Hats off to Duddsie"
2,These chicks rock!,"Long before it was fashionable, this all-sister New England garage band produced and released their own brand of Do-It-Yourself indie rock. They didn't let anything stand in their way. Little details like meter and tuning never deterred them from getting their message across. Includes the outsider anthem ""My Pal Foot-Foot""."
5,u*N*i*Q*u*E,"I can virtually guarantee that you have never heard an album like this one-- it is rather indefinable, somewhat like this drawing on the cover. The off-kilter harmonies have a special beauty all their own, while the drummer is truly marching to a different beat. The lyrics reach levels of banality seldom heard or equalled until recently. The spiritual ancestors of Wilson-Phillips. Worth owning just to see jaws dropping at the utter unbelievability of it all. Rate it either 5 stars or 1 star depending on your tolerance."
1,truly truly awful....,"if pre-fab singers like britney spears, mariah carey and the backstreet boys were thrown in a studio and given a bunch of instruments and told to record, the end result would sound something like this."
1,A waste of money! No musical value at all.,I heard about this and had to have it. It was the worst CD I have ever lisitened to. Sounds a lot like little kids banging on pots and pans in the kitchen. Don't waste your money! someone is making a lot of money on this crap cd. I resold it on ebay about 10 seconds after I played it.
1,the shaggs,This is like hearing children play music for the first time. This is talentless on many levels. waste your money if you must.
3,America the Beautiful,"I only have a few questions/comments to make everyone think:How does somone,of any race or color, make over $500K a year w/out knowledge by his/her superiors of the methods used?How does this go on for 3-4 yrs, especially when he is using the company's money to make money? (8 million is lot not to ask...""What the hell is going on here?""Is there an example of any other corporation that has been shutdown by one person's action?What's wrong w/all y'all former Kidder employees? Let's all look at the facts....There are some really foul things going on in this world."
1,"""RED LIGHT SPECIAL, ISLE 5""","UGH ! ONE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT JETT AND HIS APOLOGISTS FADE AWAY AND LEAVE US ALL ALONE. IF PEOPLE KNEW THE TRUE DECEPTION PERPETRATED BY JETT AT KIDDER PEABODY, THEY WOULD FIND NO SYMPATHY FOR THIS CRIMINAL !"
3,I admit some of it is funny...........,"I admit some of this is funny but I was very spoiled by their first effort and Big Bambu. If you listen to those two albums before hearing this you get that some of Los Cochinos is sequel which some of the Big Bambu is to the first effort. Guess I had grown weary of the rehash.For some reason I didnt think basketball jones was funny. And the sister Mary Elephant trying to calm the class down was way overblown with students yelling in the background just to be yelling...........not so funny either.I highly recommend the first two albums if you have not heard them........very funny and breakout material at the time, which may be the other reason for me giving three stars, Cheech and Chong were by now very well known and commercial at the time this album was released."
1,Pinches my fingers,"This is not well made. The whole function is to squeeze it open, but when you do, the exposed hinges pinch your fingers. It is also very stiff. I threw it out. Save your money."
3,Too costly,"I was duped into paying $4 S&H plus $4 for the purse, thus too costly. It works okay but I've had better ones for less than a dollar."
2,broke,"It looked like a good idea, but it broke soon after using it. There is a real need for a place for men to put their change!"
2,"Great sound, shame about the music","Absolutely spectacular sound, - the cello has warmth and bit and at times the timpani make you want to jump out of your seat. Having said that, thats all there is. The music is bloated, dull, repetitive and uninteresting. Either full of sound and fury, signifying nothing or else moodily quite in pseudo-profound style but signifying just as little. A sonic spectacular, but only if you arent interested in (the) music."
2,very dissapointing,"I was captivated by the story of Rebecca by this author, and looked forward to reading this book, however I was bitterly dissapointed.The storyline was badly drawn and the ending was a complete surprise. I felt there should have been another chapter when the story finally made sense."
3,And Don't Forget the Cheesecake,"Not quite a ""must read"" for deli lovers and lovers of New York City, but close...Anyone who has ever eaten at the Carnegie Deli will appreciate this book which gives a good history of one of New York's most legendary delis, and explains how and why those great big--and wasteful--sandwiches came to be.Lots of interesting information here, but, in the end, it reads as if it were written primarily to sell as a ""souvenir"" of eating at the Carnegie.Would be interesting to know if the book is sold at the Deli cash register and, if so, how many have been sold there...And one should note that there is a coupon for a free piece of the Carnegie's New York Style Cheescake in the back. With New York prices, that alone could offset the cost of the book.Go for it--the book and the cheesecake."
4,I think Karloff makes a pretty good performance as Imhotep.,"This was not one of the best Universal monster flims I have seen. Boris Karloff's mummy is unlike the mummy that we know. The Mummy was one of the earliest Universal classic monster films ever made. It is an interesting film, but you have to watch this film a few times so you could totally understand it. However, Karloff is my favorite actor. I always like to see him star as the Frankenstein monster."
5,THIS IS THE ONLY MUMMY FILM WHICH WILL LAST FOREVER! A++++++,BY FAR UNIVERSALS GREATEST HORROR FILM! THE BEST MUSICAL SCORE OF ALL THEIR MOVIES! THE MUMMY/ARDETH BAY MAKEUP THOUGH DONE IN 1932 IS STILL AMAZING TODAY! THIS WAS MAKE-UP ARTIST JACK PIERCES GREATEST CREATION! BORIS KARLOFF GIVES HIS GREATEST AND MOST NUANCED PERFOMANCE! THIS MOVIE HAS AMAZING EGYPTIAN SET DESIGN BEAUTIFULLY RENDERED! THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST ATMOSPHERIC AND DREAM-LIKE FILM MADE IN ANY GENRE! THIS MOVIE IS MORE OF A CREEPY GOTHIC ROMANCE THAN A SHEER HORROR FILM. NEVERTHELESS THE OPENING SCENE IN WHICH KARLOFFS MUMMY IS BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE IS TERRIFYING! THIS IS THE CLOSEST A FILM AS EVER COME TO POETRY! THE DVD IS EXCELLENT WITH A PRISTINE PICTURE TRANSFER! AND GREAT MENU ARTWORK! NOT TO MENTION LOTS OF GREAT EXTRAS! WATCH THIS FILM ALONE IN THE DARK AFTER MIDNIGHT FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT! ALL OTHER MUMMY MOVIES ARE FORGETTABLE B MOVIE TRASH IN COMPARISON!
4,Karloff was spectacular,"I have to admit, I saw the 1999 version first, which I did not think was bad. It wasnt until recently that I saw this earlier film along with several other Universal horror classics. First I would like to say that to compare this version with the 1999 version is a mistake, I have seen several remakes of old movies in the last ten years and it seems to me that they should not be compared on the same scale, even when it is a rehash of the same story. I thought Karloff did a wonderful job on this picture. It was a good idea not having him walk around in bandages the whole time and this one was certainly superior to the many sequels that followed it. Not as much of a favorite to me as Dracula or bride of Frankenstein, but then I'm more of a Lugosi Fan than a Karloff one, but nonetheless. This is a must see for anyone interested in classic universal horror. I cant wait to receive it on DVD."
3,"Not a bad story, decent read.","Not a bad book. The story is entertaining, by no means does it keep you on the edge of your seat. Rated three stars since it is average reading, don't get me wrong I did enjoy the book."
5,Gods Perfect Word,Gods word is perfect in every way. I cannot add to perfect so read it for yourself. It will be the best decision of your life.
4,great book,"I loved this book - it's SO nice to have a great women's fiction choice where the main character is over 35 and not 26 and dying to get married- -and really is starting over, has real problems, hang ups,etc. Great read. well written too~"
2,Somebody to love,"I began to watch the movie and could not finish it. Others liked it, to me it was perhaps too skiddish-road with people falling to the low passions of their soul just to cruise through life and/or to accomplish an unvirtious end; I'm not really that sanctimonious, I have managed to watch more horrible films to the end. For some reason this one never got off the ground, some day I'll watch the rest of it and perhaps then I'll submit an ammended review."
4,Assasin,Another example of a good Japanese samuri film. This film quietly rolls along picking up speed and delivers the goods. Makes you laugh and smile at times.
1,boring,It's terribly boring. period.This DVD makes me fall asleep very easily.Too many interviews and the video quality is really bad.
4,nice concealer,"i use this as a concealer, it says highlighter but I wonder if that's the same as concealing. Well, it's very nice, slim design, and I like the fact that I only pump out the amount I need. mess free!"
5,An icon,"This product is amazing. I read a lot of fashion magazines and all the celebrities raving about this product. This is really great product. It's mainly used as a highlighter, that's how YSL advertises it. This product is not gonna make you happy if you are looking for a concealer, but great if you are looking to highlight certain parts of your face."
2,Not my favorite,"As the story progressed it got better, but I felt as though the writing style for this book lacked something. Perhaps a younger reader may have enjoyed it more, though I found myself getting lost several times trying to keep straight who was who. Names of characters hard to pronounce as well. I found the it hard to lose myself in the world she was trying to create because their were too many unanswered questions and bad explanations for things."
1,You get what you pay for,"This book is horrible. It drags out info that could be said in ten pages and attempts to make it a book. Boring, monotonous, tedious, and beats the reader over the head with Christian morality and scriptures."
2,"Too fast, too sloppy","I bought this video based on the rave reviews it has received. I have the Kathy Smith and Billy Blanks kickboxing videos, and was looking to vary the routine. The first part of the video seemed great, with easy to follow demonstrations, and a killer buns/thighs floor workout. However, the rest of the video was disappointing. After all the talk about ""go at your own pace,"" I thought the floor exercises went much too fast. During the standing portion of the workout, Grogran loses count on every section, and the music beats don't match the workout counts. This may not be a big deal for some, but I found it very distracting. I am used to instructors that are conscientious about working both sides of the body evenly. As to the ""fun"" factor: Grogan kept telling me to have fun, but I didn't, not even after the fiftieth time he told me to! I can only recommend the buns/thigh drill portion of video at the beginning if you take it at a slower pace."
1,A SLOPPY WASTE OF TIME,"If you want a real workout with a quality instructor, where the class is in synch, where the music actually flows with the movements, where the video is of high quality and doesn't look like someone filmed it with their handycam.. DON'T BUY THIS WORK OUT.. Get yourself a taebo tape with Billy Blanks. No matter how many times Grogan told me to have fun, I was too busy wondering why he didn't edit the tape before he put it on the market... Horrible horrible horrible..POOR QUALITY ALL AROUND. Grogan is dorky, corny, and has 2 left feet, no rhythm, and has no business making work out videos."
5,Rush DVD review,"I thought the movie was very cool! It's loaded with information that was for the most part previously unpublished.As a Rush fan of 24 years, I believe this to be a perfect addition to my collection."
5,Must have for any Rush fans...,"This is more than just another concert video with behind the scenes footage. It is a true documentry of the band and their lives, before, during and after and back again. If all you know about Rush is they are a great three man band from Canada, then you need to see this movie. And you are definatly going to want to keep it, not just rent it. The picture and sound quality are very good, but there is a lot of old footage that can't be helped. Candide interviews with all kinds of Rocker who are still being influienced by Rush. It's excellent and I havn't even watched all of the bonus videos yet."
5,Great dvd for any Rush fan and non fans alike... must see...,"This is a very well done movie. We watched it with people who just didn't ""get"" Rush and after seeing the movie they came away as fans of the band, and my kids have a new appreciation of what it takes to get to that level of musicianship and to be lucky enough to get a record deal..."
1,Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage,"I got this about a month ago,I have tried in 3 diffent DVD players and my computer and it dosen't work.I want to send it back but couldn't get the paper to d0 it.So if someone could help that would be great.Dave Culp"
5,Rockin Memories,"Rush as you may never have seen them. Personal accounts of how it all began, classic for any rock fan!!"
5,First Class,"I have read many books on the Duke of Marlborough, and this is hands-down the best. Lengthy discussion of logistics, strategy, and tactics are boiled down to a manageable and lay-man-accessible size. Fair and balanced evaluation of costs of battles and judgement on the part of the commanders involved, this book is first-rate!"
3,I LIKE THE TRICKS AND THE SPEED,THIS GAME ISNT ALL THAT BAD .IT HAS NICE SPEED AND THE TRICKS ARE NICE .YOU REALLY HALF TO GET THE MOVES DOWN AND PLAY IT AWHILE. ITS NO 1080 BUT ITS NEXT IF YOUR A 1080 FAN AND WANT TO PLAY IN THE SNOW . MY 11 YEAR OLD NEPHEW THINK IT ROCKS SO I BOUGHT HIM ONE AND WE PLAY IT AND ITS COOL TO ME . ONCE AGAIN ITS NO 1080 BUT WOTRH A TRY AND ITS COOL TO PLAY IN THE DARK AND ON 2 PLAYER MODE IT GETS A FUN FEEL AND IT TAKES PRACTICE . ITS NOT ALL THAT BAD IF YOU WANT ANOTHER SNOWBOARDING GAME.ITS A 3 IN A HALF OUT OF 5.
3,Jumbled Text in Kindle Edition,"I am reading this now. It is very strange because within the text there will be words which don't make any sense although they pertain to the same story. I have to train myself to skip ahead for the word which should follow. This is very disgruntling. I am enjoying the story though and plan to finish it. They say the text is put in by volunteers, and I can understand a few typos but this just is strange. Anyone know how the volunteers put in the text? Do they type it, scan it, convert it by some other means?"
3,Not Battleship Potempkin,"but if maybe ""Waterworld"" had a few more fart gags, then it could have been as good as King Frat. Mind you, its nowhere near as good as Captain Lust and His Pirate Women, what a film THAT was, songs and everything! King Frat has a hearse with a beer barrel in it, magic. It is copied unashamedly from Animal House, and to be fair, the number of fart gags in Animal House was an issue that was never really addressed, so if you want Animal House with fart gags, this is your film!"
1,So bad it's bad,"You want to like the movie because it's so awful, but it just ain't possible. The soundtrack song ""King Frat"" was edited for content before being mixed in to the film so you can clearly hear where the f-bombs would go. Feel free to shout them out yourself, I guess.If you pick this video out at the video store, your friends will never let you pick movies again."
4,A surprise ride!,"Before I read this book, I had the advantage of having heard the author read at a book signing in Memphis Tennesee. This book is the kind of book I wish more poets would write. It is more than just a rollercoaster of intense thought and feeling, it is full of statements, statements that need to be heard. I found myself, over and over, nodding my head as I read, captivated by his ability to correlate emotional chaos into peace and understanding. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there were a handful of poems that I just didnt like. Over all, however, great piece of poetry."
5,love it!,"This was very easy to install, and I loved that it came with extra brackets so I could put them up somewhere else and move it to a different place if I wanted. It's sturdy, and I would definitely recommend it. Not for big heavy items, but you could dry a couple mid weight items on it if you needed to."
4,Good For Diapers,"I have it set to mount in both the laundry room and the nursery. It works fine, and I like that I can move it around as needed."
4,very helpful,just finished updating and adding storage to my utility room. this is over my utility sink so things can drip dry. it was very easy to put up. came with all the hardware pieces i needed. decent instructions as well. it seems very sturdy so far. (only been up a few days)
5,fascinating and excellent,"just finished watching this, and absolutely loved it. the only flaw for me was the quicky ending which seemed a little disjointed, but the rest of the series was just wonderful, filled with complex and real characters.yes, some puritans may balk at the frank and realistic protrayal of relationships (including sex), but this, finally, is really how people talk, rather than how we THINK folks talked 50 years ago.great series. highly recommended."
4,I liked it.,"I almost didn't watch this after reading all the negative reviews. Well, not only did I watch it but I anxiously looked forward to each new episode. Yes, there is a lot of sex and nudity. Yes, the actors portraying the older versions of the characters are pretty bad, but that was a very small part of the series. The actors playing the younger characters more than made up for it. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jennifer Ehle in a role completely different from her later Elizabeth Bennet in ""Pride and Prejudice"". I actually found all of the wartime characters to be completely likable and intriguing. The series has already been detailed in previous reviews - if you are a fan of British war series, watch it, it's completely engaging."
5,Who doesn't love Perry?,"This has many of the classics that I remember from childhood. I buy a new christmas CD every year and this one was long overdue as Perry Como has always been a favorite of mine. His rendition of Ave Maria is in a word ""outstanding"". Glad I made the purchase."
5,Outstanding Action Film that Scares You without Terrifying,"The entire cast was wonderful. It was full of action and I loved the way it scared you without being gory. As usual Frasier and the others all performed above and beyond the call of their rolls and my applause to the up and coming Oded Fahr, no other could play his part! This cast was meant for each other, it was if they fed off of one anothers roles. A movie filled with mystic, adventure, a hint of romance and comedy is one of the best I've seen in a long while, can't wait for it to hit the store I'll be first in line to purchase it!"
4,Lighthearted Gothic Action film with topshelf effects,"If you come to view The Mummy do not expect to find the typical gothic horror of the previous movies that deal with this subject. I found The Mummy to be a de-lite-full movie. Lite because of the antics of its not so typical cast, yet because of the visual effects I also found it to be a entertainment delight. Light, daring, thrilling...all around good entertainment, and isn't that what we watch movies for."
5,THE MUMMY: The Ultimate Edition DVD,"THE MUMMY is a remake of a 1939 movie of the same name. This version tells the story of a woman named Evelyn and her brother Johnathan, who discover a map leading to The City of the Dead in Egypt, so Evelyn hires a man named Rick O'Connell to take her and her brother to the mythical city, because he claims he has been there before. Once they get to the City of the Dead, they accidentally unleash a 3,000 year old mummified preist named Imhotep. Now, Imhotep must find and kill the people responsible for ressurecting him so that he can restore all his power and become invincible. This movie has everything; action, horror, romance, and a little bit of humor thrown in for good measure. The Ultimate Edition DVD of this film includes 2 theatrical trailers, wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film, 2 documentaries on the making of the film, and much more."
5,One of the best movies of the year!!!!!!!,"This movie was fantastic!!! The special effects are outstanding!! This movie was not what I had expected, it was better. I almost fell off my seat laughing so hard. I really liked the parts when they unleashed the 10 plagues. That had to be the coolest ever!!!!!!"
1,Typical formula movie,"Typical formula movie. X number of car chases, X number of shoot-outs, X number of explosions. Good special effects can't save a movie with no suspense, no mystery, and no atmosphere. This movie bears no resemblance to the original. Save your money, this is a waste."
1,Marketing at its best!,To sum it - I could have waited for this movie to go to Prime Time cable. It's not even worth renting. The acting is awful and the budget of the movie went primarily to special effects. And if that was the case then the final scene of the monster dying was horribly done. Boy did the marketing department of this movie studio ever fool me. If I could give a zero star - I would.
5,I can't believe it is ten years since I purchased this DVD!,"I bought this DVD 10 years ago and still enjoy it today as much as I did back then. This is a movie that has a lot of fun characters going for it and even with some of the silliness it makes it an entertaining movie to watch. This dvd was a good quality transfer that scales well with modern DVD players that handle the upscaling of the resolution. If you're looking for something entertaining to watch that provides action/comedy and haven't seen this, now is the time."
5,finger to the critics!!,"Dont pay attention to what the critics say. This movie rocks!For all you people that missed a good Indy Jones type of movie, this is one for you. Great special effects, a somewhat great acting, its worth your investment."
3,Not upto the expectations,"I was expecting great special effects and I was expecting to be scared! Well, it is good but not as good as expected."
3,DVD version peversely fascinating,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version. In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director. Might be worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which eventually will happen."
4,Good But Could Be Better,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and I thought it was very entertaining, but it could have been a lot better. I'm definitely not talking about the special effects, which were amazing. And some parts were genuinely funny. But the acting was not that great, and parts of the plot were confusing. Other than that, I thought it was pretty good. :O)"
2,mummy,It was good the only thing I didnt like was the picture on our TV. I dont know to much about DVD movies but the picture was half on the screen. What gives? Movie seemed to fake
1,Burn It!,I bought The Mummy thinking that I'd get an entertaining/exciting action movie... was I sorely mistaken! No amount of special fx this movie throws at you is able overcome the lingering nausea induced by a childish plot and corny Airplane-esque humor. I actually felt deeply embarrassed for the director and cast.I give The Mummy one star for its use as great kindling.
1,Couldn't wait to see it... couldn't WAIT 'til it was over!,Bought bags of Raisenettes and M&M Peanuts to enjoy this movie with... 30 minutes into it and I couldn't wait for it to end. I hate this movie! One of my top 5 all-time bad films. Painful to sit thru!
2,The Temple of Doom? This movie is not...,The Mummy fails to capture the same wonder and excitement of the Indiana Jones movies which it tries so obviously hard to do.This movie never really gets off the ground.
3,The Mummy can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.,"Besides spectacular photography and great sets, this film lacked the terror and suspense one would expect.Frazer was good as the hero but the creature was a major dissapointment.Perhaps the producers should have watched some of the Hammer films for inspiration.No one did it better than them.Even though I thought it was fun I wanted to walk away terrified and I wasn't.Oh well, better luck next time.a"
5,Great Movie...Especially in HD DVD,Too bad HD-DVD didn't win the battle.This movie is incredible as far as effects and action.The HD is wonderful and is a great way to show off your setup.A must for HD-DVD fans
2,MUMMIFIED.,"What else does this movie have to offer besides sheesy special effects? Certainly not a good script and good acting. It's like, let's hire some third rate actors and blow stuff up! Yeah, yeah hahahahaha! This movie was boreing! I was expecting much more, this was a sheesy movie to say the least! I felt mummified while watching it."
2,Thank God I only rented it!,"Well for me this movie had only one saving factor to it. And that is the special effects and the cool Mummy. I think the best way for me to describe the acting is it reminded me of a sitcom in it's first few shows. The actors didn't seem to be comfortable with there characters and it just seemed flat. The one liners where pretty cheesy.All I can say is rent it, if you like it buy it. But don't buy it without seeing it first."
4,Pretty decent action-adventure flick,"(3.5/5 stars) This movie brings to mind some action-adventure movies of old, such as ""Gunga Din"" or ""Bengal Brigade."" Despite the efforts of its keepers, a mummy is inadvertently awakened. It terrorizes a group of treasure seekers and archaeologists with its rather flamboyant magic. Will he be stopped before enslaving humanity? I prefer T.P. to CGI, but CGI's appeal is understandable, especially on such a large scale as this. There is also too much humor in this film. Sparse amounts, sprinkled intermittently, might suit the adventurous mindset of the movie, but it was carried too far here. Apparently the intent was to distance this from the 1932 horror film as far as possible. The likeable Brendan Fraser fits the action hero role well, and I have given this three star movie an extra star since it also features the beautiful Rachel Weisz. This belongs in the same category as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" because both are enjoyable, but not great by any means."
4,This film is not bad!,"Well, I loved the Indiana Jones movies and [guess what!] I love this one as well!The special effects are really good and many of the scenes are hilarious.However, I've only seen this film once, so I'm not sure if it starts to get boring once you've seen it a few more times."
2,What a shame.Could have been GOOD. Characters not developed.,"Could have been a great film. The charactors were not developed to where one could like them or feel empathy for them. The acting and (situation comedy?) was a little hokey.Special effects were fun and very good, but the film missed the oldfashioned scare of the classic horror The Mummy. What a shame!! A lot of $$ was spent on the film."
4,A la Indiana Jones!,"I watched The Mummy because first, it looked like an Indiana Jones type of movie & secondly, I like Brendan Fraser. Meeting my two reasons with satisfaction, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. Brendan was funny & like Harrison Ford, he fought his way through & saved the ""damsel in distress"" as well as obtained their objective/goal.The movie has great effects & it would surely bring you on a rollercoaster adventure."
3,Excellent special effects,This is a pretty good movie. The special effects were outstanding! I have to agree with an earlier viewer that stated that comparing this 1999 version to Boris Karloff's version is a mistake! Although some parts of the story were similar there is no comparison. This movie is worth watching for the special effects alone. The story has some weak spots but overall I found it enjoyable and would watch it again. By the way the DVD version is Packed with extras!
3,A good action flick,"No, the Mummy is not the greatest thing since sliced bread, sure it's not deep, the dialog is lame, whatever. It's still an entertaining and fun film to watch. Especially the beginning, oh my...."
1,Dumb,"Another case where they rely on special effects to make a story scary. Perhaps, they should have invested in a story that would scare someone. Great effects, but the script mixes buffoonish humour with state of the art effects. It doesn't work. Questionable casting as well. this one is a dog, and its mummy's a dog as well."
3,5 stars? I don't think so.,"This movie tries so hard to be another Indiana Jones movie that the script and the over acting makes it mundane to say the least. The only saving grace of this movie is the outstanding graphics, but that is all."
5,A movie you have to watch!!!!,"Hey! When I heard about this movie I went straight to see it at the cinema. I've always been very interested in ancient Egypt and I thought it would be fun to go and see "" The mummy"". It was better than I had hoped. It had everything! It was scary,funny,interesting and a little bit romantic. And not to mention the actors!!!!They were great! A movie you have to watch!!!"
1,its in Spanish!!!!!,"Yes, I had the same problem and it is not mentioned anywhere that it is in Spanish until you get in your hands. I do realize that Las Rubias De 5th Avenue, does not exactly sound English, but knowing the author, I totally thought she is just being fancy!"
5,Absolutely five stars,"What a wonderful book and audio-book! This is an extraordinary coming-of-age novel, with characters that you really care about and a haunting, ambiguous story. Bernadette Dunn is a wonderful narrator for this story as well. I bought a copy of the book after listening to it on tape first, and her voice echoes through my reading.Emma Graham is a wonderful, rare, twelve year old narrator, perched right on the verge of adulthood. Her imaginative child self and her growing intuition about the interesting adults in her life sometimes work together here and sometimes battle each other in a fascinating mix.This is also a beautifully lyrical novel that takes place in a world that seems quite timeless. We are in a recognizable world but not necessarily a specific time.Definitely worth it! It's a gem!"
4,WH books are usually boring,The book I received was in great condition for a used book. Price was great--Book is very largehas colorful pictures---haven't used it for school yet
5,Grohe Soap Dispenser,I purchased two dispensers to replace ones that were constantly breaking at the cost of $20 each. These seem to be well designed and made. Grohe also informed me that if I keep the sales receipt they will replace anything that breaks. By buying 1/4 inside diameter tubing I was able to eliminate the bottles that come with the dispensers and draw the soap out of large gallon containers which cuts down the refill efforts. I will admit getting the soap up the tube to the dispenser was a bit of an effort but once done it works well. I have other Grohe products and have been totally satisfied with them.
2,Ordinary novel from overpraised author,"My second attempt to like Seymour, as did my first, failed.The reviewers who compare Seymour to LeCarre and Greene surely cannot have read much of either. Seymour is more a writer of thrillers, more Clancy-like,than either LeCarre or Greene. Both of the latter write something very close to literature; Seymour (or Clancy for that matter)never come close to that level. His plots are intriging, even at times exciting, but his people portraits rarely more than caricatures."
1,Wish I hadn't spent $30 bucks on it,"I LOVE Law & Order. I watch the show all the time and I have the other 3 games that are currently out. I've played them all. Each generation of games seems to get a little better in regards to the programming and manueverability (I KNOW I spelled that wrong!). This game was a complete disappointment! I experienced almost all the same bugs as some of the other reviewers mentioned.In fact, when holding all the Law & Order games up in comparision to the CSI games, they are seriously lacking in both enjoyment and graphics. I would recommend all the CSI's to anyone who even remotely liked these Law & Order games. I don't watch the show, but I love the games. Can't wait until they come out with more! I seriously hope the writers and programmers get their heads out of their butts and start creating the games I know they are capable of!!"
3,Not the best book for the linguistic novice,"If you have a grasp of the fundamentals of ancient Greek or Latin, then you can use this book to learn Sanskrit. For traditional Indian learners, this book might help to step into the domain of modern Indo-European linguistics. However, non-traditional learners would find 'Introduction to Sanskrit' by Egenes the most useful text in English.Unfortunately, for Indian learners, the (5th grade and up) school texts are so bland that they take the fun away from the language. I think more senior students should stick to the Mugdhabodha and its commentaries as the laborious path to Panini. A 100 year old text by Ishwar Chandra Sharma (Vidyasagar) was a good read; this text is available in Bengali only."
4,Dominican Mambo,Mangu's cd is a classic in the latin hip industry just because there is no other artist or group that musicaly acomplished what Mangu and his producers did. This cd is a must if your into latin hip hop/salsa/mambo/reggae all in one....
1,Fusion Power Blades,"I bought these blades and was overcharged on shipping by $28.00US If you check the fraud pictures posted on the internet these fall under the fake category.I bought these for friends and family and i get responses that these blades do not stay sharp. The blue glide strip does not wear like normal ones. No serial numbers, Indent on outside of cartridge that signifies fake blade the metal clip holders not bent down to hold blades secure to cartridge again are being sold as fake.Just not the same shave as authentic blades should be.Not happy with purchase"
4,Awesome shave but be careful!,"The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever, and I have a very thick beard, and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless. One thing though, you have to be very careful. One slip of the hand and BAM! I've cut my lips 3 times now, twice bleeding profusely. So be careful..."
3,Too much of a good thing.,"My short, and to the point review: Keep your 3 blade Mach-3 razor unless you shave EVERY DAY. If you let your beard get a little ""scruffy"", the Gillette Fusion Power razor feels like Velcro catching across your face! There are simply too many points of contact along your face with this razor. It is a very nice, well constructed product, but five blades are just not reasonable in my opinion."
2,Are these really brand new? or just seconds?,"I've used fusion blades for quite awhile, but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual. They're mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal. (I threw one away immediately.) I emailed the seller inquiring, but they did not reply."
4,Good shave,A good shave but blades don't last long enough to make up for high price.It shaves very smooth.I use it regularly.Would like to see them cheaper though.
5,Fantastic Item,"Best Razor I've used yet. I progressed from the Mach 3 to the Schick Quatro and was happy with teh move. With this move from the Quatro to the Fusion, the difference was astronomical. I've heard mixed reviews on the vibrating aspect of razors, personally, it is great for the Fusion."
1,Disappointed with quality,"The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real. They are fake. I am not able to use them, they hurt so much. the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly. they don't have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have. I'll never buy anything from this retailer."
1,Cut Face,"This pack of cartridges must have been laying around in the back yard for sometime. Used all eight in two day's trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge. I guess this is one item you don't buy from an online retailer."
2,This review is for the R-Rated version,"Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay, but get the unrated one instead."
1,Out of date -- don't buy,This book documents version 1.0.2 of JDK. Sun is up to version 1.3 and has made dramatic additions since 1.0.2. Don't buy something so out of date.
3,A step backwards from BHD,"Got this as a presumed update to Nova's Black Hawk Down, which had some of the graphics and vehicle features of the more complex, multiplayer Joint Ops, but with the more streamlined play of BHD. I've been disappointed.First off, this seemed to be a bigger drain on the graphics card than even JO, which I would think is more complex, with a little bit of stutter in some of the frame rates.Second, and more frustrating, was the departure from the user interface of DF/BHD - in particular the sight picture of every weapon, particularly the sniper rifles is a huge step backwards.All and all, after migrating from BHD to JO to DFX, I'm back to playing multiplayer BHD while I await something better. Probably a good buy for $20, but not if you already have BHD or prefer multiplayer play."
4,An entertaining classic,"An excellent book, one of the defining classics of the genre. It does have a few minor factual errors here and there, but overall a great book on the subject matter. Put simply, it is overflowing with information. It's also a very entertaining read, which makes it more than a simple reference. Worth the investment, even for those who are already well versed in the topic."
3,Towel holder,"It arrived slightly bent. We hung it up in the bathroom anyway, but can tell it is uneven. Serves the purpose for the bathroom towel rack. Feel it is a little overpriced."
1,One word -- sucks !!,This is probably one of the worst Computer Science book I have ever read. The author uses ML for most of the examples...which is a pain in the ass. The explanation is vague and examples were not good enough.And you know what? I am using this book simply because I am taking a course with Mr John Mitchell himself.
1,this is cheap junk,I couldn't even bring myself to give this gift it was so pathetically junky. It should have been $5.
4,Power Pop for Now People,"I caught their set at CMJ in New York and fell in love with this Scottish pop band's catchy songs. This CD is great! If you like Teenage Fanclub, The Figgs, or the La's you'll dig Astrid."
2,What?,"Well, I love the ocean and everything in it and about it. My daughters room is decorated with a ""fishy"" theme. However, I wasn't impressed with this at all! First off, the batteries wear out too quick! And yes, I DID turn it off when she wasn't using it. And yes, I DID use new batteries. Also, the fish that ""swim"" get stuck and don't move and the glitter clumps into one spot. The balls were a hit though! She loves those!"
4,Lots of fun!,"My son has had this toy since before he was old enough to 'play' with it. Back then, he liked to look at the lights and listen to the music during 'tummy time'. Now that he sits up, he can pull the balls out and tip the bowl over. For some reason, he likes to chew on the edge, too. This toy seesm very durable. At first, I thought the balls might break if dropped on my laminate floors, but they haven't. My son enjoys this fishbowl."
5,We Love this Toy!,Gavin has loved this toy since he was tiny. When he was little I would sit it near him because it takes very little to make the music and lights go. If he would move his little hands and feet the music and lights would start.He is now nearly 7 months old and he loves to take the balls out and then put them back in (he's going to be a basketball pro...haha!). He also likes to try to chew on/lick the balls. He tries to drink the fishbowl. We are pretty sure that he thinks it's a big cup of water!Great toy! Fun! Not annoying like some of our other musical toys!
3,fishbowl is so-so,"I think the initial concept of this toy was great. It is a cute toy and my son likes to play with it, but it usually only occupies him for a few minutes and then he moves on. The bowl is very sensitive and starts playing the repetitive two sounds when I just walk by it. It doesnt teach him to put the balls back in for this reason. He would rather just roll the balls around on the floor. With a few adjustments and some more sounds this could be a better toy."
5,One of our favorites,"My son loved this toy as an infant! The sounds are adorable, and the lights are entertaining. He liked putting the ""fish"" in and taking them out over and over. He still thinks this toy is fun at two years old (usually when he sees someone else playing with it!) I would recommend it for any child under 18 months."
5,Love this toy! A must have!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was five months old and just starting to sit up well. At first she just liked to kick it and make the lights and music go off, but as she got older she learned to drop the balls in and would do so for almost 20 minutes at a time! She is now nine months old and the toy has been kicked, banged, sat on, and it's still in perfect shape and one of my daughter's favorite toys! My only compliant about this toy is that it only has a gurgle sound and one song and with as much use as it gets I am so very tired of listening to it over and over. My brother is having a baby soon and I have already bought one of these for him. A definite must have!"
4,a great alternative to the real one!,"Eversince my daughter saw a fish in an aquarium, she couldn't stop saying fish! I wanted to get her one, but I am not really too crazy about fish ( I am more of a dog person). On her first birthday she got this toy and she's been playing with it eversince! It just works for me, since I do not have to deal with the cleaning of a real tank and feeding a real fish! The more important thing is she is happy and that's all that matters!"
3,Not worth the money,"I really wanted this toy for my daughter because I thought it would be fun for her. She doesn't play with it all that often, never really did. I think you can spend $15 on a better toy that they will play with more often."
5,Great Toy!,My fiancee and I bought this for our niece who is three months old. She loves to grab the balls and hear the sounds when we help her drop them in. I think that this is a great toy from a wonderful manufacturer. This toy will definately be one of those toys that is hard to part with and is passed from family member to family member.
4,important,"at 15 I was dealing with a abusive father, a mom that didn't really care, and racists bullies at school. It sent me into hiding in my room, I dropped out. And later, got labeled ED. And was put into foster care for the remainder of my childhood. My father never got brought to justice for his crimes, however my label of ed stuck! an opportunistic lcsw (probably adl spy) set about getting me labeled as a threat. so here I am, never committed a crime, although arrested for one, I am no threat and never was. And the police still consider me a edp, threat, and as a result I am being mercilesly harassed by community police members, police and others. If you really care about children be very very careful when labeling them disturbed. Once you are in the system you are always in the system. I can't work and I am harassed all the time, I should have just staid silent, let my father have his way with me instead of dealing with a lifetime of harasment?"
4,Frankie and Jerry,"Frankie Ruiz is my fave salsa singer. His voice is one of a kind and his lyrics are just as unique. Jerry is another one of my faves but I have to admit that I was a little biased when I bought the CD. I didn't quite like the idea of someone singing songs that I'm so used to hearing Frankie sing. I didn't think that Jerry would be able to pull this off but he did. Though I know in the back of my mind that no one can sing Frankie Ruiz songs like Frankie, Jerry does a good job at this tribute to him. We couldn't have asked for a better person to do this than him. My fave songs on the album are ""Puerto Rico"", ""Para Darte Fuego"", ""Mi Libertad"", and ""Separemos Nuestras Vidas"". I recommend this to anyone that misses Frankie as much as I do and would like to hear a different take on his songs.No one can take Frankie's place as the ""Father of Salsa"" and I think Jerry made this CD to remind everyone that there is and will only ever will be one KING!!!!!I Love You Frankie!!!!"
4,Kasey and extra cartridges,"I bought this toy for my grandson last Christmas and he truly enjoyed it. However I found trying to buy any extra cartridges to go with my grandson's advancing age group is impossible. The cartridge that came with this toy was great. However I have been everywhere and can not find additional cartridges ( other than the four or five that are for pre-school) I bought this with the understanding that it would grow with the child. Where are the ""older"" kids cartridges?"
5,A fun way to teach your child about Christmas.,Veggie Tales are just great. I laughed til I cried reading this book and listening to the tape. WONDERFUL Christmas songs with a Veggie Tales twist. The book has your child reading right along with the cassette. Highly recommended. My 2 year old loves this year round.
1,Poor quality,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my niece and ended up returning it. At first, I thought maybe some of the pieces were missing from the package as it appeared to have been previously opened, but I don't think that was the case. It just looked really cheap so I returned it and got a Timex with a butterfly-theme band. She loves it!"
3,a stern reckoning,it is a pity that government does not make public most of the reports even after 30 years.it is refreshing change to the trend that this book got published. It is a collective effort of scholars which have concentrated on the work at hand and came out brilliantly.the only problem is its strict adherence to government formats of long ago which affects its readability.
5,Great Suspense Movie,"One of the better spy movies around. Gene Hackman gives another fine performance, plenty of action, locales remembered from my years in the service and a great, believable script. A welcome addition to my video library, and will be re-watched often."
5,Good Book on battles and campaigns,"If you are in the market for a good book on the major battles and campaigns of the Revolutionary Army then this is the book for you. The author does an excellent job in describing each event without going to exacting detail and boring the reader. If you do not get pulled into the war after reading this book then you need to reread it slowly to better absorb the knowledge within its pages.I agree with another reviewer: ""This excellent piece of scholarship and tale of high deeds belongs on every enthusiasts bookshelf....""Pick up a copy at Amazon.com!"
2,Revolutionary War Battles,I was very disappointed upon receiving this book from Amazon.com. I had seen it at Barnes & Noble bookstore and was looking forward to having my own copy as an addition to my home library. The book I received was a paper back book which I was aware of but the Amazon.com description did not describe it as a pocket size book. I do not buy pocket size book for my home library cause I do not enjoy using them for reading or research work. The book would have been much more helpful if it had more table information and list as well as biographical information for the leaders of the battles. Chapter outlines or summaries would have been a real plus also. I wish I had bought the larger copy at the higher price at Barnes & Noble bookstore. You get what you pay for.
1,Warning: Copy-Controlled!!!,"This apparently is a ""Copy Controlled"" by EMI CD. Great.Any CDs I buy these days, I personally tend to rip to mp3s so I can listen to on the portable player I use. Oh well. Won't work on things like many car CD players, either.Buyer beware. 5 stars for Madredeus and their music. F- for the music industry pulling stunts like this that harm the average consumer's personal use while the ""bad guys"" get around things regardless.If only they'd spend more time and effort finding and developing more acts like Madredeus in the first place.Don't buy this particular version unless you're ready for some hassles. Ugh...."
4,Decent product,The product seem to be good quality did not have anything to compare to don't know how helpful i can really be.
3,Good sound.,"I heard a track on the radio and really liked the arrangement plus the guitar sound. The CD on the whole lacked some creativity and the slower tracks got a wee bit dull. They were OK, you needed to hang in there, but more creativity was needed. There are about 3 tracks that are superb. But that was the prob. with the whole CD --- more punch and creativity needed."
5,Top to Bottom,"This CD is pleasant from beginning to end. Much like ""Life is full of Possibilities"", I believe the 1st track is the class of the CD. However, the rest of it will not dissapoint. Dntel has a sound VERY much different than The Postal Service.. and I don't just mean the lack of vocals. Dntel sounds much more analog.. natural, than the poppy, digitized sound of The Postal Service. It is a very soothing set of tracks. I only wish he stuck to this style. If you can find this CD, get it."
2,"Nice material, sizes are inconsistant","I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL, but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!!This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen. And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again."
2,Cheaply made.,"Seems like a great product, but after recieving the first one. The FM radio didn't work and the light didn't work. The second one I recieved as a replacement, the radio worked, but still the light did not work. I was tired after this time and settled. My husband took it apart and fixed the light, but it wouldn't seal completely after closing, so he had to put tape around it. Wasn't worth all the hassle."
1,Does the term...waste of good plastic mean anything?,"The worst product. Put the batteries in and I thought the on/off button was going to fall...off! No radio, no light, but hey, the digital quarter inch clock was flashing! Went to turn the AM-FM knob and thought holy crap! I need to go to the gym to turn this switch, but felt better moving the radio knob, it only requires you to bench about 400 pounds!"
3,Expensive...,"I bought this on Amazon as it is not yet available here in India. Purely as replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now). There is not much to review on the replacement cartridges.As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving. The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach , but I could be mistaken there as I've been using it for a a few days only now.For the price, the packaging is pretty flimsy."
1,Much Too Expensive,"I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges, I have tossed my Fusion. Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I'm concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I'm not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges."
5,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,I always get a great shave with the Gillette Fusion and had been buying these razor cartridges from a local store up until last week when I noticed I could get them online for a lot less.
1,GILLETTE PRODUCT ONLINE FAKE FROM CHINA,"AFTER CONVERSATION WITH GILLETTE, I GOT INFORMATION, THAT NON OF PRODUCT SOLD WITH GILLETTE NAME A LEGAL. GILLETTE NOT AUTORIZED TO SELL ANYONE AND DON'T HAVE ANY ONLINE STORES TO SELL THEY PRODUCT.ALL THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FROM GILLETE MADE IN CHINA AND BEING A BAD COPY/ FAKE PRODUCT.BE WARE AND JUST CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY"
1,Fake Fusion cartridges,I wish I could give a negative rating. The replacement cartridges were complete fakes. It only takes 2 seconds to figure out they aren't real Fusion blades. It's like shaving with broken glass. The seller immediately refunded my money though which was nice.
5,Great deal,"Love the close shave that I get from these razors. They last longer than the cheep store brands, which cost more and are not as comfortable."
5,As advertised ...,"I really like this razor and blades. The blades stay sharp a LONG time, and they rinse out nicely after use. This packaging option with 8 blades is very convenient - fewer times to run out. My only wish would be that they were less expensive."
1,"These may be factory knock-offs, buy direct from Gillette","There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $3/each, guaranteed to be factory originals. I'd be wary of buying these bulk razors from Amazon..."
3,Awkward,"I have only used the volume discount throw away razors for 30+ years. Two weeks ago I decided to try the Gillette Fusion. Below is my evaluation:1) very smooth shave2) awkward feel. Too heavy. However, well balanced.3) can't seem to get into tight spots as well as disposable shavers. (IE. under nose, near lips)Summary: I bought 8 replacement cartridges and will give it more time to determine if I stay with the Fusion."
5,Fusion Blades (The Best Blade Hands Down),"I have tried them all and the winner is Gillette Fusion. You get a close shave all the time with no nicks and no cuts. The price from Amazon.com can't be beat either. Don't waste your money on the power version, the shave is the same! Gillette Products rule!!!"
5,Gillette fusion is the best razor,"I've tried many other razors before but nothing compares to these guys. They're good, but expensive. Buy them online and you'll cut your costs in half!"
2,dumb,"I didn't understand The Beginning part. In Cave Cat, there was a dog dinosaur! And there were cave men too! In Sam Spayed, they said bad words and where were all the humans? Everyone were cats! And in The Exterminators, how did the cats talk? Garfield can't talk! Lab Animal was weird and stupid! I didn't understand Primal Self! And in Garfield, Jon said he bought Odie. But in the comic strip, Odie was Jon's roomate's dog and Odie moved in with the roomate. And Space Cat was disappointing because the space thing turned out to be a video game! The book didn't have a good ending. If you want to buy this book, think hard about it!"
5,I've been using these for 3 years now.,I love these shrink window kits. I've been using these for 3 years now. I don't think they'll stick to a metal specially a cold one but my windows are all wood and for my patio door I use my floor (laminate) to stick it to the bottom and the framing is all wood so I've had no issues at all.
1,Better stuff out there than this junk,"We just did 6 windows in our house with the Duck brand from Wal-mart and it worked great! It was our first time ever using a window insulation kit for our windows and it was fairly easy to do. The tape worked really well and we didn't have any issues. So we were at Home Depot and thought we'd buy a kit for the patio door, we saw the Frost King, figured it would be just like the Duck brand we used and so we bought it. After hours of frustration this morning, I have finally ripped it down and threw it in the garbage. What a waste of money, now I will be heading back to Wal-mart to buy a Duck brand kit for the patio door. I hate Wal-mart but it is worth it to use a product that actually works. There tape is much more durable and thicker than the thin stuff you get with Frost King. I don't know how much the kits cost at Wal-mart seeing as someone gave us the insulation kit but it can't be too expensive."
3,All the elements are here. They just need a bit of polish.,"FER-DE-LANCE is our introduction to the realm of Nero Wolfe and his capable assistant Archie Goodwin. Al, the elements are here, the office, Fritz and his culinary skills, Theodore and the orchids, and the general idea of Wolfe's eccentricities are well-conveyed. There are a few oddities, like Saul Panzer being on salary and Archie lacking the sophistication he shows later, that are forgotten as the series continues, but the overall tone is set. The mystery itself with a rather far-fetched murder is not the strongest, neither are the loose ends left dangling, some kind of denouement for Carla Maffei perhaps, and some rather unfortunate stereotyping make this one of the weaker outings, but there is definitely enough here to make Nero Wolfe a character that mystery lovers will be willing to follow for many years to come."
4,First sighting of Wolfe,"Of course, a must read for Wolfe fans. Archie has yet to find his true voice, and there's no Cramer yet, but Wolfe starts as he means to go on. Stands the test of time better than any of the other early books before Some Buried Caesar. A good and original plot."
3,Forget openMosix part.,"Just wanted to mention that openMosix - which is proposed in the book as an attractive component for the cluster, was discontinued in March, 2008. Right now I'm working with other parts such as Oscar, using the book more as a guideline than as a howto manual - nevertheless, it handles a very easy language and explains very clearly most concepts."
2,It is too thin,"it looks cool, but It is too thin and kind of small. If you want some thing really warm, it is not good enough for you."
3,It's fine,"Thinness is a plus, fitting between my face & helmet. However, after only a couple months, the threads are already falling apart and tickling my nose when I ride- A bummer distraction."
4,Great for the Price,"This was my first Balaclava and I use it for cold weather cycling and taking the dog on runs. By cold weather, I mean midwest temperatures of 25-45 degrees. As for sizing, my head is about 23"" in circumference. On me, this is a good fit. Easy to put on, snug, and fits under a bike helmet. I could see how someone with a much larger head would feel this is too tight.The only reasons I don't give this 5 stars are:1) It's a little overly snug on my nose (a minor annoyance, really).2) It's really only a wind barrier and not very insulating. In 25-45 degree weather, it's fine for the 10-20 minutes I'm outside and active, but for longer stays or colder weather, this would probably not be enough."
2,Poor workmanship,"the materials are very good, but the workmanship is disappointing, at the second wash begins to unpick, I just use it 2 times, materials are thin"
3,ZANheadgear Urban Nylon Balaclava....small fit,"I really liked this Balaclava there's just one problem its to damn small!! iv tried stretching it out still little tight, if you got a really small head go for it, if not don't buy!!"
1,Garbage,"It is way too tight... I thought it was just me, but I let a couple friends try it and it was way to tight on them as well. It will smash your nose to your face and smear your lips across your face.Purchase this product if you want a flat face with a headache!"
4,just what I needed,I got this to wear under my Death Skull Bone Airsoft Full Face Protection Safety Mask. makes wearing a mask more comfortable than being on bare skin.
5,Great!,"Very small so I do not recommend older people, especially men, getting this just in case. I'm using this as a base for my fursuit and is exactly what I needed"
4,Good Value,It's hard for me to find one of these that is'nt made from too heavy of a material and thus too hot when I use it on my bike in the winter. This one was a good weight material. My only complaint was it was a little tight but I think it will strech in time.
1,Fantasies of the Past,"I agree with the other reviewer that this book is dated in the light of later studies, esp. in archaeology and more critical examinations of historical sources. The sole reason for its revival is the current demand for books with an Islamic theme. Otherwise this book would be next to useless. It is more fantasy than fact."
2,"Annoying, and no re-play value","Like many players, I found the disk changing aspect quite annoying. Also, the graphics, for requiring as much hardware as they do, were rather poor. The LoL:GoD graphics were better, and that's sad, since it came out years earlier, and they were worse than the ones in the first game! Also, I don't think the game setup is all that fun; the guild idea would be cooler if you couldn't join every one. Like, if you had to give something up to play the game through, thereby creating re-play value. As it stands, LoL3 should have gone through more review sessions before being published. Westwood, have you ever heard of beta testers?"
5,Fabulous!,This is the greatest sports bra I have ever owned! I love the adjustable straps and that it clasps in the back. It gives me great support and keeps the girls in place when I'm jogging. I would highly recommend this bra to other large busted women.
5,It's about time somebody addressed Oracle objects!,"This is the first book that I have seen that explains the issues involved when using objects within Oracle. Object-orientation can be very confusing, and Anstey has done an excellent job of explain these concepts in plain English."
1,"Worst ""Clancy"" book I have read","Although I have read only a few of the ""Clancy"" knock-offs, I have to say this is the worst. I cannot believe Tom Clancy allowed his name to be associated with this book. It was plain boring."
1,Disgusting,"This is the cheapest and most poorly designed racing wheel i have ever used. It is very uncomfortable on your lap or on a table. It cannot be calibrated and has no shifter. Do your self a favor and buy the Mad Catz MC2 racing wheel instead of this. It is incredible. I dont beleive it is on this sight, but look for it, its a great deal. Once again, dont waste your thirty dollars on this product."
2,A very silly book.,"I found it very difficult to extract the information I needed from this book. There are far too many ""Well let's see."" and ""Simple, right?"", and silly analogies which dilute the material. The author can't make a point without embedding it in a story. I'd rather read the Oracle documentation and avoid the annoying task of weeding through irrelevant text."
5,A truly stunning masterpiece,"The Pat Metheny Group achieved their grand apex with this 1985 release. This is one of those rare albums of such stunning beauty that you are almost overwhelmed...speechless. I agree with another reviewer that the title track is one of the greatest songs of our time -- a cinematic epic full of optimism and performed with breathtaking finesse. ""If I Could"" is one of the most exquisitely gentle acoustic guitar tracks I've ever heard, and ""Mas Alla (Beyond)"" is tear-jerking rush of emotion fueled by Pedro Aznar's incomparable voice. DO NOT be fooled by the ""Forward March"" introduction, which is a jokey sketch deliberately played off-key like a poorly rehearsed high school marching band -- as if to disguise the rush of musical perfection that follows.I can't say enough good things about this album, suffice to say that this a bona fide ""desert island disc"" that will change your life."
4,My favorite Metheny CD,"I listened to this cassette quite a bit back in 1985 and then left it for quite a while. Last year (2003), I was amazed to find myself humming ""Yolanda, You Learn"" and ordered the CD from Amazon. Discovering this music all over again was a joy. To me, this is a CD of uplifting, joyous music made by fantastic musicians offering up some incredible performances.While I have listened to other Metheny releases, nothing has touched me like this one. I would loved to have given this five stars, but the decision to include ""Forward March"" was a mistake. Fortunately, modern CD players can be programmed to skip tracks. My favorite tracks are ""Yolanda, You Learn,"" ""The First Circle,"" and ""Praise."" ""If I Could"" is so beautiful in its simplicity as to bring you to goosebumps and tears.If you are a guitarist or lover of Brazilian music, this CD is a must-have. This release is totally accessible to all lovers of quality music. Highly recommended."
2,"Pass: Novelty item, not real usable","Though very well built, and fun to hold, it's not usable if you're already good at first-person shooters using a mouse -well, not without some serious retraining of your hand and wrist. Especially games heavy on right-click, like Unreal Tournament. It's basically a mouse, only bulkier and less comfortable for extended play."
3,Fun for a few minutes,"The kid loves it for playing a few games that do not require extensive use of mouse button 2 or 3 , but it is not practical or easy to use for anything else. I only paid a couple dollars for it, so I do not feel cheated."
5,Awesome & Acurate,All the books by this author (I've read 90% of them so far) are excellent. Entertaining and informative. These are much better than the Sweep series in my opinion becuase they actually teach principles of wicca rather than just entertain. Too bad there are only 15 - wish there were more books by this author.I recommend to anyone adult or teen looking into wicca.
1,OY!!!,"I received this book from a friend of mine who knew that Jane Eyre was one of my favorite books...and it is only out of love for her that I finished it....The idea of story of Jane Eyre being told through Adèle's perspective, at first, absolutely delighted me. But I had assumed that Emma Tennant would have at least STUCK TO Charlotte Bronte's story!You start to read it and begin to note the creative liberties and changes that the author made; they start small only startling you a little, making you wonder where the author's twists intend to take you. Then it just becomes ridiculously laughable. LAUGH OUT LOUD laughable!It is a very 'creative' story and an easy read (if your stomach can take it). I only recommend this people who read Jane Eyre a loooooong loooong time ago, and only vaguely recollect events and names....it will put the reader in the same frame of mind that the author was in."
2,Not so good.,"I remember reading a portion of this novel in a class in which I read Jane Eyre. That excerpt sparked my interest but, when I started reading this novel, that interest was quickly sullied by the bad prose, inattention to detail, and the stupidity of the plot (especially toward the end). This book is not worth your time or money. For a much better ""rewrite"" of Jane Eyre, read Jean Rhyss' Wide Sargasso Sea."
5,RESIN CARTRIDGE,Love this item. It purifies my water 100%. I should have bought 2 of them. lol. But the item does it's job just the same
2,Not very happy,"I'm disappointed with this product. I agree with the reviewer who said that the wire with the plastic button doesn't hold the cover firmly in place. This makes the food spill all over the ground. The holes are too big, too. I put tape on the inside over the openings to make them smaller so if the feeder tips less spills out. Also, when you fill it, it's too easy for the plastic sides to get dislodged--then the food really pours out. On top of all this, the birds seem to prefer my $7.99 feeder from the hardware store. I'm not going to toss this, but I wouldn't buy it again. More trouble than it's worth, and wasteful."
2,"Nice looking, but sloppy feeder","At first, I was quite pleased with the feeder. It looks nice and the birds (although restricted to small birds) frequented this feeder often, to the point where I was going through bird seed fairly quickly. However, when I took a closer look, I found most of the bird feed on the ground. When I started watching the birds very closely, I would estimate that for every seed the bird took from the feeder, 3 or 4 seeds would fall to the ground. The feeding holes are fairly large and I expect this contributes to the seed falling out."
3,wasteful,the product material is flimsy and weightless. i feel it loses too much seed without a tray underneath to catch overflow.
3,"Looks cute, easy to spill","This feeder is very cute and holds a great amount of seed but the openings are so big that the birds (at my house anyway) stick their heads in and shake, sending seed all over the place. This makes the bunnies, chipmunks, and squirrels on the ground very happy but means the feeder, big as it is, is always out of seed in less than a day. Frustrating! I'm going to try and rig a fix, decreasing the size of the openings."
2,Bird Feeder,This is one of the worst bird feeders I've ever bought. It allows the birds to waste seed and the top doesn't stay seated.
4,Nice rack,"This rack was as-advertised and easy to install, although I had to redo it to make sure it went far enough back to also function as a mud guard. My only minor complaint is that it's designed to accommodate a particular brand of rear light/reflector mounted on the back, but I wish it was designed a little more generically to handle the light and reflector that I currently have mounted on my seat post."
3,"Strong rack, simple to install, missing screws","I was able to install this in place of my old rack within a few minutes. The package was missing a few screws and nuts (but I was able to use ones from my old rack to make up the difference). The rack itself is well-made and feels very strong. The spring arm is useful for carrying lighter loads. I have yet to try out the quick mount system, but I have a bag on order that uses it. I will post a review on that when I've tried it out."
5,Good rack with spring,I installed this on my bike and have had it for over a month. Installation was straight forward. Quality is really great. I prefer this over the springless version since you don't have to secure your load with strings. No problems so far. The spring is pretty tight and the rack does not creak over rough road or bumps.
3,Broken support tube on rack,I use this to carry about 30 pounds of lead acid batteries and after a year one of the support tubes broke in half in the back on it.Also the spring thing on it rattles and makes a lot of noise I had to tie wrap it down.
3,easy to set up,"this is very easy to set up. Be careful and put a blanket or towel down, because the plastic on the bottom gets very hot in the sun."
5,Great gift idea,I got this as a gift for a friend in California and they raved about it so I got it for another friend who independently told me it was one of the most useful gifts they have recieved.
2,Tough to put together,"Once put together, this tent is exactly what we wanted. The issue is actually getting it assembled. It took two people to get the poles into their holders. We were hoping to bring this to the beach with us but I can't imagine trying to get it set up while our little one is sitting in the sun. I think it's worth it to pay slightly more money and get a pop-up tent."
3,"Not for the active baby, but good for the little ones","During our annual trip to SoCal, our son was just starting to crawl at 7mos. I picked up this tent so he'd have some refuge from the sun and could nap inside.I had also hoped he's be able to play as well, but half the time he was interested in pushing against the mesh walls, which withstood his efforts, but I don't think they would have if he was a month older.This is definitely a good tent for the immobile or barely mobile baby to hang out in if you're on a beach vacation.I suppose if you hold on to it long enough, it'll make for a good play area when they're a little older and don't want to pull up on everything.Decent quality of construction and ease of portability."
3,Questions Before Purchase,"I wanted to ask a few questions before I purchase this item, does this tent have the mesh/net on all sides?"
2,it was just okay,"we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun. we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent. however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it. the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over. i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!"
4,Liking the play tent,"I used this play tent for my daughters first time at the beach and we really like it. It's a good size for her (she's 2 months) but if she were older maybe it would be a little small. It's really easy to put together plus a great price, the only down side is that it cant stand up to wind. It was really windy at the beach when we went, but she held it down being inside and was okay. Overall I'd recommend it."
3,Great for the price,"This tent is great for the price. It is kind've a pain to put up though. It is great for the kids to play with at home, but when we went to the beach, it took me 5 minutes to get it up and by that time I was so hot, sweaty and irritated. It does not keep the sun out and it is very hot in there. I would recommend it for a play room."
2,"Boring, not very educational","My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead."
4,Symphony Rock N Play,I bought this for my children. It is a wonderful toy. Except for the seat. The younger chidren are afraid to sit on it. My two year old falls out of the seat very easily. The seat is too narrow just be careful of any furniture nearby. Except for that problem they love it.
5,Lots of Fun,My 8 mo. old received this for Christmas and loves it. She plays and dances and has figured out that when it stops all she has to do is hit the keys. The only thing I don't like about it is the seat. It sits too far away from the piano and is too small. The seat is unsafe for children who are not walking yet. We removed it and it works great with her sitting on the floor.
3,Immortally good.,"This movie is a great adaptation of the original video game. The action sequences were amazing and the special effects were great. The underlying plot line is that several of Earth's greatest warriors are recruited to compete in a tournament that will decide the fate of their souls and of us all - if an individual looses then their soul is forfeit to the evil wizard Shang Tsung. If one of Earth's combatants doesn't win the tournament then a God-like dictator from another dimension gets to take over the planet. All of the major characters from the original game make an appearance along with reproductions of the original fight locations.As far as movies go, this one pretty much follows the classical Hollywood cinema style where Dorthy leaves Kansis, things get out of control in Oz and then things go back to normal in the end - although there is a bit of a twist at the end."
1,heinous,"This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured."
4,Intriguing,"I read this in one sitting, so you can see it is pretty interesting. I get the feeling Dahl was a really honest person. His account of how he learned to fly and was dumped right into fighting German airplanes without any fighter pilot training is amazing and rather frightening. He mentions several times the number of young lives lost because of the lack of training and support. One of the grim aspects of war. The accounts of living in Africa, black mambos and lions, pretty strong stuff too."
2,Feedback on the book,"This book talks about Roald Dahl when he was young. He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."
1,Way Too Narrow,"I have never seen shoes so narrow! I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe. So, if you have narrow feet, I would recommend to not order the narrow size but, instead, the next width size up.Also, as an extra heads up, if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes (where these were from) and need to return the shoes for a refund, make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs (cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes). I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs (on the email sent to you from them) was unclear and the communication from them (when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs) was terse."
4,good fit,I always liked the Easy Spirit shoes.These are very comfortable and a good buy.I may order another pair in a different color.I would recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable shoe.
5,This is an excellent product.,"I have worn this style of Easy Spirit shoe for many years. I'm so thankful that it hasn't chaged. It's stylish, yet very comfortable and gives my feet excellent support. I thoroughly recommend it."
4,Solid work shoes,I have been wearing this style for years at work where I am always on my feet. I was unable to find them at the Easy Spirit outlet but got them here no problem
5,great product,This is the first time I bought this product. Actually I bought it for my father who is very naive in using advanced technologies. The manual version of this razor was perfect for him. He likes it so far. The precision of shaving is great. It is little expensive as compared to other available razors. But it is a great product for the amount you pay. I would recommend this one to others. I hope the blades will last long enough which I am yet to find out.
3,Not really all that great,I bought this razor thinking that it would be better than anything that I ever used before. It turned out that a twin blade disposable still gives me the best shave I ever had and this fusion razor is just a ploy to get you to buy something new. What is next? A twenty blade razor? Ha ha.
5,Beats out my Mach 3 Turbo hands down,"I went from disposables to the Mach 3 Turbo when they sent me one in the mail, and i loved it, got so much closer. Now i use the Fusion exclusively. Some say the 5 blades is a gimmic, but i can feel a difference in that i dont cut myself at all, and the surface is wide enough to cut more at a time."
1,Excellent results -- if you have already shaved,"This razor ranks on par with single blade disposable bic shavers.It is positively awful. Right out of the box it caught my beard and felt like it had been used to strip varnish off the furniture. I thought it was something with the first one and tried a second. Same deal.I wondered if maybe I was doing something different so after trying it once and finding it unsuitable, I used a one week old, used several times, two blade generic disposable razor. It was far and away much better, much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel, foam and shaving in the shower. Nothing can redeem it. Well.. one thing.I noticed that after I shaved with another razor, this razor glides over the skin quite smoothly."
5,Beyond awesome!,"When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get. And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was. Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT!!!"
3,The good and the bad,"First, the bad. The Precision Trimmer is way overhyped. In theory, it's a great idea: it's difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn't work. In the first place, either the blade isn't sharp enough or it's burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it's a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn't worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can't say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three."
3,Gillette Fusion Manual Razor,I like the precision of the razor but you have to use a thin shave balm. Whiskers get caught in the blades. You have to rinse the razor more often.
5,Healing and fragrant,My 78 pd German shepherd was in major discomfort with dry skin. The vet left me with a 300 dollar options with multiple diagnosis. I devices to only try the topical solution which ws this shampoo. it cured 90 % of the problem. We are giving fish oil to try and help improve overall health of his coat.....excellent product with great results and smells great.....
4,great with my ultrasonic jewelry machine,"I got this for Christmas to go with my new ultrasonic jewelry cleaner machine. I put just a capful in, and ran it at least 5-7 times. It made all my jewelry sparkle! I don't love the price, but at the rate of using a capful now and then, hopefully it will last awhile. Definitely worth it as a companion to the machine."
3,Suspend belief and enjoy,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
1,What Maisie Knew.....Do I Really Care?,"I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better."
2,Murky and weird,"I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James. The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure. I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine. Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel. I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side. Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun!"
1,don't waste your money,"This book was a complete waste of money. I learned nothing that I didn't already know. The author also has a preachy, holier than thou style that is extremely grating. I was embarassed to have spend good money on this book."
3,"Long on etiquette, short on rules","I was looking for a book to explain the rules better, and this wasn't it. It went into lots of details about etiquette, tipping, how to play with your boss, etc.. The author expresses lots of personal philosophy about why you should walk, why you should use a caddy, and all about betting. The rules section was a short discussion that didn't elaborate on the USGA handbook much.The stories are enjoyable, especially the one about the Chairman at Augusta National offering to cut a deck a cards for a loudmouth gambler's entire 40 million net worth.This is one to borrow, not to buy."
4,Accessible power on the road,"Finally purchased an inverter to power a laptop and to recharge various battery powered devices on the road. The Xantrex was a nice small unit with enough oomph to charge batteries and run my laptop. This device fits easily in my glove box when not in use.I have already used the device several times and have been quite happy with it.My only complaint, I wish the cord that connects the unit to the lighter port was longer so the device could sit on the floor. Other than that minor issue, great product."
2,warning about motorola phones,"The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone, the phone says unauthorized power supply and disconnects.Works with ipods but I think the Motorola expects a ""smart"" usb port it can talk to and this must not be one."
4,"low tech, so far so good","checked its output. It is a 60Hz square wave generator. That is what they called ""modified sinewave"". Very low tech. However, looks great, space saving and use it once for cell phone fine, but have not check with high power yet"
4,"Quiet, small inverter","Just got it yesterday and used it today for my laptop. It works flawlessly. Some notes on the item: (i) It runs a little bit hot, but not to a point where you cannot hold it. The fan never turn on with my laptop 90W adapter attached and charging my laptop. (ii) The rating is 175W peak, 130W continuous. It didn't say so in the specification. Not a big deal since my car can supply 120W only. (iii) The blue LED is nice but a little bit weak. Should have a brighter LED in place. Am I picky on this? On my car the ciger plug does not ""lock"" properly, so it may get loose and not working. A brighter LED will help finding this out WHILE I am driving. (iv) The inverter is really small at around the size of a 2.5"" hard disk, but of course thicker. (v) No, there is no air plug, at least ""not any more"". It comes with a ciger plug and a clamp core (like those jump start cable) now. Hope these information helps any one who is looking for an inverter."
5,A favorite toy in our house,"My daughter received this toy for her first birthday. It has not really ever been used as a walker, but since the day she got it, she has loved sitting on it and discovering various ways to put the balls in the basket. She rides it everyday now. As other reviews mentioned, there are no brakes and it doesn't turn...my daughter (who is now 15 months old) also has a toddler bike that does turn and she has yet to figure out the turning feature. As for the lack of brakes, babies in this age range shouldn't be riding without supervision anyhow.This is a favorite toy in our house and I would recommend it."
3,Be careful - my niece has flipped over walking w/ this toy,"My daughter received this toy as a gift, and loves riding it. She also likes the ball return - figuring that part out pretty quickly. She isn't using this to walk with yet ... but we keep trying.My niece (who's the same age as my daughter - 10 months) got this a few months ago - and is cruising (walking) all over the house. She absolutely loves it! The only complaint my sister in law has - is that if her daughter is cruising - and this walker hits a toy laying on the floor- it actually flips frontwards, and my niece has flipped over top of it. You should make sure that the floor is clear when they use this."
4,Great Fun!,My daughter loves this toy!! It didn't seem to be to fast for her little legs(as some others noted in reviews). She is 10 months old and loves pushing the pink nose on the smiley face to hear the music. This toy seems very durable and the walk is smooth with the wheels gliding along nicely. Definitely a good investment!!
1,The box is better then the toy...,I recieved this toy as a gift and i was very upset when i opened the box! it is puiny compared to the adds for it and the picture on the box... the wheels move way to fast and my daughter fell and hurt her chin! i returned this toy in 2 days of buying it.. waste of money needless to say...
1,Not Safe,"I've never written a review on an item, but I will on this one. My daughter is about 1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk. As soon as she pushed it into a wall and leaned forward the whole thing almost flipped over. Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there. I don't see how it has such a high rating by other users."
4,Great on carpet!,"I bought this for my 13 month old foster daughter...we were told to get her something that would help her learn to walk. After browsing throughout ToysRUs, I decided on this walker...it looked like it would be really fun for her. For a month or so, she didn't want to have anything to do with it, but now, 4 months later, you can't keep her away from it! She loves hitting the nose and making the music play (over and over again LOL), and she's figured out that the balls come out the back, and she'll spend 30 minutes to an hour playing with this! The only problem we've ever had with it was the fact that it has no brakes, so we had to keep it on the carpet if we wanted her to learn to walk. Now that she's walking, she'll take this anywhere, on carpet, tile, or hardwood. For the price, this is definitely worth it!"
3,"Fun, but not really a walker","This toy is fun when playing with the balls but - do not get fooled by its name - it is so light, it is dangerous to be used as a walker. It goes way too fast and for someone who is learning to walk, it could be a real hazard! We have hardwood floors and after several attempts, I made sure my son does not lean on it. Eventually I had to put it away to prevent him from falling. He is now walking without ever using it. It may be fun to use as a ride on but we have yet to see."
4,A great ride on,"honestly, I thought this was awful as a walker. with hardwood floors, this moves much too fast to be stable. as a ride on, however, it is two thumbs way up. My 2 year old is unusually big and tall, but he has loved this so much as a little ride on scooter. it plays a very cute little tune and is quite durable. we have had it nearly two years and have only replaced the batteries once. a great buy as a ride on."
4,Great fun but hard to change from walker to rider,I bought this toy for my 12 month old daughter who is not yet walking but will be shortly. I thought it would be good for her to have a walker to help her along. But she actually prefers this toy as a rider and she also just loves to sit beside it or on it and push the nose to make the music & lights go or to play with the balls. It amazed me how fast she figured out where to put the balls and where to retrieve them. I never change it to a walker because it really is hard and it really does hurt my fingers. I even badly broke a nail the first time I tried to change it. I just recommend leaving it one way or another and changing it very seldom! I am fine with it as a rider and she absolutely loves it as does her 10 year old brother!!
2,do yourself a favor and don't order,This toy has the most obnoxious song. It plays over and over with the slightest movement.. I have bought many toys and this is by far the bigest wasted of money.
5,Most Printer Friendly,"With the realization that the major printer companies seem to view my Brother Printer MFC 420N as old and not a high end machine, I still use it, love it and have to purchase the correct ink for it. The Amazon listed the ink as Brother so I purchased these. Very happy & completely satisfied with the selection; came fully sealed, ready to use, causes absolutely no bleeding & works fine. Being skeptical about generic products is a major factor in my purchases. Therefore, I cannot afford to have anything messed because of an unwise choice. My printer/scanner/fax/tel/card reader is working fine and I intend to keep it this way as long as I can. Kudos to Brother for continuing to make the product ink number; cannot use any other kind."
2,Luxury but not good for instructors,"It's too fancy and nice, but it is heavy and the handle is long. It is hard to carry around. The handles get hot when playing summer time."
4,Gamma Good,Gamma's high rise gold 75 is the best ball hopper I've ever owned. I've been playing tennis for over 20 years. Gamma good!
4,Tennis hopper a good basic,"It works for me. It's not fancy, serves its purpose. Helps make practicing fundamentals easier."
3,Fun & Gore,"This movie is certainly a classic. While it doesnt have all the big stunts and special effects of todays movies, it brings me back to when I was a kid and got a real scare from ""scary"" movies. This movie is campy and silly but it still made me jump and I still enjoyed watching it."
3,Cheesy but not that bad,"I dont know why this got all the bad rep, its not that bad. its more cheesy then scary. and this movie was made for people over 17 not for kids to see. A young boy sees his parents brutally murdered and gets sent to an orphanage. years later he begans killing people dressed as santa claus, including a ""reindeer"" scene that will have you shaking your head. linnea quigley is in it for less then 5 minutes so i'm sure her fans are dissapointed! All in all not as bad as everyones making it out to be, but its more cheesy then anything!"
2,Unsolved disappearances in the Smokey mountains,Book was in ok condition. Boring read though. The stories were told then updated then updated again I wouldn't re-read.
4,Read it before you go.,"This added an interesting dimension to our trip to the Smokies. The writing style is ala Dragnet, so while it is not high art, it is effective in providing a clear picture of these strange, inexplicable disapperances."
5,Excellent Quality,"This is a very high quality, durable play tunnel. It actually looks better in real life than it does in the picture. I actually bought it not for kids, but for my dog for agility practice. It's very sturdy, high quality fabric, pops up very nicely, and packs away very nicely. The only thing is that because it pops up so strongly, it's a bit difficult to use it as a curved tunnel for agility. Also, I need sew on loops so that I could stake it to the ground. For agility, you will need to either stake it or weight the ends, otherwise it'll roll and fly all over the place. We do currently have it in the house, and it stays in place without weighting it, since there's no room for my dog to get a really running entry into it. For kids, I highly recommend this tunnel. For dogs, if you're on a budget, this is a great tunnel as well."
5,Hours of enjoyment!,"My daughter was almost two years old when we purchased this tunnel. After reviewing the various tunnels being sold, I have to say this is probably one of the best out there. It is extremely durable and easy to store. She even jumps on top of it, and it always keeps its shape."
4,It's like a Breughel painting brought to life with 80s hairdos,"Any fan of Verhoeven shouldn't miss this film. It's not his best by far but his style is unmistakable throughout. To call this film gratuitous is a gross understatement and it's definitely not for everyone. The casting is like a John Waters movie (Susan Tyrell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, etc, etc.) Parts are really stupid and get ready to suspend some disbelief, but it's very visceral, gross, and really funny. The hottub scene anticipates the pool scene in Showgirls, and listen close for some really funny dialogue throughout. The story kid of meanders and the production overall feels really small, but it's more than made up for in outrageousness. It's like a Breughel painting brought to life with 80s hairdos. If Showgirls is in your collection, you HAVE to buy this."
4,Rutger Hauer Exemplified,"Loved it, typically audacious atrocious and ribald. What's not to like about castles, bows & arrows and mid evil...evil complete with rape, pilliage and plunder; and torture and gore!"
4,Tennis Ballhopper,Gift for 10 year old boy. Doesn't come assembled. But material strong and works just fine! Shipped very quickly!
3,"Video of Handles Installed Correctly, Only 64 Balls","Length:: 0:36 MinsThis is a response to the complaints of the handles falling off. I agree with the reviews that say the handles are fine if they are inside the uprights. But the directions from Gamma do not mention this.Also, you will see in the video a full hopper with the lid closed. That hopper has only 64 balls, not 75.Other than that it works fine for picking up balls and holding them. I would give it 5 stars if the instructions were better and the capacity was more conservative."
4,Good value to pick up practice balls,"This Gamma ball hopper isn't as sturdy as the ones at my club, but it does its job for a reasonable price. Drawbacks include a somewhat unsteady stand that collapses if you aren't careful to balance it before you let go. The top closes with a little difficulty, and again, if you aren't careful, you'll end up with balls all over the back of your car. But really, those few extra seconds of care are worth it since this hopper is perfect for practicing serves, one after the other, or feeding balls to your kid without having to stop every few seconds to chase down balls. The capacity seems to be somewhat less than the stated 75 balls; however, it sure beats lining up balls at the baseline and bending down to pick them up. And pick up is just as easy as some of the more expensive models."
2,Nothing against Mandy Moore but...,Do humanity a favor and listen to the orginal versions of these songs.
4,this is Mandy's best cd yet,"I think all the songs Mandy picked to put on this album suit her voice well. The only reason I give this four stars, instead of five, is because of the song Breaking Us In Two - The way it's arainged makes it have a lazy feel to it and it gets boring rather quick.Every other song on tis album i awesome, tho!"
1,Terrible...,"Okay I decided to give this cd a chance because it's mandy moore. OH MY GODS! It's awful. I mean, what was she thinking singing to crap like this? Most of the songs make Mandy's range go WAY too low. She ultimately sound better by singing a little higher. The song lyrics just suck and it's like nothing she has previously sang. Don't buy this cd. Listen to the clips on Amazon, and you'll hear for yourself!"
1,Toilet Music,"Any album that is strictly ALL COVER TUNES of great songs already gone platinum is just asking for a big big can of whoop-arse! Mandy Moore needs to just go away. She's fluff and her fifteen minutes of fame is long overdue. The ride is over Mandy, get off the horse and quit showin off! You're nothing special!"
2,Not 'So Real',"I don't need a perfect score on my SATs to realize that Moore likely had no idea where 3/4s of these song selects resurrected from, but cut the almost-teen idol some slack for attempting to turn a generation not listening onto something more than the affected likes of the appalling Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears. Her aw-shucks style of pop negates the effectiveness [and irony at times] of the originals, but you want to embrace Moore for the deadpan, obvious passion she exudes while delivering it. My grade: B-"
2,Too Many Remakes!,Her remakes were ok but I didn't like the songs that she chose. I think she should have written more songs.Was this review helpful to you?
3,listen before you buy,"hi. i think her voice sounds terrific- really great on this album. but about the songs, well this is purely an oppinion so dont take my word for it, but i dont really like the songs i thought they were cheesy. but obviously mandy likes them and that is what is important-that she does what she wants. i DO like one song and that is drop the pilot that is great.i had heard the song carol king did before and they purposely made it sound off key. ALL im saying is I think you should listen to the album somewhere first. i gave her 3 stars for her great voice which was really impressive, but i dont like the songs. its just that some songs that were written a while ago kind of sound cheesy if you know what i mean. and i do love music from different eras i love 80's. just listen first."
3,Okay,"I liked the old Mandy when she could sing poppy and stuff, but really, right now all the backround music really drowns Mandy out, and u can hardly hear her without a little help by raising the volume for vocals on your volume control. But I have to say her cover of I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE is pretty good, and my favourite has to be HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN ME."
5,My 20 month old loves them!,I ordered these for my little girl to sleep with at night. They are the perfect size for her and nice and soft. She loves sleeping with them and its great that it came with two in case she ever loses one.
3,Should have let the original masterpiece be!,"This re-release of the CLASSIC Bensusan recording, Solilai (originally released on Rounder Records) features updated performances of a few of the original cuts (Nice Feeling and Santa Monica). Unfortunately, the original versions were fresher and more spontaneous and something was lost in the re-interpretation. I lost my original CD and replaced it with the newer version. I wish the original were still available! But, the good news is that his ""greatest hits"" collection, ""Nice Feeling"" on Zebra Records, has the original version of Nice Feeling on it. Check out that wonderful compilation! It is an amazing anthology of truly his best work!"
2,The worst Mk up to date.,"I have to admit I bought this game but, i am no idiot because I was an Mk fan. This game is exactly the same to the ps version but lacks better music and the loss of FMV due to N64 memory. Besides the story in this is quite messed up with sub zero if you compared his story in mk 1. Sub zero also is toned down and pathetic from jumping in not so high places to the ground. This is only for Mk ""sub-zero"" fans. Another thing is that I was able to beat this game but, still it is too hard to be fun ( and no I don't mean challenging hard)."
1,don't buy this game.It is as bad as pokemon snap,"Whatever you do do not ask for mortal kombat whatever.It stays with superman down in the hall of horrible games.Please get mortal kombat 4,or triogy.Please!"
1,MP3 Amputee,"Beware! Four minutes are missing from the Ballad Medley. It should be 11 minutes long, not 7. This is one of the best songs on the album, which is why you can't buy it by itself. So, I bought the whole album only to discover that it's an MP3 Amputee. I hope Amazon will refund my money."
1,Out of Tune,"With all due respect to the other 8 reviewers, I can't listen to this CDbecause the 2 trumpets are out of tune. I am a musician who will never reach the heights of Diz or Roy but.... they should have tuned up better!"
1,Not Compatible with windows 7,"I gave one star because i could not play game.Im glad i only paid $6.95.Thair is a way to get the game to play on windows 7,you have to set you boot advanced options to 1 core every time you want to play game."
2,Kinda like GTA: Vice City,"A lot of elements in the gameplay are very similar to Vice City but then again, a Vice City had a few relations to the original Scarface movie. Differs from Vice City in how much more vulgar it is, bad language and drug use!Not the greatest of games."
3,Only for Saw Fans,"This movie is so graphic even diehard Saw fans would cringe and look away. I did. The question is what disturb state of mine would create for profit or watch for pleasure such graphic mayhem. It's almost like admiring the skill of Holocaust torturers or drug cartel and state supported torturers for their effective outcomes. On the other hand I wouldn't address that question if it wasn't for the effectiveness of the writer and director in showcasing the same skill. Fortunately it got so over-the-top one could put it down as just dark humor.What's the story? Girl grows up a bit disturb by her poverty, a bit of abuse while at the same time getting a bit envious and greedy for what others may have. So, she goes on a killing spree to get the home of her dreams. And, gets away with it."
3,It's ok,"This is a good book for those who are interested in this subject, otherwise it can be a hard read for the fact of lack of interest."
2,Yummy suckers,I love these suckers but half were broken and I couldn't use them. I wasn't able to complete my classroom project with my students.
3,A pleasant but uninspired reading.,"Although a pleasant way to pass the time, ""A Choice of Angels"" is not a great read. In many places it is plodding and predictable. Also the story's message overwhelms the story. It's like a sermon dressed up in a story, rather than a story that may also contain meaning for readers."
5,We all love it!,I first saw this whenever I was pregnant. I told my husband about it and we couldn't wait to put it in the nursery. It even helps me sleep! I love the music and everything about it is wonderful. My son figured out how to play with it last month and has been entertaining himself with it ever since. Just today I saw him playing with it and laughing at it. It doesn't wake him up whenever he's moving around in the middle of the night. It'll go off and I know he'll continue to have sweet dreams. I highly recommend it!!
5,Great soothing crib toy,"I bought this for my 6 month old baby boy. It is very soothing and provides a mild light when he wakes at night. I go to his crib, turn on the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and can see to find his pacifier. He goes back to sleep with the soothing music and light shuts off soon. He is now 8 months old and can turn it on by himself."
4,Very entertaining for my baby!,"My baby loves this aquarium! He didn't really start noticing it until he was about 3 months, but now it keeps him entertained in his crib so I can get things done! The only drawback is it takes 4-""D"" batteries and it goes through them quick!"
5,Very soothing yet stimulating toy,"I paid $65.00 Australian dollars for this toy which is quite expensive, but it's worth it. I didn't buy it to solve any sleep problems, but was just looking for an interesting crib toy for my 3 month old daughter. She really enjoys it. It is visually and audibly stimulating and she could stare at it for hours. Good thing it shuts off after five minutes - otherwise I'd go broke buying batteries for it!"
3,Play time too short!,"I love this product but the play time for the sounds is too short! 10 minutes is not very long but the sounds (which I would love to sleep to) only play for like 5 minutes. If I could improve upon this product it would be to have timing options and maybe a remote to activate it from across the room. I keep having to jump up and reset the button. I love the sound selections and the different functions, however"
1,i dont like this at all,My friend daughters loves this and she said i had to have it when i was pregnanat with my daughter.i really do not like it. its not an intresting toy. she never paid an attention to it. also it eats batteries which i hated too. but i really hated the most that it had no remote system at all. the music only plays for ten minutes and it has no remote so just as she was starting to quiet down it would go turn off and you have to go in there and turn it back on which would make her cry again. i stopped turning at all. nows she is 21 months and she turns it on by her self but the batteries go so fast i had to take it out and i dont use it any more. glo worm has same type of product but it plays up to 20 mins and she likes that one.
1,Broke after 9 days,I bought this toy because I heard that babies love it. I had it for 9 days before the fish stopped swimming. The music is also really weird. This product was definately a waste of money. I don't think I will buy anything from fisher price again.
1,marketing gimmick,"This was a gift from grandma because her sister had given the same gift to her grandchildren. To us, it was just another way to spend money on plactic, cheap junk for kids. There are a few short and tinny tunes that it plays. It is very durable and safe. I hope that parents can pay more attention to their children and show a bit more creativity in their development and entertaining than by purchasing this toy. Maybe this is a toy for parents who are too busy and over-committed to spend sufficient time with their child and shove things in front of them just to keep them quiet. I told my mother what I thought and she was wondering herself, and we concluded that her sister's daoghter-in-laws lied that they liked the gift. My mother returned it."
4,Very Nice Overall,"I think the version I have is a newer version than the one in the picture online. My version plays different types of music and it has several other sounds, such as raindrops, ocean sounds, etc. The music it does play is very pretty. The lights come and go and move throughout the toy very gently. I don't like to leave a night light on for my baby, so I just turn this on, and by the time the lights go off, my baby is asleep and I don't have to go back ant turn off lights. She's only 4 months old, so she doesn't play with it yet, so I can't comment on that. She does sometimes kick the button to make it go on, and it's very easy for her to do. I'd have given it 5 stars if it had the option of having just the lights with no music, so I could just turn on a CD."
4,Soothing,"My husband and I turn the aquarium on in my son's crib when he's being fussy and it helps to calm him down. He also likes flipping the switch to make the starfish twirl and rolling the ball to move the oyster. It's a little loud when the water bubbles come on; too loud, in fact, to be able to hear the music or sounds. It doesn't seem to bother the baby, though. It's a good choice for those nights when the little one won't go to sleep easily."
5,ocean wonders aquarium,"I love this!! I have bought this for a few friends babies, as well. My son loved this right from the start - he is now 10 monthes old and still loves playing with it - and helps sooth him to sleep"
1,dull and boring,I had heard wonderful things about the peaceful planet so when I looked for one this was what I found. It barely interests my baby who might glace at it. The music lasts such a short period and if you want lights and bubbles the pump is so loud it drowns out the music or water sounds. The lights are very dim and the fish barely move. I would not recommend this product at all. If you have any interest try to get a chance to see it working in person first.
3,Motor is too noisy!,I bought this newer version of the aquariam since the fish in our old one got stuck and no longer moved. I like Fisher Prices' older versin of their aquariam much better! It had illuminating lights that my daughter could look at which reflected on her wall and the the bubble sounds were much quieter and more peaceful. I would not recommend this one because of the obnoxious motorized sound.
3,Very pleasant and relaxing.,I actually enjoy the toy more than my two month old but I think as he gets older he will love it too. The music is so soothing and makes you want to lay down and relax. I definitely recommend the toy for babies to help soothe them anytime during the day and night.
1,Wish they still made Peaceful Planet,"I recently bought my daughter this toy after her peaceful planet died, and what a waste of money. The PP was calming and had wonderful soothing bubbles, and the lights on the ceiling were great even for older children. This new version is too loud for anyone to fall asleep to and the motor over powers the sound of the bubbles. There is no lights for the ceiling and the ""interactive"" toys are boring for a child over six months. Fisher Price should have never discontinued the original !!!!"
3,Not for the older infant!,"My son loves this toy, and it was great when he was little. However, at 6 months old he actually found a way to unhook this toy from the side of the crib! I walked in to find it on top of him and he was chewing on the strap! Things could have been much worse, but as a warning to parents: take this toy out of the crib before your child reaches 6 months. I still rate this toy 5 stars for fun though...the music is VERY soothing and the swimming fish kept his attention in the morning so we could get a few more minutes of sleep."
5,Great Product,"This has entertained and entertained our little boy for 6 months - he just loves watching, listening and pushing the buttons."
5,What a CUTE aquarium,"We bought two of these since we have twins, and they BOTH like their aquariums! I like the fact that it actually has a volume dial on it so you can turn it down at bedtime (unlike a LOT of very loud, supposedly ""soothing"" crib toys). It lights up softly and even has bubbles that come up around the fish, making it look like a real aquarium. I think the music and relaxing sounds it makes are the cutest! The very best part is that it will have your baby asleep in minutes or less. With a little push of a button on the front, your baby can turn it on and off on their own! We love ours!"
3,Bad improvement?,"After reading all the negative reviews on the ""new and improved"" version of F.P.'s aquarium, on went online to ebay and bought the Peaceful Planet (the old model). Well, I just got it yesterday and put it in my baby's crib today, and am proud to say he is actually sleeping in it! He co-sleeps with me at night because I am nursing, and I could never get him to take his naps in his crib. He would just scream when I put him in it, even if I put him in when he was already asleep. I did have to turn it on twice because it only runs 7 minutes, but after the second time he fell right to sleep! I'm glad I won't have to put him in his infant car seat to nap like I used to because he'll outgrow it soon (he's 16 lbs).There are always several being auctioned on ebay if you want the old model."
4,"Very satisfied, but.......","We have been very satisfied with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. My son is now 17 months and I left it attached to his crib b/c it would keep him occupied in the morning! One morning I had noticed that he had partially knocked it off, so it was dangling upside down. The liquid inside had started to leak out onto the floor. I don't know what type of liquid it is so I immediatley threw it out. I will definately purchase another one for our next child. I just wanted parents to be aware that this can happen."
5,There are Fishies in my bed!!!,"This toy is wonderful. My 4 month old is able to turn it on and off with it's big blue button. It has a light in it that came in handy for me a few times at night. Just know that when you push the button, the bubbles go as well as the light. I like the fact that it has several settings.My husband dropped this toy onto concrete once. It's fine. Very durable. The bubbles were very soothing to my child when he was a newborn. Its a great crib toy.There is no volume switch on it which is not cool. I also wish that the bubbles would run longer than they do. They only work for about 60 seconds before the toy goes back to sleep mode. I still like this toy a lot though, and so does my son."
5,Wonderful toy for infant/toddler!,"My son received the earlier model of this toy before he was born and he wore it out (I purchased it on Ebay). My mother-in-law bought him this newer model and this is one thing we never leave home without. My son is almost 2 now and he still uses it! In the car when we travel, he holds it in his lap and plays the music/ocean sounds or opens the clam in the scene. I wish Fisher Price had chosen a better selection of music but apparantly my son loves it. I find it a little annoying but if I change it to the ocean sounds, he changes it back to the music. Overall, this is one of the best things that was ever purchased for my son."
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium because it looked very cute and I hoped it would be a bit better than the Peaceful Planet Aquarium. My son used the PP Aquarium for almost 2 years and loved it. The only reason we aren't using it now is the motor seems to be going and is getting loud.If it weren't for the loud pump noise for the bubbles, I would keep this item. However, I'm also disappointed that the volume control doesn't go lower than it does and that the unit doesn't stay on longer. I've tried using it for my 7 month old but she has no interest in it and it's too loud to soothe her to sleep. This will be returned."
2,Bring back the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!,"We bought this for our infant daughter as a replacement for my older son's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. At first, I was pleased by this product's design and the addition of toys for the child. However, when we began using it, we HATED it! First of all, as others have noted, the motor is excrutiatingly loud to the point that it drowns out the soothing sounds. Second, the lights are too bright for use in a dark room when trying to soothe (not shock) delicate little eyes. Finally, the music on this product is too radio-like, not like the tinkling little lullablies found on its predecessor. After using it for two nights, I put it back in the box and returned it to the store. This toy would fall under the old adage...if it isn't broken, don't fix it! Fisher Price really goofed on this ""improvement."""
5,Worth every penny!,"My 8 month has been loving this crib toys since the first day we put her sleeping in her crib at 1 month old. It plays wonderful soothing songs. I love how it allows you to use 3 different settings (music, music & lights, or music & lights & movement).I normally leave it on the 2nd setting(music & lights)b/c it helps prolong the batteries and it will run 10 minutes before it shuts off on setting 1 or 2. I definitely rate this as one of my top 3 baby shower gifts (#1 angel sounds monitor,and #2 aquarium bouncy seat)."
4,Thumbs up on the Aqauarium,My son is a year old and we've had his aquarium on his crib since he was about 4 months old. It wasn't too long before he was able to turn it on himself and enjoy it! I can usually tell when he is awake because I hear his aquarium go on! He even changes the tunes on it. I really like this toy and I know my son does too! I would definitely recommend it. It's a very nice addition to any nursery.
3,Great toy if you don't expect it to last more than a year,"The turning mechanism only lasts about a year. I bought the fish bowl aquarium for my son 3 years ago. It lasted about a year before the turning mechanism died. My son loved it so much that I bought the retangular shaped aquarium as a replacement. This one just recently died on us too. The turning mechanism doesn't work, nor does the light. Now it will only play music.I'm planning on replacing it, but I'm not sure that I'm going to buy another fisher-price."
2,5 minutes??,I bought this item thinking that it would be a wonderful thing to have in my son's crib to help him fall asleep. It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.
3,Could Have Been Made Better,"I think Fisher Price could have done a better job. The first aquarium I had leaked. I returned it for another and this time bought a one year warranty on it. I have only had this one for 6 weeks and the volume no longer adjusts. It stays at the same volume level and it is very loud now. Although I have had some problems my daughter loves to watch it and I think it can be very soothing. When the lights, music, and motion are going at the same time it is hard to hear the music because the motor is so loud.I also think the length of play should be longer. My daughter will be watching it and all of the sudden it shuts off. She is still too young to figure out how to turn it on again. When it shuts off she begins crying and I have to turn it on again."
3,Still using it,"I bought this product back in 2005 for the birth of my first baby. The bubbles stopped working on it,so I was quite disappointed . My daughter is now using it in her crib. And she's 18 months old now. So it's been a pretty good toy to have for the crib. I just wish it would have kept working properly. My daughter loves the lights and music it plays."
5,A great soother,I purchased the Ocean Wonder's Aquarium to help my 3-months old daughter calm down at night and fall asleep. She loves looking at it and it calms her down and soothes her in just minutes. It's a MUST for new parents.
5,Sleepytime!,"My Daughter received this as a present when she was first born, she's 2 years old now and we still play the music for her every night when she goes to sleep. It has an automatic shut-off so it turns itself off after about 5mins or so. It has different songs, sounds and it has volume control. You can also turn the lights on and off so if baby only likes music or vice versa. This is definitely worth the money."
2,not that impressed,"I tried this with both of my children, and it certainly did not allow me to just put them in their crib and fall asleep. My biggest issue with this item is that it can really only be hooked up to the top of the crib railing, which is too far up to really look at if you're the baby lying on the mattress. I tried to rig it up so it was mattress-level, but the bumper pad got in the way. Plus, my kids would either turn it off or on if they accidentally hit the on/off button while trying to play with the other buttons--that should be on the top of the device."
3,Wonder where the bubles went,"My daughter got this for Christmas. It was the first thing she learned to reach for and touch inside the crib. She also learned it was a good method to signal her parents she was awake :)So overall a very good experience, she was lulled to sleep countless times by it. Batteries do wear out quickly.The water filled toy is heavy for its size and the plastic straps are standard crib toy too short narrow straps. It limits your options about where and how high you can place it. If it were still in her crib now I would have real concerns about her yanking it down.Not a problem because the bubbles stopped working by March, not three months gone by. I see they have a new and improved version replacing this one :)"
5,We love it!,"This aquarium has proven to be the best crib toy we bought. Baby loves the songs and bubbles. At about 4 months she could turn in on herself, and at about 5 months she figured out how to spin the starfish and open the clam's mouth. I love that the volume is very adjustable and that the songs are easy to listen to. We did have one scare with the toy though. At about 2 months Baby was napping and got her head caught between the aquarium and the mattress. Luckily no injuries, just a scare."
4,New Mom Learning,"I bought this for my daughter when she was less than 2 months old. We have the Aquarium Swing and the bouncer and she always fell asleep in it. We had trouble putting her to sleep in her crib when we came home from my mothers. I thought because she loved the swing and bouncer and had no problems sleeping she would like this and boy was I right! She watched the fish swim around and the bubbles go up and absolutely loves the music. Every time we laid her down to go to sleep at night and turned it on, she fell asleep in no time. This is a GREAT ""toy"". She's not old enough to roll the ball to make the oyster move or pull on the lever to flip the star, but she still loves it! I gave it 3 stars for education because aside from the above 2 mentioned things...there really is no educational value to it."
2,kind of so-so,"We have had this thing for a while. I have everything from the Ocean Wonders Series. While I am extremely happy with most of the other items, this item was rarely ever used with my son. The music did not soothe him when he was worked up, and it has never once put him to sleep. The fish and clam in it has never been able to catch his attention for more than half of a second. He will listen to the music while I change his diaper, but that doesn't last very long. Maybe the company should try again."
4,Very cute toy....,"My daughter went wild when she saw this at her cousin's house, so we had to buy her one too! She loves watching the lights and bubbles and the music is good too. I do wish that they were a couple more toys on it besides the twirling starfish and clam, but I guess they keep her happy enough! She can easily activate the msuic/lights herself and it does help soothe her at night and before naps, and also occupies her when she first gets up in the morning. I wish they made a similar toy for the car or stroller!"
5,8 week old loves this toy,"I just bought this for my daughter who will be 8 weeks old tomorrow and for her it was love at first sight. I put in on the side of her crib and she just stared and stared and stared in amazement, when the music and lights went off she cried for me to turn it back on. The only complaint I have is that the setting that turns the music lights and bubbles (her favorite part) only lasts five minutes, but I still love this toy!!"
4,Liked the Peaceful Planet Aquarium better,My three year old daughter has used the peaceful planet aquarium since she was six months old. When hers broke we bought this one and she will not take it to bed with her because she thinks it is scary. It's a cute idea and fun but the motor is very noisy. And it is TOO easy for a child to turn on by themselves. My four month old turned it on with her foot in the middle of the night and it woke her up. The other one was perfect. I wish they would bring it back but with improvements so the fish don't get stuck.
2,Too Loud,This toy is supposed to be soothing. The motor is too loud! The music has to be turned up too loud or all you hear is the motor. This could have been a nice toy. The Peaceful Planet Aquarium was much quieter.
2,No Thanks!!!,This toy is not all its cracked up to be!!! Don't believe the hype. My 14 month old hated it! I am bringing it back.
5,My Nursing Bible Through 3 Kids - Including Twins!,"This book stayed within easy reach for me during the 24 months of my life I nursed my 3 kids. The drug index in the back is an extremely useful, unique feature of this book above other nursing books. This means that when you get a headache, indigestion, sinus infection, or have a sore throat while you're nursing your baby, you can flip to the back of this book and find out what you can take to make MAMA feel better... and you won't sit there and wonder, ""If I take this, will it get into my breastmilk and to my baby?"" That peace of mind is huge.I have probably bought this book 10 times for baby showers and friends of mine and everyone agrees this is the creme de la creme for nursing. Hang in there ladies! :-) You can do it!"
5,breast feeding isn't easy,This book is a must have for any first time mom who wants to nurse her baby. It saved me when I thought breast feeding just wouldn't work.
5,Great reference book,This is an excellent book for all nursing mothers.I found it especially comforting and reassuring during my first 6 weeks of breastfeeding. And even now 6 months later I find it to be an easy and informative resource.
4,A good practical reference,"This book is very good with detailed lists of suggestions to try for various problems - blocked duct, underfeeding etc. It is a good reference, but for a more all around comprehensive book I prefer Nursing Your Baby by Karen and Gale Pryor."
1,Could be better,"As a first time nursing mother, I found this book repetitive and the layout confusing, with many ""refer to this section and that section"" references (without page numbers) and little help. Some of the information is out of date. I recommend Jack Newman's ""Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers"" as the absolute best source for a new mom."
1,"Good information, if you can find it.","A reference book is only as good as its index, and this one was terrible! The book contains valuable information for the new breastfeeding mother. However, the index was the worst I have ever used. There would be 10-20 pages sited for a word or topic, most of which only mentioned the word in passing, or not at all. Unless you plan on reading this book cover to cover (and think you will be able to remember everything you have read) find a different book."
1,UNIVERSAL SUCKS,"McMILLAN AND WIFE is a five star show, Universal is a negative 100,000. Do not expect to see any new McMillans from them, this show will have to be farmed out to get released in full. I am so sick of buying the first season of a series only to realize that the rest of the series won't be, like Kojak, etal. Or, you can buy the whole series, one DVD release at a time like I did for the Wild Wild West only to have it then re released WITH the two made for TV movies included and no you can't get the movies separate at this time. Keep ripping us off and sooner or later, no one will bother with your crap."
1,"Great show, lusy DVD","I really enjoyed the parts of this DVD set which I could watch. However, after returning 2 sets because they kept hanging up during the same episode, I finally gave up and asked for a refund. It's too bad the studio that released this DVD didn't bother to do an adequate job of quality control on their product."
4,Warm and Fuzzies,"Thinking about McMillan & Wife has always given me the warm and fuzzies. It reminds me of sitting on the couch on Sunday night and being allowed to stay up. I also had a bit of a thing for Susan St. James. It was one of those good childhood memories. Watching the show as an adult, I'd have to say the writing wasn't great usually, but overall it's fairly entertaining. Overall I wasn't disappointed. Now if they'll just release season two here ($60 for the Canadian release!?). It's funny, all these years I didn't know Sally's MG was yellow because we had a black and white TV."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!,"This was just awful!! I wasted 20 bucks on this. More swearing than any normal person, the main character is an idiot!!! ""Why does naked girl like that guy and not me?"" Dude maybe because he saved her and you did nothing. This Anime has a real bad budget as well. Just awful!!! Get anything else but this!!!! Good concept, Bad anime...."
5,The obvious choice for anyone starting a home based business,"Paul Edwards shares his great knowledge in yet another book to help anyone start thier own business. This book will answer every question you can come up with and answer it in a way that is easy for anyone to understand. This is why it will help you to become successful. I highly recommend this book, it has great tips, information and ideas to help you start and run your own home based business successfully.Michelle Dunn, Author"
4,Dummies -- home based business,I have found this book to be very helpful with questions I had regarding my direct selling business. It will remain on my shelf as a reliable source when other questions arise.
3,"Not bad, some good info",It's not bad. I was hoping there'd be a bit more info in it. However it did have a few things that made it worth buying.
5,A Bold and Sizzling Romance Novel,"Nina Moore is 100% sistah. However, to the world, she appears to be white despite the fact that 1/2 of her heritage is African American.Nina wants acceptance and she struggles to find it.The world questions her identity as an African American woman.Her current man Derrick is color struck and she is haunted bya recurring nightmare.Nina meets Ahmad who has an imperfect past. He's now trying to make good by raising her daughter.A slow deep friendship develops between Nina and Ahmad. They later take their friendship to the next level.Nina's nightmare does not end until she discovers the truth about her past. A truth that will almost shatter Nina's world.Skin Deep is a bold and sizzling romance novel. It delves not only into race relations, but also, intra-race relations within the African American community.I would highly recommend this book."
4,Excellent book!,Very good Kathleen Cross. It took me a few chapters to really get into it. But once I go to know the characters which was after 4 chapter. I was really into it. I like the character plots as well as storyline. Very creative the way you ended the book. I'm also a light skinned sista so I can relate. I cant wait to read your next work. Good luck on next book.
4,Deep,"I am not into romance type books but this one is okay. Despite all of the romance, there is a message behind the theme. Reading this book will make you take a look at yourself and how you may treat others because of a difference. It is a good ""makes you think"" kind of book. Nina, the main character, battles the constant reference to her skin color. She attempts to enlighten those she come in contact with. I especially liked the explanation Nina gives Ebony when Ebony wonders why she is brown and Nina is white-looking. Also, Ms. Cross adds some twists and turns to keep you interested in reading ""Skin Deep"". There is no lacking confrontation in this novel. This is a good book to read because it provokes the thought about why we live in a world so hung up on race. I definitely would recommend ""Skin Deep"" to my friends not for the romantic backdrop but for the message they may derive from reading the book."
3,"NICE LITTLE COLLETION OF SEMI-CUTE STORIES AND JOKES, BUT.....","There are indeed 1,400 stories, anecdotes, witticisms and on-lineers in this work and some, very few, are even sort of cute and funny. The biggest problems I have with this work is that for the life of me I cannot see how the work within this book has any thing to do with country, much less the Ozarks. I suppose there may be a few that relate, but you certainly have to dig for them. On the other hand, there are some nice lines that would indeed be useful to speakers, etc. Maybe this was just my cup of tea, you might quite well enjoy it."
3,Unit worked fine - for 15 minutes,"I was very happy with this unit - for about 15 minutes. I heard a loud pop and all I got was static. All the indicator lights in the base station went out. 24 hours later the unit worked fine again - for about 3 hours. Then a loud pop and the base station indicator lights went out again. Now the unit is completely dead with nothing but static on the headset. I sent Amazon an e-mail, and they are sending me a replacement with free shipping (don't you just love Amazon!.) They say if electronics are going to fail, it usually happens in the first 24 hours. Hope the next set works longer than this one!"
3,Dark Jungle,"The movie was to dark to view.I could not see the Monster clearly.Not too much action, just talking."
4,"an excellent disk, with Jacquet well under control","at his best, Illinois Jacquet was as sensual and inviting as any tenor saxophonist in jazz. It is good to hear the echoes of Herschel Evans in Jacquet's playing. My speculation is that Jacquet influenced Ben Webster as they moved into the 1950's. Partly because there is no squealing this is a 4 star disk because I have to save 5 stars for REALLY GREAT DISKS -- of which there are less than 100."
1,"great fiction-like ""journal reading""","Interesting info on rowing, but aren't there 2 sides to every story? Written like a personal diary -"
4,NFL Blitz,"Great classic game at a good price, love the action and old rosters. Fun to play with guys like Marino"
5,Outstanding foreign film,"I found Before the Fall, to be an outstanding, beautifully filmed story of what happened to young boys and teens under Nazi Germany, when they were chosen for the special schools. Even though the film is sub-titled, you forget about that soon after the film opens. It is told in sensitive tones with dramatic edge. Highly recommend the film as a historical period piece. The actors did their job well."
5,Lots of Fun,"I have a 1 year old and a 2 1/2 year old, and they absolutely love this. We set up the tent occassionally, but they play with the tunnel daily and have a ball. They chase each other through it, play hide and seek, etc. It is some of the best money I've spent on a toy!!!"
1,"Sad, sad , sad!","It is rather sad that someone who sets herself up as being scholarly cannot accurately interpret the meaning of those simple fables. For example, the tale of 'Zeus and the Tortoise' #508 has no connection whatsoever to 'home is best' but, more accurately, that 'there is no God but there is Mammon' or alternatively, 'he who weilds the sword never wears the crown'! There is a profound social message to learn from all Aesop's fables but regretfully many do not originate from his pen but accreted around his tales with the passing of time."
4,Nice Product,"Product arrived on time and in great condition. I am installing Brazilian Teak which is extremely hard. The gun has had a couple of mis-fires which were likely user error combined with the fact that this is extremely hard wood. This gun feels like it is a product designed to be a quality product meant to be used everyday. At the same time, the mag body allows it to be lightweight."
1,Not what I ordered,It was suppose to be vanilla and I received plain and it tastes horrible!!!! Now I have to throw it away and lose all that money!
1,Yuck.,This taste horrible. What a waste of time waiting for the package and money. I will be going back to drinking slim fast which taste 100x better and is way cheaper.
3,Gema,"I do not have any complaints about the seller, it was fast and came right on time. I'm just not too happy with the product, it has no expiration date.I was told that they dont have an expiration date but a bar code, but I dont know if I trust that."
3,Pina Colada,The taste of the Pina Colada shake mix wasn't that good. It tastes better if you just mix the formula and the milk together then add a few ice cubes. But if you blend it together with ice cubes then it does not taste as good. Also it does taste a lot better with a banana blended with it. I would prefer the chocolate over this one. I haven't all the flavors yet. But out of all the flavors I have I think this one is my least favorite.
1,EXPIRED!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ! I GOT THE PRODUCT AND IT WAS A MESS! FIRST, THE WAY IT LOOK WAS VERY OLD AND THE LABEL WAS FALLING APART! SECOND THE EXPIRATION DATE WAS SCRATCH OFF ON THE SIDE AND UNDER THE PRODUCT IN THE BOTTOM IT WAS WIPED OFF! IT WAS SO SUSPICIOUS BUT, UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE EXPIRATION DATE I AUTOMATICALLY JUST OPEN A LITTLE AT THE TOP TO CHECK IF IT WAS REALLY COOKIES AND CREAM! IT WAS BUT, I DO NOT TRUST IT AT ALL WHY WAS IT WIPED OFF AND SCRATCH OFF? SOMETHING FISHY OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING! NEVER GOING TO BUY FROM THE SELLER AGAIN! IF I COULD RETURN THIS ITEM IT WILL BE WONDER!"
4,Much easier to use than a dictionary,I bought this for my 5th grader and he tells me it is much easier to use than a regular dictionary. I know that it is easier for me to get him to look up words he needed to spell than it was when he had only a dictionary.
3,hit and miss,"The movie is definately visually appealing.If you want this movie to make sense you're going to have to work to for it because the movie doesn't give any easy answers. This movie says a lot, about people, life, development, art....I could go on.I was expecting some weird movie with maybe a few good sleazy scenes...I got that, and way more than I expected.Overall I liked it, just don't watch it with any expectations."
1,Something is up here!,"This really is not a good book. It's decent for reference but the fact that the author defines some parameters as ""standard"" early on and then refers to them as ""the standard parameters"" through out the book makes it a bad for looking up quick questions (unless you want to take the time to memorize what he considers standard OR go looking for the list every time). I'm not saying the book was without worth, after reading another book on HTML 4, I went back to this book and it did add some more advanced features to my knowledge, but there are other books that would probably be better.If you do buy this book, I would suggest you skip the first part. It's worthless, and it only confuses you."
1,Defect,"This converter didn't work at all. I didn't dare to expect too much for that price in the first place, but still very disappointing..."
4,Riders Review,Good anthology of their works over the past decades. Easy to listen to - good music while traveling.
4,Vital Information and Review Questions for the NCE and State Counseling Exams,"The content is excellent. My only complaint is with the CDS there are no tracks, therefore you are unable to stop and repeat a section. Once the CD is started you are committed to listening to it entirely."
4,Satisfied with Purchase,The CDs were helpful and prepared me for the exam by providing me with a refresher on basic theories and concepts.
4,A GREAT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT BACKYARD WRESTLING,"THIS INSIGHTFUL DOCUMENTARY SHOWS THE RECKLESSNESS THAT MANY YOUNG WRESTLING FANS PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH IN THE WORLD OF BACKYARD WRESTLING. WHILE BACKYARD WRESTLING IS ENTERTAINING, IT'S ALSO UNNECESSARILY DANGEROUS AND IT ALSO GETS TOO MANY PEOPLE HURT. THIS DOCUMENTARY IS THE FIRST TIME I GOT TO SEE ANYTHING DEALING WITH BACKYARD WRESTLING. AND AS THE FILM SAYS, IF YOU WANNA BE A WRESTLER, YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRAINING SCHOOL, THERE'S JUST NO WAY AROUND THAT. ALTHOUGH IT WAS A MOVING PIECE OF FILM, IT COULD'VE AND SHOULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER. BUT ANYWAY, IT'S GOOD FOR WRESTLING FANS TO WATCH. FOR A GREAT DOUBLE FEATURE, GET THIS WITH ''BEYOND THE MAT''. INCLUDES SPECIAL APPEARANCES BY ROB VAN DAM."
4,Very Good!,"Another German here...If you are intrested in german food, get this book. As already mentioned we do eat more than Bratwurst, so give it a try. The recipes are delicious (personal favorite is the cauliflower sauce).Most recipes are easy to follow, but there are more complicated ones in there as well. I am sure that anyone will find the right dish in this book.Take half a star off, because it is very expensive. I mean, its not like its imported from Germany."
2,Wrong book,"I ordered the book German Cooking Today....instead I received ""German Baking Today""...I do not bake....so this book is useless to me....I will keep it anyway...will give to my mother..."
5,Exactly as advertised ...,"Needed this type of cable and this did the trick. It works exactly as advertised and at a great price and fast shipping, what more could I ask for? Will deal with this seller again in the future ..."
5,Good for now,It works. Thankfully. Nice work. Point A - B very cool. Technology is cool. Give me more! Cool. I really need a job if I have to give a review for everything I buy...
5,great buy,"Arrived on time, adequate quality. price was very inexpensive. Less than twenty five per cent of retail store and I would still have to order it."
5,A to AOK,"Just needed a USB cable with Male A connectors on both ends.Pros: it works, good price, and it's the cable I required.Cons: none so far."
4,Seems to work,"I bought this to see if a used camera worked or not. Although the cable itself seems to work, the camera doesnt. :("
3,A book I read as a kid.,"I read this book as a kid,and I liked it a lot.I look forward to reading it again.It shows what it was like to grow up poor in St.Louis in the 70's."
5,Eye Opener to Employees in America,I think this book has opened my eyes and mind regarding my job and situations I encounter within the last 10 years. I related to so many of the author's comments! This book is a tool survival guide to the corporate world; it gives you a prospective of how your pears think. I definitely would recommend this book! Cheers:)
4,Entertaining read at the right price,"Buy the student edition! It is cheaper than the others and I bet it contains nearly all the same content. Easy to understand, thoughtful read, albeit a bit short. It contains some philosophical questions leaving the reader to answer. It moves at a good pace and is clear, there's not a whole lot of hidden messages. Although I purchased this for school, it is a play that I will probably re-read and ""get something out of"". The only thing is that the picture on the cover on my book is different from the one advertised, so -1 star for that. It's a good read for someone who is newly interested in plays and dramas."
5,Oy Joy!!,"Oy Chanukah! is heard throughout our home before Thanksgiving and continues for a month. It is filled with joyful celebratory music, wonderful stories and thrilling Klezmer. Anyone wishing to relive the story of Chanukah as well as learn how it was celebrated in the shtetels of Europe will enjoy this tape. It is a great gift for a child as well as an adult. I am thrilled from hearing the first Klezmer notes to the last moving poem."
1,not compatible with i phone or other electronics,I needed to extend my usb cable and this does not recognize my iPhone or a few other electronic products. I would confirm with seller it is compatible before buying.
2,Disapointing,"The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists."
3,DVD,Not a lot of extras and the picture quality was a little grainy but I guess I'm spoiled with blue ray. Had the alternate ending I wanted though
4,Awsome....but....,"This is definaately one of the best DVD's around. The options are incredible and both versions are awsome. The only problem I had with the DVD is the fact that it seems like the sound transfer was unbalanced. the dialoug seemed too quiet at parts and i had to constantly lower and raise the levels. otherwise, this is a must have for any movie fan."
1,The Abyss (Special Edition),"So SAD, yet another BLUNDER by the folks who released this version. Like many folks today I now own a Widescreen TV, I have 3 actually. I think all movies released today should be WS Anamorphic and NOT 1.85 or 2.35 LETTERBOX !!!!!Please stop producing LETTERBOX formats, unless the original film was produced in 1.33:1, period !!!"
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover Abyss is the first version of the movie. Get the special 2 disc dvd.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases.
2,DVD flawed during manufacture!?,"I agree totally with most of the great reviews below. However, after buying this DVD locally and now on Amazon.com, I keep getting a defective DVD. It is defective in the fact that it IS NOT widescreen, and it DOES NOT have the extended and regular version of the movie on it. For those looking for these, be aware of this issue. I have no idea how many of these DVD's are like this, but I'm 2 for 2 so far. Mine is going back!Note - this applies to the 1 Disc version of the DVD. Since the 2 disc version is hard to get and high price, I cannot say if that one is good or not in regards to the above issue."
4,Could have been great...,"This would have been a masterpiece if you took away the inane, Hollywoodesque dialogue, and just relied on the visuals. Visually, this film is absolutely gorgeous. It has utterly amazing cinematography. Cameron is really out there with SFX technology, and with each of his films, he manages to top himself. But the plot and dialogue are really lame, and they drag the film down in the process. This film has some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a film. It makes me grimace. I have seen both versions, and while the longer version is Cameron's preferred one, the short one is more intriguing, and the ""surprise"" in the longer one really isn't that much of a surprise (in fact, it's kind of stupid). Cameron's meticulous attention to detail shines through here, and the film has an extraordinary look, but thematically it's very shallow and predictable."
1,Almost bought this one!,Thought it was anamorphic! Thank you guys! Now when will we get the anamorphic version?
4,Read the Book by Orson Scott Card,"The book treatment is better than the movie. For those of you disappointed by the original ending in the movie, the book's is much more believable."
3,NOT A MOVIE YOU CAN SEE OVER & OVER AGAIN...,"Though I'm usually a big fan of sci-fi films, there was something about this one that I thought was missing. Don't get me wrong, Ed Harris is a great actor, I'm just not sure that the whole cast was right for the roles they played. Sometimes casting can make or break a movie. Just take Haunted Mansion for example, those kids were awful actors!"
3,Intersting,"I cannot watch this movie more than 3 times however the first sight was impressive all I can say about this movie : it is a well designed and directed movie , besides its sfx are very orginal and well."
3,A slight book,"This book doesn't quite live up to its promise. I found the concept of his quest to save his heirloom peaches inspiring, but the book lacks the focus and drama I expected. Instead it meanders through the agricultural seasons, without much explanation of, say, the marketing and distribution process, which is apparently the challenge with the kind of peaches he's growing. The book has a nice mood, but after a while I began to feel that he was saying the same things over and over again. I didn't finish the book, which is rare for me."
5,this is my all-time favorite disappear fear album!,"Sonia continues to amaze. This album rocks like Springsteen on Postcard from Texas, has more latin groove than Estafan on Shake It, talks about what matters most on Me, Too and overflows with good listening pop appeal and poetry outdoing any singer/songwriter on the radio today. My pick is Lovesick. It catches you from the start and holds on throughout. This may be a sleeper but when the world wakes up... they'll be glad they discovered this ""overnight"" sensation. Go Sonia... Excellence Abounds!!"
2,not impressed,This book didn't impress me and I have read others of his. I was quite disappointed in it. Wasn't what was expected at all. Wouldn't recommend to anyone( sorry just being honest)
3,Well done,"I brought this book because I was curious. I had really enjoyed and learned so much from Billy Graham's Holy Spirit and desired the same experience from Angels. The book is very detailed and easy to follow. If you desire to know more about angels, I beseech you to buy this book."
4,Do You Believe in Angels?,"I do, but I wanted to see if it was just childhood fantasies or the real deal. Well, thank goodness for Billy Graham who points out that angels are mentioned at least 300 times in the Bible. That was good to know. This book is a nice validation that angels do exist."
3,flashes of brilliance,"The Positively CD, and or Still a Friend of Mine were my first introduction to incognito. An employee of the music store in Atlanta recommended the CD for its urban jazz flavor. I purchase the CD based upon her recommendation. I was presently surprised to here talented singers, and musicians making music. A refreshing change from computer generated drum tracks from New York being blinded with vocals from California by a recording engineer. My favorite tracks are ""still a friend of mine"", ""where do we go from here"", and ""deep waters"". My only complaint would be the CD as a whole. I found myself not listening to the CD from song one to song thirteen because certain songs had a distracting horn section. Simply put I couldn't listen without wanting to skip past certain tracks. Incognito does show flashes of brilliance but other releases such as ""100 degrees and rising"", and ""Beneath the surface"" are better examples of incognito's talent."
4,"Nothing ""lead or cold"" about this movie","These movies, produced so long ago, make great family films with alot of great character actors, action, and funny situations that will keep children laughing the entire time. Unfortunately there aren't too many G rated movies that you can allow the entire family to enjoy. This is one of the funniest."
4,good family movie,"My 6 yr old son loves this movie. It makes for a good family night movie. If you enjoyed movies like ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" and ""Gus"", your family will most likely enjoy this as well."
4,More of an Overview,"As usual Microsoft puts out a quality product. There is a lot of information here and any of it may show up on the certification exams. The COM, TCP/IP & ODBC chapters were a little light, and you'll have to read other books for more technical information."
2,"Even if you are serious about a RETIRED EXAM, move on","This kit is pure fluff. All high level overviews, with little substance. If you want to get an overview of how the Windows ""pieces"" fit together, it just might not be a waste of money"
2,Seems a bit rushed and inconsistent,"Don't use this as your only source for the MCSD exams 70-160 and 70-161. Inconsistencies I found include: The introduction to the book indicates that chapters 1,2,4,5,7,13 cover topics on 70-160 and you can study just those for that test. Yet later they mention that for the Internet and Intranet portion of 70-160, you need to read parts of chapters 3,8,9.Occasionally review questions cover items not event metioned in the book. The CD that comes with the book looks like an afterthought or a good idea that wasn't completed. It has some animations that don't really add much to your understanding of the topics."
2,"An OK intro to the topics, but thin on meat","This book is OK as an introduction/overview to most of the topics covered, but don't rely on it to contain everything you need to pass. If you need a book to get familiar with the Microsoft view of the world and you are not a programmer, this book is fairly good. Probably worth about 7 points if the title was changed to ""Windows Architecture and a whistlestop tour of lots of Microsoft stuff"" or something similar."
2,Prerequisites and requirements not for beginners,"This is not a book for beginning the certification process.The prerequisites are VB 5.0, HTML, Word, Excel, and Access.The installed software requirements to do the exercises in the book are; VB 5.0, IE 4, FrontPage 98, Office 97 Professional, SourceSafe, and Visual InterDev."
4,One of Hal Hartley's best,"Along with Simple Men and Surviving Desire, the Unbelievable Truth is one of Hartley's best films. Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents. The earlier films like this one (pre Amateur, for instance) still have a light touch with the dark edge instead of the dark edge with blacker humor like the later films: for fun, romantic, cynical college-educated Hal Hartley, watch this."
3,The description doesn't match!,"Negative points- It only contains the first 4 episodes, not 8 as mentioned- The is NO second dvd as mentioned, and the extras aren't that good...- The english voice over is just plain awefull, the voices for Yagumi, Ryuk and L ... just horrible in englishPositive points- The figure is just great, the details are awesome- The box art and included landscape to put behind the figure are great- Original japanese voices with good english subtitles- The dvd packaging is amazing as well"
3,Not what I expected,"I heard from Marcia on a Blues webcast.I bought 3 of her albums including her Live Down the Road. It was mainly based on a single review on the album page."" Great sax on the many solos"".. That sax man is awful. Bad notes, phrasing, and amature style. Gator rhythms was not what I expected either. Marcia is a terrific talent we saw in Bay St Louis some time back before the town was blown away. These Albums miss the mark. sorry."
3,"Good Book, Crappy Edition","I've been buying Norton Critical Editions for years, I guess because I got used to them in college, but this will probably be the last one.The paper is superthin and has too much show-through, making it a strain to read the very small, cramped, long-lined type. The text had a surprising number of typos--not historical misspellings left in because they were in Eliot's original version, but outright stupid mistakes that the proofreader should have caught. The cover stock is soft and flimsy and dogeared instantly; the jacket is ugly.I would have enjoyed reading this excellent book a lot more if the physical object itself had been less disappointing. Treat yourself to a nicer edition (which will probably cost a lot less, anyway), and borrow the library's copy if you want to read the critical articles."
5,Instant attraction; I fell in love with this book,Two battling couples confused with their feelings for each other; George Eliot is a genuis. Middlemarch is a fabulous and wicked tale of love and hate but ADAM BEDE still holds my heart as the number one by George Eliot.
5,"A ""REGULAR PEOPLE"" Review","I'm no smarter than you if your reading this review. I thought MIDDLEMARCH was GREAT. DO NOT be intimidated by a 19'th century 800 page novel, it is very easy to read and the story becomes interesting very quickly. If your common folk like me who likes to read good classics pick this up, you will really enjoy it....and keep me updated!"
5,Middlemarch,"This is my all time favorite novel. Eliot perfectly captures, the internal argument we carry within ourselves. This is the third time I read Middlemarch, but the first time with an e-reader."
5,If you are getting married,"Everyone should read this book before they get married. George Eliot is a master at rendering human character. She is a true sympathizer with the human condition, and merciless at the same time. Beautiful."
4,Bruce Rules,I gave it 4 stars because the movie was very good. Bruce saves the day once again. I would tell my friends to order it
5,Ladies and Gentlement put your seats and traytables back!,"Just a minor correction to the person who left an review for the movie on March 24th, it was not in new york city, it was at Dulles Airport outside of Washington D.C. Anways the movie rocked, and is definitly worth the purchase, ah instead buy the whole trilogy. The only minor flaw in the movie is when bruce is on the phone at the airport. it says ""Pacific Bell"" but note, that theyre on the east coast in d.c.? Thats Bell Atlantic's territory, oh well, so prop guys arent the best, but its still action packed!"
4,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST, BUT A WORTHY SEQUEL!","I did not remember the story in Die Hard 2 as well as the original. This made seeing it again a treat, because I did not know what was going to happen. Some complain that it is a ""been there, done that"" Movie, but I didn't see it that way at all. This is a very good action film! Willis is great as the wisecracking cop who is always in the wrong place at the wrong time. The action never stops and the plot twist did surprise me. I have the Ultimate collection and I think that is the way to go if you are into the Die Hard films. Each film comes with great transfers and plenty of extras of two disc sets for each! I found the set for peanuts. Under $15.00 for a 6 disc set isn't bad."
2,Contrive Hard!,"An action-filled yet unsatisfying sequel to the 1988 classic. Bruce Willis' engaging performance as the intrepid John McClane is weighed down by a contrived screenplay and lack of memorable villains. Filmmaker Renny Harlin would fare better in the stunt-filled Sylvester Stallone romp ""Cliffhanger."" Avoid ""Die Hard 2"" and proceed directly to ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) - a superior follow-up that reunited Willis with original director John McTiernan."
3,"""Man them fumes are ""FIESTY""!","I DID like this film, like one of the other reviewers says, ""it's a good rainy day video"". However, did anyone else notice a GLARRING error in the plot? Noooo, NOT the pay phone thing.When the terrorists deliberately crash that airliner by messing with the instruments so the pilot thinks he's higher than he actually is, the plane crashes in a HUGE confligration of fire. Um, 'scuse me but....THERE'S NO FUEL ON THE FREAKIN' PLANE! That's why the pilot INSISTS on landing, because they're flying on ""fumes""! Check it out."
4,UP and JUMPING,"This book had me up and jumping. Pastor Custis, was just like a pastor I knew 3yrs. ago. Mr. Man, chose to follow only his laws, and had forgot all about the commitment he made with GOD. I'm not saying all pastor are like this Pastor Curtis Black. However if your lost your way this book will also help you see your own short coming. I can not judge Pastor Black -but- it sure was funny reading how he actually thought he was doing this for the church. THIS BOOK WAS A TRIP! I don't have a clue, why some women know a man is married they believe he's going to leave his marrage to marry them ""WAKE-UP LADIES.""I'm truly happy sister Black got out of that abusive relationship, because it wasn't go for her nor her dauther...no women worthy of treatment like that. Over all THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOUR ATTENTION.... I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT MASTER PIECE-4 STARS"
3,Give Me A Break,"I wanted to like these characters, I wanted to feel sorry for their stupidity, but all I kept thinking was 'give me a break!' Yeah, we know situations like this one exist - men supposedly of God falling so short. But was this brother dumb or what? And his wife? Oh, but boyfriend would have been out on his behind. The pretense was the daughter, sheltering her from all the hurt of a broken home. The home was already broken. I couldn't buy into this one. Then again, Ms. Roby's choppy telling has continuously left me wanting. Peace and love, Breezee"
4,Readable Real Life Story,"This was a book club selection of our book club. I read it in two days because it was such a page turner. The story is one that I could relate to because it was definitely real life. Although some of the characters were not as well developed as I would have liked, the book was definitely a good read. It was also very well written in terms of choice of words, etc. I highly recommend this book."
4,Lots of Drama,"To me Casting The First Stone is a story that covers many aspects of marriage, choices, actions, and consequences. The pastor of a prominent church has a wife and adoring daughter but it doesn't appear to be enough as he makes one reckless decision after enough that affects his life and his ministry. At times I found myself laughing at some of the drama that unfolded, but I must say by the time I read the last paragraph, I honestly felt sadness in my heart for the pastor. What happened to the Black family isn't anything I'd wish on anybody. They went thru much hell. I don't want to give the ending away but I think it's worth it for people to read, enjoy and maybe learn something from this story."
4,Dark side of the church,Kimberla does an excellent job of presenting a realistic view of the dark side of the ministry. I actuallyfelt sorry for the pastor; I wanted to offer to get him some psychological help.
2,didn't like it.,I thought this book was slow and boring. The characters wre not well developed and I didn't like the author's writing style. The book was amateurishly written. I do not recommend this book.
5,A Revelation,"Kimberly Roby captures the audience with the reality of deceptions that Christians face in today's churches. She depicts how the love and obsession with power, fame,sex, and money can eventually destroy the soul, family, and church. This book takes an inside look at the struggles of a prominent African-American family within the setting of an influential and powerful African-American Church. Curtis Black, a charismatic and powerful minister, is involved in many ungodly escpades that ultimately cost the demise of his family, church, and personal gain. Tanya Black, his devoted wife and first lady, believes in the institution of marriage. Thus, she is empowered by her faith in God to keep her family together despite the many trials and struggles within her marriage to Curtis. This is truly a novel worth reading and sharing by all. Casting the First Stone is a revelation for church goers to behold."
3,I liked the story plot.,I enjoyed the book. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the Rev. CurtisBlack character was not realistic.
2,Casting the First Stone,I chose this rating because I haven't read the book yet. I enjoy Ms. Roby's books. I have a few more that I haven't read yet.
2,I'll Pass On The Next One,"This was an okay read. It took me a long time to finish this book because in certain spots the book was downright boring. I really got tired of Tanya going back and forth on the seesaw trying to decide if she should stay or leave Curtis. And the whole idea of staying in a marriage where the husband lies & disrespects you daily and you know he's cheating but you choose to stay for the sake of your daughter was too much for me to comprehend (I lost interest at that point). Curtis was a terrible person and demonstrated many of the negative attributes associated with ""Black"" churches. This one was okay, not interested in reading the sequels"
2,Disappointed,This is the first book I have read by Kimberla Lawson Roby and probably the last. I was not a fan of her writing style. While the book started off pretty well it went down hill from there. Tanya took forever going over the same things over and over again just to make up her mind to leave her husband Curtis. Then to add insult to injury she kept challenging Curtis when she was alone and he reacted like a nut. At least 150 pages of this book was a repeat of everything over and over again. There was no suspense for me as I finally didn't care how it ended. Although I completed reading the novel I won't repeat this exercise with any of her other books.
5,LOVED this book!,"This is my second book by Kimberla Lawson Roby! I started off with ""Behind Closed Doors"" which was awesome and I decided to read the series! I also wanted to start from the beginning to avoid missing characters and story lines. This book is so exciting and I can't wait to read more! Her books will NOT disappoint!"
3,It was OKAY...,"All I have to say is that this could have been 100 pages shorter. Usually I can get through a book in a day or two. But this one took me like a week. I would read a sentence and then my mind would wander off and I would start thinking about something else. The first half is EXTREMELY boring. I didn't show any emotion (a laugh/a cry/a gasp) until about page 323-mind you the book is only like 360 pages. I ordered this book, Too Much of a Good Thing and The Best Kept Secret so I could read them in order, and I hope that the other 2 aren't going to be as boring as the first. I don't see what all the hype was about...was it because he was a pastor and was big-doin' it with everybody?....YAWN."
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!,"BY FAR THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. IT SERVES AS AN EYE OPENER FOR THOSE WHO GET CAUGHT UP WITH THE MESSENGER AND IGNORE THE MESSAGE. THERE WASN'T A TIME THAT I WANTED TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. TO THE AUTHOR - ""HATS OFF ON A JOB WELL DONE! """
5,Incredible Book!,The MVT process outlined in this book will benefit every organization. MVT greatly accelerates learning. Imagine being able to quickly distinguish the initiatives that are doomed to failure from those that are destine to be wildly successful. Learning in a few months what you previously had not been able to learn in five years.The mountains of examples in the book make it clear that MVT can effectively be applied to any goal.
5,Better than Six Sigma,"When I read chapter four of the book, the differences between the 12-Step Process and Six Sigma became clear.My company has been in the Six Sigma process for over two years now. We have had some good results, but the up front load has made the costs much greater than the benefits. The 12-Step Process is tactical in nature and focusses on a high payoff project. There is no upfront loading.Another important difference in the two approaches is the 12-Step Process emphasizes operator involvement. In our company black belts are expected to accomplish the projects alone or with only minimal assistance from green and yellow belts. If operators are not involved in the improvement effort, they become part of the problem. Also in my experience operators have the best ideas.Low frontend costs and rapid gains through operator involvement convinces me that our company should give the 12-Step Process a try on one big-bucks project."
3,very good light reading,"The story is sound but the dialogue is somewhat disjointed at times requiring some careful thought. Once picked up however the book is not easy to put down. The story depicts a destroyer on the convoy routes of 1942-3 but the reader is not given the sense of time which is necessary to understand the severity of the conditions, this is not another Ulysses."
4,The best biography ever written of Watson Sr,"It is a very easy-to-read book. You find yourself goin' on and on readin' and you can finish the book in a couple of days. I recommend it to everybody. It is very interesting, even if you don't like or have never read a biography. Thomas Watson Sr was such an interesting man and such a succesful businessman that it is more than worth reading this book. On top you get to know a lot of the son of Thomas Watson, Tom Watson Jr and of the IBM history which is as much interesting as its creator's.The only negative aspects are the quality of the paper, which is poor, and the margins, too narrow for the size of the font(a little bit big I think)"
4,We've all heard of IBM,"Very interesting account of the making of IBM. I did not know that Thomas Watson was a valued employee of John Patterson of NCR before being terminated. Well written books documenting the beginnings of giant corporations are all interesting in their own right, this one more than most."
1,Cheap construction,"The light grey PS1 Dual Shock differs in construction from the earlier dark grey (first gen) Dual Shock. These light grey versions have VERY stiff directional pads that make pushing diagonals nearly impossible. The D-pad will click and make noises like a button rather than moving smoothly between presses. For example, if you push Up and Right at the same time, the controller will only register one or the other. Your character in the game will not move in both directions at once, ie diagonally. This isn't an issue if you plan on using the controller for the analogue sticks only, but if you're playing a 2D game or older game that requires the D-pad, you will be in for trouble. Buy a third-party controller or a PS2 Dual Shock instead."
3,Ferry Corsten - Passport to the USA,"Let me say that Ferry Corsten's newest release ""Passport to the United States of America"" is Good, but it just didn't really blow me away. I thought his Passport Netherlands was stronger.Passport USA is solid but never really reaches epic trance status. It gets in the ballpark, but never really made me go ""wow"" for any extended period of time. Plus you're paying quite a bit of money for only one disc of music. I could do without the DVD if the album cost less.There are TONS of other trance/ dance/ electronica discs out there. I would skip this and get Armin van Buuren's ""A State of Trance 2007"" instead."
5,It uplifts the spirit!,"I have been a musician and composer most of my life and, I LOVE this music! I have listened to it for the past 15 years, and continue to be uplifted by its lovely movements of joyful sounds! What ever I'm feeling in the moment, it all turns to sunshine when this music starts. I often dance in the kitchen to parts of it!I've sent it to my teenage grandson and granddaughter, musicians also and they both love it too. What else can I say? A lovely way to soothe the soul and reach higher ground."
3,good story but disappointing film,"this is the story of reincarnation,of sorts.kenneth brannagh,emma thompson,andy garcia and robin williams star.switches from black & white for the story from the past and color for the present.this film definitely has it's moments,especially the story with all of it's twists.it's a mystery thriller inspired by hitchcock.unfortunately the film falls short.the acting is flat and trys to have scenes of humor but that as well falls flat,as these bits are unnecessaary.but i'll admit that i didn't see these twists coming.as i said there are some good things about this film but it just felt like there was something missing.a one watch only,unfortunately,as i had hoped that it would be better."
4,Great Memories...Lame-ish lyrics,"I had this album on vinyl, and thought it was time to upgrade to the re-mastered CD version. The sound is fantastic, the music amazing, as I remembered it, but the lyrics to some of the songs...were lacking. I suppose I never noticed it as a young teen....many of the lyrics...say little, and repeat...say little and repeat...say little and repeat...especially the songs Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know and Hello Goodbye...Flying, of course is an instrumental.That said, the remainder to the songs (well, Blue Jay Way, is a bit monotonous) are classics in every way, shape and form. For me, I am the Walrus, and Strawberry Fields Forever take the cake....but that's just one man's opinion..."
3,"Sadly,the Beatles worst album",Disappointing.Only I Am the Walrus and Strawberry Fields redeem this mess.And this is coming from a diehard Beatles fan.
2,A few good songs but mostly trash....,I wasnt a big fan of this LP but it had its good moments... not many though...I wouldnt recommend...
1,Boring....,Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
1,my reaction,"It's a cunning move that Capitol decided to tack some of the SGT PEPPER-era singles onto the end of the record. So if that's what you desperately want, buy it. Otherwise, spend your $$ elsewhere."
1,"Their worst effort, albeit with some interesting highlights","The only thing that saves this release is the collection of singles tacked onto the British release: ""I am the Walrus,"" ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" are great, but the actual soundtrack songs are weak as a whole. ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" could come up missing from the Beatles' catalog and never be missed. ""Flying"" is a trippy instrumental that fits the feel of the LP, but is otherwise forgettable. Another of the singles included, ""Hello Goodbye,"" is one of the worst Beatles songs ever. Sure it's catchy, but it was a foreshadowing of the throwaways McCartney would come up with en masse during his solo years. Bad sign. The album is exactly like the movie - worth experiencing for a snapshot in the always interesting Beatles chronology, but their least-lasting work. Oh yeah - the title track is neato, if nothing else."
1,second cd's are no good,"I ordered Magical Mystery Tour at a second-hand price. After a minimal amount of playing, it became useless. Unplayable. I will never do this again."
4,better than the movie,"The good stuff starts at track 6 but the first 5 are alright. ""Strawberry Fields"" will take you there.Beautiful and scary at the same time."
2,"SOME GOOD, SOME BAD","HALF OF THE MUSIC IS GREAT, THE OTHER HALF IS JUNK.I DON'T CARE IF YOU REMASTER THE BAD HALF, ITS STILL LOUSY.HERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF THE GOOD & BAD.1. Magical Mystery Tour - GOOD2. The Fool On The Hill - GOOD3. Flying - JUNK4. Blue Jay Way - JUNK5. Your Mother Should Know - JUNK6. I Am The Walrus - JUNK. VERY ANNOYING SONG WITH STUPID LYRICS7. Hello, Goodbye - GOOD8. Strawberry Fields Forever - GOOD9. Penny Lane - GOOD10. Baby You're A Rich Man - JUNK11. All You Need Is Love - GOOD"
5,GREAT CLASSIC CD,"I WAS JUST READING THE REVIEWS OF THIS CD,WHEN I GOT TO PATRICK OF ROCKWALL,TEXAS.HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE BEATLES WERE RESTING ON THERE LAURALS ON THIS CD.THIS GUY HAS GOT TO BE THE BIGGEST IDIOT I HAVE EVER HEARD.RESTING WITH SONGS LIKE I AM A WALRUS,STRAWBERRY FIELDS,FOOL ON THE HILL,HELLO GOODBYE.YOU BE THE JUDGE,BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS A GREAT CD.5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH."
5,The Best Pop Album Ever Made,"Denizens of the Seattle area are long used to seeing me drive around on sunny days, windows open, playing Magical Mystery Tour in my car deck and singing the tunes at the top of my voice. The very apotheosis of Pop. How can you NOT like an album with songs like ""Strawberry Fields"", ""Penny Lane"", ""I Am The Walrus"", ""Hello, Goodbye"", ""Blue Jay Way"", and the anthem of the 60's, ""All You Need Is Love""? Eh? God Save the British Empire!"
3,Upset.,"I have the DVD Anthology from the some years ago and ""I Am The Walrus"" has a TRUE stereo ending.It's like that on ""Love"" and even The Beatles Rock Band.What in the hell happened? I've waited all this time for something good to happen and,well..."
5,Absolutely amazing work,"This album is stuck between Sgt Peppers and the White Album but recently I have begun to listen to this again. THis album contains some of the best songwriting and musical experimentation in their careers. ""I am the walrus"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" are two of John's best work and ""Penny Lane"" is one of Paul's best. Throw in ""Hello, Goodbye"", ""Fool on the Hill"", ""All you need is love"" and the title track and it sounds like you are listening to a greatest hits album. Honorable mention needs to go to ""Baby you're a rich man"" as one of my personal favorites. I agree that ""Flying"" is a bit goofy, but hey, it's the Beatles... they can make anything sound good."
5,Cassadaga,"Cassadaga! This Bright Eyes album is amazing in it's own unique way. Cassadaga has a cleaner sound than Conor's other albums, and it is more instrumental like the album Lifted."
5,Great!,"This did not take long to ship/receive. The packaging was great, and the cd was in perfect condition. No complaints."
4,good book,"I condensed the entire book into one page of notes, and ignored the vocab.The end result was an improvement of about 140 points (70%tile)on my score: although I took my first test raw so this is kind of misleading.This book basically improves one's time mgmt skills, which is crucial while taking the GRE"
2,Not great preparation,"I bought this book with the hopes of increasing my verbal scores tremendously on the GRE. Well, it did no such thing. My score only raised 20 points from a practice test taken with no preparation. Don't bother memorizing the 200 Top Used GRE words because only 1 of them was on the test. Waste of valuable preparation time. Buy something else or read lots and lots of scientific journal articles."
4,It Always Was,"Although Björk's more recent singles have lacked in the number of songs per disc, they certainly do not lack quality. This is the first part of a two CD/one DVD set, and this is a wonderful opener. Of course, the first song is the single itself, the ""Greatest Hits"" version of ""It's In Our Hands,"" and, while many of her fans have complained that it lacks the energy that it was given in its live treatment on the 2001 tour, I find this version to be superior. The second song is a reworking of ""Cocoon"" by Ensemble. This track, the second of Ensemble's Björk remixes, is not as good as the original, but it does bring the song towards a warmer, elctronic climate - a gentle contrast to ""Vespertine."" Lastly, the disc concludes with a live version of ""All Is Full Of Love"" sure to bring you to tears. Overall, this single is not a bad choice, especially considering its the limited quantity availiable."
3,"Legends, outlaws, and rebels","Profiles include the well known: Laura Ingalls Wilder, Margaret Tobin Brown, Belle Starr, Calamity Jane, and Annie Oakley and not so recognized names: Virginia Donner, Cattle Annie, and Pearl Hart. Fiction is separated from fact as some legends are debunked. Margaret Brown was never called Molly. Black and white photos of the women and their times. Drawback: the author spends the first portion of the book discussing western pioneers. She believes their whole purpose in moving west was to completely destroy the Native American culture and people - a bit of a bias."
5,A Wonderful DVD Transfer!,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a marvelous film that actually adheres to historical accuracy. The viewer gets an understanding into what was behind the attack. The special effects, for a film being 30 years old, are excellent. The DVD transfer is five stars. Unless you have no grounding in the history of the attack, however, you can skip the rather mediocre 20 minute documentary.""Pearl Harbor"" is so vastly inferior to this film, it is not even close."
4,Pearl Harbour without the love story,"If you want the truth about Pearl Harbor without the love story, this is the movie to watch.If you want Pearl Harbor with a love story, why don't you watch ""From Here To Eternity"""
3,good but...,"Great cinematography, story and sound design. However, Tora x3 suffers from poor direction and is edited to a snail's pace. The new mix makes the massive amount of ADR jump out and slap you in the face."
3,"A solid attempt, but MARTIN BALSAM? Why not John Wayne","or somebody good? I mean MartyBalsam is OK but, anyway. Wellfilmed and good but someone whoseerved in the South Pacificlike Tom Valentine's buddyEddie Albert (McQ/Green Acres)would have been better. Goodaction and at least this versiondoesn't LEAVE MARSHALL TOTALLY'Out of the Loop'!!!!!!!!!"
5,SUPER! SUPER! SUPER!,THE BEST WWII movie EVER! Highly detailed! Magnificantly accurate! Plenty of action and suspense. Watch one of the biggest historical blunders unfolds before your eyes.
2,Factual to a Fault,"Ever wonder why hollywood directors take so many liberties when making a war movie? In my opinion, this film provides a more than adequate answer.Granted, the attack scene is very well executed, with special effects that are impressive even today. But the rest of the film is dry and soulless. The characters spout dialogue that sounds like it was taken out of a college history textbook word for word.If you want an impressive factual account of Dec. 7 and the preceeding events, then check out the two DVD History Channel documentary. If you want to see an entertaining Pearl Harbor film that is true to the essence of the 1940's, see Michail Bay's Pearl Harbor.Of course, if you fall in between those two extremes, then Tora Tora Tora just might be the one for you."
