1,NOT THE REAL SAXON,"This DVD is from the imposter Saxon band containing 2 disgruntled ex-saxonites. If you want the real Saxon (Biff on vocals), then get the Saxon Chronicles DVD."
4,phone holder,"good product, a little tight on the top...kind of hard to take off...otherwise its a good product!"
2,Not so sweet or savory!!,"I have had this book in my recipe collection for a few years and this mothers day thought to spend the day baking for my mother in law some mouthwatering treats for her special day. So far the recipes are easy but tasteless. I have tried the marmalade muffins, blueberry muffins, banana bread, and sour cream coffee cake. The muffins were just awful and have ended up in the trash, tasteless!! The sour cream cake, well, just as bad. The banana bread is still in the oven and I am afraid to try it at this point!! What a shame to spend all this money for ingrediants and spend all day anticipating a wonderful brunch basket only to have to come up with another idea at the last minute. I am not inclined to try any others that is for sure!! Too bad really, there may be some good ones in here."
1,4th fantom purchased and broke within 2 months of use,"I used to love fantom vacuums, I recently bought one for my office and home, both broke within two months of purchase I replaced them and both have quit again. Never again will I purchase from fantom, ...(the website) of course won't take it back (I guess Wal-Mart isn't so bad after all). Fantom is impossible to get through to. Very disappointed in both fantom and ...(the website)."
1,Such a disgusting anime,When I 1st watched Requiem From The Darkness I had high hopes for an anime show I heard that could actually by scary. To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free).
2,skip this book and buy a more practical one...,"I bought this book and noticed that everything seem really complicated to make. It has fun cultural information, but that's not really practical when you need to cook something! I was looking for an easy to use cookbook, preferably with photographs, and this was most definitely not it. It has you make things from scratch that you could just buy at your Korean grocery store. Why bother?Your money would be much better spent on a shorter cookbook with more pictures. It can be really easy to make tasty Korean food, so why bother with all of this fancy stuff. Especially when you have a full-time job and are coming home hungry! Give me some simple kimchi chiggae anyday!"
5,A magnificent book,"I have been to Korea many times, I love Korean food and have found most Korean cookbooks unsatisfying. They usually simplify the recipes so much that the dishes taste like fast food. The wonderful thing I found about this cookbook is that it has the whole range of recipes -- from easy things to the more complicated dishes for more adventurous cooks. The other thing is this: I always look at cookbooks just before I go to sleep to think about what to make the next day and the book contains memoirs that provide really good nighttime reading. I got Sting's wife's cookbook last year -- which also has information about their family and it was neither interesting or moving as this one is. Plus, the recipes were so complicated that it was completely useless (unless you have a private cook like Sting does and he/she can spend all day cooking!). Anyway, this Korean cookbook will hold an important place in my kitchen."
3,The Desert Prince's Mistress by Sharon Kendrick,"The book the Desert Prince's Mistress was deeply disappointing. The heroine in the story discovers that the hero is really the prince of a small country. Rather than tell this man she has SEX with this man knowing who he was BEFORE telling him--all because ""she couldn't help herself"". The hero does not have the character the writer is trying to persuade us he has because he's attraction for the woman ebbs and flows depending on if she appears too eager...and she's eager. I didn't find the romance romantic and the reaction of his half brother seemed off. Three stars.The Desert Prince's Mistress (Harlequin Large Print)"
5,Snappy Little Bugs that kids love!!!,The Snappy Little series of books are kid (as well as adult) pleasing and this one is no different. Bright colors and fun pop-outs keep kids of all ages entertained. My great-grandson is ready with an EEEEWWWWW! as each page is turned and a new critter appears. Found my first book when he was 7 months old and his rapt attention convinced me to track down and purchase as many as I can. Highly recommend this book.
3,nice for collectors,"Mick Ronson was a great guitar player who died too young. Lead singer/harmonica player not impressive, but I heard the Tridents with Jeff Beck and they didn't impress me either, except for the guitar player. For collectors only! I may never play this again."
3,De LaUnaBella,"I found this book a little slow at the beginning, but once I was engaged, it turned out to be a good read."
4,Memories of Marilyn,"Lots of oldies on this one. We bought it for Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend, but have enjoyed some of the others.... No one has a voice like Marilyn!"
2,New BluRay Missing The Punch,Just watched the new BlueRay version and I must say that I am disappointed. It's practically identical to the previous release. The image is a bit more colorful but not as crisp as say.. A Star Is Born or Meet Me In St Luis. Also the PBS documentary: Judy Garland By Myself is NOT an actual bonus on the BluRay disk. It seems to be completely missing even though it is listed as a bonus on the back of the BluRay cover. Tisk Tisk.
4,Judy looked fabulous!,"It's a typical Garland vehicle, but any pairing of Fred and Judy is sure to be a winner. And this certainly is. The story is predictable, but wonderfully acted, directed, choreographed, danced, and sung."
4,This is an oversized book,"I got this book at the library, and my 2 1/2 year old loved it so much I came to Amazon to buy it - but I didn't look at the dimensions of the ""paperback"" version I was buying and it is HUGE - way to big for a bookshelf, so I am returning it. I think it does come in a regular book-sized paperback, so will be looking for that..."
2,Check this book out at a library before buying,"Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off. Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why. This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub. But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd."
4,Sam Hunter hitting her stride!,"I devoured Sam Hunter's 'Fascination' in a couple of sittings. The hero, Ian, has a tough-as-nails exterior, but we gradually get to see his humanity - he's a great, complex hero who I enjoyed reading. Sam Hunter's talent for characterisation also shines in her handling of the villain - a slimy piece of work, but somehow you can see how the heroine had once fallen for him. The techno-crime theme and is well handled, as the computer stuff is understandable without being spelled out. Its nice that the reader is credited with intelligence, so it reads smoothly without feeling like a lecture. The heroine, Sage, isn't my favorite of Hunter's heroines so far (hence the missing star), but I still enjoyed the story. The next in the series promises to be great reading with a kick-butt heroine!Having read three of her novels, with two more on the way and more in the pipeline, I get the feeling, reading Samantha Hunter's books, that I'm watching a terrific talent unfolding."
1,This book makes you appreciate Chiltons,"With a mix of 94-97 photos and instructions for the 98+ models (and vice-versa) this book is about as useful as the owner's guide provided by GM when you purchase the vehicle new. Very few of the procedures I read for guidance (wiper control module, U-joint, airbag body control module, ashtray bulb replacement, dash panel removal, et.al.) provided assistance. A poor do-it-yourself book... I'm off to look for the GM service manual at a fair price."
4,Too Many Crooks!,"I actually bought this because of the soundtrack which features the legendary Too Many Crooks from Brighton, England. The movie itself turned out to be quite funny. The plot takes some unexpected twists and turns in the style of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch.If you enjoyed those movies, then you'll get a kick out of this one. If you're a fan of Too Many Crooks, then it's definately one to add to your collection."
4,Pretty and solid but all are the same size,"I ordered two in a size 6 and one in a size 7. Received three so far and although the sizes have different numbers on the boxes, they are all the same size. The underside has a little solid bar, so it's not as thick, probably making it more comfortable. The peridots are specks of gems, so I'm not sure they are even real stones. It's solid and nice looking, nevertheless. Hope I receive the 4th, as they are needed as gifts for 4. Worth the severely reduced price only, not regular price."
5,THE BEST GAINER,"I'm really surprised that no one has reviewed this gainer. This one is the best gainer I have tried. First things first, I did not gain weight but that was my fault for being lazy on my daily calorie intake. Why this is the best gainer 1. 60 grams of protein 2. Has creatine 3. Low on fat 4. Serving size is reasonable (152g) 5. 81 grams of carbs!! 6. Low on sugar 7. Reasonably priced. 8. Mix-ability is decent. The only complain I have about it is that I should have gotten one with no creatine cause im trying to get off it. Also, it's not easy to find. You prob better off just ordering it online, got mine on nutrition depot."
3,Smooth!,"The best way to describe Rosemary Clooney is smooth! In voice, in musical texture, and pure pleasure! I have always loved the rich Clooney voice, and here you have the assembly of the very best!This could be your favorite CD! It's one of mine!"
1,Please do not call this thing a Bluray version.....,"This review is for Bluray quality only. Movie itself is a masterpiece. It's on my 10 best movies list. Bluray quality is bad. I have a big Bluray collection......something to compare to. Do not buy this version, wait for re-release."
3,Not as bad as people said it was ...,"Including me! If Jay and Silent Bob had made it, everyone would have said it was brilliant, the problem is the KC bought his ""worthyness"" to the project no doubt and managed to make a fun movie with no worthyness at all! Go figure.I couldn't really see a moral to the story, the science and technology is debatable to say the least, its too long and an extended version is actually sanctioned state punishment in some countries. For example, in Malawi, minor criminals are made to sit though the normal version and then the ""extended"" version for re-offenders.That been said, if you view this film as just a Mad Max on water clone, its good fun and not a bad film.Not enough fish in it though. And too much effort trying to grow stuff. Catch fish instead. Fish is the secret to survival in Waterworld. And solar stills for water."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"It is often said that immitation is the best form of flattery. Well, the directors of this abomination known as Water World must have LOVED 1981's ""The Road Warrior"" staring Mel Gibson (a 5 star movie -- buy that one instead of Water World; and also get a 4 star movie Mad Max, but avoid Beyond Thunderdome because it's not very good). What a bad knockoff of RW! On top of a plagerized script, the underlying plot is unbelievable. The world cannot drown, even if all the ice melts. There are mountains that are 2 miles tall! Think about it! The acting and action were aweful, and the characters lacked any motivation or credibility. Yeah, it is that bad! They certainly don't behave correctly, that's for sure. Where do they get their limitless ammo and fuel. At the rate they burn their fuel and ammo they'd be out of it rather quickly. I could go on and on but this movie was just so stupid and badly done, it isn't flattery to the Road Warrior but instead an insult."
5,"Loved it,absolutely great","I loved this movie,the idea of the polarcaps melting and the whole world being covered by water is not exactly realistic but fun(After all,its not realism what we want from movies)!The acting is not bad at all and the effects dont rely on CGIs or miniatures but full sized ships(Except the exploding tanker in the end).Its worth every penny it costed to make."
2,"great movie, bad DVD","Before I talk about the DVD itself, let me just say that the movie is great. It has great acting, plot, and action scenes and I reccomend watching it at least twice.As for the DVD, don't buy it. Although the movie is worth owning, wait until Universal releases an ultimate edition or at least a collector's edition (they always do)In this review, I gave the DVD 2 stars: 1 for the picture and 1 for the sound (they're both fantastic transfers) but the dvd has absolutely NO special features, which is really bad because a movie with such a huge scale like waterworld deserves some. Wait until the film gets its full treatment on a collector's edition."
3,Just The Movie,"No extras - not even the trailor.I was hoping this release would include the alternate cut with extra footage and showing the Mount Everest marker plate.Picture quality is pretty good but not a touch on the HD release of ""The Searchers""."
2,"great movie, but it's NOT the original it's EDITED!!!!!!!","most people don't like this movie, but i love it. i've been waiting so long to get the extended edition DVD, little did i know that they would just spit out the TV version. i'm am livid about this!!!! I WANT THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!!! why can't we have the original? waste of money."
4,Highly enjoyable flick,"This movie might seem dated to some now 15 years after its release - really an inevitable fate for ALL movies sooner or later - but it's still a very fun movie with a serious message even if the plot/backstory of how the world became flooded is a bit exaggerated. It's interesting to see how people try to survive in this 'Waterworld', especially since there are now no longer any freshwater lakes and rivers and the world is covered by saltwater. It was cool to see the atolls, and people placing such value on items we take for granted, like dirt, or a simple bath. It does require a bit of suspension of belief - it's hard for me to believe that modern-day cigarettes might still be smokeable 1000 years from now - but who knows, with all the chemicals they put in cigs, it just might be possible :P I do wish there had been a bit more exploration of a backstory. If you like futuristic, post-apocalyptic movies, this is for you."
4,Eco-Horror Science Fiction,"Excellent action film of a world submerged by global warming, on the order of the ""Mad Max"" devastation prototypes. The film inspired a popular Universal Studios outdoor action show. It takes a long time to make a simple point, but it is worth the wait for a fan of action films. The supporting cast and extras are terrific."
1,Will not hold a charge - not worth the effort to return.,"Followed the instructions (extremely small print-had to use a magnifying glass to read). All indications are that it has a full charge, but won't run the laptop for more than a few minutes."
2,ONLY IF YOU`RE A GARBAGE COLLECTOR...,"This one looks good, read the synopsis and it sounds like a fine addition to your exploitation collection, so you invest some hard-earned bucks on it and guess what? It sucks, from beginning to end - boring plot (not like we buy these things for their plots,but...), not enough nudity, and the babes aren`t much to look at either. I watched the entire flick w/ the fast-forward button activated after the first ten minutes. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one - the box is the only thing it`s got going for it. And maybe the booklet, if you want to know about more bad movies..."
3,Quick Question,"Does this book has a ""the market plan pro software"" behind of the text book? If it does have one. May I purchase only the cd-rom? Thanks for reading.regarding, Cindy Nguyen"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"By far, this is one of the worst ""academic"" books I have read in my four years as a college student. Harrell and Frazier's use of misappropriate and ethnocentric examples detract from their attempt to teach."
4,more interesting than great poetry,"Quality of poetry is uneven, but an interesting collection. (Standard measured against =Milosz, Oliver, Whitman). Plenty of categories to browse. A different anthology worth having for people who enjoy poetry."
4,Good story set in Colorado,"Enjoyed this book very much. Don't know what happened with the publisher or company that put the book together, but the last 10 pages were all out of sequence. Maybe it was just my copy. But, all in all, a good read."
4,Competing with the Best!,"Bluetick Revenge is the second book in the Pepper Keane mystery series. Following The Fractal Murders by Mark Cohen, Bluetick Revenge is a fast-paced action mystery book about a P.I. named Pepper Keane. Once a dog-napper, Pepper has now taken on the job of protecting Karlynn (a sadistic biker's wife) from Bugg (the sadistic biker :)). The story, however, evolves into something more when Pepper discovers the where abouts of the man who killed Hal and an FBI agent.The characters and their style really seem to jump out at me, more so than other books. The clarity of the messages sent made the book quite understandable. Although there was no mystery plot per-se, this book still kept me hooked.I would highly reccommend anyone looking for a good, easy-to-read mystery to read this."
2,Awful formatting,"I'm sure this is a good book, but it is nearly impossible to read the Kindle edition I bought. No spacing between the words"
1,not the art of war,"this is not the art of war, just notes. Do not be fooled. This book was free and even at free it was still a waste. Do not bother.If your looking for the art of war check out The Art of War by Thomas Cleary, very good translation. If you looking for the best translation it is The Art Of Strategy by R.l. wing."
3,Good to finally read it.,"I was glad to finally read this book, however I was burdened with so much history and ""back-story"" as to who Sunzi was, if in fact he existed. There seemed to be about 33% of the book in setting up of who Sunzi was before we read his first line of teachings.It is great to read his teachings, but all the setup seems unnecessary and somewhat irritating. I already had a pretty good idea about Sunzi and strictly wanted to read his teachings. I think, in short, his teachings could be written in a handful of pages and one could interpret from there, but that is not the case with this version.I would still recommend this friends and family, but it would come with a strong warning about the setup and the seemingly constant commentary, which distracted me from really enjoying his teachings."
2,"Ok, I guess",Not very interesting. I did not like it. Sunzi did a bad job writing this book. Not made for kids or adults. I hate it.
3,Not great,"I was expecting this book to be more interesting than it was. I had just read The Prince by Machiavelli and really enjoyed it, but The Art of War was just less interesting in my opinion. The most memorable part is early on when Sunzi demonstrates his leadership by training the king's concubines to obey the orders of a general. That story is definitely worth a look."
3,so so,"very good item, like all SUnzi products, the quality of the materials give a you a mark of resistence and durability"
2,The art of making a great book unreadable,"I have to agree with the review that I read before I purchased the book. The author really does not know when to shut up. The Art of War and other works from Asia (allow me to recommend Go Rin No Sho by Miyamoto Musashi) really benefit from some perspective and discussion from the translator. I get that. This guy has to interject his thoughts right in the middle of the source work. Often his thoughts are many times longer than the text that is the focus of his ramblings. But don't be dissuaded from taking on this master piece because of this, after a few moments you will learn how to skip the blather (the first quarter of the book and then sometimes 2 & 3 pages at a time) and read the book as translated. On the second read through maybe the third, go ahead and enjoy what our author has to share. His perspective is not bad, but the book is an editorial nightmare."
3,"nice, but not for puppies that chew a lot","this fit perfectly in the crate I have for my puppy and seemed like it was comfortable for her. But I don't understand why it had a zipper when the whole thing is washable. By the second day of use, she had opened the zipper and ripped up the inner pillow (which had a very fragile lining). Stuffing everywhere! Probably better for older, calmer dogs."
4,I'm a dog like the main character,"There are some fly sisters in this movie talking some serious yang - especially the booyaah with the perfume allergy. And the girl who ""had to run through the bushes in her bra on."" She did want it. I give it four stars because nobody ever takes all their clothes off, but I was still interested to the end. the show is funny!. You can buy the bootleg for ten dollars."
3,He knows a little about a lot,"While I am only about 85% of the way through this book let me say that I have found some very informative material. I have also found some VERY VERY wrong information. As a financial advisor turned contractor I am currently in the ""Planning for your future"" chapter and have found some terrible advice. It leads me to believe that although he was a succesful builder and did well that he doesn't know when to shut-up about things he really has no idea about.I have enjoyed the book so far but it really is outdated and needs to be revised or pulled off the shelf so that inexperienced builders do not use his ""past there prime"" ideas in todays market.If you are in the market for industry books then you can do better. There are books out there that are much more current than this one. Buy a specialty book and stay away from the guys that think they know it all."
1,POOR DESIGN,The lid didn't fit on mine and there is no customer service available for this brand. Don't buy Rival crock pots - it's a gamble with no guarantee.
1,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this coffee! It smells wonderful,I thought it would taste wonderful too. However, I was very disappointed. I tried making it stronger, weaker, and everything in between. No matter what I did it still tasted horrible. I would not recommend this coffee. :("
3,I'LL KILL FOR FOOD,"This Argentinian film is another entry in the mysterious virus genre. Coco and Pippi are a young couple expecting their first child who find themselves quarantined in their apartment complex when an unknown virus starts decimating their city. We then meet the other apartment tenants, a variety of stereotypes who eventually become the desperate people we know they would.There are no fancy special effects and the storyline is rather simplistic. Horacio, the paranoid militant, offers some humorous comic relief, and the dubbing is better than average.PHASE 7 offers little new and is often slow but it's not a total disaster."
5,the best book in existence on automobile chassis design,"Mike Costin was chassis designer at Lotus, and also co-founded Cosworth.This book shows, in brief and clear style, how to design a fully triangulated space-frame type chassis that will carry loads as efficiently as possible,and how to design a suspension to give both good ride and good roadholding.If you wish to design a modern day car using a tubular space frame, this book is absolutely essential. It will be very helpful as well to those wanting to design ultralight mileage record or solar cars. Even designers of monocoque chassis will find excellent ideas as to where their load paths should be going, and how their suspension movement should be controlled.Don't be put off by the fact that the book is almost 40 years old. If you plan to build a space frame, find a copy."
5,the open plot,"""Trully brilliant! Absolutely a level above Clancy and Grisham and all the others. What a page turner. I've had to employ extreme discipline to be able to slow down as I wanted to really savor it and make it last."""
1,Diary of a knob-stroker,"Please, next time around, stick to the dribbly clocks and misshapen heads. Reading this is like watching a man with dirty hands operate on your elderly mother, while smoking a particularly foul-smelling pipe, and laughing at you."
3,Inherent poor design but fixable,"I bought a like-new BAP1175 return from Goodwill, for $2.00. It too would not start up. After I looked at it for few moments, I found that a small plastic tab on the upper inside edge of the front door panel had broken off. The tab enables the machine to shut off when the door is opened and allows it run when the door is closed. I replaced the tab with a small screw and used a hot glue gun to make sure the screw did not turn out. The machine has been running for days now with no trouble. Just a thought for those whose machines have stopped running for no reason."
4,Milk Chocolate Frosted Chocolate Almond Biscotti,The biscotti was wonderful! I thoroughly enjoyed this treat!
2,Does not live up to its title,"40 Years ago, ""Running Scared"" was a hit song full of pathos. 20 Years ago, ""Running Scared"" was a great buddy movie starring a dancer and a comic each of whom was also a superb actor.This movie doesn't live up to either, or break new ground of its own.If you want to contribute money to the studio or your local theatre, find a more direct way than spending it on this flick."
1,My schools film department could have made a better film...,"So apparently the films catch was let the actors wing their lines. All I heard was F$#@% F$#@% F$#@% F$#@% the entire film, I felt like I was listening to a broken record. I'm all about action and drama and this film has plenty of it but I feel like all the characters are portraying a bunch of junior high kids trying to sound tough. This is a text book example of writers who cannot write dialogue to save their lives, or careers. Stay far away from this film. Films like these are the reason the film industry is going down the tubes."
4,Complex and Scary,"Good Grief, this thing was kind of like a combination between Crash and Reservoir Dogs, with a whole lot of other things thrown in. In that case it is almost too much to swallow, but it is still worth viewing.This film just starts out nice and easy, until a pistol comes up missing. Suddenly there is a chain reaction that happens in regards to the pistol's past and different reasons people need to find it. The plot thickens, and I mean it gets thick. More and more players come into the fold and the chase is on. A lot of mysteries as many of the characters have interlocking lives that really make for a complex plot. Some wicked shootout scenes in the end and some right vs. wrong and such play into it as well.I am not familiar with Paul Walker as an actor, but from viewing this film he was pretty convincing in the stressful situations that his character was facing. That made it all the more intense and real in my mind. Just hold on to your hat people, because this one is a wild one!"
2,sorry ps3 owners,"i give 2 stars because i luv this movie, but this bluray disk will not play on my ps3 so it was a waste of $32"
2,very one dimensional,"When I looked up this movie on Amazon it had an overall rating of 4 stars, so I thought it would have solid acting. The only emotion the actors seemed capable of (or were prompted to perform perhaps) was frantic anger. Some of the special effects were impressive, but that is really all this movie has going for it IMHO."
2,shower gel,"I like the shower gel, however it was open and obviously had been to someone else. Didn't care to do the hassle of sending it back, same with the lotion and powder I ordered. No, I did not use the product. I will be buying beauty products at a regular store in the future."
3,the spankers,"They have already announced their farewell tour. If you enjoy some humor with your music, I suggest this one from them. Adult themes."
3,theater vs. home format,"This is an awesome movie. The only problem I have with it, as many of you have found with other movies, is that the sound design is made for theaters and not for home viewing-that is that the quiet parts are too quiet, and the loud parts are too loud. Am I ordering the wrong format? Nevertheless, I recommend this movie with both thumbs up for a family viewing!"
5,loved it!,"I not only love this movie, my boys loved it as well. But, it's the ease of renting it online thru our tv that is the best part!! thanks Amazon, keep up the good work!"
2,Blu Ray?,"I am not an expert on Blu Ray transfer, but have watched enough of them by now to judge one from another. I am very disappointed in this new release. The movie itself is one of my favorites. I was excited to hear it was coming out on Blu Ray. The quality, in my opinion is mediocre at best. Usually I am in awe of any Blu Ray release because the picture is usually so perfect and unbelievable. No cigar on this one. It looks like someone took the regular DVD, slapped it into a Blu Ray recorder and sent it to me! Not impressed at all."
1,Streep's dumbest movie.,"This lamebrain stinker is pathetic, illogical, and ridiculous. Streep should be ashamed of this one but she probably needed a payday. Among the many laughable moments is near the climax when the husband miraculously manages to get miles and miles downstream on foot along a rough, cliff enclosed, wild river far ahead of a raft running the rapids. He must have flown, taking his dog with him. Absurd. Then he sets an unlikely trap with barrels on the cliff that Streep rows the raft over to from mid river, then she fishes a gun out of the river with the little boy, a true Hercules, pulling a cable to bring the raft through the rapid water over to the gun. Whoever dreamed up this joke of a film must have been smoking a lot of dope, and made a dopey movie for dopes."
3,Beware of language!,"Bernice McFadden's debut novel, ""Sugar"", is an interesting story of lives of the deep South, 1950's. There were spots where I thought the book was a bit slow. It is also my opinion, that the book could have been written just as well and the story been told without using some of the language and descriptions of sexual exploitations."
5,"WINNER OF OUR ""OSCAR"" AWARD 2002 FOR BEST WRITTEN","Sugar was beautifully written. It was like reading poetry or listening to a song. The language was vivid. We felt the pain Sugar and Pearl experienced. Sugar did things by her own standards. She wasn't afraid to be who she was. If you didn't like it-oh well. However,she did seem to be afraid to be something other than what she was. Joe was quiet, reserved and strong. His love and support for Pearl was a theme throughout the story."
4,Sugar take you back to a time..,"when life was simpler and uncomplicated. And that's what happens to the town of Bigelow, Arkansas when Sugur Lacey sashay's her hips into town. The women are immediately whispering and the men are intrigued. Sugar begrudingly befriends Ms. Pearl and the two become friends - mostly due to the fact that Sugar bears an uncanny resemblance to Pearl's murdered daughter Jude.Sit back and enjoy this tale as the women of Bigelow try their best to oust Sugar from their sleepy town, while Sugar awakens something that's been dormant in Ms. Pearl for many years and Sugar learns something about herself.I'll admit I've had this book for at least 8 years and initially I couldn't get into it. Eight years later I'm glad I gave this book a second chance. If you enjoy the Color Purple or the earlier books of J. California Cooper than you will love this book.It's not an easy book to read - there's alot of imagery used throughout, but in the end you'll be glad you read it."
3,Not gold,"I am going to be a lone voice in the reviews here and say I found this book slightly boring. It was not an easy read and I was not expecting it to be but I had to put it down once or twice, read something else, then come back to it - not because I found it disturbing but because I found it dull at times. I got irritated with some of the characters. Bear in mind I seem to be a lone voice amongst the reviewers so maybe the problem was me not the book. I wouldn't say don't read it but I would say don't expect it to be gold."
4,Sugar,"Very well written and emotionally filled novel. The characters seemed to come alive and were all so different but yet believable. I wasn't thrilled with the ending and what the future appeared to be waiting for Sugar, or the Taylor family."
5,True to 'life' ghost stories!,"This book is a compiling of case after case, story after story, proof after proof, with statements, and eye witness accounts and good presentation. After reading this book, you will have an idea on what will happen after we die, at least that it is not over - not that you will end up a earth bound ghost! :)Another VERY strong book on the same vain and in some ways even more powerful is True Ghost Stories, its VERY well recommended!True Ghost Stories"
3,Ok your not making me to excited,I happen to be a novice ghost hunter and I although this would be a good book for someone who's looking for something to read if your like me and want to take it a step further then this is not a book with to much to tell.
2,No battery acid,It was my fault for not noticing that the battery acid was not included.It like selling a car with out keys you can't use it untill you go and get the battery acid
4,Quality Battery for my 1991 Suzuki ATV,"This battery is the same brand that was in my ATV when I bought it in 1991. It lasted about six years. Replacement batteries I've bought since then have been lasting about two years. I'm hoping this one will be as dependable as the original. The only negative was that it didn't come with the fluid to fill the battery. In my opinion, the battery acid should be included."
1,Replacement defective too,"I ordered this air cleaner, and it ran for 24 hours before totally malfunctioning. I returned it for a replacement and that too was defective after 24 hours. Amazon tells me they won't send a replacement because this is a bigger problem than they initially thought."
1,TRULY THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,"Terrible product. NOISY - even in SLEEP MODE. The unit claimed it came with a remote control - it didn't. The LCD doesn't work properly - when i replaced the filter, then the LCD stopped functioning COMPLETELY _ when i called customer service a woman named LISA who said she ran the entire BIANAIRE operation, told me that the most she could do to fix the unit is to CHARGE ME to SHIP IT to her - before her, the person was trying to fix my unit by reading me the owner's manual over the phone - honestly - RUN FROM THIS COMPANY - instead of shelling out hundreds only to be hung out to dry. THis is truly the worst product on the market - and the VERY WORST customer service i've ever encountered on ANYTHING."
2,NOT BAD WHEN IT WORKS but FORGET SERVICE,"I have had no luck with Bionaire/Holmes (same company) product. They break or burn out few months after the warranty runs out. You have to expect to replace these things all the time. Same goes for their humidifiers. worse yet, I bought a bunch of the consumables (filters, wicks) which are now USELESS since the machines broke. Electrical failures! but if you ever write the company, they will never write back or acknowledge getting your letter. Goes right in the shredder. Recently, Ive tried the panasonic air cleaner and it is great works well, quiet, even on high. So is the Hamilton beach one. They are designed well and works well. BIONAIRE IS ONE BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER ANOTHER! dont fall for it."
1,Poor Quality,"When I first received the Bioaire 1300, about three months ago, it worked fine. The first thing to ""go"" was the display indicating the percentage of the filter remaining (99%, 98%, etc.). When it got to 98%, the display vanished, never to be seen again. The next thing to break (just recently) was ""high"". Now it only works on low or medium. If I try to set it to high, it makes a clunking noise and shuts itself off. I plan to return this lemon, and I will not be purchasing anything Bionaire makes in the future."
1,Have not received the book yet!,I ordered the book mid July and still have not received it. I contacted them thru Amazon and was told they would send out another book and have not received it yet. Not happy!
4,There are no old bold pilots,"I am not sure if this is a travel book, a flying book, or a book towards self discovery. It seems to be a little of each, but not enough of each. As a travel book, I get only a sense of the towns she visits, and the cultures she adores. She gives snippets, and I wanted more. As a flying book, she reveals the most about herself. She is (was) a poor pilot. She set aside her responsibilities as pilot in command and did whatever Doug told her to do, no matter the danger. Her go-no go decisions were terrible, and every novice pilot should learn from her example. As a journey into self discovery, the book was its strongest. How does the spouse of a famous and outgoing person carve out an identity of her own? This was very interesting, and here the author found her voice."
5,revealing and entertaining,"i havn't finished reading the book yet, but this book is awesome! i have like 10 of Galen's books and read most of his other ones as well. its too bad barbara didn't write more books. this book is more revealing than even Galen's books. she is really honest and humorous. an exciting story too."
1,Horrible product,"I owned this unfortunate model for 1 year. The front nob broke off within 2 months. Then last month, the side handles cracked and broke off (probably from the intense heat it generates from the sides). Finally, the machine eventually just stopped cooking altogether. Rival should be recalling this product. Shame-Shame-Shame!"
1,Product should be recalled,"I own this cooker myself. The handles cracked within the first use. I alerted Christy Mercado, the Customer Service representative at crockpot.com about the issue.I did ask for a new liner, as I have had the product since June 2003. I am waiting to see how The Holmes Group will resolve this issue.For now I will say DO NOT BUY this model."
2,Small,"I think the picture shows a single wide wick, but this one came with one of the cross or ""+"" shaped wicks which burn more quietly than the wide wicks. Kind of deceptive since I thought I was getting a wider wick. Also the size is a little deceiving.... These turned out to be ""mini"" candles compared to what we had before. I realize they say ""medium"", but these are 60 to 70% smaller than I was expecting... Guess you get what you pay for. I had paid $25 for the larger one and thought I was getting a steal at $18 for something comparable."
3,Late shipment,Ordered 12 days with regular shipping before my trip but arrived late. It took more than 16 days for delivering an in-stock item within California. I suspect they deliberately hold an order for any regular shipping method.
4,Great price and easy to install,"When I bought a printer last year, I purposely purchased a printer that had separate ink tanks so that I wasn't wasting my money throwing out whole ink cartridges that still had ink left in one color but not another. I am extremely impressed with Canons. It's extremely easy to install, lasts for a decent enough time, and the quality of the ink is very good. Best of all, amazon has the best prices!"
4,Great price and easy to use,"When I bought a printer last year, I purposely purchased a printer that had separate ink tanks so that I wasn't wasting my money throwing out whole ink cartridges that still had ink left in one color but not another. I am extremely impressed with Canons. It's extremely easy to install, lasts for a decent enough time, and the quality of the ink is very good. Best of all, amazon has the best prices!"
4,Amazon's price is not always the lowest...,"I ended up buying from Databazaar for $41 incl. shipping, still a much better pack than the 3 color ones (c/m/y). I could have gotten this one only if amazon will mail out their free super saver item(s) quicker. The charging valet I ordered last time took 5days before amazon mailed it out..."
1,these didn't work in my Canon printer,These ink tanks were not recognized by my Canon MP610 printer. I tried both of them and they were useless.
3,shipping,The product took almost a week to come and the two ink tank boxes were crushed. One of the two tanks is not being recognizedly by the printer. Canon makes a great ink tank but I just got a defective one.
4,canon ink,"Although the wrong item was originally shipped to me, the seller was apologetic and immediately corrected the mistake and all was fine."
2,Don't trust the Amazon compatibility advisor!,"Amazon recommended this as one of the ink packs available for my Pixma MP980, and their compatibility checker verified it was compatible. It's not: the MP980 requires CLI-221 cartridges. Now I'm out $43 for the box I opened, and I've got to go through the hassle of sending the other boxes back. In short, don't trust Amazon to determine the proper ink for your printer: go to the Canon (or other mfr.'s) website to be sure you know the correct replacement cartridges.As you can see from other reviews, this is a common problem here."
3,"They work, just not long enough.",These cartridges work just fine. The only problem with them is that they run out far sooner than one would hope.
3,Canon CLI-8 8 Color Multipack,"While the quality of this product seems appropriate, it was a little misleading to discover that the Magneta & Cyan are ""Photo"". Haven't had to use them yet, so their reproductive qualities are still unknown."
5,Save money and buy online,I love saving money by buying these from Amazon. Great product for some great prices. This is usually where I buy all of my ink for my printers.
2,Machine won't use it,"Got a message from the printer that it couldn't read the ink. Yet it came in a Canon package, fully sealed. I wonder where Amazon got the package because the printer thinks its not the right one."
5,A good buy,"These were shipped promptly at a lower cost than ""big box"". I have purchased from this merchant before and have never had a problem with outdated tanks."
4,"Great ink, but suffers from the usual printer vendor price gouging","Not much more to say than the title. The ink works great, but it's MSRP is about a dollar a mL... which is pretty absurd as far as ink prices go. (Thank Amazon for much better pricing... but still all the printer makers are gouging the prices on consumables like crazy.)"
3,Qualified approval of product,"I ordered the 4-Pack Color Ink Tanks for Pixma printers, instead, I received a brown carton containing 4 separate color ink pack cartons. When my Canon MP 800 printer was out of CLI-Bk and low on CLI-BM, I installed the new CLI-Bk ink tank. Initially the printer posted a message saying that either the wrong ink tank was installed or that it was defective. I called Amazon support and I reported the problem. The support person suggested that I install another color ink tank to see if it was accepted. Following that suggestion, I replaced the CLI-BM ink tank. After that, the printer printed as usual.Prior to this experience, I had ordered the same ink before, received a 4-Pack bundle, installed each tank at different times with no problems at all. On those occasions I would have assigned a 5 rating, but with this experience I have down graded to a 3, because of the time consumed in dealing with the problem."
3,Canon MP830 printer ink,"My husband insisted on the Canon printer because it's supposed to print better quality photos. What we didn't know was that we had to get Canon photo paper; it will not print correctly on Kodak or other photo papers. That aside, the printer ink colors are OK, but the printer goes through more ink than any HP printer I've ever owned. The ink is fine, the printer just seems to run out too quickly, particularly the cyan and magenta colors."
1,Not an original ink,"This is NOT an orignal ink, and the package I got is NOT the same as shown in their picture.It works fine, so I would not bother to replace it."
3,It works. It's expensive. It works. It's expensive.,"I hate that I have to pay so much $$$ for ink (Canon, are you listening?) with kids in the house who seem to print everything they see. Tried a place called Cartridge World instead, saved $10 on the 4-set, but the MP500 printer knew the difference- it wouldn't even scan :(Anyway, Amazon is $4 cheaper than Fry's sale price, with no tax, and free shipping. The least outrageous of the outrageous, I guess you could say. And I can save an image of the Amazon web page with the price, circle it in photoshop, and add ""This stuff doesn't grow on TREES, kids!"" and use it as the background for my imac's desktop.They'll probably think it's cute and print it to show their friends. . ."
5,Best value for real Canon Ink I have found,"I have the Pixma Pro9000 printer, use it for printing large 13""x19"" photos and also when I need some high quality photos fast. I have looked hard for 1 year for deals on this ink and the best deal is this 8-pack, which has all the colors this printer uses. When Amazon has a sale the prices get even better!"
3,too pricey,"I do not reccomend buying these cartridges. They are rediculously priced. Buy the remanufactured ones on the net for 25.00 for two complete sets. Thats what I do now. Canon, its just water based ink, stop overcharging people. Its called stealing."
3,2 cartridges were defective,I was very happy with the purchase until I had to change one of the colors and the cartridge was defective.So I feel I was shorted one cartridge and will I encounter more damaged ones as I use them up.
4,Good price for OEM ink,"This is a good price for the OEM ink cartridges. The shipment was received in good time and in good condition. I haven't used the cartridges yet, but I anticapte that they will work fine."
4,Works for PIXMA MP800R,"One reviewer suggested this bundle includes a PGBK ink tank, but it doesn't. (That would have been a screaming deal!) So if you own the PIXMA MP800R, you need to buy the PGI-5BK ink tank in addition to this bundle. Otherwise, this is a good deal. Even though I used ""free"" shipping from Amazon, they arrived in about 4 days."
5,best words: minimalism,"another reviewer used the best words to describe this series: Minimalism. A drama done in a very different light. I personally was glad we had 11 episodes of X-file case styles--I love the setting it sets up. I like that the characters are uncomfortable with each other, unsure of each other, stilted in their conversations. These are a group of extraordinary young people selected to hunt the supernatural, not the Young and the Restless.The series does an excellent job of not rushing the plot, and of making us slowly care about the characters even as the characters slowly care about each other. There are great subtle moments, as the heroes and villains are turned on end until its hard to tell where good and evil begin and end, which is real life."
4,book review,I really enjoy the stories at the start of the chapters. Though the chapters can get long over all a good book with many useful facts.
2,Doesn't flow...at all...even for a casebook,"This casebook feels like it's just a bunch of random cases that are typically irrelevant to the topic in torts the editor is presenting. While I understand there is a lot of blending in torts among the various theories, it feels as though the editor does little to really distinguish them. There is usually little explanation (even for a casebook) either leading up to or following the cases. It often feels like the furthest outlier case is used to create a ""rule"" with little attempt to synthesize it with the other cases in a section, making it difficult to parse out what the editor is really trying to say/show, or what the theory actually posits. Overall, this book is one of the most unorganized, confusing casebooks I've had the opportunity to deal with."
2,The conversation/music format is not what I expected.,"This CD has a lot of fine jazz from two great artists,but a band of conversation lies between each band of music so dont get this for easy listening background music unless you plan to program your player to play only every other band."
3,Interesting but slow,"Having read ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"". I thought I should check out Garth Stein's other books....although this book is interesting and relatively well constructed, it is an earlier novel and not as good....not at all bad, but not a book one would say is a must read...however, enjoyable."
2,Sizing is a big problem,"I tried them on in a store, then ordered on-line, as several people had suggested. The size that fit perfectly in the store turned out to be too big. I was about to order them a size smaller, but then I read all the comments about the sizing inconsistency. Since I have to pay for return shipping, and I don't have any idea whether a size smaller will in fact fit, and the color choices in my size(s) are pretty much nonexistent, I am just going to return these. Disappointed!"
3,Very confortable,"I purchased my crocs and liked them very much. However, keep in mind they run bigger than your actual size. I had to buy a new pair 1 size smaller so I won`t look like a cat with boots!!"
4,classic clogs,"got these for my husband, we travel a lot to places with much water. they will be good for beach and pool, only bad thing they are a bit too large, but he likes them"
5,awesome of course.,I wear an 8 but bought a 7 for a tighter fit. I realize the point is that they fit big but the size smaller fits perfectly.
5,Love them,I love them for the simplicity and ease of wear. They are so comfortable when I just need something to slip on and go to the store or just to do something simple around the house like taking out the trash.
1,Poor Quality & Size Problems,"Over the years I have fallen in love with my Crocs. I have two pair, one made in China, and the other in Bosnia. The fit great and have served me well. This pair (made in Mexico) does not fit, they are too big. They also feel thinner and even the straps that normally just fold up out of the way are not the same size. If this is the new Crocs then I will find another brand and shame on the company for ruining a good product. If these are counterfeit, then shame on the supplier. As always Amazon's return policy is quick & easy, however I will still be paying $5 shipping. This is the second time I have ordered a clothing product from Amazon suppliers and the quality has been very sub standard. In the future I will purchase such items locally and restrict my Amazon shopping to other categories."
5,Perfect,Shipment was very received it in less than a week.Size was right not too big it fits perfectly.Came sealed and brand new
5,Fits great,"This pair of Sperry's is the second I own. Both are made of great quality and has lasted me long time. Just be sure to know the size that fits you and Sperry sizes tend to be a bit big, based on my experience."
5,Very comfortable,"I have been using these to walk to and from our showers, and as shower shoes, out here in Afghanistan. Even walking over the rocks that we have alll over the place out here, they stay comfortable and hold together. Excellent cushioning.My only complaint is that if i wear them just hanging out around the tents they seem to make my feet sweat more than normal.Other than that though, they are wonderful and very durable!"
2,Just Ok,"I am a woman who wears a size 10. The length is exaxt, and while I do understand the sizes were unisex, these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot. My foot slides side to side in them. I also thought there would be at least a 1/2"" lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole, however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel. There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe, and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in. The strap can swing frontward or backwards, however when it's backwards, it barely touches my heel since it's so long. It's not as cushy soft as other crocs I've tried on. They are something to kick around in, but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store. I think I will stick to the ones made specifically for women."
3,PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DELIVERY,DUE TO MY RECENT FOOT SURGERY I NEEDED THIS ORDER DELIVERED IN AN EXPEDITED TIME AND PAID FOR SAID DELIVERY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WAS NON-RESPONSIVE. SHE COMMITTED TO RETURN MY CALL AND IT HAS BEEN ALMOST TWO (2) WEEKS WITH NO RESPONSE.
5,Easy casual shoe,"These shoes are great if you are looking for very casual, comfortable, shoes that can get wet and dry quickly. My wife hates the style, but sometimes you got to go for function over fashion."
5,Crocs On Sale got to love 'em.,Everyone should own a pair or two. I purchased the 10M Mens and I have to say they are more size accurate then the older crocs I purchased 2 years ago. At first I thought I'm going to have problems wearing them but they were just as comfortable as the original. Both size 10M crocs side by side the new crocs are both narrower in width and shorter in length.
5,great shoe,I bought these crocks for my husband who loves them. He wears them outside at the pool and also while working in the flower beds. He loves the fact that he can just hose them off.
5,JUST WHAT WE WANTED,"IT CAME IN TIME AND WAS ALL WE WANTED, THE COLOR, THE SIZE NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ORDER ALL OK"
5,I'm wearing them now,"These are crocs just in caseyou weren't sure and clicked on something and they mistakenly brought you here. I'm wearing them right now and they're comfortable as s***. Seriously. Get them! Don't even worry about all the comments and judging family and strangers will pass. It's not important. Do you know what is important? Your comfort. I care about your comfort, I want you to be comfortable. Do you now what will make you feel nice and warm inside? Mothereffing crocs! I actually bought the as a christmas gift and the receiver LOVED them! You will too. I promise. I would never lie to you. I love you."
5,Greatest sandals,"These are the greatest sandals I have ever bought. They are comfortable, lightweight, and durable. Everything you might ever need."
4,Fast delivery,"The product was just as described. Only issue i found was that the size was rather large, after reading other reviews i found that crocs are apparently made from different manufacturers so there is no clear mold for the size. Other than that shippment was extremely fast, i'm currently deployed and shippment to the APO address was faster than expected."
2,bad shoes,"Shoes were not delivered very quickly. Upon examination, they were two different sizes. Returned them for exchange, the new shoes lasted only a few days before the strap broke. Not happy."
3,A bit too roomy,"I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, and first ordered on product recommendation to go up a size, to women's 9. Wrong way, folks. So after returning and getting an women's 8/men's 6 I still am sliding around in this pair. They're still way too wide at the heel end, and about a half-inch too long. I do think a women's 7 would be too small and am tired of returning. So I'll keep them and just be very careful going up hills and stairs. Wish they still made crocs in Canada!"
2,Fat ugly crocs,"This was my first pair of crocs, planned to use them for gardening and expected to find them very comfortable as per reviews and friends' opinions. There are very wide - the box said roomy fit or some similar word. They are supposed to be M but are quite wide and I have narrow feet, so my feet slip around in them, they are bulky and with the red, I look ridiculous in them but do wear them in the muddy garden when watering etc. Disappointed in the fit."
5,Love crocs,These are great and wonderful price. Crocs hold up for more then a few summers... I like this chocolate color more of a darker brown then it looks in the picture.
3,CROCKS CLASSIC CLOG-Comes very Large.,They look as pictured. But as so many reviews they come TWO (2) sizes large. I wear a men sz.9 ordered 8M/10Women and were too big. I should have ordered a sz. 7Men. I will return them and get the 7M size. Will update when i receive the replacement. Read the feedbacks. Most of it is usually correct. I went with the sizing on the site.
5,Good Filters,"Fits perfectly. It would be nice if it came bundled with the carbon filters. they need to be purchased separately. Not sure how the machine knows it got new filters, but it does. Some clever application of Bernoulli's principles. :-)"
3,What a Headphone,FIrst off I thought that this near littler cheap headphones were great but they are really uncomfortable to wear to say the least. Plus they don't even stay in ones ears at all. I had to struggle to just to keep them in my ears. When listening to music or videos I had to push them in to just to hear the sounds.So I really wouldn't recommend this prodjuct to anyone.
3,Attache and Windows 98,"The device works fine with my XP and W2000 machines. It does not work at all with W98SE. The tech help was useless via email. And you cannot contact them live in Parsippany. W98SE just cannot find the drivers that are supposedly installed during the setup program. Oh well, 2 out of 3 is fine I guess..."
3,Like vintage wine,"This one gets even better with age. Earlier reviewers have said Beck says nothing new. If you really think about it, it's never a matter of saying something new. It's a matter of saying something true. Finding Your Own North Star is full of truth - and of ways to help you face your own truth. This is one book I keep coming back to and sending my coaching clients to. If you are in transition, Martha knows how to point the way. The exercises take time and each one is worth the effort."
4,One of the better self help books,"I read this book a few years ago and have recommended it to several of my friends who are or have been in a similar position as me of wanting more from your life's work. While it may not change your life, there are definitely things I took from it and still remember today, such as your inner self (or social self, whatever you want to call it), will always know when you're headed down a path that is not right for you. If you learn to listen to your body, you will find the path you were meant to be on."
3,Which way is North?,"While I admire Beck for her life coaching skills, this book left me frustrated and feeling like I received a knock-out punch, seeing a bunch of stars. I had such high hopes for this book due to the author's success, but it fell flat and did not more me any closer to finding my true North Star.While it didn't do it for me, I'm hopeful that it helps you find your way."
5,A ground-breaker,"Of all the books I have read on the subject (dozens and dozens, Kate White, SWZ, Ban Breathnach, I could do anything if only.., do what you love and... ) this is, by far, the very best.this one really digs into you to find, in every aspect of your life, what is truest to your essential self. You learn how to use your inner compass to make the best decision at any given time, no matter how small the choice."
5,Offers a valuable perspective,This book provides a different perspective from the old positive thinking books that have been regurgitated over the past decades. In my book it stands amongst the ground-breaking books that have pioneered valuable paradigms -- namely Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self (in any situation) and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (passing from personal leadership to social effectiveness). Martha Beck's concept inspires personal expansion.
2,Marketing Book : Seminars won't help at all !!,"I am not sure if these Reviews are from 'Paid' people butIf you atteneded any of her seminars from Learning Annexe, you will find out that she is basically selling you $6,000 seminars using this book. I have been to one of her seminar and it is all confusing and it will sure confuse you. BUT , if you pay $6,000 , you will know what Martha beck is saying.I was conviced that this is 'NOT' what you expected from her book or seminars.Keep away from this Stuff, there are lot of useful / helpful people / books on amazon. Her seminars are so confusing that after spending 3-4 hours , you will try to find out 'What I need to do ' ?.You are paying for her 'Marketing Ideas' by buying this Book..Keep Away ,"
4,DVD treasure,"Upon casting my eyes on this dvd at my local Blockbuster Video, I thought I would get it to view ""the event"" from different perspectives.What I didn't expect was to be so brought into the storylines that time just stood still.I immediately went to Amazon.com to order for my home collection.I immediately and highly recommend this and also remind all who view to first set your English subtitle option on your home player so you can fully experience this dare I say masterful work.Thank you to all who made this film possible."
4,Fantastic. This guy can do anything!,"How rarely we encounter an artist who is truly eclectic in their musical talents. This guy knows how to tug on his listeners hearstsrings in a gentle, quiet-room and hard drink kind of way, but that's not what this album is about. This album is just Ryan having a blast recording well-written tunes that pay tribute to late 80's/early 90's alt-rock. There are few today who can match him lyrically, and his melodies are once again upbeat and catchy. If you're looking for Ryan Adams at his most sincere and intimate, this isn't your ticket. But if you want to have a good time, a record you can blast in the car, that DOES get better with every listen, pick this up pronto."
3,It's Good BUT it Ain't The Best,I appreciate this album and what he does on this album BUT I was really longing for what Ryan Adams is really great at.....mello.
2,Wallflowers meet Nirvana (at their worst),"Does anyone remember Semisonic? Well... they're back. Errr wait no, they're not. It's Ryan Adams latest, and who could have thought of a more inappropriately titled album? I am a huge fan of Adam's Heartbreaker and his Whiskeytown discs, and this is something very different. You may have noticed the title of this review and asked ""Nirvana?"" Adam's himself claims that this album has some Nirvana-esque influence. Picture this, Jacob Dylan's voice cracking along side a guitar that has enough feedback to make the White Stripes sound produced. The verses are thin, the choruses lacking. None of the lyrical genius I witnessed in Heartbreaker.P.S.Rock n Roll?Where did that come from, this is just a pop album."
1,I think I found the 'B',I think I found the 'B' that (B)Ryan Adams has been looking for.This is terrible stuff.
4,"Not the usual Ryan Adams CD, but damn good stuff.","After hearing all the hoopla surrounding this album and it's conception, I had mixed emotions when I popped this one into my CD player. I figured because Love is hell was essentially shelved for not being ""accessable"" in the record company's view, that this CD would be largely a rushed attempt to satisfy the drooling record execs. This may be the case, but to my surprise, it's a very good CD. The alt-country is all but gone, replaced by upbeat rock songs. But, this is not a bad thing, because the integrity in the music remains, and the songwriting is brilliant, as always. This album actually contains some of Ryan's best songs, and it definetly has a 80's modern rock feel to it. As a long fan of Morrissey, The Church, The Cult, etc, etc, I find it highly entertaining. Definetly one of the best of the year."
2,What is this?,"I love Ryan Adams. I have all of his music. I just got this to basically complete my collection, but this SUCKS. This is not good at all. Don't waste your time here. Go buy Cold Roses, Heartbreaker, 29, Love is Hell, Gold, Demolition, or Easy Tiger."
4,Ryan shows his roots,"Do all of you think Ryan Adams is just an alt/country/indie musician like on the Whiskeytown stuff and his first two albums. Well, he isn't. Look at his background. He grew up in rock n' roll and punk. This album is amazing. I love the straight-up rock n roll. It's about time somebody played rock n' roll again. This album in my opinion is his best, because i knew he had this in him. I like the other albums also, but I was hoping he would do an album that showed his roots. This album does show his rock n roll roots, and his album with Jesse Malin under the name of The Finger ""We Are F*** You"" shows his hardcore punk roots. If you say you are a Ryan Adams fan and you don't like, you aren't a real fan, because it means you know nothing about his background."
2,Spliffs and riffs....may not always mix,"Let me preface by stating that I am of the opinion that ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Gold"" are two of the best rock n' roll statements yet issued this century. This album, however, feels rushed and oddly disconnected, relying too much on Strokes-style repetitive riffs...I believe I read somewhere that this album was recorded as a quick substitute for ""Love is Hell"", and it feels like it. There are a lot of big choruses here, perhaps in homage to the alternative 80's, but still the proceedings never really transcend into greatness. There are some tracks that almost make it, like the ""Boy""-era U2 stomp of 'So Alive', the Smiths melancholy of 'Anybody Wanna Take Me Home' and a bit of that haunting quality that spiked ""Heartbreaker"" can be heard in 'Luminol' and 'Burning Photographs', but thats about it. That leaves 10 more largely forgettable tracks. Take heed, you're not getting anything approaching vintage Ryan on this one."
3,Adequate,"This is heavily focused on C programming in the Windows environment. The information is decent, but if you want to use Unix or Linux, etc., you will need something else to supplement."
2,"Another ""charming"" book for high school readers","I bought this book after reading a very positive review in the New York Times, especially since I thought a lot of Rosen's book, The Talmud and the Internet. What I got was a book appropriate for a ""sensitive"" 10th grade Jewish girl or a Jewish grandmother. (By the way, I am Jewish.) Given the significant number of well-written books, it is somewhat distressing that a clunky book like this is treated as adult literature. There is an audience for this book, just as there was an audience for Barry Manilow records. If Barry's singing touched you, you likely will enjoy this book."
4,really good and underrated,"this mouse is better than you'd expect...5 buttons, and it is pretty comfortable. rubber sides and buttons make it nice to hold. the wheel is NOT awkwardly placed; it's perfect for users who use their index finger to use the wheel, and i don't see how it's any worse - it clicks, the window scrolls. acts like normal. only gripe is that it DRIFTS...like the mouse is still, and no matter what surface the cursor drifts to the left/top of screen...annoying, probably a lemon since ive never read anyone else having that problem.all in all, if i had one that didn't drift id give it 5 stars. easily competes with the best of mice."
1,I ran into a problem,"I rather liked this mouse, until I had to use it all day: severe persistent pain in the first joint of the finger used for scrolling. So, back to Mac Mouse."
4,Straps can be tricky.,"The straps can be a little confusing at first, however once you get the hang of it, it works great. Would like to see a wireless version."
4,Fun Little Toy,"What you see is what you get....an 8"" little dog that makes farting noises when you squeeze him. Great companion to the book. Is he a little vulgar.... yes. Does the character help foster the love of reading (with the book)... yes. My boys love him so he made his way under our Christmas tree this year. Honestly, his novelty wore off pretty quickly. However, they find him from time to time and crack up all over again. Walter was well worth the purchase."
3,Makes the book more readable,Loved the dog and the reading was enhanced by her playing with the dog as I read. Love Walter!!
2,Cooks unevenly,"I just received this as a holiday gift and tried it out with pancakes this morning. While I love all the space (I could turn out 8 pancakes at a time!), I was very disappointed in the cooking surface.The griddle surface heats unevenly, so that my pancakes - instead of a nice even golden brown - were a sort of gradation from golden to slightly overdone. Later I looked at the bottom of the griddle and saw that the heating element makes one loop around the bottom surface, which explains the uneven heating.I've never had an electric griddle before, so I don't know if this is normal. It's still an improvement my small stovetop griddle, but I'll be keeping an eye out for a replacement with better-distributed heating elements."
1,A Total Waste!!!,Don't even bother buying this item. What about non-stick don't they understand? It is one of the worst things that we have ever bought. The only thing that actualy works as advertised is the grease trap. Save your money.
3,Mediocre at best.,"I took my initial EMT class with the Brady text... very in-depth and full of information (and about twice the size of this one).This one seems to be very dummed down, with about 1/2 the info. Adequate for an EMT class, but it doesn't exceed the curricula in any area.So, its average, and could use some padding."
4,Caveat Emptor,"Warning to buyers of Ruttmann's ""Berlin:"" many copies are lacking the original soundtrack entirely, and this version does not have the one by Edmund Meisel (who also composed the music for Eisenstein's Potemkin). The VHS by Kino Video also has Brock's score, not Meisel's (of which only a piano arrangement seems to have survived). The European TV program ARTE broadcast in 2007 a re-orchestration by Berndt Thewes of the Meisel score: we need to have this on DVD, please."
2,book review,"I ordered this book for my 11-year old daughter, the content was not too mature for her. However, the cover shown online is not the cover on the book that I received. The pastel colors with butterflies was appropriate, the blood-dripping dagger hovering over a white flower all against a black background is not appropriate. I do not judge a book's contents on the cover, but I would not have purchased this for my daughter if I had seen this cover. She won't pick up the book because of the cover and is afraid of the content even after reading the introduction and cover information. I am a disatisfied customer."
5,More mailbox,This mailbox is definitely heavy and heavy duty. We replaced an old rusty box with this beauty and painted the pole and all looks like new. Now here's hoping the vandals don't think it looks good enough to try to destroy!
5,Nice heavy steal mailbox,Very well made and heavy with nice powder coat paint. Much better quality versus standard sheet metal mailboxes. We'll see how well it holds up against snow plows this winter. Should hold up well against abuse and weather.
5,I thought that it was the second best book I ever read,"I have read it many times, it is a very good book.I think it is the best of all the ""STAR WARS"" books(besides Slave Ship)"
3,psychization as colonization,"I enjoyed Harding's insightful and profound and yet readable style and her excursions into the Jungian perspective; her historical sense was also enjoyable. However, speaking theoretically, the Jungian tendency which came ultimately from Freud and which she shares, namely to reduce psyche to a rarefied, neutralized, ""psychized"" form of instinct, troubles me.Perhaps we should see through this to the heroic fantasy below: the pioneer and missionary out to colonize the wild natives. Where there was instinct, there shall consciousness be."
2,A Handbook With No Index,"The utility of this Handbook is greatly diminished by the lack of an index. The book quickly goes over the head of a newbie, with Chapter 4 attempting to explain how to write code for a ""port"" before this newbie succeeded in getting FreeBSD to run the numerous ports available on the FreeBSD CD. Newbies should look for a more basic text, with an index."
4,Great Little Bluetooth Headset,"This is the best bluetooth heaset I have owned. Pairing is quick and simple, voice quality is excellent. The size and fit are amazing. I was truly impressed by how small this headset was, yet it fit inside my ear. If you are worried about it falling out, there is an optional ear loop that comes in the box. The only negative is that outside noise and wind are easily picked up by the sensitive microphone, but that is pretty standard for a lot of bluetooth headsets."
2,"If this is the best, the others must be REALLY BAD!","My ears must be different than most others. This thing would not stay in my ear even when using the ear loop. The headset kept losing it's connection to my Treo 700WX and required a soft reboot of the Treo to get it to work again. Every time I talked on it the person on the other end experienced an echo. I was very disapointed as most of the reviews are very positive. To be fair, I can't use the ear bud type stereo headphones either, they just don't fit my ears. Also, other people have been having trouble with other bluetooth headsets with the new Treo 700WX. So, giving it the benifit of the doubt, I gave it a 2, but I was leaning towards a 1."
4,The war within the war,"If nothing else, this book gives a new appreciation of Eisenhower as ""chairman of the board"" and the conficts he faced with and amongst his leading generals. Ike was a master manager in balancing the egos of Monty and Patton, and getting the best from each. Irving used the private, unpublished letters and diaries from many sources, claiming Patton's Papers had been ""sanitized"". He goes into the extraciricular activities of Ike with Kay Summersby and Patton with Jean Gordon, his wife's neice. Irving shows the personal relationships with the generals and the staff, such as Everett Hughes long term friendship and advocacy for Patton. While David Irving is politically incorrect these days, this work is very good and worthwhile reading and shows what a good author can do with dispelling myths and writing history."
1,Came with a chip...,I bought the Rival RO200 20-qt programmable roaster. It came with a large chip in the insert pan. I called rival customer service and they said that all they could do would be to send me out a new unit. They said I would have to pay to have the old unit shipped back and also pay to have the new unit shipped to me. This amount is almost 1/2 the amount I had paid for the unit in the first place! ug. What kind of pride do they hold for their product??
2,Not sure about this mouse,"Looks good. I like the rubber grip a lot. I feel mislead becasue I thought it did side scrolling with a roller tilt (the packaging suggested that). Not the case. It scrolls side to side only after clicking down the center button to change the function of the roller wheel. Worst problem for me is that it is physically heavy. Feels solid, but I feel like I'm pushing a weight around. Too much mass to get moving. I bought it to take stress off my wrist. Now it feels worse. I'm bummed because I wanted to like it."
5,...INCREDIBLE,"44 CALIBER BRAIN SURGERY, GELLID REMAINS AND INFECTIOUS HOSPITAL WASTE ARE THE BEST THRASH METAL SONGS EVER WRITTEN. THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS AMAZING. IT'S A SHAME THAT A BAND OF THIS CALIBER IS NOT MORE POPULAR. I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THEY ARE STILL TOGETHER. I HEARD THAT THE DRUMMER VINNIE DAZE DIED. WHAT AN AWESOME BAND. BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,Disappointed,"We had read with interest the review from another person that gave the movie one star, and still thought we would try it ourselves. The movie is set for wide-screen so you miss most of the action. The acting is below average. We just returned from Pompeii and looked forward to seeing some scenery of how Pompeii looked prior to the volcano, but the setting was not of Pompeii. The plot was good and with good acting and directing, the movie could have been interesting. As it was, we cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,"NOT ""The Last Days of Pompeii""!!!","This movie is NOT the ""Last Days of Pompeii"". I thought it would be a movie version of the Book. IT IS NOT!!The book is wonderful. This movie is trash compared to the book!! Why did they not make the movie follow the book???"
3,More nutmeg than tea,"Not too sure about this one. I like the original green tea. I'm a massage therapist, and I have to be sure any perfume I wear is very subtle, even in a small room. Green Tea fits the bill, but it disappears in a few hours, and is a little TOO subtle in the real world.Spiced Tea, on the other hand, gives a sharp spice accent right up front, and takes a while to wear off. The first scent is pretty much Celestial Seasonings or Stash Tea Chai. Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon. No sweet tea notes like the original at all. I do like the scent, but I feel like I spilled pot pourri on myself.Now, if I do a spritz of each--one Spiced Tea, and one Green Tea, then I get a perfume I really enjoy. It lasts longer than Green Tea, but is not as sharp as Spiced Tea. By the time the green tea has worn away, the spiced tea has mellowed out to pleasant base notes. Just right for a night out to dinner."
1,Purdue Boilermakers Boot Slipper,"For a $30.00 slipper, one would expect better quality. The upper portion of the slipper was excellent but the sole of the slipper was made out of a cloth type material that immediately wore out in a fully carpeted home. If you want a slipper that will last you a couple of weeks it's great but don't expect a season keeping your feet warm."
1,the worst movie ever!,"This movie was done by people from Conn.who do not know the diff,between Redneck,and Hillbilly.as a matter of fact,it would appear that a friend had a camera,and said lets do something stupid,and sell it.The southern people for all the world sound like northerners tring to sound southern with no practice,How hard can it be?One of my fav.movies My Cousen Vinny,that was well done.Whoever did the cover art for the dvd case had some talent,but thats where it ends.one is the lowest score you can give,or this would be in neg.land.This should be one of those dollar dvds in the checkout line at Walmart,and even then its overpriced."
5,Sweet Chocolate - Relive the 70's and Get your Groove on,"Hot chocolate, definitely had the Disco Groove going on. Let the band and Errol Brown bring you back to the 70's hayday with groovy tracks such as ... You Sexy Thing, So You Win Again, Every 1's A Winner, Get Down On It amongst others. If you like Hot Chocolate this is your fix for the complete album.Get It and Get Down!"
1,split after a month,"Do not blame Amazon for this product its not there fault.First I will say it does spray quit well, but lets end there.after a 45 days it split down the handle and leaks like a good one, and I can not return it.it does not fit into the coned shaped holder properly and keeps falling down on the swivel.The hose is just some cheap and nasty rubbish thats only flexible when hot water goes through it.Waste of money,"
4,Sober Story.,"Not the best for very young children, because a fox dies, this book is a meloncholy story in the beginning. It makes you see what Ereth thought like. Good book to read eventuallly, but for readers who can take it. a good story about a good deed."
2,The Roots of Management Science,"This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system. This was the beginning of the ""scientific management"" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book. The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time. He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success. Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources. The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers."
1,Phrase,"I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term ""nigger in the woodpile"" in quotes or not does not ride well with me. I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout."
3,IT'S HIT OR MISS WITH THIS ONE,"I have purchased 4 and two immediately started making a clicking noise and I'm having to deal with the manufacturer -- not good. The two that work are fan(no pun intended)tastic. Judging from the other reviews, you might want to think twice about this brand."
5,Great book on neglected battle,"Perryville has been pretty much ignored by Civil War historians except for Kenneth Hafendorfer's poineering book and this one, which is newer, better researched, and has better (but far fewer) maps. Professor Noe has pretty much written the definitive account of this fairly obscure battle. It covers, besides the battle itself, all of Bragg's campaign in Kentucky, from the viewpoints of generals, soldiers, and civilians alike and his views are reasonable, unbiased, and well thought out. Additionally, he writes well and the book was a real joy to read. Highly recommended."
3,"Fair History, Undermined by Dimestore Psychology","Braxton Bragg's campaign into Kentucky in the late summer and early autumn of 1862 is an often neglected chapter in Civil War history. Noe's book is a thorough exploration of the campaign based on use of primary and secondary sources. While a solid account, the author's digressions into retrospective psychoanalysis are a bit silly and lessen the credibility of the book as serious history. Nevertheless, it is worth reading. Like many university press histories, however, it is degraded by poor maps. The award of three stars is just a little bit generous. It's really a two and a half!"
1,Disappointing product,"We've tried numerous times to cook recipes in this crock. We use a Rival cook-book especially for their products. None have ever come out right. It does not get hot enough, and the lid leaks moisture out. Even on the 4-hour (high) setting it still takes almost 8 hours to cook a big roast. We have an older Rival crockpot that works perfectly, and my mother uses a 3-year old crock that works perfectly too. But no such luck with this one! And Rival's warranty is worthless. It would cost us as much to ship the crockpot back for replacement as it would to just buy a new one. And we WON'T buy another Rival this time."
5,I Love it!,I purchased this product a week ago and have used it everynight. I must admit this is my first crockpot but I can't say enough about it! It cooks evenly and the programable timer is a must. I leave for work in the morning and a perfect dinner is waiting when I return. I never have to worry about coming home late because it shuts itself off!Run to the store or use Amazon to buy this product today!!!
4,Lettermen All Time Greatest Hits,Brought back a lot of memories of our family in Japan and the fun we had there. Hope our kids feel the same. Thanks
5,Ursula scores again!,"This time, the Siren Queen is Mary Stuart, former Queen of France and Scotland. Once more, the woman spy for Queen Elizabeth (and now we find out that Ursula,born to one of Queen Anne Boleyn's handmaidens,and who never knew her father, is told by Cecil and Elizabeth that Henry the VIII was her father, making her Queen Elizabeth's half sister!. Ursula must find a way to prevent a ""capture"" of Mary Stuart so she can be returned to Scotland to work up an army to come back to England to remove her cousin Elizabeth from the throne and seat Mary Stuart. Those who want Elizabeth brought down do so because they do not feel that Henry's marriage to Anne was legitmate, which would make Elizabeth illegitmate. But Mary Stuart has her own problems. Want to know what they are? I suggest you read the book. Just remember that these books are based on real history. They will catch your imagination and hold on."
1,"It isn't ""Lovely"" by any means","Just because the main character is dead doesn't make it comparable to Alice Sebold's book. I wanted to love this book, the 1920s New Orleans setting really appealed to me. The plotting was contrived, particularly the idea that a ghost would write letters to track someone down. The denouement was laughable. Frankly, a real let down and a waste of an afternoon."
3,Just OK,"Some interesting ideas in this novel, but overall misses the mark that The Lovely Bones was able to hit."
5,"Amazing, moving & engaging story","This was an excellent book. The author deftly moves us from past to present to tell this story of human emotion - of love, loss, personal turmoil, exuberant happiness - and engages us to search for the answers with the characters. The interweaving of plot through time is remarkable. I could not wait to get to the satisfying end of this book, yet I did not want it to end. I actually re-read it. This book is a keeper."
1,Fox Searchlight's people: take note this BD doesn't work,"Lot of people and journalists think this is a great movie, so I bought it. Well, I bought the movie but I couldn't watch it actually. Doesn't work in my Blu Ray player, as others reviewers here and a couple friends of mine. What a shame people, fix this at once. And send us a standard DVD copy please, The original's copy buyers are decreasing in the world, at big steps rate, take care with us or we have to change the team."
3,Good B movie,"Good B movie, my ex girlfriend comes to life in this one. I could have wrote my story myself but he beat me and wrote this movie. Missing the giveaway of her actually being with someone else or maybe I have to watch it again. Not easy to watch as a movie and way too long."
2,This was a gift,"This was a gift for my sister in law who loves this movie. So for that reason I guess it's great, but I watched it and I wouldn't buy it. I will never watch it again. So, before buying watch it."
4,Great movie,"A very touching storyline. Very realistic. If you liked the Clooney movie: Up In The Air, you'll like this. This movie reminded me of that one."
2,disappointing,"The male lead in this film has no personality. Boring. Nothing memorable happens in this film. Would not recommend this film at all. ""Yes Man"" is a better film that contains Zoe Deschanel"
5,video,i am very satisfied with the arrival of the video I wanted and the condition it was in - Thanks Amazon!!!
2,This movie was a stinking piece of shit,"Title says it all. I hated everything about it. From the stale acting, to the shit writing, to the crappy music. Worst of all, the stupid narrator. God, I hate everything about this movie."
2,"Same story, different clothes","I'm a big fan of Zooey Deschanel in ""New Girl"", the genius comedy by Liz Meriwether. So I thought I""d check out another of Zooey's works. Unfortunately ""500 days"" is a rewrite of the age-old ""belle dame sans merci"" with a few strokes of color and music for added interest. ""Summer"" is a cold, distant, yet exciting young woman who easily captures the misguided passion of Gordon-Levitt's character. As she sends him mixed signals, he becomes more smitten, until she suddenly breaks up with him. The end has a redeeming twist in which Tom realizes that he wasn't exactly the attentive lover that Summer needed, and their chemistry wasn't all that perfect either. Save for that flash of clarity, the rest of the movie is a sickening ride through the angst of unrequited love, which I didn't particularly enjoy. I'll be sticking to Deschanel's more flesh-and-blood, lovable character ""Jess""!"
2,Meh...,"Wasn't bad. But wasn't great. Wouldn't watch it again. Didn't have anything that stood out to me that would be watchable again. It was so forgettable for me, that after I rented it, I remembered I had already seen it. I watched it anyways because I spent money on it. It wasn't fun to sit through twice."
5,not your typical love story,"Great movie with a different ending. if you love Zooey Deschanel, you will love this movie.The cast works well and there is lots of humour as well as romance."
3,entertaining,"I enjoyed the movie, and was surprised at the end. Very different, romance type story. The acting was exceptional, I will watch it again."
4,Not the typical love story!,"In our country (U.S.) we always expect movies to begin and end in a certain way. What makes this movie is the fact that it ventures away from these expectations to leave us wondering why or what if. If you're looking for an interesting movie, I think this is a good one to pick. It has funny moments, sad moments, and awkward moments. Everything all rolled into one and it moves along pretty quick.Definitely recommended...."
2,This is Boring,"I never connected with any of the characters. The professional reviews for this movie were good, however when I want to stop watching a movie half way through this is not good. This movie is not worth two hours of your time.Don't waste your money on this."
5,"Great Movie, Slow Shipping","This is one of the sweeter, more intelligent romantic comedies I've seen. It's well-written and well-acted, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is incredibly sympathetic. It took about two weeks from the ship date to reach me, which was longer than I expected, but I'm pretty sure the seller noted that it could take up to 20 days. It arrived in good condition and in the original case, with a protective plastic cover on the top of the DVD. I haven't tried to remove it because I don't want to mess around with trying to wash off sticky residue, but I did some research and found that it's possible to remove the cover and clean it up."
2,I didn't like the story in this film.,"This movie had all the makings for greatness and a fun movie experience, except that in the end, it became academic, a self-help guide to getting over a relationship with a commitment-phobe who took advantage of the generous heart of an individual who proclaimed with his whole being that he was in love. It seems criminal to indulge in a relationship and lovemaking when in your heart you know that you can't see your life going forward with the person. To glamorize and romanticize this in a film was just sad and disappointing. Too bad. There were so many moments in this film that I just loved. It is filled with wonderful detail and sweetness. I particularly loved the Hall & Oates dance sequence. But for all of it's goodness, it is overwhelmed and washed away when this film ends with a train wreck and the story's shabby attempt to substitute the mess with a patchwork rainbow."
5,I feel the pain of everyone...then I feel nothing!,"This book could have been about me, but without the driving. I could not stop crying as I read the last pages. I felt the author's pain as my own. Her Annie is my Michelle, and I wonder how many others like us are out there. I am numb again as the memories crash in. ""The Drive"" is a lament for love lost. I loved it!"
1,Very disappointing!,"I loved Trisha Todd's performance in ""Claire of the Moon"" but I found this book to be very disappointing. If you are looking for insight into the making of ""Claire of the Moon"" don't look here, there is very little, and nothing worthwhile. I found Trisha Todd's writing style meandering and completly without focus. The parrallels she draws between her ""drive"" to Iowa and her self-realization are obvious after page 2, by page 100 it is ridiculous. Her relationship with Annie seemed self-absorbed at best. I had to wonder what the pull was that kept the two of them together. By the time I finished the book I had no respect for Trisha or for Annie. I had to give this book one star because I did finish the book, but only because it is less than 200 pages."
1,Anachronism of the Year Award,"A bland book with little of interest, unless you work for a government department in a third-world country. Reads like an academic treatise from a second-year student in 1990.The ideas are trite and lack substance. For example, ""dealing with poor performance"" is discussed in a single paragraph. ""Long term incentives and share ownership"", too, is glossed over in a micro-paragraph about trends with nary a reference to shareholder value and rewards.This book is an excellent example of the lead-lag chasm between American HR practices and Europe's archaic thinking."
5,Funny and Wonderful,"I could not put this book down. It was hilarious and casual, and I loved it. Flannery Culp is very funny and precocious and it is great to read the journal questions at the end of each section. It is one of those books I liked so much that I'm not quite sure I want to share it with anyone else."
3,Interesting but Disappointing...,"While I did enjoy much of this book, identified with many of the insights and appreciated the premise the story dragged a bit and I found my mind wandering. Anyone else notice that the surprise ending was almost identical to that in FIGHT CLUB? Interesting...Also having lived in San Francisco 1/2 of my life this book was sadly lacking in atmosphere or description of the City by the Bay - didn't even FEEL like SF."
2,"Yeah, stick to TSoUE","DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT *MAJOR* SPOLIERSI like Daniel's writting, don't get me wrong. But this book was just very confusing. I understand that Natasha wasn't real and everything but then how was the basic eight the basic eight? If Natasha didn't exist then wouldn't there only be seven people? And Natasha got a ticket to the play Hamlet, there were eight tickets and eight people got them, how did an imaginary person get a ticket to a show? And who took the picture? Who was the other person in the basic eight? Don't tell me Flora was cuz thats not true. In the begining they let Flora come to one of their dinners. Jenn writes ""the basic eight"" and then adds Flora. What is going on? I think these things should have been explained. Does anyone else have a hard time understanding what the hell went on in this book? If you do know what went on e-mail me.With all due respect,Me"
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,E40 is the worst MC i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard. How on earth can someone like him get a record contract and sell records. Anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are I always skip the track.
1,terrible boring book,this is one of the worst books l have ever read. l would recommend you not buying it.thank you~Emilia white~
4,This is a wonderful book.,"I enjoy books that portray the animal kingdom as having a world of their own that resembles ours.I read mainly for pleasure. Most books are written to teach, or to state an idea, or promote a philosophy. This is easy to do when writing a book of this kind. The author can make frank statements about humanity without “stepping on people’s toes”."
3,Kindle edition is missing all songs and poems,"I've loved this book since I was a kid, and I was delighted to read it again. Delighted, that is, until I got to where the first song should have been - and it wasn't there. Not one poem or song made it into the kindle text. This is irritating in some places, and actively detrimental to understanding what's going on in a couple of sections. The poems are as much part of the story as the prose, this cannot be called a complete edition when it is missing part of the story."
3,Payback for 2nd grade,"It's time I finally got this off my chest: I kinda hate this book. I am not a person with a good memory. I can't even remember who or what my second grade teacher looked like but I do remember being bored for a great part of my 2nd grade year because of this book. I know, it's a book for children and talking animals are magical but these are the the most boring animals in the whole wide world. The only animal with a bit of character is Mr. Frog and too many of these tales are devoted to stomping the life out of his poor soul. I wanted to cry when he finally lost his charm and became BORING. That being said, having read the book again as an adult the stories do have a charm. It is good for very small children without functional imaginations and should be read one story at a time and not as a novel. Avoid any movie adaptations at all cost. This book in film form should be considered lethal."
5,Wow what a book!,"I was getting kind of sick of the junk my kids are reading. So I launched a campaign to dig up some of the books I loved when I was a kid. I thought I'd start with The Wind In The Willows after I found a great old edition at a used bookstore. Sadly it seems like the fact the copy is a used book is a turnoff for the younger generation. But that gave me a chance to reread the adventures of Mr. Toad and company. Wow what a book! It's even better as an adult. But make sure you get a copy with the original Ernest Sheppard illustrations. Apologies to modern illustrators, but that guy is the genius."
2,You get what you pay for,"""The Wind in the Willows"" remains a masterpiece, with adventures and talking animals to appeal to the kiddies, and lyrical descriptions and dry humor for their parents - but this edition is missing not only Ernest Shepard's evocative (and, some would say, essential) drawings, but every last one of the songs - and that really eviscerates the book. I don't know if the other versions available for Kindle have the entire book, but it would be worth paying something to get the real thing instead of just a part of it."
5,Beautiful presentation.,"It's been many years since I read this book and I got this onefor a niece (7 years old) and thought I'd read it first myself.It is very nicely illustrated; kids will love the picturesand the lettering is large, so if they are being read to, theywill find it easier to follow along.That said, the level of comprehension is probably that of early teen, rather than pre-teen. Maybe that says more about my level of comprehension? :)However, the book (stories) are classics and I am sure any child (or adult) would be delighted with this as a gift."
3,Not that good.,I was forced by my Mother-who loves these kind of animals stories to read it. I thought it would be easy. I mean come on little rats and moles talking is definately a childrens story. But this was so hard to read! In more than one of the chapters I had no idea what was going on. However it was a well written story it just didn't fit my tastes. My Mom read it and loved it. There were a few good parts. But in the jail the human was as big as the toad. It was very confusing..
2,A bend in the road,I am a usually a big fan of Nicholas Sparks but I have to say that I was disappointed with this one. My main complaint is that this story was SO predictable. Still worth reading but far from his best work.
5,Real mystery.,"I cannot be lieve I had not read this book before - really typical Sparks. It was days of analysis my thoughts about this book before I could ""let it go"". So many twists and turns that even now when I think of the book, I am really sad. Still the story was so human."
3,Least favorite Nicholas Sparks book so far,"Didn't like it that much. Figured out who the ""murder"" was in the beginning so it wasn't that great. But I guess if you don't figure it out it will be okay :)"
3,My first Nicholas Sparks Novel,"Nicholas Sparks is the king of contemporary tragic plot. His execution is timely and his setting ideally chosen. His characters, on the other hand, have no mystery. Susan and Miles are introduced with a full biographic background before they are really allowed to steal the show.On the surface, Miles and Susan seem like a perfect couple. The only obstacle they face is the tragedy that indirectly connects them. Other than this, their love is not tested in any other way.Above all, there should be a balance between good writing and plot. I'm not sure what Sparks did for a career before he started writing, but one can never stop evolving their craft. Perhaps Sparks could write in a different genre with a different setting to get a bit of variety. I'm sure he will need it as his readers most certainly do."
2,What a disappointment.,"I fell in love Nicholas Sparks' previous books becase they evoked a lot of emotion. I thought Sparks had an uncanny insight into human behavior and his characters were intelligent and sympathetic. This novel was a huge disappointment, however. I felt like it was written in a rush to satisfy publisher demands and not written from the heart. The characters were neither memorable nor particularly likeable."
2,A bit dull,I was very disappointed in the ending. After having so many chapters of depressing news it would have been nice to have a better written ending.I am still a fan of Nicholis though... just not one of his best
4,Book Review,"A Bend in the Road, by Nicholas Sparks, is a mystery and romance story. It is about a man who has a lot of problems in his life, such as his wife's recent death and his son's everyday struggles in school. The father, Miles Ryan, is a policeman and does everything that he can to find out who killed his wife and to help his son. Meanwhile, he meets Sarah, a kind woman who agrees to help his son Jonah with the his school by tutoring him, and Miles ends up seeing her outside of Jonah's tutoring. Miles and Sarah soon fall in love and many of Miles' problems unravel by the end of this surprising novel. I thought that this book was a good mystery and it made me think a lot about the plot. You don't have to like romance to like this story. Comparing this book to Sparks' other novel, A Walk to Remember, the two were a lot alike in that Sparks is very descriptive in both and both are of the same genre."
3,"Predictible, but a comical book. :)",It's very light reading. I enjoy the funny parts. Towards the middle is gets real predictible.
5,Enjoyable read.,"I like this book. I'm not finished yet, as life continues to roll on, but it's very good. Will recommend to others."
1,A Bend in the Road,"This book did not hold my attention at all. I felt that it was slow and I didn't care about any of the characters. They were all so pathetic that you really couldn't choose who to feel sorry for. The book was also Highly predictable. You knew everything that was going to happen from the first 3 chapters into the book. I felt that this book was a complete waste of time. Then again Nicholas' only good book was ""The Notebook"" and even that was slow at times and uneventful."
2,It doesn't get any more predictable than this...,"The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again."
5,Another great one,"Love Nicholas Spark and most of his books. This was a good one, easy to immagine what is going to happen, but still a very good love story with some mistery."
4,Another Good Read,"Like his Nicholas Sparks' previous novels, ""A Bend in the Road"" is a swift-moving love story, full of hope, angst and human characters that really draw the reader into the story. I don't normally read ""romance"" novels, but Sparks' work is always so comforting and digestible that I like to get one in over a long weekend. ""A Bend in the Road"" didn't disappoint - it was another story filled with likeable characters about whom you inevitably worry, contemplate and cheer."
3,Middle of the road...,"I liked the romantic aspects of the story as well as the intermingled passages from the person driving the car. However, I figured out who was driving the car within the first 1/4 of the book, which took some of the enjoyment out of the story for me."
4,Surprisingly suspenseful,This isn't your typical Nicholas Sparks love story. It's a mystery that anyone could relate to. I'd call it romance with dark twist.
3,Worth the read,"Not my favorite book by Sparks, but worth it was worth my time to read it. I thought it was a little predictable, but it was good."
2,Not very clever - lifeless characters,"I just didn't buy into this book's plot. I have family in New Bern and I enjoyed his description of the town and life there (fairly accurate slice of life). However, the characters were awful. He never developed the romance into anything beyond infatuation. The two seemed to have nothing in common and no reason to stay together. The big cliffhanger is awful and then poorly handled by the characters creating artificial drama -- common in many people's lives, but something I like to avoid. I am actively waving people away from this book as trite and annoying."
5,Co-Parenting After Divorce,"I am a licensed psychologist in private practe. Child Custody Evaluations, Parent Alienation Syndrome (PAS), Child Sexual Abuse (CSA)and Expert Witness . High conflict divorce and divorce cases in general require a no nonesense yet gentle respecful approach. To assist divorcing couples understand and function in the childs best interest, I have recommended Co-Parening After Divorce with consistant positive results. Also, it is my understanding, mental healh professional working with Los Angels Dependency Court issues frequenly recommend this easy to read effective book to assist post divorce parents. I find this an excellant book addressing in understandable terms a complex child cenred issue. Every now and then a special book appears pointing toward posiive direcion. Co-Parenting After Divorce is one of these books."
2,So-So collection of essays by mostly liberal partisans.,"As a supporter of CHARACTER COUNTS!, I looked forward to reading this book. Having done so, however, I'm disappointed to see it is a collection of mostly liberal views on the issue of character. Mr. Dershowitz' attack on Christians, for example, has no place in a book touting ""Character"".Having said that, there are some redeeming qualities, including Dennis Prager's essay, ""The Moral Character of Religious and Secular People.""Buy the book, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by it's most of its insights."
1,Complete Rip off !!,Stay far away from this set unless you want to throw away the CD's and use the jewel cases which is what I am going to do. These film themes are played by 'The Global Stage Orchestra' which are synthesizers and sound dreadful. Don't get sucked in to buy this as I did. I listened for 5 minutes then chucked the whole thing in the trash. Save your money and buy a real soundtrack!
5,Hollywood Schadenfreude,"Somebody once said that everyone has two business: the business they are in and the movie business. That means that just about everyone should love James Parish's new book ""Fiasco"". It is delicious to read these stories about some of Hollywood's biggest disasters. And when you couple people's fascination with Hollywood backstories with our natural inclination to enjoy other people miseries -- especially people with these over-inflated egos -- then it's hard to see how someone would not enjoy this book. The chapter on Madonna's ""Shanghai Surprise"" is worth the price of admission -- she apparently only picked up the script in the first place because she liked the color of the cover. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and revel in the schadenfreude."
2,Fades in a very short time,"Unfortunately, this is one of the only fire rescue pet decals I could find. It fades very quickly and becomes useless. But because I am very concerned over my pets safety I keep replacing them. But I think I will make my own sign now. Plus, $6 shipping for an item less than a dollar, that could easily be put in an envelope with a 42 cent stamp is ridiculous."
3,Fades quickly...,"This is not a sticker, rather a decal that can be removed and put in another location...which is nice. My only complaint is that the decal is in a location that sees about 4 hours of sunlight per day. It has already faded (within 2 months) to the point of needing replacement."
5,Pretty nice,"This seems to be the only Denali hitch cover around, matches nicely. Has an insert to prevent rattling against the hitch."
2,Overpowering,"I was expecting something that was subtle and pleasant. What I discovered was a sharp, overpowering scent that was as subtle as a sledgehammer. One whiff, and I knew this was way too stong for me. I prefer sandalwood when mixed with other scents, rather than by itself."
5,Jade Green: A Ghost Story,"Judith Sparrow disobeyed her uncle's rule of bringing something green into his house. It unleashed the powerful spirit of Jade Green. Judith thinks her cousin, Charles, is responsible for the white ghostly hand that is haunting her. Read this book to find out if the hand is asking her for help or if it is trying to kill her."
4,Great combination of suspense and romance,This book deals softly with some tough issues. (Creepy cousins for starters...) It reads like a great mystery story with a dash of romance. Loved it!
3,Not a true ghost story.,"""Jade Green: A Ghost Story"" was entertaining, but nothing more. If anything, very predictable. Naylor did not achieve a ghost story, but more of a mystery, with a touch of horror. The events exchanged between Judith and her cousin, Charles, may not be appropriate for preteens, in my opinion 10 years or younger. A quick and easy read - I recommend."
5,Jade Green,"Jade Green is about a girl named Judith who has to go live with her Uncle Geoffrey because her parents died. Once Judith starts living there, strange things start to happen (more scary than strange.) Also her cousin Charles is a bit umm...lets just say he's weird. More characters come in and a little spark of romance happens. I won't say who or how it happened. You'll have to find out for yourself.The book Jade Green was amazing! At first it started out a little slow. Then it really came into action by the third chapter. It's a ghostly story worth reading. I recommend reading Jade Green. I also think anybody would love this book. Come on and try it out!"
1,Not A Must Read,"This book is inapropriate. It has a horrid ending for a child, where the cousin of the protagonist tries to force her to have sex with him. Then a ghost strangles him. The cousin had killed a girl after he forced her to have sex with him, and he kissed her. All over. He killed her by cutting her hand off, and she bled to death. Can't you people read Harry Potter?!"
5,Great,Great little book! Very informative. It explained alot of things that went on that day at the cross. It makes me realize what a true miracle it was and is. Ty for writing this book! God Bless
5,AWESOME,This knife is awesome. I wish it would have been the first knife I bought and then I wouldnt have all these crappy knives laying around just taking up room. Buy this. You wont regret it.
5,bullet-proof,"this thing is light and super durable!folds nicely and can slip into a space about 2"" wide to tuck away between uses."
5,Spectacular,"Conquerors from the Darkness is one of my favorite books. I remember reading this book as a child and being swept away with the imagery of a water-covered earth in the future with floating cities and pirates controlling the seas with the sea folk beneath, always enemies with the land dwellers. And how when the enemy from the skies returns the two warring inhabitants of earth finally come together. This book was not just a book to me. It opened up my entire world to reading and imagining."
5,An oldie but a goodie,"i haven't seen Woody in about 20 years, so I couldn't resist purchasing it to introduce to my 8 and 4 year old, but mostly for me. And after initial hesitation, they enjoy the red haired miscreant. And the fact that Chilly Willy is included in this package --- priceless. Almost makes up for years of DVD compilations that featured Woody on the cover and the title, but only featured one or two actual cartoon in a sea of 100 or 200."
5,Woody Woodpecker,Very Good DVDs my kids love the woody woodpeck cartoons and I enjoy watching then again. Vey happy with the product.
5,The Bastard,I loved this series when I read it years ago. I know I'll enjoy it again. I love the detail John Jakes puts into his books !
3,Hasn't aged well.,"I remember this show as my favorite for Friday nights in the 70's, now I watch an episode and it doesn't seem as good as I remember. Maybe season 2 was better?"
5,I Love it !,I will be ordering season 2 soon when I have the funds and I will be ordering bionic woman and no ordinary family amd ext...
1,YYYY--AAAAA--WWW--NNNN....,"Invective should never be confused with Criticism. It cheapens the sensibilities of the writer and the reader.Invective is, more often than not, the opposite of Wit. Unless you're Oscar Wilde.Would that this book could reconcile either point."
3,A slow trip into dissapointment,"When the story started,the reader shared Ruby's hopes and fears about moving back home,then quickly realized that Ruby is a bit of a flake,with an unnatural attraction to her mother.All the cooking,cleaning and eating in the world cannot save this novel from inevitable boredom,with sex added to make sure we are still awake.Would have workde better as a short story."
2,Didn't really resonate with my experience.,"I suppose this is evidence of the different subcultures even within the second-generation Chinese American experience. Though I am also a Gen X second-gen Chinese American, I really didn't feel like the protagonist reminded me of any people I knew. However, the book does provide some authentic glimpses of Chinese family life, and the mother's dialogue in particular is quite believable."
1,"Very, very boring","Even the sex couldn't keep me awake. Since when is sex boring? Ng makes it so, up to the point where you'd rather skip to the next paragraph.They say that an author (or filmmaker) has succeeded if the reader (or viewer) can realistically imagine the characters living on after the book (or movie) is complete. You won't find that in this novel.It's nothing but a disappointing, wordy collection of poor use of metaphors, weak grasp about life in New York City, and choppy, monotonous dialogue.But I give her credit for her first try."
3,dont start here.....,"this is one of my favorite bands,but this album is NOT where to start for the uninitiated.thankfully this wasnt my first experience with them,or perhaps my high opinion of them would never have developed.anyway,this album displays them more or less engaging in Melvins worship,not quite developing their own sound or style.the really low end muddy production doesnt help matters,either.so skip this one and move on to ""take as needed for pain"".you will thank me later"
2,Poor debut; dont buy this if your new to them,Eyehategod are a great band; if you buy this as your first title by them you'll get a poor reflection of their ability. Recommended for... well pretty much nobody. Even die-hard EHG fans will probably not find much for them.Get Dopesick and Take as needed... both those efforts are sludge at it's dirtiest.
3,Vamps?? Not quite.,"I wish I could say I loved this album, and there is no denying that there are many wonderful performance preserved here, but the presentation is not up to par. Ya gets what ya pays for, i guess, but I still wish there were at least rudimentary liner notes, and many of these recordings are available elsewhere in better sounding remastered recordings. Mostly though, I have to wonder about some of the song choices here. Marlene Dietrich and Mae West may be considered ""vamps"". even Bette Davis and Joan Crawford if you stretch a bit, but Judy Garland? Betty Grable? Dorothy Lamour? The Andrews Sisters? Clean cut good girls are exactly the opposite of vamps and as much as I love them all, they don't really belong on this album. Still, for the money not a bad deal if you are interested in music of this vintage."
1,not magnetic,"Received this, but they weren't magnetic. They were stick on. Too much trouble to return such a small item. Just disappointed in poor follow through."
3,Almost good,My stove is right next to my oven and want some hooks to hang my oven mitts on. I got these in hopes they would hold and they would if it was a flat surface. Sadly the side of the stainless fridge is not stainless and has a texture to it. When I hang my mitts on the hooks they just slide down. If I hang them on the front of the fridge they hold really well.
2,Should have bought the stronger magnets.,"I purchased these magnets to hold up a bag of recycling on the fridge. These magnets couldn't even hold up one empty glass jar without slipping. I regret purchasing them instead of the more expensive ones that hold up to 25lbs. I am now going to buy the more expensive ones instead. In addition, the hook portion was very small, making it hard to hold anything except keys. Lastly, the ""magnet"" portion consists of a small, strong magnet glued onto the back of the hook. Generally, I think this is a pretty shoddy product. I would give it one star except that the price was reasonable, if you needed some magnets that aren't that strong."
3,Does the job for light things...,"When I hang light things on these hooks, they work. However, when there is any weight to the object, it tends to slide down the wall. They could be a little bit stronger to make me happy."
4,They work,These magnets work exactly as advertised. You'd never realize how helpful it would be to have something like these on a fridge. I'm pretty sure it would've been possible to find them at a $.99 store but it would've also cost be more than $5 in gas just to drive back and forth from one.
1,smell,This used copy literally smells awful - permeated with some kind of nauseating perfume. Otherwise it's a typical great Sayers collection.
4,Great small camera backpack,"Great product for the amateur photographer... plenty of space for the camera and extra lens or two, flash, whatever..The top portion can hold an extra shirt or two, water bottle..etc.Not too big and not too small."
5,A great back back.,I used this on a recent trip to Puerto Rico and everything stayed safe and dry both in the rain forest and at the beach. It does not look at all like a bulky camera bag and is easy to carry
4,4.75 star,"I would have given this bag a five-star rating if not for some of the minor issues. I don't like the plastic buckle at the main compartment. It didn't line up quite right a few times when I was in a hurry. I never really have to think much about a buckle before. Tamarac should have kept the same buckle design as the one on the chest and hip belt.I wish there was an option to remove the hip belt when I don't need it. For now it just dangles around my butt.Other than that, it's a great travel bag to carry my camera set and camcorder all day long."
1,Mr Lott's book was great argument for more guns,"I find this great book back up by FBI statistics. A must read for those of us who favor the second amendment, it defeats all those liberals arguements for gun control..."
5,Superb reference work on the effects of firearms carry,"The anti-bill of rights people are out in force attempting to use the government to restrict your rights illuminated in the Constitution. This work by John R. Lott provides a detail review of the effects of firearm carry on the criminal element of our socity and the crime they commit. With this information, a compelling arguement can be made for Vermont style Concealed Carry to reduce violent crime. The statistics in this work are not for the faint of heart. Mr. Lott goes into detail involving the factors that result in the conclusion, 'More Guns, Less Crime'. If you cherish your rights under the Constitution, you will be enthralled with this work by Mr. Lott."
2,Intrenational Comparisons,"Astonished to read here a Japanese supporting the concealed handgun argument, and someone else afraid of ""regressing"" to the ""disarmed society of Britain"". How does the crime rate of those regressed states compare to Lott's model states, Arizona, Texas and Oklamaha? Probably couldn't fit them on the same graph."
1,my 9mm goes bang,There is obviously no connection whatsoever between having a gun and shooting somebody. Just as there is also no connection whatsoever between not having a gun and not shooting somebody. And you'd be a fool or a communist to suggest otherwise.
3,Minor but Entertaining,"Also known under the title MURDER WITH MIRRORS, this 1952 Agatha Christie is neither the best nor the worst of her work. Set in a decaying English mansion, the grounds of which have become home to an experimental school for delinquent boys, the novel finds Miss Marple visiting an elderly friend from her own school days--and being plunged into crime when her hostess' stepson is shot dead.Christie is best known for her fiendishly cunning plots, but in this instance I found the mechanism of the crime somewhat obvious. Still, the novel has other, undeniable charms: a renewed acquaintance with the always entertaining Miss Marple, a memorable cast of characters, and a particularly atmospheric setting. While it will never compare with the likes of A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED or MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, Christie fans will find it an entertaining one-gulp read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
3,Miss Marple Returns,"Miss Marple is such a fun creation and I have always enjoyed the works in which Christie features her. This work is as good as any in the series, and contains plenty of griping about arthritis coupled with a compelling crime."
4,Miss Marple visits an old friend,"When Miss Marple visits her old school friend Ruth Van Rydock, she discovers that Ruth is concerned about their mutual friend Carrie Louise. Ruth had recently visited with Carrie Louise, and something in the household did not seem right. She persuades Miss Marple to visit Carrie Louise herself to see if she can detect what's wrong. When she arrives, Jane discovers that Carrie's home has been turned into a haven for delinquent boys by her husband. Soon a murder occurs and the plot thickens. Although professional investigators are called on the scene, Miss Marple exhibits her famous powers of deduction and comes up with a solution before they do. This is a typical, clever Agatha Christie mystery."
1,bad,this is not original record from 1991 please stop selling thing you dont have the only thing good was i got the CD on 4 days
3,Worth the Purchase.,"I'd rather have Slayer in my stereo,, but this band is ok to vary it once in a while."
4,iced earths first,"This is a good debut album all in all. It suffers somewhat from the subpar production and from the vocalists terrible singing. but all the elements (atmospheric songwriting, intricate metal) that make this band great are intact. Like the above reviewer said dont buy this album first, start with anything else in their catalogue, once you listen to iced earth your sure to become a real fan of the group."
2,Could not get through it,"I think Ms. Martin had a good idea with this book. With the widow, and the seaman; and they have completely opposite likes, and personalities. But after a while, I got tired of the dreams the woman was having. She wasn't having much progress, and she couldn't sleep a whole lot. That was her major issue.And the man, his issue was who he could get into bed the fastest. And even though he seemed like he cared about the woman, the only words that kept coming out of his mouth was, how soon could he sleep with the her. Or who was the next sleeze at the bar he could get into his bed. And that got old fast too.It was like the issues Ms. Martin took of these too, and kept banging them against a wall.I eventually dropped the book, and stopped reading.Needless to say, I liked the 'idea' of the book, but not the progress of the storyline."
5,Great story!,"This is a favorite in my extremely expansive library of romance novels. I have a few of Kat Martin's books and this is one of my favorites from her. It has an intriguing storyline...a twist I haven't found in another book yet. Genny and Jack are terrific characters, you laugh with them, you hurt with them...you care about them. I'd love to find another book like it."
2,adjectives abound!,"Can't say I've read the whole book, because I just can't get past all the adjectives! By chapter 2 I was really tired of brown hair, brown slacks, brown shoes, beige cotton-knit sweater, and let's not forget the beige cardigan. And all that by page 9! Just way to descriptive for my liking."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!,"This item is just good looking junk! After searching on-line all day I realize that I'm not the only one with this problem, or the only one who just has to trash this whole system! TRAY I.N.T.I!!! That's all it says, then WAIT! For hours, it will do nothing, totally locked up, tried unplugging for 30 minutes to ""reset"" tried removing the DVD's.I've found two consistent complaints by many people on-line- the popping and the Tray I.N.I.T, some date back to 2007, some as recent as my system. From a company who seems to have had customer complaints as far back as two years for the same issue and still no fixes!Save yourself $500.00.Panasonic is trash."
4,Best Bang for teh Buck,"Very good and versatile system.5 DVD/CD is great, you don't have to open/close the tray and the jewel box every time!MP3 discs are great with this system.Speakers are small but soud is great!"
2,Known defect.,"After 4 months of dealing with Panasonic customer support and their authorized service centers I finally have an answer to what is causing the popping noise and sporadic sound loss. The Panasonic tech actually called me, which renewed a little faith in the company. He said it is a know issue with a number of these systems. Apparently a circuit board on the amplifier in the subwoofer is faulty.Now why does the authorized service centers not know this and why does the customer service personal guarantee you there is not a known defect in the product. I can't tell you."
1,This is unnecessary,"Brick wall+lacrosse ball=better than this item. If you're thinking about getting this, don't. Just play wall ball. There's much more you can do with it and you'll get much better."
4,A Kept Woman,"I've always enjoyed Louise Bagshawe books and this one did not disapoint. Although I don't think it was her best effort, I couldn't put the book down. The book center's on Diana, who starts out as a ditzy society wife who learns how to use her brains in the workforce after divorcing her rich husband. Although I did think the pacing was a bit slow at parts overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Fantastic weekend reading!!,"This book was a great summer weekend read! fast paced, sexy and not too deep. I was actually plesantly surprised."
2,Not Louise Bagshawe's Best,"I was rather disappointed in the love story featured in this book. HAving read and loved an earlier novel, Venus Envy and just adoring the love story in that novel, I was rather disappointed by the one in this book. I enjoyed the rest of the plot but found the love story rather wanting. It seemed to be to be rather crude and I could not see why these characters liked each other apart from the sex, that was all the relationship was about, no romance in it as far as I could see. I did not feel the characters were developed well enough, the growth of them as people was lacking and also disappointing. I would be happier to go and back and read Venus Envy once again."
5,Review,"Oh please yourself, you may say that it was the clinton era democrats for the wmd claim but the funny thing is they didnt act on it because they knew iraq would never use them because we would get them back 10 times worse if u truly love freedom watch this if you are a war monger like the guy who wrote the oh please review be truly ignorant and dont think of the innocent people george bush is killing because that is what it boils down too, we are an occupying country which makes us their enemy and they have every reason to hate us wait no hate war loving conservatives like the oh please writer"
2,"Entertaining, at best.","It's a wonder how a handful of emotionally charged individuals can persuade almost half the US population that their fear-inspiring stories are completely correct. Their former counterparts, numbering in the thousands, are then defacto liars spreading wrong information designed to subvert the country they serve. Wake up. But the video is definitely worth seeing for its entertainment value. I hadn't enjoyed such outrageousness since my nephew made me see a wrestling match with him."
2,Great idea poor quality,"Within the first year one of the power bands snapped and the batting head came off soaring across the yard. I know that my 8 & 7 year old do not have the power to hit this thing that hard. I glued it back on with epoxy resin. Within a few weeks the hitting head cracked. Replacement parts are expensive, I think. I shouldn't have to be replacing the hitting head within a year. Its designed to be hit. I guess the 90 day limited warranty says it all.In addition, I know my kids did not abuse this machine because I have to pull it out for them to play with and am with them when they use it. It is much too heavy for them to move at their ages.My neighbor has a similar device that is not the ""Jeter"" version. He uses his for his baseball team and has had no problems but the bands stretching out. His is almost 5 years old now. Mine didn't last a year.I would not recommend until they can make it better quality."
1,The Click Five: The New NSYNC?,"Ok, I heard the song ""Just The Girl"" on the radio a few times. I'm sorry, but I hated it.The Click Five sounds like another junky boyband ripoff. They are simply 98 Degress, NSYNC, The Backstreet Boys, Dreamstreet, O-Town, etc with a more ""punk"" sound to their music(and I use that term lightly).And, they also can't sing. Unless you call screeching: ""sheeee'sss juuusst theee girrrrlll I'mmmm loookkking fooorrrr"" singing. And who picks name like The Click Five, anyway?! GAY!!!I'll bet these guys fade into the blackness of one-hit-wonder land soon, just like all the other crap boybands. Hontestly, who gives these posers record deals?"
5,Survived HURRICANE IRENE,"The greatest hand held weather station on amazon! Sturdy and durable, super accurate! And a 2 year warranty! Plus I. This little package there is so many measurements, best buy!"
3,Hard to Read,"I found the idea of reprositioning the words to attract the reader interesting! However, I found some of these too difficult to READ! The ""Skipping Rope Spell"" by John Agard is fun and ""Whee"" by Robert Froman is exciting and brings back great memories of flying down a hill on a sled in Massachusetts where I spent my childhood! However, ""Cat Chair"" and ""Stowaway"" leave me cold. ""Merging Traffic""is so clever, It makes me think ""I wish I had thought of that""! ""Eskimo Pie"" and ""Popsicle"" are cute to look at but haven't any punctuation! ""Shadow and Swan"" and ""Forsythia"" are too difficult to bother reading. This is just my opinion and someone else might love it but I didn't!"
1,Not for little kids,"This book is not for little kids. I ordered it for my four-year-old cousin, but after seeing the book I would rather return it than give it to him. He is a good reader and has a very good vocabulary, but I don't think he would ""get"" most of the poems. I also think that the visual effects created by many of the the poems are too subtle for a child."
2,"Too much aobut the author's ""storms""","I generally enjoy action/sports books, and with that in mind began reading this book. I didn't last till the race because of my being totally turned off by the author's endless going over why he was doing the race, and all the inspirational stuff. One of the other reviewers metioned being turned off by the author'sbeing so focused on hsi ""inner storms"". I agree. I think this is one of those books that would have made a great article, rather than a book."
5,WOW !!! WHAT AN EYE OPENER!!,It's almost unbelievebale that we can eaves drop on the president of the United States! This set of DVD's opens up a whole new light on the Johnson presidency. I knew he was rough around the edges but never dreamed he was so full of hate and paranoia! Every moment of these tapes is as intriguing as any mystery novel or movie ever made.
4,A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ABSTRACT PAINTING,In this unique collection we observe a different approach to abstract painting.Julia Brown and Susan Cross show us how a human mind can bring concepts filled with symbolic images from different dimensions of imagination. I strongly recommend this title if you seek extraordinary methods of expression.
2,Why did we need a sequel?,"If you are going to make a sequel, how about a good story. Instead we have the survivor of the first ordeal, rescued and her memory gone. So, along with some police, and some climbers, they go back in and pretty much the same things happen over and over from the first movie. It's so dark you barely make out anyone's face, the flashlights keep breaking and people do stupid things.The ending comes out of nowhere, which I won't give away but makes no sense and sets it up for another sequel."
2,Unimaginative slasher flick,"I have done a bit of caving, and so I bought the uncut original movie as I liked the premise. Six women go into an all but unknown/forgotten cave system. The first half of the film had real character developement and real spelunking. You had a sense of total isolation, which of course adds greatly to the atmosphere of the film. It is a good suspenseful film. Not a great film, but 3-1/2 to 4 stars. As I am not a big fan of horror movies, that is a very good rating from me. Six women went in to the cave, none came out...In Descent 2, they take an elevator. They run into some annoying little flesh-eaters and the obligatory blood fest begins. Sound simple? It is. There is no more suspense than your average ""what's around the next corner?"" scenario. There are a few ""unlikely"" plot twists that hurt more than help. Personally, I don't feel it's worth watching, but there seem to be quite a few people that do. Praise be to Netflix..."
3,"More of the same, only this time, it's boring","This film shared so many similar scenes and ideas with the original, it often felt like I was watching the original Descent. I think they really blew it with this sequel. They had so much room to make this movie interesting and did not. How about expanding on the mythology of the creatures, nope, what about a little back story on the ancient climbing tool found in the first one, not mentioned, and why do so many of the local, backwoods Virginia rescue crew have foreign accents, I don't know. It's also ridiculous to think that anyone would take a hysterical, near death woman back into the lions den from which she had just survived seemingly hours after her escape. The ending was a surprise. Either I wasn't paying attention early on, or they decided to raise this huge question mark, leaving it open for a third, I didn't get it. Creatures attack, people die, that's about it."
2,Why?!,What a bunch of idiots! This was tragic and the ending makes me gag. There was enough stupidity to cover the whole world twice. I gave this a 2 instead of 1 because there were some shocking moments. Watch at your own peril because u will regret it.
4,Second Rate,"it was okay, but hated the ending, which didn't make much sense to me. Why did the old man want them all to die?"""
3,Trendy Horror,"The Descent (1 and 2 together) are for caves what Open Water was for water and The Gray was for snow. It's about the inevitability of death and the ultimate pointlessness of life. But in The Descent the inexorable march of death is punctuated along the way by both human nobility and human evil. The cave monsters in The Descent are like the currently popular zombies: a picture of the human animal without a soul.Philosophy aside, The Descent films are fun, creepy, bloody, rainy night and popcorn fare -- not recommended for the impressionable."
2,This book is only for beginners,"I needed some help in the development of a fantasy sports website. I already knew some of the php basics from reading some tutorials on the web and this was my second php project. So I bought this book for three reasons 1-Its title (professional projects) 2-Its size 3-Its price which is higher than other php books. But although I found out some good things in this book like the beyond the lab chapters, for me it was a disappointment for several reasons:1-I had to read things I already know (programming basics).2-A lot of white spaces(the book should be half its size)3-The book is over priced...If you want to buy this book make sure that you are a complete beginner or else you will not find a lot."
4,Great if not essential.,"On the con side is the fact that most of the songs are revisited on Days of Purgatory and Alive in Athens, both with stronger singer Matthew Barlow. On the pro side is the fact that these are some of the best songs they've done; of COURSE they're going to redo them. If you already have those later albums, you may find this one a bit disappointing."
4,Iced Earth's best album!,"After hearing The Dark Saga because I was highly interested in the thought of Todd Mcfarlane's ""Spawn"" being adapted to heavy metal, I decided it was time to hear some more Iced Earth. I liked Dark Saga, although I thought some of the lyrics were a little childish. However, I can't write lyrics for an inch of my life, therefore I give Schaffer credit. So now I have picked up ""Night of the Stormrider"", and I haven't been happier. This release from Iced Earth is probably their best, although I hear that Something Wicked this way comes is also very good. My only complaint with this one, is Greely's vocals. Yes, he is a good vocalist, but being used to Matt Barlow first, I miss Barlow's growls. I must say though, Greely almost sounds like a death metal singer on some of the songs. If you're looking for some good metal, pick this one up, you wont be disappointed."
3,sophmore release improves,"iced earth's second album, night of the stormrider, has new singer, john greely, and he does indeed a better job then previous singer. this album is about a man betrayed by his religion..and well how about you give this a listen and find out for yourself. songs like ""angels holocaust"" and ""stormrider"" are standout tracks..worth a listen"
5,CarraScent Odor Eliminator,"Having previously used this product, we were very happy with it. It is and excellent product but this order of 3-8oz and 3-1oz spray bottles do not spray because there is no opening in the spray nozzels. On Oct. 16th I sent an e-mail to KCK medical the supplier and have had no response from them and this is frustrating."
4,Brutal As Hell,"Oh yeah! This is so Brutal, heavy and really devastating stuff from these swedish warriors of brutal death metal."
3,Not up to Par,"I'm sorry, this book just doesn't measure up to classic Westlake. Understand, I'm a huge fan of DW - there's one book of his out there, a nonfiction work, that I haven't read. I LOVE Dortmunder. But, this book fell flat. It felt like it was supposed to be much longer. The character development was limited. Plot was thin, frankly. There were some interesting elements, but they just fizzled. One character came in guns blazing, but never interacted with the gang, and was caught with his guns holstered-what was the point? I waited for Dortmunder to rev up and take control of the situation. Unfortunately, it never happened. Read Drowned Hopes or What's the Worst That Could Happen? to see Dortmunder in his prime. This book made me wonder if DW was okay. Is he ill? This book feels like he might be."
2,Too slow,"I couldn't get into this one. I've heard a lot about Westlake's humor, but I didn't see it here. Perhaps he is like Alexander McCall Smith, another author whose appeal I fail to fathom. I made it to page 100, but abandoned it due to lack of interest."
4,Hordanes Land,The first official release from Emperor is actually a split disc with the band Enslaved. Although the sound quality is a little sub-par these early pieces showcase why Emperor are the kings of Black Metal.
2,Disappointing Encounter,"As a movie buff and fan of the original Encounter, I anticipated the The Encounter Paradise Lost. However, I have to say, it had none of the appeal the first Encounter had. Rather than ordinary people, the extreme characters, violence and slow-moving plot simply didn't keep my attention. Jesus wasn't as effective either. I show films at my home to groups, but won't include this one."
1,Stay Away From This Movie,"Wow, I was highly disappointed with the Encounter 2. The pureness, simplicity, and intricate character development of the first film are missing here. Instead we have a pseudo-Christian film that wants so badly to be a secular Hollywood action thriller instead of a movie glorifying Christ. Why do we need such senseless violence and gun play in a Christian film? A girl overdoses on heroin but she still goes to heaven because she gave her life to Christ when she was fourteen? Huh, does that make any sense?? I left the first film feeling encouraged and uplifted. After watching this movie I wanted to repent. Don't waste your time on it."
5,STAReview great help in studying for World History Final,"This book was very helpful for me in studying for the REGENTS, as well as my World History final. It summarized every topic in an easy-to-understand and informative manner. A+"
5,Left Behind review,My book arrived on time exactly in the condition as described. I have ordered several books on amazon with good experience. I will order from them again.
1,Read the Revelation of Jesus Christ instead,"This book is disturbing--not because it describes the judgment of God, but because the prophecies of the book of Revelation are used in such a secular, sensationalist manner. It makes my soul recoil to see the holy Word of God presented as ""religion lite"" or mere entertainment.In the Bible, God is pretty clear that his word is not meant to be added to or subtracted from. I am certain this also means that God's Word is not meant to be dressed up or watered down and made into pretty, palatable fiction.Reading Revelation is really scary, especially if you have friends or family who are not believers. Even as a Christian, Reading about God's wrath and judgment of the human race makes me want to hide like a cockroach. But Christians and non-believers would be much better off to read Revelation than ""Left Behind."" If reading Revelation doesn't get you on your feet, witnessing to EVERYONE about Christ, nothing will."
3,Romanian Anti-christ?,"i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though."
5,Blew me away,"I'm sure I'm over the thousanth person to write a review on this book, but I want to let those out there know that this is how it could end. It makes you think about your life, faith, and choices and when the rapture really does come I hope I'm on Christ's side...I'm looking forward to The Mark. This is a well written series and kudos to Lahaye and Jenkins for bringing so many more souls to Christ!"
1,Depressing and Dogmatic,"Why do people read this trash? It's very negative and dogmatic! Reading about end of times is very negative. Instead why don't you people read about peace, love and prosperity? If you want to buy a book that will enlighten you....GO read Deepak Chopras' books! THis book will only depress you."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This series of books are VERY poorly written. They are wannabe authors that want to squeeze out every dime they can by dragging it out for WAY too long. I wish it weren't so.
4,"Excellent story, even for Non-Christians","When I first picked up this book, I wasn't sure what it was all about. I've heard from friends that the series is great and they can't get enough of it. I finished the book in no time and realized what they were talking about, this is one very good book! It has a great story! My only problem with the book, and why it got 4 stars rather than 5, is that it tends to be on the preachy side, understandable for its intended audience, but annoying for those of us looking for a good story. It's interesting to see the reactions of the characters from a christian perspective, but I tend to find their actions unrealistic and half-laughable.To me, this is a minor problem and acceptable within the context of the subject matter. I look forward to the rest of the series!"
1,Here's a revelation! This book reeks!,"Mr. LaHaye must have been sick the day they taught writing atwriter's school. His characters are thin, and his prose reads likeassembly instructions for a grill. I really wanted this to be a good book, but it turned out to be 468 pages of fluff. This book has all the flavor and texture of a raw potato. If heaven is full of books like this I would rather be left behind."
5,"intriguing, thought provoking, it will change your life","I thought that their account of the last days with scriptural references was inspiring. I couldn't wait to read the second volume. If you are interested in saving your soul, this is a good place to start."
4,Excellent Series,"With the exception of the second book, ""Tribulation Force"", these have been non-stop reading for me. I have enjoyed them tremendously. First of all, let me say, that I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. So, you know where I stand as far as my faith in Jesus Christ. I enjoy the way the authors placed fictional characters with End Times Prophecy. Whether you want to believe these events will take place, or the authors took artistic liberties with the bible, these books are well written and page-turners."
2,Poorly written and weak idea,How long are these guys going to milk this dead cow? If we take the bible literally this series should have been over after the first book. So the only motivation for the authors must be making a buck. Very Christian.
1,This book is poorly written,"I am a christian and I was prepared to cut this book some slack because I believe in the message, but I found it too pourly written to refer this book. The writing is equal to a c- high school composition by a below average student. I hope someday a better writer takes on the challenge to do a book based on the rapture."
3,Good try but shallow,"The first book in the series tries really hard to stick to the Biblical account of the Rapture and speculate what would happen to the world once it happens. The problem, all people with any depth get caught up in the rapture and all that is left are 2 dimensional caricatures of people. Though not in this book, there are some liberties on how things get accomplished to coincide with the Biblical account during the series. I was eager to read the account, due to its reputation, but petered out not even half way through. The book of Revelation is a few paragraphs long, this goes on forever and forever. I think the main goal of the authors were that while we are reading the series, the rapture will happen and we can all go to Vegas and play over/under odds where they were right or wrong."
1,complete crap,"What's truly horrifying is how many drooling idiots actually believe this is non-fiction. Go read a science book, you morons."
5,To Identify with a Character so completely brought tears...,I was amazed to find myself in each of the characters. I am still re-examining my own christianity and constantly find it lacking. I have tried to share it with everyone I know..most recently my husband has decided to read it and is now sharing it with his friends. It is a wonderful way for non-believers and amatures to be intregued into wanting to learn more. I thank LaHaye and Jenkins for helping me see the light!!!
1,Awful - awful - awful,"I can't describe, in the space allotted, how truly awful this book is. If you're a reader, than this book will burn your brain through its sheer badness. Diction, character development, plot...awful, awful, awful.If you're into it for the theology, you should know that the ""pre-trib"" Rapture scenario is a modern myth devised by a schismatic Fundamentalist sect in the early 1900s, and is completely foreign to historical Baptist, Reformed, and other Christian traditions. (2 Thess. pretty much rules out the possibility of a pre-trib rapture, if you need a Scripture reference.)An awful book. Awful."
2,Disapointing,"This book simply trades in on the genius of the Bible, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. I was drawn to this book because of the quality of other endtimes novels, mainly We All Fall Down and The Christ Clone Trilogy, but there really is no similarity between those novels and Left Behind except Revelations. We All Fall Down is full of brilliant insights and fabulous writing Christ Clone is analytically impresive. Both authors made me look at both myself and the Bible in new light. Left Behind is poorly written and doesn't have anything new to say. The only thing interesting about this book is the subject matter, and the author's can't even claim that. If I were you, I'd avoid these books and stick to some of the other novels that tackle the subject with intellegence."
3,Made-for-Television Apocalypse,"I tend to side with those reviewers who found the book rather light. With the exception of Rayford Steele, most of the characterizations lack depth and consistency. The authors occasionally drop off into mini-sermons that clash otherwise with the flow of the story. And as the events of Revelation unfold, the good and bad become too transparent, too black and white, and too obvious. As suggested by another reader, I read the first of the Christ Clone Trilogy and was much more impressed. In the end, Left Behind comes across as the basis for a television miniseries than a fully fleshed novel. I'm not as harsh as some critics, so I give it three stars for being readable, not too preachy, and interesting in its way."
3,Left Behind Book,The book was slightly more worn than was expecting. But overall was satisfied with my product.
3,Pure Entertainment,"I do not wish to enter into a long theological discussion about the left behind series. I myself enjoyed the book as not but entertainment. But still I'd like to say that it started a lot of questions in my mind about my own life as a Christian and if I am living the life on earth that Christ desires me to live.Read it as a made up story while listening to the Voice of God speaking to you, then im sure that you will enjoy this series of books."
1,"Christian Rock sucks, so does Christian Fiction.","Ugh. I read this because a friend of mine is an ex-fundie and she still reads the series as a 'guilty pleasure'. It's such horrible drek, it's hard to even comprehend.The authors seem to have done little research beyond reading the bible, anything vaguely scientific is usually a little off. (I don't think I'd call Ethiopia as the middle-east, either - Libya? Maybe - but that's more North Africa). I stopped taking notes on annoyances after the first chapter. I'm surprised I didn't stop reading it totally. I guess, it's just like a literary car wreck, and I just can't stop looking.In all fairness, the Bible itself suffers from a weak narrative and lack of character development in many areas, so who's to blame the authors. (Yeah, authors - it takes two people to come up with this pap.)"
1,An Absolute Joke,"This book is the most ridiculous piece of trash I have ever read. If you consider yourself a christian, do yourself a favor and leave this behind."
3,"Be careful, don't forget this is an average work of fiction.","Left Behind and the accompanying multi book series would make a great action television series, but if you're planning on gaining insite to the Book of Revelation, leave it alone. My comments are stated because many people I know are taking this literally. Remember this is fiction. As I read, I wondered if Jenkins and Lahaye will soon attempt to write their slant on the experiences of the people that were snatched up first and taken to Heaven. They would seem to be as knowledgable of those events as they are of the Rapture. How you take this book depends upon what your religious (Christian) faith teaches you. I (I'm Methodist) personally don't see the end of the world this way and I only say that because too many people are taking this as gospel. I would have rather given it 2 and 1/2 stars but didn't have that choice."
1,Insulting Christian Propaganda,"This book reminds me of a horrible TV movie.The characters are hokey, and completely unbelievable. The way the characters act in the situations provided are ludicrous.I can't believe there was so much praise for such a bad novel. If you don't believe in Jesus Christ, you will also be incredibly insulted."
5,THE MOST MEANINGFUL BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE!,"My daughter suggested that I read this particular book. She said ""Mom, It will change your life!"" What can I say, except, that ""Left Behind"" is the One Book I shall never forget, next to the Bible, that is. It certainly makes you think about your own life, where you have been and where you are headed. After reading this, which I never laid down once I started, my life is at peace. God bless the authors for sharing this wonderful piece of work with the rest of us. PLEASE, IF YOU ONLY EVER READ ONE BOOK IN YOUR LIFE, LET IT BE THIS ONE!"
2,A holy purpose as an excuse for mediocre.,"I found the message of this novel, or should I say this message disquised as a novel, compelling enough to get me to the end of this book. But look out, this is poorly written stuff. Characters, plot, story integrity, it's all pretty bad. At worst you feel cheated and wonder how this lack of respect for the reader should reflect on the sincerity and veracity of the material. All in all, I read it, considered it, and wished I'd borrowed it."
5,Religious literature that can appeal to all,"I can't say that I will have better things to say than what has been written before. The other comments are pretty much right on target for my feelings but I feel like I should add that this book helped to change my way of thinking. I have always been very religious but this book really does make you think about the decisions we all make daily. It is a book that you can't put down and does not make you feel condescended upon. I would recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians. What great literature to be reading in a day and age where religion is often frowned upon when discussed openly. I think it may help others like it has helped me to begin asking questions and to want to read the Bible to find out more. I wish I had gotten this kind of motivation and craving for religion earlier, but better late than never."
1,Left Behind almost made earths last days inviting.,For 486 pages I couldn't wait for the end to finally come. A religious experiance was missed and the excitement of the comeing of the end of the world could of come in alot less pages. Trite and boring from cover to cover.
5,Whoa!,"A friend of mine told me about the book and I thought I would give it a shot. I've since thanked him for letting me know about it. The book is absolutely fantastic. This book has made me think about where I stand with God and where I should be heading. I couldn't possibly imagine going through what those ""Left Behind"" are going through. If you only read one book this year, this really should be the one."
3,the future,"I like this book because it had excitement throughout this story. Throughout this book it was sad. I like how all of the people disappeared. I did not like how some people stayed back because of their religious beliefs. If they would have become children of God, they would have disappeared too; which means they would have gone to Heaven. A part in this book that was sad is when Lionel's family disappeared. Another is when one day on a plane, all of the people were gone. The book made me feel and think about my future and how I wanted to be a Christian before its time to go. I dont know when that is but I want to be ready when it happens. I try to tell lots of people about Christ so they can get closer to God and accept Him in order to have eternal life."
1,I didn't finish this because...,"by the time I got to page 200 by brain felt like it had been deprived of oxygen and I just couldn't take it anymore. The book's idea was interesting, but it just wasn't well executed. The characters, dialogue, plot, and pacing were terrible. I could go on for hours about all of it's faults. Don't waste your time with it."
4,Left behind,"I have always loved the movies Left Behind, and so thought I would read the book because everyone says books are better then the movie. Haven't finished it but I am sure it is very good."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"I loved reading this book. It was written for everyone, Christian or not. I believe this book can and will convert many. It's written with excellence and suspense. I had to reach the end before I put it down."
3,Books 0ne to five are really good but after that VERY SLOW!,I started this series because the first book was great. Unfortunately doesn't get any better. The writing is poor and choppy........It is a really easy read but it lacks excitment. I find it hard to read it because the story line is very slow.Got through the series reading only the last two chapter of each remaining book. Give The Christ Clone trilogy a try first.
1,Better just leave this book behind in a trash can,"I was told that this book is the best selling Christian fiction series in history. Out of curiosity, I read this 1st one in the series. Poorly written text made me want to throw the book in the trash can right from the start. The attitude of the author is even more annoying. The whole time I was reading the book, I felt like I was treated like a bone-head idiot.Those impressive sales and reviews make me wonder why. I looked around. Couldn't find a no-star or trash on the rating."
1,Christian theology masquerading as a novel,"When I bought the novel, I was hoping for an interesting twist on the old story, hoping that there would be inclusions of other cultures' mythologies. At the very least, some interesting perspectives (a native american's, a demon's, a dog's...). Wrong on both counts.This is just regurgitation of the apocolypse prophecied by the Christianity. What they call a plot is basically a thin covering - four characters, all completely monotonous and without personality, go through a ""plot"" that has no suspense or excitement at all."
1,How not to make converts to God,"The book is heavy-handed preaching, thinly disguised as fiction. Paper-thin characters and a creaky plot. What it does have is an money-making appeal to human fears and insecurities. If God can be conceived as acting as the book proposes, I'll stick to humans who have a loving concern for each other."
5,Spectacular,"Left behind has been a most inspiring wonderful book. I am a bible scholar of sorts and feel that the Authors' Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye have done an excellent job proclaiming the thoughts of those who will be left behind, as they are my feelings as well. I have bought everyone I know, who truly will appreciate a blessing from our Lord Jesus, this book for Christmas. I plan to get all of the books in this series."
5,Captures you from the start!,"This is only the first book of the series....and I can't seem to put any of them down (currently am on #3)... but this is a ""must-read"" for Christians and non-Christians alike (although the Bible is the better source.) If you don't know the Lord, you may wish you did, because knowing what could happen (even if this is fiction) is extremely terrifying. It is filled with romance, murder, politics, international intrigue---you name it---it's in these books. Buy this one, and you will soon agree---you can't wait to get to the next book, and the next, and the next..."
1,If I Wanted Proselytizing I Would Have Joined The Church,"When I look for a book within a certain genre, I try to respect the reviews, interpret the bestseller status, and as a final test read the synopsis. I feel that this book's authors (and its promoters) have resorted to a cheap brand of ""bait and switch"" in order to sell books. A thriller should be just that - not a crossover into religious preaching. I have to agree with the previous review: the potential for great storytelling gets bogged down by blatant attempts to proselytize. ""Gee, maybe that church thing and God and religion, I took all wrong. Let me stroll on down to church and join up."" Please! I take my religious beliefs too seriously to be so loose about them.I tried to read this book. I really did. My first warning should have been that this was on the ""Religion"" shelf instead of ""Fiction."" I give it one star because I somehow managed to make it to page 80."
2,"Read them all, kind of wish I didn't","The writing in this book and the books that follow is bland, redundant, and often times silly. While I can't argue with the authors' view of biblical prophecy, I can't wholey agree with it either. It is difficult for one to believe that good people can't get into heaven just because they are good, and that God would forsake all who do not call Jesus ""Lord"". It can also be quite disturbing to read literature that claims Christianity is the only hope for mankind and that all other religions are false. I say good for Tim and Jerry for taking a stand and not making a wishy washy, P.C. book for the masses to swallow. Work on the writing skills, but keep your stance. Tell the truth that everyone will eventually learn, whether they believe it or not."
1,Fundamentalist Propaganda,'Left Behind' and the other books in this series are nothing more than fundamentalist evangelical christian propaganda written in the guise of fictional entertainment.
5,A Must Read,"After reading the negative reviews of some of the others here, I was skeptical of this novel. But it seems to me that those who said the negative things about this book seem closely related to the unbelievers protrayed in this wonderful piece of apocalyptic fiction. This is a thinking man's book - not dependent on superhyped action to see it through a shabby plot. One can not walk away from this book without an introspective look at one's self. Those who claim otherwise may need to worry where they'll be when the end does come. Read this book! You won't regret it."
5,Revitalizing Book,"I couldn't put this book down, you won't be able to either. If you are interested in the end of the world, this is what it'll be like! You NEED to read this book."
5,I couldn't put it down,I truly enjoyed this book..I've read it before (kinda hurridly) but this time..took my time and read it! It was real to me! It truly shows what is going to happen when Christ returns for His people. He is a loving God and wants you to be in His family but also a just God.. and is not afriad to leave you behind. Will you be left behind? I hope not!**Please read this book! It just might change your life and the way you look at things!God Bless You!
5,This book got to me - big time!,I wish I could give a copy of this book to every non-christian in the world. It's a great wake up call! I found the book hard to put down and impossible to keep to myself. Definately a book for sharing.
2,Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days: 1,"Left Behind leaves me behind..I didn't finish the book because it has an overt religious theme, although the 'blurb' given in the book description doesn't mention it. Definitely not my cup of tea."
4,"This book 4 stars, the whole series 5 stars....","I had a hard time ""getting into"" this first book. I think the extensive character development got to me... I found that I was really taken with Captian Steele's story, and everything else was just noise. However by half-way through the book, I was hooked. And the second book was even better! If you like reading action books... then you will probably like this book. I've just ordered the other two and am not looking forward to the wait for the rest of the series."
3,Whole story should have been in one book.,"This book series has an important message to convey to the unsaved people in our world. The authors should have consolidated the work into one well developed masterpiece instead of the featherweight book I read, Left Behind. Hal Lindsey told the story in Planet Earth the Final Chapter. Give me the meat and potatoes for my money."
5,A Spiritual Awakening,"When I picked up this book and started reading it the words were something that I had never really heard said before. I hadn't grasped the conception of becoming ""saved"" to the true sense. After I finished this book I realized that being saved was the right thing to do. I read this book alongside my Bible. I found that it was very helpful to let me understand how real those words were. I have now moved on to the second book and then hopefully the third and they all are helping me on the right path toward God."
1,Truly frightening tactics here.,"Where does one begin? I find it truly frightening that so many people treat this series of books as gospel when it is FICTION. In an age of wars and civil strife based on intolerance, these authors have much to answer for in their expression of righteous intolerance for other faiths. The world does not need more poison in any form. People, if you seek true spiritual connection, go to the original texts and meditate on them and not to authors who use such questionable fear tactics to convert people back into their disturbingly narrow view of the Divine. Remember this series is fiction with an AGENDA and should be approached with healthy skepticism."
1,A real let down,"The book had an excellent idea and failed in the execution. The writing is infantile in nature and the message is heavy handed at best. If it were even a little bit better, I might consider reading the next one. As it is now, I am not sure it is worth the effort."
3,Religious story of the Apocalypse,"I bought this book because of an interview with the author on NPR (National Public Radio). In the interview he described it as a book about the disappearance of millions of people at the same time and how it was like the apocalypse. During the interview the author was saying that the real cause is never revealed and you are left to wonder what the cause is. I generally like alternate history and sci-fi books so I thought the idea was promising.This is not true, there is absolutely no doubt that this is the Apocalypse as described in the bible and I think his saying it wasn't was to get NPR listeners to but the book. It's an interesting story written fairly well but not a great work of fiction. I doubt I'll buy anymore in the series and I'm not sure I recommend bothering with the series."
5,"A frightening, yet true reminder that we must be prepared.","From page 1, I couldn't put this book down. I was pleased and impressed at how the story didn't deviate from Biblical truths. This is a wonderful book for anyone who has tried to understand Revelation. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
1,Give me a break,"This could've been a great book -- the concept is ripe for a great piece of fiction. However, the authors of ""Left Behind"" have ruined a decent storyline with shameless preaching, utterly ridiculous fear tactics, and just flat-out bad writing. The characters are shallow simpletons, the story is narrow-minded and predictable, and the Fundamentalist slant set forth (basically that anyone who doesn't believe in their brand of God -- a vengeful one) is down-right insulting. I, personally, believe in a loving God, thinking for myself, and taking PERSONAL responsibility for my actions. Obviously, the authors of this series do not agree. I can't think of a bigger waste of time than to go on to read the next 6 books in this series."
2,Really people?,"I couldn't get past chapter 5 of the first book without feeling like someone was giving me a bible lesson. Looked up LaHaye and found out he's ultra anti-gay and even anti-Catholic minister. I'm neither, but I have problems with people who don't tolerate other people's beliefs and made me realize why I wasn't enjoying this book. Being raised with the bible, I see how followers are attracted to this type of story, but its just some minister trying to preach his ways with a fictional novel that he actually believes is true."
5,"Don't be ""Left Behind""","This is a novel but it really explains what is going to happen when God finally says enough is enough. This is about God's promise of a future paradise that anyone can be part of by just believing. Check it out if you haven't read this book. And then do all you can to enure you and your family are not - ""Left Behind!"""
3,"For book lovers, a must. For literature lovers, a bust.","Apparently I entered this book with the wrong mindset. After reading hundreds of positive reviews on Amazon, I bought it hoping to recieve a good book. The novel can be critiqued in two areas; plot and style.The plot was well written. It is blatant and complete. Obviously, it lacks originality, but that is another story. Although it seemed to take some parts of Revelations out of context, it was well crafted.My main problems with the book were stylistic. The authors lacked the writing skills to pull the plot off. No offense, but their word choice and sentence structure seemed rather elementary to me.Left Behind is a good (not great) book. I will probably read the rest of the series. However, literature lovers beware, this is weekend reading."
3,Not a very strong start,"Having read each book to date of the Left Behind series, I can honestly say that the original ""Left Behind"" is the worst of the bunch.Why?Because the character development is so limited, and even flawed in places. In the initial book, so much emphasis is placed on ""setting the stage"" for the story, we never get to meet the characters.The mark of a good novel is one where you associate closely with the characters. In Left Behind, I felt more as if I were trying to associate with cardboard cutouts of actual characters than real people.However, the story itself remains riveting, and the story line a sure winner with religious and non-religious readers alike.If you were turned off (as I was) by the writing in the original ""Left Behind,"" don't be discouraged. The character development picks up in book two and only gets better as the series continues."
1,Comic books for the ignorant,"First, the theological basis of this series, dispensational premillenialism, is ridiculously flawed. For people who want a much saner approach to the ""end times,"" I recommend a little masterpiece by theologian Ray Summers, Worthy Is The Lamb.Apart from its bad theology, Left Behind is poorly written: laughable plot development, cardboard characterization--we need Mark Twain to come back and write ""The Literary Offenses of Tim LaHaye.""In short, Left Behind is a comic book without the pictures. If you want to buy a well-written book that will truly stretch your mind and soul, try Walker Percy's novel, Second Coming."
5,No better book,I have read all the Left Behind Books and found each book to have excellent characters that have believable conversions and life stories. Any person that believes that being converted to Christ takes a considerable amount of time needs to know and understand more about God. The plot is a great eye opener to the book of Revelations and make the future all the more clear. I have read many books and find the authorship of this series amoung the best. These two men are blessed and I suggest every person needing to find truth to read these books and follow the struggles of these characters in the time that is near. Go and get these books and you will get hooked to the life and death situations of the Tribulation Force and the World as all is destroyed.
1,Not What Bible Teaches About the End,"Unfortunately, this kind of book sells so well because Americans are Biblically illiterate.The premillenial dispensationalism which backs it up does not square with what Holy Scripture teaches. Oh, those who make a living teaching it on TV with their charts and analyses of current events can point to Bible passages.End times requires one to understand all of God's Word, not just one verse from Revelation 20. One must come to grips with how OT prophecy is fulfilled, and what is meant by ""true Israel"" both in the Old and New Testaments.For an accurate review of this book, see www.lcms.org.office of the president, ""The 'Left Behind' View is Out of Left Field."" For both sides of the interpretation issue, see Charles Ryrie, ""Dispensationalism Today,"" opposed directly by Hans LaRondelle in ""The Israel of God in Prophecy."""
1,don't waste your time,I am not a Christian nor am I religious at all and after reading this book it'll probably stay that way for the rest of my life. This book is garbage. It attempts to scare you into becoming a Christian by revoling itself around the Rapture and how everyone who isn't a Christian will be left on the Earth during a time of chaos when planes fall out of the sky and cars crash because Jesus takes the Christians to heaven. I didn't know it was a religious book when I started reading it and a few pages into it I got suspicious and then it just got rediculous. horrible book to say the least
3,Left Behind,First off I will say I don't usually read this genre of book. I purchased it on one of the free sites because I had heard how good the series was so I thought I'd give it a try. I doubt I will read anymore of them. I thought it started out fairly good but then it just drug on and on. Every time I'd try to read it I found myself dozing off. I did finish it but just barely.
1,Garbage,"Racist, fanatical and dangerous. Paper cut-out characters, thread-bare plot and very poorly written (no more than a 6th grade reading level). I find it hard to undertand how anyone could accept this as a good example of writing or of Christian principles. If anything, this book would turn people away from Christianity. How could anyone want to be like any of these characters - prejudiced, narrow-minded and having a total disregard for the concerns of others - is beyond comprehension."
1,"This is fiction, folks..","And bad fiction, to boot. Why are readers grasping at badly-written novels as expressions of religious truth? LaHaye's interpretation of Revelation is just that - an interpretation. what's more, the whole scenario is deeply anti-Catholic - if you read what LaHaye has written in his other End times books, you'll see that he consistently and at length defines the Catholic Church as the Whore of Babylon mentioned in Revelation. Why does anyone want to send their money to this bigoted theological scam?"
1,Theologically poor and very shallow,"I read the first two books in this series, and was appalled at the story: if it was JUST fiction (and not ""based"" on the Bible), I would leave well enough alone. But this is supposedly based on the Word of God. Reader beware! It scares me to think that people think this is a good read, or inspiring. Let me say this, the easy-believism in this story should be enough to drive any sincere believer away! But the church today seems to like this sort of fluffy nonsense. And let's not discuss eschatology here. To say that it is almost non-existent would be an understatement. And I think that the antichrist is absolutely not believable. I'm sure that Mr. LaHaye is a nice man, but the content of this book is dangerously lacking in substance and faith. Sorry."
1,Garbage,"I read this and two or three of the subsequent novels just to see what believers in the Rapture think is going to happen in the near future. What a bunch of self-righteous crap! I realize that the true believers will sef-righteously think I'm well on my way to hell, but the truth is they are deluded and go against every Christian principal I've ever learned, first and foremost of which is ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" This is a truly dangerous point of view."
5,LEFT BEHIND A++,"My boss told me to pick up this book, read it and watch it change my life. Quite the doubter, I didn't think about his recommendation again until I was stuck in the MLPS airport for 3+ hours. Started reading the book on the plane and I was unable to put the book down. I was especially surprised at the impact this had on my life. Great writing, great concept, great book. I am hooked and can't wait to start reading book #2."
2,"Interesting theme, bad writing","Of course the end of the world as we know it is a very interesting theme, specially when your loved ones disappear in front of your eyes. But, the characters were created from common cliches, the situations are very stupid and a six year old child can imagine where they're going. I suppose is a best-seller because speak about religion, nothing else."
5,Great book - makes you think!,"Wonder what the last days or years of man on earth might be like? This book is a great rendition of how things might be from a Christian viewpoint, based on Biblical prophecy! For those who know anything about what the Bible says about the end times, these authors make the biblical prophecies come alive in the context of today's world. For those who don't know or understand much from the Bible, this book is sure to provoke deeper thought and questions. However, even if you don't care about any of that - this is a great read on its own merits! My only complaint is that it ended too soon - now I'm anxious for the sequel to arrive on my doorstep! Don't miss it"
1,this book will keep you on the path of holiness,"I could not put the book down. from the time of the disappearance of the passengers on the plane to the disappearance of the saints, the book keeps you on the edge of your seat."
5,A real eye opener,"I usually hate to read. However, once I picked up Left Behind I could not put it down. I borrowed the book from a friend, but after the first night of reading I went out a bounght the first four books of the series. I am now on the third book (Nicholae). This series has opened my eyes to a whole new way of living and believing."
2,OMG!,"A decent book, but how about the....BIBLE! This book is nothing but a less entertaining read and very inaccurate as to the book of Revelations. Go back to sunday school and learn more before writing incorrect info."
4,Page turning fun,"I just finished reading Left Behind and can't wait to start Tribulation Force. I have done my fair share of reading, mostly non-fiction, and don't usually don't enjoy fiction. I was pleasently surprised by Left Behind and had a hard time putting it down. A refreshing read for christians and non-christians alike. Both will find it extremly entertaining."
1,Isn't reading supposed to be fun?,"I was horribly disapointed with 'Left Behind #1'. A great premise quickly bogs down into a dull tedious slog. I didn't enjoy the experience one bit ( It reads like the authors didn't enjoy the write much either). Not only was the characterization weak, there was no memorable action and the prose was lifeless and uninspired, some bits were just downright unbelievably corny. The only sense of wonder I was left with was where Mr. Jerry B. Jenkins and Mr. Tim F. Lahaye got the idea they would need so many different books to get their story across. Eleven installments of this! come off it guys!"
4,A parable for modern times,I attended Catholic schools for 15 years (grade school through college) and didn't know as much about the Rapture and the biblical predictions of the end times as I've learned in this book. What a great way to bring God's messages home to us in this modern world.
5,Makes you wonder if you will be left behind!,I checked this book out of our church library yesterday and couldn't put it down until I had finished it at midnight last night. I couldn't sleep for thinking about the people I know and wondering who would be left behind. I had never really thought about what would happen after the Rapture. Thank you for making me question my faith and commitment to the Lord. I believe I am a better Christian for reading this book. God Bless You Both.
1,Cover horribly misleading.....,"I got this book last week at a local thrift store. I read the cover, back of book, 1st page, and reviews. Not once was it mentioned this was a religious propaganda book. I actually thought it would be Sci-Fi, my favorite genre.I kept plugging away, bored to tears. This is the type of book that fundamentalist thrive on. I'm betting it's on Jerry Falwell's 10 ten reading list."
2,"Interesting concept, but poor writing","My summary says it all. I am just doing my part to bring the overall rating of this book down. A very quick read with a great concept, but something is lost in the writing and blatant propaganda."
5,excellent fictionalized account of 'some real bad stuff',"this book was recomended to me by a work colleague, and once I started reading, I couldn't hardly stop! There was very good use of the main characters (and their development) to resemble ""everyman/woman"". True Biblical info was laid out in a reasonable format: not too gushy, not too intense ! can't wait for the rest of the series ! I believe that this book may certainly alter the position of many sunday saints, if they continue to read the others in the series."
3,Left Behind #1,"This is not Pulitzer prize writing, but engaging and interesting--I'm reading the series and am now on Book 3. There are many gripping parts and it holds my attention, just very simple plot lines. I'd still recommend it and the series."
3,"Interesting, but","""Left Behind,"" (the series,) was an easy read, with an also too easy to follow plot. I preferred Jerry Furland's view of a more realistic turn of future events in his novel, ""Transfer: The end of the beginning."" It has a more believable scenario, is less opinionated, and is more intelligently written than ""Left Behind."" ""Transfer"" left me wanting more, and thankfully there is-it is the first novel of a trilogy. I recommend it highly!"
2,Intriguing Premise but Shoddily Assembled,"The premise of the end of times/rapture/antiChrist isirresistible but these guys come real close to totally botching it.Stilted dialogue and paper-thin characters abound, plus a storyline so ridiculous it almost sabatoges the whole book (these few characters are the only ones that seem to know what's going on? No one else considers that maybe this Carpathia is the antiChrist?). The motivations and behavior of the characters are sometimes unintentionally hilarious, especially those of this Hattie character who has nothing better to do but continue to call some reporter she met briefly on the airplane!"
5,One of The Best,I have to say this book is one of the best Christian based nolels I have read in a very long time. This book has everything. Even a little romance. I'm not really sure what the end times will be like. But this is a great fiction book and to anyone who have not read the other two Tribulation Force and Nicole you really should check them out. I am counting the days till the next one come out!
2,Left Behind Series,"The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.Corrine Robinson"
5,WOW! This book was like nothing I have ever read!!!,"I have never seen such imagination before, this book left me on the edge of my seat. I could't wait to get to the next novel...I hope and pray that a movie producer will read this book and put all the novels on film, and talk about some serious mind boggling imagination to say the least. Once I started the read this book I could't stop the characters were so real to me, the seens so detailed that I felt like I was right there in every seen...amazing....I want to see this book and its sequals in the movies so bad that if someone doesn't make the movies I will send a copy to ever movie producer I can get an address for and let them see for themselves that this is no ordinary novel...there is there is nothing ordinary about it..."
4,This book was off the heezy for sheezy!!!!,I thought that this book was really good. I liked it because it shoke me up about the worlds last days. I definitly recomend this book to any one that is intressted about the tribulation. The book was about the worlds last days & everyone clear across the globe has without any warning vanished leaving only their clothes & whatever else they were wearing.
1,"Wow, I did not no writing this poorly was legal","I have always enjoyed reading about society recovering from apocalyptic disaster. So, I thought mix in the Bible's book of Revelations and modern fiction and you would have a winning formula, right? Wrong! These are some of the most poorly written pages I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Everything about the book is flat. The settings: flat. The characters: flat. Nothing is brought to life in any way. Everything written here feels very contrived. I could go on for days about how terrible this book was but I would end up getting a cramp in my wrists from typing so much. If you have any dignity, or actually care about what you put into your head, avoid this book, and its 11 or so sequels, like the Bubonic Plague."
3,I don't understand the hype,"I received this book for Christmas and was very anxious to get started with it... I am disappointed, however. I cannot believe that the characters are not totally freaking out at the disappearance of the millions of people around the world. I am finding this book to be a fast read, but lacking in detail and realism... How can the world not be totally devastated? If it is, the authors are not accurately and clearly portraying it. It has made me think and remember God in my life, however. Although I am half-way done, I am not anxious to finish it... but I will, just to see if anyone really seems to care about the world and not just their own families."
5,Inspirational,"Wow. I have always been sort of an agnostic. On a good day I thought, ""I hope the Bible is true"". This book was tremendously thought provoking, and it was exciting to learn interpretations of Bible prophecy as I read a fictional book. I have read all the books in paperback so far... and then had to read ""Are We Living in the End Times?"" to learn more. This book has inspired me to learn more about Bible prophecy and inturn increased my faith."
5,I could not put this one down.,"What if the Bilblical prohesies of Ezekiel, Daniel and Revelation are true? If they are, the end times will undoubtedly unfold similarly to this thrilling story. After reading this account, you become convinced that the Bible is as up-to-date as tomorrow's newspaper. Be careful, it might just change your life!"
4,A very good introduction to the subject,"I've read all eight book in the Left Behind series, and highly recomend them. I know that some people criticize them for their simplicity- be it in character, plot, dialouge, or theology- and I can understand why they might do so. But my perspective is that these novels are open to all people. The theology and themes are apropriate for all ages and don't exclude people who know very little about Biblical themes. If people are looking for a more complex, mature takes on the subject, there are several such books available, the best of which is We All Fall Down, by Brian Caldwell, but there is certainly room for diffirent takes on the subject, and Left Behind is a very good introduction to the subject for many people"
4,Final book of the trilogy,"Bryce Courtenay is a solid writer. Starting with the Potato Factory, through Tommo & Hawk, and concluding with this book, he weaves a tale of four generations. As with all the books, this has highs and lows. I read it with my wife and she laughed and cried loudly at different parts. My only commens really relates to plot -- I wish that Bryce would have written the last paragraph differently. Saying anymore would spoil the plot."
3,Weakest parrt of trilogy,I read the Potato Factory and Tommy and Hawk and really found them to be page turners. They gave an excellent view of 1800's London and then Australian prisons and settlements. I cared about the characters. Some of the images were graphic and difficult. I didn't finish Solomon's Song. It was more about WW I and less about the characters I had come to care for. It depicted Galipoli very well but was too emotionally difficult for me to get through.
2,NO story. Good cinematography. Okay music.,"I watched this movie after hearing how highly rated it was. VERY disappointing. Musical score over shots around Russia, or Europe. I couldn't tell since there was no story, no words (even subtitles). Just a guy with a movie camera recording everyday people in their daily lives.The music was NOT good, certainly not great. Even movies like The Third Man (1949) had amazing music. Not here.So you have video and music, with no plot. No words, even silent era subtitles like Chaplin-NOTHING. If the music and video can't keep you interested... Skip this.There are great films from this era. This is not one of them.Walt D in LV"
3,Good Film,"Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl. Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.Buy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed."
5,Movie,arrived in time and in good shape. thanks.arrived in time and in good shape. thanks.arrived in time and in good shape. thanks.
1,NO MERCY,It was a piece of garbage. Filthy language. I don't know why Richard Gere made the film. I threw it in the trash.
5,Coulda been a Better Movie,I got my movie early and in great shape. I would order from this vendor agian. Thank You and Good Night!
1,Completely and utterly inappropriate for a betta,"This 1/2 gallon bowl is completely unacceptable for a betta let alone any kind of fish. Bettas require at the very least 3 gallons of space, preferably 5 or more gallons. They also require a heater and a tank cover (bettas can and will jump). Watch how a betta fish behaves in such a tiny bowl and then see how one acts in a properly heated, filtered, and cleaned 3+ gallon tank. It's like night and day."
2,standard-issue slasher film,"""He Knows You're Alone"" is one of the ten billion nondescript slasher films released without much interest in the 1980s. It sets up a simple plot (psycho killer murders brides-to-be), tosses in a few stock characters, and lets loose with the standard genre conventions (people wandering off by themselves, the 'dead' killer rising up for another round, etc.). The film's key strength is Tom Rolfing's genuinely chilling portrayal of the mute, unhinged maniac. Unfortunately, you have to put up with a lot of lame padding to make it to his key scenes (many of which rip off John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" but at least do it well).Other than that, fans of pop culture will enjoy picking out several actors who appeared in this movie before achieving 'real fame': Paul Gleason (""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Die Hard"") as a standard-issue cop; James Rebhorn (""The Game,"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") as an adulterous college professor, and yes, Tom Hanks as a cocky psychology student."
1,"Oh, what fun!","A groom jilted on his wedding day goes on a bride-killing spree in this slasher flick that would be at home on Mystery Science Theater 3000.The hero of the story is a hapless fellow named Marvin who sort of helps stop the killer before he kills the girl but oh so ironically perpetuates the cycle of abuse. (Every jilted groom is a potential serial killer, you know.)This movie is some kind of time capsule of 1980. The hair styles, the jogging, a post-""Bosom Buddies"", pre-Oscar Tom Hanks in a brief, completely irrelevant role: If you lived through that decade, you'll probably find this a hoot.There are a smattering of good horror shots here, too, that a ""horror completist"" might want to look at."
5,Excellent Reference- MUST HAVE- Authors did the work for busy parents,"Overall excellent book. This is a must have book for families.Strengths: The author gives a recommended book list. This is a comprehensive list by age. She also includes some books from different ethnic backgrounds. She gives sound tips and advice how to impart values to children thru books instead of force feeding them. Great background information about classic books and particular editions and illustrators to buy.Weakness: She mentions books on tape, but needs to add a section on good books on tapes. She could use more books from other cultures on the list."
5,For Parents!!,Are you a parent of young children? Then this book is a MUST read! The list of books in the back are classics that will live forever and are safe for young children. Get it! Read it! Get the books listed in the back and read them aloud to your children!
3,SUPERFAST!,THIS IS SO BRUTAL! THE MUSIC IS GREAT! THE SINGER IS AVERAGE BUT IT REMINDS ME OF HARDCORE METAL! IF YOU LIKE THE BLAST BEAT AND FAST CRUNCHING CORDS YOULL LIKE THIS!
1,The Big Picture,"I was disappointed in this book, primarily due to the actual size of the book. Prior to ordering I tried to obtain dimensions of the book, but was unable to get that information. Thus, when the book arrived and was small in overall size, it just did not meet my expectations for a tabletop book, which I was looking for. The pictures and copy were fine, although there weren't as many pages as I expected either. Overall, I think the information as to physical size and number of pages should be told."
3,Pleasant one day read,"I have enjoyed Hillerman's novels for many years. His strength is writing about the Navajo community and making Native American culture integral to plot resolution. It is great when I can enjoy a light mystery novel and feel I have learned something about a culture I am not very familiar with. I have counted on his accuracy since he seems to have the endorsement of the Navajo community to represent their culture in his books. This book, with emphasis on Washington, a few mentions of Homeland Security and Osama bin Laden, takes him away from where I perceive his strengths to be.His characters always seem to lack depth. They seem to exist to move the plot along. It would be great if he could write one of these books wherein he explores the inner life of some of his characters in a sustained, deep and meaningful way."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I normally enjoy Mr. Hillerman's works, and have a collection I like to return to over and over. This one, sadly, went straight into the box to go to the used book store. The editing was so horrible as to be a joke. It makes one wonder if his writing has always been this bad, and some UberEditor has been working magic for all these years, or if he was just under a huge rush to meet contractual obligations and couldn't be bothered to actually write a decent book.It is also disappointing in that the story could have been exceptional, given a bit of care. This is an important issue to all the tribes, but should be just as important as a history lesson to all Americans as an indicator of just how corrupt the American government was in the past, and remains today.Next time, I will take a little trip to the library before I automatically add the next Hillerman novel to my collection."
2,Certainly not worth paying for hardcover,"As appealing as Jim Chee is, as sweet and naive as his Border Patrol almost girlfriend may be, this is a bad plot. The villans are too obvious and tiresome.I have real trouble with the ex-CIA pilot turned hero; the crowd would boo this one in a movie. It's just too way-out-there.Maybe Mr. Hillerman has nothing left to say."
1,Who wrote this? Surely not Hillerman,"If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true. I am amazed that it was published."
4,Great Summer Read!,"Another winner by Mr. Hillerman! The plot is not nearly as complex as Wailing Wind, and perhaps has some unlikely events, but all in all, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. The aspects of Washington politics are rather chilling, and maybe all too true."
4,Off the reservation,"This is one of Tony Hillerman's weakest mysteries, but it's worth reading for a plot twist that will make it interesting for long-term Hillerman fans.I suggest, as others have, that you first read several of the earlier books in the series to get to know Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, the Navajo detectives who surely deserve a place in the hall of fame for fictional detectives. You won't be able to appreciate fully this book without being familiar with the back story.Contrary to Hillerman's usual practice, most of the action in this book takes place off the Navajo reservation, way down in the New Mexico bootheel near the Mexican border. Hillerman's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent. Hillerman also preaches in this novel, a bit unusual for him. He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues.Smallchief"
2,"Predictable at Times, Inconsistent at Others","My overall impression was that this book could have been written from the script of a made-for-TV movie. Maybe visually--with rugged scenery and good looking actors--this story could have been a way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy night, but as a book worth reading it comes up lacking. In particular, the villains are second-rate and only do villainous things when it suits the author's purposes. Then, the number of proper nouns used per page is probably second only to the Bible, owing to the naming of many extraneous characters and places.This book is okay for reading on a long train ride or a stay in the hospital, but it is not one you'd recommend or long remember."
3,Hillerman off the Reservation,"Great, as are all of Tony Hillerman's Navajo stories. Off the Reservation and into the modern world."
2,This book is a pig,This book comes nowhere near the quality of most of Hillerman's work. It fails to generate interest or suspense and the relationship between Chee and Manuelito is ridiculous.
3,There's No Atmosphere Here!!,"Most of these guys photographed in this fourth book of the Edition Euros Series look like they would rather be somewhere else. No one is playing with the camera or showing much emotion. They all seem to be staring off at another planet, trying desperately to avoid contact with the camera. Now don't get me wrong these are beautiful photos of very handsome and beautiful looking guys, both in facial features and body, but the lack of eye contact just left me cold.As for the commentary at the end of the book, it meant nothing to me. I can only say if you're a collector of this series you will definitely want this book, but I won't be revisiting this one as much as the other photographer's works!"
1,Waste of time,"I rented this from my local library to preview before purchasing. I was hoping to learn how to line dance but all I got out of this DVD was the frustrating ""entertainment"" of watching a professional couple dance. They didn't give any instruction. The woman who did instruct was just a voice saying things like, ""This dance is the Electric Slide. Ready? 1,2,3,4 2,2,3,4 3,2,3,4...""The dancing couple always face the camera so it's very confusing to try to follow. Also, the male dancer seems to jump in once the female dancer starts to dance - like he wasn't sure what was going on.This video was created for people who are proficient dancers and can jump right in. It's NOT for beginners who need a little more instruction.I'm glad I previewed it before wasting my money on this one."
2,Keeps popping open-Clutch,It is not enough space for credit cards. Also getting the cards in and out it is too tight.If you get too much paper money in your wallet the hook keeps popping open and youhave to keep fastening it back constantly. Not real pleased but nce quality for the price.
1,STUPID,"I hate this movie because.The girl's dad marries the alien from Outer Space when the credits come a lot of spooky stuff comes on this movie was on TBS Superstion.On December 24,1998.In Kansas my grandmother watched all of it I arrived in Kansas on December 17,1998 my sister,brother too."
1,"""1 star"" for one star.","There's absolutely only one good reason to watch this movie, and that's the fact that it features the brilliant Joseph Maher. -He's superb here, yet again. Unlike the film, this wonderful actor (who died in '98) will be sorely missed."
5,Fun Loving Movie,This movie is a fun family movie that can be watched over and over again without you ever getting tired of it. The second one is just as cute. Great for small kids and big ones but the only downfall is it leaves you wanting a St. Bernard for yourself.
3,Beethoven,Not as good as the sequel. Beethoven Two hilarious. I choose to not use all the required words for this review.
3,"""Built for Speed""--","While ""Built for Speed"" is an excellent book on NASCAR for the younger or new fan to the sport, many hardcore and older fans will find the book a sore dissapointment.Vintage photos are placed strategically throughout the book (Richard Petty's 1975 Dodge racing at Riverside among them). Surprisngly, I found that many of the newer pictures seemed to have poor picture clarity in comparison to the older.One of the books subtitles describes it as the ""Ultimate Guide to Stock Car Racetracks"". At best, it is average. Information regarding the races tend to be in-accurate (the 1986 Napa 500? Not quite. The Atlanta Journal sponsered the race through 1990, Hardee's for just one year, and Hooters took it until Napa took primary sponsorship in the mid-1990s.), however information regarding prelimnaries of most tracks, and early days provide a nice touch.I gave ""Built for Speed"" 3 stars. It's certainly not the worst, but I've seen better."
1,shockingly terrible,"I love the Cro-Mags but this record is just plain bad . try ""Age of Quarrel"" if you want some spectacular hardcore. It is an amazing, ground breaking classic as far as I am concerned. Alpha Omega III is a waste of time and money.File under ""crappy semi-metal"""
5,outstanding purchase outstanding service,"I am very pleased with the C.D. I've wanted to own that music for some time now and now I have it to enjoy! Also I need to mention that there was a problem with the first C.D. sent me, it wouldn't play properly and of course the tune that was defective is the one I bought the C.D. for! I let amazon know about the problem and i'll tell you unequivacilly, that never have I had such a fast, caring, hassle free resolution to the problem as was my experience with amazon. I had a replacement C.D. so fast and free return shipping with an apology I'm still amazed. thankyou amazon and thankyou ""rainbow""!!!!"
4,Black Metal in its infancy,"Compared to today's Black Metal, Blood Ritual is somewhat primative. By that I mean the guitar sound is different. Although the sound is heavy, they don't have the same distortion sound as today's BM. The lyrics are dark, the rhythm is an overall evil presence, and Vorphalack on vocals does a good job bringing it all together. The songs, you have to picture a satanic ritual on stage as if it were a play, because it more of art and music blended together than just music about satan. I give this album 4 stars because it is a good Samael album, but not their best. I recommend Ceremony Of Opposites."
5,Another must read from Watchman Nee,"This book opened my eyes to that longing in my heart to touch His spiritual reality. Not just truth, but reality. Then the reality opened. A must read."
3,Okay,It does what it is supposed to do but I'm wishing I saved the 100 bucks and just used the apple ipod dock that I already had. Would be better if the on screen display didn't look like it was created in the 1980s and if it had the ability to display visualizations and/or album art.
4,Pretty Ricky Is Something Special!,"So I was kind of skeptical about this cd. But I gave it a try anyway. And I am pretty glad that I did. The cd is great! All the songs are good and the boys blend the vocals and rapping perfectly. The rap lyrics, could have been stepped up a bit though. The beats are well produced too. Overall, I say Pretty Ricky did their thing on this album. They don't even begin to compare to Jodeci, but they are worth checking out.Hot Tracks: Push It, So Confused"
1,real generic,"pretty ricky is basically a 00's group who missed out on dropping there stuff in the 90's. Jodeci&R.Kelly have to be there main influences because on this Album as on there debut Album they channel them both big time. the only song on here that got my attention was ""On the Hot Line"". I dug that Groove. vocally Pretty Ricky is missing chops. the songwriting forget about it. Production is hit&miss at best. they come across like a lost 90's Novelty act that missed there time,but yet might sorta last by default."
5,Jodeci of 07,"Hey thiz album iz trill, them pretty ricky boyz did it again, they even added that Jodeci flavor into they style. I really enjoyed the album, but hey it still doesn't top Bluestars.My Favorite tracksSearching For Love (bonus track)StayMake it like it wasToo Young (just the sound of the song not the message)Late Night SpecialThe slow songs are where they do the best, 5 stars for the PR boyz"
1,Such a waste...,"Living proof of how working in publishing can help your more-than-mediocre book get on a bestseller list. Horribly self-indulgent. And if I had to read one more quasi-humorous entertainment industry reference or another gem about author's obsessive-compulsive disorder...Read Encyclopaedia Britannica instead. It will surely be more interesting, far less irritating, and I bet it will not have inexcusable, distracting spelling errors on each page."
2,Bottom line: Not recommended unless you are very bored.,"An Ivy league gradueate in his mid-thirties sought to stop his intellectual slump (currently a Entertainment Weekly editor) by reading the entire Enclopaedia Britannica and to become the smartest person in the world. It was catchy for about the first 50 pages with fun facts and his deliberate, and often time awkward, attempts to impress his friend with his newly acquired knowledge.From then on, the selected facts and his ""epiphanies"" grew less and less interesting and a growing frequency of his infertility, or his concern of maybe he was infertile, emerges. In the end, his wife did conceive and bear his child, he skimmed through the entire Britannica in about a year, he did not become the smartest person, he thought the experience is worthwhile (perhaps because he was able to write a book about the whole saga and profit from it). There you have it, the big spoiler of the finale.Bottom line: Not recommended unless you are very bored."
2,Not what I expected,"I have to agree with the other readers who found this book too ""smarmy"". I got tired of hearing about Julie. Why not write a book about Julie and trying to get pregnant? Or a memoir about the life of the Jacobses? I expected far more interesting Encyclopaedia Britanica info than I got. And some of the entries had nothing to do with the particular word or theme. I'd have to go back to the title of the entry to remind myself what I was supposedly reading about...Some people really have nothing better to do. This book does not show that Jacobs really got smarter. Maybe more full of himself (if that's possible)!"
2,"Good premise, but quickly because tedious","I got this book from an earlier Kindle sale, and only was able to find time to read it about a month later. The book starts out good, but quickly becomes more of a diary of the author than any real discourse on knowledge. It because boring and monotonousness to read and it felt like the author was simply trying to summarize parts of an encyclopedia as a replacement for actually sharing his journey.Overall, it's not a worthwhile read, and I don't think I came out of it feel like I'd gained or learned anything aside from the author's personal family dynamic."
1,This Book is So Painful,I am listening to this as an AudioBook and it is so painful. The author is just obnoxious and Bo-ring. Also there is just no contribution or enlightenment to be had from this book.
3,Wish I would have had the idea sooner!,"Essentially, Jacobs uses the Encyclopedia Britannica as a tool to describe a year of his life. Although nothing unusually interesting happens in his life during that time (albeit his wife becomes pregnant and he does appear on Who Wants to be a Millionaire), the book works because he seamlessly weaves his humor, philosophical musings, and encyclopedia entries with the mundane everyday happenings in his life. I also enjoyed the book because the idea of reading the encyclopedia from A-Z is something ridiculous that I would do (I once tried to watch all the foreign films at the local video store from A to Z in order - of course Jacobs does much better because I only made it midway through the As). Finally, I liked Jacobs' humor because it is similar to Augusten Burroughs. I'm looking forward to reading The Year of Living Biblically."
2,He should have read grammar books first.,"Within the first two pages of the book, A. J. Jacobs commits three syntactical errors: he says that he ""brought D. H. Lawrence novels on vacation,"" when he should say he ""took"" them; he refers to the years since ""graduating college,"" when he should say since he ""was graduated from college,"" or at least "" since graduating from college""; and he says that he remembers ""a couple things"" from college, thought apparently one of them is not the fact that he needs the preposition ""of"" in the expression ""a couple of things."" I stopped reading the book at this point."
4,It's very cute - read it!,"Laugh-out-loud funny in some parts. Maybe a little tedious toward the middle (probably sort of like, say, being in the middle of reading the encyclopaedia), but still well worthwhile. I recommend it for entertaining, humorous reading that sneaks a little knowledge in without being heavy-handed."
2,Disappointing,"Well... Good title and interesting idea. That said...I have not read Jacobs since ""The Year of Living Biblically"" about 4 years ago. I liked that one much better. Maybe he got better (TYoLB was later than this book) or maybe my tastes have just changed.This one had some things in it that were humorous but it was mostly just one annoying story about his life after another. Listening to his list of First World problems and complaints was not funny, it was sad."
2,I see why,"I was extremly bored reading this book, although it recounts a tale of extreme hardship of young overweight Annette, who suffers repeated sexual abuse the characters are more interesting than the very predictable melodrama."
5,REMARKABLE,This had to be the best book I have read in ages!!!! you could feel the pain that the characters were going through. This was so true to life. A book that made you laugh and cry! I can't wait for the author's next novel.
4,great read,This is my 1st novel by this author and I throughly enjoyed it. I love stories written in first person and keep at a nice pace(speed). This book did just that.
2,Skip the Coloring,"I loathe the ACB assignments. The amazon feature of looking into the book only shows the first few pages, which happen to be the clearest and largest coloring pages. The rest of the book is torturously time consuming. I really think there are better ways to learn anatomy than wasting time coloring things. They say that coloring helps the information ""pop out"" and stick in your brain. I think that approach does not work for every student.The black and white coloring pages are too tiny. Also, don't bother using colored pencils. At least markers help speed up the time.Skip this book unless your school requires it. I loathe the whole process and ended up buying additonal anatomy and physiology materials just to help learn the information.Melissa Barrow"
2,Do not reccomend,"I don't suggest buying this book. It was very detailed but the pictures were too small. It did not help me at all. I suggest flash cards, or if your looking for a coloring book, I would suggest one with larger pictures."
4,Wonderful,I found the book to be wonderful in helping me with my biology class. It was in perfect condition and I love it. I will definitely order more books from Amazon.
3,Adequate,"This is a good re-enforcing tool when learning muscle groups. However, the text is a little too small for my liking. The most helpful aspect is when coloring in groups, its much easier to visualize how they work together, and makes memorizing them easier. The biggest drawback to me was the size of the drawings and text; too small."
5,Wonderful Study Aide,"This book is a wonderful study aide for anyone studying Anatomy & Physiology, it explains complex concepts in a very accessible way."
2,Just Not Enough,I am returning this book and The Physiology coloring book. This isn't a good learning tool for me. I love how the books are detailed and also give additional information on the particular structure or process.
2,great art but poor labels,"I bought this book for my daughter who is interested in human anatomy. The two stars are for the illustrations, which are incredibly detailed and well executed. The microscopic scale of the entire layout on the other hand is absolutely ridiculous for an art book. Even with the steadiest hand and perfect vision it would be hard to color in the individual segments or find the corresponding label for it. The fond used for the labels and other identification is badly chosen (I guess the ""handwriting"" style, or close to it, is to look friendly and less like a textbook, but it is actually very hard to read), and also miniscule.In short, this book needs to be re-published at a much larger scale in order to live up to its promises. I found it entirely useless and returned it."
4,Philly Soul,"Hall & Oates are the most successful duo of all time on the charts. This is in large part due to their 80's output which has some good songs like ""I Can't Go For That"" & ""One On One"", but has alot of cheesy stuff like ""Maneater"", ""Method Of Modern Love"" and others. Their 70's music is a different story. They released some of the best blue-eyed soul music ever recorded and this self-titled album is a great example. Most people are familiar with the big hit ""Sara Smile"", which is a great song, but the album has alot to offer in addition to that. ""Out Of Me, Out Of You"", ""Gino (The Manager)"", ""Camellia"" and ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore"" all have a definite Philly Soul sound and they easily could have been recorded by any of the Philadelphia International artists. The duo started to get a more poppier sound after this release, but this one is a real burner and worth a listen."
4,Great mid-70's soul,"I feel that this was their first real soul album. Their first three albums were kind of all over the map: ""Whole Oates"" had lots of folk, ""Abandoned Luncheonette"" folky and soul,and ""War Babies"" has a real art-rock feel. With all three albums, there was an element of true soul in their writing. On this album, the ""Silver Album"" as it is sometimes called, soul is the predominate sound. Songs like ""Sara Smile"", ""Nothing at All"", ""Out of Me, Out of You"" are three examples of the wonderful soul sound on this album. There are some rock songs as well: ""Camellia"" and ""Gino"". Of their first four albums, this is my favorite."
3,this claddagh..,"I ordered this because I needed something like this for the charm bracelet I purchased recently. The quality of this silver charm was good. But, it was a little pricy and filmsy. Maybe the half of the original price would be fair for this."
4,Definitive Black Metal,This is maybe the darkest and scariest cd ever...Mayhem is a band whos rough past have overlooked there awesome music...influenced so many bands
5,black metal,"if the word black metal would be existing in dictionaries, this album's picture would be appearing right next to it. too much has been said about this release and i dont know what is it i ought to be adding. just one of those rare albums that have an intense visual quality as well as musical, and which stay engraved in your head forever after, whether you hated or loved it."
3,MayheM,"Many consider this to be the pinnacle, the epitome, the definite BM release... i disagree, i consider Darkthrone's 'under a...' and 'a blaze...' to be in that category. Anyway back to MayheM, grim and dark, and one of the bands to start the 2nd wave of BM. Blah blah.. my words don't do this any justice, just get the album! :P"
5,Essential Pure Norweigian Black Metal,"When i heard about this album everybody said that it was good, but when i got my hands on it, it turned out to be one of the best black metal albums i had ever heard. Its just pure black metal done how it should be done written by one of the black metal godfather (euronymous-R.I.P.) Definitely a must have for any black metal fan. \m/"
2,Watch the first film but not the second,"I watched this today & I saw both back to back. Here's my opinions on both movies:Prom Night 3:This was bad, but it was bad in a good campy way. This was an over the top parody of horror films in general as well as the second film in specific (which is a great movie you need to watch). The acting was actually pretty decent & while I'll admit I didn't laugh that much, it was still entertaining to watch. This is something that's great to watch during a horror movie marathon or on Halloween.Prom Night 4:Drink heavily during this film. It might make it worth watching. I got so bored watching this movie that I started to fall asleep. There just wasn't enough to this to really make it interesting to me.In the end I'd recommend this for a rental but I'd really recommend against purchasing this unless you've seen the films & know that you like them. This isn't something I'd recommend buying blind."
3,Absorbing legal thriller.,"As entertainment novels go, this is a good 'un. Joseph Antonelli is a defense attorney who smells a rat after two judges are killed in the same manner, and offers his services to the homeless and seemingly helpless man accused of the second murder. Only Antonelli has all the clues to this engaging puzzle. Worth reading as a distraction.Problems (why this is a three- and not a four-star review): 1) Mr. Buffa is a bit guilty of over-writing. You'll find yourself thinking ""yes, you've already said that"" too often. 2) The secondary plot line, in which Mr. Antonelli's long-lost love reappears, goes nowhere worthwhile. The book needed either more or less of her. Less would've worked for me.I recommend the audio version. It is very well-narrated and you won't have to spend time outside the car on this book (let's face it, the reader who said this is ""as good as fiction writing gets"" is, shall we say, overstating his case)."
4,PRETTY FAST READ,This was my first D.W. Buffa book and I was not disappointed really liked the battle in the start ( antonelli has with judge jeffries) About half way thru i had kind of figured who was behind the murders but it was good to see how it came about. Would definitely recommend you willnot be disappointed
4,A different kind of musical,"I saw this film in its initial theatrical release in 1986, and enjoyed it quite a bit. For the most part, it holds up many years later. It is an extraordinarily flamboyant musical, and in explosively stylized musical numbers conveys the birth of rock 'n roll/mod culture in London. It is very imaginative. James Fox is a pleasure to watch as always as a corrupt, powerful fashion designer and David Bowie does a really wild musical number as an advertising man amped up on his own energy. The lovely Patsy Kensit is perfectly cast as Crepe Suzette, the seemingly carefree yet quite practical beauty who is desired by everybody. This movie is based on the Colin Mac Innes novel of the same title ( it was published in 1959; it's part of his London Trilogy ). The novel is a real delight; well worth reading."
3,It's different,"So for those of you longing to get some tidbits on Nuryev's life or see some of his dancing, this film may not be satisfactory. It is a ballet about his life, starring other people. The dancing is good but he himself does not appear in it. I was hoping to see some clips of him dancing through the years, so this film was not what I was expecting."
2,Disappointment--FICTIONALIZED--This description should be included.,"I was all set to see a documentary, which is what the existing description calls it. Instead, what the viewer gets is a ""fictionalized"" version of the life of this great dancer, which is far from what I was led to believe."
2,"No, Diego, No!","My 5 year old watched this for about 30 seconds, said some choice words about it not being interesting, and refused to watch any more. Now admittedly he can be a bit ornery, but rejecting a show completely like this usually is a pretty good indicator of the quality."
5,"Indescribable, Haunting, and Perfect!","I had the great fortune of recently meeting Kenny Passarelli, Otis Taylor's producer and bass player. After a fascinating stroll down rock & roll memory lane recounting Kenny's storied career as a musician (Mannassas, Joe Walsh, Elton John, et al), Kenny mentioned his new ventures in producing. ""White African"" was a parting gift from Kenny - I was and still am blown away by the talent, technical elements, and social commentary featured in this opus. Otis Taylor's storytelling coupled with his instrumentals and vocals left me wanting more. ""White African"" is a must for any devoted blues fan and any emerging fans who seek something ""different"". Thank you, Kenny."
5,good art for dark times,"Stark and hauting...this is not a pick-me-up, but masterfully arranged and performed, absolutely deep and real, a tower of remorse and memory to the legacy of early black america. If you have a feel for country blues or dark alterna-blues, then for god's sake, get this CD!!!!!!!"
1,This sucks,"I mean it's a decent album, but not something worthy of the Morgoth name or their fan base. A classic example of the ruination of a legendary band similar to what happened to Celtic Frost with Cold Lake. Like Frost hopefully someday we will see Morgoth again redeeming themselves."
2,It worked until the hinge became unwelded,"Said hinge seems to be spot welded and it came undone at one location...very poor attention to this detail. The key is a bit difficult to use if one is in a hurry to access the weapon. Otherwise it is a reliable way to lock your firearm in the car, specially if you want to carry your gun in California."
1,Poor design - scratched my gun when locked,"The case is solid but the latch can contact your gun inside if you don't position it carefully. My Ruger P95 was a tight fit and required a little downward pressure and when I locked the case, I scratched the handle and frame.I returned the case. I found a case I like better at Barska. It wasn't available on Amazon but can be ordered directly from Barska. It moves the latch out of the case storage area and looks like a better case."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the assorted Bazooka bubble gum and received the original flavor only. Since I have opened the package, it looks like I am stuck. Would have been happier had I paid for what I requested."
4,Cool Story,"Ok... first of all I'm not gonna say this movie blew me away, etc. The story is an excellent time -travel sci-fi thriller, but as far as movie making and quality of the film itself , it's so-so. The acting isn't too great (ok, though), the production/direction is OK but not what most Americans are used to (huge Hollywood productions). I liked the story although it wasn't 100% original (sort of a mix of several other pre-existing sci-fi stories. It is a long movie but the suspense of the conclusion keeps the viewer interested. It was the story, though, that gives it a 4 star rating."
4,Well balanced claw hammer,I liked this hammer alot. I think that is well balanced and very durable. I have had it for a few years now and have not needed to replace it or wanted to replace it. It is very good for all aplications. It is a nice hammer to have in your toolbox for all of the general hammering needs.
2,Sigh,"What a great premise and start to the movie as most of the world's children fall into a coma. 10 years later, no children are born that don't fall into the same coma. The stock market crashes, riots, the world is uneasy. Then the children wake up and they are out for blood. Sounds great, and the children first waking up is really scary. Then the story just falls apart, and the ending is just stupid. Nothing is really explained, and you are left empty at the end. No real gore and average acting. Clive Barker's name is attached, but he certainly did not write this."
2,Snore....eject,Great premise.... but falls apart on the screen.A good idea that goes nowhere and becomes so tedious we ejected it after about 50 minutes and moved on to another rental.
3,"Not one of his best, but still worth adding to a collection.","Another JC film set in Australia, with plenty of good fight scenes and an equal number of bad actors..."
4,Could have been one of his greats.,"Quite simply put, this could have landed itself in Chan's all-time greats (which include Drunken Master 2, Police Story, Project A, Crime Story, Operation Condor, Young Master, Miracles). The action is some of the best he's done in years with set-pieces that are sublime, including the fight on the horse-drawn carriage and the construction sight. What stops it from being a masterpiece? The performances. Jackie gives his usual solid performance, but seems to be surrounded by wooden and ham acting galore. Sadly some of the lines are unintentionally funny and detract from what is otherwise a top-notch Chan film.If you're reading this Jackie, please remake this film with different actors!"
3,"Not one of Jackie's best, but still a good movie.","This isn't one of Jackie's best, but it is is still definitely worth seeing. The main problem is that the American release(as usual) is a tragically butchered version of the original. Scenes have been cut up as well as deleted and some of the action scenes were changed with some really awful looking slow-motion. Still, this movie has some very good action-comedy."
1,They've changd the preservatives they use,"I've been using Reviva products for years - until recently - when I noticed Sodium Benzoate is now among the ingredients. This is a known carcinogen that converts to Benzene in the presence of Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), something that is also found in skin care products. I contacted the company and learned that, Yes, they changed the formulation but the preservatives represent a very small amount.The FDA has standards for the amount allowed in food and other products. Problem for me is ""in aggregate"" how much are people getting from all the products they are consuming and applying? (Soda & many other foods contain SB... And then there is the issue of combining such a skin care product with Sun exposure."
4,Decent cheap earbuds with volume control,"Insten earbuds with volume control aren't great, but they good for the price. I've had a pair for several months and they still work fine. The foam covers sometimes fall off, tho, but that's minor."
5,Must-have!,My 5 month old son loves this video. He recognizes all the characters at this point and gets excited when I put this on. Plus it gives me a half hour to get other things done while he is transfixed!
3,Still sounds fresh,"I know this cd is a couple years old, but I am just getting around to updating my amazon account.This cd is good. As you read in the other reviews, I noticed some bad reviews for this album, I must say that if you are unfamiliar to the supertones that it could sound a little off, but I love this album. This is my 2nd fav by them.What is comes to (ft. Toby mac) is one of my fav songs off this album."
2,A diamond in the rough?,"An unpolished gem? I'm sorry, but I'm trying to be nice. What I really think is tentative, hesitant, and error-laden. This sounds more like a high-school recital than the beginnings of a future piano star.I know that Lang Lang has evolved into a great talent, but this was sure one bumpy start. I can't imagine anyone but Lang Lang fanatics wanting this in their collection."
5,Just about died and gone to heaven!,"I checked my e-mail tonight and noticed an Update from Amazon stating that Charmed would released on DVD, and just about keeled over!! Us Charmed fans have waited Seven Seasons and not to mention heart ache. Andy dying, Prue passing on, Piper and Leo's on going struggle to lead normal lives and save their marriage, Phoebe and Cole's whirlwind of a relationship. But we have also had the good. Paige joining the Sisters, Wyatt being born, Chris coming from the future, (then leaving), and Baby Chris being born. Now ture fans and new comers can experience all these emotions over and over again!! I can't say how excited I'am to have this on DVD!!! Thank you WB!"
5,finialy,"this was a great show, i have participated in several mail drives trying to get this released on dvd. looks like they are finaly releasing it. i just how that they can realease the following seasons faster. i watched the first season on wb and loved it but since they moved to cable i haven't been able to watch them. i hope the rest of them get realeased soon. maybe they will release them onb a sceduale like they did buffy, tell us when the next is realeased when they release this one..."
5,FINALLY!!!,"Shannen Doherty made this show, and the first three seasons were top-notch stories and writing! After Season 3, the show slumped, and it certainly turned into garbage after Season 4."
3,A Buffy/Angel Dvd Owner's Review of The Charmed Dvd,"Charmed is indeed a great show, but the dvd set did not impress me at all. I own all of the Buffy seasons and all of the Angel seasons which is probably why the Charmed dvd set did nothing for me. No music, no introduction, no nothing! Also there were no commentaries and no special features or no featuretts. Other than the episodes it was a complete bore! Now that doesnt mean that i wont buy the other seasons of Charmed because i think the show is that good. But if you are looking for more than just the episodes then this is not something worth buying."
4,Buy This and Let Them Know We Are Interested In More DVDs!,"Charmed is an awesome show, no doubt about that!I read some reviews by fans who were angry about them not putting extrs on the DVD and advised other fans to boycott this DVD package but I think Charmed on DVD with no extras is better than no Charmed on DVD at all and if people dont buy this than they might just decide there is not enough interest in this show and not release any more seeasons on DVD so I say buy this DVD package and let Aaron Spelling and the WB know that there is a lot of interest in them continuing with releasing Charmed on DVD!"
1,Very Disappointed,I haven't received this product -- which I ordered the first of November. I've tried twice to contact the sellers to no avail. This is supposed to be a Christmas present for someone who's been unemployed since February. Thanks a lot. Respond to me and I'll take this review down.
3,"""A Bit Disappointed""","Ok, granted I love the show and am a big fan, and I know many others who were waiting, less than patiently, for this to come out on DVD. I must confess that I'm disappointed in the little effort that they put into this DVD collection. Alright, where are the special features? That urked me, but I bought it mostly because of the episodes but even I must agree that the picture isn't as clean as I would've expected it to be. I must admit the price wasn't bad, but if you're not a fan of this show, it's not really worth it."
4,A Cute Treat,"I gave the ""Charmed"" series a chance, because the show paid tribute to the supernatural. Season One wasn't a knock out sensation like ""Supernatural"", but it grows on you, slowly. Shannon Doherty (Prue) is not a likeable character in the beginning of the series, but the viewer will witness her growth without compromising herself. In season one, Holly Combs (Piper)didn't establish her identify strong enough beyond being the middle sister that everyone likes. Combs does shine in the episode ""Wendigo"". Most viewers will probably fall in love with Phoebe, Alyssa Milano. She's cute, insightful and she cannot be emotionally scared. Some viewers may become irritated with the semi-love interest of the cop, Andy and ""Prue"", but I bought into it, because it felt realistic. True friendship can be more satisfying than a boyfriend. Most people will be pleasantly surprised by ""Charmed""; enough to buy season two."
4,Great but missing stuff,"I love Charmed, the dvd is great, but its missing subtitles, even if its in english. I think its important and a DVD that is so waited on the market should at least be done more carefuly.But anyway the quality is great and the episodes are amazing!!!"
4,one of my favorite shows,"I absoulutly love Charmed. This is the best ""Magic"" show ever. It will get you hooked if you are into the SuperNatural or if you just like funny drama.**Reminder**The eighth season starts Sept 25th on the WB!"
5,YIPPEE!!! FINALLY CHARMED ON DVD,"I am so exited for this to come out. Part of the reason why it's taken so long for this to come out, partly is getting permission from the artists for the music that was used on the episodes, also Shannon (PRUE) wasn't giving them permission to use her image on the dvd cover. Also, something about a contract where they wouldn't be able to release it until 2005? I know that TNT had syndication rights to charmed...not sure if that is something that had to do with it.Well, whatever the reason...it's coming finallly!!!!"
5,It's About Time!!!,I have been waiting FOREVER for this DVD. I could never figure out how other shorter running shows had their DVDs out and Charmed never did. I missed the premier way back in '98. But I soon started watching and completly fell in love with the show. I would even time dinner around it! I have also got my husband and 2 year old daughter watching. I know I still missed some of the early episodes even with the re-runs and now I will get to see them all togetther!
3,No extras? That is just plain wrong!,"First off, I am very happy that the first season of Charmed is on DVD, as I have been looking foward to it for a long time.However, I was severely disapointed by the lack of extras and the presentation of the DVDs. I could have done a much better job using paintshop. Fox treats its cancelled shows, such as Firefly, better than Paramount does with its successful shows, such as Charmed when it comes to preparing their shows for DVDsTo anyone who is just discovering this show: Get seasons 1-4, but don't be so quick to buy seasons 5-7, the show went downhill in the last three seasons"
5,Charming,"I loved it. The box was in the condition stated in the article, and I enjoyed that none of the disc were scratched."
1,Waste of Money,"As much as I am excited about finally having Charmed on DVD, I was sorely disappointed about the lack of extras. There is literally nothing but the episodes- not the unaired pilot, commentaries, interviews, behind the scenes footage, or even a picture gallery. I can watch these episodes twice a day on TNT. And if I really want them without the commercials, I'll TIVO it. I didn't need to spend nearly $40 for this. It was a waste of money."
5,Made me a better mother!,"When I received my copy of the book from Amazon.com, I began applying Naomi Drew's principles to my 3 1/2 year old daughter. She had been having tantrums and talking back. After only two days of following the advice of this book, my daughter's behavior began to change. She actually started using ""I messages"" and stating her own feelings. My house is more peaceful and I have become more consistent and happy with my children. Excellent, excellent, excellent book for all moms who want to have a more peaceful home!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1,"Sorry, It's a BAD UNIT","I'm a positive person. That's why I'm positive this is the worst coffee maker ever made. It overfills the basket, and it takes nothing to end up with spillage of coffee that lingers for days. It's difficult to fill. The clock is silly. Buy a different one- you can't go wrong."
1,High Risk Purchase,"Please see the following reviews:Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffeeemaker, WhiteAlthough this unit has a slightly updated face, it has a similar high failure rate. I do not understand why it hasn't been recalled as numerous issues have been noted involving smoke coming out of the unit as well as leaks."
4,"Quality Machine, Great Coffee","I've had this coffeemaker for 3 years. It makes the best coffee of any pot I've owned. The construction is sturdy and it's got lots of extras that really make it worth the already low price... Auto shut-off, brew strength selector, programmable, beeps when coffee's ready, warmer plate temperature selector, clock. The design is very stylish and looks great on the countertop. My only complaint is that the clock, while it is technically digital, uses 'hands' instead of a number display. Overall though, it's a wonderful machine."
1,Leaks and wears very fast.,"This looked sleek, which is why my husband paid too much for it. It started leaking after a few months, and only got worse. I finally threw it out after losing 25% to spillage every time. It also didn't take too log to look ragged and worn, dispite careful care. I will not buy this brand again."
3,Not Bad for the $$-- a few annoyances,"Our last coffeepot didn't warm the coffee at all so I had to microwave my coffee after it finished brewing. So when I purchased this coffeepot my standards were pretty low. Overall it does the trick, I've had no issues with it leaking so far (have owned for over a year now). I don't like the auto-shut off after 2 hours and there is no way to turn that off. If I want to keep the coffee warm for longer I have to basically push the Brew Now button again. Which brings me to the second annoying thing about this coffee maker...the 5 long loud beeps telling me it's ready. Again...there is no way to turn this off."
2,SHORT LIFE,Leaked after about a year.....quit completely after 2 not recommended if you want something to last
5,cheap is good,I have a few good pens (pun intended)This is as good or better than them.You will not be disappointed.Mine is F nib......same as Japanese M
1,File format problems,"This product is only capable to format a hard drive in FAT32 format. This is neither the standard for the PC nor the Mac. If you have a pure PC or Mac network, I advise getting a NAS that uses the appropriate format.The FAT32 format only makes sense if you use it as a cross-platform NAS. But even then it is pretty poor, as it requires tight rules for file names. I constantly ran into problems where back-ups got interrupted due to incorrect file names (too long, wrong characters).I decided to send the product back and try my luck with a different one."
3,"Much better than Part 1, but for Halo collectors only","""Survivalism"", the lead single from Nine Inch Nails' smashing and politically charged album ""Year Zero"", was released in two parts as a single. ""Survivalism, Part 1"" featured the song itself along with the ""Tardusted Remix"" (which is also featured here as well). ""Survivalism, Part 2"" features all of the above, as well as the instrumental version of ""Greater Good"", and the rocking video for ""Survivalism"". You get more here than you do for the rip off that was ""Survivalism, Part 1"", yet this single still feels like it's meant for hardcore Halo collectors only. What you get here isn't bad, but there still could have been more put here, and the disc itself feels less like a ""Part 2"" and more like a ""Part 1"" with bonus tracks. That aside though, you get more bang for your buck here than with ""Part 1"", but either way, if you're a Halo collector, you'll probably be picking both up regardless."
1,"Why don't they have a ""zero stars"" rating??!?!?!?","If you look in the dictionary under ""sucks"", I'll bet the cover for this movie is there. Typically, I love horror, supernatural, and dark movies. This one tried to be one, but failed miserably. I noticed since the dawn of easy DVD, that there are many, many horrible film companies that should be imprisoned for pawning such bad crap on the world. The film quality looks like Joe Shmoe filmed it with a camcorder. The special effects are much, much less than special, and I've seen better acting at my 6 years old's school plays. This movie was a real turd and anyone who was even remotely involved should hide out in the desert in shame for at least a decade. Single words to describe it are in the vein of: Sucks, sucktacular, crap, crappola, craporama, and the like."
5,"Blend of new and old india in an eden setting,love survival sacrifice and a great storm","I fell in love with this novel and liked it so much I bought four copies to give to my dearest freinds as presents. An Indian American marine biologists befriends locals in a remote island setting to help her in her study of the River Dolphin. As her life becomes intwined with theirs, love, loyalty, sacrifice all come into play in one of the great storms of literary imagination. Timely considering the worlds disasters of the past year."
2,sequel disappoints,"My wife and I both read and enjoyed Kleopatra, and wanted to read Pharaoh. Well, my wife wasn't able to finish it, but I stuck it out to see what happens. The writing isn't nearly as good as in Kleopatra. There is much better fiction about this period by Collen McCullough."
3,So So,"I bought this thinking it would be more ecological than always buying the single, disposable plastic Go-Betweens. However, I find the angle awkward and the conical shape of the bristles difficult to work with; so I will probably ditch this soon and just use the disposable ones."
2,class,"returned book because of the class, would not get unless you are required to buy this book for school or?"
4,Kids Love It!!,Great item!! It's sturdy and my kids love it! They even hung off the curtain bar and it didn't break! (thank goodness!) Well made product and hours of entertainment!
5,This is an awsome DVD player that every one should own,"I have another DVD player but this one is so much better. This one has long battery, can play any type of DVD (not kiding). Its plug has a converter built into it so all you need to do is hook it up with a adapter and any where in the world it will work. I have droped it more than once and let me tell you it works the same as it worked before. One problem would be that it gets scratched up esaily but can live for a long time. :) :D"
5,Smooth!,"This is definitely a departure for Crystal. Laid back, almost... live, sounding vocals. Very Christmasy!! Spinning right now! :-)"
2,Pretentious debut,"Of all the Eisenstein films, ""Strike"" is easily the weakest. He attempts far too much in order to be eclectic and achieves far too little in the process. But it was his first movie, and it does feature some good examples of montage (which would be perfected with ""Potemkin"" and ""October"", two truly great works); it's just the humor that really kills this movie for me. If it hadn't been for his attempts at being amusing, and had he toned down a bit of the symbolism, ""Strike"" would rate much higher. As it is, it's a historically important, pompous bore. Image does have a nice quality dvd though."
4,How sweet it is!,"Jackie Gleason recorded dozens of albums of instrumental ""mood music"", but he only recorded one album where he sang. It was a 10-inch LP that was released in 1954 (I actually have a near mint copy of it). The album featured eight comedy songs, most of which were based on his catchphrases. The songs are usually sung in character as one of his famous creations. They are actually pretty amusing songs, although it helps to be familiar with the characters the songs are based on. The CD adds several bonus tracks, most of which are ""mood music"" that served as themes on his TV show. But there are also two funny poems recited in character as Reggie Van Gleason III (""Casey at the Bat"" and ""I Had But Fifty Cents""). Fans of Jackie Gleason will enjoy this CD."
1,It expired in 3 months,"I ordered multiple bottles of this product in August, 2012 for myself and family. I didn't realize it has expiration day of 11/2012 until I gave to my family and friends in my country in November last year. Of course I couldn't return it to the seller. It is very embarrassing that I gave them an expired gift.For the future reference, I would like seller or amazon to list the expiration day (if there is one) for the products, especially those will expire soon."
3,great for legs,I found this lotion to be a little thin. It is nice for the legs though. I have been using it after showering and Ireally like it.
4,Consistent,"I've done tons of research into ""anti-aging"" products and for my price range, this is the one for me. This is a good, basic lotion, that I actually use every day. No, I don't magically look 20 (I'm 59). But, my skin is softer since I started using this lotion as part of what I do every day for my skin. I'm frequently told I look like I'm in my 40's. To determine what Olay product to use, I took their website quiz.Linda from Florida"
3,Decent,"I bought this product because it got rave reviews from all sorts magazines, skin care professionals, etc. I must say, I am a bit disappointed and will not be purchasing this again.As I am still relatively young, I was looking for something to give me good UV protection to prevent signs of aging. But of course I want to product to make me look good while it's doing that.This lotion feels greasy on my skin when I first apply it and gives my face an oily sheen. I am not sure about breakouts, as I've been having trouble with that anyway, but I think it may not be helping in that regard!Too bad."
3,Can't recalibrate,"I think all instant read thermometers need recalibrating occasionally and this one does not offer that feature. I've had mine for a couple of years and loved it at first but now it is no way near accurate and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it. So, my message would be to spring for one that is a little more expensive, but can be re-calibrated."
4,Very Good Read,"I totally agree with Master Hahn's review, especially the slant that Fife has for animals fats. It certainly does come out. Certainly a worthwhile purchase. As always, bear in mind that we need to read a lot of books in the low-carb world to truly get a well rounded view of the subject. This books fits in well with all the others."
1,I rather someone slapped me for the money I spent on this,"First off this program is not what it says. The program only backs up old games that have been out for months and even then they're far and few between. Then I had to contact Farstone (the program's company) to get a better serial code because it wanted me to pay and additional amount of money so I could use their shotty update system to back up new games (which doesn't matter because they update it every other month with not so impressive games anyways). But the kicker was that while I was updating their patches, the file got corrupted and crashed my computer. I tried to contact Farstone to at least find out what was in the update and they would not even talk to me! Steer clear of any program with Farstone."
4,Was hoping a newer release would have captions?,"Wonderful movie, as others have reviewed, but with all the French language, it would be helpful to have English captions/sub-titles for English speakers."
3,No knew info,If you have any other Hagin books on healing than you already have this info. If you don't have a Hagin healing book than go ahead and get this one.
5,Winner,"This is a winner. Gives a description of the poetry type, explains the rules, and gives one or two samples of each. GREAT illustrations. This book has a good sense of humor. This is great for reading out loud -- we also go searching through Shel Silverstein and Adam Rex books for examples of the types of poems presented here.It is non-threatening for my son who loathes language arts -- great illustrations are a nice bonus. The whole family likes this.Pair this up with ""How to Write Poetry"" by the same author or ""Pizza, Pigs, and Poetry"" by Jack Prelutsky.How To Write Poetry Scholastic GuidesPizza, Pigs, and Poetry: How to Write a Poem"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Audiovox does not stand behind this product at all.I am having the same issue that other consumers have had: picture freezing, scratchy sound, screen goes dead.Unfortunately, I am seeing a trend for this small DVD player.After calling customer service and explaining that I bought this thing 6 months ago they responded with ""the policy is 3 months"" if you would like to get your product fixed, it will cost $96.00.If you are in the market for something that will work for 3 months and then break - this is your product. However, a company like Audiovox should stand behind the products that they put out in the market place. Shame on Amazon for continuing to support this dirty little company."
2,A waste of money,"Good thing we bought this item well in advance of our overseas trip so we could replace it with a product that works! After having charged the battery for the recommended 8+ hours, when the player operated on battery power only, the screen would go in and out and the sound was very scratchy. I called Audiovox and they agreed that the battery was most likely defective and suggested that I get the battery replaced.I don't know about other people, but when I buy a new product I want it to work from the get go. If it does not work, then I have my doubts about the product line in general. This is the last time I make a decision to purchase a product on the basis of price only. You get what you pay for!I have returned this item to Amazon and purchased a more expenseve and name-brand player which does in fact work."
2,Battery DOA,"I guess you get what you pay for. My girlfriend bought this DVD player for me for Christmas and it worked ok when plugged in, but the battery died after 10 minutes. I tried charging it several times but it would not work. I returned it at Best Buy and picked up the Panasonic LS55 instead, which is about twice the price but has a much sharper and glare-free screen and an unrivaled 10 hour battery life. So far I have been very happy with the Panasonic."
5,Wow!,"Who would've thought a baby would love spinach? Mine certainly does! I bought it on a whim because I haven't seen spinach flavoring in any other brands at the grocery store. Now we keep it stocked. I only taste the spinach, not the potatoes. Great food. It's texture is the same as other 2nd baby foods."
1,baby doesn't like it at all,My baby doesn't like it at all.Earth's best is much less smooth than Gerber's.The bean is not as fresh as you make your own.
3,Our Baby Won't Eat It,I love Earth's Best and our son eats almost everything by them. Not their fault that he doesn't seem to like green beans but the consistency is a bit runny for a stage 2 food in my opinion.
3,It Works.,"My husband & I bought this at least 10 years ago & it still works. Could be much softer, like Cyberskin, but is not super hard like plastic. Both functions are VERY loud. Batteries last a long time. Easy to use by yourself. Flicker tongue on end of vibrator could be much softer; it is definately strong enough on low & can be irritating with just a little pressure. I want to try cutting off the tongue but am afraid of ruining it. I am VERY small & it could stand to be a tad bit longer & wider but it does the job. It's about 4.25"" insertible & in circumference."
4,A great tool for helping a child understand adoption,"This book is ideal for children who are trying to understand what it means to be adopted, with text geared toward those around four years of age or older. It doesn't avoid the tough issues of adoption: the child in this book voices the fear that her adoptive parents will ""give her back"", and in a fit of anger she tells her adoptive mother she wants her ""real mommy"" (birthmother). These are real emotions that adopted children experience, and as my daughter and I read the book together, we can talk about her similar feelings."
2,Not the best of Gomez,"I am a huge fan of Gomez. The first 2 albums are classics and are completely overlooked. I can't believe that this album is getting such good reviews. Buena Vista is the only song which is at the level of Bring it on or Liquid Skin. These are almost all songs that they didn't think were good enough to put on the first 2 albums but they had enough of them to make some money. I am sure that there next studio album will be another masterpiece but, this one is far from the best Gomez."
4,Rescue us from fundamentalism,"This book is warning against fundamentalism and the in-human lack of compassion that seems so deeply rooted in the American sub-culture that holds sway over Bush's White House. Are you a Christian who is concerned about poverty? The USA's policy of pre-emptive war? Gleeful disregard for nuclear proliferation? Torture? The environment? Carter lays out a passionate case that those concerns are in line with Christian values. Carter does not cede the definition of `Christian' to the pro war, pro death penalty, pro torture, anti ecumenical crowd who insist that they alone can articulate what it means to be a Christian. This is a courageous book by a very thoughtful man"
5,Carter is brilliant once again,"Jimmy Carter did not have a remarkable presidency, but since he has been freed of the trappings of the political world, he has been able to share his brilliance and his honesty, unencumbered. This latest book, Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis, is no exception. George W. Bush has worn his religion on his sleeve, but, in my opinion, it is a false Christianity. Carter doesn't go that far, but he does very clearly point out how this administration has undermined the morality of the Nation.It was a pleasure to read this book, both for its contents and its readbility. If we could get Bush to read it, we might even survive his presidency. God Bless Jimmy Carter."
2,Carter's Assumption is off base.,"Former President Jimmy Carter bases this entire book on the mistaken assumption that he (or anyone else) has a worldview that is neutral. He thinks that everyday activity and the Christian faith can be neatly separated. He even attempts to incorrectly attribute this perspective to the founding fathers. Carter criticises many modern politicians and voters for allowing their religious beliefs to influence their approach to every decision they face. However, he never faces the fact that his view that religious beliefs are not the foundation of every act he undertakes is a religious position in itself. He is assuming that the secular worldview is the ""right"" perspective and anyone whose religious beliefs form the core of every action is ""wrong"". If you believe the myth of neutrality, you'll like this book. Otherwise, you will be disappointed."
4,"an important point of view, although not very deep","The most valuable part of this book is that Carter makes his critique of the conservative Christian push to erase the line between church and state from his highly religious Baptist perspective. It provides a needed counterpoint to the strangely prevalent notion that to be religious = to be conservative. He reminds the reader that the virtues of tolerance and concern for the poor can be deeply rooted in Christian history and theology. However, on no topic does he goes into great depth, so the reader is ultimately left unsatisfied."
5,I'm sure it's a good book,I purchased 4 of this book to donate to area libraries on behalf of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee. I did not get a chance to read it so I plan to get another from Amazon in the future for myself :) Books were in great shape upon receiving them and packed very well. Thanks!
1,Typical Carter,Another diatribe by good 'ol Jimmy. I guess he figures he didn't screw up America enough with his Presidency. He has alot of nerve criticizing others. We are still dealing with Iran thanks to him.
2,Reply to T.F. Miller,"I agree with you that Carter was an ineffectual president. It would be more proper to say that he was histories worst president---the worst president in American history. And it's easy to see why Bernard Goldberg included Jimmy Carter (#6) as one of the top 100 people screwing up America.I am a christian and believe in the fundamentals that Carter tries to imply in this book, but Carter appears to be somewhat talking about values and looking the other way as members of his party act in ways that have nothing to do with values.I do agree that there is a moral problem in this country but Carter seems to skim over the real problems here. And considering how Pres. Bush won the 2004 election by such a wide margin (3 1/2 million votes) winning both the popular vote and the electoral college vote and nearly 2/3 of the states in the union, it appears that more Americans are tuned in to the Bush-morals than the other side.One more thing: Real christians spell God with a capital G."
2,"Vacuous, Empty Rhetoric","I'm a Republican, which is why I received this as a joke Christmas present from my Democrat brother in law. I decided to give it a shot, if for nothing other than sharpening my critiques of democrat positions. I found this book to be surprisingly empty on substance. Carter spouts unsupported easily refuted liberal canards, while managing to avoid taking a serious side on any major issue. I imagine this will satisfy the average democrat looking for someone else to espouse what they feel without the nuisance any real facts to support the average knee jerk positions in the book. It's a great book for fans of Carter. Had it been written by an unknown, it is doubtful it would have even been published. It is that empty."
5,What a joy,"An absolute pleasure to read the views from a scientist, politician, and man of faith. President Carter articulates his views clearly and with wonderful candor. I only wish more people would be willing to read this delightful book."
5,Great way to get to know Tiesto.,"This was Tiesto's first album I owned and the one that got me hooked. Tiesto is now my favorite DJ, and I also own 4 other Tiesto CD's. I think one of the greatest things about this CD is it shows Tiesto's style. He is great at building a trance atmosphere and at the same time he keeps you on your feet. This CD will suck you right into your own world. Try thumpin' this CD while driving and take in the summerbreeze."
5,If I were a dog I sure wouldn't pee on it!,"Absolutely DRIVEN mix of quality trance. You can never go wrong starting a mix with ""Dido"" and the CD will be over long before you want it to be."
3,I used to like this stuff?,"It's funny, Tiesto, Van Buren, and Van Dyk used to be my DJ idols. But recently I was introduced to deeper, darker, more ""intelligent"" trance. Nobody does this better than Sasha, and John Digweed. I recently bought summer breeze in an attempt to rekindle my passion for the Tiesto style of trance but was dissapointed, and ended up just popping the progressive back in.Although I still think Tiesto ranks up there with the greatest, his style is just not for me anymore. I suggest giving Sasha's Ibiza mix a try, with patience, it might just change your life. It honestly doesnt get better than that"
2,Its an $18 club photo of Tiesto.......Thats about it.,"Kinda technoish, not Tiesto at all. I like ""caught me running"" which was nice...overall i give it a D+. Tracks are lame (I think) lack the ummpff of a 'makes me wanna getup'...more like make me wanna change the cd. Buy it if you have a collection or can spare money but this is def not his best work."
3,the millennium question unsolved,"In his lively book Stephen Jay Gould offers a lot of fascinating material as to how the millennium question has been treated with in modern times. But when it comes to the fundamental matter, that is to the establishment of the Chistian numbering of years in the 6th century, Gould commits the all too common mistake to believe he can solve a historical question by common sense. He should have taken his time to look into the sources at hand concerning Dionysius Exiguus and Beda Venerabilis. He would then have detected that the millennium question is of an even more intricate nature than he had imagined, and in particular has something to do with the calculation of the full moon."
1,I cannot review this item because it was never delivered.,I cannot review this CD because Anybook never delivered it. So I don't know if I would have enjoyed listening to the CD. I won't buy anything from Anybook again because they cannot guarantee delivery. There was no tracking on the shipping agent and they have no idea where it is. It does not deserve a rating of one star but I cannot complete this review without a minimum rating.
4,you can't always get what you want ?,"I thought for a mini about the FF this one was fine. It encapsulated the foes from the earlier era's of the books and provided a good if not spectacular read. I wasn't put off by Freemans prose rather he has a way of making an old joke new and he really got into the characters and added depth to them in 6 issues which is more than some on-going writers haven't been able to do . The art's nice too, not a 5 but a strong 4 star effort."
3,Rockin' instrumentals!,"The instrumentals on this album really rock. Lots of neat sounds, a good beat to them, plus some wacky yet gorgeous riffs as well. If you like Evanescence you will probably like the Gathering as well, since the sound is similar. I must say I like the Gathering better, due to a more talented band and vocalist. My biggest complaint is that the vocals are extremely repetitious, especially on track 1,2, and 4. It's just the same darn riff over and over again, sometimes with a little embellishment here or there, but overall the same thing. You'll think to yourself, ""hmm, I could have sworn I just heard this exact riff on track 2..."" That part really bugs me about the album. Sometimes I'd rather just hear the instruments without the vocals. Maybe some people don't mind the repetitive vocals as much as I do, and to them I apologize for weighing down the star rating on this item, but I have rarely come across lyrical singing with so little variation."
4,A must,"This resource is a must for anyone studying the prevalance of slavery throughtout human developmant, unto the present day. Could of had a little more in regards to English involvement in the slave trade of Africa and West Indies."
4,Handy Little Gadget,"I use this potato ricer for making spaetzle. It is sturdy and allows the batter to come out in the size I wanted. I just wish it had a clip on the side to anchor it to the pot. Maybe I need a third arm, or perhaps I need to make my batter thicker. It's still a nice little product to have around. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,The best to do business with.,"Very reliable,right on time as they promise and their services is very fast.You can always trust their business."
5,Every American should read this,"Dr. King's ""Why We Can't Wait"" is a remarkable book. The chapter containing the famous ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" is one of the great political, religious and social works humanity has ever produced. If you read nothing else about the civil rights movement, or about Martin Luther King, this letter will show you why it was the right thing to do, why he won a Nobel Peace Prize, and why America (and the world) is a better place because King lived.Every American should read two documents: The Constitution and ""The Letter from Birmingham Jail."""
4,one of the best Westlake books you will find,"I really enjoyed reading this latest Dortmunder book. Westlake is complicating his plots further and further as he progresses in the series and it really adds to what other wise would be a whole lot of hot air. I totally dis-agree with the other reviewers here giving this book five stars. ""Watch Your Back"" is a fun book but it does not stand up to classics like Chandler or Jim Thompson. I think that even Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiasson have a few books between themselves that easily out shine this story. But all of my belly-aching aside, if you have read most of the rest of this series and are looking forwards to catching up with old friends like I was, this will be a satisfying novel. Just don't expect anything new here."
1,Not the right product,Vendor had the product mixed up with another item (shower plate.)I received the shower plate which was useless. The vendor didhowever not charge for the item and offered a discount on anyother faucet I wanted to purchase. Since this was a projectwhich required timely completion I skipped the offer.
1,Never Got To Play,"Two computers and three upgrades later, I still haven't gotten this game to play, the video incompatibility is extreme. What looks good on the box is all that looks good. This game is money thrown away."
3,Melissa's was better...,"Just have to tell you that - I read this first, found it okay. It IS a great and easy read - full of interest, don't get me wrong - but it's just not 'the best.' - for that check out Melissa's biography. It just REALLY puts you there and is amazing with detail!"
4,Which book do you suggest then,As said by the previous reviewer who said some notes are missing in the books. Do you suggest any other book which is more precise?
2,Not sterling silver,"These are cute earrings, but not silver. They are stamped 925, but are attracted to a magnet. Otherwise, nice."
2,Muffled Headphone Sound,"Quality of construction seems OK. Not comfortable to wear if you have an average-size head. Puts too much pressure on your ears. I've tried bending the headband out to reduce the pressure, with limited success. I've been told by Skype users that I talk to that the sound is clear, so the microphone is probably pretty good. The sound quality of the headphones is pretty poor - sounds muffled and muddy. The spec claims that they have a frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. I sincerely doubt it. I would guesstimate that the high end goes up to about 12 kHz and that's about it. A good high-frequency capability is just as important for intelligible conversation as it is for music. People with certain types of hearing loss will confirm this; often, it's not the volume they have problems with, it's the high frequencies."
1,Didn't work for too long,Lasted for exactly two weeks before it stopped working. Sound quality was great just a pity about the reliability issues!
2,Disappointed,"I was not told about a fairly large dent against the earphone socket- the earphones still worked, but I would have liked to be aware of a dent in such an important place instead of being told that there were simply ""dents."""
5,Ipod Nano,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Sturdy construction and it was packed efficiently to protect it. The only negative is the instructions to operate, they're not that great. After we worked out the bugs and figured it out, it works like a charm. I'd buy it again."
4,"Fine, but annoying to turn off","Great product, easy to use, nice sound, etc. The only thing that can be annoying: turning it off. You have to press the controls ""just right"" so that it goes from Pause to Off."
5,FIVE YEARS!,"... STILL running as strong as ever... Been through my teenage years with me, and not a scratch to prove it! This has lasted me so long. Very durable and reliable. FIVE YEARS LATER! It's amazing. Now I don't have enough space on it, so need to upgrade to higher GB... Good for a younger teenager though. I'll miss my vintage pod."
5,Greatest Gadget,"I have recently purchased two I pods. This one, the 8G. As well as the 60 G Video. Both are exceptional products with excellent quality.This 8 G I pod is very compact yet potent. Eight Gigs of MP 3 music is about 2000 plus songs. Impressive!I find the quality of the playback wonderful. Plug it into my high end stereo and the result is beautiful perfectly managed sound. Plug it into a portable boom box or FM transmitted signal for car use, also great.Well worth the venture! I do recommend you read the manual while setting up. There is so much you can do with this marvel. Listen to pod casts, audio books, set sleep timers, alarm, and so much more. I like using it with i-Tunes. Down loads fast and easy. Plus keep up to date programing.Highly Recommend, (and I'm picky)..."
4,First-timer,"For a first time iPod user...I was impressed with the versitility of the unit & the ease of instilation. It didn't ""take over"" my computer which was nice & the Nano is easy to cart around. However, I do not like the small font...can we please make it bigger? Over 35's will have a hard time reading any of the iPods when they are playing in their respective docking stations or players."
5,Who wouldn't love this...,"This Nano was my first Ipod. I loved it so much, I used up all my GB and had to buy a 4gb. Though I hated the originaly headphones it came with, it's still a great product."
1,Apple SUCKS!,"Honestly, why would anyone buy any apple product when you can get any other Mp3 player that would be twice as good for half the price."
5,Excelente,"Es muy bueno, tanto en batería, como en memoria, lo único malo, es que en comparación del iPod de primera generación, éste se traba a veces, no es algo con mucha importancia, sólo hay que reiniciarlo y listo, espero que los señores de Apple se pongan a trabajar en esto."
2,iPod Nano - Alotta Hype,"I bought an iPod in April, and I was VERY excited. i had recently returned my old MP3 player and got the iPod nano for the same price. I went home, and after figuring out the library, I was ready to go.After a week however, my iPod began to ""freeze"" and the battery lasted 5 hours at most. The entire back was COVERED in scratches. One day, I put my iPod in my bookbag for only 10 minutes, being very careful with it, and it was in a side pocket. There was only a few THIN notebooks in my bookbag. When i took it out... my screen was CRACKED. from the inside. I was so angry. I tried to take it back, and apparently there was a ""dent"" in it and they would not replace it.The iPod nano's are extremely non-durable. I do NOT recommend buying one if you are even SLIGHTLY rough on such electronics."
5,Very good product.,"Very nice gift for the lady. She was very pleased. I would recommend a good arm strap to use it when doing exercise. Do not buy the very cheap ones, the do not have the apropiate holes for the cables."
3,nano is not as shiny as nano,nano 8gb.. first..its black..not ipod-like..sound has room for improvement..my ipod-mini is a sound-giant compared to nano 2nd-generation...
5,Amazing gadget !,"I love this product. Excellent sound and size. I bring it to work everday and I never had any problem with the battery life. I wish I bought the 4GB one. It only comes in a USB charger which really sucks! But anyway, still an amazing gadget !"
5,Must Have for music lovers!,"This ipod is the best yet. i love how you can listen to music and play games! I just recived mine for christmas today and i didnt even have to read the manual, it is so easy to understand."
1,"Terrible experience with SAL ADAMS, INC","I NEVER received this product I purchased. Now, I am going through the pain of trying to get my gift certificates reimbursed and the extra money BACK into my account. I tried contacting the seller MANY times with no response. Amazon was great and very understandable, but SAL ADAMS, INC. is a joke."
3,I pod Nano,the produt tends to Frezze up after a recharge. you must be very careful when you unplug from USB after charging
1,Garbage.,Total garbage...When I finally got it in mail turned it on and screen flickering on and off ..and now not even playing songs
1,Piece of crap,"The iPod acted-up a bit from the beginning, but worked so I didn't worry about it. Two months later it stopped working altogether. Ocean Reef Electronics refuses to allow me to return it for a refund."
5,awesome,"this is a very good mp3 player. First of all its very small and lightweight. Second it holds about 1,000 songs."
4,Pleased.............,I was shocked as to how quickly this arrived. The condition was better than expected. This was a gift so timing was everything!
3,Ipod Review,"Very nice but mine has a few flaws, it shuts off/freezes randomly at times, it's not a very serious thing but it is a small agravation, I have to either let the battery run down or plug it back into the PC."
3,Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Blue,Fast serves grate help won thing I do not like is that Apple 4 GB iPod Nano head seat is trash and cant use the iPod
2,Not as great as it's made out to be,"I didn't know that there were so many versions of this thing until I bought one. I've ended up with cases for iPod nano's that wont fit the one that I have because I didn't know they had different generations of them. This one has a video screen but it doesn't play videos, found that out too late also.It doesn't take much to make this thing lockup or freeze up. And then it's hard to get it working again. Overall if I had a chance to do it over again I definitely would NOT buy this one for my first iPod."
4,I love this NANO - hate the earbuds....,The unit itself is amazing and I have no complaints with the exception of the earbuds. Apple can not design a quality earbud system. The earbuds will fall out with any movement and the sound is terrible. I did have to purchase a quality earbud system to compliment the Nano. You would think for what Apple charges for these Nano's they would upgrade the earbuds.
5,ipod nano,"Excellent choice, excellent price and on time shipping. The ipod is the greatest invention ever made and its small but tough."
3,had one got stolen,had one for about 3 months before it got stolen. worked great esily portable can fit in a pocket.bad partspin wheel is WAAAYYYY to sensitive it takes about 1/25th a turn to move a spot down so if your not moving the wheel with it under a magnafying glass youll go way over.battery life lasts a few hours. and you HAVE to use I tunes. i have never used a worse media maker than itunes it tries to make things esier by doing everything it thinks youd do and it fails BAD.get a old outdated version of itunes liek a 2003 one. and youll be good.
3,Nano 1g VS Nano 2g,"I have a 4gb first gen Nano, it has been perfect for a year and a half.Recently decided the ""upgrade"" to the second gen 8 gb Nano. It wasn't an upgrade.problems1. slower USB2 transfers2. 5 lockups in the first week.3. Many mp3s that played fine on the 1g DO NOT PLAY on the second gen model. It shows the info and title and then just skipes them"
3,"Big name, average performer","I thought Apple Ipod was the best in industry, but after owning the product for almost a year and comparing its performance with other players in the market it seems it is in inferior product with regard to its mp3 playing properties. Good looking, lacklustre performance."
4,"Good, but outdated","This does not compare to something like the current nano or touch, but it is still great for music. It is compact, although the maximum 8 GB Capacity is quite limiting without sacrificing sound quality. It is easy to use and bring with you, but a newer iPod would be better for most people."
2,should have been is desc.,this ipod i bought had scraches all over and stickkers on it. It also smelleed like smoke and the plate is loose
5,So easy to use,I had an IPOD years ago and I hated it! This is my first one since then and it is truly the easiest MP3 player I ever had. My opinion of Apple has turned around completely. Thank you!
4,Silver Jukebox Gem,"If you want to carry some music with you - but not all your tunes in your big iPOD - this is the answer - excellent bright screen, sharp images, small, lightweight, easy to use - I have heard it scratches easy - not if you put protectors on it right away!!!"
2,Major issues - Freezing and skipping songs!,"Nowadays, it is very common to throw unfinished software on the market letting us, the users to beta- or even alpha-test the product. And the software is IPod's major issue, because the hardware is really sweet! I love the design and I love the handling too, but the firmware is total crap! Because, like I wrote in the title, my iPod having the firmware ver. 1.1.1 (which is not 1.0) installed, skips and freezes at songs that are ripped from original cd's or downloaded with iTunes. The forums on [...] are full with exactly this kind of complains - now, I'm asking myself, are there ANY developer tests in the Apple house before a bugfix is released?Do we really have to wait before we buy ANY product that has software installed until the Service Pack 2 comes out?Anyway thank you, Apple for providing me such a beautiful player, which skips so many songs!"
4,I love it as much as my shuffle!,"I upgraded from the old style shuffle to an 8GB Nano...I basically wanted the extra storage space, and a screen. The Nano has done everything that I want it to, and more, so far. My husband wanted me to look into other brands, but I really like the engineering of Apple products...once it was home and out of the box, he realized it's full potential. The only complaint that I would have is that Apple is generally a bit overpriced. I also really wanted to purchase the red Nano from the apple website, but after shipping I would have spent about $50 more on it than the black one that I got on Amazon.Overall, great product :)"
4,iPod lives up to my expectations,"If you like to listen to music, and love, as I have come to love, the convenience of podcast subscriptions, iPod is a great product. I use mine all the time at home and while travelling. It makes bringing my digital music files simple to carry along, and the iPod nano is a well designed product. I will buy another one in future that has more memory, but my 2GB nano has plenty for what I need it for at the moment. I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an MP3 player!"
5,Heaven,"When it comes to high tech toys.. I am lost. When I received my Nano yesterday I was a little concerned because there was no GIANT manual. It pretty much said.. hook up to your computer and go to the apple web site. Once I got there it was relatively easy. I am very happy with my NANO, the itunes site is very easy to use and convenient. Dont let previous reviews that are written by obvious frustration sway you away from this great device. I am a runner and I have found a whole new world of music and podcasts dedicated to runners. I am in heaven!"
3,Not as good as G1,"I recently purchased a G2 iPod nano and was disappointed with the quality of the new device. There is a reason why these are $50 cheaper than G1. The body is flimsy and there appears to be no improvement in battery life. In addition, the nano I purchased gets locked up and freezes for prolonged periods of time. I will be returning it."
5,Bennissimo!,"Llegó perfectamente, en tiempo y completo. El equipo es muy bueno. Simple de gran capacidad y con buen sonido"
1,Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White,I have done research on Apple Ipods and have found that within one or two weeks they have to be sent back because they broke of just flatt out stopped working.
4,"A great product, with great features.","I have been using this ipod for the last few weeks, it is very satisfactory, easy to use and has great features."
4,Is a good Product,"Ipod ys the best betwee the audio video,players , this have the best resolution, you can travel with it sweeting of a movie.I suggest to buy one if you can, you wont regret."
1,"Wow, it has a sleek look..... But it's a piece of junk.","I bought the Ipod Nano just a week ago, and already it froze up! Now all I can see is the Apple logo whenever I turn it on. And I've now searched for days about how to fix it. I really don't see what all this hype is about the Ipod... So I sent this garbage back in and got a real trusty MP3 player called the Zen V by Creative, which I heard was real good recently.Creative Zen V Plus 8 GB Portable Media PlayerThere's a link for it, and if you're like me and your Ipod froze up, look into it."
4,Good the second time,"The first unit wouldn't power up. Amazon shipped a new one that worked perfectly and shipped the defective unit back at no charge. Would have been nice to get it right the first time, but the replacement service and follow-up was excellent."
2,"Small, but annoying","Wheels are very small; harder to use compare to HDD ipod.Scratch problem is just horrid.Typical ipod sound quality, slightly less output than 4th gen ipods, but same clarity of sound."
3,ipod nano 2nd generation,"Unfortunately, this product froze on my daughter after three weeks of use. Luckily, she let the battery run out and when she recharged, it unfroze. We heard this happens often. Also purchased one last year for my other daughter and we were 24 days too late past the warranty period to get it fixed. She was away at school and it was exam time so no one did anything with it until after the holidays. We can't send it anywhere and the Mac stores won't even look at it. I'm out $189 and she's out an Ipod. Sad"
2,good for what it does,"I purchased this because everyone else seemed to be happy with theirs. It is solid, and has an nice interface. My problems with it are as follows - it has less features then nearly every other mp3 player on the market, and you can not change the battery with out having apple do it for you (it costs as much as the nano to have it replaced). Batteries only last a few years, so this item is really a consumable. If you dont care about the many features that most other players (of nearly the same size) have (radio, voic recording, etc..) and you dont care that it has a limited life then get it. The build quality, and interface are nice.Pros: well built, and nice interfaceCons lacks features, limited life"
4,An Upgrade Is Wise,"I was not sure I got such a great deal with a 1 G iPod, so I returned it and for $50 more got the same thing only with twice the memory (2 G). Because I still feel the ear buds are `tinny' sounding and inconvenient, I bought a nice lightweight pair of snug headphones. Solved that problem. As for the small size problem, I ended up leaving it in my jeans and washing it! Guess what! It still works, which is a major kudos to Apple from a PC person. So, I purchased a protecting case, which makes it a little larger. Now, I also get 500 songs instead of less than 250. You'll still need to buy a magnifying glass to read the serial number, but this idiot found out that the number is on the outside of the box! Lessons can be learned!"
4,Much improved upon,"The second generation Ipod Nano is a definite improvement over its original predecessor. The color choices are nice and the new aluminum-coated outside is great for protection, especially for those that will use this item solely for exercise purposes. The improved battery life is also great--unfortunately, it still doesn't last as long as Apple claims, but it lasts much longer than the original Nano did. The improvements make this item worth purchasing."
5,FANTASTIC,I dont know what to say im 11 and im a bit of an advanced reader. I read Tom Clancy and understand it so i have a good sense of a good book. Well this book i read in one day for me it was light but it was one of the most enjoyable books i have ever read. If you want a good read this is ur book.
5,Awesome Book!,"I loved this book! It was really cool to get both points of view from the main characters in the book. Normally in books like that I don't like them a lot but Wendelin Van Draanen wrote this extremly well. I would give this 500 stars but you can only give 5. I would reccomend this book to anyone how is looking for a cute, romance story."
3,Flipped - a lived out novel by every teen,"""All I knew was that he had the most beautiful eyes I'd ever seen and that his smile melted my heart like the sun melts butter. But now I know that inside he's a coward and a sneak."" You can read more about Bryce and Julianna and how their feelings for each other changed completely in Flipped by Wendlin Van Draanen.Julianna Baker and Bryce Loski met in second grade when Bryce moved into Julianna's neighborhood. Immediately Julianna fell in love with him and Bryce tried to avoid her at all costs. This book is about how their thoughts and feelings for each other twisted and changed all the way through grade school. This book also involves 6 chickens, a tree, a nursing home, lots of eggs, a charming grandfather, and much much more.I liked this book, but it did get boring at parts. I do not recommend this for boys, it is more of a girls book, however some guys might find it interesting. This book is realistic fiction."
3,~Flipped~,"Flipped was a pretty good book, but it was kind of confusing. I also didnt like how it kept you hanging at the end of the book. For me to give it 4 stars, Wendelin Van Draanen would have to write another one finish upo the story."
5,I Flipped Over This Book!,"Flipped is the first time I have ever read where an author lets you see the same story from two perspectives. Bryce thinks Juli is an annoying brat destined to make a fool of herself. Meanwhile, Juli feels that Bryce needs protecting and places herself in positions to ease him pain from his mistakes. The neighbors grow up and finally realize that the person across the street is not who they thought they were. You will not regret purchasing this novel."
5,Awesome!!,"This book is a totally awesome book that teaches us the hardships when growing up.I think Wendelin did a great job making this book different from other teen romance books but made it with a twist.I am sure that Wendelin's books would soon be a hit.It deserves to be put into film.The book has emotional moments and laughing moments for whoever is reading the book.It is a book for all teens that love comedy,a little bit of romance.Way to go Wendelin Van Draanen!!!!!!"
4,Flipped,"Jullanna has liked Bryce since the day he moved in next door, and that was in second grade. And now their in eight grade. But one day when Jllanna was in the libary, she heres Bryce talking about her uncle that is mental and she gets mad at Bryce. The next day Jullan is about to go to school when her neighbor remembers that she didn't pay Jullanna for the eggs that she brings over to her. So she slips some money into Jullannas pocket and she goes to school. Luckly for Jullanna today is the Basket Boy Bet Off and Bryce is one of the people to get betted off. She wants to bet on Bryce but then the boy that she voted for to be basket boy gets betted off and no one bets for him, so Jullanna steps up and bets all of her money on Jon. So he doesn't get embarressed because no one betted for him."
4,flipped,"I thought that this book really showed a simple, kiddy love story, and much more. Since fay one Bryce Loski had thought Juli Baker was odd, even before he got to know her.Now, Juli on the other side is a very intelligent, unique, fourteen year old girl who doesn't care about what others' think and with that, is able to do as she pleases.I love the way the author tells the story in the different point of views of the characters. It really showed me how two different people and sexes can obtain and perceive the same knowledge, and translate it a completely different way thus making problems.I think that we should take more out of this book than just a middle school romance. I think we should point out the growing the two characters have been through, and those things that they have done have made them who they are today."
2,"A great story, but sprinkled with vulgarities","Juli and Bryce, neighbors since the second grade, become entangled in a a true-to-life struggle of changing emotions that are all too familiar to adolescents. In a seesaw switch of chapters, each told by one of the characters, we are privy to two distinct points of view. Unique family styles and interactions are contrasted. Flipped should be one of the best new novels for our middle schoolers, but with the many instances of vulgar language and interjections using the name of God, I find it unacceptable as a model for our children who suffer negative consequences for using the same language. We must demand more for our children if we are going to expect more from them. In searching for a similiar book with clean language, you would do well ordering All the Way Home by Patricia Giff."
2,Not To Flipped Over Flipped,The charactrs didnt act realistic. They acted as if they where these big balls of emotion. The only thing I liked was that they told both sides of the story; Julianna's side/Bryce's side.
5,Great book!,"The book was titled ""used"" but I could not tell nor could anyone else. Sometimes you can find a good used book for little money and see that it's just as good as new!"
3,A girl from PA,"I just finished reading this book. I didn't like the beginning, but as I moved along it got a little better. I think this would be a good book for 13- and 14-year olds because the two main characters, Bryce and Julianna, are that age. It could be read by boys or girls but it has a little more of a girly flavor. Overall this book to me was okay; it wasn't the greatest I've read but it will do for a rainy day or two."
2,Flipped,"When I bought Flipped I expected a love story about to poeple who at first liked each other as friends but then changed their relationship to like/love. Boy, borders really screwed their summary up. I hadnt known it was a humorous novel. I must say it was boring....very boring. Byrce didnt know if he liked Juli or not. He didnt know if he wanted her around or not. And when Juli would write her chapter she changed how Bryce reacted from what Bryce had written. (Ex. Bryce: When she found the eggs were not broken i just yelled "" We're......Juli: When I saw the eggs were not broken he just looked down at the floor..."" ) It got VERY Annoying"
4,Loved it!,This is a SUPER cute novel! Specially if you are a 12- 15 year old girl. I already read the novel 3 times!
5,Flipped,"I thought this book taught a very good life lesson. People may consider a person on the way they are on the outside, but not Julianna Baker. She went below the surface and tries to look at someone on the inside and who they really are, not who they seem to be."
4,Changes,"This book I would describe as fun book to read. The book starts off with these two people. The girl's name is Julie, and the boy's name is Brice.Julie luves Brice, but Brice cannot stand her. Julie just cannot see that Brice dos not like her. Brice thinks that JulieBaker is the most annoying person in the world. This goes on for a long time, but then Julie finally relizes Brice does not like her because Brice makes fun of Julie uncle who is mentaly retarded.Then it is all flipped when Brice likes Julie , but Julie cannot stand because of what he did. All brice wants to do is look at her beutiful face. At least that is what he thinks.This book is really inspiring. It teaches people not to make fun of other people. If you are looking for a love story this is your book."
4,awesome sounds,"These are great sounds, trippy and groovy, but with a touch of class. Well, maybe not the song with porn-like moans in terms of class. This is 60's bachelor music, the real deal.My biggest complaint is that this thing only runs 36 minutes. In a day an age where only the devout still buy CD's, it is not helpful to have that ""that was IT?!?!?"" feeling. The other way to look at that is I wanted more! I assumed based on the track listing that I had at least 1 hour of material for my purchase.I got the 1996 version and I have a feeling that better versions may exist, yet recordings from that period should have a certain ""charming dirt-like quality,"" so I would love to A/B them some time."
5,"IF THE ENERGY THERAPY WEREN'T SCIENTIFIC,","I WOULD CALL IT MAGIC !!!I know it sounds so simple... But the best things of life are as simple as Penicilin, that grew from the mold of a piece of bread !This is ASTOUNDING...The best THERAPY BOOK IN THE WORLD!You try it, you never leave it !"
4,The Pessimist Spits these Pointed Words,"Basically this ep is the ep before there was ""Dreaming Neon Black"" album came out. If you like Dreaming Neon Black, you will most likely like this EP. It does however have a heavier sound to it on the the first track, but thats short lived. 1. Optimist or Pessimist - A song about how the end of the world is coming and both the Optimist and Pessimist now it, yet they respond differently. . . . 90%2. Matricide - A song about how we are killing Mother Earth. . . . 95%3. In Memory - Speaking of falling back on memories when theres nothing left to hold on to. . . . 90% 4. Silent Hedges/Double Dare (2 Bauhaus Covers) - Cool covers. Interesting spin on the songs. . . . 90% 5. Sorrowed Man - A uplifting song. Very powerful soft song. . . . 95% If you like his EP, also check out: Nevermore- Dreaming Neon Black, Nevermore- Nevermore, Nevermore- Dead Heart in a Dead World, Nevermore- The Politics of Ecstasy."
3,"Good stuff, but lacking in some sense...","The only bands that really made an impression were Stuck Mojo, Sentenced and Nevermore. The rest of them seem lost in a way. Sentenced crafts beautiful melodies, sounding sometimes like a true heavy metal ballad !! But the one single track tha t totally blew me away was Nevermore. 'Seven Tongues of God' is really one of the most awesome metal song I've ever heard !! The musicianship of the band is simply amazing. I'm getting their album right away !!"
1,THESE SUCK!,"THESE SHEETS SUCK, WHEN I WAS PUTTING THE FITTED SHEET ON MY BED IT CAME UNDONE, IT WAS LIKE WAY TO SMALL OR SEWED WRONG OR SOMETHING. I DON'T RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE, THE FABRIC IS NICE HOWEVER, BUT DIDN'T FIT MY BED."
3,Very slippery sleep,"It's nice and cool in touch; however does not stay well on the mattress. Every night before going to bed we have to prep the sheets and in the morning half of the sheet is off the mattress. I give 5 for visual effect, but 2 for convenience, therefore 3 stars total."
5,Luxury and Pop Dreams,What can be said? Instrumental Dreaming ... every trackputs you in a 60s-70s movie trailer..a great way tostart any day...A must cd...
5,Sludge True To The Core...,"I have to admit, I have not always been an Eyehategod fan. But after listening tho Down's 'Nola' (one of the finest recrodings ever) I had to check them out. So I bought this. Holy Sh-t. This is just perfection in every sense of the word. This has got to be one of the best records of all time. The guitars, the vocals, the bass, the everything about this band is just perfect. Though I have bought 3 more Eyehategod albums since this one, they don't quite mach up with it. I mean songs like ""Zero Nowhere"" (my personal favorite), ""Methanphetamine"", ""Ruptured Heart Theory"" and ""Non Conductive Negative Reasoning"" are some of the best metal recordings of all time. There is no way in hell that this album should be passed up. I would recomend this to everybody. Rock on...-MC"
5,For granddaughter,She Loves it!!! She watches it all the time. She is 5 years old and loves Barbie movies. Thats all
5,BARBIE CHRISTMAS CAROL,"Perfect for a little girl who wants to be a Princess. My grandaughter loved it. The colors and animation are beautiful, mesmerizing."
2,Not for everybody,When I saw the movie for the first time I thought it was gonna be an instant classic but I was wrong. I watched it with my family and they didn't enjoy it. Barbie in a Christmas Carol isn't as good as the other barbie movies.
3,Good but not the best,My kid loved it but somehow I felt that it was not one of the DVD's that she wants to see again n again. Overall a good buy for that price.
1,Didn't like it,The CD didn't contain the original recordings I had anticipated. I had hoped that it would contain some original recordings...not remakes.
2,this guy is wack,"Gangsta rap????? What ever happened to the real gangsta rappers-- scarface, well, he's about the only one who is left other than the late 2 pac and biggie smalls. This guy came out with a song entitled ""HA,"" and he has only gotten a little better. if you ask me, he is nothing but a 2-pac replica who can't measure up to 2pac in any way. in short, I'd rather listed to Fluff (Puff) Daddy."
3,his new album is 336 times better,"The cd isnt that bad.Ja has definately matured more on his new album.He has tried hooking up with so many difrent people.*This* album is i dont know just not all that.I like ""i cry""and put it on me is way played out along with ""between me and u"" and most the others are jus dumb.The album isnt my favorite of ja's collection.His new album is much more creative with better beats and difrent varieties.I definately suggest buying his new album and not this one"
1,"Disgusting, Foul, Putrid, Shameful Garbage","This is vile and downright blasphemous. Why do you need to use so much vulgar language?! This is just plain SICK!!!!! Ja Rule has no taste; only SICK fantasies. If you listen to this and enjoy it, listen to the words more closely. FOUL! SICK! DISGUSTING!"
2,Save your money,"This CD is weak. I admit that it does have some good song's on it but there are more songs that will be skipped. Whatever song you liked that made you want to go out and buy this CD (which in my case was put it on me) you may as well go and buy the single. Put it on me wasn't the same without lil' mo on it and with out her adlib on the course the song seems to drag on. I wish that i could get me [money] back from tower records, but it's to late for me. I would advise anybody considering purchsing this CD to go download it or burn a friend's copy just don't waste your money on this"
5,ja's number one fan,"in case you didn't know, anythang with the name JA'RULE in or on it is going to be the bomb so don't settle for antthang less than the BOMB. Anywho, back to the CD this album is DA'BUMB he is so hard core but then again passionate in his lyrics he seems as though he speaks his mind and that's what i like most about his Sexy @$$ whoa buddy knows he is gorgeous and just to hear his voice gets me excited. Ja knows i'm his number one and only FAN WHO LOVES ALL OF HIS WORK WHO HAS ALL CD'S BY HIM IF THE SONG HAS HIM IN IT BETTER BELIEVE I HAVE IT CAUSE WHEN...>>> JA CRIES KEI CRIES WE'LL CRY TOGETHA YEA' YEA' OOOH! WE'LL CRY TOOGETHA!!!!"
2,Can You Say 2pac imitation?,"Ja Rule has a couple of good songs,but he sounds just like Pac,and he steals his flows,he just robbed Pac of evrything,if Pac was alive he'd hate this guy.If you want good music chack out Nelly,or Eminem,or old Snoop and Dre stuff,or anything Tupac.JUst not ja rule."
2,Music is allright!,"If you like real tight music, check out Delusion by Quentin's Ladder and Deiselboy's Project Human!"
5,coming strong,"RULE 3:36 IS THE BOMB. THE FIRST ALBUM WAS GREAT, BUT THIS ONE SHOWS HE'S HAPPY. THERE ARE MORE PARTY SONGS AND IT'S MORE LAID BACK. WHEN YOU COME HARD ALL THE TIME THAT SHOWS YOU HAVE LIMITED TALENT. RULE 3:36 SHOWS JA HAS MORE TALENT AND THAT HE CAN RHYME ABOUT MORE THAN THUG LIFE. THIS CD IS RAW FROM THE BEGINNIG TO THE END. THIS IS JA LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. HE IS RAW AND HE WILL STAY THAT WAY. GO COP IT!"
5,movie,"We used this movie in conjunction with teaching Two Old Women. The students were riveted. One even remarked, ""This is the best movie I never heard of!"""
4,A nice surprise among the bigger name films,"This is a very nice film about man who has a positive life changing experience via a potential disaster. The performances are very good by most of the cast, and the scenery is terrific. I personally enjoyed the fact that the film makers didn't feel the need to explain every little thing in the film, and therefore left a lot to my imagination.Barry Pepper shows that he has what it takes to be a major actor, and he really carries the show. His character is someone who isn't very likeable in the early part of the film, but who becomes a much more likeable person as he responds to events around him. I found myself pulling for both his character and that of Annebella Piugattuk.I don't want to give anything away, but I will warn you that those who like Hollywood endings, with all loose ends neatly wrapped up, will probably be disappointed. This is a very well made film that tells a very good story while leaving some loose ends for you to ponder."
5,earl,BEST BUY OF THE YEAR COOK BOOK LEAVES A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED BUT AS FOR FUNCTION IT IS TERRIFIC
4,Good way to cook fast and healthy,"I've always wanted to pressure cooker but was afraid because of those scary stories about it exploding. But I found this one to be safe because it is electronic and has timer. I used it to cook pork chops (9 minutes under high pressure), chicken soup (15 minutes) and also pig feet (chinese dish, 15 minutes from frozen to cooked tender). Each time, the result was quite good. One word of advice, follow the instruction and do not put too much water. I did that once and when I tried to quick release the pressure, not only the steam came out, the hot water as well. But that's really a user error because I ignored the instruction. Cannot wait to cook some hummus and bean soup."
5,Easy cooking,I am very pleased with my purchase of the Cuisinart Electric Presure cooker it is so easy to prepare a meal and not have to stay in the kitchen.I got really good service from Amazon my order was here in a few days.
4,It's great,"This is going to be short -- thanks to all of you that gave a review on this pressure cooker, we bought it and can't be happier. I agree with all the positive things people have said about it. I did learn that you need to make sure your pressure valve is in the ""pressure"" position and not ""pressure release"" or you won't get up to full pressure!:-)Anyway, it's great and you won't be disappointed in any way!"
3,cusinart pressure cooker,"The basic directions are incorrect on how to operate the unit. The manual tells you topress start after the menu is set, but you set the time next and then press start. If youdon't do it correctly, all you get is 1 minute cook time. Needs corrected."
5,Cuisinart CPC-600 Pressure Cooker,"After years of using different types of pressure cookers, the Cuisinart CPC-600 is by far superior to any other one I used in the past. Everything has been processed with the best results in the shortest period of time. The unit is well-built, easy to use and easy to clean. I couldn't be happier."
5,cuisinart pressure cooker,"great product! works as advertised. I have use the Cuisinart pressre cook a dozen times since I recieved it and it is now a part of my kitchen 'gadgets'. Time is greatly reduced in preparing meals, and the results are so much better then the traditional method of cooking.Follow the time recommendations listed in the booklet and you will not have any problems."
5,Great cooking tool!,This pressure cooker is easy to use and even easier to clean. It does a great job on meats and vegetables. We cook most of our meats this way.
4,really convenient.,much easier to use than a conventional pressure cooker. just set the timer and it automatically turns off. it makes no noise which is great when you have sleeping kids. it also frees up the stovetop if you want to cook other things simultaneously. the only thing is that it does take a lot longer to brown than using a saucepan on the stovetop.
3,Trouble,I love the way the cooker works butI'm having a hard time trying to get it to seal and hold pressure
1,unit does not work,I have had two cuisinart pressure cookers shipped to me. the first one cooked for on week and then quit working. The second was delivered today and it does not turn on. I have tried to work with Amazon customer service and can not believe it. I always shopped with Amazon because of their customer servce. Now you talk to someone in India who does not have a clue. Amazon is a total disappointment. I have been on hold waiting for a supervisor for 20 min!!
2,Pressure cooker review,It took too long to heat up and if the pressure release valve is not exactly positioned it will not heat up.It did not meet my expectations having owned an Presto electric cooker 25 years ago.
5,Take pressure off yourself and put it on your food!,"This purchase was a gift to one of my colleagues. One year ago I received one just like this as a gift. I love how easy it is to use. This is unlike older pressure cookers with the scary rocking device that spewed steam and hot water. This one just quietly sits there and does its job. I can make a luscious soup in practically no time and it will stay perfectly hot until I'm ready to eat. Dried beans and lentils are a snap to make. I simply rinse the beans or lentils, add broth, chopped onion, celery, and carrots, toss in bay leaves, set the minutes recommended by the recipe (or the booklet), and walk away. I especially like having the different temperatures (in addition to high and low pressure, there's brown, simmer, and keep warm) so all the browning and caramelizing can take place in one appliance. I recommend this to anyone who wants to prepare delicious, nutritious, fast meals. Finally, when it's all over, clean up is a breeze."
5,Great!,"Love it! Works great and dinner is done in minutes. Cleans up just as fast as it cooks. I Have no complaints as of now, and don't think I will find any."
4,GREAT PRODUCT...SO FAR SO WELL!!!,"After having had a very unpleasant experience with the DENI-9760 Pressure Cooker I'm delighted to havepurchased the Cuisinart CPC-600 Series. I've used it only a couple of times since I just received it. I can't be more positive enough if it continous to function this well. What a roast I made the other day;even my wife,who is a gourmet chef,marveled over my creation. Had one minor problem with the pressure seal which Cuisinart Customer Service remedied immediately (otherwise 5 stars would be in order). Onlywished I could get my wife to quit being afraid of this thing. She keeps telling me about an explosionshe witnessed on a conventional pressure cooker. Maybe somebody out there can convince her how safe this thing is so I won't have to do all the cooking!!! LOL! Thanx Amazon for guiding me to this product."
1,Defective design.,"After seeing all of the rave reviews, I decided to buy this pressure cooker. The first one was defective and never did seal. The instructions and service line were horrendous. I figured it must be a fluke since so many people seemed to be so in love with their cooker so I sent it back and bought another one- same problem. There won't be a third time."
3,"I like cooking with this, sans rust!","Those 2 customer images belong to this review.I have had this for a year, used it like 15 times. Now I see this rust seeping from inside the lid. What? Where is that coming from? Is it getting on my food?I opened it up. Totally gross. Hello quality control? Hello design team? Hello bad attitude towards screw-ups?Someone at Cuisinart must have known about this. This is disgusting. If I were smart I could come up with some other words.Otherwise it works well. I like it. So much so that I will go find the screw in a stainless version and repair it.Revised: Now what is that little thing even there for? I'll try it without it and see. It seems useless. Maybe it's there to generate service requests. It's not labeled on the Parts and Features section of user manual. WTF"
2,Disappointing,"Having been a fan of pressure cookers for years, my wife loved this product originally. She used it 3 times with no problems in the first month, then it stopped working. It wouldn't pressurize. We followed all of the problem-solving hints but to no avail. Amazon was outstanding in that they provided a full refund plus postage. However I was on the hook for UPS packaging and insurance, which cost me $30. So much for a great deal. Kudos to Amazon but frowns to Cuisinart. I'm afraid now to re-order an electric one."
2,"Mostly boring, improbable ending","Normally I enjoy slow, deep character development, but these characters just did not seem all that interesting. The plot was PAINFULLY drawn out, like watching grass grow, and then all of a sudden it turns into an action movie ending. Very strange. First of his books I have read, and it doesn't make me interested in trying any of his others."
3,listen before buying,"I don't like Moonspell. They play an extremely generic sort of gothic metal that is not particularly complex, not particularly mediaeval in influence, not particularly melodic,...not particularly anything. The vocals are also some of the worst in metal, and the lyrics are often goofy.That having been said, ""Irreligious"" is probably Moonspell's best album. If you are interested, start here, but I recommend checking out sound files on the Century Media website first.I have a feeling that most people who like Moonspell only do because they are on a ""major"" label and are not familiar with truly classy gothic metal. Compare this stuff to any My Dying Bride (OK, except the uncharacteristic 34% album) and you will never want to listen to Moonspell again. Or for that matter, look into Haggard, Dreams of Sanity, Theatre of Tragedy,...all of them much classier than Moonspell and just more interesting."
2,NOT SO GREAT STUFF!!!,Sounds like the by-product of Type-O Negative's tour bus colliding with Dream Theater's tour bus with more of Type-O's guys surviving!!! Would be better with Christian lyrics.
1,ADDICTED TO MUSIC,I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM COULD BRING SOMETHING NEW TO THIS STYLE OF MUSIC BUT EVERYTHING HERE HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.
4,Did I get Gyped?,"I love the album, but wheres the second disc amazon describes? I was disappointed to find out the second disc wasn't included :("
3,similarities...,"Agutin's voice is so similar to Sting's. And the guitar sounds so much like Santana!Not very original, but anyway, cool, nice, calming album."
4,Brillant,"I grew up with Al's music (Splendido Hotel, Kiss my Axe, Casino etc... I have it all) and I like Santana as well, but you gotta know the difference. I heard this album only once but I know, it is my new favorite... and I am sure my wife's going to like it as well. I can't play Chick Corea all the time. I need a break and this is a good one. Very nice pop-album! Highly recommended for those who think ""jazz is a bit messed up music""... Listen to this first and then go for Al's other works.Santana has one album: The Best of Santana. He reissues it every year with a different album art and pretty much the same songs. Those dsongs are good, but how can you compare to such a creative musician like Al Di Meola?"
1,Oscar sure is handsome!,"Wow... I saw him on tv (in Spanish) for commercials, and I was like who is that?? and my little brother tells me he is a boxer. Wow a cute latino boxer. Next he comes out w/ a cd!! i heard Mi Amor in Spanish, and I thought it was a fun tune and decided to buy teh whole cd, there are a few good songs on it, nad he sounds like he could improve w/ his voice, but that will take time and experience. He is not that bad though... Check him out! the pics in the cd especiallY!"
2,Memphis Belle,I loved this movie when I watch it before but for some reason someone cut out some of the best parts. I guess I will just keep on the shelf.
4,The Last Flight,"Bomber crews, 10 teammates, flew 24 missions and then were rotated stateside in order to help train new crews in the ""how to's"" of their jobs and [most imortant] how to stay alive. The crew of the 'Belle', a B-17 Fortress that could dish it out as well as take it, were the first crew to do so. This is their story mainly based on their final mission. The battle scenes are good white-knucklers that will make you feel the tension, the fear and the elation of feeling the wheels finally touchdown at home base. They were snot-nosed kids of 19 years or so when they left for the war, and were seasoned men when they completed their tour.Look for Harry Connick Jr and his Big Band performance. John Lithgow is a totally despicable PR man looking to make headlines at any cost that will get the folks back home buying war bonds. And the flying sequences are outstanding!Ya gotta check it out 4yerself!Memphis Belle (Snap Case)"
3,Memphis Belle,I was disappointed in the picture quality. For a recent movie it had far too many scratches and pops in the picture. The manufacturer should have clean it up better!
2,A Corny Movie,"I found this movie to be full of cliches and concocted action. The crew behaved as if this was their first mission instead of their 25th. The documentary by William Wyler is just as exciting, a lot more accurate, and a better bargain as a film."
5,A Great Book & Story that You'll Never Put Down!,I absolutely loved this book. It had elements of mystery within the story. The question of the identity of Jack the Ripper is always in the back of your mind. I finished the book in two days! That's how good it was-- I couldn't put it down! And the ending-- it's shocking!!! Sort of like the book version of The Usual Suspects. I definately recommend it to everyone!
4,Brilliant retelling of Jack the Ripper,"This was one of Hemingway's favorite novels, and for good reason. Ms. Lowndes displays a beautiful sense of timing and suspense."
3,"The more things change, the more they stay the same . . .","Dear Ms. Rice,With the Vampire Chronicles, you have brought to your readers a better expression of the relationship between the lover and his beloved than Plato, Mann, Kundera or just about ANYONE could ever have dared to dream of creating. And you had it right all along: ALL things change, except Christ's, (excuse me, Lestat's) love for us (I mean, Louis). Timeless, sexless, beyond human comprehension, and utterly heartbreaking. You can stray away from time to time and involve yourself in frivolous pursuits (like Merrick), but please, go home: to Lestat and his immortal beloved, Louis. You know the way!"
4,Riveting & Refreshing!,"As a devout fan of The Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, Merrick, as a combination of the two, was a dream come true!I was most intrigued by Anne Rice's insight into the world of mulattos and ocotoroons and creepy Voodoo practices. Her descriptions are so vivid and on target you have to wonder if her experiences are first hand!As usual though, you have to dig out your previous ""Chronicles"" to keep up with the action-- a minor pitfall if you haven't read ""Tales of the Body Thief"" or ""Memnoch the Devil"".I was spellbound by Merrick and couldn't put it down until I had finished it in two days!! And although the ending was not what I was looking for, I immediately went online to locate all the Chronicles and Mayfair witches I didn't have.I will most likely re-read this one again and again while I anxiously await the next installment!Happy reading!"
5,A must read!,"I have to say that at first I thought, 'Oh it's not those Mayfair witches' but now I say 'WHO CARES!' This book is so much more than 5 stars, the combo of everything is great. The intro to voodoo is very interesting and I hope to read more on that subjsct from Anne. The end is the best, I cannot wait for the next, Go Anne Go!"
2,Big Disappointment,I've heard alot about Anne Rice and how rich and descriptive her writings are. This is the first book I've read of hers. I was truly disappointed in the character development and the depth of writing. I was not captivated. I was not mesmerized. I only finished it because I paid for it and I thought it would get better. I couldn't bear to read about how creamy Merrick's skin was or how green her eyes were one more time. Everything was so shallow and contrived. This work has not motivated me to buy another book written by her again.
3,Has The Magic Returned?,"I hesitated reading this book. An avid Ann Rice reader I became disenchanted soon after Queen Of The Damned, a novel I adored. The appeal of the old Vampire Chronicles and the MayFair Witches brought me to try again. Is the old magic there? Not fully. Do I recommend it? Yes. There is a sparkle of the old Ann Rice magic."
2,Was less than enthused....,"When I got Merrick I was under the impression that it dealt with the Mayfair family more directly. I didn't read Merrick right away, instead I re-read The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos so I'd be ready for what I thought was installment #4 of the Mayfair Witches.What a letdown!!! Merrick has very little to do with the Mayfair family and more to do with the Vampire stories. It re-hashes all the old Vampire woes and introduces this distant cousin of the original Mayfairs.I hope Anne Rice does another installment of the Mayfair Witches soon! I am ready for it!"
3,Enjoyable,"Like 'Pandora', this tale does not contribute much to the overall vampire world, but is a good read in its own right, with Vampires and Mayfair Witches, but not too much from either as much of the story is Merrick's own, from before soe joined the Talamasca, which was interesting because I was curious if the Talamasca would make another appearance. While not as solid as earlier Vampire Chronicles, Merrick is a interesting character and the story was a lot of fun to read. 3.5/5 stars."
2,not the best,"Although the book itself was entertaining it wasn't even close to being near the pinnicale of what Anne Rice is capable of writing at. With this book we find Loius once again as a main character along with Merrick and our old friend from The Talmasia. This book never quite able to capture the intimacy or ""Human"" aspect of the characters as Anne Rice's previous stories have. It is just another book that a great writer as written well below her capablity."
1,Disturbing Undertones,"This book is not only poorly written and a travesty to Louis fans, but it is also deeply disturbing.Anne spends a great deal of time trying to justify and explain the sexual exploitation and molestation of a minor.Child sexuality and sexual abuse have been recurring themes in a number of her books, but it really comes to the fore in Merrick.The theme is highly unsettling since she seems to want people to believe that sex with minors is normal and acceptable."
4,A fun read,"While Merrick is not an Anne Rice masterpiece by any means, it is still a fun read. After The Vampire Armand and Vittorio, which were both rather disapointing, Merrick is like a breath of fresh air. Merrick is a likable and interesting character, and what she sets out to do is very interesting! I felt unsatisfied with the ending, but that is how I usually feel after finishing one of Rice's novels. I guess they have to end sooner or later!Anyways, I don't think you can go wrong with Merrick. It's a quick read. I read the last 150 pages in one day. Paced well, interesting, and fun.. I'm hoping for something new in her next book. Something more along the lines of Violin or Servant of the Bones. Give the vampires a rest for a while! :)"
3,"not bad for a vampire book,","As a fanatic reader of the Vampire Chronics i'm quit disapointed by this book,anne rice love for detailfull descriptions of places is getting boring."
3,Exquisite Blend of all that is Mystifing,"Anne does a terrific job in tieing in her Vampire Chronicles with the Lives of the Mayfair Witches in this novel. My rating in no way reflects Annes Quality writing in this novel, because i am not a writer but a reader, and simply reflects my liking of it, for lake of a better word.Here readers will be reunited with Louis, Lestat, and even Claudia. Through Merrick and all her Worldly Powers Louis is given one last farewell with Claudia. And one of our favorite Mayfair Witches becomes a Blood Child. Filled with many ghosts, this read is fast, or at least better be if you read it at night!"
4,"Changes, Wins and Losses","I cannot be exactly sure why I like this book, as it seems (as other reviewers have noted) out of character in many ways, although I suppose the reader should not be too enamoured with the traditions of any kind of chronicles. After all, times change, and so do people and in time, I suppose, even immortals. As a piece of writing 'Merrick' is a delight, though stylish it reads very easily and the plot keeps up an atmosphere of suspense, mystery and, above all, tragedy. Characters readers have come to know and love over the past years do experience a major change in many ways, and I cannot say I welcomed all of those, but nevertheless I have to disagree with the review I read, although maybe not true in every instant to the Vampire Chronicles, it remains a carefully researched piece of literature very well worth reading."
4,Interesting,"Merrick was a interesting read, especially the last few chapters...Am anxious to see what will become of Lestat and the Talamasca. Did anyone else notice any conection between the ruins and Mekare???(Just a thought)."
2,A Let Down,"I've read all of Anne Rice's novels and loved them all, but where did this one come from? I felt Merrick lacked originality and it seemed Rice just whipped up some character to obtain her yearly paycheck. Also, the attempt to tie Merrick to the Mayfair family was pathetic and pretty much pointless other than making some sort of connection between vampire and witch.On the other hand, I was pleased that we were brought back with Louis and Lestat, but neither character seemed in form. Louis to me was completely out of character and I almost stopped reading the book due to this. I realize characters change over time but this was a completely different person (especially in the end of the novel).In all, I was pleased to see the story pick back up with my favorite duo but I felt this was one of Rice's most poorly orchestrated novels to date. I will admit the book keeps you reading for more, but I ended up only attaining a great feeling of dissapointment when I finished."
4,"Merrick, the Great","Anne Rice is a great writer and this is proof. She proves in this book that she understands what we want in a book. Merrick is a book that makes the soul rise and fall though out the book.Personally,this book is great and the use of words is outstanding.Just like many of her other great works.She choose to make the characters come alive.Great imagation thatgives this book life."
4,Like an Old Friend Returning,"I'll admit, I had grown bored with Anne Rice. Her last few have certainly lacked the wild originality and imagination of her earlier novels. Violin and Servant of the Bones were awful, Memnoch the Devil, Lasher and Taltos, ridiculous, Armand, repetitive and boring. Merrick is a good book, probably because it's a smaller book. Less time to play around with the grand IDEAS. It has characters instead of caricatures, themes that speak for themselves. It's a novel, not a diatribe. Merrick Mayfair is an attractive character, David Talbott, an attractive hero. His fears and regrets are reasonable. The plot is solid. I had determined quite a while ago that I would stop buying Anne Rice in hardcover, and I haven't yet picked up Blood and Gold, but after this, I'm hopeful..."
2,"Yep, it stinks.","I loved the witch series first and the Vampire Chronicles second. The thought of bringing the two groups of characters closer together seemed like a good concept, but this book didn't deliver. The self-absorbed characters whine endlessly. I'll try picking it up again around Halloween. However, the book looks great on the shelf. Two stars for decoration."
5,Freedom is the word,"Of the three books by Ken Eagle Feather, this one is my favorite. Each of his previous books led me up to this one - which launched me into a new way of perception. Tracking freedom is precisely what the book is about, with no wasted words. It is packed full of exercises and information that helps one along the path to freedom."
3,Good. Not great.,"Well, I expected it to be much better, but I didn't realize how low-budget it was. It's very creative, and I applaude the props people (you can buy a huge set of the props from the film at their website). It's certainly a good try. The stop-motion Cthulhu was a little disappointing I must say. But with no budget, it's better than I could have done. The city of R'lyeh is pretty cool. Good set design. It has its moments. All in all, it's worth seeing, and it's a cool idea, but it's just not great. The dvd cover is more impressive than the actual film. Sorry guys, good try. Until we get some real big-budget Lovecraft movies made, this will have to do."
3,"Watch ""In the Mouth of Madness"" Instead...please!","I went through a big Lovecraft phase, as many did...I read all of his work except his poems and correspondence. So I am more than passing familiar with his work.I was excited to see this movie, and to say I was disappointed would be more than an understatement. When I saw the movie's representation of Cthulhu, I almost had physical symptoms of nausea at the injustice the filmmakers perpetrated against HPL. I could nearly hear Ray Harryhausen roll in his grave.I would recommend this movie to use as a coaster. I've seen better infomercials. I've seen silent films (e.g. ""Metropolis"") and know they were trying* for that silent film feel, but sorry, you all did not get it.If you want real Lovecraftian horror, I recommend instead watchingIn the Mouth of Madness...which is almost 'more Lovecraft than Lovecraft'."
5,A wonderful adaptation executed with skill and style!,"This film soars, both as an adaptation of a classic horror story long deemed ""unfilmable"" and as a masterpiece of indie film-making. Through vision, dedication to the source material, and a knack for creative problem-solving, the HPLHS have created a film that raises the bar for Lovecraft adaptations to an unprecedented high. Additionally, they've rediscovered the magic of early movie-making and reawakened this viewer's appreciation of the form. Highest marks all around!"
3,A lot of fun,I am not a big Lovecraft fan but found this low (or no) budget flick to be a lot of fun. It is amazing to see what a group of dedicated fans can accomplish with a little ingenuity and creativity.
3,Not as good as previous albums,"This album marked a yet another transition in Sentenced career with the departure of singer / bassist Taneli Jarva and the introduction of new vocalist Ville.The vocals are in a rough James Hetfield style that may broaden appeal to traditional rock / metal fans. Musicaly speaking, songs have been greatly simplified in a verse-chorus rock format and use a similar formula. The pace is fast and reminiscent of Ride The Lightning era Metallica. This album is nowhere near Amok & the Love & Death EP - mainly because it falls into generic metal or dark rock.This is still a decent album and a fun listen. Highlights are: Noose, bleed, crumbling down, 0132, I'll throw the first rock."
2,Useless as a reference,"I would expect a book titled ""The Healing Powers of [some product]"" to be mainly a reference on using the product for medical purposes, but only one small section (24 pages) is directly pertinent. There are a few other comments scattered throughout the text, but without an index there's no obvious way to find them. I'm sure there must be more extensive books on this subject."
2,Okay,Too much writing not enough straight information. I would not recommend this book for home rememidies information.Not such a good buy.
3,okay,not what i thought--but still has a lot of god tips and ways that you can use vinegar--also tells about all of the different ones out there
4,Good info to know.,"Very well organized with some good information and history on ACV. Also adds info on other vinegars along with some recipes. I did think the personal bit about her parents and their alcoholism was unnecessary information for the book. We all have skeletons in our closets and there is a proper time and place to bring them out just not here. Over all a very good book. I'm looking forward to reading The Healing Powers of Olive Oil: A Complete Guide To Nature's Liquid Gold, by Ms Orey."
5,Healing Powers of Vinegar Book,Surprised to find so many uses for vinegar in food AND other than food. What did we use before vinegar?
5,awesome book with tips that work,The information is very good and useful.I would recommend it to everyone. There is all kinds of uses for vinegar..check it out!!!!!
4,Red Wine Vinegar,I was surprised that red wine vinegar has some of the same heart-healthy benefits of red wine. This is of special interest since I don't drink alcoholic drinks. I really like the natural health remedies that were in the book since I believe in natural cures. Great book and and a joy to read.
3,Powers of Vinegar,This book contained some interesting information but it didn't answer some of my questions about the application of vinegar to health issues. I'll keep it as a reference book.
2,OK For The Price,"This is an OK DVD Player for the price. But it is driving my family crazy. It is extremely sensitive about the disk being absolutely clean - difficult with a 5-year old. It often has problems loading the DVD - and sometimes will never play it. Even brand new disks may not play - my daughter's new ""Sleaping Beauty"" disk will not load up. I, (Dad) seem to be the only one who can get it to work most of the time. Oh, and don't bump the player during playback, the screen goes completely black, with the sound still playing and you have to disconnect power and start over. Good things: Very nice screen and battery life seems to be good for 3+ hours."
1,Made where?,"On this web site target.com as you can see above it says ''Made in USA.'' So when I got it it came in a box with ''made in China'' printed right on it multiple times. Also when I opened the box there were stickers on the dvd player and the battery that said it was made in china. I dont know who to contact about this but I know it is not legal. Also the warranty isnt backed by anything. There isn't anyone to contact, only an address and a website that doesn't respond to e-mails. I know because mine needed to be returned the day I got it."
1,"Looks great, sounds great, but...","This product looks great and the sound is good, but the quality is terrible. I purchased this for my daughter and it worked fine for about 2 days. After that you could play a movie, but if you wanted to change disks it would not be able to read the disk. It seems if it warms alittle and you change disk it will tell you that there is no disk. I'm taking it back. The APEX that I purchased for my other daughter works great so far and has even better sound. Sound is the biggest complaint I have heard of on most portable DVD players"
2,nice features,"It has some nice features, but over all performce wasn't well. Battery fully charged didn't get a full hour out off. Heated up pretty much when played plugged in to ac for the amount of time it took to watch 1 movie. Not practical to run off of battery.Maybe if you use in dc or ac if you don't mind the heat. Hot enough that I did not like holding on lap. But then it is not a portable dvd if you have to plug it in. I was discouraged with its ablity to work off battery. Didn't play blank recorded dvd disk to well. At first I thought disk but played in other players no problem. I sent back for refund, not because of playing of blank disk. But overall performce is not close to what advertized. Buttons did not seem like they would take alot of wear. If you are looking for something to hang on back of a car seat and plug into car for the kids to watch cartoons on and don't want to spend alot of money. Maybe this is what you want. But although it has alot of features, it lacks quality."
4,happy with my purcase,"After hearing so many bad reviews I almost changed my mid about buying this product. But it&#146;s been two months now and I haven&#146;t had a problem yet.It&#146;s all aluminum body give the small DVD player a strong and robust feeling. The speakers work just fine, of course the don&#146;t compare to my Bose 601 speakers but then again what dose; you can&#146;t expect much from 2, 1watt speakers anyway.The LCD display could use a little work but still are with acceptable parameters.Overall I found this DVD very pleasing, and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,could be better,the first one i bought i had a major problem with. it doens't play most of my dvds. whats the use of having a dvd player when it doesn't play all of your favorite dvds. i say get a diffrent brand.
1,A FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE,I heard very good reviews of the Francis X3 espresso machine. I was anxious to enjoy a good cup of coffee from this machine. But the seller: ACE Digital Club sent me a damaged machine and they refused to send me a replacement unless I paid another overpriced shipping ($100) and a penalty of 10%($50)of the price for the return of the damaged machine. Of course I choose to receive a refund (less a 10%) and look for another seller.
2,Poor quality DVD,"Poor instructor, tacky, jiggling camera, low budget, look at me not the prompter or off camera, poor sound quality, odd pauses and over all low budget low quality. Save your dollars for a better DVD."
5,"Nice sticker, GREAT seller!","There is not too much to say about the sticker...uh, it sticks! I'm pleased that it says what it's supposed to.I'm writing this because the seller deserves some credit. My stickers were lost in the mail apparently, and when I contacted the seller, they sent me another one without complaint or trouble. ""It didn't come? No problem, the post office does that occasionally. We will reship immediately!"" Thanks!"
4,"Easy to Read, Easy to Apply","As a speaker and consultant I have read countless books on leadership development. Many I find so theoretical that they are almost impossible to absorb and then apply. Leadership: Seeing, Describing, And Pursuing Whats Possible is not one of these books. I appreciated the author's simple and easy to understand approach, keeping chapters short and to the point. I found many chapters full of real world advice including ""Helping Teams Grow and Develop"" and ""The Art of Facilitation"".This is a good book for executives to give to their mid-level managers they can start to discover the leader within them and the possibilities that lie ahead."
4,Slow start,"I am an organizational development consultant in the Air Force. This review is a response to the author in an email.At first I thought the book was too elementary then I realized that I had to shift mindsets after plowing through ""The Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology"" by Rodney Lowman which had a very different writing style. I started to enjoy it with Chap 5, The Possibilities"" probably because I made the shift to your style and my personality is creative dreamer and it caught my attention.I liked your use of triangles, then thought you over did it, then saw how it made your ideas hang together and gave a simple visual picture for the reader.Could not think of anything that I didn't find or needed more info on. Amazing you could be so thorough in 112 pages."
5,extreme worship,extreme worship I LOVE THE EXTENSIONS TO THE SONGS & THE LIVE EFFECT IT ADDS TO IT ....
4,GOOD QUALITY LIGHT DUTY,"I've had this hammer for a few years now and I like it quite a bit.Knowing this is a light duty finish tool,I've put it through some serious pounding and pulling.my torture test didn't loosen the head or break the handle.It passed with flying colors.The black finish has worn off over the years but thats no big deal after all it is a hammer.the price is very good. Well worth the money.In my opinion this hammer is tool box worthy. Now get out and pound something."
3,not so powerful,I looked at a lot of similarly priced blenders and thought this was our best option. It works fine but isn't near as powerful as I thought it would be. I mostly make smoothies with some or all frozen fruit and there are usually some chunks. I wouldn't purchase again.
5,Gripping story!,"This is an inspiring, suspenseful story full of rich detail about what life on The Ice was like for these brave men who spent almost 3 years there in the early years of this century, when sails were still used on ships. The beauty, richly described by Cherry; the torturous conditions at times, how they kept busy and sane during the long long dark winter....I was completely enthralled even though I knew at least the rough outlines of the story before I began. I highly recommend it."
5,Uninmaginable,"Could not put my Kindle down. I probably found the book in ""true accounts"". I enjoyed the writing but the story is so captivating because it is true.Andy Itzov"
3,important note about the product,"If it comes to the Cossacks Anthology I ordered via Amzon.com I have to say that I did not receive exactly this what was in the product's description on the web-page. I did not get exactly this edition of the game, that was mentioned in the product's description. I wanted to buy an original version of Cossacks Anthology, the one in black box, which should contain 3 original CD's with subsequent game versions. Instead I got everything on one DVD with additional Cossacks2 game + AddOn. There are CD-keys for Cossacks Back to War and two Cossacks2 games. I But product works fine after the installation. Cossacks Back to War works even on Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 + wine 1.3). So I got two more things and finally I like it."
5,"A must have, handy little tool!","After the April Tornado, we ordered the wonderbar pry bar. It has been wonderful and we use it nearly everyday. It is small and light enough to carry around everywhere. It has been great for pulling nails out of boards (decking, fences, and barn boards). We have always used hammers for pulling nails but decided to try the wonderbar and we have been very pleased. This has become our favorite handy little tool."
4,Solid Toolbox Bar,"A solidly made prybar. It is nice that it is small enough to fit in a toolbox but the larger 16"" or 18"" models offer more leverage."
2,"Boring, dry, and inaccurate","I own most of the Rookie Read-About Holidays series and have used the books both in the ESOL classroom and with my own children. Out of the entire series, this is my least favorite book. It's a dry, boring introduction to Presidents Day and offers only the most superficial of information about Washington and Lincoln. No other Presidents, including the current one, are mentioned, nor is the President's role well defined. The book focuses as much on the Revolutionary and Civil Wars as on Presidents Day and portrays the Civil War as a war fought exclusively over slavery. It also implies that all southerners were pro-slavery and were slave owners. Had I read this book before ordering, I would not have ordered it, and I will not be using it for anything other than pictures."
2,"I know I'm going to get flak for this, but...","Tiamat is like a parody of everything postmodern Germanic, with their Eurotrash techno beats and faux-gothic vocals. They remind me of that Saturday Night Live skit where Mike Myers plays a nouveaux-German she-male who listens to rave and asks people to pet his monkey.I honestly don't know why some metalheads still go in for this stuff, except for some misguided sense of loyalty that seems to inflict us as a class. It is the same sense that makes some metal fans buy The Gathering's ""How to Measure a Planet?"" or anything recent from Pyogenesis. Don't get me wrong, I like experimentation within metal (heck, I even like the new Anathema album), but note the operative word, ""within."""
2,"Dammit, it happened again...","...I hate it when bands do this. This album is just plain weak. It's weak, AND it sounds just like Pink Floyd. Get ""Wildhoney"", it's way better. This is a pretty good album when you're stoned though..."
2,Far from Almodovar's best!,"I really don't know how so many people love this film. I just watched it and it is by far Almodovar's worst film.My biggest problem with the film is that he does not build the characters AT ALL! Why did Helena do what she did? Was she guilty or bored? I gues I can make my own back story to fill in the HUGE gaps in the film but in this one he is asking a lot.Does not stand up to Talk to Her, High Heels, Women on the Verge..., or any of his other great films."
2,Wrong aspect ratio listed,"It is a very narrow 2.35:1. NOT the 1.66:1 listed on the site. The vhs version has the theatrical bars durring the credits, and it is 1.85:1, so I don't know why they made that a horrible 2.35. That even puts black bars on it using a wide screen tv. Major dissapointment for my favorite elvis movie. mes."
1,One of Presley's Weakest,"A failed attempt to break away from the usual Elvis Presley formula. ""Live a Little, Love a Little"" (1968) has few redeeming features: the classic song ""A Little Less Conversation,"" a terrific Elvis fight sequence, and the presence of Rudy Vallee. Otherwise, it's a badly scripted romantic comedy. Veteran director Norman Taurog ends his career on a less-than-stellar note."
1,Came broken,This item did not work when I took it out of the box. It is not returnable to Amazon so I tried California Exotics and was advised they will not return Amazon sold items and that the items from Amazon are not legit. =( I bent over and got screwed.
5,GOOD STUFF,Bought it for my wife to use while I'm in Afghanistan. Its her first vibrator and she loves it. It does the job every time.
1,Just bad,"I bought this program with some knowledge of how to play the guitar and reading music but this program is terrible. The lessons are very short and I think the lessons start out at a intermediate level, even though they're considered basic in the eyes of Magix; assuming you can already read music and apply it to the guitar strings in a matter of a short time; doesn't work that way. Pick another product and skip this one. I usually enjoy Magix' programs but this one is just bad."
5,Best Assembly Hammer for Woodworking and etc.,"I've had one of these for several years and they are indispensable when assembling tight joints. I use a pounding block in most cases, but if your not pounding too hard and it is hardwood, you won't leave any marks. I have used it on metal projects too, but I always use a wood block to protect the plastic hammer.There is loose shot in oil in the head which hits the hammer just after the hammer hits the work, offsetting the reaction. The dead blow action keeps the hammer from bouncing, which makes it alot easier on your wrist. You get more movement from a lighter blow with this hammer, as the hammer tends to follow the workpiece's direction of travel. A great tool, but I hear you can't buy one in California. (Hammer Control?)"
4,naked space,I ordered the movie almost two weeks before Christmas as a gift and it was received on time. Thank you very much.
1,EMPTY SPACE,"Filmed on a budget of probably no more than $1200, NAKED SPACE is one of the WORST Spoofs I've ever seen. Writer/director/co-star Bruce Kimmel bombards us with lame, humorless dialogue; a set that looks like Plan 9 from Outer Space with a budget cut, and the performances (save for Gerrit Graham's mugging) are unabashedly terrible. Never would I have thought Leslie Nielsen could be so unfunny, nor Cindy Williams and Patrick Macnee so obnoxious. As for Kimmel, what is it with the song and dance numbers? I Want to Eat Your Face was funny for about two seconds. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I did expect a laugh or two. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
3,"Awful, but worth it for one scene","This movie is one of the most god-awful satires I've ever seen, but fans of unintentional self-parody may enjoy Bruce Kimmel's antics. That said, the scene in which the monster sings ""I want to eat your face"" has got to be the funniest scene in any movie ever made."
5,Sensitive and OFTEN humourous book,"""Liza's Blue Moon"" is a one-of-a-kind story of a girl who just doesn't fit in. Ignored and differnet she tries to be herself. Liza is worried that her family, "" is no family at all, just strangers living together."" ""Liza's Blue Moon"" is recommened for teens to young adults and even parents who might want to know whats going on in their children's minds. It's for the people who are lonely, the people who aren't, and everybody in between. A sensitive and often humorous book for anyone who can laugh, cry, and want to just be themselves."
5,"Confession, Healing and Moving on","I enjoyed reading this book because it dealt with truth. So often in the church we shy away from admitting feelings of attraction, anger, thoughts of someone being potentially ""the one."" In doing so we hide a lot of things we are too embarrassed to discuss. I also like this book because it dealt with failure and forgiving yourself in order to move on. The beauty is that along with the help of the Holy Spirit, some people helped the brain surgeon to confess his past and move on on without his knowledge of their indirect help or the fact that God used them for that very purpose."
3,"Good, but need more practice.","This is good cd and showing their potencial, although not satisfying. Big problem is that the female lead singer's voice is pretty, but too weak.(sometimes sounds like Britiney Spere) If you have tried ""Nighttime birds"" by The Gathering, you would know what Theatre of Tragedy lacks of. I am not sure if she needs more practice or they need better vocalist."
3,"Great summary, but no detail.","This book offers a good summary of the legal process, but offers little or no detail, eg. the strategies of settlement. Focusing on Federal law, it has no state-specific information (although it does indicate where you can find it in some cases). If you're looking for an overview of the process, this is the book for you. But if you have any experience whatsoever, or you're looking to get information on settlement strategy, you're better off using a law library's practice guides and legal treatises."
4,A good purchase,I bought this device to replace the humidifier that I had which failed. I did not wish to deal with a pad-type humidifier which can breed bacteria and make a mess. This humidifier sprays a fine mist of water into the air duct when the furnace is running. Humidity level is adjustable by turning a screw.
1,A big scam!,"My title says it all: this reprint is a piece of garbage and a total waste of money. The original publication dating back from 1915, I did not expect a perfect reprint, but this is an insult to buyers! The reprint is a collection of trashy, hardly legible photocopies. The plates are even worse as the photocopy process has bleached out the major part of the drawings and blotched whatever was left. The captions are illegible as well. The original information and illustrations being important to collectors and teachers, it would be of great importance to take utmost care in their reproduction. With today's technology, I cannot believe that the so-called publisher (Forgotten Books) could not have done a better job. I did not return the book because it's not worth my time or mailing money, but buyers remember: Forget about Forgotten Books!"
2,falls short of expectations,"I had such high hopes for this piano music, given how beautiful the songs are, but these melodies are abbreviated, and the arrangements lack creativity."
2,?,"I expected better of this album.But,besides ""Detox"" and ""Oh My F**king God"",This album is kind of boring."
4,WoW!!,"This is what would happen if Fear Factory and Pantera had a baby, and raised it on Slayer. These guys are AWESOME!!!! This is filled with seething rage, and I love it. Can't wait to see them live. Their shows have got to at least rival that of all of the above. It's sharp, viceral, and in need of a pit when listening to it."
2,"Top music, below-standard vocals....","This CD by ICED EARTH it's a complete mixture from every top band metal produced: Maiden, Priest, Metallica, Slayer.. you can check the influences clearly.But the trouble with ICED EARTH (and I know Jon Schaffer is gonna tell to me f...myself)is the vocal lines of the songs. Htere are simply none!! Matthew Barlow has a good voice, but the melody lines totally lack imagination, they're all the same in every track!! IT's an amazing flaw for suck a highly skilled band!!"
4,"Good. Not great, but good","LIKED:-price-clasp-material-foamDISLIKED:-size-shapeThis is a good neck pillow. It uses ""memory foam"" which just means that the foam is firm and not the stuff they put in those ""egg crate"" sleeping rolls. Everything is good about this pillow, except, I wasn't crazy with the size of it, or the shape. The back of the pillow is a little too small/recessed for me. I like a larger support in the back for those long car trips. As for the shape, the ""wings"" of the pillow are larger and taper out, instead of in. I would have preferred it the other way around. For the price though, overall, not bad at all."
3,Too big in center back of neck,"The pillow is nicely constructed of quality materials, but the design puts too much foam in the crook of the neck and pushes the head too far forward and out of the comfort zone. I took a sharp serrated knife and trimmed off some of the foam. Worked fine after surgery."
4,"Good quality, bad color","The quality is fine, however, if the producer can make it in dark colors such as black, dark grey and deep blue, this product will be better."
1,Warning! The paperback is NOT the Jeremy Taylor Classic,"The Marvin Hinten book has Jeremy Taylor's name and title on the cover, but the text itself is not a rendering of Taylor's work, butrather a contemporary Christian's inspiration and interpretation of it. I bought it thinking it was Taylor himself, and I was disappointed -- even more so when I got my hands on the real thing and read its beautiful 16th century language and classic, literate Anglicanism. The Hinten book is closer to a modern American work of contemporary Christian spiritual advice. I believe this book is misclassified as a paperback version of Taylor's work."
3,The Double,"Found this movie moderately entertaining. Hard to justify gross killings to a revenge motive. Watched it all the way thru, but wouldn't recommend it very highly."
5,suprise,"Very good movie didn't see the ending coming, action and good story line, suprised it didn't have a lot of bad language."
3,Show-spolier trailer?,"I was looking forward to seeing this, but after seeing the trailer, I felt like the show was given away."
4,movie review,"This is not one of Richard Gere's greatest performances; however, the storyline was interesting and it served as good entertainment."
3,Tried too hard,"It's movies like this that show how important writers are. There were some good ideas here and maybe they would have worked with different pacing and more suspense/mystery. Instead it's clear early on what most of the plot is and then given away with the first ""twist"" that comes far too early in the movie. The final ""twist"" is a writer's trick that is never given proper setup. Gere and Grace did their thing but as we've seen time and again actors can't save a mediocre script. Three stars is being generous."
2,boring,"Love Richard Gere, but it is hard to take this movie seriously when Topher Grace is the co-star (well known for his role in the comedy ""The 70's Show""). I agree with one of the other reviewer about the first scene when the woman at the ball park found R. Gere cute, instead she should have thought of him as a pedophile. Also, soon in the movie, they reveal who Cassius is and takes away any suspense or desire to continue watching that boring movie. At the end, there was a small attempt to add a twist to this never ending movie...but still...no substance."
3,concrete board,You will avoid the dust by using this product. It does not cut as well as I had hoped. It crushes the edges not leaving a nice clean perfect edge. If you need perfection buy something else but if you don't then elect to protect your health by not breathing the dust that saw-cutting concrete board produces. Maybe the steelhead was defective.
1,Poor Quality,Waited a long time for these zip tie mounts but the wait was not worth it. I could not get the release backing off the adhesive foam for attachment. Either old adhesive or poor quality - probably a bit of both. I can't recommend this product and have made arrangement to return for refund.
4,"So far, so good!","i did not realize they would be so tiny! i have used 7 of these to rewire my computer, and they have really good grip at the moment. only najor gripe is that the backing that covers the sticky side is really tough to remove. after trying fingernails and xacto blades, i resorted to using tweezers. took a small chunk off each corner when removing the backing tape, too, and i could not really avoid it, due to the mounts' smaller size.overall a good product for me, and i hope they stick for a long time!"
2,What's all the fuss?,"Really, I don't understand what all the raves were about. To me, this book was striving for greatness but fell fall short. The writing was convoluted and the story, which tried to be some sort of secret, was obvious."
2,Over-rated,The prose is turgid and laboured. A real slog and not the shining prose people talk about. The PR for this writer is better then the prose. Sorry
5,An Amazing Read,"For the first time in a long time, as soon as I finished reading Colum McCann's THIS SIDE OF BRIGHTNESS, I started the book all over again. It's the best of both worlds, contemporary and historical fiction in one. And when the two stories collide, it's magical. I have already recommended this book to countless friends and will continue to do so. My copy of LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN, McCann's newest novel, just arrived, and I can't wait to dive in."
2,First impression,"At first, I thought it was a very hip-hoppy, catchy sort of tune, but after a while, it got boring. It's too bubble-gum pop kind of music for me to appreciate, so if you don't like bubble-gum pop, DON'T GET IT!"
4,1 1/2 thumbs up. HAHAHA,"the bonus track is a wonderful song sang by marie serneholt and sara lumholdt called ""don't even know your name"".i think this cd has a lot of variety but corny cheesy beats that you just can't help but sing and dance to. i loves it."
5,INFECTIOUS!!,love it !! can't say enough good things about this group and this album. whenever your feeling low on energy--just pop the a-teens into your cd player and you'll soon feel totally revitalized!! i'm not a teenager anymore but you don't have to be to enjoy their music. they have a great beat going and they certainly get me going in the mornings when i'm driving to work. their voices are purely melodic!!!try it and i know you'll LOVE IT.
1,Pathetic,"I bought this book expecting the same suspense as the author's ""Martin Vail"" books. This book was pathetic in comparison! Not only, do I not wish to read about the ""Old West"",the jumping from time period to time period made it so that I did not care about what happened to any of the characters.The vivid descriptions of the ""Old West"" were totally boring and I skipped over them whenever possible. This book was a waste of time and money."
2,Plot by number,"All the familiar conventions are here. You know the kicker well before it is revealed. Nothing really new, and yet it still hooks you. Mindless beach read."
2,2 year life,"We bought this beautiful machine after many other ""cheaper ones"". But within 6 months, the wand started leaking (have to leave a towel to soak up the excess water when not steaming). The temp. gauge never read the correct temp. so I emailed CS and was informed that the gauge is for asthetic use only---and not accurate. (It's for novelty use only). A few weeks later, the temp. gauge stopped working completely. 2 years later; the seams are rusting....and when you release the steam valve now, there is no steam pushed out (no pressure to heat the milk).... We clean and maintain it 2x a month....but do make ALOT of espresso (3-4 day).CS says to mail it to them to repair for a cost. I am REALLY disappointed it didn't last even 2 years!"
3,Great for first week ...,"Well, I originally gave this machine 5 stars -- wonderful coffee for the first week, then ""BOOM"" the thermostat seems to have crapped out already. The brew temperature is now way too hot, burns the espresso. Yuck!To Francis' credit, they are sending me a repair authorization, with a box to ship it back to them for repair, no cost to me.So, I'll wait to amend this again after I see how the repair goes, and how long it lasts before anything goes wrong again.It made terrific coffee at first! *sniff* Now I'm gonna be drinking tea for a while. Rats!"
2,Good Coffee - Poor reliability,"I bought one of these machines in 11/99; had to replace it in March and then just shipped back the replacement. It looked terrific in my kitchen, and made great coffee when it worked. But, the machine just isn't well made."
3,i lost my mojo,stuck mojo wow don't even remind me of this band with bulldog singer wee ooh wee possible back injury.
4,"Not Quite 5 Stars, But Very, Very Good!","Firstly, I know that this CD has been around for a decade, but I just replaced it - I've always been surprised that Jamie didn't become a bigger star on the strength of this album, because she is definitely very talented, a beauty along the lines of Faith Hill and her songs are (unlike Faith's, god love her) definitely heavy on the country. I especially love, all these years later, the hit ""There Is No Arizona""; Jamie's throaty voice has that almost Tammy Wynette level of weariness to it when she sings the lyrics. I also like ""She Hasn't Heard It Yet"" and ""The Only Thing Wrong""; ironically, the song I least care for is the title song. It's because of a couple of weak songs that I'm being a grinch and just giving this four stars, but it is definitely worth the money, and a listen, and afterward looking up more of Jamie's work. Somebody get this lady back on the radio!"
3,No expert advice.,"There are a lot better products in the market, done with true expertise and no speculation. This video does entertain but leaves a lot to desire. It may serve as an aid for a beginer with large birds."
4,good primer,I have learned a lot from this dvd. I found the inclusion of tabs to go along with the lessons extremely helpful.
1,Don't believe the hype!,"I feel ripped off for wasting my 9.95 on this cd. Remembering Never are so caught up in having to explain what every song means that they cant even write a decent song. Every song sounds exactly the same, I could hardly tell when a song ended and a new one began. I like heavy music like LoG, Shadows Fall, etc. but this sh*t just sucks. This band has close to zero talent, sorry. IMHO I would skip this cd!"
4,"A modern version of ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre""","I'm not sure why this film has brought out such negative reaction, nor why it has been virtualy forgotten among modern classics- great book, wonderful actors and a thoughtful screenplay- my only concern was the name-change from the original title, ""Dog Soldiers"". It has been one of the few films (and novel) that have stood up to repeated viewings- perhaps you have to know the elements that make up the plot (the allure of easy money, smak, and/or the sense of honor, that each character desires) before you can appreciate what is really a timeless tale of longing and need. One of my favorite films."
3,These are toys,"These are cheap....now we're covered the good point. This pry bar is too thick for trim removal jobs and that sort of thing. It bends easily, so its not really a pry bar, except when working on a Barbie house. For good small pry bars, worth many times the difference in price, try the Hyde # 45000 pry bar or the Titan #17005."
5,Snapshots!,This is a great book for educators to use as a guide to conduct minilessons. It has many minilessons that vary from reading to writing. It also discusses how to conduct minilessons and why to use them. It is also an easy read and enables teachers to get a better idea of what a minilesson is.
4,Pretty good stuff,"OK. I checked this CD out for a few hours today..... as a note, to another review, this is NOT Blink or MXPX. The only thing they have in common is that their harmonies and melodies sound REALLY good...this CD is slower rock (in comparison to punk) but it is definitely along the lines of Lit....it's a great CD, and some riffs even reminded me of real old-school Smashing Pumpkins (but cleaner). It's pretty good stuff if you're looking for some new music...some basslines are like Teenage Dirtbag by Wheatus too.."
3,Children of Nirvana,"The sad state of alternative music, and American rock in general, will never stop the children of Nirvana from putting their pale stamp on three or four of their favorite chords. Occasionally, one of the more talented collectives rings a little juice from this old lemon. On their debut, American Hi-Fi aren't that good, but neither are they disgraceful. Singer Stacey Jones, late of Letters to Cleo and Veruca Salt, keeps the songs simple, and drummer Brian Nolan makes sure they motor quickly forward. There's an echo-chamber quality to many of these cuts which often sound like so many other bands you'll be tempted to ask if you haven't heard this before. Of course, you have, but stuff does stand out. ""A Bigger Mood"", ""Safer on the Outside"", ""My Only Enemy"", and ""Don't Wait for the Sun"", though familiar, are pleasant company - not too tiresome and not too taxing."
1,Save your money......,"i got this cd as a gift for my birthday about two weeks ago, along with their newer one - both suck. i logged on to amazon to read the reviews and it is obvious that the only people writing the reviews are fans. they sound like a bunch of rip-off artists - i recognized lyrics from many other bigger bands. where are they now? i'll tell ya where - playing concerts for like 10 bucks a pop. they made it big ---not!!!!!!"
2,Beginners stuff,"I am quite familiar to object oriented analysis and design , design patterns, and would like to learn UML, that's the objective I bought this book. I found that this book was very poor to meet my objective. I don't learn UML idioms, something that I really like to. What I really learn from this book is how to draw some UML diagrams.I think this book assumes that you have minimal or no object oriented analysis, design, and programming. Maybe it is helpful for you if you would like to start to learn OO design. If you would like to apply the UML and design pattern, try Craig Larman Applying UML and Patterns book."
1,Not a Garrett PI series #2,I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Passage of Arms because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.
2,Not that great,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the negative reviews here ... unless you're a Captain Britain fan, not even psylocke and rachel summers can save this graphic novel from itself. Mediocre at best and not necessary for enjoyment of the entire House of M experience ..."
2,Necessary?,"The X-Men are the group most affected by the events of House of M, further proof of which you can find in Decimation and The 198. They play a big part in House of M, so an Uncanny X-Men tie-in seemed redundant. I can agree that if you're an Excalibur fan you may want to pick this up, but I didn't find that it helped with the House of M storyline."
2,Happy then ... bang,"Up until yesterday, I was quite happy with this machine gifted to me just about a year ago. Yesterday it literally blew up, losing its clock (which skidded halfway across the kitchen), one of the indicator bulbs (which I still can't find) and most dramatically the entire steel top was displaced upward only holding in place due to the bolts and screws. I had stepped out to my deck for 30 seconds when this happened and only appreciated later it was good I wasn't in the kitchen. So now it sits unusable and I'm hoping for the best with Francis' Customer Service though I'm disheartened to read one reviewer's comments. As it was a gift, it will be interesting to see how the company responds. By the way, the only potential warning sign was an increased noisiness as the machine heated up to steam milk."
3,Its ok,This album sounds like Iced Earth playing more progressive but with good solos. Its just ok because there are no very good memorable chorus or melodies. Its a metal band -> that's it. But its much better than dead heart in a dead world
2,a true disappointment,"This book is weak. Chloe does Yale is an offensive reference to a famous porn movie, ""Debbie Does Dallas"" and this book is a disgrace to Yale. The book lacks any real insight into sex or into the lives of people at Yale."
1,Hello boring!,"Jeez, how hard can it be to make a book about sex entertaining? Especially when it's in the ivy league? Or maybe Ivy sex is actually just boring, I dunno. This book makes it seem like that. The first couple pages were kind of entertaining--the whole first chapter was decent I guess--but then it got so, so dull! Chloe is a dumb character, and she doesn't do anything interesting.Definitely not as good as expected."
3,Good book,I found this book inspiring and a good resource for a newbie.What surprised me was the lack of photos otherwise would give it a 4 star. Even without the photos there should be a blurb about each recipe on possible appearance/texture could/would be. Otherwise a good book.
3,Natural Beauty For Fun,"I find this book good fun for a teen girl's slumber party, but never use any of this stuff on a daily basis. I just never have everything I need for the recipes & find it easier to grab Burt's than get together all the ingredients for natural face wash. I like the book, I just rarely use it."
3,Cats Paw claw/puller,"Stanley is usually pretty good tools but this one i had to grind the claw area thinner so it would dig into the wood to remove nails. It came with the claw end to thick, need to beat the heck out of it to get under a nail. Good tool just bad mfg.Works great now"
1,Super cute for the first few cycles,"Seriously, this monkey is precious! When I first saw him I thought ""I want one for my daughter!"" After hearing the monkey go through two cycles I wanted to shoot it! It is annoying!!!!! Cute in theory but in practice not practical. Don't push your child to potty train- let them do it when they are ready!! You will avoid regressions and other issues in the future. If you buy this monkey you may run over it in your driveway!"
3,Potty Training monkey,I thought it was a great idea. We were desperate in ideas to potty train our son. He liked it at first but wanted nothing to do with it after the first day.We will try to use it again later. Cute kid friendly voice. Kind of expensive.
1,horrible - timer does not work,The monkey did not work for us. The timer does not work. And now the monkey announces he needs to go whenever ... it is like having another kid - trying to find his little potty so he won't keep announcing he has to go. I would not recommend this product.
3,It's a decent TOY.....,"I ordered this product for my son in hopes of expediting the potty training process. The toy itself seems sturdy although the battery pack (which has to be accessed to set the time or turn off the monkey) doesn't fit easility into the pocket on the back of the monkey. The book for the kids is cute and simple. I wouldn't put too much worth into the book for the adults as it advises to give your child laxitives to cause more frequent bowel movements as a ""super pooper = a super pee-er"". I would recommend this product in general as long as you are prepared for the short novelty effect it will most likely have with your child. Also, prepare yourself for the flushing of the toy potty, it is super loud. All in all it's a toy and does everything the description says."
5,skin saver,"We put these on our cat who only has back claws and is inside all of the time. He is a pretty rambunction kitty, so he still scratched things like our leather furnature and our skin when he would run around and jump off of things.He tolerates them pretty well. He does try to pull them off, especially right after we re-apply, so we try to distract him with treats and toys for the first 10-15 minutes after we put them on him until the glue dries.He was always a nail sharpener anyways, so it's hard to tell if his occasional chewing at them is annoyance at the soft paws, or his natural instinct to sharpen his claws.Even still, they stay on for several weeks before he gets them off. And now I don't have to worry about scratches on the furnature or myself.Unless you have a comotose kitty, I think it is a necessity to have two people put them on. One to hold the cat, and other to squirt the glue into the nail cover and then apply it."
5,I like Porter-Cable,"I bought this router for exclusive use with the Kreg Professional Router Table. I needed a variable speed router for larger bits.I carefully read all directions - always a GOOD idea. Mounted the router and am VERY happy I purchased this router. I also have a generic plunge router but wanted a variable speed rounter I could use for the table.It works like a charm! I especially like the safety features. If the power switch is on you can not lock the spindle to remove the bit. That may see dumb, but with the router connected to a remote on/off switch on the table, it's always a good idea to make sure the power switch is off on the remote switch AND the router AND unplugged! Safety first.I've been using this router for a few weeks now. No issues.I would recommend this router."
3,Not as good as the first...,"I really loved her first album - the songs were varied and interesing and of course, Jessica's awesome voice. I bought this one the day it came out and I am disappointed. Who I am is the only song I really, really like. The rest just sort of blend together. In fact, if it wasn't for Jessica's incredible voice, I would probably rate the CD even lower :("
5,Sophomore,"Jessica Andrews' new album WHO I AM is a wonderful surprise. After the success of HEART SHAPED WORLD, it was time for a new album. This album shows Jessica's strength and independance, and willingness to find her own identity in the world of country music. The lead single and title track is a declaration of who Jessica is, where she's come from and where she is going. The second single, the lush ballad powered by that beautiful voice, ""Hopelessly, Helplessly"" is a surefire hit, showing her vocal ability and strength, as on ""Every Time"" and ""Now I Know"". The album is irresistible on songs like ""I Don't Like Anyone"", ""Karma"", ""Never Had It So Good"", ""These Wings"" etc, in fact not one filler track is to be found here. This is a nice album, so check it out and you'll be surprised by this girls talent, listen as we watch as her star rises."
3,"Lovely voice, but forgettable album","It's a shame that Jessica Andrews got such poor material for her first CD. Her voice has tremendous range and talent, and she's a delightful young lady, but none of the tracks on this CD have staying power. ""Who I Am - Rosemary's Granddaughter"" is charming but easily forgettable and won't last as a long-term hit. I hope to see this promising talent stay on the scene, but she'll have to find better songwriters and promotors."
3,Not As Good As Last One... But,"I like this cd is very good. It is not as good as her first one ""Heart Shaped World"" though. If you like that one you will like this one though. She sounds more mature and this album shows her range more than her last one did."
4,Best cuts,"I bought the original release of this collection and I really enjoyed it. The only thing that is redeeming about it is that it's AAD meaning Analog/Analog/Digital. The recordings may have tape hiss in it and the volume isn't as loud as the newly remastered version. Though I have heard that some of the tracks such as ""Love Hangover"" claim that it's the original 12 inch(album) version but really it isn't. Out of all her single disc collections, this one is the ideal choice. Best cuts: Upside Down, I'm Coming Out, The Boss, Love Hangover, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, It's My Turn, and Remember Me."
2,Beware of the misleading label,The previous reviewer beat me to it but it bears repeating... this version does NOT contain the extended versions of Love Hangover and Ain't No Mountain High Enough. Don't be fooled by the CD label. A big disappointment.
3,Missing Medley,"I kind of wonder why All The Great Hits was reissued without the Supremes' Medley found on side four of the original 1981 vinyl version.The medley which I enjoyed very much includes:You Keep Me Hanging OnMy World Is Empty Without YouYou Can't Hurry LoveLove ChildReflectionsI Hear A SymphonyLove Is Here And Now You're GoneSomeday We'll Be TogetherWithout the medley, this version of All The Great Hits is pretty redundant as all tracks can be found in her other compilations/albums."
1,Single with just two album tracks,"This is actually NOT the album (even Amazon says ""rate this album"") it's just the single that has the same title as the album.It contains the song ""Scare Yourself"" and ""Last Chance To Change""; both available on the album.I have heard better D:A:D songs though. And a single with only two songs not having a non-album-track is not worth buying. So it only gets one star. Keep your hands off!"
4,"Fun ""B"" Spy Movie","If you're a fan of early/mid-1960s B-movies and TV shows, you'll get a kick out of this little black and white espionage picture. It's somewhat more reminiscent of an early episode of The Man From UNCLE or Amos Burke, Secret Agent than James Bond. It is particularly recommended for fans of two of the lovliest exotic starlets or the era -- Aliza Gur and Edina Ronay."
2,whoa,"It's a good product, my only beef is the size. It is a lot fatter than what the picture leads you to belive"
5,awesome!,Gotta love stephen king!!kathy bates rules this movie! shes one tough cookie that dont take no crap!!
5,Kathy Bates was robbed.,This was probably the biggest Oscar slight of the 1990's. Bate's performance was truly spectacular as a woman who was treated so unfairly in life and by a community. You couldn't help but feel that you knew someone like her and wondered what you could do to help her. Buy the DVD if you buy it at all.
4,Beware if you reside in USA ..,"I got a copy for about 22 bucks it clearly stated ""region free"" on cover .. BUT it did NOT play on any of my DVD players (standard) in my House ..It played on my computer , which suggests it is NOT region free .. great stuff tho; raw and live UK style Ska ..i'm a big Fan of the 'Godfather of Ska' The Late Great ..Laurel Aitken. I wish I could play this on my big stereo system .. buyer be aware ."
5,Exodus- Another Lesson in Violence,"By far my favorite live album of any band. Definitely a keeper for times with friends, beer and some good old thrash. And it aint about no trout!"
5,Amazing Live CD,"Unbelievable. Even though all the songs are over 10 years old, they sound fresh and heavy as ever. The sound quality of this live recording is amazing. The guitars and drums sound great. If you have not heard any Exodus, this is THE Cd to get. If you're a fan, you must add this one to your collection. Mosh!"
5,Great Resource,"I think every library should carry this book as an all 'round resource book about Bellydance. One look at the table of contents and you will understand why. This book seems to touch on just about everything. (I can't really think of anything it doesn't cover.) Any beginner should get this book, it gives you a great overview. (Good for all levels of dancers.)"
2,"IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE, AND BETTER","The first two of the Family Guy Star Wars parodies were quite funny. This one is just a retread of the jokes already covered in the other two, plus even more uninspired jokes on top of these. the writers, et al, even state in the crawl at the beginning of the feature that they were out of ideas. They were right. a waste of time that could have been better used watching the mold grow on the coffee grounds in the trash can."
5,Great movie,"While not as good as the first two It's a Trap is still a great movie, and well worth the money."
4,Why all the hatin'?,"Its a good Family Guy movie..Chill..A little more profane than the others, and even they acknowledge that maybe the shine has gone from the parodies, but no matter who ultimately wrote it, its funny, corny and irreverant, or everything Family Guy should be and is.."
1,"Why? Seth, Why?","This was terrible. I struggled to find anything at all humorous with this latest edition, which is hard to admit considering how much I liked the previous two. The beginning intro was not lying at the terrible quality of this release. I thought it was a joke, but watching it clearly shows it was completely serious.We get, its crap, but by saying its crap, doesn't excuse it being crap. And the only thing that you should have added to this intro of scrolling text was, ""If you bought this DVD, you got screwed...""Do NOT waste your money on this. You have been warned."
2,Meh - so-so,"Meh - so-so as far as family guy material goes. I'd really like to rate this 2.5 stars - i wont go so far as to say 'i dont like it (2 stars)' but i'm not sure i'd say 'its ok (3 stars)' either. For me, it kinda dragged on. I've had louder and longer laughs watching family guy episodes on tv then i had with this. At best, this one got a couple of weak chuckles out of me. Sadly, i don't think it's worth $20. Wait for it on netflix or tv.Sorry seth - but i just had to come back and change it to 2 stars. I was about to submit it with 3 stars because in general i like your stuff, but this one really was just kinda lame for me."
2,Just plain dissapointing.,"The fact that in the first 3 minutes, the creator himself tells the audience that his creation was clearly rushed and says ""Lower your expectations, okay?"" was a truly disappointing sight. The movie itself had plenty of gaps, and was obviously not done well at all.I give the writers credit for their effort, but besides that, it was just... awful.Seth Macfarlane, you have saddened your fans. In my eyes, you have just made ""It's a Trap"" for your own profit, as you stated: ""Fox wouldn't let me direct my movie if I didn't do Jedi"". Great job Seth, great job."
3,not too bad,"This third installment in the Family Guy/ Star Wars series was a definite improvement over the second ""Someting..Darkside"", but still didn't reach the level of the original ""Blue Harvest"". The scrolling narrative at the beginning jokes about the interns and /or janitor being responsible for this episode and it seemed at times it may not have been a joke. The jokes were not quite as witty as the first instalment."
3,"Good, not Great","The third installment of ""Family Guy""'s take on the first(second?) Star Wars trilogy is pretty funny, but you can tell they were happy to be done with it. Some of the jokes fell flat or were just plain ""huh?"", but as a huge fan, I had to have it."
2,Just not that good.,"First two kicked ass. This one sorta blows. They call it out right in the head SW title crawl. ""Lower your expectations""Bummer."
1,Pen did not work,"The pen looked great and did light up, unfortunately it did not write--The postage for one pen was $9.86. The company offered a refund with the return of the item in the original package(which I had discarded)but since I had alread paid postage nearly as much as the pen, I opted not to spend more money returning it."
2,Coding mistakes and more,"It's heavy on VB.Net, which I didn't expect, based on the title and the year released. What bothers me most is the mistakes in their code. For example, they have you define tables in an Access database, and then, in code, they use different table names. That's just the beginning. The structure of the written code is bizarre; indents are random and meaningless. They don't use good programming practices, either, such as using a with/end with struture instead of typing the same variable name over and over...I don't believe the source code for the book ever was published by ""Premier Press"" (don't be fooled by a name)."
2,Could Have Been Better,"This book covers one of the more fascinating events of the 19th century--the rise of the Sudanese Mahdist Empire--solely in the terms of the series of Anglo-Egyptian expeditions to crush it. While one-sided histories aren't always bad, this one just sort of falls flat. There are better sources on the Mahdists and I'd recommend looking over this one unless you are solely interested in the military aspects [the British ones]. The maps were also of little use as they were zoomed out so much that the book's locales are hardly distinguishable--despite them being divided by great distances!"
4,"Beautiful book, but sadly no longer up-to-date","I purchased this book on the premise that since it had a publication date of 2008, it would have fairly new pictures from the later space probe missions such as Cassini-Huygens and MESSENGER. Unfortunately upon opening the book and skimming through it and checking the copyright date, it does not have any photos later than 2003 in it. I am very disappointed that the publisher would choose to republish a 5 year-old astronomy book without revising it with newer material first. Nevertheless, this book contains a ton of pictures from all the planets in the Solar System taken by Voyager, Galileo, Mariner, Viking, the various circa 2003 Mars probes, Magellan, and an in-transit Cassini probe at Jupiter. If you're looking for the latest pictures circa 2008-2009, you'll be very disappointed by this book. If you just want beautiful pictures of the planets this book has it in spades."
3,Review for Krups Blender,"My 10 year old daughter likes smoothies and I wanted her to eat more fruits. In addition she got tired of eating regular breakfast and wanted something fast. So I bought this blender.No problems so far but here are the things I don't like1. If I put a lot of fruit, bananas, srawberries, ice and etc.it's hard to blend. You have to stop/start etc and doesn't crash the ice well2. It's hard to clean and I am not sure if I can put in the dishwashing machine.3. I would prefer something that if some of the liquid left you can just leave in the container, like Phillips (more expensive) or you can just take the container with you.However this unit was inexpensive and does the job, so I would recommend it but only give 3 stars due to the issues I found with it. In the future I would consider other things and most likely buy a Phillips because it's more convinient."
5,This is the set to buy,"Not only has the price dropped $0.50 since I bought it, this is a great quality set. The only bad things that ever will happen to these is somebody may ""borrow"" them from you and never return them; as is the case with all good tools.I have big hands and they are long enough to get into a corner while holding and not hitting my hand. They are color coded by size while the slightly-cheaper ""TEKTON 6574 Pro Nail Sets, 4-Piece"" is all red and they are also about 3/4"" longer than them as well. I confirmed this via direct contact with Tekton. The ends ""bite"" well and a good solid hit will set your nails every time. They have a square grip to prevent rolling as well.If you want a quality lifetime+ set, buy this one."
3,Great for occasional sanding,"Bought this sander several years ago. Very happy with it's size and quality, but it just up and died. Probably used it a total of 30 hours over the course of these years. It was well cared for, properly oiled, etc. Maybe I didn't use it enough to keep it functioning properly. Disappointed."
5,I couldn't put it down.....,"I bought this book on a Saturday night, late. I decided to wait until I came home from work on Sunday to start reading it. I came home at four on Sunday and took it out... I couldn't put it down! I started reading at four and I didn't put it down until my parents forced me to for dinner. If I didn't have homework I know I would have finished it that night. I brought the book to school the next two days... and I finished it. I normally hate to read but this book was great. I loved to learn about his life. How almost everyday when he was a kid he'd end up getting hurt, and he just kept doing it. I almost cried when he talked about his grandma and when he finally made the NFL. It's a must read for any JET or Wayne Chrebet fan. If you love reading about underdogs coming out this is a definite read!"
5,Great Player ! Great Story! Great book!!,Vic Carucci captures the true essence of a great american dream come true. How can you not root for Wayne Chrebet. Everyone loves an underdog! If you love football read this book!
3,Good luck getting the right helmet!,"Amazon has dropped the ball on this one. I have tried to order 2 of these helmets 3 times and finally received one about 2 months after the first try and the 2nd one a month later. Don't believe the availability, until you receive the tracking number for the shipping. I actually had the first 2 orders cancelled and refunded with no explaination. I suspect that they are losing money if you choose the free shipping option, so they just delay until you either get tired of waiting or they just cancel the order with a lame reason like shipping delivery problem(it never was shipped). The helmets are decent, but even though the picture of the black chrome is shown, you cannot order it. I tried and then when I clicked on the item from my cart, it reverted to the grey skull helmet. My kid didn't care too much, but I don't recommend this product unless you can wait a few months for it. This supplier to Amazon stinks and griping to Amazon about it does little."
1,What Happened,"When I first ordered this item, your company sent me a right handed putter instead of a left handed one. I sent it back and ordered a second one. The second one came and the shaft of the putter was crooked and didn't line up with the head on the putter. So I sent that one bcak also.Your company reimbursed me for the first putter but not for the second one. I would like my charge card credited back."
3,"Good for casual use, but I wouldn't deploy with it.","I bought this three day Molle pack with the intetntion of using for day to day carrying of personal effects, etc. Lately I have been working as a handyman and the bag works well for carrying light tools, my lunch, an extra hoodie and whatnot. The pockets are spacious although they look small. You can fit alot more in the pack than you think. Water bladder pocket, too. My only real complaints are that the cord hanging from each zipper pulls right off with little resistance, and the interior pockets have pretty much fallen apart (I rarely used them anyway). If you are planning on buying this pack to augment an actual soldiers' kit... well I would say no way. If you want something that is going to last through a deployment or even Field Training, save up some cash and get Maxpedition, Blackhawk, or Voodoo Tactical. This bag is okay, but not tough enough for actual military use."
2,Bag has issues,"I was impressed at first with this bag. It has a good layout and design. Lots of space and pockets to put things. It did however develop a tear along the seam of the main compartment the day I purchased it. I'm not sure how common this issue is but I need a bag to last and be tough, the seams of this bag seem poorly constructed and weak. I returned it for a full refund."
2,Merely a sample of their best....nowhere near definitive,"Most of the songs included are unmistakeable classics. ""Mysterious Ways"" and ""One"" being the best of the lot. On the other hand, several of the additions chosen are downright shocking, such as the a remix of the excruciatingly boring ""Numb"". However, what is really DISGUSTING about this album is that one of the greatest U2 songs of all time is missing!!! How can this CD purport to be a showcase of their finest efforts during that decade if it doesn't include ""Whos Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses""? This makes the whole cd a farce."
4,A little disappointed,"I thought disc 1 is strong, particularly the new version of Gone which is pretty amazing, as well as the new tracks which alone are worth getting the CD for. But i think what lost me were some of the B-sides. I was prepared for all of the experimentation of the late 90's on the second half of the collection, and I really love some of them like Lady With the Spinning Head, Summer Rain, North and South, Your Blue Room. But the ""Gimme Some More Dignity Mix"" of Numb becomes obnoxious after an interesting beginning, as does Lemon and the ""Perfecto Mix"" of Even Better than the Real Thing. I wish they would have chosen some other material instead of these. But...it's U2 and they still rock regardless of all the craziness."
4,A WORTHY ADDITION TO THE U2 ANTHOLOGY,"Few greatest hits CD's make one feel like he/she is listening to new, fresh material. Most are nostalgic, and are only of value to new introductees to a band, or as collector's items for die-hard fans.However, that would not be an apt description of this greatest hits CD. The remixes are outstanding and make one feel like he/she is listening to a brand new CD of all new material. The new remixes of Gone, Discotheque, Dirty Day, Staring at the Sun are so far reaching, that they give a new, fresh look at the songs. In most cases, the new mixes are much better than the original versions.There are a number of notable omissions from the Greatest Hits and B-side CD's: Ultraviolet, The Fly, Wild Horses, Zoo Station, Lemon (original version), Mofo, Walk On, Big Girls are Best, Falling at Your Feet, to name a few. But these omissions should not stop you from buying this CD. It is a special collection in its own right."
2,Best Of??? Could have been so much better.,"Not really a 'best of' when two of the 16 songs are new and a further four are re-mixes which in my opinion are not as good as the original - if it's not broke, don't fix it. ...and with so many great B-sides to choose from why select all the bad re-mixes. The first Best of was great, this one is sub-par."
3,Not their decade??,"If one were to judge based entirely on the contents of this CD, one would have to guess that 1990-2000 was not U2's decade, which is unfortunate. I love U2, they are one of (if not the) greatest rock band in the world. Their live shows are everything a rock extravaganza should be. However, this particular collection just does not seem to capture what makes crazy fans of us all. Since it is U2, it will never be a bad album, and many of the re-mixes are fun. However, this cd mostly made me want to pull out their original cds and listen to them instead."
3,Not As Great As the 80s,"U2 went through a strange stage in the 1990s. From a mainstream rock band, they evolved into an alternative-type group with heavy electronic leanings that produced some pretty good songs, but more often than not, music that was less accessible and more ... artsy. They seem to have made a much-welcome U-turn over the past couple of years, back into the glorious tuneful rock of old, but this compilation is evidence of how they almost lost their way in the last decade. There's some rousing U2 staples here (One, Mysterious Ways, Beautiful Day), but if you really want to get into U2, get their 1980s best-of first. Then approach this ... with extreme care."
3,Disapointment,"What a major disapointment from U2 in there lastest effort of a greatest hits album. With so many of there great songs missing from the line up, such as ""Walk On"", there best single in years, and winner of a grammy! How about ""Please"", from POP? But you have tracks like ""The First Time"" that fails to inspire in the ways of ""Walk On"" and so many others!"
3,Addendum to my previous review...,"Yes, it is still only 3 stars. I am writing again because I forgot to mention an observation on my previous review. If this is ""Best of 1990-2000"" why did they include a couple of new songs? The calendar on my wall shows 2002... at least for a couple more weeks."
1,It took ridiculously long to receive!! Then it was scratched!!,It was almost a full month after I ordered this CD before it arrived!! Nothing should take a month anymore! Then it was scratched!!
3,Irish Stew,"Best Of albums rarely please. In fact they almost always cough up one foul onion. Make that two or three. ""The Hands that Built America"" is dire, a lifeless drip. The old tedium of ""Numb"" gets trotted out twice here, its inclusion utterly bewildering to anyone with a functioning ear [come on Edge, stick with your weapon]. What becomes strikingly obvious during a trip through the band's mixed terrain is the vast superiority of ""Achtung Baby"" to all of U2's later work. That album still has gems, ""Until the End of the World"" bringing all the ingredients to simmering perfection. But then you get some bloated Italian puffing away -- oh the misery. The bland remixes of ""Discotheque"" and ""If God Will Send His Angels"" are even more unforgivable. All that aside, this is U2, a great band getting old, a band that even in its sanctimoniousness and current servility to technology beats all the ernest dead men from John Bull's other island."
4,"Pretty good, the remixes hurt and the 1st could be enough","the album is pretty good, even though the remixing of some well known songs in my opinion doesn't improve anything unless you ar a dj or want to play the music in a club. Also, the first cd is good though the second is more like remixes and soundtrack material and is weaker than the firs cd. Unless you are a deep U2 fan and are willing to get some ok(not the best) content, I would rather go for the 1CD version of the album, but don't get me wrong, there are good songs in the album. Good buys!"
3,Pretty good,Now everyone says its bad but honestly I picked it up at staples for 6 bucks. I haven't used a fountain pen since high school. But the pen is kinda awkward since the barrel hole is uncomfortable and every now and then I have to tap it to get the ink flowing. But other than that I think it's good.
5,lol it's a cable,"lol - what do you expect? I opened my delivery and ... yep it was a cable. Works well, I run at 100 Mbps and this cable did not drop my speed."
3,A Good Product,"Use this product while camping. It didn't hold a charge as long as I'd like, but did allow me to enjoy my Cowon a little longer."
4,A savage trip through Sentenced's past,"As the proud owner of 4 Sentenced's albums, I unfortunatly rate this one as 4th. However, this is still a good album, just not on the same level as Down, Frozen, and Crimson. That is only my opinion, though, because I am not extremely fond of deathy vocals. If you are a big death metal fan and are looking for a taste of Sentenced's earlier work, this is an excellent buy. But if you are looking for a follow up to any of their work with Ville Laihiala (the vocalist on the three aforementioned albums), this is not the album to purchase."
1,Predictable and Wrong,"Aside from the big question ""Who sent the arrow?"", there are other predictable scenes in this book. Not to say that being able to predict was a bad thing. I enjoy discovering I'm right. Other people may not though.Overall, the story was fun, but the author make too many mistakes about Gabrielle's history. The name of Gabrielle's hometown is wrong. Her parents and sister seems to have been forgotten. I had really looked forward to reading her interaction with them. As a Gabrielle fan, this really annoyed me.Also, after the long arrow chase, the story is finished with a solution that Xena should have done in the first place.Also, the back of the book completely leaves out a storyline that was just as important as the Myx Arrow. Unlike the arrow story, this storyline is there from the first chapter to the last. That storyline makes the ""bad guy"" not really a bad guy, but Xena and Gabrielle don't acknowledge it."
5,Some nice new twists on Arthurian Legend,"I've always been a huge fan of Arthurian legend, so I was tickled to pick up Guenevere: Queen of the Summer Country. The first in a trilogy, this books follows Guenevere from her reign as Queen of the Summer Country, through her marriage to Arthur, wars, childbirth, and finally her affair with Lancelot. I expected this book to be another regurgitation of the same old legend, but there were some very interesting twists. I found the characters to be very three dimensional and interesting and came to deeply care for, or despise, all of them. I also enjoyed the fact that the story comes from Guenevere's point of view. I found her to be a strong character, but alas, a little frustrating (as in most Arthurian legend). I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy and anticipate more twists and turns."
2,Not at the top of the Arthurian list,"This book and its sequel are so uninteresting that, although devoted to Arthuriana, I can't bring myself to read the third book in the series. There's no new perspective on the characters or story; it just grinds unpleasantly along. Strangely enough, this is one of four recent and dreary Arthurian series (along with those by Stephen Lawhead, Bernard Cornwell and Jack Whyte). I'd rather spend my time re-reading Mary Stewart's Merlin series, Persia Woolley's Guinevere trilogy, Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" or Rosemary Sutcliff's ""Sword at Sunset."""
1,This router is junk,"I bought this router to use on my cnc router. It has never worked well. It bogs down excessively and gets really hot on any kind of normal cut, sometimes to the point of tripping the breaker it's connected to (15A). This is using 1/2"" diameter new, sharp 2 flute spiral carbide bits in MDF. I eventually settled on cutting at 1/8"" depth of cut at 100ipm in order to not have it trip the breaker. My 11 year old Dewalt 1.5HP router will cut vastly better (more like 1/2"" depth of cut at the same speed) using the exact same bit in the same material (even though the PC is supposed to be more powerful). I took the Porter Cable in for service and they said there was nothing wrong. Once I cut a mount for my new spindle, the porter cable is getting relegated to the scrap pile."
1,Porter Cable Junk from China,"Gone are the days when Porter Cable made quality power tools. This router is made in China and it is not up to the quality that Porter Cable used to make. I have four other older Porter Cable routers, and I will never get rid of them as long as they continue to operate. This model 892 router has so much run out on the spindle that it vibrates my router table. Don't waste your hard earned dollars on this piece of junk. You would be better off buying a used older model 690 or 691. I used this router for one day, and will end up selling it for a fraction of the cost on ebay."
1,Blade's Home Movies,Ron Hall is obviously very well trained in the martial arts field but this film's low budget effects and poorly written dialogue takes my attention away from this action/horror genere film. This film was very poorly edidited and one of characters in this film made me want to cheer when his fate came about. I have seen worse effects in a film but obviously this is a very poor try to make this look like an A grade feature film. A dollar maybe too much for this film unless you are planning just to watch and poke fun of this film.
1,Words Can't Express How Terrible!!,This was actually the worst movie on the planet. The costumes were whack and the special effects...lets not even go there...How did this movie even make it out of the thought process...Terrible movie please dont waste your money or free rental on this piece of junk...
4,His hits are here.,"Buyers of this CD expect to find his hits they remember. At least that was my wife's motivation and she was not disappointed. Perfect for your 50's-60's era sock hop. One minor key: Assuming I did not have an equipment issue, several tracks sounded like the mono to stereo conversion did not work well; at least one channel (in this instance, the lead) was but faintly heard."
3,memories and surprises,"Memories from the 50's and 60's embraced us as we listened to some of our favorite ""courting songs"" and we enjoyed new ones as well."
5,Great songs from a great voice,This CD brings back great memories from 1960's and I was glad that I was able to find a copy. Thanks Amazon as I do not know where else I would have found it!!
1,I HAVE SONG WHEN OLIVIA KISSES REAL SEBASTIAN,"the song is called ""love"" by matt white and i had a hard time finding it too but it's because his cd doesnt come out until feb 2007. he has a myspace and the song was also in the movie little manhattan"
1,Misleading,I bought this CD right after seeeing the movie. HOw disappointing. Half the songs are score and they left off several songs from the movie. I am disgusted that I spent the money to buy this CD when I will nevver listen to all of the songs.BUYER BEWARE!!!!
5,i reli need to know the name of the song when olivia kisses the real sabastion,"please will someone teell me i have sseen the film 5 times but can't seem to find the name of the song, its the best film and the best song ever some one please help me!!!!"
3,that song viola is listening to on ipod,Can someone tell me if the song viola is listening to on her ipod at the bginning of the movie when she goes home is on the cd? If not can you please tell me what it is ??the song sounded good...
4,Incisive,Considering this book was written nearly 40 years ago I found that the authors incisive comments about Russian character to be right on the nose. Accurate and quite telling. Actually surprising me that nothing really has changed since then in many ways. An enthralling book and well written as you might expect.
5,fine stuff for the v'linists in my crowd.,"thanks for excellent quality disc. I know my ""string friends"" will appreciate this gift."
3,Plugging a gap in my knowledge of Rusian Music.,"Much more approachable music than I expected, and makes me wonder why I have never heard or played any Cui in my whole career as an orchestral musician - I'm 65! Thank you Amazon for having it available."
1,My Review,Side-by-side really good and toothpaste to their home countries and toothpaste to their own band's bank of rest is history yesterday that he would not a photograph by an independent of every time you need a store near the world's largest sites types digit the rest of the world y vCard to buy a variety in but I think it was in but the world's most powerful tool that you can get it was in but the world is used
5,Jack London's best,Extravagantly placed each word with grace. And thoroughly his best works for he told the story as if it had happened
4,White Fang,"This is a book that I missed in my youth so I ordered it as my first Kindle download. Although London's style is rather vintage, once I got into it that problem faded away and I was swept away with the drama of the Klondike days and White Fang's sad and confusing journey through a less animal sensitive time. London seems to be able to get right into a canine's thinking processes. It is a very interesting read, but I wouldn't recommend it for very young kids."
5,Excellent Book,This is a really good book. I read this when i was 12 and I loved it. It's about a wolf who is treated unfairly until two men come and help him.
4,White Fang Good or Bad?,"I thought that white fang was interesting, but not what i was looking for. I am an incredibly picky reader so this wasn't my cup of tea. It starts off sad when there are a few deaths. Later on the story is still a bit sad, but it starts to cheer up, white fang finds a new family and goes through many different owners. I give this book ****. If you like a deep interesting life story of a dogs challenges in the wild, this book is meant for you."
4,Good read,I hadn't read this book in years and I am so glad I choose to read it again. Couldn't put it down.
4,Brutally beautiful,"Still a classic because of its unique perspective. Rarely has an antihero been written with more insight into his motives. Read this after rather than before its companion classic ""Call of the Wild""."
4,An Old Favorite,"Another book from my childhood is White Fang, by Jack London.I bought this book at a book fair at school when I was nine. I cannot tell how many times I have read it. As a child, I mainly read it for the 'wolf' story, but as an adult, I have appreciated the deeper aspects of the writing. London was big on analyzing why people do what they do, not always correct imo."
5,"Too soon old, too late smart","I always put off reading this book. After I finished it, it's one of those books that I will treasure forever. It is the story of survival -- for man and dog. Loved it."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I had to read this book for a book club, but unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. I found it utterly boring and very slow. I made it about 70 pages into the book before I called it quits. Now, I almost never stop reading a book in the middle, but this book just wasn't worth it.First of all, there is no dialogue, which by itself makes the reading slow. Then, absolutely nothing HAPPENED in 70 pages. These two wolves have a litter, only one of which survives. That's it. In 70 PAGES!!!! I just don't have enough time to waste it on books like this. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I found it boring. Since I was only reading it for pleasure, not assignment, I didn't see any reason to finish it. It might have gotten better towards the end, but I gave it 70 pages to grab me and it didn't."
2,My review,this book begans with two men how are traveling across alaska. they are eatten by wolves. one wolf has a pup named White Fang. the pup is mistreated all throw out the book. he eventually found piece with a nice man named Scott. i recommend that you do not read this book. because it is very drawn out. loundon gives too many examples and discriptions. another reason i think this book was written by a ten year old. he repeats himself throughout the entire book.
5,One Thrill After Another!!,"White Fang is about a wolf that learns about life the hard way. He was left with his mother, Kiche, after his father died. They soon stumbled on an Indian Camp, where they were taken in by the gods. He learned that god hands meant hurt. The Indian dogs, Lip-Lip & the puppy-pack, tortured White Fang & soon became his worst nightmare. This made him stronger, & soon ruled over the dogs. Worse was to come of him, as he was traded to Beauty Smith. White Fang became pure rage & full of hatred. He was made to fight in blood sports until he was taken by Weedon Scott. With Scott, White Fang learned to trust the god's hands &, though it took time, he started to love. He was taken to California where he lived with Scott & his family, loving & being loved, instead of hating & being hated. It was truley a thrilling & great book!"
5,What can be said about this classic that hasn't been said?,I re-read this book recently after 50 years from my first reading. I don't think there will ever be another writer that will surpass London in story telling. Great book for young and old. Many emotions surface in this reading.
4,Classic Mayhem songs and lineup,"This live album captures the essence of Mayhem's sound at the top of their game, whether in reworked songs from their first three official releases or in the songs that made ""De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas"" great. Vocalist Dead, who shaped many of the concepts and much of the sound of the band, provides a searing, schizophrenic and disassociative performance which suggests all of the necro that black metal once intended. If you like ""De Mysteriis"" you owe it to yourself to get this also for comparison."
2,Mayhem rules; this disc you could take or leave.,"There's not a lot here if you already have De Mysteris Dom Sathanas and Deathcrush. The live versions of the songs are not as tight and not as well balanced (of course). On the other hand, if you're a 'true' Mayhem fan and like live albums, this will round out your collection quite nicely. It's almost worth it for the picture of Dead with the severed pig's head impaled on his microphone stand on the inside of the digipak."
1,Book was not original,I ordered this book for my sister. When my sister got it the book was not original. It was a Photo Copy of the original . I was very surprised when I saw it that way. Wonder why it got sent that way. Isn't it a copyright violation to do that ?
4,"Look Out Avril, There's a New Punker In Town","Skye sweetnam is louder and all-around a more punk rocker than Avril. Also, she's shown she can have awsome songs without having to add cuss words the way Avril does."
3,okay.,"when i listened to Tangled Up In Me on the radio, I thought it was okay, very sweet but the lyrics a tad too annoying. Then I looked her up on the Net and finds out she's a comparison to Avril Lavigne. Yes, I admit, the only similarity they have is they are both Canadian, write their own songs, and play pop rock. Yes, I also admit that Skye Sweetnam is louder than Avril Lavigne.According to science (secondary school science anyway), noise is unpleasant sound. And this suitably suits this album, hence 'Noise From The Basement'. Not saying it is unpleasant, but not saying that it is nice either. She could have been much much more better, but from the way this album is, things don't seem to be looking up for her.C+"
2,THIS is Skye Sweetnam????,"If you heard Skye's Number One, Tangled Up in Me, or Billy S., you'd think that's the type of music on this CD, right? WRONG! There is nothing like that except those three songs! And those are like the only good ones! The names of the songs are horrible! Don't use money on this CD when you can buy a MUCH better one like Ashlee or JoJo. All of the songs (except those three) are negative. She talkes about not liking people and stuff like that. The songs sound a lot similar. If you like Ashlee Simpson, you will NOT like this. If you like JoJo, you will NOT like this. If you like Hilary or Lindsay, you will NOT like this. I wish I never bought this CD. I used to like Skye a lot, but now things are changing. Number One, Billy S., and Tangled Up in Me are the only good songs. ""I Don't Really Like You""'s chorus is good, but not the rest. All the verses of all the songs sound so much like the same. This is overall a not-so-good CD."
5,That's Hot,"Skye Sweetnam is the best! I'm fifteen years old and I really thought this cd was awesome. Every song was appropriate for how kids around my age feel all the time. So, there's not really much to complain about. Skye's sixteen, so I wouldn't be comparing her as an Avril wannabe, she's simply a girl who can write music. I see a lot of potential in her. I heard about this album from my friend Courtney. I just bought it last Thursday and I even listen to it when I get a bath!!! As for the songs being short, that's totally fine too. That's how most punk rock albums I buy are. I like The Used and Taking Back Sunday. As for this album... this noise from the basement rocks. Keep up the coolness Skye."
2,Low Quality Printing and Binding,The content of this book is very good with plenty of explanations and examples in Java and C++. My biggest complaint is that the book looks like the pages were printed using a cheap laser printer and then glued together in a very poor binding. Pages in my copy are already starting to come loose after only a month of use.
3,"Disappointing, but what do I know?","I'm not the usual person to point toward the packaging and extras, but someone should show me how to fold these things. Amazingly cheap feeling for their price, I'm thinking I should have ordered something other than these discounted $99 muffs. I wish they had come with a cleaning cloth, case or instructions other than what was enclosed (the latter only), little things like that reinforce the sale and the absence of them of them has only left me wondering..."
3,Very functional but a pain to install batteries,Just does it's job really well in terms of muffling your ears from the gun noise and letting you hear people talk. I love that. Also the other best design factor is that the wire is fitted in the rear rather than on top of your head. Two HUGE pluses!But getting that done is a real pain as it needs batteries and you must solve a puzzle to install them. Instructions are for another model and when taking the parts off needed to install batteries you get scared your gonna brake the darn thing. Once you have the piece off says not to keep batteries stored inside...... Arg....Well this might make me buy a different more well engineered user friendly system later on.
3,Sizing is not accurate.,Size 9-10 is not accurate. They were too small. My wife wears size 8 1/2. Thoughr rhey would be plenty roomy. not so.
3,very good to heat the water but not easy to clean up,Very effective and fast heat the water.But during heating - very noisy and not easy to clean it up.
2,Second album ...not so pleasurable,Anyone who owns Rockell's first album knows that it was awesome and had that great freestyle beat. This sophmore album didnt have much freestyle sound to it and it kinda goes into a different kinda dance music. I would have to say that i only like a couple of the tracks on this album. The rest of it (especially heading towards the end)was starting to get very annoyng. I guess not everyone sticks to their freestyle roots forever.
1,"Frustrating, dirty appliance","I agree with the other reviews. The food processor is difficult to use. The blender is filthy and impossible to clean. You cannot remove the base and if you make the mistake of putting it in the dishwasher (as the instruction manual mentions) food particles wedge between the glass jar and the base. They are impossible to remove. I have to replace the blender jar and make sure I only wash it by hand. Luckily, I bought the unit with Diner's Club award points, so I only paid for shipping."
2,took long times,It took three more weeks to receive it. I was taking weekly quizzes without the text book
3,Helpful but General,"The writing style is direct and the organization is good. However, I often find with the Freeman's that their books tend to be generall and not specific enough. It is a book written for teachers teaching teachers (or researchers)who are not directly involved in the classroom."
2,A pretty Packard coffee table book and nothing more.,"Packard The Pride is a coffee table type book with some pretty pictures. The format is unusual being divided into chapters on individual cars. If you are interested in that car great, otherwise there is nothing. Even if the car your are interested in ""made"" it into the book there is little real information. The book is heavily prewar biased and does not even contain a 48-50 bathtub. Granted these may not be the most beautiful Packards but not to have one at all? In fact, there is little of interest for the postwar Packard fan period. If you want it for the pictures fine but otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere."
5,Packard,Received the product immediately after ordering--it was exactly how they had described it--in excellent condition! Thanks so much!
5,Absolutely wonderful.,This is a must have for all lovers of Christian and Gospel music. Natalie Wilson and the S.O.P. Chorale do an absolutely wonderful job. Calvary makes you want to just jump for glory. A great addition to any collection.
4,Slow read but valuable info,Book was a slow read but full of information. It was very outdated with no information of the modern internet or social age but several of the themes still hold true.
3,lost and found,"Back in the fall of -62 Larry Finnegan's ""Dear one"" was all over the airwaves in Scandinavia (#1 in Sweden, #2 in Finland, #1 in Norway). A truly great oldies collection is just like that, you find something you lost long ago. Which is also true for Dickey Lee's ""I saw Linda yesterday"", a huge hit in Scandinavia in 1963. Unfortunately the rest is just filler, at least for a Scandinavian audience. ""Sugar shack""? Yes, the played it like once on the radio over here, but at that time the Liverpool four and the rest of the British bands had made American pop obsolete for the following 2 years (that is, until all those garage bands came around, check them on the splendid ""Nuggets""-collection)"
3,"Not Remakes, Thank Goodness, But Poorly Done","You can trust Eric Records to give you the tracks that were originally on the charts, not remakes like you get from Madacy, K-Tel and St. Clair. That pleased me so much I was planning on getting the entire series of Hard To Find 45s. Unfortunately, the mixing and mastering went somewhat awry. Sugar Shack comes out with the organ kind of low in the mix, unlike on the 45. Bobby's Girl vocalist Marcie Blaine is lacking most of her familiar echo (BMG has that song on a CD and it's just like the 45). Possibly younger folks who hadn't grown up listening to the songs did the mastering. Mind you, I listened to this CD with headphones on. I didn't try it amplified through speakers."
4,Just what you need,"If you have held a spanner before and are not a complete newbie this book will provide you with all you need for the maintenance of this specific motorcycle.If you are new to motorcycle maintenance (like me) get a more general book as well.The pictures are clear once you know what you are looking at, but if you don't you may spend some time trying to find the bit in the picture on your bike."
4,Melodeath straight from......Texas?!?!,"That's right,while having a little metalcore thrown in the mix this is some top quality Melodic Death Metal from Dallas,Texas.Don't dismiss this as simply another metalcore band.Dryline has all the aspects needed in a Melodeath band,from the high shrieks and screams to some low growls.Though the production could be better but all the instruments make their impressions through the tight and sometimes quick double bass blast beats as well as the melodic riffs and brutal breakdowns.Think In Flames meets Killswitch Engage.So if you are able to find a copy of this hard-to-find disc snatch it up and throw down some green!"
4,Even Better Live,"I recently purchased Reach for the surface by Dryline at a show they were playing in Topeka, KS. I was blown away by thier realness, thier sincerity, and musicianship. The dual guitar onslaught completely blew the audience away, As I stood there with my jaw dropped, I thought to myself ""This is what the metal is all about"". I love bands like KSE, Unearth, Between The Buried and me but even they are missing something these guys have so much of, and that is......take a listen and you'll be able to fill in the blank. I love every track on this disk.For fans of Unearth, August Burns Red, Beloved US, Norma Jean and The Chariot. This is a SOLID album by a solid band. They are super nice guys too!! Buy this CD and support the REAL deal."
5,Just as good as their previous album.,This CD is exceptional!I highly recommend to listen the whole album because each song is special.ECDL did a great job :)
5,Dutton handbook,"The handbook to Dutton is a GREAT investment. It provides all the great information and images from Dutton, in a more succinct form. It has great tables and charts, and is great for referencing diagnoses, exam techniques, special tests, etc. If you are a PT student, or even a clinician, this is a great reference to have in your library!"
1,a real disappointment,"This book was a real disappointment. I purchased it be because it was so popular on amazon. The problem with it is that it is trying to be too much, and ends up being unweildy. It is written by a physical al therapist, and is not useful at all for a practicing physician."
5,Worth Every Penny,"Worth every penny! I love it, makes my messy kitchen much more fun! Also educational with learning velocity and how much you need to tilt the slides. I bought both original and deluxe set and the variety makes it more complex and enjoyable."
1,Digital copy unavailable for 12 months,"Due to 12-month Afghanistan deployment.Digital copy is subject to DRM. We were not allowed to connect our privately-owned laptops to any internet sources. The digital copy was therefore unreadable.By contrast, my digital copy of Disney movie (Tangled) would play under deployed conditions.Digital copy was my only option for viewing, due to the laptop not having a blu-ray drive."
1,Should specify men's ring...,"In the picture it doesn't look as bulky as it really is. I got it for my middle finger and it looks SOO big. If it had said men's ring I wouldn't have ordered it. It fit, but it's obviously not a woman's ring or even unisex."
2,Router,Router does it's job. Plunger had to be sent into the manufacturer upon receiving it for repair. It wouldn't slide or lock lock.
1,Missing bonus edge guide,"We received this item but were surprised to find that the bonus edge guide was not included. According to the box, it was supposed to be included (a $40 value). It does not appear to be a case of getting lost during shipping because the outside box was sealed and undamaged. This looks like it was removed prior to the item being boxed for shipping. We are very dissappointed with Amazon's lack of response in this matter. My husband is excited about using this router and did not want to return it and wait for another one."
3,Might be an interesting movie,"I can't say I found the plot to be at all believable, even with the Cold War over for two decades. I did like the two main characters, and it could definitely make for an interesting movie, but at over 600 pages, I would prefer to read Eric Ambler's ""A Coffin for Dimitrios"" at half the length, more plausible plot, and more engaging."
5,the matarese cirlce a suspenseful story of espionage,"This book draws you in and does not let you go. this book is about two spies, one working for russian intelegence and the other working for u.s. intelegence have a stickey situation where they want the other dead but fear there own lives are in danger due to a secret scociety called the matarese. this book is filled with suspense, drama, non stop action and most of all you get a look into the secret life of secret agents."
4,Edge of your seat,"I have always been a fan of Ludlum, this book is a reason why. Ludlum, is the master of International intrigue, and this is no different. At one moment we are in London, Paris, Washington D.C. and places all over the world. Scofield along with a Russian agent Talienkov, must stop a plot to control the world, through finacial avenues. These sworn enemies have to work together, to destroy this Circle. Many twists and turns and not every one is who they seem. Highly recommend this. This is a keeper."
4,It works.,"It is pretty basic, it is a metal cookie press. It is actually accurate when it says ""one press makes a cookie"". Works quite well. As with ALL manual cookie presses, you have to use a little muscle, but atleast it works.I can't say the same for some of the other electric presses (cough cough) *BonJour Cookie Factory*."
2,One-Armed Cookie Press,"Just returned this HEAVY beast to the store. The single arm would sometimes flip over the rod that ratchets down to press dough, once filled it cannot be flipped back over the now extended rod. This tool has to be filled from the bottom, so you have to remove the pattern and it's holder to fill, there is no flat area or air escape on top, so you cannot rap it against the counter to seat the dough easily. You need your second hand to steady the other end, because once you start pressing this thing wants to kick out. Three out of four cookies didn't turn out well, and I was using a recipe and pattern that was identical to one I have been using for decades. I have used a caulking gun-style press for years but the plastic parts do get fatigued and crack, and was hoping this more solid model would last longer, I loved the extra ring that stores all the disks and the handle folding flat for storage is a good idea in theory."
2,Thank God for Husbands,I got this for Christmas 2 years ago. I couldn't use it for a while because the instructions didn't explain that the notches need to face the front in order for it to work. I used it twice & it worked great then it started slipping. I had to make cheese wafers for a wedding this past weekend and am very glad that my husband was home because He had the strength to push out the dough and then we had to cut the wafers from the long strings of wafer. It was an awful mess and took way too long. Now the pin keeps falling out that holds the press bar in place. I give up!
3,Just ok,I started reading this book and after awhile i put it down for awhile...because there were some boring spots. but once i finished it i was glad i read it.
5,Repel Permanone Aerosol Bad Cans,THE PRODUCT WORKS GREAT BUT HALF OF THE CANS I ORDER WOULD NOT SPRAY
1,We are throwing this one in the trash!,I bought the Krups waffle maker because I thought it was a good deal and that it would be easy to clean since you can remove the plates. I was so wrong! My husband loves to make waffles and after a couple of uses the plates were no longer non-stick and we would have to pry the waffles off. It is now in the trash waiting to go to waffle maker heaven.
4,Pancake Combo,"Having received this order in record time with free shipping from Amazon.com was the first plus. The price is great. I priced the nailers by themselves and I found I got the compressor for practically nothing. That's a steal. My first project the very next day was a seven tray soap drying rack for my wife. This entailed seven 14x14"" frames and an orange crate style stand to hold them in. I was able to do this in one afternoon with the 16 gauge brad nailer. The compressor ran no more than 10min per hour handling over 1,000 brads at 70psi without a single problem. Not bad. I'd highly recommend this purchase for the home workshop or light industrial duty."
2,The work stands on its on.,Anthony de Mello is such an awesome writer that he doesn't need someone piggy-backing on his work. Read de Mello's original works rather than this book.
3,"Field Dressing and Butchering Deer: Step by Step Instructions, from Field to Table","I was hoping for more with this book, judging from the other reviews. It did provide some bits of new information, but there are other sources out there that provide far more clarity. The section on bringing your game animal out of the woods was tedious. The actual instructions for butchering were difficult to follow and I would have liked to see more diagrams. That said, there were some good points made and there were some decent diagrams regarding the various cuts of meat and how to access them on the animal."
3,"Quirky, original, not for everybody","The Smokers is about three teenage-girl-outcasts united by their own rebellion who decide to take revenge for their abuse by the the male gender. This movie is a black comedy! There are a few jarring scenes that are pretty hard to take (rape), but overall I found it a refreshing change from the usual teen slop served up by Hollywood. I would say avoid this movie unless you are one of those people whose taste in movies is so wide or so weird none of your friends trust you to recommend movies. But if you do like 'em weird then you might just like The Smokers."
1,Terrible and violent,Watch out - I thought this was going to angsty but fun. There was a gory and disturbing rape scene that completely ruined an otherwise ok (but not great) teen flick. Thora Birch is great though.
5,Excellent Book,"This book was just given to my 9 year old son, and he loves it. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone with a kid who loves basketball."
2,WII Remote Control Skins,"Well the seller sure ships fast. I think I received these the very next day after ordering. The problem is that the color is not what is portrayed in the picture. They are the darkest pink ever and don't match the WII fitness skin or the straps that I ordered in the pale pretty pink. This is not at all fault of the seller, just the product."
1,most annoying LOUD beeping sound ever,"I bought this toaster oven because I wanted one that looked sleek in my contemporary kitchen, and because I respected the Krups name. The ""done"" signal is the most high-pitched, LOUD annoying signal I have EVER had on any appliance .. I have had it less than 2 years and just this week the bottom coil died, so now only the tops coil toasts. I am on-line looking for a new toaster. I will NOT buy this one again."
5,Definitely a wire stripper,"This thing, man.. it does exactly what it is supposed to. For serious. I use this for 30g wire in controller mods, and it does just fine."
5,I love Chorus Line,"The music, by Marvin Hamlisch, is fantastic, and even more precious now that we have lost him, and the choregraphy was breathtaking. There isn't anything I don't like about this movie, which I have watched several times. Michael Douglas gives his usual fine performance along with the rest of the cast."
2,Where's the passion?,"Recently I read about the revival of ""A Chorus Line"" on Broadway. I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek. Well, somewhat disappointed here. I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film. It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable. Even songs which I had heard before, like ""What I Did For Love"", were reduced to barely a mention in the film. The film seemed to lack any real point. A bit of a yawner."
1,What a disappontment,"Anyone who has seen any live production of ""A Chorus Line"" will know what a disaster this film is. Richard Attenborough was a terrible choice as director and whoever butchered the story should never work again. What was once a truly remarkable piece about 'gypsy' dancers has been turned into a soap opera about Zack & Cassie. It's too bad that the only filmed record we have of the remarkable show is this waste of time. No wonder it flopped at the box-office. Better to buy the Original Cast album and close your eyes."
3,good grief,"A Chorus Line is a truly great show, when performed onstage keeping true to the original *ahem* SONGS, but the movie kind of failed in the attempt to re-create the magic. I mean, ""Music and The Mirror"" is a perfect example. Did they think it was too subtle for the movie-watching American public? Did it really have to be replaced with something as blunt as ""Let Me Dance For You""? Puh-leaze. And they cut out the entire montage, which really helps in exploring the character's personalities, etc. Why did Cassie seem like such an...annoyance? She did interrupt ""I Can Do That"". She did harass him into giving her a role. She didn't seem graceful, like in the stage version. (ie, falling while getting into the taxi) I really liked the Sheila, and I loved Terrance Mann. I also found the drag show monologue very well done. It's good, but not even close to the singular sensation it was onstage."
1,What DVD?,"Totally disappointed in Amazon service! Ordered DVD, oder confirmed, approximate delivery time given, notice of dispatch sent, then, more than 2 weeks later, notice of ""inability to deliver"" & notification of refund!! No understandable explanation given! There has been absolutely NO problem in the past. Very annoying!"
1,Total Garbage!,"As a Former cast memeber of the Frist National Company of A Chorus Line, I can truly say that this is Absolute trash. Horrible choreography, direction, casting! Go see a touring production of the real thing."
1,Heaven and saints preserve us,"Saw the play on Broadway. Saw the movie. Possibly the worst translation of a play to a movie in history. And even leaving the play out of it, one of the worst movies I've seen. Save your money."
4,Suprise! Suprise!,A Chorus Line has always been a favorite movie of mine because it has great music and exciting dancing. It can also be quite funny. Michael Douglas does a fabulous job as well as many of the other cast members. This movie is very fun but should not be watched with a serious mindset.
2,Checkbook Calculator not worth effort!,"This is 2nd, diff item purchased in this category. Not too happy w/operation as it doesn't want to hold info - needs to be reset even more than other one I bought!"
1,Frustration +++,"This calculator is junk! I must double check each and every button application because this calculator will either not register the number/process at all, or will enter it twice. If the calculator would accept the entries correctly, it would be exactly what I wanted, but I have resorted to using the calculator on my Kindle instead."
4,DB-413,It does what it is supposed to do it does't give you a grand total for the three records which my old discontinued Canon did. It works fine.
2,cute movie for me not my daughter shes 4,its not like the book but its ok. my daughter realy didnt like it but i thought it was cute.
5,A movie that is so enjoyable for toddlers,"My three year old son is absolutely obsessed with the Curious George tv show. So we finally broke down and got the movie for him to watch. He is enthralled with it. This movie tells the story of how George came to live with the Man with the Yellow Hat. Be warned, if your child is used to the TV show, this seems to have very little in common with the show other than George, and his yellow-clad companion. Still, my toddler doesn't seem to care, and enjoys this movie over and over. If you need to entertain a little one for an hour and a half, this is a good way to do it. The only con, when George gets captured and put in a cage, my son totally freaked out the first time and proceeded to scream and cry, so be prepared for that. (it's about 3/4 of the way through the movie)"
2,Epic waste of great voice talent,"My three-year-old son is a big fan of the Curious George TV show, and his dad and I love it because each show teaches something about science. So I thought I would get this movie for him on a sick day.The story hinges on a plot that makes little sense to a preschooler, and George's antics alone are not enough to hold his attention. My son didn't even follow the most interesting aspect, which is that this was showing us how the Man With The Yellow Hat meets George in the first place. For an adult, the jokes are lame and the plot insipid. After about 30 minutes my son asked me to turn it off and we went back to watching episodes on YouTube.I really regret purchasing this. My son might be able to understand it in a few years, but the movie won't be any better."
3,"Curious George is great, but what's the deal with the shadows???","Curious George is amazing, and his recent PBS show is probably the best kid show ever. This movie though pales in comparison, especially artistically: in every single scene we have pronounced shadows, as if we are watching some film noir of the past. As a result ""dark"" scenes (e.g. indoors) are extremely dark, while ""bright"" scenes (e.g. outdoors) are darkened artificially to emphasize everybody's shadows. What exactly is the reason for that? The director apparently bought a shadow generating software and wanted to put it to good use. However, you end up expecting Bogart and Bacall to show up in the next scene... Very poor choice that takes away the wonderful cartoon experience that one gets from the PBS series of the same name."
5,Great Movie,"Great Family Movie. Loved the theme song, stayed in my head a long time.My daughter loves curious george-this is a colorful action filled fun movie."
5,George,My grandkids love Curious George so I wanted to buy the movie for them. It is such a sweet movie.
5,Curious George DVD,My kids love this DVD. They love more short stories with curious George like on the TV that they learn more.
2,Very Finicky Machine,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this coffee maker. I was able to brew two good pots of coffee but the rest were bitter and awful. Also, the burnt smell at the end of the brew really bothered me after a while (even though it's not a part of the taste).I searched online for tips, tried various grind sizes, tried double filters (on top and bottom), tried single filters, weighed my beans, weighed my ground coffee, tried three-day fresh roasted beans, measured the water amount: nothing but bitter coffee. Yuk!In the end, I sent it back. I decided there were far too many variables involved in brewing a great pot of coffee with this machine. I know it is possible but replicating and being consistent wasn't something I was able to do. I opted for a Technivorm instead and have been really happy."
5,Is there a better coffee maker?,Nope. This baby makes great tasting coffee. We've owned it for several years now and never had a disappointing morning.
2,"Great Coffee, Broke in 1 month!","One problem with creating steam and building preasure to make coffee is that the maker is subject to stress. Unfortunately, black pastic doesn't hold up well and it cracked on the right side. Return policy is lousy and will probably just throw the thing away. Don't know what to do."
1,HATE IT,"WISH I COULD RETURN IT, BUT THREW AWAY THE BOXTHE COFFEE COMES OUT TOO WEAK, EVEN FILLING THE CONTAINER TO THE MAX, FOR 8 CUPS. DIFFICULT TO REMOVE THE GROUNDS AFTERWARDS."
2,Pretty enjoyable for a laugh.,"Hey, it's as good as any standard ... flick. It is hard not to laugh at most of the cuts here. Listening to people supposedly have sex and/or ... is an interesting listen the first time around. I bought mine when it originally came out back in '93. The disc also contained a blue Cyborgasm condom and some cardboard glasses that you were supposed to wear (called ""Eco-Glasses"") to keep out the light while listening. It became a novelty item quickly, and I used to mix parts of it into various club tunes when I used to DJ. It's at least good for that, even though the ... techno tune idea has been done to death by now. Parts of it do pique the occasional aroused interest, but for the most part Cyborgasm is good for a giggle."
3,not looking good,"Well, I dunno. The first thing I did was tighten up a router bit and I stripped the spindle lock. Now I need two wrenches. Hope this isn't a sign of things to come."
