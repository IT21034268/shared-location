3,Great Cd But Can Get Old,"I think this is a Dont get me wrong this is a awesome cd. Buty there is one large problem. Most of the songs sound the same. Well thats not such a bad thing if you liek the songs but after you listen to them for awhile you kind of start to get bored with it. I really like some of the songs on this cd such as Die, Alright and Hate To Say I Told You So. Plus some of the others. Really thoguh you liek want a good punk album pick it up!"
3,"I came, I saw...","Swedes in suits and bow ties pretending to be rock n roll stars, what more could you ask for? Howlin' is truly a modern day Victor Willis."
4,Lots of fun,"Where the Strokes are more of a garage band, the Hives have really embraced the punk spirit. A lot of the songs have punk anger yet it's obvious the band are having a lot of fun. I would say this album hits the mark more than pop punk bands like Green Day and Blink 182. The Hives aren't so concerned with hooks and catchy choruses. This album is so much fun to listen to! It's noisy and loud and you will still find yourself singing along."
2,You Got To Be Kidding,"If this is the future in music we are [in trouble]. With all the hype about these guys I expected something better than a cheap imitation of early Kinks or Romantics. Punk is just a code word for I cant play this equipment,but I look cool. These guys cannot play,the guitar playing is somewhere above Sid Vicious & less than the dead Mark Bolan,and he knew all of 9 chords. If you see this in a budget rack for 3 bucks,it might be worth it if you are hard up. Save your money and spend it on Coors & the twins."
1,There's a reason why punk died...it was terrible,"I laugh every time I hear people proclaim this or that band as ""punk"". That ... music died a long time ago and people still want to milk it. Punk was about bad playing, bad singing, and statement making. The statement made was ""We Suck"". And just as so called ""punk"" bands before them the Hives fit that statement. The singing, if you can call it that is god aweful. The musicianship is non-existant. The length of the cd should tell you about the song craft. The amazing thing is that people are eating this ... up. So if you like garbage than by all means buy this. If you insist on proclaiming punk your music taste at least listen to the source like The Ramones, The Clash,..etc."
1,Destroyers of Rock,"...I first heard of this band when their video for ""Main Offender"" appeared on MTV2.Both the video and the song were so aggravating that it was'nt even funny.Then I heard their song for Hate To Say Told You So.It was way too aggravating.Some how,and I don't know why,this song became a hit,proving that people will listen to any garbage these days...Peace Out."
2,Lets Think Now,"With all the horrible music that the industry is putting out today it is tempting to jump on anything that does not totally stink. Resist! The Hives are not a horrible band but they certainly are not on the same level as The Pixies. In an interview with Rolling Stone lead singer ""Howlin"", as he calls himself, is quoted as saying that he does not listen or even like a lot of music. That would explain the total lack of diversity that he shows as a singer. In a music industry that is surrouned by pre-fab boy bands and and annoying wanna be Korn childern (god knows why) this may seem like a relief but just becuase someone slaps the label Punk on themselves does not make them worthwhile. Investigate other avenues of music before succumbing to this new wave of surface punk."
2,"unoriginal, derivative","people have latched on to this hives album as if it signifies something ""new"" about punk rock. garbage: they're just ripping off bands like Turbonegro and the Hellacopters who have had a massive underground punk following. since they're from sweden, chances are they've been to a number of Hellacopters concerts, and have probably caught Norway's Turbonegro touring. i can't stand bands who are built up as the next ""new thing"", but everything they write is just a rip off of great rockandroll pioneers.the main reviewer said they were loud and raw, or something to that affect. listen to Guitar Wolf, Turbonegro, the Hellacopters, Electric Frankenstein, and the Nation of Ulysses instead. then you'll see what ""loud"" and ""raw"" truly are."
2,"trends, trends, trends...",First the Strokes with classic rock rewrites and now the Hives with Rolling Stones rewrites. Who knew that Oasis were groundbreaking a few years ago by being a successful coverband first.Don't buy this kids... it will rot yout brain.
3,Dig deeper for this kind of sound!,"Alright, these guys rock-no argument. However, if you go back to the late eighties/early nineties you'll find some wicked examples of the Detroit/post-punk/garage sound. Sweden's Union Carbide Productions were cranking out some serious Stooge-like mayhem, and Austrailia's Lime Spiders had the Marshall stack sound along with a vocalist that sounded like a combination of Gerry Rosalie/Alice Coopper/Iggy Pop/Mitch Ryder-yeah that's baaad!!!! And last but not least were England's Thee Hypnotics; these guys were perhaps a bit more psychedelic than the above mentioned groups, but they also sported a heavy MC5/Stooges attack. If you enjoy this genre then go and do some soul searchin' yeah!"
5,EXHAUSTING AND MANIC,"Theis Retro/Punk/Pop. That's what I'm calling it. It's only 28 minutes long. That's a good thing, becuase you won't be able to take more than that. And that's in a good way. Short, well constructed songs. LOUD. MANIC. WILD. The songs frow into each other. Sounds like The Romones on amphetimines. Great disc. Real structured chaos. At the end you're so exhauted that you're grateful it's only 28 minutes, cause you won't be able to take anymore. A truly emotional draining experience. If you want an experience, then buy this. I think it's great."
2,not what i wanted,"The coconut hut has a very small whole that most crabs won't fit through and its too hard to cut. The background is rolled up so its hard to put in place, you'll have to put it under a heavy book or something and they only give you two, tiny velcros to attach it with. The sand is smaller than what is pictured, its not colored either. The replacement shells are worthless, they are so tiny only very small crabs could use them, smaller than any i've ever seen for sale. The food is okay, feeding shells are nice size. the sponge is very small they cut it instead of giving you a naturally formed sponge."
1,Don't get this not worth the money,I bought this because my daughter love my hermit crabs and she want to start a tank of her own. I told her she had to pay for at least half the cost of set up. When we resided this first the sand bag was riped open and leaking every where second the bag of sand shown is a 2 lbs bag not what was in the box it was a 1/2 lbs bag. Third The crab shack was tore up and busted. Don't buy this at any price. Thank you.
1,Might have been good.,"Purchased this twice as a gift for my father in law. First time I only received the gel insert. Ordered again thinking it was just a mistake, got just the insert again. Too bad it didn't arrive with the outer case as shown. Amazon was great with the return though, emailed a return slip within minutes."
5,A must for Soccer Games,"Lava Buns is a great item for comfort during cold and windy sports events. It maintains its heat for the whole game (1 1/2 to 2 hours)and is easy to warm in the microwave. Be sure not to overheat as the inner packet can swell up and split its seams making it unusable. The directions say to heat three minutes on each side, but through experience and having to buy a new one, I found that two minutes on each side works just as well. Also, do not heat the whole unit. You must take the inside out of the cover and heat just that. It is very light weight and easier to carry than the electronic heated seats."
1,A Dud,"I bought ""Lava Buns"" to use when deer hunting (November weather in WI) and watching hockey games (on cold aluminum bleachers). I arranged for my wife to give the ""Buns"" to me as a Christmas gift, and I was very eager to try them Christmas evening. I followed the instructions for microwaving the gel insert for exactly three minutes (CAUTION: THE GEL PACK IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE WITH BARE HANDS AFTER MICROWAVING), and then I placed the unit under my butt while I watched some TV. The unit was pleasantly warm--as felt through normal slacks--for almost one hour; after that, the warmth factor decreased so much that I could barely feel any warmth at all, even through my ""street pants."" There is NO WAY Lava buns would put out effective heat for anywhere near six hours, especially in a cold environment, and especially to be felt through heavy outdoors-type clothing. I returned the Lava Buns for a refund using Amazon's easy-return policy."
3,Cushion too big to fit in my microwave,"I'll be giving this heated seat cushion away. Bought it for myself, but it is too big to fit into my microwave. (Bad planning on my part.) Looks like it might be nice for someone who has a large microwave and is thus able to heat up the Lava Buns cushion!"
5,Very Cute,"This book is a hoot to read and the kids love it. I added a popcorn machine and gave it as a gift, was a huge hit."
1,Horrible!!!,"First let me say that I am a big Nugent fan. I have enjoyed his performances for years and I thought his last DVD Full Bluntal... was quite good. It's not so much the performances which are a bit forced, even for Ted, but the horrible camera and editing work that was done here. Not only does the editor constantly switch shots, but many of the selected shots are just stupid. There are many moments where Ted is playing some really nice stuff and the camera is somewhere else??!! I blame everyone involved from the camera crew, who are terrible, with shots of the floor, shots of Ted hidden behind his monitor so all you see is a full shot of his monitor??!! What is that all about?? And how could the editor see that and include it?? And how could Ted see this video and put his stamp of approval on it?? Just lazy I guess, which is a real shame. If you all cannot do any better then put the cameras down and forget it. As for his fans just buy the cd you will be much better off."
2,EGH! .....SHROOMS........ SHMOOMS!,"I saw the trailer for this film on HD NET and it looked promising. I was happy to hear that I was going to get a free sneak peak showing opening night in my home on HD NET! The movie is about a group of campers who go to Ireland to do ""shrooms"" or ""magic mushrooms""(what they were called in my day)in the woods. Having dabbled in many things in my youth, I know this is a bad, BAD idea! The films starts off like so many other horror movies going to unfamiliar surroundings to party and have sex, then tell a scary story to freak everyone out before going to bed. Lots of cliché's fill this watch-able but, ultimately forgettable horror film. I did like the ending a little, as it seemed to make this all seem possible. If you see it coming on cable you might want to give it a look but, it's nothing special just a time waster."
5,Shrooms,"The depth of mushrooms induced haze is like urban legions sirealisiem left me in my own flashback minus the sires killers or killer? That the movies give to me more then I expect, Nightmare and devils' are among us. HAHAHHAH"
2,Never made me care what was going to happen,"The disappearance of two teens from the same school leads Charlie to an amateur-run safe house for teens that is sheltering a beautiful Pakistani girl trying to avoid a forced marriage. But when the manager is shot, Charlie must wade through a pit of secrets to find the would-be killer.I am giving up on this series. The characters continue to be awful and the convoluted stories don't hold my interest. I got halfway through and realized I didn't care what came next."
3,"Useful, non-rigorous reference","I used this book in a sophomore-level probability course for electrical engineers and I found the book a bit confusing at the time. The notation is somewhat awkward and examples are interleaved throughout general concepts, making it difficult to discern key ideas.During my doctoral studies, I gained a different perspective. I consistently found the book to be a valuable starting point for many concepts and I now find the examples a quick way to brush up on elementary principles.However, Leon-Garcia doesn't give a thorough approach to probability theory (there are essentially no theorems) and avoids set theory almost entirely. To really put my teeth into something, I would have to track down a more advanced text for any particular concept I was interested in. Basically, Leon-Garcia tries to seperate ""Probability and Random Processes"" from rigorous mathematics.... something similar to eating fat-free cheesecake."
5,One of my favorite authors,"Julie Smith is one of my very favorite authors, and Skip Langdon, her protagonist, one of my favorite sleuths! I've read every one of her novels. I suggest starting with the 1st of this series and progressing through in order. It's not necessary in order to follow the plots, but the growth of the character is fun to see.Julie knows New Orleans, and the city is an important backdrop for the stories. You get a real local's eye view of the city as well as stirring mysteries in this series!"
3,Misses some important points,Mr. Maller is an important name in dog training and he knows what he's talking about. The book is written in a simple language and gives easy to follow instructions. It misses the fact that when training a dog there are always problems. It doesn't cover the area of problem solving to any considerable extent. The book lacks photographs of any kind (not even in the cover) which I consider essential to any training book. The info is too superficial.
4,A work in progress!,"This is a good book but you must have patience and a dog with at least a little concentration power. Dolly has learned house breaking and sit very well, she turned one Jan. 10. Come is a work in progress - sometimes she comes and other times not. She has learned not to run out the front door when I open it but to go look out the window. She knows that she can run out the back door into the finced yard. She learned to go out 2 doggie doors (one in the house and one on the deck) to get into the yard. She hates rain and refuses to go out in it!"
3,Needs Updating,"It's an old book with techniques from the '70's (it's published in 1977). If you prefer a book with more positive reinforcements such as treats, petting, etc, I would recommendTrain Your Dog - The Positive Gentle Method--it's better to visually see how to do it.Also, the title made me curious, '21 Days to a Trained Dog' but looks like it would take longer than 21 days, unless you really train your dog every day, at least five times of 5-10 minutes per day (probably even more depending on your dog). If you want a book, besides the DVD I suggested, I'd recommendThe Everything Dog Training and Tricks Book--yes, this one contains easy tricks too!"
4,1st of the bradley anthology series,"An anthology can be ruined by one or two stories. Bradley has a knack for picking the finest. She sets a standard for this anthology which she keeps throught the whole series. This series has led me to sample further works by the authors inside. I discovered Jennifer Roberson, Dianne Paxson, Robin Bailey, and many others through their stories in the series and the intros by MZB. I only which the amazing Charles Saunders was more prolific. Buy it, sit back and enjoy."
4,Solved my problem.,"Installed easily, passed smog test, all went well. Terrific price far below dealer. Quality wire, connector, sensor. Computer error code cleared itself, after installing this , 'upstream'."
5,Book 6 of the Tillerman Family Saga - Spellbinding!,"""Sons from Afar"", book 6 of 7 about the indomitable Tillerman family focuses on two brothers searching for their father. It keeps us jumping from page to page and we hold our breath through all of their adventures. Read by itself it is exciting to the very end. Read as part of the Tillerman series it fleshes out the family and adds dimension to all of them who we have grown to love. I only wish Cynthia Voight has written 15 books about the Tillermans. They are real to me, andwith every book, I want to read more! By the way, these books are for everyone! I am 67 years old and while children may love these books, I think grown adults will love them even more!"
1,This book was horrible,I read this book and I hated it. It was boring and I lost interest in it really fast. I advise you to not read this book. It is not good at all.
2,"From Begining To End, This Story Keeps You Wanting LESS !","This story, from the begining is VERY boring....you would think from the description that it would pull you into it and keep you there but it did just the opposite. I think the book might have been better if Voigt would have cut down on the long description. I only give it 2 *'s"
5,Incredible!,"I challenge those who diss Josh Groban's voice on this DVD to try and sing better themselves. I think people only criticize what they themselves cannot do, but wish they could.As far as I'm concerned there is no better vocalist in this genre than Josh Groban, and this DVD proves it. No, it's not as polished as a studio recording would be, but the emotion that Josh puts into every song doesn't need that kind of polish. It's real and truthful. And at the top of my Christmas wish list."
2,Live at the Greek,"I posted a review on the major website for Josh Groban's concert, ""Live at the Greek."" The rating is the same for a very different performance. Check out the major site to see the majority of reviews. My best advice is to review the Concert DVD and CD before you buy. The only thing you have to lose is your hard-earned money."
3,Glad I'm not the only one.,"I am relieved to see that I am not the only one out there who felt that Josh's voice sounded nasally and strained. It became painfully obvious to me in the first song on the cd, and I had wondered if I was just hearing things. I don't know if it was nerves or just a worn out voice, but he doesn't sound like he normally does. I read in other reviews how we needed to ""tweek"" our stereo's to get the optimum sound quality, but you know, that's not something you should have to do right off the bat.I can understand Josh's desire to ""strike while the iron is hot"" and get himself out there as much as possible, but I really think it is a detrament to his lovely instrument.Frankly, I would rather not see anymore concerts if this is the toll it will continue to have on his voice. And what's with all the concert videos? Josh, give us what we really want, new music showcasing the beauty and range of your tremendous voice!"
2,"After watching ""Live at the Greek""","I decided not to buy the DVD and not to buy a concert ticket. I see where the concert go'ers state that this recorded concert is ""exactly"" like the way he is in concert. Well, that's enough for me. I could barely watch the PBS concert on TV without groaning, Groban's voice was so bad. I enjoyed hearing ""Caruso,"" a difficult song for anyone, but the special effects were childish. It just gave me a headache. Groban is not a stage performer, his only true talent lies with his voice. When that voice is nasal, well it's not worth watching. Groban can't afford another bad performance like this one or the fans will be departing in a Los Angeles second."
1,The Greek is poorly done!,"I bought my ""Greek"" concert DVD+CD here at Amazon.com. I watched it yesterday for the first time and listened to the CD. This concert is so poor it's hard to believe that a slew of professionals had any hand in it. Josh Groban's voice IS nasal and poor in a few of the songs. The camera work is sloppy and visually poor. While it may be a terrific keepsale for those who attended his concerts, it isn't for me. I have all the CD's and the first concert Groban did. Those are worth keeping and I listen to them often. This is going back as soon as I can get to the post office."
2,Can't Believe it!!,"I can't believe I'm rating Josh Groban so low. I absolutely love everything he ever did and bought up his first concert DVD for me and so many others it wasn't funny! But I really have to be painfully honest here, I just couldn't watch my Greek DVD without wanting to cry. Regardless of how much I love my other Groban music, this one is really, really bad. Josh's voice is so strained on ""Mi Mancherai"" that I fast-forwarded it too get to the next song. Was that really Josh? Apparently it was because it's not just here that I've read the poor reviews. I got my DVD from Barnes & Noble and people are mentioning it there too. All sites are saying the same thing....that Josh is nasal and strained. It comes across painfully clear. I did return my DVD to the store for a refund. I'll probably buy his next CD, but I'll absolutely do it after I hear a sample at the store first."
2,Live at the Greek,"I wish I could write a glowing review of Josh Groban's concert DVD, but I can't. I loved and bought all of his CD's and the first concert combo until it came to ""Closer."" Although I liked a couple of tunes, it wasn't exciting or even run of the mill. I had high hopes for his Greek concert though. There are too many problems with the concert that have been mentioned often here, and I agree they make the concert a disappointment for Groban. Hopefully he can rescue his voice AND make another studio album that is appealing. His Live at the Greek concert isn't. It was just one disappointing turn after another. And Yes, please retire ""To Where You Are."" Performers can be categorized by repetition of one song. Groban already is and if he isn't careful, he won't even have enough fans to do that."
1,"Yes folks, this is the REAL Josh Groban","I've read the reviews here because I was in denial when I got my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set. I kept saying to myself ""This CAN'T be the real Josh Groban,"" and all that other stuff including excusing his poor performance. After reading the past few reviews by people who actually attended more than one live concert, I realize this is what Josh Groban really looks and sounds like Now. Well, now that it's been confirmed by the forgiving fan base (they call themselves ""Grobanites""), I know it's time for me to move on. Unfortunately for Groban I can hear perfectly well and can hear every bad note he forces out. Fortunately for his existing fan base, they'll have lots of cheap DVD's to buy because mine will also be going to my used record store. If anyone hasn't bought it yet and is contemplating a purchase, look to ""half.com"" or your used record store. I'm sure they'll be lots of cheap ones to choose from."
2,Not my Josh!!,I waited patiently for Josh's next concert and I can't believe this!!!! It can't be my Josh!! His voice sounds so bad I wanted to cry. He looks good but all the stupid views of older women were even worse. I can't return it so I'll be selling it to the used music store. I love Josh Groban so I'll wait until I get something that has his beautiful voice back.
1,DREADFUL!!,"Is that really Josh Groban in front of me?? Am I really Hearing Josh Groban, a young man with the stunning voice?? Josh now sounds very poor, very nasal and looks as bad as he sounds. Hopefully this is the worst music he records. I don't believe he can afford to alienate any more fans. From the looks of it, he's lost a few here. Thankfully I saw it on PBS and decided this concert DVD was not worth the purchase price."
2,"Josh Groban, LATG",The fact that reviews here are so bad doesn't surprise me in the least. After I watched my DVD of the concert in L.A. it took a great deal of effort to pick my jaw up off the floor. At the sake of being repetitive (and it must be done) it's Josh Groban's voice that's the sour point of the concert. It made the whole experience of watching this DVD a miserable one. For Groban's sake I hope he recuperates before releasing the next CD. I'm hopeful that he will because I am a fan. I'm just not sure if I'll remain one if this continues.
2,Josh Groban's Greek--My only return for 2004,"Josh Groban's Greek dvd-cd set was my first and only return for the entire year and I bought lots of cd's. It was just one major disappointment. It was for no other reason than his voice was very nasaly, very poor. As far as his keyboard and drum skills, anyone could do that (and probably better). I have to add that it was not enjoyable overall. ""Per Te"" was good, so I bumped my rating up slightly to two stars."
3,Live at the Greek with Josh Groban,"Josh Groban's concert was enjoyable. I watched it this past Friday on our local PBS channel. He performed all songs that he recorded on his first and second CD's. Most certainly they sounded different because he didn't have the Coors, David Foster, Lili Haydn et al, on this concert. He did have Lucia Micarelli performing with him and that was lovely. Every note that she played seemed to be coming from her soul, if not shown on her face. Since I have all of the music in this DVD and CD, I won't be getting this concert. But I think Josh's next CD is something to look forward to because we will see for sure which direction he plans for his future."
2,"Very Disappointed with ""Live at the Greek""","I am a dedicated Josh Groban fan and even I have to admit that I'm disappointed with my concert DVD. Where's the gorgeous guy with the equally gorgeous voice?!? I read a few reviews and people call his voice ""nasaly"". I agree that I hear it too on my DVD. This is very disappointing because I was so excited to find out he had a new concert DVD. He's trying to change his image and that's okay with me as long as I still have a DVD I can watch. I tried to love the Greek concert but just gave up. Too many shots of screaming women ruined it too. Especially when it's at the cost of seeing Josh, which is the only reason why I bought the DVD in the first place."
2,"Nasaly Voice Haunts Josh Groban at the ""Greek""","Groban can't seem to ditch the nasal, strained voice in the first half hour of ""Live at the Greek."" As noted by many, many people here, it's obviously an issue with Groban and although he gets better later, I could hardly bear to hear it. He can be a great singer if he keeps up a schedule and stays with a vocal coach. The Greek is definitely not his best and hopefully not his worst. Groban has lots of appeal but people buy his music for his voice and no other thing. Throw that away and it's one dull concert. This is pretty close."
2,The Trill is Gone (but not for long),"Yes, I'm singing the blues. But hopefully not for long. Josh Groban's newest concert ""Live at the Greek,"" is not the best I've heard. There are repeats of older material, such as ""To Where you Are."" The CD is miserly with only a few songs. My biggest disappointment is with the DVD. I was hoping for more from ""Closer,"" like the absolutely gorgeous ""My Confession, or his first in French ""Hymne a L'amout. No such luck. Josh strains on a few songs and it translates over to the CD and DVD. He's definitely at his best when recording in a studio and performing in a closed theatre. For those of us who have not attended a live concert, his dramatically changed looks and performance style are a shocker. I will be looking for the new CD when it comes out."
1,This concert is TERRIBLE,"Good Grief I can't believe this poorly done, badly sung concert!!And now they're trying to sell the DVD!! I watched it on TV and switched the channel after the first hour. I was actually happy to have the PBS Pledge Breaks. Josh Groban is a singer, making money off his trade. He's a performer and we're the customers. Whether I want to buy it or not is my decision, but this is the place for REVIEWS and I'm chiming in with mine. Josh Groban's ""Greek"" concert is TERRIBLE. The man is nasaly, warbly, strained and looks like a bum. PERIOD. Would I buy it? Absolutely not. Would I come here and make excuses because I like him? Ditto. He may be a nice guy but that's pretty easy to do when you're a very, very rich guy. What I expect is someone who actually can sing through a concert and that is what I would buy, not this mess. I need my money more than Groban does and I work harder for $20 than Groban. As a matter of fact, he's not even trying here."
2,Just my Opinion,"I've watched the ""Greek"" concert three times now. It's so painful to say that Josh Groban can do anything less than GREAT, but this is much less than what I've come to expect. Nobody is perfect but when I spend my money on music nowadays, I spend it cautiously. I am a fan and will stay that way."
1,"QUITE AWFUL, EVERY DREARY MINUTE","I'm so disappointed with Josh Groban's performance and how badly this performance has gone. I'm happy to see that someone, or a few someones out of the over 250 reviews enjoyed it. They can certainly buy my DVD. I'm lucky because I was able to sell it to our local used DVD shop. My sister wasn't quick on the draw. She tried to do the same and the shop told her they had enough copies to re-sell, with no buyers. I could tell the story of my family and mention how many children I have in my home but do YOU really care?? Just take some good advise and listen to it in a record shop BEFORE you buy it. Don't take my word for it, or any other rabid Grobanite for that matter. After all, it's YOUR money."
2,"Unfortunately, Josh ROCKS at the Greek","Josh Groban's attempt to jazz it up at the Greek falls short because his voice, not his rock-style presence, is what people buy. Unfortunately for Josh his voice is poor during one-third of the concert."
2,"Returned My ""Greek"" also","I've read about 20 of the reviews and see that I'm not the only one disappointed enough to return the ""Greek"" DvD. I won't keep it around because it's just not good. Josh Groban sounds poor, but it's not my problem, it's his."
2,"Weak, Nasal Voice Troubles Groban's second concert","A weak, nasal-sounding Josh Groban pretty much ruins his second concert, ""Live at the Greek."" Sure his voice is powerful, but the weakness is in his ability to gain control over the vocals and stop singing through his nose. I didn't buy this concert DVD because of it and because so many of the songs on this DVD were done in the first concert with superior results. Of course it does happen with performers, especially when they start so young. They develop into whatever they prefer when they mature. But if Josh Groban isn't careful, he'll just become a part of music history."
1,Major Problems with Josh Groban's Greek,"I can't believe it!! I got my order from Amazon yesterday, with a total of 5 copies of Live at the Greek (one for me and four for gifts). It's true!! Josh Groban sounds poor, strained and nasal in a few of his songs. All of it is getting returned to Amazon and I've never had to return anything to them in the past. I have to rush out and buy lousy gift cards. The major issue is his voice which leads to the fact that no one should be expected to buy this OR buy the excuses (a defective DVD???). IF the DVD was defective ALL of the songs would sound the same. This miserable excuse for music was released before Christmas for the shopping season. I didn't see it on PBS but I just trusted that Josh Groban's concert would be as great as the first. That trust has now been shattered. Never again!!!"
2,Sad to Say This about Josh Groban!,"I absolutely loved all of Josh Groban's CD's and his first concert was so beautiful, it was fantastic. But I too am sad to say that I was shocked at the changes he has made and none of them for the better. His voice is so bad, very nasal, very noticable. Groban looks sloppy and the general swirling circus around him is just too distracting. Only a few selections are actually from ""Closer"" and with the exception of ""Per Te,"" and ""Mi Morena,"" the songs in this concert aren't the best. They left out one of the most beautiful songs ""My Confession,"" for the dull ""Remember When it Rained."" Groban really should let the professional songwriters and musicians do their jobs and just focus on singing. That's the problem here with Groban trying to be everything BUT a good singer. Believe me, it shows. This concert is just one big disappointment."
2,Josh Groban can do BETTER,"Yes, I bought Josh's ""Live at the Greek"" concert DVD. Yes, I returned mine also. It's just that Josh's voice is awful and he could have done better. I don't blame anything and my DVD worked great, it's just that Josh's voice didn't. All the other on-stage stuff didn't make me ignore the fact that he sounded so bad. I'm lucky enough to have gotten my money back."
2,Josh Groban,"Our PBS is showing Josh Groban in concert also. It's Spring so we must have another Great Performance to beg for money! The first time Josh Groban was on PBS was so memorable. It was actually the first time I loved every minute of a Great Performance on PBS and even enjoyed the pledge drives because they interviewed Groban during them. This time I could hardly believe the changes in Groban. His looks, the concert venue, and his voice were so very different. I always thought he had a good voice and enjoyed his appearances. This one was not very much to watch, and appeared to be more of a rock concert. Groban doesn't do rock very well, and neither does his voice. The concert was not much to speak about. I didn't buy this one this time."
3,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I think this concert, while certainly not his best work, does well for Josh Groban. His style is less formal, more interactive with the audience (hundreds at the Greek). The vocals are from previously released material and does include new ""Closer"" selections but not all. His voice is mostly strong with a noticable problem in only one song that I could detect. All in all a good performance concert by Josh Groban"
3,Josh Groban was good at the Greek,"I thought Josh was good in his second concert. He does look different and his voice seems to be changing. I loved ""My December"" and my favorite of all time ""Alejate."" This is a decent concert but not terrific. I also taped it from the PBS broadcast so I'm happy to add it to my Groban collection!"
2,The Greek Concert Not Enjoyable,"Josh Groban's second concert could have been as marvelous as the first, but it wasn't. While everyone expects to see a young singer change through the years, we shouldn't expect one of those changes to be a very bad voice. I heard the nasaly voice from the beginning. It's really a shame because I'm sure that all of this is due to the lack of a good voice coach. Whatever the reason I was very shocked at how bad he sounded and even more disappointed with ""Live at the Greek."" My disappointment was multiplied because I bought it at a store that doesn't take returns. I'll definitely know better in the future."
2,Lucia Micarelli was Wonderful at the Greek,"Lucia Micarelli was beautiful, and performed beautifully at the Greek Ampitheatre. But who on earth was that nasaly, sloppy guy singing? Lucia was so perfect in a lovely gown and as she played each note her face showed such emotion. It was easy to get carried away. But then that same guy kept getting on the stage attempting to actually sing through his nose!!If not for that singer all all those camera shots of the silly women in the audience, Lucia Micarelli's concert would have been perfect.Oops! I just noticed. It wasn't supposed to be Lucia's concert. It was for some guy named Josh Groban. Oh, he must've been the sloppy rock guy with the bad voice! Who on earth would give this guy a whole concert to sound and look so bad?Bottom line. Lucia Micarelli was wonderful at the Greek."
2,Josh Groban's Voice is better than LATG,"I think someone wrote here that Josh Groban is better than what we saw at his Live at the Greek concert. I agree. It was a bad night and a bad time for him. But we're rating the DVD, not an actual experience sitting in a concert audience. While I don't want to rate anything by Josh Groban so low, I can't help it. His voice is very congested and it's difficult to listen to. We are seeing re-runs of the concert because it's pledge week! Even seeing it again, I came to the same conclusion."
2,The Greek has many flaws,"The biggest flaw with the Greek concert is Josh Groban's voice. Sometimes it's powerful and clear but most of the time it isn't. Unfortunately Groban's voice issues show up at the start in ""Mi Mancherai"". I read that the concert DVD was recorded over two days and that's puzzling. I can't believe that over two days they couldn't get clear recordings of Groban's singing most of his songs. I also think that they didn't have the best (or even good) people recording the concert. There are too many bumpy camera shots and the sound is not good either. Very sloppy work."
2,One Can Only Hope!,"I have hope that Groban gets better in his next release. ""Live at the Greek"" was one big disappointment, for all the reasons stated by so many other fans. His voice was nasal, he wrenched poor to average performances. As a musician, he's a better singer. Problem is that Groban wants to be all things to all people and it shows. He should leave the songwriting, musical arrangements and instrument playing to the true professionals. He should concentrate on his vocals! Let the better and more mature talents do those jobs.After all, I didn't originally buy Groban's CD's because he was a great piano player!"
2,"Josh Groban, ""Live at the Greek""","Our PBS station is now having a pledge week also and they showed Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert last night. Good grief what's happened to Josh Groban? Within minutes I was at a point where I could hardly bear to listen anymore. His voice was powerful but very congested and nasal. I really wanted to go to one of his concerts this year but this performance was quite poor. I don't think I will take a chance.What Josh Groban needs to do is stay in an enclosed theatre to perform, and perhaps cut back on his concert touring. But I think he knew that before this latest concert schedule was announced. From what I read in other sites and this one, Live at the Greek didn't sell. Of course I could tell why. I could hardly watch it on my TV for free."
2,I will be returning this one!,"I bought my Live at the Greek DVD over the weekend and watched it yesterday for the first time. It's hard to believe I'm hearing the same Josh Groban! I'm beyond shocked at the changes since the Pasadena concert (also recorded live) in 2002. In just two short years he went from being a guy with a gorgeous voice without compare to a congested singer. This concert was a confusing mix of genres including Pop, Classical, Rock and whatever you want to call the intro to ""Canto Alla Vitta"" (tech-rock?). I wish I could say it gels. It doesn't. Of course this is just a prelude to the real reason why I will be returning this DVD to get my money back. Josh Groban's voice has a nasal sound! It's very definitely there, especially in the first few minutes of the concert. I hope the die-hard fans have deep pockets. I have a challenge for the following reviewer. Go to the store and buy MY copy! I definitely sound better than Josh Groban and I don't expect anyone to pay me to sing."
5,The town's battle becomes your battle..,Clay Reynolds does an excellent job of setting up the characters and making you feel like one of the town members in Monuments. You have a tendency of rushing through the pages in order to discover what Hugh must face next. You soon realize there is more to the book than a battle to save a landmark. This is a must read!!!
4,Bluegrass for Yankees,"I have lived in the North most of my life, but recently lived in Nashville, TN for a number a years. During that time I grew to appreciate bluegrass. OCMS is an excellent album, especially if you did not grow up listening to bluegrass. OCMS is bluegrass in the traditional sense, but it has a new generation feel to it. I found myself listening to this album over and over again, despite strange looks from the Yankee folks."
5,The Best of Whats Around,"This cd is an excellent choice for folk, bluegrass, and Americana music listeners. I thoroughly enjoy every song on the disc, which a rarity."
3,"The Monkees reunite, form stringband","And they can almost play those things now.Ok, they're kinda fun, it's true. But like Gillian Welch to Hazel Dickens, it's more mimicry than music.And also like Welch, for all the careful posing, there's a certain sterility to the whole package.Carefully off-key just enough in the appropriate places.It wears a little thin and feels a little hollow in the end.Almost all the right poses, just lacking a little genuine soul.Hey, maybe Will Oldham's got a little left over in an old fruit jar he can sell 'em."
5,Pigeon Creek Wailers,"If you're into that old bluegrass sounds with a modern twist, these are the guys to follow. The harmonizing melodies are amazing! Songs like Wagonwheel will knock you socks off! Look to see these guys become one of the best modern bluegrass bands since Watson, Stanley Bros, Scruggs etc..."
2,JUST A GLIMPSE OF JUDY GARLAND !,IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT THIS DVD ONLY SHOWCASES A TINY MUSICAL CLIP OF MISS JUDY GARLAND ... IT'S ACTUALLY PATHETIC TO PUT A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND IN THE SAME CATEGORY OF SIMON & GARFUNKEL !
4,Virginia Simpson grows up...,"This second book in Prairie Legacy is a continuation of the life of Virginia, granddaughter of Clark and Marty and daughter of Belinda and Drew.... of the Love Comes Softly series. Virginia is becoming an adult and her plans for college, marriage and friendship with Jenny are all challenged in this book, another great one by Janette Oke. The end leaves one reaching for book 3 of this series."
3,"ok, but...","I got these gloves for my husband - he is a goalie for the Las Vegas Knights as well as a goalie for three other teams here in LV NV. They fit well, but have not held up as we had hoped they would. They tore in the palm area first game they were worn. Very disappointing for me as they were a christmas present for him. I think they could be more durable for those goalies who play with real teams that play hard."
5,Bellydancing,I love this DVD. It made me sweat and gave me a great workout. I also had lots of fun. My only advice if you are a beginner I would get thur all of Rania's workout tapes first as this is very intermediate. If you are not familar with the moves from previous video''s then you would be lost. This is fast.
3,Too hip? Too complicated!,"The blurb on the front of the DVD says ""easy-to-follow."" Only if you are an experienced. If you are familar with basic bellydance moves and/or Rania's previous workouts you will do fine. However, this DVD is not for those new to bellydancing. There is no breakdown of the moves and all the moves are very fast. I also found the choreography awkward at times. However, this is finally a workout by Rania that actually got my heart rate up. It's a vast improvement over her previous ones that were just too slow paced."
1,The Great forest,"This book is the best I ever read.It tells about all the animals that live there.A short man wacks tree,all the animals are sad that their family will live without tree's."
3,the great kapok tree,"The Great Kapok Tree is about the rainforest. It starts when two men walked into a rain forest. The larger man pointed to a large kapok tree. Then he walked away. The smaller man then hold his heavy axe started to cut down the tree. Soon he became very tired and went into a deep sleep. But as he slept, the animals whose lives depended on the great kapok tree started to come down to the ground and started to quietly whisper in the man's ear, talking about how important the rainforest was. Later a rainforest boy comes and whisper in the man's year too, agreeing with the animals. Then the man wakes up and he was about to cut down the tree but then he stopped and he walked out the rainforest quietly.This book has a moral. Although this book has no suspense, it teaches us abut why trees are important and how to make good decisions. The illustrations are colorful as Jan Brett's. I would recommend to children 5-8 years old."
4,a reader in Colorado,"This book has a great story behind it. The personal account from the Pascucci's tell of the great town that Glenwood is, the history of the town and the very sadness of what can happen in a split of a second in someones lives. The grammar does need repaired but the story is the main thing in this book. I feel the Pascucci's did alot of research and put their personal experience in the proper way in this story."
2,Lose Fat Fast: Cardio Workout & Self-Hypnosis for Weight Loss,I love Tamilees stretching videos. I found the hypnosis nice. But the exerciseportion of the video was to hard to keep up.
5,Great Life-Changing book for everyone,"Few books really have an impact on our lives. After reading this one, however, I came to realize how the prisoner's dilemna and the ideas and real world examples of cooperation of this book apply to everything around us. I've applied these ideas to my work, my relationships, my game playing and they have clarified and strengthened all of thse areas. And truly, anyone can read this book. Don't be scared away by ""game-theory"" and ""prisoner's dilemna"" and ""math."" It sounds cheesy but I truly believe that if everyone read this book, the would be a better place. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,"Complete Junk, get the John Carpenter version with Kurt Russell","Don't waste your time on this dumbed down teen version of a great classic movie, the original Black & White version was a masterpiece but not for everyone as it is dated and most of the action is actually off screen as it was impossible to do the special effects in those days.The 80's remake by John Carpenter was a sci-fi masterpiece, acting, casting,special effects, brilliant music score, and next to the chest-burster scene in the first Alien movie probably some of the scariest & original scenes ever shot. Carpenter's script is much closer to the book too, Carpenter is a bit like James Cameron, he knows how to tell a really good story as well as scare the bejesus out of us at the same time.This version is dreck, it looks like they took the Stepford cast from a Macy's clothing sale catalogue, pretty, but dumb as rocks with dialalogue to match."
3,The same movie??,"I'm not really good at writing long and complicated analytical reviews so here's the quick breakdown. It's basically the original without the suspense and otherwise awesome cinematography. Several of the scenes seem to mimic the original movie. The guy getting burned while seated against the wall, testing to see who's infected while everybody in the room eye's everybody else suspiciously, etc. Sadly the original special effects are even better. You can't mess with John Carpenter. Still made my wife jump a few times though."
4,The Thing Begins!!!,"I saw this movie before seeing John Carpenter's The Thing. It was a lot better after watching it again. I loved the creature effects and gore scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty much the only reason I wanted to see this because I enjoy her movies and she's very pretty. Some scenes dragged, and others were suspenseful. I love how it leads right into the original. In 1982, a paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is asked by a Norwegian scientist named Sander to travel to Antarctica to uncover a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. They find a creature frozen in the ice, and bring it back to base. It soon thaws and becomes each member of the team and tries to escape. It's up to Kate to stop...THE THING!!!"
4,SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT BURIED,"This prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 classic remake of the 1951 original is much better than I expected. The movie is faithful to Carpenter's version and maintains its eerie atmospheric tension. A major disappointment is that some of the key scenes are filmed so dark, you miss what's going on. But the effects are well done and I like Marco Beltrami's haunting score.The cast is good, especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead's reluctant heroine, Joel Edgerton as the American pilot and Eric Christian Olsen's doleful lab assistant.While not as effective as Carpenter's masterpiece, this prequel is a very good horror movie and I recommend it. Perhaps a double feature would be fun!!!"
2,"The Third ""The Thing""","Forgive me, perhaps it's my age (over 50) or the fact that good acting makes a good movie. The Thing #1 ~ original done in 1951 was in black and white, had no special effects, great plot, acting was good and it all equalled a great movie ~ the one that gave James Arness the break he needed to get into the movie business (it was his first role).The Thing #2 was of course quite a bit different with the added special effects, Kurt Russell and a very feasible story line. A good movie.The Thing #3 left me with a feeling of ""OK - special effects were good, but acting? Could have been a lot better. Not one I would write home about..."
2,"This ""Thing"" is ""NO-THING""","I'm glad I didn't go to see this in the theatre, and I'm sorry I paid 3.99 on Amazon.com for it. Should have gone to my collection and watched the James Arness version, followed by the Kurt Russell(Carpenter)film.What this movie lacks in ""suspense."" Both of the earlier versions managed to keep you interested in the both the creature and the characters. And who didn't see the woman as the last one standing?What they had alot of was special effects, which became boring quickly. And finally, the ending, which is the beginning of Carpenter's version. Too bad. Sometimes prequels work. This one stands alone as a real muck up.I hope this version doesn't turn anyone off to seeing Kurt Russell's excellent acting, and if you want a real treat, get the original. It's a movie buff's joy to behold.Again this version of ""The Thing"" is ""NO-THING."""
2,not my thing,"female standin for kurt russell as lead is a waste of film...and this rendition is a rerun, not a prequel, until the last half hour or so...good fx, but like most sequels (which, for the most part, this is), has been overanalyzed, underwritten, and lacks spontaneity...ciao."
4,A classic remade,"Just your basic scary monster movie, a la 1950s. Our Heroine is recruited into an ill-defined Antarctic expedition, and they're off. They excavate The Thing from the ice and, despite thousands of years of age, it's not all that dead. Cue the paranoia, bring on the claustrophobia, and start the body count: one by one, the isolated scientists get picked off in increasingly gruesome ways.Well done, of its kind, it differs from most other flicks of this sort in that the polar temperatures mean everyone stays pretty well bundled up, so we never get the usual ""vulnerability"" scene of Our Heroine in her Haynes. Also, we never get clear explanation of why this peaceful little science outpost comes so well supplied with the military goodies used against The Thing. I'm not complaining, though. Kate (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) channels Sigourney Weaver's ""babe with flamethrower"" more than adequately. Fun to watch, but hardly one for the ages.- wiredweird"
5,My Type of Scary Movie,"I like the traditional scary movies that make my heart skip a beat. This is one of them. Although, I watched the original Thing. I don't mind a Thing 2, or 3 or 4. No dislikes. Will recommend."
2,"bunk,lame","Stick to the Kurt Russell version,this one is truely garbage at best,remakes rarely deliver and this one stays true to that ideal"
2,Great potential lost.,"The special effects were well done and scary but the problem I had was the fact that the ""alien"" was intelligent enough to carry on a conversation, and even operate a freakin spaceship, yet it continued to act more like a wild tiger hiding and hunting!W.T.F.?We are a smarter audience and we deserve better. This movie does have its ""entertainment"" value but there was a much more interesting story that could've came of this and we didn't get it! It seemed geared toward, shall we say, a teenage audience. This movie is a poor follow-up to the original (circa 1980's)."
2,Prequel (or Remake?) without the tension,"First I'll say the John Carpenter one was very enjoyable. You could feel the tension and distrust between everyone. This one felt forced. The tension was never really believable from anyone aside from Ms. Winsted. She made it better though the only tension was when the Thing was hunting people. Everyone else seemed to be going through the motions. Second, I wasn't sure if I was watching the JC version or a prequel. I thought it was supposed to be a prequel, but it felt like I was watching John's version. Everything seemed lifted: from the test to the wandering in the storm. They did try and alter the test but it all felt too familiar.I will say I loved the tie in at the end. That partially made the movie for me. Fit very nicely into John's version. Aside from that, this was a pretty mundane creature feature that would have been better served with another name."
3,oh tommy,"Lol okay so I saw the censored version on adult swim (please refer to Tim and Erik Season 4, episode labeled Tommy, for Adult Swim's logic in airing this)...actually I'm watching it right now and its ridiculous. As much as they try to pass this off as a dark comedy you can tell this film was meant to be in all seriousness, but the atrocious acting and ridiculous story makes this film a laughable entry in its own right. I am almost tempted to get the dvd merely for all the nudity from the random sex scenes that seem to occur every ten minutes accompanied by generic r&b music. I'm not going to provide a very in depth review, since as I mentioned I'm watching this as I am typing. I also see no real benefit in putting that much analysis into something that isn't quite merit of such attention...no offense Tommy. As I said, it is amusing, though also a little sad."
1,Do not be fooled by other reviews...,"This was the worst movie ever; at least over at TROMA they know they're making bad movies, and they celebrate bad movies... This guy was actually trying to make a touching film about love and betrayal, and this steaming pile is the result!"
4,7 days,"I watched this movie alone. Shortly after finishing, the phone rang and when I answered it and a little girl said ""7 days..."". I did the only sensible thing and passed it on to a friend. ""Oh, hi Mark."""
5,YOU'RE TEARING ME APART,"Best movie of all time.I've seen The Room online multiple times, but I needed a way to inflict this masterpiece on my friends and family while in the living room. So naturally I had to buy the DVD."
1,Life changing,"I now mark my life into two parts - life before and after The Room. After seeing The Room, things seem differently. Colors now have taste. Taste no longer exists. My ears are filled with Tommy Wiseau's ""Oh, hi there!""See The Room, and be transformed into another consciousness that never knows how people behave, or talk, or think. A fever dream in which situations arise and disappear without leaving a trace. Where leading men can look like shambling corpses a few weeks old. Where the meaning of roses and chocolates have become perverse symbols of love. Where perversion is normal, where normal is perversion.This is... The Room."
2,just can't polish a turd...,"talk about much ado about NOTHING! this stupid soap opera on film is a total waste of time. are there really so many people with such empty lives that need a piece of toe jam like this to cheer them up (I am speaking to the nerds who go see this at theaters across ""this great country of ours"")? this butt ugly film is a reflection of our pathetically hollow culture and not worth your time. trust me..."
2,A Friend Made Me Read This Book. We're No Longer Friends!,"I can't explain it. I've probably read close to 1,000 books in my life. And I've never found a book as difficult to complete as this one. (And I always finish a book once I've started it.) It's not that I disliked every element of the book. Some of the battle scenes were very well done. But I found the rest of the book to be a real struggle. Maybe I had a hard time rooting for ""the other side."" My friend was very disappointed because this is one of his favorite novels. I know that he would give it 5 stars."
1,AMZN Fakers too,"Bad enough, newbie fans had to deal with knock off Bruce Lee arttists (Bruce Li, Bruce Le, Dragon Lee and so on...)Don't list Bruce Le with the real Brruce Lee... Worse yet you titled it LEE when the cover SAYS LE!"
5,the king of chefs lives on!!,"he is the king of chefs and the chef of kings, enough said. I would say for anyone that has more then a little knowledge about food and terms then you'll be fine, other wise you might have to do a little homework, but even then this is a great book and do not let that scare you. great chef, great book, in my eyes it is a def must have for a chef of any degree!!"
5,One of the best cookbooks ever,"Not much can be said about this book, it is pretty self-exclamatory. Even years after his death Auguste Escoffier is still The authority on French gastronomy. Basically if you want to learn to cook extremely well this is the right book. It is not just a bunch of recipes, it is a lot of technique as well. If you have a little determination and some spare time and if you learn the techniques and follow the recipes, there is no doubt you will be a great well rounded cook."
4,Good Read,I enjoy all of Mr. Rogers' works. The main reason I did not give it a 5 star really had nothing to do with his views. This book contained many of the ignorant views of others that he used to show us the attitudes of the so called learned. I highly recommend.
3,Good novel damaged by scanning defects,"Although the novel was a good read, I was often frustrated by what appeared to be typographical errors. I believe these were due to a lack of quality proof-reading of the product of an electronic scan of printed pages. For example, the word ""die"" was repeatedly scanned as ""the."" It took a couple of occurrences to figure this one out. Also, periods went missing, quotation marks reversed, etc. Sometimes the error was obvious, but sometimes frustratingly obscure. Poor execution damaged a potentially good product."
4,Cold War classic,"Cold War thrillers really belong in a class by themselves. They freeze in amber an era of bipolarity, good vs. evil, the razor's edge of annihilation. The world was comfortably Manichean.So this is a great throwback novel, with throwback themes like U.S. vs. U.S.S.R., Cold War chicanery, moles, spies and leftover Nazis. The plot--why did someone trick Michael Havelock into thinking his girlfriend betrayed him? -- leads to a strange twist about the world teetering on the edge of chaos because one man decided to prove that another man had too much power. Fun, but farfetched. But that's the Cold War thriller for you."
5,This one & Matarese Circle are both No. 1 must read!!!,"Funny there is no comments on this one and not so many on Matarese Circle. But believe me, both were the most mature and perfect ones when Ludlum was still at his prime time. I think once you start reading these two books, there would be a lot of sleepless nights afterwards. I knew it, because not only I read them once, I also have translated them into another language word by word with no boring regrets at all! Read it, gentle readers, otherwise, you'd lose some most precious moments in your life"
5,Makes Papyrus Interesting!,"Thiede makes a potentially dry subject interesting. His discussion of ancient writing scripts is reserved but forceful. In short a must read for those interested in the New Testament.My favorite chapter was the fourth. Its summary of Huleatt, the Victorian missionary and scholar, gives us a small window of life in the last half of the 19th century.This book is a good counterpoint for those who claim that the Gospels were written long after Christ died."
4,Very nice addition to the pocket hole arsenal,This bench clamp's base is made from heavy zinc plated steel. The hefty weight of the base adds to the stability when it is used. The clamp is mounted to the base from the bottom by a large screw. The adjustable is well-made and exert ample pressure to the intersecting two pieces of wood. This clamp works best if mounted to a larger board (MDF would be perfect). The board should be routed with a recess so the base will sit flush with the board surface. Drill a hole at the center so you can have access to the mounting screws after the base is mounted. This Bench Klamp makes drilling pocket holes much easier.
4,Seems like a quality pack,"This pack didn't fit my dog. I ordered the medium because she has a 28"" girth and weighs 60 lb. However, she is a pretty compact, muscular dog, and this pack was too small. The chest strap was way too long and is unadjustable. I ordered a new pack from a different company. I don't like that there is only one belly strap on this one, but I couldn't tell how well it actually works. If it actually fit my dog, it may have been a very good pack, and seems to be well-constructed."
4,"somewhere between Sandy Denny, Elliot Smith, and Lucinda","if the new breed of singer/songwriters is your thing like Elliot Smith and/or you dig the classic sounds of Sandy Denny and/or Lucinda Williams - you'll probably like Sonya Hunter. She straddles the line between ""indie-modern"" and ""classic"" folk rock. At times Sonya is sort of old school singer/songwriter with lush harmonies, some interesting string or horn arrangements(always lightly done, not over-produced), other times, she's more stripped down and straight forward - just a girl and guitar.This is her newest CD, she's been around for awhile, was on Heyday Records in the early 90's along with Barbara Manning and Penelope Houston - and if either of those names means something to you - you'll probably find Sonya's sound somewhere inbetween Manning's moody indie-rock vibe and Houston's bright acoustic folk pop."
1,Silver hardware. Dumb,I bought this black product and the hood catches were black but the hardware was Stainless silver. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Keep this in mind.
3,Almost...,"I ordered these for my step-dad's 1983 CJ5 for christmas. I receieved them realtivally fast, about 4 business days. The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because by the picture and description it says ""stainless steel."" The hood catches I received were black. I'm bummed, but it's too close to christmas to return them for stainless steel ones. Over all good delivery, but poor product description."
5,Amazing book,This book includes everything you want to know about Eva. I really suggest this to everyone. Its a book for life..
1,Sizes incorrect,"I bought 5 shirts and ordered all XL size. Two looked about the size of medium and the other three were the size of large (none fit)and yet all 5 had the XL tag in the back. I ordered 5 more shirts from another manufacturer and the xl sizes fit perfectly. Buyer beware of the sizes when you order, they are not common sizes and you will have to pay shipping costs to return them."
3,Pat's opinion,This DVD player is ok. I bought it for playing CDs at work and out of the package it had a dirty laser. I use a Yamaha 5 disc dvd at home and it has never skiped on anything. I guess you get what you pay for. I cleaned it out with compressed air and it seems to be working ok now.All in all I would recommend it at as cheap simple solution but not for any nice system you might hope to put together.
4,good quality for the money,"It's a good piece of machine for the money, but not much more than that. Remote control has the most basic functions. It is pretty loud when searching for the tracks. The RCA cable is really crappy, which generates a lot of color distortions. After I replaced the one given in the box with the one from my old (and dead) DVD player, the colors seem decent now."
1,garbage - don't buy,Remote broke after 6 weeks. Player stopped working after 8 weeks. Philips will replace unit under warranty only if I pay to ship it back. A useless product and warranty.
3,So far so good,"bought this for my dad's christmas gift , pretty basic nothing too fancy as my dad is a simple kind of man , seems to work just fine , great price too ,"
3,Not Bad,"Does the job. I've only used it a couple of times so far. One day it did ""stick"" -- didn't seem to want to work but I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was fine. I actually didn't even want this brand. I SOMEHOW, accidently, ordered the wrong one. I actually think it was Amazon's fault but not sure on that. Anyway, I attempted to send it back and get what I wanted but I didn't get a response and so just let it go. Wasn't really worth sending back for what I paid for it."
3,Good DVD player for the money,"3 stars for 3 Pros:1. Great audio and video quality2. Plays everything and can be region free easily3. Cheap2 stars missing for 2 Cons:1. Problem with scratched discs which can be read by my other players2. Bad compatibility with cheap CDRs, e.g. Optimum brand"
4,pimpbot- a great new band,i have seen this band play live 3 times in Hawaii. after one of their shows a friend of mine purchased their cd. We couldnt stop listening to it. Its definetly one of the best cds from a virtually unknown band I have heard since getting a hold of a blink 182 demo in 1993. Their catchy lyrics and upbeat ska tunes will make you wanna get out of your seat and start dancing. The pimpbots are alot of fun. I recommend this album to anyone.
2,Pyrethrin is NOT main ingredient,"I'm sure the product does it's job and for that I gave it two stars, but I was looking for pyrethrin alone, without all the added other pesticides, and this product only has 0.97% pyrethrin in it. Less than a single percentage. Very disappointed that fact wasn't made clear as the name of it implies that it's the main ingredient, and you can't read it from the picture."
5,"Gripping, Insightful","The bio said Robert Imrie lived in Japan for over 15 years and married to a Japanese pianist. So, there is no surprise about his intimate knowledge of the country of Rising Sun - its culture, traditions, social norms, intricate human relations. But this book goes beyond a standard cross-cultural novel - the story is gripping, insightful. A real page tuner. Highly recommended."
3,the education of a coach,"The author has written better books. I had a hard time getting into this book, due to too much detail in the first half of the book. Possibly it was just my attitude. This is an excellent writer, who always presents a clear and truthful picture,."
3,Not enough Pats Super Bowl material,"As an avid Pats fan, I was hoping to learn more about the comraderie and strategy of Coach BB and his Pats organization, including Mr. Kraft. Instead, there are alot of pages devoted to Bill as he grows up the son of a coach, his days in college, his relationship with Parcells, and the debacle he went through in Cleveland. His Croatian roots & work ethic shine through, as does his supreme preparation and confabbing with Ernie Adams, his longtime friend & adviser. Still, it leaves a fan wanting to know more about the many personalities & difficulties worked through when NE won 3 out of 4 Super Bowls."
2,Overall a very boring book,"The first half of the books reads like Genesis. The book starts out with Belichick's father and takes us through every job he ever had and introduces us to every other coach or scout he worked with or knew. The process is then repeated with Bill himself. Once all the begats are over, the author finally starts to talk about Belichick's ideas and philosophies. Here is where the author really misses. He doesn't convey or even seem to understand what makes Belichick an exceptional coach."
1,Puff Piece,"I hate to pile on a fine author when the time has passed when he can redeem himself but I concur with all the negative reviews with one exception--I don't think the book's lack of appeal can be written off as due to the fact that Belichik is a boring oaf. He is that on the outside, but there's a lot more than that inside and the author just did not dig that out. The problem with the book is that there is minimal ""inside"" information - a little more detail about Tom Brady's development than maybe you know, and a good explanation of just how feared a player Marshall Faulk was, but that's about it. The title suggests that the subject matter is limited to the sort of background biographical stuff so maybe we should have seen this coming, but this is really little more than an expansion of the bio you might find on the Patriots website."
5,"Great for Heat too, get 2, 1 in use, 1 in wash.","I bought 1 for my Service Dog for when she is in heat, I buy Feminine Hygiene pads (Poise) & use them with this bladder control garment for doggy heat & it works like a charm, only problem was that when it was in the wash my doggy had to be locked in the bathroom until the laundry was done so I bought an extra. The only Con is the sewing does not hold up well with repeated washing's & Velcro is cheap & wears out after about 6 to 9 months but I can sew & its not a problem & I plan to buy more."
1,Terribly Disappointed!,"What a rip off. I bought the Infinity Upright Vacuum Cleaner with Pet Care System about six months ago. No problems at all for the first 2 months, but about a month later my husband had to take the Infinity to the repair stop to have it unclogged. Did I mention that only the sleeping quarters of the home has carpeting, and that we have no pets? So what's with the Infinity clogging so fast? What a waste of my money and a total disappointment. I guess it just goes to show you that you can't judge a book by it's pretty little cover now can you? Again, a waste of money and a waste of time!"
1,"Beware, great at first!!!","I purchased the Infinity ahnd thought it was a fantastic vacuum. It sucked up dirt better than my Hoover Windtunnel. After using it a couple of times, I noticed the red light blinking. I emptied the dust collector. I then vacuumed my living room, which is an average size and the red light came on again. This happened several times after I emptied it. So I washed out the cylinders, which requires patience and effort. I was only able to vacuum my living room and small hallway and again the red light. Conclusion: You don't get to vacuum much before you have to clean the cylinders. In about four months the suction decreased. I am guessing that dirt collected somewhere else. Ten months after purchasing this vacuum, the handle where you push and pull the vacuum broke. It is unusable unless I somehow tape it together. I decided to end this nightmare and I purchased another Hoover vacuum today. DO NOT BUY AN INFINITY unless you don't mind wasting your money."
1,"frustrating, troublesome, waste of effort, time, money","After one year, our Infinity is headed to freecycle. Problems: it clogs on a regular basis, pet hair tool lacks power and suction to be of use, requires frequent cleaning, not easy to put back together after cleaning. After the expense of two professional service visits, I'm tired of wasting my time on this product."
1,Poor Design,"This product is poorly designed. First it tips over very easily. Second, you constantly run the vacuum over the cord. Third, it has a very small capacity for dirt. Fourth, you have to use your hands to reach in and take out the dog hair and carpet dirt. So what is save with the HEPA filter is lost when you empty it. Not good for alergies. So it is overrated and over priced."
2,Doesn't suck... really.,"I'm really suprised by the comments that this has good suction. We've had it about 20 minutes now and I've found I can suck harder thru a straw than this unit.I have to litterally play with a small piece of dirt to get it to pick it up. So after about 30 seconds of playing with a speck of dirt, I get to move on to the next one.It just absolutely does not pick up by just normal vacuum motions.Our old vac was 3 times the vac before it died.We're taking it back to the store right now."
2,Danger! Read reviews,"Please! DO NOT take a chance on ANY Shark product.Taking my 250.00 + Infinity out to the trash today...less that 3 yo.Here is the bottom line!Yes...all Vacuum's are cheap, made of plastic and made in China...But here is the problem with Shark product's.There is NO customer service and NO parts available to repair broken a Shark!If you need a belt or light bulb, you might find it.ANY other item...your done.Go to the website and search for parts. Google Shark and search for parts.Call 1*888*866*9600 in New York ( an operating LLC for them ) and try to find replacement parts.The design and ""info-mercials"" are great....but when you need a part...it's over.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
4,Great info on ancient Rome,"This book gives a very detailed description of Roman society in the last century B. C. E. The book starts with a tour of the city, and then has chapters on business, education, slavery, holidays and much more. The table of contents tells exactly what is in each chapter, but it isn't active, and footnotes are at the end of the book. Most of the book is about the upper class because, as the author says, there just wasn't much written about the lower classes at the time, so not much is known. It doesn't say when the book was written, but going by the author's dates it must be from the late 19th or early 20th century."
4,Did anyone notice the reference to a tsuanami in 05??,"Ok this book was good and moved along nicely compared to 2001, but failed to deliver a stunning or even remotely good ending.The word play was much better than his previos novel, and grabbed my attention from the first.But the main thing I saw was his almost prophetic one line reference to a Tsunamui in 2005. I read this book shortly after the real Tsunami in Sri Lanka, and was totally taken aback and thought to myself,""Holy cow! What are the odds of Clarke saying a Tsunami in the year 2005, when he wrote the book in 1982?"" He even wrote this book in Sri Lanka, were the blunt of the wave hit.So anyway if you want to read a gripping science fiction novel, this is the one for you. Also this book is for anyone wanting to be completely freaked by the similarities between the novel and real life."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Post Discovery mission.Several years after Bowman and company's original mission failure a new expedition is undertaken - this time to Jupiter, not to Saturn as in the previous novel, so following on from the film plot instead. It is a joint country mission as it is the Russians that have developed more advanced travel technology, the Chinese too it is discovered.What follows is more of Bowman and the aliens and what they are trying to achieve.Just an ok book, really."
4,"As good, if not better than 2001","2010 has a very detailed plot with many suprising twists and turns. Many times during the book, which I've read twice, I was amased by how unpredictable it was. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
4,An Excellent Sequel,"I am just getting around to reading this classic series and I have to say that I cannot help but wonder what took me so long. This story takes place 9 years after the movie adaptation and answers many of the questions that were unanswered in the first book. Since the first book was an adaptation. I thought the next one would be written in a very different style. This was not the case at all. While Clarke's writing style is simple and straightforward, the ideas contained in his books are big indeed! Done in the hard Sci-fi style 2010 tell the story of man's first contact with intelligent life. Many fundamental questions such as the nature of consciousness the ultimate fate of mankind and the purpose of life are raised in a way that is both plausible and easy to relate to. This is a great sequel and I look forward to reading the next one."
4,A Second Odyssey Through the Stars,"The first sequel to Clarke's stunning Space Odyssey series, 2010 takes us on a second journey to the distant Solar worlds. In a retroactive change, instead of Saturn, Discovery One is now floating around Jupiter.Floyd, from the first book, as well as Chandra and several soviet cosmonauts, set off on a journey to Jupiter to investigate what happened to Bowman when his transmissions ceased.It is here that they discover more than just an abandoned space ship. They discover an event that will change the Solar system as they know it.This book brings more insight into the Star Child, as well as a glimpse into extra terrestrial intelligence. Clark is able to write convincing characters dealing with plausible science problems, and his books never cease to be entertaining.I recommend this book to you if you enjoyed the first one, 2001: A Space Odyssey."
4,"""Intriguing, mystefying, out of this world""","Arthur C. Clark presents a thrilling grasp of the infinate in this timeless novel. He combines imagination and science to create a dazzling display of time and space's eternal mysteries. He takes you on a journey from the remote past to the near future, and touches on that fragile subject- is there life on other worlds? From the firey fury of Io to the frozen ice of Europa, from the fragile wisps of gaseous creatures in the atmosphere of Jupiter down to its diamond core, Arthur C. Clark shows the dazzling splendor of what might be. I encourage you to read this book, especially if you have read 2001. 2010 prompted me to look up at the stars and think- ""What is really out there?"""
3,Not for embroidery machines!,"Caution - this book is NOT what it may appear to be! It was written almost 20 years ago, and deals with using a SEWING machine and a variety of zig-zag stitching to achieve embroidery-type results. It is NOT about using embroidery machines. As an embroidery machine enthusiast, it was of little value to me."
3,Its not a story but more like an animal list,"My 3-year didn't care for the book that much but it's OK. I think the art is nice but not detailed enough for my son. It was not quite what I expected, that is, a multi-page story. It's more like a group of animal flash cards put together in a book."
3,Solid Release,"Well what can be said about Dark Funeral's newest release? Overall it is quite good. The production is excellent, as are the vocals and all of the songs are very good and entertaining. The english on the lyrics is a bit akward though, but really how many of us really care what black metal lyrics are about anyway? Is this a mandatory release? No, but a worthwhile one nonetheless. I recommend getting it used unless you are a Dark Funeral fanatic and just have to have it. But if that is the case you don't need this review to tell you that do you? Best tracks are King Antichrist and 666 Voices Inside."
1,"awful sound! AVOID this release, buy the SPALAX one instead!!!","This is a frankly awful, murky and muddy mix of this otherwise classic album. Avoid it! Buy the French Spalax release instead, it has better sound!!!"
3,Lame!,My niece has had these before. These are pretty disappointing. On the commercial these was shown to change back to the original color very quickly but in real life it can take about five minutes. These are also not durable. A lot of hers broke off a little piece that held the cap on so I think they died out really fast. She did enjoy the hidden objects coloring sheet however she could tell what most of the hidden stuff was before coloring.
5,a story to read to y our child each December,a wonderfu story with beautiful illustrations by Tomie DePaola. Share it with your children. you will both enjoy it!Feilz Navidad!
5,the night of los posadas,If you have never read any of this authors work run not walk to your computer and order these wonderful books from Amazon. All of his stories will leave your heart lighter and a beautiful tear in your eye. My personal favorite is the Clown of God.
4,Elizabeth Elgin's Magic Continues,"""Whisper on the Wind"" by Elizbeth Elgin is a great book that is set during war-time Britian. It tells the story about how a war change the lives of everyone. I really enjoy the fact that Ms. Elgin makes the reader feel like they are part of the action. Truly a great book!"
5,"Bought in 2005, still haven't replaced","5 years old and counting, still a great monitor. Haven't seen a need to replace it yet. Never had a single issue, this monitor was also made before companies started the 60hz - 120hz battle. That was really just lies to get you to buy a new tv. This thing doesn't slow down or show choppy video's one bit."
3,Sextet Session In The Box,"I havn't heard this yet so I can't commit myself one way or the other. It is included in the recently realeased Mosaic 7CD Box set of Mingus Live recordings. I've seen a very good product description of it. It's Johnny Coles, Clifford Jordan and Eric Dolphy Live at Town Hall and Amsterdam on the first 4 CDs with no overlap and on the other 3 it's Lonnie Hillyer, Charles Mc Pherson and on this Monterey concert John Handy on tenor sax is also in the group."
5,A Classic,"In some ways this is one of my favorite movies. It's a subtle comedy but it is a classic in it's own right. Alec Guinness, as always, does a great job portraying George Bird. If you like British comedies of the 1950s then you might like this one."
2,Don Williams The Definitive Collection,"The songs are wonderful. The CD, straight out of the plastic wrapping, had numerous skips and problems. It was a great disappointment to get a poor quality CD from such a genius music maker. If the technical difficulties were not there, the CD would have been a great buy and I would have been ecstatic."
1,Here's my problem!,"Don't get me wrong, the material here is great! It's the production I have a problem with. Don Williams had a number of great years with MCA. Why repeat everything, or most of everything on a single disk? All these cuts were available on both ""Anthology"" and ""Gold"". I'd much rather he rerelease, or his management, or whomever; ""Portrait"", ""Listen to the Radio"", and ""Yellow Moon"" in their entirety."
4,great movie but!,"This is a great gangster movie that WB were the best at making, BUT!kKnow matter how good, the public really wanted to see Cagney as the gangsterand rightfully so,says something about Americans.I love Ann Dvorak's classic line when she is dieing,"" I won't be around"".The only improvement would have been Bogart playing the Barton MaClaine part"
4,Historic Cagney Vehicle,"James Cagney blazes the screen in this contrived yet entertaining crime thriller from the Warner Bros. assembly line. ""G Men"" finds the movie tough guy joining the FBI to avenge a friend's cold-blooded murder, with plenty of chases and shootouts along the way. Cagney's charismatic energy and William Keighley's crisp direction overcome a predictable script. Good support from Robert Armstrong, Lloyd Nolan and the underrated Ann Dvorak. No masterpiece, but historically important for its Production Code shift from iconic gangsters to crime-fighting heroes."
4,"""Only six states. We've got them cornered!""","When the production code came around, movies got cleaned up, and that included gangster movies. In consequence, gangsters could not be glorified, so James Cagney went from hoodlum to the side of the law in G-Men. This is the story of the beginning of the FBI. Cagney plays Brick Davis, a former lawyer who turns to police work after his friend (Lloyd Nolan) is murdered in the line of duty. Brick grew up in the slums and was given his break by a gangster so he knows how the underworld works. That makes him a great cop. It is up to him to round up the top ten most wanted men in America and with the help of menotor Jeff McCord (Robert Armstrong), he can do it.An entertaining movie, G-Men is nothing too significant. It seems more like a Warners programmer than anything with plenty of stock actors. Ann Dvorak appears as a gangster's wife, Margaret Lindsay as Cagney's love interest, and Barton MacLane as the most elusive gangster Collins."
1,If you want to find automatic doors...,"If you want to find automatic doors and automatic doors only, please buy this product. I got my radar detector today and decided to give it a test tonight, and well besides finding every store with doors I didn't have to touch, it found itself right on my list of worthless plastic. I took it through some country towns and some interstate and when I saw some speed traps, i didn't even get a blip on the machine. Then, on my return trip, I set my cruise to about 13 over to get myself home, watching the detector and praying for one little flash or beep, but magically the highy patrol lights filled the background of my car, and the radar DETECTOR did not even DETECT the RADAR when it was parked 10 FEET behind me. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money."
4,Good value for the money,"Purchased for alerting me to laser and radar use by law enforcement. There are some false alarms but usually not severe. Has been very effective with alerting me about speed traps over hills and around bends. Knock on wood, no tickets since the purchase. It has been well worth the price paid."
4,Super Pet CritterTrail Lazy Look-Out Accessory Kit,"My son's hamster loves nesting in his new look-out which is now his favorite hangout. However, one has to make sure the lid is securely fastened because I thought I had closed it tightly and later discovered it was not latched completely. Needless to say, the hamster used this opportunity to escape and was busy exploring the house until we found him."
1,Dont buy this!!!,My hamster died because of this!!! he was trying to get down from the tube and he fell head first down the tube and hit his head and died!DONT buy this unless you want your hamster to die.
4,Great CT expansion for the price.,"I bought this as an add on for the Critter trail primary habbitat. I used it to plug the hole where the water bottle originally went. I did not use all three sections of tube, I only used the ""j"" tube and the blue tube. The red tube, I used as a link from the Critter trail Primary habitat, to the Critter trail one level habitat. It worked out great that way, and saved me from having to buy a single piece of tube for 4.00 to connect the two cages.As far as the product itself goes, it is stable and the lid attaches very securely all the way around. My hamster loved to go up there and curl up and sleep....he never brought any bedding up there, so I did it for him....then he refused to go up there...so I removed the bedding....and now he likes to go up there and curl up and sleep... It is his home, so I guess if thats the way he wants it, and if he is happy, then I am happy!"
5,Going Up!!!!,"Let me start off by saying that yes, you need to make sure your habitat is structured to support this. We do NOT find that is top heavy. Our hamster likes to take his food up in the look-out tower to snack on. He hangs out in there and checks out the scene! We have had great luck and enjoyed this attachment."
3,"NOT the best U2 album, by far...","Right off the bat: the first five songs are amazing, then the album falls over, only recovering with ""Mothers Of The Disappeared"". It's still a very good album, but it just seems like it's a detour on the route of sonic exploration that began with 'The Unforgettable Fire' and resumed with 'Achtung Baby'. I appreciate the album because it does have six great songs on it (which is six more than most albums by most other bands), and its monstrous commercial success did give U2 the freedom to explore new sonic territory in the 1990s, but I will never agree that it's their ""best""."
2,tripe,"An overrated adult/contemporary schlock-fest pretending to be alternative, the Joshua Tree is as one-dimensional as the rest of U2's catalogue. I have never found Bono a particularly soulful singer, and his lyrics are like the scribblings of a 10th grader who just learned to rhyme. Put me in prison and force me to hear this stuff, I would lose my mind. There was better music than this in 1987 (try Pixies). (Interestingly, this was the same year REM sold out with Document). Bono is not the Bob Dylan of his generation, nor even any sort of a poet at all."
1,pretty boring album,"yup...although most people attribute this being their best work, it is probably the most boring...the lyrics are as bad as Tori Amos and the sound quality is worse Dokken.Steer clear from this rusty, over-hyped album."
1,What do people see in these guys?,"Ya know, i don't get it. What do people see in this band of garralous babbling morons? sure there albums reflect the politics of blah blah blah, but the music is so repetitive and dull, it puts me into a hypnotic trans which probably everyone else has been droned into. Bono and his gang are severly overatted and dull to the ear. Not to mention that there hit singles ""still haven't found what i'm looking for"" and ""In the name of love"" sound exactly the same. If I write anymore I'll get a headache thinking about why these guys are so popular"
5,Joshua Tree--better than ever!,"This album has always been one of my all-time favorites, but the sound on this latest remastered edition knocked my socks off. The DVD of a long ago concert is fun--better-than-expected video of the oh-so-young boys running through the numbers; reminded me of why they got my attention from their earliest songs!"
2,Overrated,"I never understood the acclaim this album received. It isn't a bad album; just inferior to all of U2's previous work and most of their later work.U2 deserves a great deal of credit for their passionate songwriting, and for developing a unique sound and then evolving in new directions. This cd is at the mid-point: it has the pure early sound, for the most part, but does nothing new with it. The songs have a sameness, and run together.I suppose the critics note that this album was a shift from the political to the personal, if not an evolution in other ways. But U2 had done songs on the personal level before, and done them much better. Listen to ""Bad"" on Unforgettable Fire. That single song contains twice the passion of this entire album.The following are better U2 cds: War, The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby, Zooropa, October, and Boy. The Joshua Tree, I suppose, is better than Rattle and Hum and Pop. It rates pretty low in the scale of ""must have"" U2 cds."
1,Too commercial.,"The beginning of the end for U2. This release marks their decent into selling out. If you want a real U2 cd, go get Boy or War, youll thank me later."
5,An impeccable Album that is as spirtually powerful as any,"Simply the greatest album of all time, nothing compares to this master piece from the energetic, revalating guitar chords on Where the streets have no name, to the emotional cry of bono voice in Mothers of the dissappered. There's no ablum that fits togethers and seizes the energy and love of the heart, and the profound purity of the soul. The album has everything a u2 or any true music fan could hope for, simply great, just like U2!"
5,Cuts Deep,What can you say - this release cuts deep! Dealing with the human condition and the hunger of the soul always does! A timeless and classic release from U2 - very moving! A canon in my music library!
5,Simply The Best,"I have been listening to U2 since in the womb, and the Joshua Tree album is simply the best of U2, in the raw!"
5,Best Album of the 80's,"There's no question that this is THE BEST ALBUM of the 80's. It's been 13 years from the first time I heard this record (in audio cassette by that time), and I still enjoy the songs today like in 1987. With Or Without You is also THE BEST SINGLE OF THE 80's.You must own this CD (I recommend the gold version from MFSL, also available at Amazon)."
5,Awesome sound. Great for the Video alone,"I am somewhat hesitant about writing a review for this cd, because to me, this is when U2 went BIG TIME, and they weren't the small Irish band anymore that people like me loved. Their first 4 cd's all had that distinct sound and this started to vary away from that sound.After buying this version, I was reminded of how great this album truly is. I would put this up there with the top 100 albums of all time ( along with the first four ). The sound is clearer and the video alone,( the real reason I bought this version ), are incredible.Remasters are usually a marketing ploy as far as I am concerned, with people not hearing much if any differance. The new Genesis remasters areASTOUNDING, and I put this with them. A differance you can hear!!!!I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of U2 and their early works.check out the upcoming remasters of the first three U2 cd's and you will be pleasently surprised, as I am sure I will."
4,Men in the desert.,"You can't help but see a mountain men, desert image when looking at pictures of U2 from the Joshua Tree era. The album cover, as well as some of the songs just put you in this frame of mind. It's certainly a far cry from the image of leather and shades and sexuality that would be adopted years later.No matter how many people sing the praises of The Joshua Tree, there are some songs that just don't do it for me. One Tree Hill and Mothers of the Disappeared are not really good to me. And I never had an orgasmic experience listening to Where the Streets Have No Name despite it being one of U2's legendary songs. The rest are great; and provide evidence as to why this album has the reputation it does.Sidenote: Somebody desperately needs to remaster U2's older albums. The sound quality is terrible."
5,The BEST U2 album ever,"This is really one of the finest piece of music my ears had ever listen to.Since the first album, U2 made even better and better music.Unfortunately, after ""The Joshua Tree"" U2 went DOWN and almost all the rest music they made after this album is even not worth of mention it. Sad thing what fame and money made from one of the finest bands.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO BUY AND LISTEN TO!"
3,not u2's best,"First of all I'm going to start by saying that I'm a huge U2 fan. I love the albums boy, war, achtung baby, and the unforgettable fire, but for some reason I just fail to see what's so great about Joshua tree. I love the first four songs though. The album opening with where the streets have no name is truly fantastic and one of the best album openings of all time. Other then this however I miss the appeal. After bullet the blue sky the rest of the album seems very mediocre by U2 standards. So my opinion about the reason why this album is so popular is because the first three songs are three of the greatest songs of all time. Those three songs are the only reason why I listen to this album, but three great songs can't make an album great. In fact an album could be great without any great songs. So in conclusion the Joshua tree is one of the most overrated albums ever. It's sad for me to say this about one of my favorite bands."
1,"an SACD would be a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"", this is laughable","I just don't understand why record companies release CD after CD calling them new and improved. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact that it's still low-resolution, old, 16 bit/44.1kHz technology. Even if it's remaster in DSD, what comes from your player is STILL low-resolution 16 bit/44.1kHz.CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it or WHO does the mastering/mixing.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery, or Rush's Moving Pictures (on Blu-Ray and also DVD-Audio). They're phenomenal and a TRUE ""Deluxe Editions"".Until the music companies get onboard and learn about audio, this is what we will see more of, trash recordings dressed up in fancy packaging then laughingly called ""Deluxe Editions""."
2,2007 Remaster Sounds Awful,"I haven't heard the original master of The Joshua Tree on CD, but I just bought the 2007 remaster and it sounds absolutely awful. The high end is completely gone...where on earth did it go? I hope the mixes weren't actually this bad."
5,Don't even bother listening to any newer U2 albums.,"U2 hasn't made a good album since this. Can you say ""Sell out"""
2,What was the fuss all about.?,"I know there were a zillion copies of this album sold over the years, but I just can't get into it. I like the first 3 tracks (which were all hits) but the rest of the album leaves me cold. That leaves me in the minority I'm sure but c'est la vie."
5,An Excellent Resource for the serious Jazz Musician,"This book, as are all of the Bert Ligon Jazz Books, is extremely well written. It provides great insight and detail into the components that make up Jazz theory, with practical examples taken from many of the greatest Jazz musicians of the past 60+ years. There are more than 250 examples with which to enhance your playing skills, and it has provided many more sounds and textures for me to choose from in my Jazz improvizational pallet. Study from this book, along with the Jazz Theory Resources vols 1 & 2 books, and you will be well on your way to being a much more versatile Jazz player."
1,Deceptive Picture of Product,Picture of Advertised Product is deceptive as it is not a true picture of the Lovejet for Shower (it is a picture of the original Lovejet for attaching to a faucet and not to a shower).
1,BlueAnt X3,This headset is very heavy and cannot be used without the earhook-but the earhook is enormous and causes the BlueAnt to just flap in the wind. The sound was good though.
2,Not as good as it looks,"The earpiece does not stay in my ear at all (guess I have small ears). I have to use the extra piece that goes over your ear, which gets my hair caught in it.The sound quality is ok, but when you answer a call with the headset or transfer a call to it, the person on the other end hears a loud squeal.I also thought the USB charger would have the small USB connection, but instead it has a unique plug on one end and USB on the other.I will be looking for something new."
2,Difficulties with Current Operating Systems,"My 5-year-old son plays this game in kindergarten, and he asked me to buy one for home too. The game itself is fun for him, but we have had a lot of trouble with its functioning on our computers. I have a the new Mac OS, and my husband's PC is a few years old... The game does not work at all on my computer, and shuts down frequently on his. I think MMH needs an update for newer operating systems!"
3,the best book on the subject,"Prof. Horio's book is the best work to understand the ""making of the modern Japanese"". It helped me immensily to read it when , in 1985 I arrived in Japan as the correspondent of Der Spiegel.The translation of Mr. Platzer is excellent for not only he knows very well Japanese, but he has his own insight into the country psyche: an unconventional, unortodox, unusual, but nevertheless VERY stimulating insight.Mr. Platzer is working on his own book about the ""making of the modern Japanese"" and that will be intereresting reading once it appears.For the time being: high compliments to Prof. Horio and to his, now deceased, unparalleled master and guide, Prof.Maruyama.tiziano terzani"
5,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"I am amazed why this was so controversial as ""obscenity"" fifty years ago.Truth is the ""sex"" is only a necessary inclusion and real issue was ""class contradiction"" between ruling class and working class.D. H. Lawrence described the sentiment in early 1900 England superbly, sensibly, and delicately.After all, this is the masterpiece of the classic literature. Kyo"
4,New Shins Album!,"This is a really very solid album....with some very good songs....but I don't know that any of the songs are like...amazing, they way ""New Slang"" was. I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Worth buying."
5,The best album by a great band!,"I can't say enough about this album. I've been listening to it nonstop over the past month and it seems to get better with every consecutive listen. I bought it on Vinyl as well as I'm a bog vinyl junky. The lyrics are sophisticated. The production is stellar. The music is upbeat and yet very soothing. It's a ten. Across the board one of the best albums of the year in my opinion. I can't say enough. I have ""liked"" past Shins albums, however, this album is a little different. Overall, it seems the arrangement of the songs is more dynamic. It seemed to me on past Shins albums that some of the songs were a bit mundane and lacked real punch. Here the songwriting really stands out. This album is, in other words, ""well crafted"". I can't say enough good things about this."
5,Word Salads,"Hey, I am a newcomer to the Shins. Please be patient with me here. Their lyrics are cryptic, and all over the pyscho map. The words remind me of tossed salads, or the kind of stuff you find text messaged on your cell phone from strangers. However the melodies are hummable, almost danceable, with lots of feedback and electric buzz. I found ""Phantom Limb"" and ""A Comet Appears"" above the others. Color me crazy, but ""A Comet Appears"" touches on some deep issues, cool stuff set to electric guitar. What's most enjoyable about The Shins is that they do not seem to take themselves all that seriously, and yet there is some creative heavy stuff going on here. Kudos to this indie bunch !"
4,An amazing record...,"Currently, I haven't finished listening to the new album yet, and already I'm impressed! Melodic, catchy, warm, vibrant, multi-layered, spacey, and psychedelic are some of the words that come to mind. Easily better than Chutes Too Narrow and perhaps even better than Oh, Inverted World! The production on this record is very clear and more than up to par compared to the last two releases. James Mercer's voice stands out very well. A compelling singer too. If you have the first two releases, get this one by all means. You won't be disappointed in the least bit. Even if you don't have anything by this fabulous band, you should still get this one!"
4,A Progression?,"Not sure. I can't help but wonder if this record would have sounded much more similar to the first two if the approach to the post production had been more atmospheric. A terrific album, but it takes a little longer to grab hold because it doesn't have that moodiness to give it a ready-made vibe. Probably my least favorite of the three, but still head and shoulders above the average band. If you like these guys but don't already listen to Spoon, you should give them a listen as well."
5,Wonderful and satisfying,"Where to begin? Every song is excellent. This is mature pop rock at its finest. I do not understand the reviews where people mention this is somehow less than their two previous efforts, no way; it's a big leap forward. Album of the year 2007, by a mile."
1,THOUGHT THE STARS WERE BIGGER,MY SON GOT THESE IN HIS STOCKING. HE LOVES SPACE AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. HE DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THESE. WE THOUGHT THEY WERE BIGGER AND THEY AREN'T EASY TO PUT UP. MOST ENDED UP ON THE FLOOR. GLAD I DIDN'T PAY MUCH
3,Rather serious,It is a serious field in which to prepare for competition. Good luck to those who choose to enter the competion.
1,wrong thing!,"I had waited quite awhile to get this battery, only to have it be the wrong thing when I finally got it. This battery does not fit in the LG C1500! I am very disappointed."
3,Eh,"I found it really hard to start reading, and even more so to continue.The verb usage and way its written sounds slightly like a highschool story in a creative writing class.Its not a bad book, just needs some help."
1,Just read the papers and save your money,"The cross-entropy method is an exciting new technique for rare event simulation and stochastic optimization.The book unfortunately is a 99% copy and paste of the public available tutorials and papers. I bought the book before looking in the internet, so do not do the same mistake by me.Furthermore it is quite disappointing if every chapter is written in a highly redundant manner(which follows automatically if every chapter is a paper on its own).The topic and method is great but the book doesnt add much what the papers wont tell."
1,Miss described,No where does it say you need a hot iron to use this. I don't have an iron and can't afford to send it back
3,too many typos and mistakes,"Can't believe there are so many typos and mathematical mistakes in this OFFICIAL guide. If you have a weak mathematics background, you will be definitely confused or misled."
2,!!!Not enough to get good results!!!,Make sure you check couple other books (not from creators of GMAT exam as this one is). This book is too official- it doesn't reveal any extra tricks you need to succeed.This textbook is good primary to practice on questions as it has many of them.
3,so-so,"I wasnt totally happy w/ this book. As other readers have posted there are countless errors in the math sections. For example on page 335 of the 11th edition they say (xr)^2 = x^(2r). This is hard to look over as a typo - as are other errors.There are also no full-length exams in this book. I mean, come-on, why are the GMAC guys such tight-wads with their questions. I dont really like they way they run the show..."
5,GMAT necessity,"This book is an absolute necessity in prepering for the GMAT. What makes it extremely useful is that it is the official product of the people that make the GMAT, so the questions and problems you will find in this book are similar to the ones on the test.I would also like to point out that I studied from 2 additional books which I would also recommend. First one is Princeton Review (it is excellent in explaining the techniques that ought to be used for test taking and you get 4 test that you can do on your computer) and the second one is Barron's GMAT prep (it has a lot of timed tests which are great for practicing since they emulate the test taking environment and conditions although the questions are not as good as in other mentioned books)."
3,You'd better know what you're doing!,"This is a good review book if you are current on the types of problems you will be solving. I haven't taken a math class in 5 years and need a lot more help with the general theories than this book provides. A great practice book, but only if you understand the theories behind the questions."
5,the bomb,"i've followed PR for a while now and it's great to see they finally made it big and especially with such a dynamic debut, the whole cd is just the bomb and a must get you won't be disapointed and you'll be seeing them all around in the near future BUY NOW!"
1,This CD Really Sucks........,"Papa Roach is really just part of the rock/rap/metal trend that has been popularized by such bands as Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Crazytown, and many others. This CD was really bad. Most of the songs were really bad and really disappointing. I bought the CD after I heard ""Last Resort"" on MTV, and I thought that the rest of the CD might be worth a try. Boy, I'm really glad that I bought this CD on sale.....Don't waste your time or your money on this cd...it's just like all those other trendy poser rock/rap bands."
3,Heavy stuff....not talking just about guitar riffs,"Papa Roach's cd Infest is pretty good for a debut album. However coby talking about suicide and broken home doesnt really make my day cheerful. Everytime I'm done listening to them, im in a worse mood that I started out with. Jerry Horton has some mad guitar riffs, that's what makes this cd worth having. If music can make u mad or sad easily....i wouldn't recommend this."
2,"Glad they ""ditched"" the whole rap/NuMetal Thing","When Papa Roach first hit the scene, I was standing in a bar, and one of their songs came on the radio. I asked my friend, what is this crap that they are playing, he replied, ""Papa Roach"" Ughh, I thought stinking NuMetal Rap/Rock whatever you wanna call it band. Then in 2002 I saw the video (dont ask me why I was watchin MTV) for ""She loves me Not"" and I was suprised that it was Papa Roach. I liked the song so much I picked up ""lovehatetragedy"" and even though not perfect, it was a nice for them to shift over to a more straight up rock vibe. As I got into them more, I decided to pick this up. It's still pretty bad, even though I like the band now, there are two or three good songs here, the most is just throw away garbage. The band has made much progress since this album. If you prefer them as a rock/rap act, this album is for you. If you like them just as a rock band, then you will probely think this is pretty mediocre like I did."
3,OK...,"Well...Alright. This was an ""OK"" album. I mean, you enjoy ""Last Resort"" the first time, but after you buy the album, it's all whining...Except, ""Between Angels and Insects"" was AMAZING...It blows me away, the beautiful guitar riff and lyrics. But, other then that, it's a sub par album. Music wise, it's alright...songs like ""Dead Cell"", ""Broken Home"", and ""Between Angels and Insects"" and cool music. But lyrically, only ""Between Angels and Insects"" and MAYBE ""Dead Cell"" stand out. ..."
3,The fun does not last!,"I bought this CD after hearing Last Resort, which is the second song on the album, a couple of times on the radio. When I got it I loved it. I loved the tunes, i loved the rock/rapcore type of music. I listened to it for about 2 months but i quickly lost interest. Now I haven't listened to it in a couple of months and probably won't listen again for a while. My point is that at first you may think that you love, you probably will love it, but after a bit it will get old. At least if your like me it will. Now you don't have to take my advice but if you aren't rich and don't have the money to buy a new CD every week then consider my words and, if you feel that I might be right, look for a different album to buy. Peace and good buying."
5,Buy this cd.,You got to buy this cd. papa roach is phat. Listen to last resort. Best song on the cd.
5,Awsome CD!,"This is another great CD by Papa Roach. It is very different from there earlier ones, but still good. There is swearing and stuff, but still good. It has lots of creativity, cool guitar, creative lyrics, all put together to make a great CD. ""Infest"" is a very fun CD, you'll listen over and over. There is some kind of rap, rock, punk, and maybe some ska in most of the songs. I really liked how the songs changed sound in the middle, again, lots of creativity and variety.I recommend to anyone who loves punk rock, its an awsome CD."
4,Musically satisfying,"Although the lyrics of singer/rapper Coby Dick leave something to be desired, the music is astounding and so incredibly catchy that it's hard not to love this album. Each song has its own flavor and style to it and the rhythms never stop. Although this will just get tossed into the same genre as a Limp Bizkit - rapMetal - don't go by that genre, this CD is much more musically expanded than Limp Bizkit. Go ahead and buy this album."
4,rock n roll infestation,"This band sounds like a younger version of Black Sabbath. I enjoyed this cd very much. This band is headed in the right direction. I cannot completely judge them until seeing them in concert. But on record they are everything i like. Crunching guitar and melodic rough tunes. This is a 70's sounding band in 2000. Throw out lyrics and vocal. They rock. ""Broken Home"" is a powerful jam. Snakes my personal favorite. A rock n roller from the 70's like me will enjoy this recording."
3,Decent effort,"I heard ""Last Resort"" and just had to get the CD - the song was right up my alley. Unfortunately the rest of the album isn't quite up to par, although there are a few more good songs."
4,Check out this talented new band from California,"Papa Roach has exploded onto the scene with their hit ""Last Resort"" but dont expect it to end there. These boys are not your average one hit wonder. In fact, ""Last Resort"" is not even the best song on the album in my opinion. I personally like ""Infest"", ""Broken Home"", and the explosive lyrics of ""Dead Cell"" even better. Buy this album today, in my opinion the best breakthrough new-group album since Godsmack in 1998. Look for ""Infest"" to be their next single, for it is the best track on the album. They are soft at one second then very loud the next...but yet they are very catchy and consistenly good. Like I said give this album a try and if you like it try Staind and Godsmack."
5,Infest Rules,This has to be there best cd (not including the one there working on now). There is a good mix of rap and heavy metal. I love the guitar in blood brothers and between angels and insects. If you like heavy metal this is a must buy cd. If you like bands like Disturbed and Linkin Park you will like Papa Roach's infest cd. So what are you waiting for go buy it. It is worth the money and the effort.
2,You have already heard the best parts of it,"I admit that i like papa roach to a certain extent.. i have seen the way they rock the stage live, and i like the songs ""Last Resort"" and ""Broken Home"", but as far as the cd goes, those are the only good parts of the cd. Since i first bought the cd, those 2 tracks were the only ones that i enjoyed, and the rest of the album is a bore. If you really must have those 2 songs and/or you are a big papa roach fan, pick this cd up, but don't expect to be amazed by it. My advice: Borrow it from a freind first to see if you really want to spend [money] on it."
4,P. ROACH,"PAPA ROACH IS SO COOL.SOMETIMES I DON'T GO FOR TOO MANY ROCK ARISTS BUT I REALLY LIKE THEM.THE 1ST SINGLE ""LAST RESORT"" IS THE BEST ROCK SONG EVER.IT HAS GOT SO MUCH TRL PLAY AND SOLD OVER 4 MILLION COPIES CUZ OF IT.THE 2ND SINGLE ""BROKEN HOMES"" SHOWS THE MORE ANGERY SIDE OF THE GROUP.P.ROACH ROCKS."
5,Incredible,"I Don't Know Why ""Thrown Away"" Has 9-Minutes and 37 Minutes. The Nice Songs Are ""Bindge"" ""Broken Home"" and ""Last Resort"" and Many More Incredible Songs. Just In Case The Offspring, Bad Religion, NOFX, Lemonheads Is The Punk Rocker To Be Papa Roach's 2000 Academy Award Is The Best Like: Teen Idols, Alternative, Metal, Jazz, Punk, Big Band Is The Academy Award Where I Saw Papa Roach In 2000."
5,Solid Metal Album,"I really enjoyed this album. If you are a fan of older Metallica, older Limp Bizkit, or just metal in general you are likely to enjoy it too."
5,Great,"I've had this album for years and its amazing. It may not be ""true metal"" to some listeners out there (I see that from the other reviews), but its still a great solid album with original sounds to each song, and compelling lyrics. To this day, even though I listened to it non stop years ago, I can still listen to the album and enjoy it. You can't say that about most albums."
1,"Not even good enough to be in your garbage, burn it","Why is it when a genre is created tons of Xerox bands must surface? Think of how many bands were just bad carbon copies of the Beatles, the Clash, Nirvana, and now Faith No More/Rage Against the Machine/Korn. Don't get me wrong, I hate Korn too but I don't deny they were one of the forefathers of ""rap-metal"". I don't even know what to say about these guys because I can't believe their faults aren't obvious to everyone: they make a living ripping off the ideas presented by past artists, their songwriting is completely worthless (just take a look at Broken Home's lyrics, it sounds like something a 7th grader wrote), and none of them are particularly great musicians. Please track down every copy of this album in your hometown and break them with a hammer in the name of innovative music."
5,"No offense but ""the truth"" is wrong.This a sweet rock out cd",This cd is the greatest. This guy really knows how to rock that guitar well..all I have to say is this is an awesome rock out cd! THERE ARE EXTREME IMPORTANT RULES TO FOLLOW WHEN YOU SEE THIS CD.RULE 1:BUY IT!RULE 2:PUT IT IN YOUR STEREORULE 3:CRANK IT UP ALL THE WAYRULE 4:BNAG THAT HEAD!
4,p-roach is awesome,"Well you probably have heard installments like Last Resort, Between Angels and Insects, and Broken Home on the radio. And I loved them and I saw Last Resort on TRL so I got the CD for my birthday. Awesome music. The lyrics are of the most negative I've ever heard. They refer to ADD, divorce, suicide, alcoholism, and non-satisfaction. But the whole thing is geat."
3,quite surprised,"I thought papa roach were one of the bands who screamed like slipknot who had no music sense,i was wrong i first heard ""last resort"" which i thought was brilliant but i only thought that was a one of track but when i heard""between angels and insects""i was very impressed that was even better than ""last resort""so i rushed out to by the album and i wasn't disappointed.Altough it wasn't superb it was still a cracking album with""broken home""""dead cell""""never enough"" and ""binge""and of course the first two singles really standing out.Its a pity the rest of the album didn't quite forfill otherwise this would be up their with the best."
2,Worse than expected...,"I did not expect much for the price, but was nevertheless disappointed.There were quite large visible inclusions (esp. in the main stone and in one of the side stones) which allowed only a few light reflections within the stones (large parts of the stones looked simply ""blind"").In addition, the gold ring was shaped uneven and asymmetrical.Maybe I just got a really bad one...I would not feel comfortable giving this ring to anyone, so I returned it (bought a smaller one with cleaner stones and a whole lot more sparkle)."
3,"A good deal, but a little skimpy","This is a good deal for 10 cds, but there are nno complete pieces except for the Four Seasons by vivaldi, and some shorter piano works. The recording quality is a little bit less than perfect, and it doesn't have teh full vollume of other cds i have. Overall, I recomend buying it, there are some nice pieces on it."
3,Good. I think.,"I have to admit this is not my usual cup of tea. I usually do not find my self intrigued by this genre. I began watching with a bit of trepidation. On first viewing I did not enjoy. It seemed too fast, too silly and too over the top. I decided I did not give it a fair and open viewing so I watched again. On my second watch I liked it a bit better. I actually somewhat enjoyed the story although I thought the plot moved illogically at times and I questioned the character motivations.For what it is it is probably fine. Recommended for fans of the type but not for someone who isn't already an anime fan of sorts."
4,Thad Stone... Suuuuuuuuuper Genius,"Thad was like no other man on Earth, an Earth of the future (2081) written in 1964. Born with super-human intelligence and empathy, he believed his father was no mortal man. Implied rape scene early book. Thad sets out to find his father, a journey that will take him outside his culture, across the world, and into interstellar space. The search is handled interestingly, as Thad discovers the truth about himself (and the author presents an imaginative array of cultures).I didn't expect to enjoy the book as much as I did, but Walter Moudy has a few really great scenes that stick with you. Calini's equation was excellent, and so was Yan's concert. Normally don't recommend books from the pulp fiction era, but this one was good. I liked it."
2,Thumbs down. Mudhoney did this better 15 years ago.,"The best song on this album is ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" because it's the only thing that smacks of a new direction for the Queens while maintaining their originality and more importantly, their heavy sound. Other than that, it's really hard to figure out why these guys are picked to lead the parade of real modern hard (some call it ""stoner') rock when there are MUCH better and more powerful bands out there (High on Fire and Electric Wizard come to mind) that write more memorable riffs than these guys do. Sorry, but this stuff doesn't even come CLOSE to any Kyuss album I've heard. It just sounds like second-rate Mudhoney/Green River re-hashes. Not exactly what I would pick to define a genre. Of course, with Interscope, Rolling Stone and Spin overdriving the hype machine for QOTSA, who can stop them?"
5,Expanding and Bringing Home Rock Music All at Once,"Rated R succeds by bringing a kind of simplicity, honesty, and passion to rock without making any sacrifices. It is experimental while still using down-to-earth, soulful rock that can give you a grateful dead type high.By letting their passion for music drive the creativity of the album instead of gimicks, they created a truthful image of how we all want life and rock to be: uncompromising, wild, full of energy, full of soul.And while its merits may not be available immediately to the casual listener, if given the proper opportunity it will open the door to a new type of rock that up until very recently has been un-noticed by the mainstream."
4,this album belongs on vinyl,"i really thought they didn't make records like this anymore. i read the 4 star review of this in q magazine and gave it a try on impulse. boy, it took me back. hearing r for the first time is like hearing your first black sabbath lp. or your first dose of gong or hawkwind. the musicianship is outstanding and accomplished, but there's an irreverence and a spontanaeity about the whole thing too. you can just picture this motley collection of long-haired, pot-smoking guys, sitting around coming up with the stuff. there's something very seventies underground alternative rock about it, yet something really today about it too. it's odd, but instant. and cheap too. try it."
5,You can count on this band,If you like the Queens of the Stoneage you owe it to yourself to buy this record.You will not be disappointed
4,THIS BOOK LEAVES NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION!!,THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS IVE READ THIS YEAR.CAIN REALLY DOES NO HOW TO HOOK AN AUDIENCE WITH HIS VERY VIVID IMAGINATION. THIS BOOK REALLY DID KEEP MY EYES GLUED AND I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE. SO I WOULD ADVISE THIS BOOK TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ABOVE.
4,Livid.,"A voyeuristic look into the shallow, callow amorality of people on the side of the interstate. The sex scenes still have clothes ripping, lip biting, carnal shock value--probably why it sold so well!"
5,Powerful Noir,"This is the classic story of murder and adultery tied up in a tightly woven style that is in your face from the opening paragraph. Drifter, Frank Chambers comes upon a greasy spoon diner and falls in love with the owner's wife, Cora, a former small-town beauty queen who made do with a man has grown tired of and is now disgusted by. After a short and brutal affair, they agree that the key to their happiness together is to rid themselves of Nick, Cora's husband.The murderous, adulterous couple carefully plot and carry out their plan with straightforward efficiency, fully expecting that the result will bring them together to live in peace and happiness. But this is classic noir fiction, so a happy ending is simply out of the question.It's an amazingly powerful book that cuts right to the chase, scene after scene, ensuring that the all-important emotions of fear and hatred stand out even more starkly."
3,"Decent, but...","Two weeks ago, I read ""Double Indemnity"" and was blown away! It was the first hard boiled book I ever read and couldn't wait to read ""Postman."" Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. The characters are idiots compared to Walter Huff and Phylis Nirdlinger, the murder was boring, and it pales beside ""Double Indemnity."" It's unfortunate that Cain was too busy writing about LA to ever mention his native Baltimore... Anyway, if are just starting with James' books, like I was 2 weeks ago, read ""Postman"" before ""Indemnity"" to prevent the disapointment I felt."
3,No Maggie Mae,Different but still good Rod. I love American Songbook CDs by formidable singers and Rod is holding his own with this CD.
1,Worse than I feared,"When I first learned Stewart was going to record these tunes I cringed. Turn out, its was worse than I feared.Quite simply, Rod Stewart lacks the style and heart to make these songs his own. What made performers like Sinatra great was they truly emboldened the songs they sang with a depth and character. They made them their own. Rod Stewart is just a stand in who doesn't contribute anything new to the performance of this music and his signature raspy voice simply kills legendary hits like ""The Way You Look Tonight"".This album isn't about bringing a new vision to the performance of these classics. It's about Rod Stewart trying to milk one last cent out of a fading career. If you want to enjoy a modern restyling of great jazz and vocal favorites, pickup any CD from Diana Krall. She delivers soulful, extraordinary performances in the tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nancy Wilson, Ertha Kitt, and Frank Sinatra. That's how it's supposed to be done."
1,anti-pirating mechanism,They've finally done it! RIAA has developed an uncrackable anti-pirating technology and it is comprised of filling this disc with a cacophony of painful sounds.
4,Rod Stewart finds some great songs,Full marks to the producers of this record. Some nice takes on good songs.
1,DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE!,"Rod Stewart is a great singer. These are greatsongs. But this is a terrible mismatch of artistand material. He just seems too timid to really diginto the real meaning of these classics. Even worse,the arrangements are run-of-the-mill lounge fare,nothing like the imaginative charts of Nelson Riddle,Billy May, Marc Shaiman or Rosemary Clooney's sidemen.This is just another piece of Clive Davis ""product"",like the awful job he did on the Dionne Warwick SingsCole Porter CD some years back. Your money would bebetter spent on a Nat King Cole CD, or one of thecountless Rod Stewart ROCK compilations that show thisgreat singer at his best."
5,Rod Stewart's songs of the past albums,"I am not a fan of Rod Stewart - well I wasn't...but these 4 albums are really very very good. Enjoyable, relaxing, refreshing....just alot of good old fashioned music done with a nice mellow attitude. If you're a fan of this kind of music, these are some of the best renditions I've ever heard."
1,A shell of Rod,"Listening to this album made me think back to when I was a kid and the N.Y Mets were playing in the World Series against the Oakland A'S. The great Willie Mays, perhaps the greatest centerfielder in the history of the game, was out there dropping balls and even falling on his face while chasing a fly ball. My dad was crying! He had grown up watching Willie in his glory days doing it like no one else, he loved Mays so much and it broke his heart to see him struggle with only a whisp of his once great talents. As a longtime Rod Stewart fan I felt the same way listening to this album. It's like a Hall of Famer batting .200 and falling on his face on a routine fly ball when he used to be an MVP, batting champion, Gold Glove, slugger. It's time to fade away now, Rod, and let us exalt you for your glorious past. Don't be like Mike, out there blowing what used to be slam dunks."
2,YAAAAWN!,"The songs are great, but they don't suit Stewart's voice. Check out Steve Tyrell or Curt Stigers for quirky but excellent musical interpretations of all these wonderful standards. I give this cd 2 stars only because I credit Stewart for bringing great songs to the attention of some people who may have really never appreciated them before. Hopefully they'll love the music enough to go hunt down some artists whose styles are more suited to give these tunes their due."
5,Dinner Music at its BEST,"I am always looking for a great CD to listen to while entertaining at my dinner parties. I have every genre of music to coordinate with the theme of the party that I am throwing. I was confident that this CD would be FABULOUS and was right on the money with my prediction. Rod Stewart does a SUPERB job of singing the ""oldies"". If you enjoy Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick, Jr., you will be sure to LOVE this compilation by Rod Stewart. Open a bottle of wine, sit down and enjoy some conversation while listening to a WONDERFUL collection of songs sung by a CLASSIC performer."
1,THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK,"NEVER BEFORE HAS ANYONE BEEN IMPRISONED FOR ABSOLUTELY POOR MUSICAL PERFORMANCE, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN THIS CASE AND LOCK HIM UP BEFORE MORE DAMAGE IS DONE TO THESE BEAUTIFULL SONGS. I WISH THESE RECORDINGS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AFTER I PASSED FROM THIS EARTH. THIS IS THE DAY 'THE MUSIC DIED'. ONE GOOD THING I COULD SAY....ALL SINGERS WHO HAVE PERFORMED THESE WORKS NOW WILL SOUND MUCH BETTER BY COMPARISON TO ROD. ROD, PLEASE STOP NOW , HAVE YOU NO MERCY!!!!!R. BEEGLE"
5,Rod Stewart CD,This item was purchased as a gift for a friend who listen to our CD and loves it. She was so excited to receive this item as a gift.
1,Terrible....,"This CD is just terrible. An old icon, a##-kickin' rocker trying desperately to stay in the limelight with this recording. What was he thinking!!?? He is totally incapable of delivering any of these songs. Rather than listening again & again, this disc will quickly find it self in the trash!"
5,"The more I play it, the more I love it!",I love the old standards and I love Rod Stewart -- so how could I resist this CD? I hope Rod continues to release this type of music for square old broads like me.
1,"Sinatra, Darin, Martin, must be spinning in their graves!","Save your money! You want to hear 1930s and 40s tin pan alley classics sung by vocalists who truly possess fine voices, then purchase Sinatra, Darin, Bennett, Damone, Fitzgerald, or Peggy Lee. This Rooster with a voioce like sandpaper with strep throat should remain relegated to that one musical genre where such a less-than-medicre performer can still be considered a ""star,-----simply arranged, unilaterally structered Rock and Roll"" gibberish. That's the league he belongs in...along with other such stellar vocalists as Kim Carnes and Joe Cocker. But let's be serious, Ol Rooster Head had no business trying to foray into territory long-claimed by the brilliant vocal tonality, phrasing, and styles of such truly brilliant sigers like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitgerald, Bobby Darin, Mel Torme, Peggy Lee, and Matt Monro (just to name a few). The Rooster tried, but it was a futile attempt..."
3,When song writing was a real art,"They don't write 'em like this anymore. The arrangements on this CD are lush and lavish. The trumpet solos bring back memories of Harry James (and I'm too young to remember Harry James!) The only downside is the vocalist. His raspy voice is almost an anachronism when you consider the smooth, controlled voices originally singing this stuff. It's somewhat prophetic when he warbles ""...the way you sing off key."" Still, you can't take that away from us!"
5,We loved it!!!!!!,"We had heard his All American II at a party one Friday, loved it and ordered both from Amazon the next day. Went on a trip on Sunday and listened over and over to both CDs. Mr. Stewart does justice to the 'oldies' and lending is own personal style gave a great new sound to them. We thoroughly enjoy them and so do our friends."
1,Stewart and Standards Don't Work!,"I just bought this album and after listening to it, I have to say it is one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. Rod Stewart's coarse voice just doesn't do anything for the classic American songs on this album. The kind of melodies on this CD need a soft, soothing voice to compliment them, which Rod Stewart definitely does not have! If you really want to hear these songs done properly, look for recordings by Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Harry Connick, Jr., etc. who know how to do justice to these songs."
1,More Bland Than Cream Potatoes,"If you're idea of excitement is staring at the floor, this album's for you. Put this CD on and you may find yourself so overwhelmed with adventure that you'll be staring at the walls as well.If you enjoy Rod Stewart's voice, or hard rock and roll, Rod's first four solo albums and his four with the Faces are pretty much essential.If you enjoy the kind of songs presented here, you'd be far better off listening to the greats, like Crosby, Sinatra, Cole, Holliday, Streisand , etc., etc., etc. Louis Armstrong may not have been a great singer, but he had more character in his little toe than this recording.Hey, most small town orchestras are more adventureous than this. Dentist office music is less obtrusive.Hope I'm not being too harsh, but I just can't find any reason whatsoever to recommend this album (or any of it's five follow-ups). Wait a minute - these albums are professionally performed, recorded, produced, and marketed. That's positive - right?"
3,"Great all-around bass drum head, but I still prefer regular clear Ambassador","This head will definitely give you more low end, but it's kind of a colored, muddy low end. The Remo Clear Ambassador bass drum head feels better, and is more versatile."
5,Outstanding resouce,"I am a psychololgist. I read this book very carefully and outlined it, it was that good. It is very practical information on how to deliver difficult news. I found that I deliver more difficult news than I thought. I use the six steps outlined in the book now, and teach residents about the book. This is the best resouce I found for delivering bad news to patients."
5,great ice breaker,"This is chock full of great advice when you don't know what to say, or are feeling slightly shy or uncomfortable. Just curling up with these study cases in how to tell someone their colon is infecting their entire body and they only have a few weeks to live, or that a hemorrhage in their daughters brain will keep her in a state of vegetation for the rest of her ... life is enough to make anyone feel better about their own situation. Not sure what to say at a party? Just imagine yourself in one of these terrible situations and you'll thankfully be chatting up a storm."
2,Questionable for Eczema,My son has eczema and we bought this product based on the reviews and description. He had some sort of reaction to it and broke out exacerbating his eczema...so please try it on a small area first if you are using it for eczema.
2,Not effective,"I bought this product for girlfriend who diligently used it four times a day a for a week. This pretty much used up the entire container and we noticed zero improvement. Sad. With lofty reviews for this product, we were hoping for more."
1,Trash,"I laughed when I realized this was the ""manual"" I ordered on Amazon. I can sum it up for you with the following: Why write ""The subject transitioned to a retreating posture, indicative that he was avoiding me..."" when you could write ""The suspect turned around and walked in the opposite direction, away from me."" This is, in fact, the whole book. I do also question the authenticity of the reviews on this item supposedly made by experienced LEOs and FTOs.I am not going to end my efforts in developing my narratives, most importantly for prosecution cases, but I will shop for my next buy at my nearest bookstore."
5,The Best from Wrox in Years,"Hoffman jumps quickly through this book and you will need to read his other books to see what he leaves out. Security, discussions, community aspects are bare but the best thing about this book is the application of a CMP (Container Mapping Persistence) - a tool from the Java world that was until now impossible to build under MS technologies. Now that we have that I cant wait until it becomes standard. I've already begun to port all our applications to this. It is that good."
3,Interesting court room drama about a sad event.,Excellent court drama starring Richard Basehart. The docu-drama is faithful to the trial transcripts . Harrison Ford is given top billing on the cover of the DVD but in fact appears only briefly in the DVD as one of the members of Calley's platoon.The short-comings in the drama are the narrations to try and explain to trial and add comentary. I thought it was unneccesary breaks in the drama but I imagine it was done due to commerical interruptions.The actress that plays Calley's wife is one awful actress. It is almost embarrasing to watch her performance.All in all it is a classic Allan Lansbury quality docu-drama.
1,Not what I had expected based on reviews,"I did not know this was a Christian book and was disappointed with all the references. Also, felt the characters were not well developed and the entire story was expected and boring."
2,Not the greatest.,"I am only half way through this book, so I can't judge it totally, but I like the story line. However, it's not too well written; too full of descriptions and isn't one of my favorites. I am not too impressed at this point."
3,Predictable and sappy,"I love Karen Kingsbury, but this book was so ""cutesy"". I felt it was more on a child's level than adult. I did resent the little boy's prayers ending in Gee his name. (for Jesus' name) Any little child I know can say it better than that. Can't love 'em all. I love her Family series."
2,Beyond Let Down,"To say I was let down by this film is an understatement. We go from Tess being a farm girl to a noblewoman in 5 minutes. We go through her meeting her ""cousin"" Alec, the affair (on screen a one time interlude), and the birth & death of their baby at lighting speed. Nothing is clearly explained and it's all confusing. Enter in her heart breaking marriage to Angel and one must say just how bad can this movie get. While Nastassja Kinski and Peter Firth are an extremely attractive couple they lack any sort of on screen chemistry. To watch this movie is to spend 3 hours in the midst of the most miserable heart break and despair. This is NOT a feel good flick."
2,sloow,"I read and liked the novel, but the movie was so slow. I'm amazed it got the attention it did. Kinski is beautiful in it (and she still is. I just saw her today in person, filming a movie in Newport Beach. And she is a beauty), but the pace of this movie is slug-like. Read the novel instead."
1,Don't buy this book.,"The book's title is misleading. They should have take out the words ""Practical"" and ""C++"". It's very academic, and a few REAL C++ codes.This book is not for beginners, and not practical, not written with C++ in mind (or OO programming).The first impression I've got when I opened this book is that I thought I was reading someone's thesis."
2,You get what you pay for...,This is a budget price DVD and the print is no better than what you would record off television. Get it only if you're a fan of Robert Conrad or Erin Gray. The print is terrible.
2,mmm erin,"I just bought it because Erin Gray's in it. She should do more acting, she's really good. Tasty to the eye, too. Other than that, the movie's ok."
3,A GREAT MURRAY WILSON > Arlen Dean Snyder,"A GREAT MURRAY WILSON > Arlen Dean Snyder. He should've been in the 2000 release ""The Beach Boys: An American Family"" as Murray and not in this cheesy re-make with a ""really short"" Brian Wilson. Kevin Dunn as Murray is okay in ""The Beach Boys: An American Family"" but Snyder ""is"" Murray Wilson."
2,I'm the author and this movie is awful,"This is a terrible, exploitive movie. Rent it on Netflix, it's not worth owning."
2,Not enough heat,"I picked this heater up at Wal-Mart for $15. It's intended use was for our office/spare bedroom. This particular room is freezing, it's as if there is no insulation! The room is about 10'x12'.Well, after letting this new heater run for a couple hours, I was kind of disappointed with the heat output. I ran it on the high setting, and had it cranked all the way up, but it was only warm within 2 feet in front of it.My father has an old little space heater about half the size of this, and his kicks the heat!*Update* After using this for several weeks, I would change the rating to 3 stars. The first day I used it, it was particularly cold out, and this heater was having a hard time taking the chill off the room.But most of the time is does a decent job of warming the room.Only other problem is that it is a bit loud when it's running."
2,Totally Outdated,"This is from 2004 people. COmpletely OUTDATED. Pricing of schools, directors of schools, philosophies of the schools all:OUTDATEDWant a starting point - Save yourself the time & energy and buy a more recent copy of anything regarding preschool philosophies. That will give you the basic grounding.As for getting into preschool in SF, Open houses are in the Fall. Give yourself 2 year lead time. Apply early. Follow up and watch your child's personality - it will change from when you apply to when you get in (as it takes so long).And cross your fingers, say prayers to any gods you can think of and make wishes on candles & stars.good luck"
5,With a little bit of help from me friends like,"It took 4 weeks for it to arrive but that was my fault like. The book was helpfull in some ways and in other it wasn't. I was a litle confused that it did not include my dishwasher. However with a lttle bit of studying I sucesfully fixed, it, in a fashion. However my wife didn't like the noise the machine made after I fixed,(we have since divorced, but it was other problems). I hope this was helpfull."
3,Debussy was not included and that made me sad.,I am just back to playing piano again. I listen to classical music all the time to help my ear and find music I like. Not sure I would have agreed on this 100 top rating.
5,The first of a wonderful series,"This is the first book in a wonderful series of adventure stories about ordinary children doing fairly ordinary things that make wonderful reading. The children are creative and imaginative, but in ways you can relate to and feel that you could be doing these fun things too.I could say a great deal more -- I have read all the stories multiple times, and my children have worn out several copies of them -- but I'll leave it at this: if you know a child from about 8 on up, get them these books and watch them turn into passionate readers."
4,A true classic,"This is one of my most memorable childhood reads. My mother gave me her copy to read when I was a child, and I was transported into a world where self-sufficient children had their own boats and raced one another and had marvellous adventures. The 'swallows' and the 'amazons' of the title were teams/tribes of children, friends and competitors."
3,"Is it the book, or your childhood imagination?","This book comes enormously recommended by the Brits who read it as children. I read it as an American adult and I'll be interested to see what my children make of it. I think it fits into those books that were so magical not because of what they contained but because of what I, the 10 year old reader, contained. I can see this story of summer freedom with a sailboat, as a jumping off point for imagination.My childhood equivalent was ""What the Witch Left"" -- it was my mind that made it a five star book."
1,misleading vendor,Vendor uses misleading photos in their ads for their over-priced product that you actually receive. Beware and read the ad carefully.
5,great movie,This movie is great and is a great addition to an amazingly funny franchise that always brings the sexy and romantic along with humor.In my opinion the Eating Out movies are like the gay version of American Pie and always worth watching.
4,Awesome,"Great sexy movie. It starts out slow and maybe a bit over the top, but it ends to be very hot and romantic. It's worth the buy. :-)"
2,Don't bother,Not up to the standard of the series.I wish I would of rented before I bought! The acting was oKay but the story line lacked substance and not as funny as previous movies.
5,Classics!!,"There may not be two better Westerns ever made. Both movies explore the settling of the West and the battle between the ranchers (bad guys) and the settlers (good guys).Shane's beautiful photography is spellbinding. Alan Ladd and Van Heflin turn in great performances and Jean Arthur is stunning. The supporting cast is unbelievable.Liberty Valance, shot in B/W, also has stunning photography. John Wayne, James Stewart and Lee Marvin are in top form. Many, many great moments in this movie (""No, YOU pick it up Valance"", ""Print the legend"").This is great double feature (just like the old days) at a very affordable price!"
5,Arizona Lfe saver,"This is not my first Vornado, I have one in every room. This one was purchased for the living room and it is the perfect sitting on the couch or armchair height. We live in the Phoenix area so summertime is hot and I hate air conditioning not only for the cost but also I am prone to sinus attacks. I seldom need to turn this fan up from the lowest speed and it is almost silent. Easy to put together and two minutes out of the box you are ready to turn the best fan I have ever found. This is one product you should not skimp on as it will pay for itself by the savings you will see on your electric bill."
1,incredibly overrated,"Expensive - Only lasted one year - Fell over a lot - Never buying this brand againNot that I can name a better brand, but ever other fan that I've had costed less and lasted longer ( I can't remember having a fan just break )What a disappointment!"
4,Very bad packaging but great product,So far we have ordered 3 Vornados and have only been able to keep 1. They keep arriving broken. The one we do have works fantastic it is just a pain having to keep returning them to get one that will work.
4,Good album,"Out of the two new albums, I would rank ""sweat"" better than ""suit"", but this cd still has a great chance of makin it big. Best song is the hit single featuring Jaheim, ""My PLace."" Check both of these albums out!!!"
1,NELLY IS POSSIBLY THE WORST RAPPER EVER,"i cannot believe this rubbish has gone platinum, what is this?, nelly has to be possibly the worst rapper ever to pick up a mic, in fact, calling him a rapper is an insult to rap, hes a pop artist, he has no flow, no good lyrics, he does not rap about anything meaningful or deep,he is ruining rap and making it seem like a joke, which is quickly what its becoming, nelly, along with ja rule, chingy, 50 cent, the game and all the other terrible rappers, should be banned from rapping, i cant believe nelly had the nerve to diss KRS-one, who killed him on a diss, and if krs-one was more famous, and more people heard the diss, it would have ended nellys career, like mf doom said""Viktor the director flip a script like Rob Reiner, the way a lot of dudes rhyme their name should be knob-shiner""peace"
4,The Softer Side of Nelly,"Where most rappers are looking towards the true gangsta image, ""Suit"" seems likes somewhat of a departure. Its shows a more R&B based rap, which is a great disguise on the first single, ""My Place"" featuring Jaheim. The sampling on ""My Place"" is ingenius and it is one of the biggest hits of the year (for me at least). My favorite songs are ""My Place"", ""Pretty Toes"", ""Paradise"", ""She Don't Know My Name"", ""Nobody Knows"" (brilliant job as usual Anthony Hamilton!), and ""Die For You"". Overall, I'd recommend this album to anyone!"
1,total crap,"if this has that damn smelly/tim mccrap conpliation all copies should be burned, even though rap and new countey pop aren't even music it's all crap. still that stupid song is the new champ for worst ever!!! it makes you wanna kill yourself it's so annoying..well not untill you kill nelly and tim mcgrath....AVOID!!! don't support this manufactured trash, ROCK N ROLL FOREVER, they even write and sing (ashley simpson and most rap/pop losers))thier own songs unlike todays crap artists!"
3,I Need Nelly NOT to Sing,"Nelly has put St Louis on the map, but he does not need to sing. On the tracks of this album, he is heard trying to hold a note when he is heard at all. You cannot call Nelly a true rapper and you cannot call any of his albums, true rap albums. His style is sing-song. The best song on ""Suit"" is ""In My Life"" with Avery & Mase. This song has a nice jamaican feel to it and a catchy chorus. Buy this CD if you want to hear Nelly singing-or trying to sing."
1,nelly is back,"anyway this guy knows how to make money money... album is funny commercial like always whateva man bling bling foeva... i'd say cd was done very quickly, couse the music like this is doable like fast food."
3,Comfy but has a strange sharp smell,"This product is pretty comfortable, but it has a starnge almost pungent smell that does not seem to go away."
5,Wrist helper,"This is an awesome gel pad. I always ""knew"" that optical could work without a pad but this pad is great. I replaced a home fashioned wrist pad with this and I could immediately tell the difference.The gel feels great and actually cushions your hand while you use the mouse on the pad. The pad isn't incredibly small, nor large, but it is ""perfect"" if you know how to use a mouse without moving it all over the place."
2,Belkin F8E262cSLV WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad (Silver,"Gee, nothing special about this mousepad. I thought the wrist rest would be good, but it's odd to feel it there and I don't notice any benefit. Othwerwise it operates as well as any mousepad I guess."
3,"Readable, but a Paraphrase","A hip packaging of the ""Living Bible,"" a paraphrase of the good old KJV. As such, it not only shares the KJV's textual shortcomings, but exchanged the ambiguity for readability. Not a good study Bible, but one I managed to cruise through, cover to cover, begats & all, when I was 15. It's a trip everybody in Western culture should take at least once. This version makes it far less daunting than it used to be.5 stars for readability. 2 stars for the quality of the text. Several more modern translations, such as the NIV, make much better compromises...."
5,Careless Whispers,"I have not read Carlton Stowers before, but I won't let that happen again.He writes so well that I couldn't put the book down.. Normally, I enjoy a true crime story once in a while but not too often.. Mr Stowers writes so well that I plan to read all of his books.. Truman Capote captured my interest with ""In Cold Blood"" & now it is Carlton Stowers..I might go back to James Patterson in the future, but I'll read a lot of ""Stowers"" first....."
1,one sided,Just a reminder when reading this story that the author is a friend of the prosecutor. It has true parts but it is one sided. It is the story that the prosecution would like for people to believe.I hope some day the other side of the story will be printed. The 3 teens that died in Waco were not the only innocent deaths in this story.
1,The only problem with the book...,"...is that it is probable that David Wayne Spence, who was executed for the murders in April of 1997, was innocent and that Truman Simons, Stowers' hero, was a liar."
5,Perfect First Books,This is one of the only books that retains my 13 mo. old son's attention. I highly recommend it as a 1st book.
4,Good Pacing,"I watched the sub of this show, and on my way to pick this up. Just to get some perspective the Japanese title is Souko no Strain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soukou_no_Strain). This was one of the most memorable 13 episode series I've seen. The motifs tend to be strange towards the end, I need to re-watch the end of the series, but the pacing of the story is fantastic.The tempo of the series is like, now get ready for this, the first half of the first season of Death Note. It really surprises you, and is unique due to the story. I think the person who'll enjoy this is someone who would enjoy Gunparade March. Where you don't watch it for the mecha, exactly, but for what situation the character finds themselves in. If you go into this series looking for pure action, you won't be necessarily disappointed, but for me, it wasn't the point. The point was the struggle the main character found herself in and how she worked through it. I recommend a watch for the points mentioned above."
5,S.T.R.A.I.N. Review,"In truth, I had never heard of STRAIN before, so I was very curious to see what it was about. The plot itself is VERY WELL done and detailed. I especially liked the Strains themselves because the detail that was done was INCREDIBLE! I did not mind the profanity in it, nor did I mind the other content in it, because that is a common part of anime now. I gave this particular anime a 5 star rating because the story was very thorough, the characters were excellently represented, and the overall experience was a very enlightening one for me."
4,Who'd a thunk it,"Finally, a way to keep market madness in perspective. Pontification with poetry. This is a unique work that deserves a wide audience for the fresh approach it brings to our current obsessions."
3,it's okay,I like it because it is really good product. Thanks for sell this parts for me.see you next time. Bye
3,ener-g tapioca hamburger buns,"I first ate these buns in Disney World. They served them everywhere to anyone who needed gluten-free bread. They are low in calories and do not have that awful taste usually present in white rice breads. While I know there are tastier gluten-free breads, I rely on these because they are acceptable and low in calories. Mary Ann"
1,Uh...yuck.,"I agree with reviewer ""Redbeard"". Scott sounded great with Creed, but after hearing him scream through the first song. Then I found myself cringing through the rest because of the off key notes he hit. The only good song was the one he released. It was like the lyrics did not fit with the music. His voice was awesome with Creed, plus he's pretty nice to look at, but a solo artist I think he needs some pointers or new writers."
4,Scott Stapp has returned,Don't get me wrong this cd has some good songs. I don't wanna say he has changed because you can still tell the creed sound is there he has just gotten a little softer. Good solo effort!
4,Solid,"While nothing musically outstanding, I like the straightforward songwriting on this album. I don't care for the vocals on a couple of the songs (Justify, Hard Way), which surprised me since Scott is one of my favorite singers. The first five tracks are slowly growing on me, but the second half of the disc I really like. SURROUND ME is a great song and BROKEN is just amazing. Definitely a cd worth buying."
1,Sounds great if you have the volume turned off,A friend of mine gave this to me as a joke. Very funny. So funny i forgot to laugh. This is the worst 'collection' of songs i've heard this millenium and the vocals match the material perfectly. What an underserved ego trip. Awful.
2,Over Priced--NOT a cleaning kit.,"I was deciding between two and three stars. As a general assessory kit, this was fine but this was listed as a complete care and cleaning kit which it is DEFINITELY not. There is one tiny half pipe cleaner and a brush (2 in 1) and that's the extent. I needed something to clean between the keys and joints and this is definitely, definitely not it. However, it does come with a bunch of cloths and leather like pieces for buffing. It does not include a user pamphlet as stated."
2,Not Really Necessary,"The only thing in this kit that a beginning flutist really needs is the polishing cloth--provided (s)he has a silver or silver-plated flute. At that, I'd prefer a Sunshine cloth to the cloth in this kit. A beginner doesn't need oil for the springs and certainly doesn't need cork grease. I'm not sure quite what one would do with the little brush--I suppose if you had bad flute care habits it would let you brush lint or dirt away from the keys and workings. The chamois cloths are too small and thick to use to mop the inside of the flute though they do a nice job of getting rid of fingerprints on the outside. Instead of buying this kit obtain an old cotton or linen handkerchief (to use with the cleaning rod provided with your flute), a box of alcohol wipes (to clean the outside of the flute--don't get them near the pads-- and a Sunshine cloth for polishing. If you really want it all also get some curl papers ($2 for 1,000) to remove moisture from the pads."
3,Not the greatest of this series,Paths of Darkness wanders away from the typical set of characters. Some will enjoy the exploration of something different but I didn't find these stories as interesting as past installments. If you're a fan of the series I would definitely suggest you not skip these but on their own I wouldn't give them a second look.
4,Forgotten Realms,"Great series in a great series - I am a fan of the Forgotten Realms.This series was interesting and continued the adventures of our old Friends, Drizzit, Bruenor, Cattie-Brie Wulfgar and Regis.I went into this expecting more of the hack and slash mixed in with minor character development and moving the stories of all the friends along - and thats is what I got.For me it did bog down some with the Drow elements, but it always does for me - I just dont find the Drow politics and machinations all that interesting. And MOST of the 3rd book is totally dedicated to the Drow Jarlaxle and his merry band (HA HA) and their in-fighting and scheming.All in all - if you enjoy the Forgotten Realms in general, and the Drizzit books in particular, this is a good series. If you do like I did and get the 4 books in a single collectors edition hardback so you dont have to hunt each one down, it is a LONG read - but worth the time."
3,Surprising fun full of sight gags,"The main thread in this visual shenanigan belongs to the ever watchable Zhou Xun. She's a frigid, geeky scientist who invents a love potion, essentially extracting pheromones and then wearing them like a smoker's patch. The patches get tossed around among the three ladies and the objects of their desire. Kwai Lunmei is awesome as a punk rocker who eventually meets her imaginary boyfriend, and a pleasant surprise is Kitty Zhang Yuqi (from CJ7) playing a high powered sexuality-exuding executive who wants to market the patches. This is a goofy film full of sight gags, not to be taken seriously. An average film, flawed, but worth wasting time on just to watch three lovely ladies having fun."
3,it's ok,"It's a good and average rap CD. It contains quite a few more good tracks than just ""lick it"" - try e.g. ""my girl"". If you like female rappers, this is another steady album"
3,Dirty South,"I first heard ""My Neck, My Back"" on the radio weeks ago. It didn't seem to have much of a beat, and half the time I couldn't understand what this chick was saying (because so much was cut out). Then the other night, my friend turned me on to the unedited version, and it's a great song to dance to. Then she clicked thru the other songs, only letting me hear like 10 seconds of each. And you know how it is: When somebody else has the remote, EVERYTHING sounds good! So I asked if I could borrow her c.d., and she said yes. I took it home and immediately found my fave track: F*** Dem Other Ho's. That song is awesome to bounce to in the car, and she's really representin' the dirty-dirty, which is cool. She's like Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim's styles combined...it's tight! If you can handle the dirty talk, and u like hardcore female rappers this [artist] is definetly where it's at!"
3,ALL GIRLS NEED LOVE !!!,"""My neck,my back"" is a hot song for the club, but the thing is, Khia does not need to be singing about someone lickin her ""YOU KNOW WHAT"". I mean what in the world is going on! I can't believe she has the nerve to be singin about her neck and back,then again, all girls need love!"
1,didn't work for me,"I read some bad reviews on this item, but decided that for the price, I could risk it. Unfortunately it didn't work at all for me, so it was a bust."
4,"Wow, that's a big bag","Great bag, plenty of room for one or two. I also got a fleece sleeping bag liner and have not had to use it to keep warm. It is definitely a car camping sleeping bag, not one you would want to carry on a pack. It is very warm and comfortable. To get it in it's carrying bag you have to fold in half and roll sideways, a couple of compression straps help too. I have plans for a February camping trip in the Mountains, I am looking forward to comfortable nights in this bag."
5,Great bag,"This is a great bag , I am a big dude 6'1 225lbs , me and the wife fit no problem , other bags I dont even fit alone . it is also very warm and comfortable . my 7 year old son loves to get lost inside like its a cave . so not only does it work but keeps kids busy on rainy days. AAA+++"
4,big and warm but a little too big....,This is a very warm spacious bag but putting it back in the bag it came in is like trying to stuff a watermelon through a golf hole. Unless you have something BIG enough to store this sleeping bag it's going to take up a lot of space.
5,Gangster classics,"Who would mind three great actors and the best to play ganster characters ever: Jimmy Cagney, Bogie and Edward G. Robinson. Each of these movies are gems for their kind taking us back to Prohibition Era, produced during the 30's and the beginning of the 40's.If you are a Cagney fan then you should try this, for the sake of adding value to your Jimmy collection.Remember that if you buy each of these movies separately the cost will be considerably consistent and you might try this collection as it offers the same movies and special features."
5,Brilliant,"I absolutely loved this book, over the years my love for Japan had faltered but A Drummer's Beat to Mend surely reconnected me with my love for Japan and its culture. The book is gorgeous slow but it warms up appropriately to whet you appetite for a good and well organized book that explores the love between McKenna and Tetsuro"
5,"A Different, Diverse Story (4.5 Stars)","Book Description: Tetsuro Takamitsu, a Japanese drummer, has devoted his life to taiko drumming, sacrificing family for performing. McKenna Stafford, an African American doctor, has given her life to medicine, abandoning hope of marriage and children. Brought together by a freak accident, McKenna finds her heart repaired as she mends Tetsuro's hand. Can they overcome their differences to build a family together?I loved Tetsuro Takamitsu and McKenna Stafford's story: the Japanese cultural information, the development, the pace, and especially the characters (flaws and all) - with the exception of the slap. --- Henceforth the 4.5 and not a 5."
4,Quick Wax Works Well,"The Glosser wax cloths do work well, but you can't use it too much or it will leave fibers all over the paint."
5,Miracle in a soft package,"Whoever invented the Glosser should get a medal. It takes me less than eight minutes to do my full-sized black car, and when done, it is better than showroom shiny. I take a couple of Glossers with us on trips, so car always stays clean. When finished with car, there is still enough left to do wheels, too!!"
1,"false advertising, shows images of other toys not included","buyer beware, wishbone toy only not a 3 pack as advertised, and at three times what it costs in a local store, should have stayed away from non amazon sellers"
1,Great toddler bed,"We purchased this bed five months ago for our then 16 month old. My husband was out of town when it arrived. I put it together by myself in about a half an hour with no difficulty whatsoever. It's very sturdy, all wood, and not too high off the ground. My son has slept in it from day one with no problems."
2,"great bed, horrible service","We recieved this bed without the screws, bolts, etc. Called the number for missing parts and it was disconnected. All the other numbers we called went to a message machine and we never heard back from the company. Finally my husband went out and bought the screws and other missing parts (the directions tell you the size of everything you were suppose to have in the box). He was able to put it together in no time and my 19 month old son loves it! It looks great and is very sturdy. Unfortunately my husband will not order baby furniture items on-line again."
2,damaged beyond belief,"I had the exact same model a few years back for my oldest boy which I ordered thru Target via Amazon. Quite satisfied, I reordered the same for my second boy. It arrived in awful condition badly gouged and damaged, scraped and banged up. The damage was from the warehouse and not delivery as the outer package was in perfect shape. The inconvenience of returning this bulky item which already took close to three weeks to arrive, is more then I wished to contend with but would advise to anyone considering ordering this online to be cautious as yours too may arrive terribly damaged. I gave this two stars as it is very functional, economical and when not so terribly damaged, very cute....thankfully my three year old is unaware of the cosmetic damage and enjoys his 'big boy' bed."
1,Completely underwhelmed!,"The cover says ""...everything necessary to recreate the relaxing sound of rippling water wherever it's most needed, whether at home, at work, or on the road."" Like the other reviewer, I was unimpressed by this ""water garden"". I got six tiny pebbles that don't cover the bottom of the small plastic cup, and it certainly doesn't ""recreate the relaxing sound of water"". I'm sorry to say the sound created most closely resembles a short, wet fart. Not recommended."
3,18 Volt Adapter,Wasn't what I thought it was. It didn't work for what I needed. I'm sure one day I can use it for something.
1,Yawn.....ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz,"If I didn't have to read this book for school I wouldn't have read past the first chapter. It's incerdibly boring and if you have not read ""The Crystal Cave"" you might be a little lost. (As I was) I would only recommend this book to readers who are extremely in love with Arthur's legend."
4,A Young Minds Review,"In The Hollow Hills, young Arthur Pendragon is waiting to become the next King of Britian. Young Arthur faces many adventures and hard tasks. With the great Merlin Ambrosius at his side he can not fail. But even he can not protect Arthur from his haunting dreams of Caliburn; the great magical sword that will lead the one who wields it to victory. When Uther Pendragon is killed in battle Arthur Pendragon becomes the new King of Britian. But only after he finds the great Caliburn."
5,the best Merlin book I've read (and I've read many),"This was just a great book. It deals with Merlin's childhood and his discovery of his magic and his heritage. If you are interested in Merlin as a person and how he came to be who he is, you should read this."
1,Major Rip Off - This is for ONE boot ONLY,"The current charge for this ONE boot (not a dozen, not 50, not a gross) is $7.06. I was actually charged more - they seem to have ***lowered*** the price. When I returned it outraged, I was charged shipping for the return which was deducted from my refund for this item that is worth about 17 cents per unit. Try CyberGuys instead! Caveat Emptor."
4,Works well - deet free - but a bit short on staying power,"My family and I have used this product in SE Alaska for roughly 5 years. I like that it has no DEET, and is still pretty effective. You may have to apply frequently in heavy conditions, but for most evenings around the yard/camping - a single covering will last several hours. We will continue to buy this product.We have heavy insect conditions up here, including no-see-ums, black flies, mosquitoes and white socks (which are vile biting creatures). This stuff has kept all of them from biting in most conditions (river fishing, camping, claming, playing on the beach or in the yard, hunting, etc.,) Although the bugs still buzz you, they do not bite for a while.Once, in a very heavy black fly and no-see-um attack (large swarms of bugs), I had to apply about every 45 minutes or so, but I was also sweating while working up fish, and getting lots of fish slime on me, whiping sweat (and product) from my brow..."
5,High quality at a good price!,These powerstrips are well made and affordable. I like them much better than other brands at a similar price point. It looks like they will last a very long time and they seem to made of high quality materials including the switch.
4,Good book,Its a good book if you are adding it to the main course.Can find additional practice item.I do not think English changes much over the years so edition does not matter much.
2,Interesting but not World History,"Originally published in 1890 and clearly dated with a Euro-Christian view. It starts in the garden of Eden in 4004 BC. No mention of archeological finds from the past century like Mohenjo-Daro or Catalhyuk. No mention of south Asia, Southeast Asia or the Americas.Try ""The Timetables of History"" by Grun; not quite as visually stunning, but a lot more accurate."
5,Wall Chart of World History,"This is such a cool book. It helps to put everything happening today into perspective, as one realizes that human history is so long, and that all the achievements of the 20th & 21st centuries are as only a minute in the history of humans.Great decoration, too, if you spread it out all the way."
1,Wallchart of World History.,"I have yet to receive it!!! Should have gotten it between Dec. 7th and 24th. Still not here! Got an email stateing it was shipped, quite a while ago.I really wanted this book, sad it hasn't arrived.Cindy Zinzer"
3,Mailer as Literary Critic Intrigues,"There is much to argue with in ""The Prisoner of Sex"", and though I'm in sympathy with the aims of the womens' movement, I cheer Mailers' defense of the artists right to use their sexuality and sense of the sensual world as proper fodder for poetic expression.There are times when Mailer- the- mystic clogs up an otherwise lacerating arguement,where his romanticism veers dangerously towards a lunatics hallucinations, but his defense of Miller, Lawrence and Genet against the clumsier moments of Millets' orginal critique in ""Sexual Politics"" is literary criticism at its most emphatic.""Prisoner of Sex"" is, I'm afraid, incoherant at times, but there are long passages of rich knock-out prose that demonstrate why Mailer is thought by many to be one of the premiere stylists of the times, and if nothing else, his lyrical defense of D.H.Lawrence is worth the purchase by itself."
2,"Love you guys, but PLEASE fix commentaries!","For whatever reason, the commentaries recorded on every season of The Guild's dvds are terrible in terms of the audio. You simply cannot hear half the people's commentaries on any of them - this one included.Look, I give The Guild as a series 5 stars - every single season is hilarious and biting and so, so much fun. But I buy the dvds for the extras, especially the commentaries! I want to hear what ALL of them are saying, and you just can't. It's so frustrating.Like I wrote in a review of the first 2 seasons, it's a damn shame that we are missing out on what these people are saying because with this group of talented actors, writers and directors, you just KNOW they are being hilarious.Felicia! We love you, and everyone on The Guild! Please invest in decent mics for everyone participating in the commentaries!!!"
1,Doesn't work!!,"This adapter did not work in my Jeep Wrangler 2003 - it plugged in but I could not get reception on the radio. I bought a different one from WalMart and then my new stereo worked just fine. Since the product is not in its original packaging and they deduct for shipping etc., what was the point in trying to return it? Waste of $$."
4,hysterical,"true equality: makes fun of EVERYONE. Lots of laughs, many bittersweet, but it hits the mark. I really enjoyed it."
2,RESEARCH ON THE MAIN THEMES,"Iam looking for help to study the main themes (death, African influence,..) of The Cattle Killing. please help me."
3,"Should not be listed under ""Christian"" books","While this book might be very helpful to individuals of many faiths and spiritualies, it is not Bible-based and should not be included in the category of other Christian books. I was expecting to see Bible verses, not referrences to ""the Higher Power"". The description I read for this book didn't indicate it was written specifically for Overeaters Annonymous. Why not? I think it would be helpful for those in OA searching on line to have that information. Still, the readings are well-written and thought-provoking and there is good, moral advice for daily living. Christians will be better served by other authors using the Scriptures for their meditations."
1,I agree with the BikieDiva,"Her expressions were almost as if she were in pain. It made me think that she was somewhat of a bad dancer but I have seen other videos of her on you tube and she dances quite well sometimes.But in this, she danced very sloppily as if she were a beginner trying to do advanced moves. She was not always on beat and she sometimes struggled to give accurate instructions. I don't know what was going on here but I wish I never spent money on this DVD. I threw it away after I watched it the whole way through. She HAS to look back at this DVD and regret it. It should be taken off the market."
2,Tray is worthless,"I purchased this chair for use at the grandparent's house when we travel, and it does fine for that purpose. I don't use the tray anymore though, because it falls off when my toddler leans on it, and she is small for her age. It works fine to push her up to the table though."
4,A Piece of My Childhood,"What a thrill to see the Betsy-Tacy-Tib books once more in publication! I read this series over and over throughout my childhood and loved each one. Driving through Mankato, MN was like going through history after reading this saga."
3,Decent but not great 3.5 out of 5,"If they didn't have the slow tracks Barabas and Another Sun (and has some more upbeat tracks instead) I would have liked this more. Nonetheless this album does have a few great tracks on it that makes it worth having. The Iron Mask, Master of Madness, Black Magic Castle, The Fight and Metallic Tragedy are the best on the album in my opinion. Check out this band, they're worth it."
5,"Good Buy - Also Get the rest of the ""Consistent Tennis Wins"" 8 DVD Series","Tom Avery doesn't over-complicate things, nor does he oversimplify them. You can't wait to apply what you've learned!I have the whole 8 DVD series of his called, ""Consistent Tennis Wins"".These DVDs deal with the:ServeReturn of ServeBackhandAbility to SwingNet PlaySingles & Doubles TipsSpecialty Shots (lobs, slice, etc) and theOriginalIt costs more than others, because you get what you pay for!"
5,Film Noir at it's best..,"Being a fan of film noir for years, I am biased and think that any film noirhas some value. This vol. 3 package is just as good as the first two and evenmore important, because it presents films that had little or no critical review or response... And, now that there is some revival of the value andsignificant insights that were inherent in film noir, these films in this vol. adds to that knowledge and perhaps more fans......."
3,Not so much daily lives,"My real interest in this book was to learn how ordinary people coped with life in a great depression. What interests me is in finding out how certain parts of society experienced it as I am sure the impact varies greatly.This book - despite its title - clearly fails to answer this. Sure it tells me some of the reasons around the boom and bust, and some statistics on unemplyment, etc. But what I really wanted was the 'how they lived their lives' aspect that the title and blurb teased me with.Despite my annoyance, I can't give this a 1 star (which is what it is worth to me) since it is a well written book and covers the topic well."
4,Worthwhile History,"Kyvig gives us a straightforward, clear history of two vital decades in U.S. history. The Twenties and Thirties set the stage for later decades and Kyvig tells us how and why. He manages to cover just about every imaginable facet of life in those decades, large and small. This is a simple and enjoyable book -- necessary if one is to fully understand the whys and wherefores of the U.S. today."
4,"Good (hard to find) details, repetitive","If you are interested in the day-to-day and mundane parts of life from the 20s-40s, this is a good place to start. One thing this book does really well is differentiate between different geographic/economic areas. On multiple occasions, I'd be reading about some aspect of city life (use of electricity, automobiles, wages, etc), and I'd be thinking ""I wonder if it was the same in the rural areas,"" then BAM, the author would answer my question.Another review said the book is general, and I guess that may be the case, but it gives a nice sweeping overview of pretty much everything you'd want to know.My only caveat with this book is that it got a little repetitive at times and some language was awkward. I'm guessing it could have used a bit of editing."
4,"Life as it was back then, not as we chose/like/want to remember it","It's very easy to be lulled into thinking that life in the 1920s and 30s was the way it's portrayed in the movies. And perhaps it was. But everything in a movie (or TV show) must first serve the story. Being accurate to history sits lower on the priority list. So it's always good to have reliable sources, like books such as this one, to tell us what life was really like. This book is readable and informative, without being glib or overly scholarly and serves as a fine introduction for anyone who wants to know more about this endlessly fascinating time. Recommended."
4,History might repeat itself,Combined with the Forgotten Man this is book offers the reasons to fight not to let the American economy fall into the mess of the 30's and 40's. Just sitting around waiting to be saved is no answer. Knowledge and then action to prevent the situations described in the book are necessary.
3,Take it or leave it,"I guess the title says it all. I was excited to get started reading this book because Lynn Bulock has been on my Amazon recommendations list for so long. Well, it started out okay, but it never really picked up. The characters seemed pretty simple to me. Tallie was the nice outgoing newcomer in town. She just had a way of drawing people to her. Ken was the brooding bar owner with baggage that he couldn't get past. They become close, then in a moment of misunderstanding Ken accuses Tallie of something she didn't do. I bet you can guess how the story ends. If you're looking for a quick easy read without much depth this might be the book for you. If you're looking for a great story, personable characters, or something to peak your interest keep looking."
3,Good kit but the wrong one.,"Amazon advertises the 1200-TK1 but twice they shipped me the 1200-TRK1 which is a ratchet head rebuild kit. I returned the first one and explained why I was returning it, and Amazon promptly sent me another wrong kit. I would expect they would check the part number the second time around. In the end, I returned the second kit and gave up. I will try and obtain the correct kit from someone else."
2,"good, but not essential","This movie guide covers a lot of ground, unfortunately not very well. While it is better than the first edition (in which Stanley felt compelled to make a bad joke about EVERY SINGLE FILM) and the entries often lack essential information (running time, director, cast), I keep this around because it sometimes lists some REALLY obscure films no one else mentions. If you're an unrepentant movie nut and can find a cheap copy, okay...."
2,"overall poor quality product, buy a better one","I bought this product about a year ago. After about three months, it wouldn't ""dock"" correctly, because the prongs where it docks had sunk into the docking piece. I was able to open up the dock piece and put some folded up paper in it so that the prongs stuck out enough for me to dock my Treo. Every now and then I have to jiggle it so the paper gets realigned.After about four months, the AC plug fell apart. Like I can see all the wires and everything inside. Well, they used to be inside. Now they just hang all over the place. It's especially annoying because the cord is short, so they are in the way.I've been able to jury-rig it so that it still works, but it is just a complete pain in the neck. I would spend a few more dollars and buy a better quality one (with longer cords) than this, if I were you. Actually, I am going to spend some extra now, since I am buying a replacement for the one I own!"
4,Daria on DVD: FINALLY!!,"This television series is one of the all time best. The DVD includes episode introductions for at least some of the episodes by Daria herself. The only remotely negative comment I have is what prevented this series from coming out on DVD, all of the scene transition music. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but for at least the first season, all of the recognizable music has been taken out and some ""transition"" music has been inserted in its place. You hardly even notice. In fact, forget I said anything. If you loved Daria before, you'll love her again.It's worth every penny!"
4,Daria DVDs,The case the DVDs came in was cracked. It arrived in only a bubble envelope with no other cushion wrapped around it. Other than that the product arrived promptly and was watchable.
5,The classics of my time--relived!,"I was so excited to see this DVD series for sale. I just wish that they would have made more seasons or even new seasons in 2012! I dearly miss this show because the quality of the stories were so believable and helped people realize certain things like dad can cook, mom can work crazy hours, and ultimately, women can be intelligent and strong. We need more programming like this--especially nowadays. You don't see many strong female roles on Mtv anymore in any of their shows. It is such a shame. It almost seems as though someone took over the television station and destroyed everything it had going for it in the early 1990s to later 1990s :(Another bonus to the DVD collection is that there are ""Daria Day intros"" to some of the episodes which is totally hilarious!"
1,Holding out,"This is still one of my favorite animated shows of all time. In fact I am watching it right now. Fortunately I am watching with the original music in tact. I have had a home made DVD collection for a while now and was so excited when I heard that it was being released in DVD quality. I was disappointed though when I read that the fantastic music of the 90's would not be included. Why would the artists not want their songs to live on through one of the most beloved clever series of our generation? Although I would love to own this box set I would rather it be in its entirety. Eventually they will release a ""directors cut"" or what have you. If they are smart that is. As my title says I am holding out."
4,Daria Returns,"Overall I am impressed with this package. The designs and packaging are cool, the show is still amazing. Really the only downside is the licensed music issue, but in reality it had been so long since I had seen this show that I didn't really notice I was missing out on anything."
5,Excellent documentary,"If you love Ben Franklin you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD. It's much shorter than the PBS version, but I think thats an advantage because it allows people who aren't interested in Franklin to get an understanding of just how important he was in American independence.I've showed it to friends who aren't at all interested in Franklin or History and they all were impressed not only with the DVD, but surprised that Franklin did so much in his lifetimeI highly recommed this DVD"
2,Biased agenda skews reality and truth,"Though I ache for those individuals who are in any way abused, and indeed appreciate this forum, which allows them to share their story (in a hopefully therapeutic manner), I caution readers to read with an open mind, recognizing that it is not the culture, but the individual members, who abuse. Abuse in any form must be stopped. But to say that polygamy is abuse (between consenting adults) is to abrogating freedom. I would encourage the readers to also read the book ""Voices in Harmony,"" which presents the stories of women who live in plural marriage. There are two sides to every issues. In some way, plural marriage was indeed approved by the God of the Old Testament. But I agree that it's a life which is only for those who choose it. There were a few typos in the book. It was a quick read, and I would recommend it as long as it is read in conjunction with the book above."
1,Not a cookbook I would have in my kitchen,"I received this book, looked through it and returned it the next day. I am low carbing but there was not one recipe I would use. The idea of pork rinds in my daily meals is revolting. I also limit fat. What a disappointment It is not remotely healthy eating."
1,Doesn't Work on Windows 7,"The Linksys WPSM54g does not work on 64 bit Windows 7 and is not supported by Linksys on Windows 7 at all. The official link from Linksys is that their engineers are working on driver, check back with their web site. But if they don't have support for Windows 7 by now, it is highly unlikely they ever will.There are a variety of informal guides for setting the print server on Windows 7; none work on 64 bit Windows 7, and, of course, none are backed up by the manufacturer.Life is too short to waste time trying to reverse engineer a product sold -- but orphaned -- by its manufacturer. Buy something else."
4,Wireless Printing,"I was in need of accessing my HP laser attached to my desktop to print from my and my wife's laptops. I had shared the printer on the desktop so we could print to it through our home network. However this entailed having to have the desktop on all the time to access the printer, wasting energy and using up the usefull life on the desktop's components; hard drive, etc.The laserjet is a few years old, does not have wireless capability, but is very reliable. One solution was to install a wireless printing devise. After researching the internet I settled on the Linksyk Wireless G Print Server. The instructions are clear and presise. It took me about an hour to install the hardware and software on the desktop and laptops. Everything worked as promissed. I am very happy with this solution. This is a great devise for the home, offices, home offices, etc."
1,Does not work on Vista 64bit,"Works great on main desktop PC. After trying to install on additional desktop running Vista Home Premium 64 Bit received an immediate error that the print server does not support Vista 64 Bit. I called Linksys Tech support and answer was ""We are aware of problem, but have no solution"". I will return the print server and look elsewhere....."
2,"Works well, but read on regarding default printer selection","The unit works well, even with a Belkin pre-N wireless router, tight security settings, and MAC filtering. Range is good, and it properly handles multifunction printer/scanners like the Dell 924.HOWEVER, beware that the software drivers for your computer DEMAND that the computer attached to this unit be the DEFAULT printer. You have no choice; if you change the default printer, the software will change it back to the one connected to this device.The only way around it is to RENAME the connected printer. Then, when you want to use it again, you have to name it BACK to the software-recommended name...it won't work unless it's named exactly the same thing as it was.Other than that silly software design, it works.Good documentation....just no way around that feature."
2,Not supported with vista,Would not install drivers on Windows Vista Laptop. Linksys wont support this either and blew me off
5,"easy setup, works perfectly",I just recieved and installed the Linksys Wireless-G PrintServer WPMSM54G. Install took 30 minutes following the step-by-step instructions included on the CD and copied in the manual. Had no issues. Installed successfully the first time. Documents print as expected with wireless connection. Printer is a Canon ImageClass D320.
1,"Works, but only when it feels like it.","I've had this thing for about 2 months and tomorrow I'm replacing it with another brand. It's INCREDIBLY slow when printing (reduced my printer's output rates by about 75%). Worse yet, sometimes it just won't allow one of the computers accessing it to print. No reason, it just won't connect to that computer. It's often better in the morning (who knows why). I've become very handy at unplugging the USB cable from the printserver and plugging it directly into the front of my computer when it does this. I've tried troubleshooting--it appears not to be releasing from the last computer that accessed it. Later this week I'll post a YouTube video of me lighting it on fire in my backyard. Do yourself a favor--buy another brand."
1,Not compatible with Windows 7,"This product only operates with Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Windows 7 has been the offering for nearly a year, and the product does not support it. Please be warned!!"
3,A good concept that needs some work.,"One reviewer recently gave some advice saying if you want wireless printing, buy a wireless printer... I'm beginning to believe that theroy. This print server was very easy to setup, I was amazed at how simple the setup procedure was. My problem started after setup...Issues -1. The software forces the printer connected to this server to be the default printer, if you switch your default printer it will be changed back to the printer connected to this server.2. The print speed becomes painfully slow when connected to the print server. I tried this with three different printers and each printer was slow, took over one minute to print one page.3. You can only connect one printer, it would be nice to have multiple printers connected.4. And last, but not least, you cannot use it as an access bridge to connect a wired computer.I was hoping for something better, but I'm not sure that exists...yet."
4,Once installed this works great,"this was very tricky to install, but, once properly installed, and firmware updated I can print and scan on my HP all in one from any computer in the house"
3,Works fine with windows 7 if you get past the installation bug,"The installation software takes a long time - over an hour. There is also an inexcusable bug during that process - When you are asked to enter the WEP key, don't. Hit next and you'll be asked again on the next screen. That's when you should put it in.If you can get past these two issues the print server will work with windows 7 (32 bit) just fine.The nice thing is that with all the problems people are having installing this thing there are a fair number of refurbished units around that can be had for next to nothing. Even new the price is very reasonable."
4,Nice product. Works as expected,"I bought this to replace a non-functional Netgear router that had stopped working after 3 years. The set up was a bit more than I think it should have been, but not too bad."
1,Not Compatible with XP Service Pack 3,"I just spent 3 hours with tech support and was finally informed that this unit is not supported by XP SP3.They are working on compatibility problems with another product, thus this is not on the current queue for upgrade.EXTREMELY disappointing support from a company such as cisco."
1,Poor documentation,"The LinkSys Wireless-G Printserver does not work with 64 bit VISTA. Of course, nothing on Amazon nor on the Linksys website indicate this. The advertisment that this works with VISTA seems to be a weak statement, in lieu of what I just typed!! Do not buy this if you have 64 bit VISTA!!"
3,"Works with XP, no drivers for Vista yet","Installed it for a driend at his hose, with a Dell multifunction. It DOES work, it is quirky though ... and there are no vista drivers, which is highly suprising, since it has just been released."
1,Do not buy,"This product did not work as advertised with Canon pixma mp780 and a desktop running Windows 2000. Worst customer support I have ever dealt with. I will never buy another linksys product and Amazon should consider ending relationship with this atrocious company.After spending several hours with technical support and on hold, we were never able to get a single test page to print out. Installation would always fail after trying to load drivers."
3,Readable but not scientific,"This is easy to read but only gives one side of the nature/nurture controversy. It comes down hard on the nature side and limits itself to the evolutionary hypothesis. There are other theories about physical attractiveness. It fails to distinguish between what is said to be attractive and what causes sexual rousal. It offers no solution to the problem of ""lookism"" or ""appearancism."" After reading Grealy's ""Autobiography of a Face"" one feels that we should at least be discussing solutions. To be fair, the scientific studies are surprisingly few and surprisingly dull. Read this book and also read Grealy and Wolf ( ""The Beauty Trap"")"
1,"look up a photo of the author, HOLY PLASTIC SURGERY","i would also like to add that although i am short, and do not have the right measurements or the right hair color, i can still sleep with any guy i want, and that by no means makes me better than any one elseto compare beauty to breeding is ridiculous. just because a man would like to sleep with a female doesnt mean he finds her attractive. i know because most men who want to sleep with him would never want to be in a real relationship with me, and the same goes for several other ""beautiful women""when it comes to settling down, most men chose the plain jane."
5,great book,"Not only was this book SO informative, but as someone who studies the psychology and sociology of beauty and modern women, I really appreciated the thorough research and thought that went into the book. I highly recommend this to just about anyone with an open mind and a willingness to learn about the truths of our time."
1,"If I were you, I woud'nt buy this book","I regret buyning this book, because It's made in poor material and its contents has much less than what I was expecting. It is really more expensive than it should cost. If you need a good book in this subject, don't spend your money with this one. Buy another."
2,Not the greatest - but has its uses,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a cheap, sub-standard book. BUT it is a photocopy of the ORIGINAL manuscript held at the British Museum. I think it is a bit overpriced, but found it useful to compare the actual scribe's writing and drawings with other editions of the Lemegeton. The transcription by White is erroneous in several places if you compare the handwriting of an obscure word with others that are not so obscure the style the scribe wrote the letters becomes apparent (A's, O's, E's, F's and S's seem to be the most problematic). Hope this helps you in your decision."
5,the original manuscripts from British museums,A must for the seriious student of classical occultism. The complete manuscripts from witch the more common key of solomn and the goetia are taken.
4,Nice Texture/Taste,Good product with a truly sweet taste. The potato was a bit heavier texture than what we've experienced with other Ener-G Foods muffins. We may try them again.
3,...it could use a little more cowbell.,"I just got the dvd and it has to be the worst. The film quality is low, and the guy has a fever for more cowbell. Beware before you buy, definitely not for rock nor metal."
4,Great looking chair!,"I purchased one of these at the seller's website for my home office and I'm really pleased with it. It's great looking to say the least - for only $99 I wasn't expecting much. I get a lot of compliments on it, and it seems pretty durable. I've had it for a few months now and it doesn't show any unexpected signs of wear. It's comfortable too. The adjustable back pad is handy - I just moved mine to the bottom of the back and it provides the right amount of support where I need it."
5,Annie,"History again is very important in life. San Quentin was quite a show. Peison life is not something anyone should want to experience. But of course, bcause of the era many men n women felt desperate. The movie shows manipulation from cellmates, guards, and how honesty with integrity has no meaning. Humphrey Bogart was a fine man in his time. I am glad to have met him through the screen."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I don't know hy I bought this movie. I wish I didn't. I guess I was hoping to see beatiful lesbian vampires. Well, none of them are beautiful. The erotic scenes suck. There is no horror at all.Stay away from this movie."
4,Solves our problems.,"I bought this because I knew we'd be encountering some female-female or male-male issues when building our tracks. It was definitely a good buy. HOWEVER, I didn't look closely enough at the picture when I bought this. I thought I'd be getting two pieces with two female ends (which was correct) and two pieces with two male ends (which was WRONG). For some reason, this only includes one piece with two male ends. Instead of a second one of those, they throw in a male-female piece. I don't really know why they do that; it's kind of a waste of money in my case, since I got a ton of those smaller pieces in a bulk track set I bought. But this is still worth it; I just have to make sure I only have one instance where I'll have to use the male-male piece. Not too big of an issue. This connects perfectly with the ""100 Piece Bulk Wooden Train Track"" I bought here, and our Chuggington cars work well on everything."
3,Somewhat Amusing Twist on Old Idea,"While the author did get a few chuckles out of me, I'm afraid the concept of wacky letters sent to companies has already been done, several times over, and his twist wasn't quite fresh enough to wow me. (In fact, my husband recalls that in the 70s or 80s someone had done the exact same thing with cover letters.) Certainly there was some charm and humor in the one where he asks his father if he can pay him for chores, but I think, for example, the Paul Rosa books and certainly Don Novello's ""Lazlo Letters"" were a bit sharper, and their inclusion of actual corporate responses does give them more of an edge."
4,All the Hits,"For young readers not yet ready to tackle Homer in translation this prose version is a superb introduction to the epic's most stirring episodes. McCaughrean writes in an alliterative prose which honors the poetry of the original. She pumps new life into the tangle with the Cyclops, the lure of the Sirens, and the final smackdown on Ithaca when a weathered Odysseus teaches the loutish suitors a thing or two. Seventh graders here have really warmed to this commendable retelling. Our ancient history curriuculum has certainly benefitted from its inclusion."
1,Not the odyssey,Expecting an 800 page epic to keep me reading whilst working at a summer camp in the USA I recieved a copy of this which is aimed at 12 year old kids. Very unimpressed !
4,twisted fun,"It amazes me how a 30 year old movie can still shock you. Drag Queens making out with ""straight"" guys? way ahead of its time.the movie is hilarious and dark at the same time. Candy Darling looks flawless, Holly Woodlawn looks scary and Jackie Curtis is just a mess.DP work is a bit mediocre ( thanks to the mastermind of this project: Warhol himself) and editing could be better. Seeing Holly Woodlawn molesting beautiful Jane Forth is priceless though!Overall a movie about an era and a scene long gone but very much missed...."
5,Stanley Booth Penned a Classic,"Stanley Booth not only wrote the best book ever written about the Stones, but the best book ever written about Rock and Roll period. If ""Exile on Main St."" was a book, it would be this. The book is a rich tapestry of layers and textures. A must read. Please pay special attention to the chapter that takes place in Sam Sheffler's basement on Hudson Ave. It is filty yet fun."
5,"Fine movie, nice storyline. Very good acting by all actors.","Fine movie, nice storyline. Very good acting by all actors.The human emotions of parental love and a child's feelings are exquisitely highlighted and portrayed by the actors.Must see for mothers and fathers who have a girl child."
5,Outstanding ending! And hope for more to follow!,"This whole series has been outstanding. I've come to know it as an over 40 mother of a 7 year old and have been completely impressed with the whole series - I think I was more excited waiting for this installment than my son was. I was sad thinking this would be the end but the very last minute left the hope that more could follow, The series is much more than just martial arts, though it handles that very well - it's about character development and inter-relationships - it has serious plot development carried through from beginning to end. Every dvd has been pre-ordered and I can recommend the whole series highly enough for both adults and children."
4,Amusing wildernes stories and a message of utmost importance,"There is a message of utmost importance in this book that is told through amusing stories of adventure into the wilderness: Only if we carefully preserve the trouts extended habitat can we continue to pursue wild trout. Take one or maybe two fish and flavor them. Leave the rest behind and enjoy the wilderness where they are raised. Before you return home, make sure you leave everything around you like it was when you first got there!"
2,very disappointing,"I had high expectations of this book, based on having read the author's Wrinkle in Time and on the other reviews here. But this was a dreadful book. The plot is predictable, the characterizations flat--especially Maggy is completely unengaging and implausible. And the moralizing is very obvious. Maybe I've just read too many children's books about orphans, fostering and adoption, but this one wouldn't even make it onto my list of the top 25 books with that theme."
3,ok i guess,"the texture is fine and feels good when you apply it. However, it did not really solve the problem for me. I have to apply it all the time to keep lips soft"
4,Don't Judge Based on Reviewers,"If you liked both of the previous The Used cds, I would recommend checking out this one. To me it sounds like a bit different than their previous CD's, but it still sounds like The Used.Everyone's musical taste is different. So you simply can't buy on a review alone. I'd recommend sampling some of the songs online (I know they have a bunch on Myspace). But don't let a review sway you one way or another. It could be your next favorite album or it could be crap (to you).Also, I bought mine at Best Buy. Mine includes 13 tracks, instead of the listed 11. I think its a ""Best Buy exclusive"". So you minute want to shop around to make sure you are getting the most for your money."
2,Not her best work by far,"I was a little disappointed in this book, truth be told. Perhaps I am once again becoming a little weary of the typical romance storyline and expect more. Perhaps it was the seeming cheesiness of the entire ""Vanza"" society (doesn't that just sound phony?). Perhaps I just didn't quite buy into the characters, though I really did like Ambrose. But Concordia was just a little too ""modern,"" and the whole idea of the hippie commune at that time seemed a bit of a stretch. All that being said, as far as romance novels go, it wasn't that bad. There were a few lines that made me chuckle, and the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. I'd say it's worth your time if you enjoy romance novels, just don't go in expecting anything too deep and meaningful."
5,For those of us that likes a spicy read ...,"A must read. This fast paced novel will have you anxiously turning pages long past bedtime. Characters are enduring. Natural dialog, sensible storyline and satisfying conclusion. What more could a discerning reader ask for? This is a well written novel.Janet Sue Terry - CEOJMB BOOK PUBLISHING COMPANYwww.jmbpub.comAuthor of Contemporary Romance Novels ""Possibilities,"" and ""Resolutions,"" as well as, ""Just Our Best Short Stories 2005."""
5,KathyJ,I enjoy anything written by Amanda Quick/Jayne Castle /Jayne AnnKrentz - I love that the women are strong headed and outspoken. There's always and element of suspense/surprise in her books.
3,Okay for kids.,My daughter really liked this movie. She is eight. It is an older movie and is definitely for kids. It is probably not something that you'd want to sit down and watch over and over with your child though.
1,Teaching our kids to smoke?,"I think Sherlock is a horrible movie for kids. Why would I want my kids to learn how to smoke? My daughter now thinks our dog talks, which is annoying. ""Dad why isn't Muffin talking to me?"". This movie is also a 99 cent stores, so save your money if you really must buy this movie. Also the little kid in the movie doesnt seem like he takes many showers. Very dirty child."
2,Office 2000 User Specialist Study Guide,"The book (Overall) is a fair book to use as a study guide..BUT in several areas you are not given the correct subject matter to study. Word Expert for example is missing several KEY topics, or they are missed labeled.Main topics for other MOUS test study are good, I feel a better research job needs to be done, there are other books out there that cover the subject(s) much better.To me it is NOT worth the price (for what you get out of it).As the book ""states"" it is a study guide. Would be nice if indeed it was."
4,Works as expected,Was exactly what I thought it would be and a fair price. Its a piece of aluminum not much more to say.
3,"Porn(!), a few laughs, but not much else","The three episodes of this series are told in video-game format, so everything plays out as ""quest has been given: go save the naked maidens!"" (although the whole show's not like that, thankfully). Plot is kept to somewhat of a repetitive minimum, but as a hentai, it can be rather... well, different. It obviously has its moments, but it's not all that great. I'd suggest renting (although I have yet to know of a place to rent from) or downloading the eps, because this just doesn't have enough there for purchasing."
2,A little bit of what you might look for from this...,"It's a story of four travelers existing in a dungeons and dragons type of world. They fight monsters, sleep at inns, and well, have sex. Most likely anyone who would buy this tape would be looking to buy it for it's erotic content and that's about all the value it has. The story isn't worth paying attention to. Even if you were just looking for the erotic stuff, there is not quite enough to make you feel like it was worth paying the money for. Overall, it has some merit and it not that bad to have, but there are better buys out there..."
4,A perfect workout watch,"This is a good looking watch that so far has performed well. I only ran into one problem that has somehow worked itself out and that was for some reason whatever the day or time was, the watch would reset to Saturday at like 1:00am. That was kind of weird but it only did that twice. If it happens again I'll probably return it. Overall, a nice-looking watch and the indiglo being yellow is very cool."
1,Disappointed,"I've always loved this show and have been gradually purchasing the DVDs. I noticed that some of the songs were different in earlier seasons, and although a scene or two was ruined because of it, it wasn't anything too terrible. But this season is another story. There are songs that are different, and some that are just cut out. Even scenes are cut out, and some are interrupted in the middle and then the end is just sort of attached, which makes it very confusing if you haven't seen it before. Now I'm unsure if I ought to bother purchasing anymore seasons because it's such a waste of money. Although I do have the last season, and it seems to be intact- so I probably will take the chance. I hate it when shows cut things up like this. It's worse than watching it on TV with commercials."
5,Beverly Hills 90210,I love all characters show!! It may help for the teenagers and young adult to live in a right way to deal of life! Right now I have Sixth of all. Looking forward to get them all. I will hand them to my kids when they get older to look out for their lives and maybe more maturities. It is excellent shows!! Thank you!
5,Listen kinsey,"Bratz dolls are the best dolls in the universe. Go kiss the My Scene dolls big butt and boobs for all I care. My Scene dolls are nothing but a pile of crap. Bratz dolls are the best dolls in the universe. And they always will. Listen you no good My Scene fan, go away and leave the best dolls in the world alone, the Bratz dolls. Anyways, This is one of the best movies i hve ever seen. It is awsome. I have it and I love it."
4,"Survival is an Option, Failure is NOT.","While it was interesting seeing Superman and the Predator in a comic together, it was also kindof frustrating, because there wasn't anything 'super' about Superman in this comic.The storyline is very well thought out though. Because if Superman was on Earth, the Predator (I suppose) would DEFINETELY devise a way to deal with him if he were to try to get between them and their prey. In this comic the Predtor is destroying technology not hunting, so it isn't the Hunt that he is on, rather it is a mission to stop scientists from using his technology.All in all it was a good read for it's uniqueness and it has a few interesting points you learn about the Predator."
5,It now is very compact and works great.,"I play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass. I use this ECB003 adapter with a Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR volume boost stomp box. The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I separately ordered this 9-volt Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent. They obviously have changed the design, because the one they sent me is much more compact than the picture. In fact, at 1.5""x2.5""x1.25"" it is a match for the smallest wall-wart adapter I own. I don't see how it could be better. Perfect."
5,As Advertised,Bought this to power my Dunlop Crybaby from Hell and it works perfectly. Gives smooth even power to keep it giving that trademark sound at max power.
4,Good series of books,"I put off reading these books for years but found they are a great, fast read, more like Hornblower than Aubrey series.I think I equated the name Ramage with rampage and figured they were a cheap teen age rip off of the Hornblower books.I was wrong and was happy to find another good series on the life and times in the Royal British Navy at the turn of the 18thcentury.Don't be critical and just enjoy."
3,Could've been so much better than it is,"Joachim Koehler, at his best, writes well. So well, that it's a pity his book is marred by a NATIONAL ENQUIRER type of prurience, by wild unconvincing generalizations, and by an almost complete absence of interest in Wagner's actual music - which is, after all, the reason why Wagner matters today.Having discussed the present volume's virtues and failings at 2,000-word length in the February 14, 2005 AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE, I shall simply say here: this should've been the one-volume Wagner biography that all Wagnerians were longing for, but it isn't. Best to stick with the Wagnerological surveys of Bryan Magee, Rudolph Sabor, Deryck Cooke, and (more recently) Milton Bremer for greater insight than Koehler offers. The really hard-core Wagnerian will also want, within handy reach, Ernest Newman's four-volume account."
5,"Not Bad, Steel has a little Ring...","Not bad at all for a cheap set. Did the job, didnt mushroom. Good enough..."
4,Excellent Historical Adventure,"You know with Louis L'Amour that the historical information is going to be acurate. Great adventure story about Sitka an island of Alaska in a time when the Russia government still owned it. Jean LaBarge is a true adventure hero. L'Amour does an excellent job of describing everything in such great detail that you can visualize it. Plus a romance. Don't be scared off by the number of pages, it is worth it."
2,"item good,but battery replacement is bad","I have a DVD player, size of screen is good, it is heavy for traveling, now the battery is dead and there is not way to get a new one. I lost the remote control and same, there is not way to get a new one. If someone knows who sell this battery please email me"
4,"Two of a kind, in a box!","this is a great gift idea! it includes two of kind books #1. #2. and #3. and a bonus!: a mary-kate and ashley journal, to write down your thoughts. its a pretty good deal if you think about it! you get 3 books which are hard to find, and then the journal, which cant be bought in the stores! buy this! its *GREAT*"
3,Light-hearted fun,"Most of the girls can't really bowl but of course that's not what you're watching this video for. The girls are cute and seem to be having a lot of fun, and this gonzo element is, in my opinion, what sets Hot Body videos apart from many others. Personally I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more unscripted action in these videos, with the cameras rolling while we hear the girls chat more among themselves."
5,IT REALLY WORKS!!!,"I have struggled with weightloss for years, and lacked the discipline to accomplish it. This book makes it soooooo easy, all you do is follow the meal plans. I lost 35 lbs. and feel great....."
4,excellent western,I enjoyed this western and considered 5 stars. I look forward to his/her other works. Except for L'amore this may be my favorite western
1,Sean McFarland,"This was advertised as a Wii Remote BY NINTENDO. It was no such thing. It arrived wrapped in plasti, and had a very cheap feel. The word Nintendo was not on the remoate anywhere. Beware of the Bait and Switch tactics. Make sure you are buying the real thing."
4,Wii Controller,works great with the Wii Game system............looks and plays just like the one that came with the system.....
4,Standard WII Remote,"Nothing special, just the standard Wii remote with batteries and the jelly sleeve. Works well with our existing system and controllers."
3,not happy,Bought this remote from one of your sellers the Battery did not work had to buy new battery pack wrote to seller didn't get a new one
3,Good not great,The controller is good but when using the nun-truck with it it gets combersome even for storage. Sure you can get a wireless Nun-truck but it will cost you 100 dollars.
1,We Remote controller,"the controllers lasted just over 35 days and do not work at all, I recommend buying the orginal I just wanted them to work, They drain batteries rather fast and after day 36 with new batteries do not even turn on"
1,Poor Control; Frustrating controller,"This wii controller was packaged well and arrived without damage. However, its performance is less than ideal. The controller bounces around on the screen and is very frustrating to attempt to use. Would not recommend."
1,GARBAGE,"I purchased this on 10/12/2012, after the package was smashed and the manual was in another language so good luck with trying to read it, put in batteries, didn't work, tried other batteries still nothing, tried batteries from a working Wii remote and they still didn't work. This product is inferior, don't waste your money, buy the Nintendo Wii remote...Don't bother with this cheap overseas garbage. Sent back for refund on 10/16."
4,Wii Remote Controller,This product works perfectly. My sister was very excited to receive this as a gift.
5,wii remote controller,It works excellent and was delivered in a timely manner. The remote control was cheaper by $5.00 by ordering through Amazon than buying in local store.
5,Wii Remote Control,This remote controller is working beautifully. I am very pleased with it and also the quick delivery.
4,WII Remote Controller performance,"At first, the remote controller, acquired in early April of this year, worked fine and we were thoroughjly happy with it - HOWEVER,last week it suddenly failed in the middle of a game. Since, then, we got it to work once only, and now it doesn't seem to work at all. We are very disappointed and would like to either have it fixed, get another one, or have our money refunded. We don't know who to contact. Can anyone help?"
3,Works with PCs,"I bought this to experiment with in communicating with a PC. It works, but it's a tad flaky, being difficult to connect, and requiring a resync every time I want to mess with it.Still, it's very sensitive and relatively easy to code against."
3,Works great.... WAY overpriced,"If you want to play multi-player games like Mario Party, you need to get another remote or 2... or 3. They all work great... but they are WAY too expensive. Lucky for Nintendo... you have no other options."
5,Fun exercise,"This game gets me off the couch. Instead of sitting around watching TV. I get up and enjoy the activity of playing several different games. The Wii is great gaming machine, combining gaming and exercise."
2,You get what you pay for,"I received the controllers, and they came not with the box, but with a printed note wrapped around it, saying there was no box, and hence the cheap price. If I was getting these for myself, I wouldn't have minded, but these were a gift. They need to WRITE IN THE DESCRIPTION THAT THEY DO NOT COME NEW IN BOX. This will alert future buyers from being let down. Otherwise, the product is great."
2,Dissapointing...,"I stumbled across Emiliana Torrini's ""Love in the Time of Science"" by chance and absolutely loved it! It was hauntingly beautiful and the background music is a little reminiscent of Dido. ""Fisherman's Woman"" however, is a far cry from her first cd. When I listened to it, it literally put me in a trance, that's how bored I was. Every song sounds exactly the same! It's pretty much one big long song with her singing quietly. Add some guitar in the backround and vua` la` instant nap. The one redeeming song on the cd is ""Sunny Road"", but it's not worth the wasted time just to get to it. So my advice would be to just skip this one and go straight for her ""Love in the Time of Science."" Unless of course you're an insomniac and you need to get some sleep, because this might help. If you like Emiliana Torrini, you may also like Rie Sinclair, Dolores O'Riordan, and A Fine Frenzy."
2,Beautiful voice but disappointed.,"When I purchased this album I expected something much more similar to ""Love in the Time of Science"" her 1st album. This is too mellow even for my wife. It reminds me of when Natalie Merchant left the 10,000 Maniacs. She had a cool voice too but it needed some good musical accompaniment. I realize recording artists have to change their sound here and there but this was too much."
3,"great voice, intriguing lyrics","She has a great voice and her phrasing is interesting but the songs all sound very similiar. While I liked the album, and the song Sunny Road the best, other songs were not as memorable."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a great, affordable 5-button mouse. This one worked right off the bat--once I plugged it in. I was surprised that it came with a floppy disk with the drivers on it---who even USES floppys anymore!? I was able to dl drivers off the website though, so that wasn't a big deal. My biggest disappointment with this mouse is the fact that it is SOOOOO jumpy! It skips ALL over the place, and that is REALLY annoying. For this ONE reason, a very big one (to me), I rate it at a 2."
5,WOW!,"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The characters are phenominal and you really feel like you are a part of the story. Never a dull moment! I reccomend it to people who like planes, and anyone in for a good book!"
3,Watch out for the sizing,"These shoes are great if not for getting the wrong size, as I now find out. I ordered a half size bigger than what I normally wear, so when these arrived yesterday, I tried them on. I ordered Size 7.5 M (US) which is what I order for CLARKS, and these shoes fit are smaller. Other than the fit, I really like the look of the shoes as well as the quality of the leather used to make it, so I do hope I can exchange the ones I received for a size that fits better. If these fit, I am sure I would be quite happy with them. Just be aware that the size as posted can either run a half size larger or smaller. Mine was the latter.I will change or put up another review for this once this is resolved."
2,strong chemical odor/ sizes not consistent,Softspots Women's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe. It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem. The shoes wear well and are comfortable. This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly. It was so tight I could not get it on. I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug. These shoes have a strong chemical odor. I have aired them for a week with no improvement. The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage. I may have to return these shoes too.
5,Great Treasure,I remember this book from when I was very young. It is such a great story for the imagination. A journey waiting to be read to an adventurous child!!!
2,Its OK,this show features some great comedians but put together they just dont make it in the scetch comedy world
3,"Great Literature, But Not a Good Story Well Told","A novel of intricate characterizations of a huge number of participants in a bureaucracy, Guard of Honor would probably appeal more to lovers of Great Literature than to lovers of a Good Story Well Told. It is a very long and detailed book. What plot there is involves attempts of some of the lead characters to avoid doing the morally-correct action. Few characters are likeable; few have much integrity. The author likes very long sentences; many paragraphs are absolutely incomprehensible. The ending was quite unsatisfactory to me. However, all those characters are distinctive and memorable - not a small achievement. And, the author certainly understands the dynamics of a bureaucracy. The book is enjoying a small revival due to a rave review in the American Scholar magazine."
5,This is not your grandmother's soul cooking. It's better!,"Delicious, beautifully photographed, to die for food. This book raises the standard for soul food cooking to another level. Fine dining and comfort food have joined together in a marriage of gourmet love."
1,"NOT GOOD AT ALL, if you want southern cooking....","go for Frank Stitt's Southern Table which is what a real Southern cooking book should be. This book is very pretty, but not well written. It's simply kitschy, and the recipes are not good at all. I made several things from this book, and they did not work. I would not advise buying this book. I'm sorry, but Tanya Holland is not a 'real' chef, maybe one of those many people who write cookbooks and put in pretty pictures to sell it. Just my personal opinion."
1,Rudy Sarzo,"He may be able to play the instrument but he sucks as a teacher, instructor or guide to the instrument. He sits there mumbling and playing like he is trying to keep it a secret. The people who paid him to do this quickly realized he was just there for a quick check; and this was going to be the real piece of crap that it is . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I CAN ONLY WARN YOU ONCE> DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE>"
3,A great start of a musical legacy,"This album takes us back to the eighties. It has great beats and production. I love the slow jams Is This The End & Jealous Girl which still make their way own to my slow james mixes. This album also featured some up-tempo hits in the form of the title track, Popcorn Love and She Gives Me A Bang. This album prepared the world for what would be the true New Edition. None of the toughness or street touches that emerged on their later material was evident on this slick, pop-oriented session. Ralph Tresvant, Ronald DeVoe, Michael Bivins, Ricky Bell, and Bobby Brown were all aged 13 to 15 when this was released and it shows."
3,Good for once,"It has only a few good songs, you get bored very easily from the songs wich sound very similar between them. Poor sound quality."
3,Pretty Good for it's time,"New Edition has had more Succesful Memebers come out of it in the last 20 years.The Saturday Night Live of Groups.this Disc was Catchy at the time.Very J-5 Influenced.Maurice Starr Love Him or Hate Him is responsable for all of the Boy Band Group Resurgences.Candy Girl is I want You Back for the 80's as in MMMp Bop is the 90's.the same thread.Is This The End&Jealous Girl are Good Solid Slow-Jams.but most of this Disc is Very Formulated.but nothing more or Less than you get now.it's a Shame they don't get the Juice they Deserve.I Believe it's only because of The Color of THeir Skin.what has NKTOB,BACkSTREET,N-SYNC,98&Countless others done differently than NEW Edition?? Nothing Period.New Edition are Very Influential.they took The Past&Created their Own.you can't Deny their Impact.this Album was Pretty Good For it's Time."
3,SINISTER,"ANTHONY PERKENS IS A GOOD ACTOR. HE CAN ALMOST PULL OFF ANYTHING, SINISTER. IN THIS MOVIE, I DON'T EVER THINK I SEEN HIM SO DAMMED EVIL. IT IS A TWO FACED DR. JEKELL & MR. HYDE. NO HOLDS BAR AS THEY SAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU SEE THIS MOVIE. I HAVE TO SAY THEY PLAY WITH LOTS OF COLORS."
4,"Good read, unclear at times","Great concept for this book, lots of cool hereos are introduced, an d a lot of information is given about the future of the JLA. The book lacks completeness though, at some points when it shifts scenes it will leave you saying what's going on? The description page given beforehand doesn't subsitute for actualy seeing the action. All in all it's a good read, a bit confusing at points, but a good read."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"When have one million years passed by our calendar? That would be the 853rd century. Got that? Ok.Pretty obviously a time travel story, the current era Justice League of America are invited to the future for a celebration of the good work that they began in their time.All is not as it seems, and with a pair of Batman around, and something is suspicious, things could get ugly, quickly."
3,Thought it was a movie...,But it's just a collection of episodes from Season 1. It's my Fault for not reading the fine print. The show is very cute though. My 16 month old and my 8 year old both enjoy watching the show. Great for car rides!
4,Men with Udders,"My twin 10-year-old boys love Barnyard, so if it makes them happy, I'm happy. Their favorite character is Snotty-boy, but this series needs to release more TV-episode DVDs, as this character is not particularly featured here. My big problem is male cows with disturbing, fleshy udders."
4,my review,"I am not totally impress with the performance of this microphone. Even when I adjust the gain to the lower dB, it still have some distortion at high frequency input (like the singer with high pitch voice). Other than that, it's good to have wireless and no antena to worry about. It's a compact unit. It would be nice to have an on/off switch rather have to unhook the power cable every time to turn it off."
2,Not a quality DVD,"This video seemed like a bunch of clips just thrown together with no real direction. It had a few interesting clips in it, but not enough to make this an acceptable movie.The price of the DVD surpassed the quality of the content."
4,"Mostly inspiring, a little cheesy.","I've turned to this book again and again for Jewish holiday celebrations, and it often has lovely ideas. Just as often, some of them strike me as rather improbable and silly. On the plus side, the sukkahs she describes making are lovely interpretations of the idea, but on the minus side, trying to follow her directions to actually construct one will make you crazy. BELIEVE ME. I've used some of her ideas for Rosh Hashanah cards and been pleased with the results, but the Purim costumes and mishloach manot baskets mostly seem silly. And make your own journal for Yom Kippur? I don't know, I'm always way too busy to mess with something like that. Many of her recipes are surprisingly delicious, especially her orange-chocolate hamantaschen and the raspberry linzer-torte hamantaschen...YUM! So while it's not always consistent, I am glad to have it in my library nonetheless."
3,Started off wonderful but couldn't finish it off,"This is not how I like to finish one of Stephen King's books. When I first started it I was amazed on how great he had everything set up in a way where it would be impossible to blow the ending. The best thing about this book was the way he wrote the characters. They seemed to jump off the pages and come to life in your own little world. All in all, this is probably the best character-describing he's done to date, save MAYBE It. But to read something 700 pages long and getting a bad ending almost makes you want to never buy a long book again. But then again every author, even the best of them, can't write awesome endings after endings. But let me tell you this is no It, The Shining, or The Stand."
2,Fun to read...,"...but the ending left me hanging. If you have a sick sense of humor, you might actually find antics of Mr. Gaunt quite amusing. I just didn't feel the ending did the book any justice."
1,This book is not worth your money.,"I got this book from a friend who really loved King and he thought that i might like this book too. Well, that was a big mistake! I have never read a book which was so boring as this one, it couldn't keep my attention and I forced myself to read it till the end as so many people think King is brilliant and I wanted to know why. I still don't know why after reading this book and I don't think I will ever know why because this was the last book of King I will ever touch."
3,Middle of the road,"I read this awhile ago and found it a rehash of Salem's Lot only instead of dracula coming to town, it's the Devil. Some of the characters were interesting but it really didn't have a strong plot so didn't hold my interest."
2,"Not much of a sheriff, either.","This one was just a little too weak for me, although the premise was interesting enough. Most of the characters were never developed to the extent that I was able to care about what happened to them. I also found it hard to believe that any town would be able to hold as many homicidal people as Castle Rock, and I found Ace Merrill's car to be more interesting than most of them. The ending was pure ""Deus ex machina"",with King creating a supernatural band aid to close up all the plot threads. Not one of King's best."
3,300 words too many,"A very interesting idea, but this is an example of how for sometime King seemed to have fallen in love with the sound of hearing himself type. Yet another example (much like insomnia) where king seems to ramble on much too long. The storytelling not nearly as tight as recent works. Not a bad story (though yet another horrible movie conversion) but hardly Kings best. If you have a very loooong flight to take and there is nothing else available you might give it a try."
3,Stop the Overrating!,"People give out 10's on this thing way too easily. I think we should all be a little more objective. Needful Things was a decent enough book -- a great premise that gets bogged down in the middle and kind of crashes into chaos at the end. Not one of Steven King's best. But listen, people are giving 10's and then citing flaws in the book. Could we all reserve 10's for our top 3 favorite books of all time. How about a nice, refreshing 9 every once and a while?"
3,Needful Things needs to be shorter,"NEEDFUL THINGS has a great premise, and a good storyline. That's about it. There are far too many characters that sound exactly the same and the plot moves at a snail's pace. The characters that are good are well developed and human, but at close to 800 pages, it's too long, and its not until halfway through that the results of sinister Leland Gaunt's machinations start to show themselves. After that, when the people of Castle Rock are pitted against each other, the book gets good. But most readers will have lost interest by then. Persevere, though. Definitely one of Stephen King's weakest and darkest novels."
3,An interesting book but it leaves something to be desired.,This was probably the most goriest book I have ever read ( I read horror books quite frequently). The book was hard to put down but the end was kind of silly. I didn't think it was very realistic and sort of like reading a gross fairy tale.
4,glue bottle,not clog proof but clog resistant with a little care. VERY GOOD CONTROL WHEN APPLYING GLUE.
2,Very Bland,"This product is not any better than the bottle that the wood glue comes in in the first place. It has the same slotted cap so what's special about that? It does keep glue fresh, so does the original bottle if you close the cap. It clogs up big time if you don't maintain it a bit, so does the original bottle. It's not just the nozzel that you have to maintain. That delivery canal on the side feeds from the bottom. Wood glue is thick. I threw mine away after it got to where I needed a grip like the Incredible Hulk to get the glue out."
4,buy one size larger,"i tried this fit before and since my feet are wider than most, i had to buy one size larger for it to fit. other than that it's an awesome shoe. no problems. looks good and different from other white adidas superstars or italias that most people wear."
2,Pop filter,I would not recommend this filter. It doesn't attach to the stand securily and the gooseneck is too flexible.Very hard to get it to stay in the position that you want it in.
2,So-so,I found the product to be too 'non-resilient' for the rigors of studio use. Plastic ring broke upon installation.
2,Awful,A timeswept type of story about a woman(Charli) from 1993 who's send back in time 1889. This story is not an orignal if your looking something fresh. I like the Charli enough her action are all justified. But i felt that the hero(Trey) is imature and need more character build up. At the very end it felt like there is a second book but no sequels for this. And i was really disappointed because i never knew if and how they will cope with each other in the time where they end up.Waste of money
4,cool Set,"Mikki Howard has always been to me one of the most Underrated Vocalists out here.Her voice never falls to any challenge She is always on time with me.got to hear this set a few years back after She did a Tribute TO Lady Day Billie Holiday&I wondered why on earth Her Record Company stopped pushing Her Career??it's a Mystery to me because what is out now She can easily do.this is a cool set&She turns out Aretha Franklin's ""Until you come back to me,(that's what I'm gonna do.solid Performance."
3,"Great mix, dope jams and high powered funk",DJ Skribble provides the cleanest mixes available on the market today. He is the bomb.
1,Do not waste your money! Season 3 is replay of 1 and 2,Season 3 is just about the same of seasons 1 and 2...Do not expect to see new episodes...You will find only a compilation of the same episodes shown on seasons 1 and 2...Very disappointing!!! I want my money back!
1,Pornography Without the Sex,"""The Hills"" is too inert to function as a guilty pleasure. Almost literally nothing happens. Perfectly turned out and indistinguishable-except-for-hair-color twentysomething girls wander from one generic L.A. location to another having meandering conversations. Their nominal spats over boys and personal slights are all glancing and muffled, never registering as actual conflict. The unscripted but clearly manufactured dialog is disorientingly stiff, like outtakes from a crime scene reenactment or a TV movie where all the beats are off. There are times when the vacuousness rises to a level of eerie perfection, but these are passing moments interspersed amid long stretches of tedium. Because scene after scene of involves women in tight dresses milling around brightly lit rooms for no discernible reason, ""The Hills"" resembles nothing so much as a pornographic movie. Except someone has gone through this porno and cut out all the sex scenes."
1,Much better books available.,"I wish I had not bought this. Instead I suggest the DVD ""Go Paddle"" and the books ""The Kayak Companion"" and ""Kayaking Made Easy""."
2,Cure for the insomniacs,"This book was assigned to me for summer reading for Advance Placement Government class. I got it through borders and paid high price for it, I highly suggest buying it used through amazon.com. In the beginning this novel seemed very interesting with its unique insider perspective however this insider perspective drowned the novel with annoying anecdotes. The perspective was lost with countless examples that were perfect cure for when I was in desperate need of sleep. The author states his views and makes his points in the first page of two of every chapter and for the next 10-20 pages it just filled with every moment of his 30+ year experience at D.C. This novel is 700+ pages long and could very easily be trimmed down to under a 100 and still have a greater impact. So I would advise to buy it used then just read the first page of every section."
1,not recomended,"I was disappointed with this DVD because it is an amateur recording, no good sound, no good images. I don't recommend."
2,Faint Scent,"I can barely smell the rose scent- it's very diluted. The smell also changes to something very unpleasant on the skin, hair or anything else that's being sprayed on after a while. Won't purchase again."
5,Very good book!,"The book 'A Handbook of Weaves: 1875 illustrations' is a very old publication but very interesting, precious! It is similar publications about weaves books ancient incas. I recommend it.Eliane Vieira"
2,Poor fit,"This product has a great appearance in the stock photo, but did NOT look like that on my son's carseat. It fit very akwardly and would be a pain to reposition each time I put him in it... therefore, I am sending it back! I don't know if the thickness of the regular Bundle Me would keep it in place a bit better, but this one just didn't work out for me at all..."
3,"Day 2, still cant connect to network.","This card is well constructed and installed effortlessly. Unfortunately, the ""installation"" disc it came with only includes an older version of Acrobat 4.0 and a Quick Start Guide/User Manual. There is no software or wizard to help you with setup.The manual prompts you to type in an IP address to your browser address bar. OK, so I did that...now what??? The options I'm told I'd be presented with are not there, and I tried IE and Firefox on a clean install of XP Pro. I'm anxious to see what this lan card can do cause the old 802b adapter I had in the computer only gets a ""good/very low"" signal on my network, where this Gigabyte board shows an ""excellent"" signal, but I still can't connect. I'll keep after it, but I'm an experienced hardware guy and installation should not be this difficult."
5,Beet Root,I only used this for a bit and completely forget to take it. That is not the companies fault. I received it quickly and I read that it is good for you but as I said I forget to take it. I definitely recommend this product if want it fast.
4,beet root,Product shipped rightly and timely As always I appreciate this product Its like a daily dose of vegatables Love it
4,Satchmo performing with VERVE,"The sixteen tracks on THE ESSENTIAL LOUIS ARMSTRONG were drawn from the VERVE records archives. These recordings extend to 1966, with the earliest (and majority) from 1957 sessions. Emphasis here is on vocalizations, including two duets with Ella Fitzgerald. These jazz standards are all in stereo, and are uniformly excellent examples of later-career Satchmo. A highly enjoyable album.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 61:39"
5,"Verve/PolyGram ""Essential"" a must have","This is a great compilation that will never, never grow old on you! Verve/Polygram's ""Essential"" series is a great one and this CD is a good example.You will find yourself singing to the CD, singing after the CD is over and sharing this with your friends and family. This is an ""essential"" CD to have in your collection, as well as to round out what you have in your collection presently with Louis Armstrong's name on it!"
5,Brotherhood,"My hat is off to the Choppertown people. This documentary is incredible. I watch it probably twice a month without hesitation and even more when its raining and I cant go ride. The video follows around the The Sinners MC, who are the epitome of biker cool. You get to watch them interact, ride, and build some of the coolest hand made motorcycles you've ever seen. You also get to see the enigmatic Jason Jessee and all his lunatic splendor as he rides and works with his Sinners brothers. Which is always a plus. In short this video really captures the essence and the very definition of ""biker brotherhood"". If you are thinking about buying this dvd, dont think...pull the trigger. You wont regret it.Also, for those of you who dont get it.....you never will."
4,"fun, imaginative read","Starts out a bit hum-drum but by the time the unlucky protaganist's long-lost demigod brother shows up I was hooked.Amusing and readable, with strong undertones of wonder and mystery. Sold me on Gaiman."
4,Much more concise and straight forward,"Although American Gods was a great book and had more of the novelty feeling, I would have to say I enjoyed Anansi Boys more. This is because the plot is more concise and straight forward, taking on a smaller cast of characters and allowing them to interact with each other more closely.His writing style is the same as American Gods and flows easily. My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that the plot towards the end came together a bit too neat, but by that point what do you care? You are already sucked in and will continue reading. Beyond that the same allure of god figures roaming our world with us is present and captures your interest immediately. I would definitely recommend.4 stars."
2,Poor for Gaiman,"American Gods was a fun take on gods. With that in mind, I looked forward to Anansi Boys. Oooops. The book was about as predictable as could be. Nothing original existed in the book and it often seemed its purpose was to piece together a few shticks that came to the mind of the author. True, some of the shticks and jokes were cute, but that doesn't make a novel. I was fairly certain how it would end from very early on, and the righting wasn't exciting enough to let me get past that.If you want a really funny, well written book about ancient gods and modern people wandering around together, getCoyote Blue: A Novel. It's great!"
2,A long story that never really starts,"Being a fan of Gaiman, and having read all his novels, I am sorry to say that this is (in my opinion) his worst work. It's definitely too long, the story, althogh filled with characters and situations, never starts, and all the situations are predictable.My suggestion, if you're interested anyway, is at least to wait for the paperback edition"
3,What it is,"Not everyone's cup of tea, but a talented twist on old tales. You get completely different stuff from this author."
4,Good book.,"This book was a bit of a let down to me as originaly I had heard it was to be a sequel to American Gods, however it is not.The book is good though, once I got past my dissapointment. Gaiman is a great author and I love both this and American Gods as they have gods living on earth along side us. The characters are interesting in both books and I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone.-Ryan Mercer."
4,Sibling Rivalry With a Wacky Vengance,"What if you found out that not only your father, but also the brother you never knew you had were actually ludicrously powerful and endlessly mischevious Gods (that's right, Gods), and your only superpower seemed to be the ability to suffer endlessly from their pranks and hijinks?To say much more would spoil this lighthearted (yet pitch black) comedic sequel to ""American Gods"" (though you don't need to have read the first one to enjoy ""Anasasi""). Plenty of laugh out loud moments -- much fun and a quick read that I conistently found tough to put down.All in all, it's kind of a supernatural ""Confederacy of Dunces"" with a bit of Douglas Adams & just a pinch of Python.""Anasasi Boys"" would make a great movie, but only if directed by Terry Gilliam."
5,As Magical as it is True,"<em>Anansi's Boys</em> are Fat Charlie Nancy and Spider. Fat Charlie is an entry-level accountant in England engaged to a nice girl with a mean mother whose highest aspiration is to shake off the Fat from his name. Spider is a free spirit whose every move he makes with the sole purpose of pleasing himself.The brothers' lives intersect after Anansi, who is a trickster God, dies in Florida and Fat Charlie goes home for his funeral. There, the old ladies who shaped his early life break him in on the truths that will undo Fat Charlie's world and allow him to remake it.Anansi's boys will travel in and out of the underworld as they put together the pieces of their father's story in order to make sense of their own and therefore survive.Gaiman's book blends the mundane with the magical to create a book that is as witty as it is out of this world as it is true to the life of the heart and mind.a>"
4,Very Charming Comedic Novel by Gaiman,"Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite fantasy writers, and ANANSI BOYS didn't disappoint me. This is a very entertaining novel.ANANSI BOYS is a very funny and original story about a man named Fat Charlie, who suddenly learns that he is the son of the trickster God Anansi. Fat Charlie also discovers that he has a long lost brother name Spider, who has decided to re-enter his life and turn it upside down.Gaiman has a lovely writing style that incorporates a lot of gentle, whimsical humor. It's hard to describe, but it makes his novels a pleasure to read. This is a comic novel, so many of the characters border on caricature, but Gaiman does a good job of making them human and believable for the most part.I wouldn't say ANANSI BOYS is a great Gaiman novel -- I think NEVERWHERE, STARDUST, AND CORALINE are better works -- but it's a very good one and I had a lot fun reading it. Highly recommended for fans of comedic fantasy."
4,A good read,"The might be the most tightly plotted of all Gaiman's work. It was a pleasure to read, with the right blend of humor and gothic horror. He also did a fine job of making each character strong and unique.Gaiman's best work is always so flawed; he can create a dream world but has trouble controlling it. He can be sloppy. Anansi Boys is less dream-like, and more grounded in reality (or rather, Gaiman's magic alternate reality) than Sandman and Neverwhere - and it's a stronger work for it."
1,Worse than the Greek Way.,"A while ago, I wrote an online review of the Greek Way (same author). I criticized it for being unclear. I thought that no book could ever be more boring than that one. Once again, I was wrong. Edith Hamiliton once again forgot to include things that are relatively important or interesting. Parts of the book include sections on Roman drama, history, and Philosophy."
4,Symphonic 9 in. TV,I purchase the set on 6-15- 2007 and received it on 6-27-2007. Put the set together and program the channels. All the channels are clear but channel 4. We don't have satellite or cable. Channel 4 is the same withother sets in the house. I purchase a set at mall in May and had to returned it as it only picked up one channel and wasn't clear as theSymphonic set. I only wished that it was a 13 - 15 inch screen.
3,Not too much to say,"More about 'relaxation' than giving the experience of being there. Eg it's 720x480 (maybe that's all that DVD can manage) but eg, one segment 'Wavy Dreams' is /badly/ compressed or something, it has terrible circular artefacts); image quality is too low for it to be /meant/ to be stared at. Alas. Too, I wish they'd leave it on some scenes longer, maybe with slow tracking or rotating to deal with the boredom. Overall I love the concept, and the music is pretty good. But, personally I want the experience of being at the shore, not just a 'relaxation package' that you're not supposed to pay close attention to."
2,Not as described!,"Beware - the description says this DVD is in English and French. It is not - it is only in French. I bought is precisely because it was supposed to be in French also, I'm very disappointed."
1,dont have book,"okay so i dont have this book. but before i get it i need to know if it has diagrams, or is just words? so someone leave more comments for me on how it looks and works. (p.s. i gave it a one because i dont know about it)"
2,Not correct product,"The model number was correct, but It was basically 2 used rechargeable batteries taped together with electrical tape. There were no alignment tabs (could be reversed in the camera), and the batteries didn't fit into the camera because of the tape. I called and was quickly given a refund."
2,Lacking features,"I don't like this HRM because it only allows one piece of data to be displayed at a time. It is very awkward to do intervals using both the heart rate and the time (timer is also limited to a count up timer), having to switch back and forth. I had been using a rather inexpensive Timex HRM and it is much better than this product at a comparable price."
1,Loosey Goosey,"For me, the fit is poor - I am short, wear a 38C bra. No 'shaping', just another layer. Went back to my Naomi & Nicole which has nice compression and stays put."
5,The Best!,"You simply can't make real Ma Po Tofu without this sauce. It's absolutely fantastic, the #1 best. Twenty years ago, I would scour Chinatown and Japantown for this stuff, and buy every jar I could find. Now it's much easier to locate, but I still tend to stock up because it's just that precious."
2,3 unrelated albums packaged together,"This is not a collection and it's far from essential. This is 3 old Goodman CDs packaged together and called Essential. Each CD is only about 40 minutes long, and there's some very annoying narration on CD 1.There are much better collections out there. Skip this one."
2,Not recommended,"I was anxious to try many of the recipes in this book as the descriptions made them seem almost too good to believe. Well, as they say, if it seems to good to be true than it probably is. The first thing one will need to do if they plan to try the recipes in this book is find a good source for Carb solutions shake mix as it is the favored flour substitute in most recipes. I found the claim that mixing Carb solutions vanilla shake mix with butter, vanilla, splenda and an egg would produce sugar cookies that tasted just like the real stuff hard to believe. Alas, I was right. They have a taste and texture nothing like real sugar cookies and I would hesitate to try any of the other cookie recipes using essentially the same ingredients. I was disappointed in this cookbook and would not recommend it."
3,Paradigm shifting,"I loved the essential message of this book (""Every breakthrough in science is achieved through a paradigm shifting experience that initially is resisted"")and I think it is a book worth reading for anyone seeking to keep their mind constantly open to sudden changes of perspectives -which the author calls paradigm shifts- whether of Galilean measure or simply related to their personal circumstances. However Kuhn's academic, dense, writing style does not help make this book particularly accessible or pleasant for lovers of knowledge without a scientific background.Stefania LucchettiAuthor of ""The Principle of Relevance""The Principle of Relevance"
5,Enlightning!,Kuhn does a fantastic job outlining the chaotic backward and forward leaps involved in the advancement of the religion we call Science. Truely enlightning!
2,Not enough product,This is not not enough and is way to expensive .There is no difference than with Ritz dye..I wish I never paid so much for a product that fades..It didn't even work..
2,When pickings are slim...,"I would still caution others away from this book. Tregillis' book reads as would an extra long 10th grade report. There is little life to the book, and finishing the book would a chore for even a saint. The best part would most definately be the collection of maps and drawings that Tregillis gathered, although there is little commentary on them, and seem randomly scattered through the text. It is hard to find books about the Native Americans in Ohio, and harder still to find a good one. Unless you are a glutton for punishment - pass this one by."
1,Ultraviolet refuses to work on my Ipod Touch,"We bought a copy of the blueray disc with ultraviolet copy from a local retail establishment. Not knowing what ultraviolet movies were, and expecting to get a real digital copy like always, we only discovered our error after getting the movie home. So, we went through all the rigmarole of creating our Flixter account and downloading the app to both our computer and our Ipod Touch. After we had done all that and entered the code for the movie, we discovered that for whatever reason, we were unable to download the digital movie to our device. Attempting to stream the movie to the device (which is not what we had really wanted) gave a similar error message. So far, we have been unable to resolve the issue. If you are looking for a real digital copy, this is NOT what you want to buy."
1,Digital Copy is worthless for Apple TV - What a waste,Movie is good but the Digital copy is absolutely terrible - What is Flixster / Ultraviolet - Big waste of time!!!!!
3,I dunno..really,"It's so lala, I really can't say it's good or bad. If you are a fan of the series, get it, you will want to watch it, but the WOW effect of the first movies is gone. This one is better than the ""first part"" or this two parter, which should have been named ""Harry Potter And The Shameless Moneymaker"" but it's still nothing to make you jump out of the chair"
1,Digital copy bait and switch,"Like others I am really dissatisfied that this disc shipped with the Ultraviolet ""digital copy"". When I pre-ordered, this wasn't specified, so I assumed it would be an iTunes download (like HP7 part 1). I don't have any interest in multiplying the number of incompatible video files, copy protections, and media players on my system, so the ""digital copy"" isn't any use to me."
5,The Deathly Hallows 2 is great!,I ordered the Deathly Hallows2 about a week before it came out and I received it the day it would have come out in the stores! I love Amazon's ability to get their products out to customers so fast. The movie was in perfect condition and I have to force myself not to watch it every month.
5,A Triumph,"First off, the UV watch was fast, beautiful, seamless, pleasant from start to finish. The MOVIE was superb. I applaud J.K.Rowling for her complete Harry Potter masterpiece and to all involved in the making of the film. Having read the book(s) many times over, I appreciate the aspects true to the printed story and those aspects unique to the film, which were appropriate to the storyline so that it was like getting a glimpse at a believable, alternate, just as enjoyable Harry Potter world."
1,Avoid Ultraviolet Digital Copies!,"The movie, like all the Harry Potter movies, is EXCELLENT! Don't take this as anything against the movies.The problem is the studio switching to Ultraviolet for the digital copy. To be blunt, it is NOT A DIGITAL COPY!It is, instead, a subscription to a Warner Brothers online service.Suggest you avoid this version of the movie and buy versions which are BluRay or DVD only!"
1,"Good movie, but has Ultraviolet.","I got this from Amazon the day it came out. So I sit down, open the package, and decide to redeem the digital copy. It's Ultraviolet. I don't need to get into it, look at the other reviews here. The plan was to watch the movie on the plane on my iPad.Warner Bros fails at that. One star for poor execution.Instead I got the movie from Amazon.ca. No Ultraviolet up north yet. Downloaded the digital copy and it worked like a charm. Didn't get it in time for the plane ride but I DID get the iTunes digital copy.Stay away from Ultaviolet."
1,UV/Flixter is total RUBBISH,"Movie is OK (personally I think it suffers by comparison to the Pre-Deathly Hallows offerings). But Flixter UltraViolet is a TOTAL DISASTER. I created a Flixter account without a problem, but UV is a nightmare. After a LOT of digging around in the FLixter site I created one, maybe two UV accounts (only certain characters allowed in passwords - but you're not informed of this up front). BUT ...I can't login to EITHER account. I am unable to retrieve the UV copy of this movie that I HAVE PAID FOR. This is a TOTAL RIP OFF.This is what happens when companies (WB and its Flixter franchise) care MORE about $$$$ than they do about CLIENTS."
1,Ultraviolet is Ultrahorrible - AVOID this combo!,"Do not waste your money on this, specifically because the ""digital copy"" is not a digital copy at all. It's a wretched attempt at forcing consumers to use a terribly kludgy streaming service. You have to sign up for multiple different accounts on different no-name websites just to access the video. Once these different sites all have your personal info and email address, then you are presented with several options to stream or ""download"" the video. I quote ""download"" because in order to get the movie onto your computer, you have to install a bunch of applications in order to watch the video, and once the video file is downloaded it's less than half the file size of what you would get from iTunes - translation: it's less than half the image quality. Save your money, skip this version, buy the DVD instead, and create your own digital copy from your purchased disc using any of the many LEGAL applications that rip DVDs to video files on your computer."
1,Movie Great - Digital copy sucks,The movie was great and a great way to finish the series but the digital copy through Flixster is a complete rip-off. No one sould buy any Flixster digital copies because it's NOT worth it. Save your money.
1,"no digital copy, no buy","I refuse to buy this product without an itunes digital copy. Stop pushing the ultraviolet cr@p on us. Movie was great, but don't hobble it by tacking on a useless digital copy."
1,DO NOT BUY,"HP Deathly Hallows 2, great way to finish the series........however I will not be buying this combo package that offers no hard digital copy! Will wait until the rush is over and pick up the blu-ray afterwards. UltraViolet Digital Copy is a sham!!!"
1,Movies great but beware Ultraviolet digital.,"I bought Part 1 of this movie a year ago with digital copy so I could add it to my digital library for the kids iPods and iPads and stream it over my home network. I didn't think twice about buying Part 2 with digital copy. Now I wish I'd paid more attention. Ultraviolet doesn't let you 'own' a copy of the movie, rather you're allowed to stream it, if your devices support that. After I've already put in apple TV's throughout my house that's not an option. What a waste of money. I guess I won't be buying anymore 3d blu rays with digital copy. From here on out I'll just make my buys straight from the ITunes store and not worry about the 3d/Blu-ray/DVD copies. We only needed the DVD copy for the kids to watch on the go, and only bought 3D thinking we might upgrade the players at some point, but that's not going to happen now. Oh well, life goes on I guess."
1,Digital Copy is not what expected. Ultraviolet does not work,Ultraviolet has not permitted me to download the digital copy since receiving the Blu-Ray disk. I am very unhappy with this. I will not buy another of these digital copies.
1,UltraViolet Stinks!,The movie itself is great but I am mad that the digital copy requires this UltraViolet crap. I bought this thinking that I would get an actual digital copy that I could use on iTunes and instead I got this junk.UPDATE -I emailed Flixster and requested and iTunes code for the Harry Potter movie and they very quickly gave me one. From email to code was no more than 15 minutes.
1,DO NOT BUY FOR DIGITAL COPY! ITS A TRAP!,"This ""ultraviolet digital copy"" does not let the consumer download a copy to their preferred entertainment software organizer (ie iTunes). They want you to sign up for their stupid service and use their worthless app on your device.Just when I thought Warner Brothers couldn't sink any lower from only providing digital copies of their movies with expiration dates they go and do this. Boo! I will be avoiding any Bluray disk of Warner Brothers in the future."
3,Faulty Description at time of purchase,"I purchased this item under the impression from the description that it included a dvd and blu ray copy. The image was the same as it currently is that says blu ray, but I double checked the description 3, yes 3 times, to make sure that it included a dvd copy. I knew it said movie only, so therefore would not include special features, or voice commentary, but I specifically bought this item because of the description that it included a dvd copy as well as the blu ray. So I was extremely disappointed when it arrived and in was the blu ray only version. I considered sending it back, but decided it's really not worth the trouble. I will likely take it to one of the local brick and mortar stores and see if I can exchange it. They have since changed the description of this item since I ordered, likely due to complaints and it now states that it is exclusively a blu ray copy. Wish I knew that then, I would NOT have bought it."
5,Great Movie. Great price,It was everything the ad promised and it arrived quickly. I thought I was just going to have to give it to my brother as a random gift since I ordered it so close to christmas but it got here on time to wrap it up and put it under the tree.
5,great movie,we love all the harry potter movies and books..this is a great movie and has a wonderful ending to sum up the adventures
5,BEST POTTER MOVIE,This is the best Harry Potter Movie of the series and explains everything and when you go back to watch the others now everything makes sense!!
5,Deathly Hallows Part 2 Blue-ray/DVD combo,"This product arrived in the promised condition well in time for the Christmas holidays. Because we are big fans of the entire series (read the books together as a family and saw each movie as soon as it came out), we have not yet used the product, but because of the condition of other items we have purchased on Amazon we are confident in giving this one five stars (and the movie itself was certainly at least five stars!)."
2,Blue Ray defective,Am I the only one seeing the frame jumps on the blue ray disk I returned the first copy thinking I had a dud the second copy has the frame jumps in the same places this along with the bogus digital copy crap is enough the entire package is junk I'm returning for a refund.PS the glitches happened at the exact same places on two different disk being played on two different machines so not a problem with my equipment but disk manufacturing.
1,What the HELL! I just spent my hard earned money...,"I adore Harry Potter. In fact I am fanatical about the Franchise. I own the audiobooks of the series, the books and every single one of the DVD's including the deluxe versions. So when I recieved my bluray 3 disc set I was so excited. However, the excitement turned to disappointment when I went to load the ""special features"" disc and my bluray player displayed the words ""unknown disc."" The bluray disc does that was a part of this 3 disc set did not play in my bluray player. I then purchased the same set from two other stores and unfortunately they did not play the ""special features"" disc either. Has anyone else had this problem? Unfortunately I am going to have to send this back to Amazon for a refund. I'm so disappointed."
1,Warner Brothers hates its customers,"They treat all customers like pirates, they impose this Flixster nonsense on us, and deny users the ability to carry the movie around with them on their chosen devices.The question is why? And we'll never know. I won't care because I'll pick this one up used in a few months. I'll also rip it from the disc and do what I want with it. It's not right, and nothing will make it right.This movie is available for digital download, so go get it from the various services if you want. I for one will avoid any Ultraviolet equipped movies, and I hope Amazon will mark them as such.As far as the movie goes, get it somehow. Watch part 1 and 2 together straight. It's a drearily beautiful movie. Even the epilogue, which should be triumphant, has a twinge of deep sadness to it."
5,Entertaining!!!!,What can you say about Harry and his friends that haven't been said!!!! Enjoyed the whole series of films and are sad to see them done. At least Voldemort was taken care of!!!!
4,The Dark before the Dawn,"This is probably the ""darkest"" of the series. The fun and humor of the earlier films is overshadowed by the seriousness of Harry's situation. Ron and Hermione are fully matured now, although Ron still suffers from his insecurity over Hermione's relationship with Harry. Although these films are loved by the preteens, this one might be better suited to the over 15 group."
1,Harry Potter and the deathly Hollows,"If you are going to purchase this product, it does not come with the digital version,only in USA and in most cases when you buy from a store you get the two c/d's here you only get the one.This was a cheap disc with poor packing and packaging. The case was the cheapest thing you could buy from China and the covers are not to a good standard.Basically cheep ,cheap , stay away."
4,A fitting end,This movie is a fitting end to this series. We had never watched any of the Harry Potter movies until we ran out of something to watch. Once we started this series we found that the movies were very good. The last movie was great and the movie didn't leave us hanging like some movies do. Great series.
5,What a way to end the series.,"There is nothing I can say about Harry Potter other than I don't think ther will ever be anyone who can beat these books and movies. They stayed so true to the books, it was a pleasure to watch over and over again. If you haven't read or watched this series, please do yourself a big favor and watch the movies. It's fun to see all the kids grow up right before your eyes."
3,UK version includes 3D Blu-ray and real Digital Copy,"I'm not buying the U.S. version, the region free UK release will include the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD and a real Digital Copy. No UltraViolet Digital Copy."
1,Incredible movie BUT ULTRAVIOLET COPY SUCKS!!!,"My family and I just watched this movie and it was INCREDIBLE!!! I'm very happy I watched it.Unfortunately, the Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" doesn't download to iTunes. I can't believe in this day and age a movie studio put out a digital copy that doesn't download to iTunes. What a waste!"
1,wanted plain dvd,"What happened to getting just a plain, regular, good old fashioned DVD? What's with the ultrviolet, digital, etc. etc?There are people out here who do not want Blue Ray, Ultraviolet, etc. etc.It would seem the whole idea now is not to supply a good DVD but to try and shove off all the newest ""garbage"", electronicjunk, etc., which of course costs more for the consumer and will probably be outdated in a year or so. Then you will haveto buy more of the newest ""garbage""."
1,"Don't buy with Digital Copy in US , UV copy is garbage","Ultraviolet is the worst Digital Copy medium I could have ever imagined. The old way was atleast useful.Basically this product requires any device (ANY) to require an internet connection to use said digital copy. For those who dont understand , no internet, no movie. It is garbage and I would recommend just buying the straight Blu-Ray and purchasing 3rd party software and rip your own High def copy."
1,no interview?,"I find it outrageous that you cannot buy the DVD version with the Rowling interview. That the interview can only be seen on the Blu-Ray version. I refuse to purchase a Blu-ray player so I will simply not buy this movie at all. Thanks a lot, Warner Bros."
1,Ultraviolet is ultra greedy!,"I just cancelled my pre-order because of this. I thought we had antitrust laws in the USA. If this isn't collusion and anti-competitive behavior I don't know what is. The whole point is by not allowing you to play their content on Apple products they are preventing Apple from competing. Plus, saying there is a ""digital copy"" when there isn't is false advertising. Sickening!"
1,Ultraviolet Digital Copy=EPIC FAILURE!!!!!!!,"FIRST OFF I LOVE THE MOVIE! 10 OUT OF 5 STARS FOR THE MOVIE! I have never given a 1-star rating before! I pre-ordered this title a long time ago and I still have the e-mail receipt. It says nothing about an ""Ultraviolet"" Digital Copy... but now it does on the Amazon sight if I click the link from my past orders. I purchased this set because I've loved having previous Harry Potter digital copies on my laptop, iPhone, iPad, etc. Had I known the UV digital copy was such a joke I would not have purchased this set! I would have paid less for the DVD/Bluray alone and purchased the REAL digital copy by some other means. I am absolutely disgusted by this worthless UV digital copy junk! Thanks for nothing Warner Brothers!"
2,Ultraviolet downloads,"It doesn't work with iTunes. It is in the new Ultraviolet platform and is not an improvement upon iTunes, nor do I need two different catalog systems for my entertainment. The Ultraviolet format is incompatible with various devices - it is buggy and as mentioned, yet another service to sign up for."
4,Last of the series,"As with all the movie vs book a general license is granted to incorporate as much of the written plot in to the actual film. Still, all in all an enjoyable conclusion to the ""Harry Potter"" series. Dark characterization of ""evil"" even more so than the previous books. Well done finale."
3,Plain DVD players get short shrift,"I have searched for a regular (not Blu-ray) DVD of this that has the interview between Daniel Radcliffe and Jo Rowling, the expanded viewing with explanations of special effects, and the other good stuff that the Blu-ray package has. It is not available to me. This is discrimination, and another way of forcing me to buy a TV and DVD player that I don't want or need, since mine work just fine, and I don't want to replace them right now. I am very disappointed in this trend. It was the same with HP & DH, part 1, and other recent DVDs."
4,Deathly Hallows and Beyond!,"I've thought all along that the first two HP movies were the best. After watching Deathly Hallows my opinion hasn't changed. Hallows looked and felt like a movie trying to find an end, and it finally did. Acting and special effects were excellent, but the Steve Kloves' screenplay left me wanting.It's hard to believe that both JK Rowling and Warner Bros. Pictures would let such a successful franchise die, so I see a bright future for Harry Potter adventures, no doubt with a completely new slate of actors and characters. Perhaps Harry becomes the headmaster at Hogwarts and stumbles onto another Tom Riddle, or we skip a generation and pick up with the adventures of Albus Potter. It's impossible to predict, but I'm sure Harry will be back in one form or another. I'll be a happy camper when that happens."
1,"Movie is great, Ultraviolet is horrible","This movie is great. Our entire family enjoyed the Harry Potter series, including this finale. Thus, we'd give the Bluray and DVD 5 stars.That being said, the Ultraviolet copy is streaming digital and worthless. We have loaded other digital movies onto our boys' iPod Touch and iPad devices and they can take the movies with them wherever they go, including car rides to relatives in others states. You cannot do this with Ultraviolet because it requires a continuous internet connection (via streaming). Save your money and get the Bluray and/or DVD without the Ultraviolet. If this is the future of digital media, it stinks. We will never buy another movie with prepackaged Ultraviolet again. Warner Brothers, I hope you're listening. We thought we were getting a regular digital copy as we had never heard of Ultraviolet before. I never want to hear of it again."
4,Wonderful ending to a great series,Wonderful ending to a great series. I'll miss all the characters from Hogwarts but have all the movies in the series to go back to.
3,fine,This movie has a few skips in it. I dont know why you would sell a movie that isn't playing right.
2,Done purchasing Digttal Copy,"Foe the past two years, I have often purchased the digital copy of movies, but no more. I do not like the move to make me use a separate tool to watch the asset. Until this is changed back, I will no longer purchase digital copies of movies."
2,Warner Bros really dropped the ball again!,This is probably the 4th Harry Potter DVD I've bought that appears to have been manufactured poorly. The recurring issue is that the picture looks under-exposed most of the time. I'm glad I saw the films in the theater first so I can mentally fill in the missing visual details.
1,UV Digital Copy 'process' is horrible,"Unfortunately, the Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" doesn't download to iTunes. Warner Brothers drops the ball 'AGAIN' with respect to its Digital Copy policy.How can a movie studio put out a digital copy that doesn't download to iTunes? What a joke... alas a very unfunny joke, on me.The movie itself is fabulous, but the Digital Copy process is scandalous. Shame on you WB.** Submit a support ticket with UV and you can request what SHOULD have come with the digital copy to begin with, the iTunes download code."
1,RIP OFF!,I bought PART 2 today on release day. COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!!!!! it is the same movie as part 1 only 16 minutes removed front the first of part 1 and nothing new. Part 2 means part 2 not a copy of part 1. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED YOU STOLE MY MONEY NOW I HAVE 2 COPIES OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ! How can you legally do that? Why would anyone be stupid enough to buy the same movie twice? You lied when you put part 2 on it. Real rip off do not buy if you have part 1 then you already have part 2 BEWARE potential customers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THE MOVIE COMPANY!
1,Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 - UMD Region Free,"I purchased this UMD cd in error, I don't have any way of playing this type of cd. I paid about $18 and returned it within the week and received $4 credit. That's ridiculus! There was a restocking charge for half the price. This turned out to be an expensive error on my part. I am not happy with the way this vendor does business."
3,Hoped for a better ending ....,"I have loved the Harry Potter series. However, the quality of the previous segments of the story far outweighed the finale. The finale was a let down for me. I was disappointed. The human side of this story with conflict that was not only physical but also psychological would have allowed the viewer to make up their own minds. In other word, a more ambiguous ending would have made more sense. Harry struggle ended too neatly without any loose ends."
1,UltraViolet Digital Copy is CRAP!,"I was very excited to receive my Blu-ray in the mail until I tried to get my digital copy of the movie. Part of the reason I am willing to pay a little extra is so I can have an iTunes-friendly version of the film for use in my car for long trips. For Part 1 I was able to download the iTunes version of the film, so why, for Part 2, did WB go to this UltraViolet crap. What's even worse, I am stationed in Europe so I am not allowed to use the Flixter service at all!!! I will never again purchase another Blu-ray from Amazon so long as the digital copy is UltraViolet. It defeats the entire purpose of ""Watch anywhere from your favorite device""."
4,Potter,"This movie plus the next completed our set of Harry Potter movies. This was as good as expected and worth watching. We have now done a Potter marathon of all the movies, in two days."
4,one more good Potter movie,This was well done and needs no review. If you've seen the rest you'll want this. If you don't like Potter you won't like this.
5,harry potter,This movie was pretty dang close to the book and it had nice special effects. This is a great movie.
1,Ultraviolet is a joke. Don't pay for it.,"I have recently purchased the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 2 and have no problems with the movie. The digital copy is not a digital copy, but a service to load the movie as requested from the internet. The web site to register for the movie has been no operational for over 1 week! I will no longer pay for a digital copy, when in fact it is not a copy and in this case should be illegal as false advertising. Amazon should correct this practice or not sell the product."
4,Movie is great!,"I love the movie, I' am a huge fan of the entire series so a little biased in that sense. The DVD is a bit dark is some scenes, looks a lot better in blue ray. one thing I hated was the UltraViolet Digital copy, I didn't realize it was not a digital copy I could download to my Ipad. You're forced to watch it on your computer or Kindle, and the video is not permanent, it actually expires. Totally lame"
3,Ultraviolet is terrible,The movie is awesome. I bought it at midnight today. Unfortnatly the ultraviolet digital copy is horrible. Buy it on iTunes. And get the regular blu ray or normal dvd.
2,Won't purchase because of UltraViolet Digital Copy,"Love the movie and understand that they may be putting the movies in the vault. Soon all of the films may be unavailable. I will NOT waste my money buying this from Amazon or anywhere else, if only the UltraViolet edition is available. I'm not paying $24-$25 for just the Blu-Ray and DVD. I've known of too many issues with UltraViolet downloads. The last movie purchased, during each attempted download, it stated that they were experiencing technical difficulties from the site (and the download was unavailable). Money down the drain."
4,digital copy,"Good product, the digital copy don't work outside of US and you cant get the pen and notebook gift from the online shop"
3,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2,This film was okay. Not as good as the originaL I think it's time to close the final chapter and move on. Harry is all grown up and reached his potential. How about a new story line from the author. Just wasn't as entertaining as the former episodes. Rather a let down as are most sequals.
1,digital copy,Im very disappointed about the Digital Copies by WB. They have two third party companies Flisxter and Ultraviolet to manage the digital copies you own. You have to sign in for both company and have different password. And I'm using Mac computer it means my digital download does not on itunes its on different folder so it will not sync on my ipod or play on apple TV... This is a waste of money if your into digital copy. And The download of the movie takes forever my took 8hrs... I suggest if your buying a movie and your main reason is the digital copy content of it try to find out if its ultraviolet streaming DONT BUY IT its not worth it...
5,Came Quickly,Even though it was the last of my items to be shipped it was the quickest to get here I love this Movie very Much! I'm Very Happy I bought this product
2,"Great movie, avoid Ultraviolet","Let me start by saying this is a great movie, certainly one worth adding to anyone's collection. This review does not reflect the film, which is easily 5 stars, but rather this version of it. If you are the sort of person who pays a little extra for the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy, you are going to find Ultraviolet to be severely lacking. Warner Bros had a great thing going with the Windows Media/iTunes digital copy; it was something everyone could use because everyone already has one of those two platforms. No one has Flixster as a digital movie repository, let's be realistic. All this does is fragment the idea of a digital movie collection, no longer can you just go to your computer and pick out the movie you want, you have to remember what service it is stored under, what password you use to get to that service, etc."
1,Another ploy from greedy Holly Execs to punish legitimate buyers,"While I absolutely loved this movie, I am utterly disgusted that the so-called ""digital copy"" that is ""included"" with this purchase is actually a subscription to Ultra Violet, a streaming service; instead of a digital copy that resides in my iTunes, to be used on the device of my choice. This is yet another attempt by Hollywood execs to punish legitimate buyers and I will not, under any circumstances purchase a movie that includes an Ultra Violet copy again. I am returning my copy and waiting for the UK version that includes a REAL digital copy."
2,an oldie but a cheapie,"I'm reviewing my needlework books for the purpose of downsizing. This little toss-off will be one of the first to go. No, it's not a bad book per se. But its original cost in 1978 was $1.95 and it hasn't aged that well in 30 years. It's one of the very common household 123 Home Guides, made of extremely cheap, coarse paper: the b&w pics are of poor quality with no color in sight except the front and back covers. (In the Images above, the pink one with the woman holding the purse is the back cover. The sampler of pretty stitches is the front cover.) The projects displayed are too ""groovy"" for today's standards. What the book has to offer is diagrams of several dozen stitches which you might find useful. I can recommend all the books in the bibliography as I own them all."
5,Fade is quite a special character,A gripping tale very well written.Very hard to put down.Lost some sleep because I always had to seethe next chapter.The ending is very satisfyingGuy Dombrowski
3,"Way less provocative than First Love, Last Rites...","Not as good as or as provocative as the other short story volume (First Love, Last Rites), but still worth reading..."
1,Turgid Crap,The only reason I finished this book was because I was on an airplane and had nothing else to read. Turgid self indulgent and really not a pleasure to read.
2,Where's teh theme song,I was horrified when the theme song was missing from this DVD. My 4 year old son has autism and goes through periods of time when he likes to watch and hear the same show or song over and over again. Well now it is Jay Jay. Well he only gets to watch it at the sitter's as we do not get any station that carries it at home. So my husband saw the DVD and bought it. I was so excited.. We showed my son the DVD and he went straigt to the couch to take a front row seat to watch. We kept waiting for the song. He got really upset and would not watch the rest of the DVD. The New Mystery style DVD's are all I can find. If they would just include the theme song on the extras feature of the DVD I think that would be great. If not I will not buy another DVD
3,Your mileage may vary,"Does not really fit the Northern Tool Powerhorse Gas-Powered Pressure Washer -- 2.5 GPM, 3000 PSI, 208cc (157711) very well; too baggy.The material seems very thin and feels like a cheaper nylon compared to other tool covers I have purchased."
2,It fits,It fits but it doesn't meet with an expectation of lasting very long. It is made of cheap material and I doubt it would last if it was covering outdoors.
4,Will help you train,This DVD will help you hone you pedaling skills. Having an efficient cadence will help you be a better cyclist.
5,Big Russ,For Father's Day I sent my 4 sons a copy of Big Russ. They all loved it. One said he doesn't read non fiction too often and it was one of the best books he has read. He was on a flight to LA for 4 hours each way and finished the book on the plane. They all highly recommend it.Thank you Tim Russert for sharing your Dad with all of us.
4,great book,"Great book. At first, I thought it read a little too corny, but then I realized that it could not have been written any differently. Read this book."
2,Where is Tim's mother?,"I applaud Tim Russert for honoring his father in this way, but for pete's sake, where is Tim's mother in this equation. I realize this is a father-son book, but come on, Mrs. Russert has to deserve a bit of credit for raising ""good and honorable children"".By so over stating his father's role in his upbringing, Tim Russert does a disservice to all mothers of this generation.Sorry, don't waste your time reading this book."
1,What would you think of a guy who...,"What would you think of a guy who is directly involved in a major Washington scandal, the Plame affair, reports upon the affair as if he even could be an objective news source, failing to inform his viewers and readers of his role testifying before the Plame Grand Jury? How about a guy who promotes his own son's radio sport's show on Meet The Press without telling his viewers that it's own son that he is promoting? How about a guy who is Dick Cheney's personal Mr. Potato Head, wears ""Bush/Cheney for President"" buttons on the underside of his suit lapels, and then flashes the buttons at Washington cocktail parties like he WAS the dancing girl in the pasties??? Well, you get the picture...and now this Republican mole in television's Dick-bird seat on Sunday mornings writes a quaint little book about how his propensity for foping his family and servicing the Administration is the greatest thing since his daddie! One star, but only because I can't choose zero stars."
2,Big Russ and me,I am very disappointed in the quality of this CD. The second time we listened to this book it had noisy flaws on the CD's and could not listen to the story.
4,Big Russ and Me,Big Russ and Me was in the condition described. The book came in a timely manner.Cheryl
4,Big Russ,Big Russ will be great to read as I have followed his work and I am glad for your quick delivery
4,Passionate man reveals lessons that shaped his character and work ethic,"Tim Russert shares many stories from his chilhood about his father, baseball, school, and important days in history like the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Of course, I especially loved his stories about baseball in Buffalo and growing up a Yankee fan. An unexpected bonus was learning new things about Yankee icon Yogi Berra. Reading this after his passing, I found it fascinating how many of his early lessons revolved around his mortality. Hearing Russert discuss his admiration for his son and the time they spent together makes the story even more powerful. Indeed we learn a lot from our fathers, and it seems we learn a lot when we become fathers too. I also anjoyed hearing about the lessons he learned from his three most influential teachers."
4,". some good stuff, some old","loved the episodes on storms at sea, hurricanes, and avalanges. But some epsiodes include material from other documentaries and wasn't much of anything new"
3,Toolkit review,This book seems to be an interesting choice to help want to be writers through the steps of becoming an author. It seems to be a bit too wordy and short on actual steps in helping a writer write. Might be the right vehicle for someone else but so far not for me.
5,Good service! Thank you!,I appreciated your fast delivery of Mountains of California that was in excellent condition.
3,A good supplement to the TV episode,"A good book, which copies the TV episode closely, with a few additional scenes. A good book to start with for all TNG newbies, if there is such a thing."
3,Yet another C # conversion,"although the book is ok, it is just another one of these books that has been converted from an origional c # book. This book is also one of those where all's your going to get is a bunch of console examples. I might be biast against this book because I am sick of buying a book on vb.net just to find it was not origionally written for vb.net and there always seems to be confusing code in these books where whomever converted the code to vb forgot a line or 2. When oh when will publishers start writing vb.net books from scratch? Given the amount of these type of books and the over whelming majority of good example online being in c#, I do not see how vb will survive much longer. Anyways if you do not have a problem reading yet another re-write I guess this book is for you."
4,Entertaining Read,"While not as engrossing as the first of the series, this book still successfully draws the reader into the intrigue filled & interesting world of Josephine Bonaparte. The author does a good job of recreating so many of the pivotal moments in the Bonaparte's life without loosing the personal insight of Josephine.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction."
4,A different Josephine,"This book was a new and refreshing view of who Josephine might have been during the time in her life when her husband, Napolean, came into power."
5,Great Book,I really enjoyed this book. I would like to find more like it. Good historical fictions are at times hard to find.a
3,Comments,The picture was shaky and jerky in several of the episodes. The audio was sometimes intermittant and did not synchronize with the image.The price went up by 25% from the ones shown when I bought the first series.
2,Dallas 5,"Problem: One disc was blank, so you miss part of the story. Other than that I was happy with the 5th edition"
5,Excellent,"This is probably one of the best book I read by McKenna, what an interesting way to pay off an enormous debt and then just when you did't think it would be there the happy ending I love so much happened"
3,DIFFERENT,NOT MY USUAL TYPE OF READING BUT VERY WELL WRITTEN AND VERY INTERESTING. I AM GLAD I TRIED SOMETHING NEW.
2,Poor Quality Video,"The content of this video is very good and the katas are taught step by step. However, the video quality is very poor and there is tape 'drop-out' throughout."
5,Holman Bible Dictionary,"This is one of the finest reference works that I have ever seen. The subjects it covers,and they are many, are covered more thoroughly than any other work I have encountered."
1,"Why is it selling for $95.00, when the cover photo shows it at $29.97?","It is ridiculous for this book to be offered at $95.00, when the cover photo shows it being for sale at $29.97. Also, you can go into any good Christian book store and find the book for about $30.00. Beware the price gouging! This one was published in 1991. Look at the one published in 2003."
4,Excellent jump start for Sci Fi,The Fall of Hyperion made Sci Fi jump right back to worth reading. Thanks to my brother for the tipoff. My husband had the book in his hands 5 minutes after I was finished. Back to the store for more :-)
4,Kindle Edition Quality,"For those wondering about the quality of the Kindle edition, it appears that it comes from a similar source as the first book's Kindle edition. There are typos here and there, but not nearly as common as in the first book. Whereas the first book had a few issues per page, this book has something maybe every five pages or so. Also, fewer words are misspelled (""tne"" instead of ""the,"" for example) and the errors that tend to crop up are a missing period or comma here and there. Still slightly distracting, but nowhere near as bad as the job done to the first book."
2,where has the magic gone?,"Hyperion transported me into another world; The Fall of Hyperion left me looking at my watch. Boring. Half-baked ideas...the narrative is not gripping, not in the same league, the same universe, as the classically plotted Hyperion. However, Endymion picks up where Hyperion leaves off (the third book is a gripping read). As for The Fall...leave this one on the shelf."
4,If you read Hyperion - you MUST read this.,"After reading Hyperion, I thought ""There is no way the sequal could match this"". I was right. However, since I had the book in my room, I could only resist it for two whole days.At times, the plot seemed a bit farfetched and coerced (like the Keats persona dreaming the others' lives even after the initial explanation was no longer valid), and other times I thought ""OK, Dan Simmons likes Keats - let's get on with it!"". Overhall, though, it's a great book, with great ideas, and besides - if you've read Hyperion there's no way in hell anybody's going to stop you from reading it."
5,Amazing.,"Granted, the 'Hyperion' books aren't for everyone (staunch opponents of descriptive writing, opponents of 'soft' science fiction, or people who dislike fiction might not enjoy these books), but I enjoyed them immensely, as have the many friends I've shared them with.This second book in the 'series' is substantially different in both narration and plot, but it's still somehow the familiar work of an author whose ideas & writing we can depend upon and enjoy."
2,Not at the same level as Hyperion,This book concentrates more on action that in the psycological and philosofical explorations that are essential to Hyperion. Kind of a let-down.
2,Not as good as the first,Hyperion was amazing but I just could not get into reading this book. Something about the writing style is different and it just doesn't work for me.
1,Not built very well,"While the the has run reasonably well the recoil starter has broken twice so far. The recoil starter is attached to the engine shroud with RIVETs! I haven't been able to find replacement parts or service manual on the web.Coleman's web site no longer mentions generators, so much for support!Next time I'll just go with Honda.This price is about double what I paid for my Coleman at a Home Depot and I didn't have to pay shipping! You can find these much cheaper on eBay.Also, my only experience with Grady's Ace Hardware has been very bad, I'll never do business with them again. I'm surprised that Amazon still carries them."
5,Great tamper,"I wish I had ordered this tamper sooner. It is heavy and tamps much more smoothly than the plastic one I had been using. Even though I measured before ordering, this tamper is just a bit too small....so measure carefully."
4,A Great Romp Down Memory Lane,"Unlike many of the old TV shows Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis stand up well against todays shows. I held off for two weeks before watching the episodes because I wanted to find a time when nothing better was on. Once I popped them in my DVD I watched them all in one weekend. The humor still made me laugh and the music still kept me spell bound.As an added bonus, I noticed small glimpses of history, such as small hints of their fighting and Jerry's early fund raising for Muscular Dystrophy.I only have one drawback to report. These shows date back to before the time that TV camera angles changed every few seconds. The skits sometimes seem to drag on about twice the length of modern skits. This didn't bother me, but a person with pronounced ADHD might not sit through them as well."
1,It's 2010!!!,"I purchased this book on 2003, when not everyone had smart phones....Today, it's not current and it will be inaccurate. Better buy the 2010 or switch to computer or smart phone version."
5,"An insightful parable about learning to manage and balance the stress of modern life, enjoyable for all ages.","Written by family therapist and educator Pauline McKinnon, who has practiced meditation for over thirty years, Quiet Magic is a novel about a boy immersed in fast-paced life and modern technology. Yet only when he falls ill and must recuperate with old Mrs. Fender does he realize that there is much more to life; fresh air, open spaces, nature, the pleasure of relaxation, and the power to take control of one's future rather than let it be rushed and forced. An insightful parable about learning to manage and balance the stress of modern life, enjoyable for all ages."
3,"This book is great, if you're scoring between 500-600","I bought this book in addition to the Official Guide and the Verbal Guide. While it does have additional math problems, they are lacking in complexity and not representative of what you will see if you're scoring much above 600. I found the problems in the Official Guide much more representative of what I faced on the GMAT. So, if you're scoring at a high level, skip this book and concentrate on the last 50 problems of each math section in the Official Guide."
2,Doesn't work with Linux!,"I have an older Omnicube and had attached two linux boxes, one solaris box and one windows box. I needed another KVM and liked the audio component on this device. I also had good results with my old Omnicube, so I decided to get this one. Unfortunately, this device does not work correctly with linux! With one RH linux box and one windows box, everything is peachy; however as soon as you add the second linux box onto this KVM, the mouse goes haywire. I have tried changing mice, switching ports, going between USB and PS/2, and different cables. I finally called Belkin and was told there was one TID for linux and it involved changing the XF86Config to use the PS/2 protocol instead of IMPS/2. Well I tried that and as soon as I restarted X, the mouse went haywire again. I have never returned anything mail order because of the hassle, but this device is useless to me so it is going back!"
1,2 new units break down within 30 days - Lemons or bad products?,"My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations. In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches. I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower. I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen.The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days. At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop). I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again.I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW."
3,"Works, but nothing to rave about","Like other reviewers, I am not very excited about mine:- It was expensive and it takes an unnecessary amount of space on your desk.- The most annoying is the slow response, felt anytime you hold a key down, like backspace for example.- If you have a USB mouse AND keyboard, you will not be able to fit two USB->PS/2 converters side by side. You'll either have to get a short PS/2 extension to move the converter outside the KVM case, or get a USB keyboard with a USB outlet on it.- The flash upgrade feature is useless, Belkin has not posted any updates in a year.But it works, and that's what counts after all, so if you haven't seen anything better, it'll do the job."
2,It doesn't really fit,"This looks nice from a distance, but you have to cut the plastic yourself (it's perforated on the back) and if you're not careful it *will* show stress marks near your cuts. It says to use an exacto knife -- use one. I tried with just a regular pocket knife first but it wasn't a thin enough blade.+ surface texture matches car, looks okay+ the aftermarket stereo I installed slips in the center opening perfectly- DOES NOT FIT into the dash. It's too big. It says in the description that it's supposed to sit ""snugly"", but I don't think my car has shrunk with age. It just doesn't fit and I'm going to have to cut it down on all edges.- The instructions REALLY suck. I have no idea what those metal plates are for. They don't tell you.- It doesn't come with glue, which seems to be the only way to install this thing. I'm not really sure if there's another way, somehow involving those two metal plates, because the instructions really suck as noted above."
1,Tiger's Fang is a lie,"Paul Twitchell wrote the Tiger's Fang in the 1950's for his master, Kirpal Singh. Singh refused to publish it as he believed it was made up and Twitchell didn't have any of these experiences at all. Twitchell then published it in Orion Magazine in 1960. Later, under Lancer Publications he reprinted it, calling it a first edititon but changed the name from Kirpal Singh to Sudar Singh then finally to Rebazar Tarzs.After Paul Created Eckankar early Eck literature has his master as Sudar Singh. Later he changed the name to Rebazar.Now and then the old Orion magazines pop up on Ebay. Find them and read what Twitch said about his experience and whom he called 'Master' then.Tiger's fang is a fictional novel to get Paul's name and face into households, and beef up his bank account. If you get something out of it, good for you.Why should a path to truth be paved with so many lies?Makes me wonder.MikeWiser and better off out of Eckankar"
2,Most readable of Twitch's books,"Think he really tried with this one. And it was a money-maker (shake your little money-maker). Much more readable than any other Eck book other than the one on herbs which was ghost written for Twitchell. I liked it and the ideas, but I just couldn't keep up with the self-hypnotism in the same way other reviewers apparently have. If you're good at self-hypnotism, this is the book for you!"
1,My model frequently failed to detect mouse and/or keyboard,"I used Belkin KVMs (OmniView SEs) in the late 90s and they worked very well; this model failed repeatedly and consistently to detect attached mice/keyboards on start up. If the system wasn't set to the PC that was booting, it was as good as useless, too.I gave up and purchased a different brand. The replacement works flawlessly; I couldn't even sell the Belkin on eBay.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this model. In fact, I recommend you do not buy it."
2,Standard KVM Cables Do Not Fit It,"I purchased this unit to replace one that my customer was using, only to find that I had to buy Belkin cables because standard KVM cable sets do NOT work with this switch. I am awaiting the cables and then I will rate the product function."
3,Who needs a mouse?,"We have this at my work. Only really issue I have is the mouse. Bypassing the KVM switch any mouse works fine. When using the switch, however, the mouse only works on the first device connected. That is, whichever system I hook up to the KVM switch's outputs first gets to use the mouse any time. If I hook up others and select them I have no mouse. Switch back to the original device and it still works fine. If I want to use the mouse on another device I have to unplug everything, then plug in the device I want to use it with. No problems with keyboards or monitors."
2,"Not as good as ""The Collector"" and ""The Magus"" ..","John Fowles is a talented writer, and I think that if you end up buying this book, you will not be disappointed. It has some interesting points in it. Many deep thoughts, some interesting chapters. But, the problem is that I don't think that the story of ""Daniel Martin"" is a good one. It is not fascinating, atleast it didn't raise my interest. At some point I started to dislike this Daniel Martin.. He seemed boring and dull, just like any stupid, chauvinistic, self-centered, egoistic middle-aged man you can see. Maybe there is a point in describing a person like that, but frankly: I am not very thrilled to read about a man like that, I think I've met too many ""daniel martins"" in real life!"
2,Boring...but perhaps worth another chance,"I had read French Leutenant's and the Collector, so I imagined Daniel Martin to be engrossing. I found it dated and plodding. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into it."
3,Well done and smooth,"This recording of Jo Stafford is a fine example of her versatility and you get Johnny Mercer and Gordon MacRae thrown in. Thanks to being digitally remastered you get an excellent sound quality recording. If you like Jo Stafford or this era in music, you will not be dissapointed."
3,Ship To All 50 States,"ShipToAll50 STATES A huge thanks to amazon for offering such a wide selection of gluten free foods that many of us have come to depend on as our on-line source. NOW--AMAZON won't even ship these gluten free products to those of us living in Alaska and Hawaii--not even for a SHIPPING FEE. How rude to get us all interested in your company and increase our purchases through amazon, and then overnight have the opportunity taken away completely, and say we regret this product cannot be shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, (APO/FPO and Puerto Rico). I can understand overseas, but not two of the 50 UNITED STATES!!! Come on and figure out a fee to charge to continue to ship these products everywhere in the US, including ALaska and Hawaii!!!"
3,Too colloquial but otherwise good,"The translations are a bit too colloquial for my taste. In some plays for instance the names are changes, or a character is said to have a Bronx accent! The translators goal was to have lively and performable versions, and they do, so this may not bother everyone.Each play has a simple stage diagram, and some notes on what the stage should be like (eg, the first house should be grand and imposing, but the neighboring house is small and unimpressive). The stage directions are good. Short helpful introduction.The book physically is splendid, with nice easy to read type, and the speakers names in full, offset to make them clear."
1,Good when it works!,"With the battery fully charged, the unit does what it is supposed to. However, beware this product due to the high incidence of defective charging systems. The solar cell which is supposed to charge the batteries during the day is defective 2 out of 3 times. In effect, the batteries are not getting charged during the day (or not enough in any case). What you end up with is a dim, weak light for a couple of hours. I believe this is due to defective units, but there are too many of them defective."
2,"fails to deliver on (preceived) promiss of ""freedom from the power company""","I was diluting myself when I thought this solar powered, LED floodlight would allow me to illuminate Old Glory without having the pay the coal-burning, environmentally-unfriendly power company for the electricity.Sadly this product can't provide the candle-power to illuminate much. Even with a full charge on a bright, sunny day, the light the LEDs cast that night is defuse. The lamp has to be with in a foot of the surface it's illuminating to be effective.This device might be effective in lighting up your mailbox or house number if mounted very close to it, but as a yard lamp, it's useless."
4,Still running 3 years later.,"I keep it outside during the summer and winter in New England. And survived for 3 years so far. I frankly did not expect it :-) Not too bright, but good enough to light the front steps dimly so I can tell if they are ice covered or not. Wish they can be brighter."
4,Works great,"Been using over a month and works great. I'm lighting a small figurine in the front yard. Don't expect it to light a huge area, not what it's made for."
5,awesome game! Very fun!,I finally bought this because we used up the trial and hadn't had close to enough fun!
3,A thur Z,I did find lots of useful information and backgroud history on the liqueurs and drinks discussed in the book.Whick is great for beginners.What I didn't like about this book was the drink recipes where not put in alphabetical order.So if you where looking to make an Alabama Slammer you would have to know to go to the Bourbon section of this book.If you are working behind the bar you dont have time to waste looking through the table of content.I hear that Mr.Bostons Bartending guide is good.
1,Waste of Money and a Test on my Patience.,"Pure garbage. Your $50 would be better spent on a Knights of the Old Republic or any other software where the developers actually removed the bugs before shipping. This game is full of bugs and crashes frequently. My computer is a P4 2.6 Ghrtz with a top-of-the-line NVIDIA (128mb) video card, so I know the crashes weren't the result of my system. If you decide to play, be sure to save every 3 minutes and be prepared to replay your game over and over again. There is an update available, but it didn't seem to matter... the crashes were all the more frequent after the update, especially in Fangorn Forest."
1,Disappointed,You need the latest hardware for this game. I've P4 1.4 GHz with 256M of memory - it is not enough. Motions are jerky - 20 frames per second. Graphics are lacking in details and appears to be 2D animated figures. I expected this game to be like Age of Mythology or AOE.The software piracy routine sometimes prevents the game from booting. Takes a while to boot up not sure if it's buffering the startup movies or something.
4,War Of The Rinng,"For those people who rate this game bad based on the demo, then they say its a waste of money should shut up. When the demo starts it clearly says that it's a PRE-BETA version of the game and there are unfinished things in the game. On my computer the ground is completly grey, I don't know if this is because it's a beta version or if my computer just isen't good enough also. I can't really tell you how this game is because I havent played it in a while, on my computer its laggy also, but again, I don't know if its because its a beta version or because of my computer. I hope I helped you with this sort-of review."
5,GOOD Stuff!,Wow! I just entered this CD into my Delicious Library software and was blown-away at the current value! It doesn't surprise me however - this is truly a fantastic repertoire of Grusin cuts. I remember well my dad listening to the vinyl a lot when it came out. When I started collecting/transitioning tapes & vinyl into the new CD 'thing' - I got this immediately. Good thing - now ripped into the iPod I enjoy it a lot too (you just gotta love the whistle)! Awesome! This CD is a GRP Digital Master.
3,not terribly impressed,"I expected more from this book. I'm already an intermediate player and wanted advanced strategies. Most of the book is just basic information. The best part of the book are the 10 rules, which takes only a few pages. The author uses too much of his ""slang"", especially in the end section. This is the only euchre book I've read and overall, I didn't get much out of it."
3,"Yo...it's a CULT CLASSIC, guys!!","I saw this movie when it first came out, and I think the original title may have been 'Lemora - Lady Dracula'. Weird it was, as well as somewhat silly, and scary it wasn't, at least not much. Some of the scenes were especially funny and would've been good material for a 'Saturday Nite Live' goof, especially when the old hag starts trying to scare this kid.Bottom line is it was a cool period-piece, and it would be great fun to have my fellow baby-boomers over for pizza and to throw it on.Of course I'll have to break out the lava-lites. LOL."
2,Oddball child's tale,"This movie is just weird, not scary, and pretty boring. It is almost like a weirded up story of little red riding hood being chased by a vampire and her little demons. Of course, you have to remember it was made in 1975 and probably did scare children back then. I had to skip chapters just to get through this one! Gave it 2 stars basically for its originality for 1975 standards."
1,"Could have been an excellent book, but ...","...the author all too often chose an awkward and cumbersome writing style. This is a real shame because it spoiled what otherwise would have been an great book. Where were the editors? I did not finish this book and I do not recommend it to anyone. I wish the author could rewrite it, removing the awkward style."
2,Disappointing Kindle Transfer,"This is a review of the KINDLE EDITION.The hardcover print edition of this book is 1,100 pages long and weighs 4.2 lbs. So one can see the significant advantage of reading it on a Kindle DX. However, there are two major disappointments with the Kindle edition.1) NO ABLE OF CONTENTS. Are you kidding me? 1,100 pages, SEVENTEEN chapters, divided into sub-chapters, plus (wait for it) Appendices and no ToC? We know the Kindle does not use page numbers, so how is one to navigate this extensive work?2) AWFUL MAP RESOLUTION. Massive fail publisher. The maps are very difficult to see / read, even on the 9.7"" Kindle DX display. AM I supposed to keep the print edition handy in case I want to reference a map or one of the appendices? Sort of defeats the purpose doesn't it?I know the technology is still maturing, but the publisher and Amazon need to try again."
4,"Uneven, but the ending redeems it","This is a travel-back-in-time story a la ""Big"" and ""13 Going on 30"", but with a twist. In this case, Flora's parents go back in time with her, and only people who love Flora recognize her in her 16-year-old body.Much of the book is shallow and lacks an emotional core, but toward the end, Flora makes a connection with a boy her ""age"" and makes peace with her issues in a believable way. She also manages to make things better for the people she loves as a result of her time travel.Overall, though Colgan's prose is glib without a lot of depth for much of the book, the ending is very satisfying and makes the book as a whole worth reading."
4,The Boy I loved Before by Jenny Colgan,"Jenny Colgan has a wonderful way of telling a story and keeping your attention. Her writing are witty, smart and she has the ability to hold your attention. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. ---Marci Vandercapellen"
3,"A little dated, but still fun","This is one of those charming stories, where guy #1 battles with guy #2 to get the girl - except that in this case, guy #2 is a computer with a rather stubborn personality! The technology looks fairly amusing these days (who would have thought we would need such enormous, clumsy computers?), but the plot and characters are still endearing after all these years. Worth a look!"
4,REVIEW OF ELECTRIC DREAMS ( REGION 2- PAL),"AN EXCELLENT MOVIE ABOUT A STRANGE THREE WAY LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN A COMPUTER, MAN, AND WOMAN.PLAYABLE ON ALL REGION DVD PLAYERS OR REGION 2 PLAYERS. EXCELLENT MUSIC AND HUMOR. HAS ENGLISHLANGUAGE SOUNDTRACK. BUD CORT IS THE VOICE OF THE COMPUTER."
4,wonderful movie,"i saw the movie in 1986 and fell in love with it. and i have been trying to buy the movie ever since. (for about 10 years)i have ck. all local video stores, even before they had the internet.i can not find it,not even in video stores to rent.it has been on tv a few times but never seem to see the ad soon enough.i just cannot afford to spend the money they want for it. hope someday the price will come down.in closeing if you like computers and a great love story and special effects. you will love this movie."
4,An excellent book for people interested in darts,"This book does a good job of describing the basic equipment of the game, and the rules of the most popular games. Silberzahn then gives a concise description of proper dart form and technique. This makes it a good starting point for beginners. Any new player following the advice in his book should improve. He follows it up with a discussion of strategy and practice routines. Again, this is helpful for novice and intermediate players seeking to improve their game. Where the book excels is in its ""Legends Speak"" section. I disagree with the prior reviewer's opinion on the value of advice from acknoweldged masters of the game. Advanced darters will appreciate the professional tips on tournament play from people who have ""been there and done that."" Also, the ""Legends Speak"" section adds some human interest to the book, which is a quality lacking in many other works I have read on improving dart play."
2,Cool on cool,the CD was just as described; it was just that we're not that fond of jazz I guess. Miles Davis is wonderful - if you're into it this is a classic - a little too much for us.
5,HAD TO HAVE IT!!,"I wish I had bought this in my teens, better late than never. This is a must have for any classic jazz collection."
5,cool,"glad to have it at last.birth of the cool was an omen of things to come.tight small sized combo,with deeper sounds."
2,I am not a jazz aficionado...,"... but I do like and own almost all of Miles Davis's albums. I really don't care for ""Birth of the Cool"". The sound quality is great, the musicianship is excellent but it feels clinical and cold. Again, I am not an avid fan of jazz; I do not have the background or education of a jazz fan, but the reason I have such a deep Miles collection is that his music, by and far, is very moving. Not this album. Though technically proficient ""Birth of the Cool"" does not have a mood or ""feel"" to it that I associate with Miles Davis. If you are not a big-time jazz fan per se I would not recommend this as a starting point for Miles Davis; save it for the experts!"
5,Transporting,"It's so refreshing to pick up a book and be immediately transported into its life! There were no pages turned - I walked through every scene as an unwriten member of this Florida community. Frustration with the political quagmire and good-ol'-boy manipulation, passion and romance in all it's phases, and humor found in the oddest situations true to life are interwoven throughout this very enjoyable read. If you want to take a ride down a lazy river overhung with Spanish moss, feel and smell the warm summer breezes of a Florida town, and join their life for a moment in time, all you need is Tortoise Stew. It's good to the last drop and leaves you wanting more!"
1,Not what I expectedNot what I expected,"Should have read the review of this CD more carefully..iy is not original Miller,; rather by a band that plays in THE STYLE of Miller. I was a pre-teen and teenager in the Miller era, and believeme, this is NOT the same! There is just something missing; to quote an expression current in the era, ""it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing""...and it doesn't."
3,overhead nightmare,"Most babies love to fall asleep during a car ride, but not mine, at least not in this car seat. First of all she fears/hate the overhead bar coming down over her. I think she feels the overhead seatbelt to be to confining/restraining. She is very active, attentive to her surroundings and likes to sit up to see what is going on. The seat, although doesn't appear to be bucket, reclines way back when in the most upright position. When/if she falls asleep she will awaken often, for no apparent reason. I can see her squirming around, I think this car seat is uncomfortable for her."
2,Bought it at Toys R Us and returned in 2 weeks.,My son did not feel comfirtable in it. The sheild scared him every time we tried to brin it down. I would not buy it again.
5,comfortsport car seat,"I purchased the item for a baby shower. It was the the person requested, I'm sure it's a great car seat. It has many nice features."
4,pot rack,"it looks wonderful in our kitchen and definitely helps with organization and accessibility. my one recommendation is to have a better stud finder when hanging it, it took forever to get just right, but its perfect now!"
5,An authentic western history,WILD COW TALES is classic documentation of an authentic western lifestyle. It is obvious that Ben Green actually lived the life he writes of. His writing smacks of an authenticity that could only come from actual experience.Very entertaining and informative for those who are interested in ranch life and livestock.The Pleyto HillsHungry Flats: East of Lucia
5,Imagine being there!,What a great look back at what times were like in the life of a real cowboy. Well written. I really liked that he told stories that showed his mistakes and victories. I have shared these books with friends. All really enjoyed them as much as I did.
1,This expansion damaged the game,"I've played DAoC since it's release. i had a great time - original RVR was a lot of fun, and my friends and i could always find a new distraction to keep us occupied. trials of atlantis, coupled with the updated new frontiers ruined DAoC. atlantis is centered around gaining artifacts, earned through absolutely tedious encounters that often require several groups of players. then, you still need to collect three scrolls to activate the artifact - these drop randomly from some creatures, calling for camping toa mobs endlessly. some of these artifacts are so overpowered that they've made players who don't get them obsolete. also, player crafted armor and particularly weapons have taken a serious blow. they can't compete with the perks on toa drops and artifacts. this expansion has pushed many original players, like myself, to walk away."
1,"If your idea of fun is a root canal, buy TOA","DAOC used to be a good game. Read these reviews and many will agree. With the introduction of TOA, Mythic(nerf-champs) has completely ruined DAOC. See the 1.5 star average? That is because so many people are ticked off at TOA they quit and came here to warn potential buyers. People are leaving this game daily with more to leave soon. Do not buy TOA. Do not buy DAOC as you will never ( I repeat, Never) complete any of the trials because once people have them done, they would rather stick a fork in their eye than help you do them again. Stay far far away. Wait for World of Warcraft or EQ2."
1,Don't waste your time,"This expansion took what was left of a possibly good game, and ruined any chance of DAOC ever being balanced. It's just another time sink that's now an absolute requirement to be able to play the game like you used to. In the past, casual players and die hard gamers could compete somewhat evenly in realm warfare, but that idea is completely dead with this expansion. If you don't put in countless hours getting the new items and abilities only offered with this expansion, you are at a significant disadvantage. You also have to go through and put in all that time for _every single one_ of your characters if you want to stay competitive. Don't waste any more time on this game, it's just going to go more downhill from this point on."
5,Adds a whole new dimension to the game,I'm loving this expansion. It's bringing very unique game play and absolutely breath takingly beautiful graphics. Makes you use your brain for a change.
1,"If you enjoy a sledgehammer to the privates, you'll love it","This will do down as the worst expansion in online gaming history. Not only did Mythic(a) impart a campfest when they introduced TOA, they alienated a huge portion of their player-base. Many of those people quit. Then, they have angered the remaining loyal who played by Mythic(a)'s rules and nerfed the crap out of the Master Levels and Artifacts so that after many many days, they are useless. Please do yourself a favor and wait for World of Warcraft or even Everquest 2. Do not but this garbage game."
4,Good information...,...but not enough references. Telling someone *how* you find information is just as important as telling them what the information is.
2,not so little brown handbook,Packed with information this book is not so little could cause a serious concussion if you were to fall asleep reading it. Has information on formatting in several styles including my nemesis APA. Very helpful for any writer.
5,The Little Brown Handbook,"This is a great reference book for anyone with grammar questions. The index and page layouts are brillantly designed by the Parsons School of Design, and it shows on every page. I have never found a reference book so easy to navigate. The book is small (mine is 5.5"" X 8.5"") AND amazingly lightweight for 800 pages . The binding is strong and the book lays comfortably open as you use it. YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. I buy it for every writing job I take. This is my third copy."
5,Excellent,Great book for those wishing to learn or touch up on writing techniques and methods. Especially for those in college. Highly recommended and company too.
3,Excellent info,I rated this 3 stars because while the book is extremely helpful it took forever for the book to arrive. I wasn't sure if it would get to me by the time school started. I'll think twice before ordering from here.
5,Fourteen Years And Counting,"I have been using The Little, Brown Handbook for about 14 years now. I started when I was a freshman in college and haven't been without a copy since. This thing is absolutely fantastic. The layout is just about perfect, it's easy to understand and the index is the benchmark that every reference book should follow. If you write with any kind of regularity, you need this book."
3,Only ordinary,"""Year 1000"" gets off to a good start. The artwork is sound, and the story has a promising start: mysterious phenomena augur the coming year millenium, and possibly the end of the world.Although workmanlike, the story and art never really grab me. The renderings are all good and figures are drawn realistically. They are all static, though, and the characters all seem to talk ""into the camera"". Page layouts tend to have a predictable grid, and don't push the story along as well as they could.The art is good, but lots of other artists are at least as good. The story is adequate, but other stories are better. I'll come back to this book sooner or later, but probably not sooner. In the mean time, I recommend it only to the serious Segrelle fan."
4,First Bond,1962's Dr. No is the first film in the lengthy James Bond film series and it perfectly sets up the series with a great performance and star making turn from Sean Connery as 007. The Blu Ray transfer is excellent and the film is vibrant and really pops.
1,sorrry...,"actually the one star is for the repackaging NOT the film. i bought the anniversary box set and it is a useless bit of trash an d will soon find its way to ebay. why? first, the discs are very hard to remove from the paper sleeves without tearing the page. second, almost all the material in the books can be found elsewhere. i would have preferred a full set of BD that have a continuity of cover style....very dissapointined that to get these you have to go to different 'big box' stores because of exclusives!!!! and, then there is no full set."
3,A Classic,it's like going back to your own home town. Everything seems smaller and more quaint than when you lived there.
5,SEAN!,"SEAN!The ""original"" Bond film.Great fun with Ursala UNdress!This is the film that launched the series and his career!"
5,Dr. No? .......... YES!,"This is the movie that started it all. I hadn't seen it in ages. Watching it I was struck by the sense of menace that went through it. I was also struck by the attitude that James Bond had toward the fisherman, ordering him around like a servant. That was a reflection of Bond's/Fleming's attitude I assume - it was early 60's so racial attitudes were certainly still stuck.I also remember the cells in Dr. No's marble paneled jail. I thought they were cutting edge in style when I originally saw the movie."
4,Magilla Gorilla laughter,I sing the song from time to time and now I had the ability to purchase a product to bring my childhood back to the screen. I love Magilla. After awhile I got a little bored but I'm an adult. A child would probably watch one episode after another but not in one sitting. It's a cute item to have handy.
4,Magilla Revisited,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because I wanted to sharesome of the cartoons I grew up with. What a blast watching them with her.It was great to see Mr. Peebles and Ogee again! Hope I am around to watch them with my grandchildren. A wonderful pick to recapture your youth with your kids.
4,Magilla,goog quality and fast deliver nnn hhh hhh jjj kkkk fffff cccc vvvv bbbb nnnn mmmm ggggg dddd vvvv bbbb nnnn
5,"awsome, when will turner release the classics so we can enjoy them again before we die","good stuff, hey Ted release more"
5,Great product!,These racks are great! They fit perfectly in my jelly roll pans. There non-stick makes them easy to clean up.
5,Unique narrative and re-creation of Bessie Smith's sound!,"The combination of Topsy Chapman and Jim Cullum's Band was a stroke of genius. The narration that ties it all together is quite well written and I got goose-pimples when they switched from playing Bessie's original 1923 recording of ""Downhearted Blues"" and Topsy Chapman's re-creation of it...same key, same tempo...and the VOICE! What could only be inferred from the tinny 1923 recording technology becomes three dimensional and really vivid.Topsy Chapman is a totally committed blues singer here, with perfect inflections of Bessie's style and tone. I have some of her other albums and her own ""voice"" is excellent as both a jazz and cabaret singer, but here she really sounds as if she were born to sing the blues!"
3,Not original recordings,"The CD is fine, just not exactly what I was looking for. Although Jo Stafford sings all of the songs, they are not the original recordings which is what I wanted. The songs are pitched in different keys from the original, and just don't sound quite the same."
5,Just Like My Family Christmases...Only Funny!,"I thought this was such a great idea for a book, but I wasn't sure how it would sound to actually sing the songs. If you can get through them without laughing, you're doing better than I did! Really, Really fun for the whole...Okay, for MOST of the family!I saw a concert in New York that featured opera singers singing these songs, and that convinced me to buy the book for my family sing along. Loads of fun."
3,"REALLY FUNNY, BUT NOT FOR KIDS","The songs in this book are really funny, and I'm sure that many people will find it to be a welcome ice-breaker during family gatherings. However, due to some profanity and other issues expressed in the lyrics, it's not suitable for kids. In fact, I'm not sure I would share it with the adults in my family at Christmas. While my family loves this kind of humor, it's disappointing to see the use of profanity (and God's name being used in vain) in a book connected to Christmas. A gifted author can always find choice, unique words to achieve their goals; they don't have to resort to profanity to make a statement or get a laugh."
1,Power Glide,"Don't waste your money. It is cheap but that doesn't mean you should be defrauded of your money. Product barely worked few times. No power at all and battery does not hold charge. Plastic blue band was so poorly glued on, it came off the very first day. Piece of junk, should not be allowed to be sold as a working product."
5,Wish I'd Written It,"OK, so perhaps you don't need this book, but you'll enjoy it anyway!The best review and tutorial on clusters available, this book is also funnyenough that you probably don't want to read it in a quiet environment."
5,An overlooked masterpiece!,"Jo Stafford sings with former Ellington ulumni such as Ben Webster, with excellent jazz tinged arrangements by Johnny Mandel, Stafford allows all of the musicians to solo, and her vocals never sounded so warm(she had a reputation ffor singing coldly) perhaphs because this is the first real jazz setting Miss Stafford has ever been in, and it suits her just fine. This is an overlooked masterpiece, a must buy for anyone who has an interest in classic jazz, and/or jazz vocal."
5,Totally awesome,Kristin Hannah outdid herself on Between Sisters. It is an absolutely awesome book about the dynamics of a disfunctional family who pull together when faced with tragedy. Have a box of kleenex on hand when you read it though. I just couldn't put it down. I ended up reading it all in one day.
2,It's only ok (if that).,Was a little dissapointed at the cheap plasticky look of the stereo in person. Still at this price it looks better than a lot of other units you could get...at least this one looks like a cheap immitation of something high-end. Would've given it three stars except that right out of the box one of the speakers doesn't work when I play cd's. Both speakers work when listening to the radio though...go figure.
3,Is Barker setting up another trilogy?,"I read this book about 2 weeks ago, and I'm still wondering how this book was published when only one plot line was resolved and the painting they find under the wallpaper had no relevance to any part of the story. There must be more to come or no editor would have let this pass of their desk.I liked the Geordie storyline, which is why I'm able to give this 3 stars, but I really feel a bit cheated that nothing was resolved with Miranda and Fran."
2,Havana Heat Workout not for beginners,"I was very disappointed with this video! I dance various styles of latin dance and was looking for another good workout video with latin moves. However, after trying the video three times, I just gave up. Joby may be a good dancer but this video is not for beginners at all. Could be a combination of video editing and teaching that needs improvement, but it's definitely not one of the best out there. Joby does a variety of steps during the workout and instead of showing a closeup of her feet doing the steps, her upper body is in view. At other times she would switch steps without giving an advance warning and I got lost so many times it wasn't fun anymore. I'll stick to my other latin workout videos ...."
3,a little disappointing,"I was a little disappointed! The vac looked great and seemed to have strong suction, you could feel it when you turned it on. My biggest drawback was the exhaust on the rear of the unit. It blew out hard gusts of air and stirred up more dust than what I was intentionally cleaning in the first place. If this isn't a problem for you, by all means give it a try."
2,Not totally happy...,"Amazon offered this item with an 8-Piece Kit Vacuum Micro Attachment for cleaning computers... You'd figure if they offer the items together as a set that you can actually use them together --- but NO!!! The hose that comes with the vacuum is not round - as the attachments are --- I ended up having to connect the items with DUCT TAPE so I could actually use the attachments to vacuum clean my computer! Also, the carpet & upholstery attachment that came with the vacuum rotated nicely as it should when I attached it to the vacuum --- until the moment I tried to actually use it to clean the seat of my van. The second the rotating brush touched the seat surface it got stuck and it has not worked since! The vacuum is a powerful unit - but I am not happy with the attachments it came with - nor the extra attachment offered with it."
4,Time to Dance?,"Previously, I purchased Teletubbies Springtime Surprises for my infant daughter and she loved it, and since she also loves dancing I thought this would be a good choice. The dvd is comprised of several episodes of the Tubbies united by a theme of musical instruments. You can play the episodes one at a time or all at once. Unfortunately there's not really much dancing, except for the two bonus features which must be played separately. Still, my daughter (now 18mos) does seem to like it, though not as much as the Springtime Surprises dvd."
4,Cats love this...,"I ordered one for my two cats (kittens) and one for my mother's cat. Mine is working fine and my cats really love it and look all around for the light after I turn it off. My mother's cat loved hers too, until it stopped working a couple days after she got it."
5,An Exceptional Gift Book,"I bought a copy of this book for my wife and find myself enjoying it as much as she does.This book is loaded with great ideas about how to plan a romantic evening, vacation or dining experience.It's amazing how creative an author like Barbara Taylor Bradford can be, even when not writing novels. I am certain that this book will become a holiday bestseller. It's really attractive and makes a great gift."
5,Two thumbs up - Nostalgic Jazz,This is an excellent collection of New Orleans Big Band/Jazz. It really takes you back 40 years when Mom & Dad used to play the vinyl.
2,Regal Soprano Standard Ukulele,"I know this is an extremely inexpensive ukulele, so be prepared for it not to stay in tune. What can be done is to squeeze the two pieces of metal behind the tuners to increase the pressure on the ""screw"" threads so they don't unwind due to the tension of the string being tightened to tune it to the right note. If you want a better quality ukulele, you will have to spend quite a bit more money than the $11 I paid for this one."
4,1st Bday Party,Used these banners for my daughters 1st birthday party and they looked great. The colors popped really well with the rest of our pirate decor. I'm pleased with my purchase.
3,Way too much info,The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because I thought the last 150 pages or so were exciting and fun to read. The first half is slow and boring and there are too many secondary characters that were really unecessary.
3,Dark Angles,I liked the book but it left a lot of holes to be filled. Possibly a sequel to the prequel? Will the bad guy strike again? Hopefully.
3,Good but not Through A Glass Darkly,I bought this after thoroughly enjoying Through A Glass Darkly. I was dissappointed in that I really didn't like the character of Young Alice and thought she didn't deserve to get Richard in the end. Also the novel focuses only on several years of the Alice. I was hoping for more on her married years with Richard and the intorduction of Roger. The novel also seems to end in a hurry with a lot of bits and pieces never explained......
5,Eye opener,This book gives a good look into the misconceptions that many people have about the Civil Rights movement. Sowell keeps his examples simple and easy to follow. Anyone who reads this book will come away with a better understanding of what the Civil Rights movement was all about. What makes this book even better is the reader will come away with a better understanding of how the topic of Civil Rights is often manipulated for political gain.
2,Only the Stuff about the Royal Navy is Worthwhile,"Tom Clancy sends some mixed signals in this one. At one point, he concedes that the Royal Navy ""arguably produces the world's finest quality submarine captains,"" but seconds later he tries to tell us that he doesn't think that British submarine captains are better than Americans! Well, which is it? If you would like to read a much more realistic and very critical book on the U.S. submarine force, I recommend Andrew Karam'sRig Ship for Ultra Quiet, which is now in print once again as an e-book for kindle. Unlike Clancy, Karam is a former nuclear submariner, and a PhD, who actually knows what he is talking about!"
5,WOW!,"This book is totally awesome. I am interested in the environment and since this book includes quotes by kids my age, I feel I am really connected. It makes me feel really cool, like I can really make a difference in the world. And it helps. It tells you ways to help the earth- simple ways. And I learned a lot from it. It has a lot of good, interesting facts in it too."
5,Great book for kids,"As a kid, I constantly read this book, and it inspired me to make changes and think about way to be more environmentally friendly. I recently bought this book remembering how impactful it was to me as a kid."
2,I couldn't get this to work at all.,This halter is very hard to use. It is very difficult to adjust. No matter what I did it remained tight around my puppy's mouth. She was unable to pant or drink while it was on. I should have spent the money and gotten a Halti or Gentle Leader.
4,Gripping and compelling characters!,"This novel is far from the average romance novel so many publishers churn out these days. The characters are far from the norm, and don't behave as we often think they should. There were many nice surprises. Just when I thought I could leave our heroine to my nightstand, I would have to read more. Ellen's description of early colonial life is accurate. The attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of their generation breathe through these characters. It wouldn't be hard to imagine these people actually existed and had stepped out of time and into Ellen's beautiful prose. The Light in the Darkness is a rare find--a must read."

1,This product stinks,This is the dumbest thing I have ever spent my money one. I wish I could kick myself all the way back to the store for buying it. It doesn't make cupcakes like picture unless you are going to be Buddy and cut them and all kinds of other crap. If you put to much mix in it the thing rises up like a balloon over the hearts. If you don't put enough it just is mini cupcakes. SAVE YOUR MONEY and do not buy this crap.
4,Big Beat Heat,"This is a good book about the life of legendary DJ Alan Freed. His personal life, as a radio and tv host and as promotor of his own concerts around the east coast.His failures seem to have caused his downfall, a terrible riot during a show in Boston for which he was indicted and also payola, receiving money to play records. Both cases cost him a lot of money and pain.He was married three times, unfortunately the last two wives refused to talk to the author. Jackson says that his third wife Inga was also a heavy drinker, which did not help at all. He died in 1965, only 44 years old"
3,manufacturing problem,"i always love WMF's design and quality, but not for this tea pot. overall quality of the glass pot is fine, the strainer is made of steel mashed wire and there is some metal fringe hanging right around the connecting vertical line--which is not supposed to be made that way--cut my hands a couple of times and damaged the washing sponge while cleaning the strainer. a small but critical manufacturing issue."
2,Not what I expected.,"This movie lacked the luster I expect from Robert Duvall. It was an endless journey into boredom, at least for me."
2,"""Is theah a convick in that theah closet?""","Strange stuff--Duvall rants, gibbers, and fires a shotgun into an empty closet. Haas watches, listens, and smiles a lot. The great James Earl Jones wanders in, scratches his beard and mutters to himself, and walks out again. If this sounds like your kind of thing, jump right in. But nobody's ever going to claim this is Horton Foote's finest hour."
5,Great flick,"I'm a big Robert Duvall fan probably because he's been selective with the stories, and this was definitely the case with 'Convicts.' It's wonderful if you like period history, great acting, directing and cinematography, and enjoy being surprised by grand metaphors towards the end. A young Lukas Hass, James Earl Jones and others made a great supporting cast."
2,I was looking for more,"All of the acting was good in this movie, I just didn't care much to see Duvall walk around all day drunk and mean.Mr. Jones and Robert Duvall should spend their talent on better ventures."
5,"Light, Crunchy and not too salty","I really was impressed with the Wylde pretzels. I had purchased it on a couple of different occassions, but my latest purchase in August 2007 was the best. It seems that they improved their recipes. My children love it and I am planning on reordering some more."
1,Product has been on the shelf for a long time before sending to us,"The expiration date on the package is 09-30-2011, as compared to expiration date in 2012 for the same product we buy from a local store. So the product must have been sitting somewhere for a long time before it was sent to us. Plus it does not taste as good as the one without the sesame. I will be very reluctant to buy food product from Amazon!I was not told that I can not return this item when I ordered it. I would have made a different decision if I were told so."
1,"Awful GF pretzels, buy Glutino instead!","We have tried just about every GF pretzel option out there. Our favorites are the Glutino GF twist pretzels. They are buttery and perfectly crunchy; my kids love them. Even those who don't have to eat GF love them. Amazon stopped carrying the Glutino on their ""Subscribe and Save"" option for some reason, so I decided to try these pretzels as a substitute. AWFUL. They are so crunchy that you almost break your teeth eating them. They have no taste at all. At all. My kids won't eat them. The dog won't even eat them. Amazon is carrying the Glutino pretzels now. Go with those."
5,GF Pretzels a Hit!,"My daughter, two grandsons, and I (all celiacs) think these are the BEST GF PRETZELs! Even the nonceliacs like them too. Highly Recommend!"
4,Essential,"There are perhaps numerous books that devote itself to this subject but not many explore material by the Beatles via critical analysis. That's odd when you consider the most important aspect of this band despite all the hype was the quality of its work. However- ""The Beatles An Illustrated Record"" by two well respected pop music journalists by the names of Carr and Tyler does so. Both critique each album, extended play, and/or single by Harrison, Lennon, McCartney, and Starr then relay to those of us who read such reviews the artistic value this entity possessed. Biographies- rather they be authorized or otherwise- are all good and well but what matters most is what the Beatles were most revered for. This book argues the relevance of this quartet in its almost exclusive discussion of the musical legacy they left behind."
2,Loved it... for a while,"This actually saw about the same amount of use as my larger Glu Bot. That is, until the threaded collar that holds the tip in place failed.The 'lip' of the collar simply seemed to come detached from the rest of the piece, rendering its ability to hold a tip in place useless.Doesn't look like there are tip/collar/lid combo packs are available for this model, as there are for the larger Glu Bot, but I doubt I'd order another one to have it fail in the same way.Bigger Glu Bot is great though!"
3,Trickle size spout,"The overall best solution might already come with the glue. I found the Babe-Bot's spout to be too small, requiring too hard of a squeeze and delivering too fine a bead to be useful for furniture size glue-ups. The small size and easily controlled delivery is better suited to crafts and small projects, where I expect it will be ideal."
1,Must have received a lemon,"My bottle does NOT fit into the the gun. There is no way to grease my air tools with this kit. The pump works as it should, but it does me no good. It is a complete mess to try to use. Wish I could get my money back but I threw away the package."
1,Terrible,When I recieved this product The Cd was partially in the back of the book and was cracked in several places. Let alone it being only half of the CD set. and the book had ooked like it was in the middle of a street in the rain being ran over by cars.I was wanting this CD set to replace the one I had in College that got lost in moving to a new city after graduatig.
2,WHY KLAATU BROKE UP,"the only reason to buy this cd for me is the last song klaatu ever recorded together (WE'RE NOT ALONE).what happened to terry draper?the song writing quality just isn't on this cd.did anyone notice the song COME BACK TO ME is nothing but CALLING OCCUPANTS with different words?how lame is that?terry's vocals are sometimes even out of tune.it sounds almost like this is a rush to get a new cd released.klaatu had that same problem with the endangered species album.but endangered species did have some good songs on it making it a worth while purchase.klaatu's 2005 reunion concert that is on solology is brilliant!terry,john and dee need each other.if you are a klaatu fan and want a solo cd try dee long/outside of time & space.it is the best solo klaatu out their."
1,Terry Draper's Solo is a No Go,"Ah, perhaps a blast from the past I was hoping. A little taste of some of that Klaatu sound? Forget it. Basically a set of songs that go no where and fall flat. No hooks, no catchy guitar licks, nothing. Draper spends his time plodding along singing about his inner self, pondering life, friends, death and whatever else. All accented with home grown production (not a good thing). An aimless, wandering mess. Save your money."
5,Buy Hardcover Edition To Get Reasonable Easy-To-Read Typeface,"This is a good book, but the Dell paperback edition I bought provided obviously shrunken typeface from the hardcover edition, and it is hard to read, hard on the eyes.It's worth paying more to get OK typeface when paperback editions are not re-set so the typeface is OK in the smaller binding format.This is a real issue people should consider. It's important to be comfortable when reading a book and the size of the typeface is important."
2,not his best,"They all sound a bit high to me. these are top guys but they dont shine on this album, SORRY not much good!!"
2,ridiculous technology,"works fine. totally a waste of plastic. wouldn't buy anything that used this technology again. its like a roll of paper, but its plastic and has ink on it. next time, laser toner type. otherwise, ok"
2,"Sure the casting is good, but...","The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, ""We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please."" That's too bad since ""Macbeth"" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" is a far better choice."
4,MacBeth,"Good, but boring visually... I'd have liked a little bit more of the costuming and scenery and less 1970s watching-a-rehearsal style - I think this version would have been great if done as an audio-only version."
5,Great look at the man,"If you love baseball and its players, you should buy this book.Raymond AustinTelevision director of The Saint, The Avengers, Hawaii Five-O, Hart to Hart, Vegas, Quincy, Magnum, P.I., AirWolf, Spencer: For Hire, JAG and many others.And the author of, ""The Eagle Heist"" and ""Dead Again"" from the Beauford Sloan Mystery series."
2,Definitely not Christian Fiction,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the book. While I don't necessarily desire to read books about God, I usually shop in the Christian fiction category in order to avoid curse words and sexual content. Amazon sure missed the boat when they labeled this book as Christian fiction. The writer appeared to have some writing talent, but unfortunately she felt the need to throw in unnecessary curse words and sexual content. And by unnecessary, I mean that the curse words and sexual content lent nothing to the plot or character development. As you get deeper into the story the curse words and sexual content become more frequent so I finally quit reading the book--it wasn't that spelling binding of a plot anyway."
4,good story,really liked the book seeing into getting rest of family members stories.a good coming together book..quick reader finished it fast.
2,Good Story,I bought this book thinking it was written by a Christian author. I only read Christian authors as I don't like to read profanely and sex.
4,Good seat for a good price!,I bought this car seat because it was a good value. It is a pretty good car seat for the price the only thing I can find is that I would change is the location of the cup holder. When installed it sits to far back to reach the cup and get it in and out. Maybe when his arms get longer he will be able to reach it but for now I just use it as a place to store his Binkies. Other than that I have had no problems with this car seat and the pattern is not bad either.
2,Not happy with ours.....,"I thought this would be a good carseat at a good price, but the chest clip is easily undone by a toddler. Our son often unlatches his, so I am looking for a replacement."
2,Not very happy,"I purchased this car seat for both my mother's & sisters car, as they both watch my daughter, and I didn't have big bucks to shell out on three seperate car seats after my daughter grew out of her carrier. The seat worked okay while my daughter was under 1, but now that she is older and moving around more, it doesn't stay very secure in their cars that don't have a latch system.On top of that I was recently faced with the great concern that my daughter (only 15 months old) can undo the latch. I am going to be contacting the company regarding this, because if my 15 month old can do this, how many other parents think there child is safe in it, while they are actually unlatching themselves!"
5,Down memory lane,"Just love the ollection, to bring us down memory lane! If nothing else the theme music was worth getting the DVD!"
4,Excellent Renaissance drama,"Most people think of Machiavelli as only a political thinker; but he was also an accomplished military tactician and playwright. The Mandragola is a classic Renaissance comedy; somewhat reminiscent of the works of Shakespeare or Marlowe, and the play, a farcical work involving love potions, and mistaken identity, and is quite funny even today.Good reading for any drama student interested in the period."
3,Not sized for adult ankles,"The bells themselves are very nice. But the straps and buckles are flimsy. More importantly, they just barely fit my ankles under my pants. Over pants - no luck."
5,Love this oil!,"I love this oil!I use it on my body, hair and to cook with and just love it.It's just would of those great for all most everything oil's.Smells great and feels great on my skin."
2,Horrible Smell,"Despite my bottle saying it doesn't expire until 2014, the moment I opened the lid and safety seal I was assaulted by a horrific smell. I assume the oil must be rancid because it's almost an indescribable smell... sort of yeast-like, definitely nothing coconut-like at all. I usually like NOW's products and they seem to have good quality control, but maybe something went wrong with the coconut oil capsules..."
5,No odor or taste - Great product!,"Despite the other reviews, I have been taking these pills for a month now and have had no problem with aftertaste or odor. They are a little large - but easy to go down.Because of the research of coconut oil with Alzheimers [...] I will be taking these for the rest of my life! They were recommended by my doctor and I would recommend these to anyone that has the Alzheimer's disease in their family!"
3,Eh,"Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me. I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much. It almost makes me gag. I'll be going with Nutiva next time."
3,Food Product Review,The coconut oil arrived in good condition. It had a stronger taste than conventional cooking oils that I did not care for.
5,Camera Bag,"I have a Sony 15 times zoom digital camera I bought this bag for. This bag has adjustable sections for my compact digital camera to fit in right next to my sony Camera. It seems to be well built, has extra pockets, has a zipper closure as well as velcro. It suits my needs perfectly. I'm very happy with this purchase, especially for the price. I did shop around and this was the best deal for the best price."
4,"LIght, portable, convenient pockets","Bought this for my Nikon D40 and used it for 2 years. The build quality is Samsonite worthy, no question there. There are plenty of modular pockets with Velcro attachments that you can move as you see fit, to accommodate objects of different sizes.I could fit in my Nikon D40 with a 200mm lens, the charger, the cables, another 55mm lens, wipes, SD cards, and a cleaning spray.The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because after a couple of years of use, I would have preferred a more longitudinal shape for the bag rather than a rectangular one that keeps bumping into people and corners when you walk.For a regular, non intensive use, this bag works just fine. However, if you will be doing some hiking, walking, traveling around with your camera, a backpack or vertically shaped bag would work best."
2,NOT GOOD FOR REAR FACING,"We had purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our daughter who is 8 1/2 months. It to is supposed to be a convertible car seat, but when we placed it rear facing it didn't seem very secure. I have a 2000 Hyundai Elantra, and my car does not have the latch system, so we had to use just a seat belt to secure the car seat. It would move a lot no matter how much we tried to tighten the seat belt. After much thought we decided that it was just not safe enough in our opinion and we decided to try another seat. I did some research and decided to give the Evenflo Triumph 5 a try. All I can say is ""WOW""! What a difference. We put the seat in my car with just the seat belt, and it doesn't move hardly at all. I am so glad we tried the Evenflo seat, it truly is a convertible car seat and worth the extra money. The Graco might be okay when forward facing, but I wasn't about to keep it that long to find out. Besides, the Evenflo rates higher in safety from Consumer Reports."
2,"Good car seat, but cover comes off too easy",When we first bought this car seat for our daughter I absolutely loved it. However as she became more active she started ripping it apart. I big piece of styrofoam broke off and it's very easy for her to get the cover off. One of is is constantly having to reach back to fix it. It's starting to become a real pain and I'm seriously considering tossing this one and buying one that doesn't have a cover that comes off or one that is better secured. If I had to do it over again I'd probably get a different car seat.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!!!,"I had so much trouble getting the straps secure and it took forever to get it installed. Also, I've only had the seat 3 months and the styrofoam broke in 2 pieces. I called Graco and was told they would send me a replacement piece. When that arrived, I had to completly take the seat appart to get to the styrofoam and then put it back together. Please don't waste your time and money. I am very disappointed with this seat."
1,broke in 3 days,"We bought this carseat due to comfort and ease of installation. While out on a family vacation, my husband leaned on the top of the carseat while trying to get our 15 month old daughter out and the styrofoam insert broke! I could not believe it. We just bought this seat 3 days prior. We both thought if the styrofoam breaks that easily, how is it going to protect our child in the event of a crash. We have since returned that seat to Toys R Us and are currently researching all carseats to make sure we buy a safe seat."
3,"Ok., but",It is very hard to tighten or loosen the straps when the seat is facing backwards. The area to adjust the straps is under the front lip which is up against the seat. Probably will work much better when my son is facing forward. But we ended up just going out to by one that had a side knob to adjust the strap tightness.
3,not great for rear facing,"I recently bought this car seat to put in my husband's car. I went to use it and I had a heck of a time tightening it because since it is backwards, the belt that you pull to tighten it kept lifting up the clip that you use to loosen it. So it would never tighten. I had to undo the carseat all together to tighten it properly. Major pain in the rear. I WILL be returning this on payday to get a different seat that is better designed for rear facing.If you just want it for forward facing, it is a great seat. It is comfortable for my 6 month old."
2,It's A Boy Bubble Gum,"Hi,My first grandson was born and I wanted everything under the sun to celebrate! This is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time! HOWEVER......everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just weren't fresh. These little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock! The moral of the story is that being a ""fun"" item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves....at least they could have been fresh and not hard."
4,A thoroughly professional job,"Red Gold was a very compelling, gripping read, but I think that was largely because I had read Furst's previous books first. His ability to evoke a place and time, loyalties and politics now all but forgotten, is competent here, but not on its top form as in Dark Star or The World At Night. What we do get is more than enough, though, a story about resistance to a highly bureaucratized power with no idea of the eventual outcome. Furst really captures the strange pace of life for a resistor in an occupied country, and his historical realism is superb. Try reading The World at Night before this one, and you might find yourself, like me, unable to stop turning pages."
4,"Great, but....","I bought this on a whim back in the 80's, not knowing what to expect. I found the minimalist, hypnotic music very much to my liking. Shortie's Lament, Moles Are Coming, and Would We Be Alive becoming standard fare in my music collection. Then, last year I bought Three In One. It had all the stuff I thought so well of in Intermission. BUT it also had that annoying voice over on EVERY song. It was like a long-winded monologue with a musical background. Now I'm scared to buy another Residents CD for fear it will be more like Three In One than Intermission. Intermission is worth the money, but I will be wary of anything else by these guys."
5,"""Greatest Hits"" - Great introduction to him","I first heard Moustaki in college, and was looking for an album of his for a long time when I got this one. It's a collection of his greatest hits, and is a great introduction to his style. My favorites (not in order...) Le Meteque, Ma Solitude, Danse, and Bahia."
4,Lost in history,"So, what is Patti's dream?A reviewer hardly caught it during circa two hours comprehensive, music-rich doco of a singer-activist."
2,Tired Rockumentary,"This is a great film for die-hard Patti Smith fanatics but it won't convert or illuminate anyone else. It's your typical indie-rockumentary with the exception that it began filming at a time when Smith had already bought into her own legend. So you get Patti Smith Rock Star not the person who became one. She name drops incessantly, Ginsberg, Mapplethorpe, Dylan, Chelsea Hotel, Gibson Guitars, yadda yadda. Why not throw in Maxwell House? Where there any non-famous people in her life? She reads her own poetry as it were William Blake or Jean Genet. It's not.The film threw me back to a performance I saw in '74 or '75 which really turned me off, she wrapped herself in an American flag and basically ignored the audience. It was all oh-so-political.She says ""I had something in me that had to get out"".So did Kim Kardashian."
4,Nice seat,"I bought this carseat to fit in the back of my 2001 Sentra (which isn't too roomy in the back). It fits wonderfully. I felt that this was a pretty good car seat. However it has its pro's and con's.Pro's: inexpensive, a lot of little extra's including the goodie bag, cup holder, head pillow, and extra lumber padding on top of an already very padded seat, also very nice looking for the price.Con's: Getting the shoulder straps to adjust was EXTREMELY trying...they definately make it seem much easier than it is. Also, the armrests seem pretty cheap considering they ""pop"" into place and are not attached to the seat.Overall I'm happy with the purchase and my daughter loves it!"
1,Not great,I returned this product for a refund. My cat pounced on it and the arms that had feathers on it collapsed. It was not well constructed.
4,A great addition to the cinema of New Jersey....,"Garden State is a prototypical ""independent film,"" and I mean that in a good way. It has all the ear-marks of an independent film: quirky, funny, odd, off-beat, edgy, innovative. Writer/director/star Zach Braff is best known as an actor on the wonderful NBC sitcom, Scrubs. (He brings the same comedic sensibility to this film.) However, he is an honest-to-goodness filmmaker - he went to film school and everything. Like Kevin Smith before him, Braff has made a feature film homage to his native state of New Jersey - those of you who don't live here simply wouldn't understand. He plays an actor/waiter in LA who has to return home for his mother's funeral. Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen. The movie meanders a bit and is probably better viewed at home, but still it is an impressive debut. I hope to see more good things from Braff in the future."
3,"good start, but the ending is just predictable","I was impressed by most fo the film. It was entertaining and different. Also a bit artsy... Then the ending was just very predictable and common. I was a bit let down by that part, because it was like just a cheap ending. Worth seeing however..."
1,maybe I'm missing something...,I don't understand this movie! I know that the main charecer's mom dies and that he inevitably falls in love...but I just feel like I'm missing something about this movie. I've heard so many great reviews and I wanted to likee this movie....but I just didn't understand it!
2,Call me crazy....,"Call me crazy, but I did not like this movie one bit. I don't know if it was simply that I didn't understand it, or didn't connect with the movie, but I found it just plain boring. If it's the kind of movie you can connect with, then definitely give it a shot, but I guess I wasn't even close, because I wasn't even slightly entertained by the movie."
1,No good.,"This movie was horrible. Don't bother. It was boring and depressing and lame. I love Natalie, but she was annoying in this. OK Zach Braff I know you're big time now but this movie was just super-weak. Don't waste your time on this stuff. Go read a book."
1,"So over-rated, pure drivel!","Not even mildly entertaining. Weak script. Story that's been done by many. Obnoxious performance by Natalie Portman. Just very, very bad."
2,Not what I expected.,"I think Firedancer's review hit it right on the nail. I read many reviews on this movie and saw the trailer prior to renting. I thought this was going to be great with everything positive that I heard. I was wrong. Natalie Portman's character annoyed me. All the characters lack depth, I was completely uninspired by the film's end. I couldn't feel anything for any of them. I am very disappointed in this picture. I fell asleep during the movie and had to go back and watch the part I missed, so that speaks for itself. I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this."
1,not worth viewing,"the soundtrack is ok, but its not worth sitting through this movie. Nothing stimulating or redeeming about it. OK acting but no story."
3,Quirky Romance,I love how this movie focuses on the relationship that builds between two incredibly odd people. It is definitely a different romantic comedy/drama. The movie has a great soundtrack that is perfectly woven into each scene like inTime and Tide. Watch this movie and get the soundtrack.
2,A good idea poorly done,"I wanted to enjoy this film but found the characters a little too obvious. Relying on music to further the story became a little trite.It could have been better. Also, shouting into the abyss was a little too obvious.Send Zach good thoughts but save your money on this one."
2,I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it,"The basis of the movie revolves around a succession of bizarre events when Andrew returns to his hometown in New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being gone for 10 years.Other than that, I guess I must have missed the main message. - or I must have been heavily medicated like the main character.Overall I would say the story (one of self-discovery) was OK, the acting was good and Natalie Portman played a believable character. The chemistry between the two main characters is what holds the whole thing together.I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it thou,There are a few funny parts mixed in - like the scene with the hamster cemetery. but that's about it.Maybe rent it or borrow it from a friend"
4,great movie and comes with bloopers!,"i love bloopers - no matter the movie / tv show - i just love it! (guess that's the part of me that likes to laugh - and apparently it's a big part! teehee) so, the dvd has bloopers, but only about 3 minutes of it and most of it is the scene with the dog (if you've seen the movie, you know which one i mean)this is not my usual movie, i like comedies and action movies - but somehow i got talked into watching it and i'm glad i did. it's not a very long movie (another plus) - a little over an hour and a half - and it has a bunch of those ""seriously?"" moments that are laugh-out funny. i also learned that zach braff can act and portray someone other than JD (scrubs) and he can be very good at it. as for the plot, there wasn't much of a one, but that didn't affect the watch-ability or like-ability of this movie"
4,See this - it's well above average,"I'd seen this movie as a rental possibility for a long time, but the description seemed too familiar. I've seen enough quirky, feel-good love stories that I've grown a bit jaded on them. But from the start this one feels different. It is quirky, but not in a canned, contrived way. Each little episode lives and breaths on its own. I laughed out loud several times. Natalie Portman is great. Her role here reminds me of the child actor she was from Leon (The Professional), and that's a good thing. She's versatile and full of life and bubbling with humor. So, it's not that anything in this movie is surprising. It's just that its done so lovingly, with great care and craftsmanship. Zach Braff obviously wanted to make a lasting, quality film. He's done that, and this one will last as a favorite just as Say Anything or Heathers or Edward Scissorhands has. And yes, the soundtrack is great, setting the mood and tone of humor perfectly."
4,Lovely & Wonderful,"I had heard about this movie from a friend who said they didn't like it. Awhile later my mother bought it and asked if i wanted to watch it. corce i said no. later during a sick day i got bored and watched it anyway. I was blown away. it had the most wonderful story line, and an interesting plot. it was that kind of movie that i had to go back and watch again because i didn't catch it all the first time. there are some amazing secnes in this movie but i don't want to tell anyone anything cause i want you all to find outfor yourself how good of a movie it is. I give it 4 stars because it was something that i really ahd to use my brain for while i watched it other then that it was one of the best movies i have seen. a romance, comedy, and drama all into one simple yet powerfilm. brovo!!!"
3,"Quirky, twenty-something saga","You know the story--a young, numb, marginally successful Hollywood actor returns home for his mother's funeral, leaving his anti-depressants--a truly impressive array--behind. In the space of four days he revisits his friends--all losers in their own way--, finds the love of his life, kicks his mind-numbing therapy and forgives his father for severly over-medicating him for some 15 years. I can see how this appealed to younger movie goers, but I couldn't quite swallow it all. Andrew's ability to overcome these obstacles almost instantaneously was unrealistic, and I thought the movie lacked a point of view about the events around him--particularly about the father, whose conduct was grossly unethical, and Andrew's despicable friend Mark. I guess you have to be twenty-something. . . . ."
4,Pretty Good,"After having to put up with all my friends talking about this movie and raving on and on about it, i finnaly had the opprotunity to see it for myself. Overrated. After waiting to seeing this movie I realized it wasnt near as great as my friends made it out to be. Garden State was fun to watch, with its unique characters and interesting camera shots, but all in all i feel there was to much hype over something that was just alright. The thing i most enjoyed about the movie is the soundtrack. Overall it was good but just not as great as everyone says it is. I recommend watching Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind if you're looking for a unique romance."
5,It is black and it's a Grab Bar!,"Upon initial inspection, it seems to be decent in quality and solid powder-coated finish. Unfortunately, I won't be able to review how it holds up as I didn't realize it won't fit my Jeep due to the front Roll Cage pillars, so I will be trying to sell it.IF it had fit my application, it would be in use now. For a standard CJ with no modified roll cage, it should do well."
1,Studs are too short!,I bought these earrings for my wife but it turns out that the studs are way too short. My wife has average-sized earlobes and has never had a problem like this before.
4,14k Yellow Gold 5mm Ball Studs,The quality of the earrings was nice. I had to return them because the posts were too short for my ear lobes.
5,"Great Earrings! Shiny, Dainty, and Elegant!","I purchased these not deciding if I were going to keep them or give them as a gift. I ended up keeping them because they go perfect with my earring collection and will come in handy when I need something simple and pretty. Very happy with the purchase. They look great with white gold, platinum, or silver jewelry. Next time I'll get more as a gift."
5,very nice for the price,they are nice however little smaller than I thought but that's my fault for not bringing out my metric rule... Very much recommend
2,gold ball earring 5mm,These are very small at 5mm but the big problem is the earring backs are really really small and too hard to hold on to. I won't be wearing them much as they are hard to fasten.
2,how to measure,"This purchase was very disappointing. Yes, the gold ball is pretty, but it measures less than 4 mm! I did not want to spend the money returning them, so I wear them once and a while, but I am not happy about them at all. So much for trusting information on the internet. Next time I'll buy them in a store, so I can see what size they really are."
5,Pirates of the Caribean trilogy,Disney at its best. 3 movies that are a must have for any Blu-ray collection.
5,Second Best Trilogy Next To The Original -Star Wars-,"I loved the series. It was a great idea for a movie in Curse of the Black Pearl"" and got a whole lot better with ""Dead Man's Chest"". The third movie, ""At World's End"" was a bit dissapointing to me, but that's because I had high expectations after watching ""Dead Man's Chest"". This is a must have trilogy, especially on Blu-Ray. You won't regret buying this."
2,Ho Hum,"The premise is that the majority of women are unsatisfied. Communication and techniques are the solution. The good news is that this short book focuses on exact techniques (you can move your tongue up-down, sideways, in circles, figure 8s, etc.) which can be the basis of communication and sharing with your partner. No really new ground here.Everyone sees this book differently, just as they see sex differently. Everyone wants to be a good lover, but some have difficulties. Men and women need to work together, to talk, to discover. Neither went to a secret school to learn how; we're all literally and figuratively fumbling in the dark....""Joy of Sex,""""Becoming Orgasmic,"" or even mykm.com are better choices."
5,I didn't know sex could get any better until I read this,"This book has changed my life. I picked it up on a whim, but I was totally unprepared for what it had to teach me as a woman. I've been sexually active since 1971 and thought I knew everything about my own body's sensations. When my husband tried out some of the ideas in this book..... I was totally amazed, not to mention thrilled. I really appreciate the point the authors make about how a woman should be getting as much satisfaction from a sexual encounter as a man. It has revitalized my marriage. Every man should seriously study this book if he really loves his woman."
5,A good thing to give a bachelor at his party,"I was given this book from my older sons when my wife and I split up and devorced. I studied it and learned everything in it so that when I got with someone else I would be prepared. It worked so well when I got with my beautiful new love of my life, that I handed this book down to my younger son at his bachelor party to study experiment with his new wife. It teaches new techiniques in a classy and loving way. It brings love making back to being fun.....not just porno sex talk."
3,"For the ""Older"" Crowd","Kim and her husband have their hearts in the right place..but this book needs, how shall I say it, more ""ooomph!"" This book is great for someone who has never touched a s*x manual in their lives (or have touched very few..no pun intended). It is clear, explicit and educational. But it may bore you if you read other material about the topic. I didn't buy it through Amazon and was unable to look at it prior to purchasing it because it was the only copy and was shrink wrapped. Had I been able to, I probably would have sat down and read the book at the store. When I read it, I was done in 15 minutes. There isn't much to it.Let me reiterate, however, if you are in a relationship where you are not familiar with ""fair"" techniques, this book may be for you. However, if you regularly read women's magazines and/or other books about this topic, you may want to skip it.I would presume it is probably a best seller because of the author so don't let that fool you."
3,I haven't read it,I bought this book for my friend. She read some of it and thought it was good. The service was great.
4,"Lucado 3in 1 The grip of grace,whispers your name, applase from heaven","Lucado is one of my favorate writers... This book did not disappoint me in anyway..The book was in very good shape and got here on time... What else is there to expect from a book store?Thanks,Cliff"
5,elizabeth r,this is a must have item for all who enjoy this genre. the bonus disk was also great. all very relevant.
5,Elizabeth R - Tudor History,"Bravo! This is an excellent reaching tool for anyone interested in Tudor History. Unlike recent films on the Virgin Queen, this PBS 70's version is far more accurate to historical fact. Glenda Jackson's performance is excellent. This version starts with a young Elizabeth, during the reign of her brother Edward VIII. It also shows her life after the death of her father King Henry VIII, with her Step-Mother Katerine Parr - so the range of this drama covers a life time. Historical and Enjoyable, well worth the purchase."
5,Elizabeth R,"Superbly acted, historically accurate(!) and one of the Masterpiece Theatre's finest moments all around: Cast, costumes, staging."
4,An entertaining read...,"This book is a great story for anyone who wants to curl up on a cold day. The characters are rich in description and you feel as though they could be any number of people you know. Even though I'm in Canada and they are in India, you feel no distance since the story is human in every aspect. The author weaves a wonderful and interesting tale."
3,"Looks Sharp, but....","Very stylish and attractive watch. I had to take out 2 links for it to fit my wrist and I'm a pretty big guy. Removal of the links may prove difficult for most. I had to make a tool to get the job done. I would recommend taking it to a jeweler. Be Careful Fossil claims the watch is ""Water Resistant"" to 50 meters, but the first time I washed my hands with it on the crystal fogged within an hour. I had to pop the back off and let it dry."
4,Queenly Insights,"The author is sometimes outrageous yet outspoken in some of his assumptions and observations about those who attend and enjoy opera and those singers and other musicians who perform these works. Some may disagree vehemently with some or all of his consclusions, but no one who reads this book will be without an opinion - either agreeing wholeheartedly with the author or having a ""hissy fit"" over his ""over-the-top"" arguments and perceptions. It is amusingly illustrated with occasionally very droll captions to go with the archival photos. On the whole, this book is a pleasant diversion for before-bed reading and may keep you from falling asleep with some of the author's ""apercus"" in mind"
5,Eye-opening review of Jesus' life,"Lots of recent writers delving into the life of Jesus would do well to go back and read this 1911 book by Albert Schweitzer. I read it in my youth (age 19) and now over fifty years later, it is still stunning for its objectivity of mainly German biographers of Jesus. Schweitzer's faith is obvious but it isn't objectionable from a historian's point of view."
4,Collectable collection,"Tremendous collection. Many great imaginative stories, especially ""Gonna Roll the Bones"" by Fritz Leiber. What a piece of work! I'd recommend this collection to anyone who digs off the wall ideas, especially the above mentioned story; amazing. To me, that one story is worth the price of this volume itself."
2,"Long Live the ""Golden Age""!","Fritz Leiber distances himself from the other authors in this book in that his story, ""Gonna Roll the Bones"", has a story and understandable characters, even if those characters are not admirable. If there is a way to find this story in another collection, I would recommend finding it there. The remainder of this book is not intended to be enjoyed. Instead it is intended as a rebellion against SF authors from the ""Golden Age"".My suspicion is that Harlan Ellison intended to ""revolutionize"" SF with this book, but all he wound up doing was showing that revolutions start with ideas, not declaring ""Revolution!"". The irony was that a ""Golden Age"" author, Leiber, wrote the only quality story in this anti-""Golden Age"" book."
2,Poor service and ill fitting product,"I purchased a set of floor mats from Coverking (thru a reseller) for a Mercedes Benz 350SDL. When I received my product it appeared the product was for a Mercedes 350SD. Compared to the original floor mats, Coverkings front floor mats were ill cut and the rear mats were 5"" short. I contacted the reseller who tried to contact Coverking various times, by phone and email, without success to remedy the situation. The reseller refunded my money in the end and apologized for the unfortunate experience, which was beyond their control. Coverking's website indicates the product is for the 350 SDL which it clearly is not. I will not buy another Coverking product after this experience."
3,Accessories Galore,"This is a good book, however, one should keep in mind that one can only use so many accessories presented. I gave this three stars as I thought it was overpriced considering that any one person would only use a few of the ideas & instructions presented. It does come with patterns for the projects, which is very nice. I was inerested in handbag ideas and I thought, for some reason, it would have more handbag illustrations. I am trying to keep in mind that any one book will be reaching many people and for every design I am not inerested in, many others would be interested."
1,Mary Mulari's Accessories With Style,"This book was laughable, the sewing projects lame. Total waste of money. I bought it as a result of good reviews so I guess the reviewers had different expectations to mine."
5,Colored Waiting Room,The story is well researched and written. The story is thought provoking and inciteful. It is also very close to the experiences that many black women go through in their lives.
4,Why should you read this Book,"I have this book and find it very educational in a way, that no white person will ever experience this and should see what really happens to some of the black people here in the us. The author must have first hand knowledge and still finds it in her heart to be kind to others and loving. We cannot go in life with our eyes closed that this does not happen. It does and still contiues. When will it stop????? I do wish the author the best and hope that this book will reach many. Best wishes Patty, sending you lots of love."
3,colored waiting room,"This book reads like a non fiction account of life in rural Tennessee, in the life of a black female officer. It tells the story of Alberta, who dares to wear braids in uniform and stands up to the other officers to don't want a woman especially a black woman with her position there. Alberta endures bigotry,fear, disrespect and fights back respectively, but the waiting game continues. I say it reads like non fiction because a some point this has happened to some black female officer somewhere. The book was well written and a good read. I give the book *** 3 stars.Debra Owsley"
5,Brilliant,"I first read this in college, more than 40 years ago. It is a classic inventory of the world's nativistic, messianic and millennarian religious movements. This is the place to begin."
5,Comparison to others,I've been using this kind of product for many years. This Mayfair seat is far superior to any of the others. It is well constructed out of much heavier material and I am sure it will outlast any of the previous ones. When this seat has to be replaced I will not have to get down on the bathroom floor and undo the scruffy bolts. The new seat will attache to the existing nylon bolts without tool in seconds. That alone is a great selling point.
3,I'd rather listen to Opeth.,"This is a decent album and everything, but it in no way compares to that of other bands like Opeth (not to be confused with the horrible band Otep). ""Midian"" has some great songs, such as ""Her Ghost In The Fog"" (which I believe is probably the band's best song ever), but this record can also be very irritating and annoying as well. The main reason? The singer.If this was just a musical album without any vocals, it'd probably get 5 stars. Musically, every song on here is brilliant. However, the vocalist sounds like a yapping dog that's been shot. If you can get past the irritating voice of Danni Filth, this really isn't that bad of an album."
1,Yuck,"Since I liked CoF's earlier realeses, I was really hoping for their new CD to be good. Everything from the songwriting to the production is not as good as the old stuff. What a waste, lets hope they can come back with another good CD next time, or maybe its best for them to go down under. This CD is no good, not recommended."
1,May I barf????!!!!!,"Yuck!!! I cannot believe such a talented band was able to produce this disgracefull album. I mean, COF- one of the best Black Metal bands ever (well not anymore) have totally lost thir value to me by putting this album out. You want quality Black Metal? buy their first four albums. You want Hip Hop Dance Metal? then by all means buy this cd."
2,Cradles last attempt,"This album is nothing compared to the cradle of filth the i listen to. I am talking about there early work such as Supreme Vampiric Evil,Dusk and her Embrace,Vempire and dark farie tales,Cruelty and the Beast,THAT IS GOOD CRADLE OF FILTH.THIS IS BAD CRADLE!!!!VERY BAD.In my opion there is only 2 good songs on the whole cd,which is Safforon's Curse and Lord Abortion.Everything else sucks major a##!Buyers Beware!"
3,"Good, but not the best","I first got into CoF with Cruelty & the Beast. When Midian came out, I ran to get it. I wish I hadn't. It's a good album, but it could be better, given CoF's stature. With Midian, they seem more like they HAD to do this album, not WANTED to do this album. The only good song on here is Lord Abortion (It's about necrophila! hehe!). Their earlier releases are good, as they are of true Filth fashion. This one just doesn't seem to have been put together right. Plus I don't like it because there drummer Nicholas isn't with them anymore. He was the best they had!So, if you want a good album, I recommend Cruelty & the Best. It's a much better album. At least to me. Whoever I am."
5,"I never thought I'd say it, but...","""Dusk... and Her Embrace"" has been surpassed as Cradle of Filth's greatest masterpiece. ""Midian"" is just too incredible for words. The vocals, as always, range from the most god-awful screeching to low, guttoral growling, to operatic soprano. The haunting melodies are brillianty juxstaposed with fast, abrasive drumming and masterful guitars. The lyrics are more beautifully poetic and disturbingly twisted than ever. This album gets in your head and stays there. And as a nice bonus, this album also has the coolest cover and sleeve art CoF's ever had."
4,Truly amazing,Midian is one amazing album. Its not the first CoF album I've bought and it sure as hell wont be the last. Unfortunatly Robert's bass is lost under the guitars and Adrian's drums sound pretty much the same on every track but its still the same old Cradle who have released masterpieces such as Dusk...and her embrace and Vempyr. Again its an amazing album with Danni's vocals soaring to new hights(and lows) buy it buy it buy it!!
5,over-whelming beautiful,"as the essance of the movie nightbreed, this album captures everything. From dani's perfectly placed screeches, sarahs operatic voice. To Doug bradley's voice [pinhead] talking in death magic to adepths, and her ghost in the fog. The drums, bass, and gutairs from start to finish are brillantly done for this dark, hard, sad, and beautifully done gothic musical story of midain - the hidden city where the monsters live."
5,schiztophrenic metal...just a different face we see,"CoF is band that shows a different face every time they put out their next cd. Different theme, different sound, different speeds. This is just another face of CoF. Midian to me, is a masterpeice. Great songs, great writing, incredible musicianship. And to those CoF fans that think every CoF cd should sound the same. It gets boring..real fast. The only thing I hope they never lose it the brutality, the heaviness, and the speed. As for Midian..I'm 39 years old, so I've heard it all..CoF possess originality and talent. And so far it shines through. And they even show they have a sense of humor (read the lyrics). This ranks right behind dusk, by a hair. And finally, it's just a blast to listen to. Buy or die."
4,Theological briar patches,"Hauerwas has a reputation as a sort of theological curmudgeon, but in reality he is as clear a thinker as we could hope for in an ethically confused time. And he reveals himself as deeply human at the same time. This survey of his work helps me think my way through many theological briar patches - whether I agree with Hauerwas or not.Readers who like the way Hauerwas combines breadth, depth, and compassion with a stringent ethical vision will also want to read Heroism & the Christian Life by Brian Hook and Russ Reno."
2,Gold Panning in New Mexico,"This book/pamplet is not completely worthless, but close, and very much over priced. The book has some locations that may or may not exist now, nothing you can't find out by contacting NMBLM or the area you want to go to.I saw this book offered for as much as $98.00, decided on the $28.00 price, and when it arrived found that it had a $9.95 faded tag inside the cover. Oh-well, sometimes you don't get what you pay for.I will be very very careful when I buy through AMAZON again. The book over-all is a joke. Amazon, what can I say."
3,WCW Beach Blast 1993 Review,"Now this PPV was well done, I've watched it both on PPV (not live, borrowed the tape from someone.) Now in the regular PPV it had somewhere from 7 to 8 matches but when I viewed the home video version I learned that it only had 5 matches, but they were good ones. It had matches like Johnny B. Badd vs Maxx Payne, Horsemen vs Hollywood Blondes for the tag straps, also Sting and Davey Boy Smith vs The Masters of the Powerbomb (Sid Vicious and Big Van Vader). The only reason I gave it less stars because it's missing matches that was on the PPV, this should have been more like a PPV video, but other than that it's great, especially the tag title match."
2,Paper Poppies: A Memoir,"There is much in this book that will appeal to those who enjoyed classics such as the Diary of Anne Frank or the Hiding Place. Set in World War II Russia as Communism runs rampant, it chronicles the pensive musings of a girl trapped not in a prison or concentration camp, but a hospital bed. Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight. Marianna's reflections may provide a valuable guide to those who face similiar trials in any age, showing a new way of measuring strength. However, the rambling quality will be off putting to many.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Very difficult read,"Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read."
4,It was great...of course...,"It was great...of course. Roberts never lets you down. Everytime you pick up one of her books you already know the outcome; you're going to get romance, mystery, comedy and a well researched plot, of course there are never really any surprises, but that's ok by me...I know I'll always get my money's worth!"
4,one of her best,Roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer. This is a gripping story...I was glued to the book till the very end.
5,"Wonderful, Marvelous! Her Best To Date (May 2005)","I really enjoy Nora Roberts, but had been disappointed with some of her books that I had read lately. (Of course, they were her earlier works or the Harlequins, so it's kind of understandable.)BIRTHRIGHT delivers!If you enjoy a mystery involving kidnapping, illlegal adoptions, some murder and mayhem, AND the excitement and intrigue of an archaelogical dig, this is definitely the book for you!The dialogue is fun, ""real"" and snappy at times; sweet and relevatory at others.The best part about the book is that the ""secondary"" couple are just as interesting and just as well developed as the ""primary"" couple. This is unusial in this ""type"" of book and unusual in hers to this degree.Plus it's a real page turner! I read it in one sitting, and believe me, after just having major surgery and being quite uncomfortable, that's saying something!Buy it, enjoy it! I think you'll LOVE it! It's a great read for folks who aren't fans of hers az well!"
1,The worst Nora Roberts I've ever read,I love Nora Roberts. This book just didn't make it for me. I didn't care one iota about any of the characters. I felt like the dialogue was coming out of nowhere.I really liked the plot. It was the best part. The romance was boring and unnecessary.I usually love anything that Nora puts out. I'm just glad I got this from the library instead of shelling out $25.95.
2,It's dragging on and on and on,"I am struggling to get to the end of the book. Too much going on and it drags. Three relationships, baby kidnapping, archaeological digs, murders and more. Too many threads and the pacing is thrown off by it. I find the lawyer/brother relationship completely superfluous and detracted from the pacing. It's plodding to the point where I am wondering why I am still trying to get through the book and no longer care about any of the tangle of threads going on in this book.I am listening to the audiobook version and I also have to add the narrator is awful. The hero (after you figure out who the actual hero is because of all the threads in the story) sounds AWFUL. All the male voices are terrible. Gravelly and I want a throat lozenge after listening."
2,Birthright,I was not able to fully enjoy this book like I had some of her other stories. Maybe the next one .
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS,LEO AND LAURA DID A GREAT JOB WRITING THIS BOOK. I CAN'T WAIT ALREADY FOR THE 2004 ALMANAC TO COME OUT!!!!
2,A little too charmed for my taste,"I read most of this book, which at times were very funny and cleverly written. However, she praises her own mother for being The Perfect Mother, has no financial concerns to speak of, a passel of supportive familial babysitters, and cares way too deeply about dressing her daughter Lucy in perfectly matching clothing.It seems as though the author's work and family life are so darn perfect that I felt alienated from her and her experiences.I don't live in that kind of world, I live in the world of wierd families, financial worries, job concerns, etc. I much preferred the down-to-earth, reality-infused humor of ""Diary of a Mad Mom-To-Be""."
3,average new band,This Cd is okay. Many of the songs sound similar. It's not bad if you don't mind average listening. If you're expecting something fantastic you will be disappointed
5,"By far, the best band I have heard in a LONG time...","I found these guys on Myspace, liked the songs they had on there, so I went out and bought the cd. It's AMAZING. It's one of those CDs that you can listen to all the way through and not get tired of it, no songs that you have to skip. Every song is unique, and you can actually feel what they're singing about. Great band, great CD."
2,Blehhk.,"Okay, so, this CD was on my listen to list for maybe a couple months but I just never got around to it. Then earlier today, I was disappointed. Possibly the only good songs on this CD are Face Down, and Your Gaurdian Angel. That's all I'm gonna say. So yeah. If you like this kind of ""Ooh, look at me, I'm trying to be so hardcore"" stuff. Then this CD's for you. If you don't, then don't even bother. All i have to say is...Blehhk."
4,80's Party,"This was great, we had an 80's theme birthday party were we had the music video's going on in the back group! It was a great touch!"
3,good,This item is my 2nd one the 1st one didn't work. But they were fast to ship out new one and this one works great.
3,what lisa knew,This was a very disturbing but enlightening book about the abuse of a young child and woman that led to the child's death. It gives insight to what society did or did not do to help victims back in the 80's. This book was hard to read but hard to put down too.
4,Great toy that takes a while to destroy,"My boxer loves these. He plays with them all the time. Gnaws on them too. They'll usually last about a month or so, which is pretty good because he takes pride in dismantling toys."
5,rocks,this cd rocks. It is the best cd that smash mouth has put out. The song all star rocks. It is the best.
2,Teeny Pop Rock,"Honestly, come on - i mean - I was utterly surprised to see that anyone besides twelve year old pre-teen males had reviewed this album. From the cover to every single track, it just screams ""Hey! Look at me! I'm Astrolounge! I'm just now growing body hair! Wait! Wait! I think my voice is changing!"""
1,Yawn inducing pop music,"Been there, done that. That's the first thing I said to myself upon listening to Smash Mouth's latest album ""Astro Lounge"". Many of the songs on this album sound like rehashes of the last album's hit single ""Walking On The Sun"", so you might like this album if you enjoy hearing the same song over and over again. The songs are punctuated by dumb lyrics (""Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play""), watered-down ska-pop riffs and something of a spy-music fixation, which goes nowhere fast. The worst of the lot is ""Waste"", a ballad so insipid and dull you would swear it was the latest 'N Sync hit. ""Come On, Come On"" is a decent track, despite being written for a commercial - heck, you can even hear ""All Star"" and ""Then The Morning Comes"" in commercials as well, so you will probably be sick of them once you buy the album. This band definitely doesn't warrant the overexposure they have received upon the release of this album."
1,I can't believe it,"Fush Yu Mang rocked, every song on it was great so naturally I figured this would be the same. I was wrong. This is horrible its nothing but played out radio songs and boring mindless junk. If you liked the first album leave this one alone."
3,ALL-STARS,"I have only heard All Star and Can't get Enough of you baby, but, i can't get enough of them! All star has a catchy tune, and great lines, so that anyone can catch on."
5,Smash mouth is back and stronger than ever!,"When I heard ""I can't get enough of you baby I knew this would be a good cd but when I heard other songs like ""All star"" I have became even more anxious to get it. I have heard only a few songs but I am sure the rest will be great."
3,A mild success,"This album contains some interesting ideas but many of the songs end up sounding alike and do not have the driving rhythm of All Star or Walking on the Sun. If you loved Smash Mouth before, this might be a good pick. If you are big into All Star but don't know much about Smash Mouth, it might be best to hold off."
5,Awesome CD!,"I love this CD! At first I bought it for ""Allstar"" but then I saw that the whole CD is great. Many other times people buy a whole album for one song or two. I've been a Smashmouth fan since I heard ""Walkin' on the Sun"""
3,Pretty good,This CD is alright. I am sure I could get more into it if I listen to all the songs lol! I never really made it all the way through...there is better but I do like come on come on and then the mornin comes does rock. I'm just to busy listening to blessed unioun of souls to listen to astrolounge@
3,Not as good as the first,"Smash Mouth's second album is decent in itself, but if you have already heard the first album, it is very different. The first album is a style all it's own, and the tracks almost run together into one song. But Astro Lounge has very evident pop influence. The first four songs are very unlike the previous album. #5, all star, starts to return to their original style, and it gets beter after that. A good album, but not as good as Fush Yu Mang. Make sure you get Fush Yu Mang before Astro Lounge, so you really appreciate Smash Mouth's true style."
1,[BAD!!!!],This CD is so [Bad]it isn't even funny! I hate it. It's all mellow and it doesn't have any good beats. I suggest you don't buy this
2,Only four good songs...,"There are only four good songs on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
3,It was okay,"I like All-Star, and that's about it. The songs sound somewhat the same, but they just drone on and on. If you really LOOOOve Smash Mouth's sounds, then you'll want to get this. If you think they're either ok or like a varitey in artists' songs, I don't think you'll want to spend money on ""Astro Lounge""."
2,good and bad,"This CD has its share of infectious tunes such as All Star, Then the Morning Comes, Diggin Your Scene, etc. But it seems to me like the ultimate sell-out album for SmashMouth, which can no longer be considered a punk-ska band. It's retro feeling gets a bit old after awhile, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,"It was, well, okay, i guess, just okay..........","Well, i like Smashmouth, ""Walking on the Sun"" is one of my all time favorite songs...however, this album is not that great, to say the least...""When the Morning Comes"" is the only song I love, and ""Allstar"" was good expect they had to sell it to every comercial and every movie and whatever...What i am saying is if you like Smashmouth, go buy Fush Yo Man, it is much better, but Astrolounge is relatively a waste."
4,i bought this cd because....,"it had a good cover. or whatever. anyway, it is a cool cd, with the exception of some songs like road man and stoned (which are still funny anyway). it has a mix of stuff like all star, diggin your scene (sounds like walking on the sun) and satellite ( a cool loungey song). Anyway go buy this and if you dont like it return it and get something else. you cant lose!"
3,not as great as the last,"smash smouth searches and searches for that hit on the album, but they can't find it."
4,"Happy, Fun, and Energetic","This CD was definitely worth the purchase. It is the perfect CD to take with you to the beach! Most of the songs sound the same, but that's okay, I don't really mind! If you listen to the CD like about once a month, you won't get sick of the songs. The song I really dislike is ""Roadman."" It's just not my style! And ""All Star"" is another non-favorite. It got so overplayed on MTV and the radio, and the song just bothers me now. There are a lot of good songs, but my top 3 favorites would have to be ""Can't Get Enough Of You Baby,"" ""Defeat You,"" and ""Diggin' Your Scene."" I highly recommend this cd for anyone that likes pop music, and bands like Sugar Ray, and Third Eye Blind!"
3,This CD is pretty Cool...,"This was a pretty cool CD. I like it alot, but something is missing from teh CD and I don't know what. Still, it has those two hit songs ""All Star"" and ""Then the Morning Comes"". I listen to it more often now, I've ahd it for a month and I still don't know the words to most of the songs. But it's still pretty good, and I think you should check it out."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"This cd is one of the worst cds ever. I got it because i liked ""all star"" and that is a good song, BUT only a few others r good. The rest of the songs, at least ten of them, have nothing memorable and nothing inventive. TRUST ME, this cd is bad and I don't recommend it! If u think it's good, u must be a die-hard fan."
4,"Despite others comments, this CD lives up to the legacy","Smash Mouth's sophmore CD wasn't as good as their first one, but this CD can save the band's reputation after the flop of their second CD. Astro Lounge is long awaited by many, if not only for the songs ""All Star"" and ""Can't Get Enough Of You Baby""."
1,Ya gotta be kidding,"This takes the cake for worst lead vocalist, along with that Matchbox 20 guy and the Green Day weirdo."
5,perfect,"this is undoubtedly 1 of the best cds ever in rock history. the only 1 ive liked better is eve6. every single song on this album rocks!!!! my favorites r i just wanna see, waste, stoned, and good morning. this is a must buy for any fan of not only smashmouth but music itself."
2,flat flat flat,"This mount is very very flat. Your lcd will be very close to the wall. You can get two extension arms from the manufacturer, but those cost about $8 each, and they are only about 3"" long, so with both of them you'll still only be about 6"" off the wall.If you're looking for a close-to-the-wall mount, this is a fine model, and it has a built-in level. Easy to install. If you want something that comes forward a bit (like to reach a nice spot on your desk from the wall) you'll want something larger."
3,Good product... A little cumbersome,"I have this mouting a TV in our kitchen. I wish it would sit more flush against the wall. Also, it's a little awkword to reach behind and turn the tilt knob. Ohther than that, I'm pretty happy with it."
2,Good re-release of two popular albums,"After much searching I finally found a seller who gave me a track list and I found out that this album is actually two albums in one, The first cd contains an album called The Beach Boys/ Jan & Dean Back to Back and the second cd contains The Beach Boys album titled Greatest Surfing Songs.It's cheaper to just buy those two albums."
1,Worst Album ever,"Richard blackwoods debut album is undoubtedly one of the worst cd's iv ever heard. Songs such as '1,2,3,4 get with the wicked' and Mama who da man are so unbelievably poor im amazed anyone agreed to release the album in the first place. Blackwoods rapping talent is non-existent throwing any word which rhymes into meaningless sentences and pasting on a cheesy beat. There has clearly been no thought put into the making of the cd as its just a quick cash in by the MTV presenter. Mr Blackwood you should be ashamed at releasing such a travesty, no one deserves to listen to this tripe."
4,My son loves this CD,"This is the fourth CD we have bought in the Reader Rabbit series. My son just loves to play with these CDs. He is very intent to conquer ""the game"" when he first gets a new CD...but with the Reader Rabbit series...he keeps coming back for more. What I like about these CDs is the child can play them at one level of understanding at first, but then go back and find new and interesting things as their learning progresses. And how could I ever forget...the golden nugget beneath it all...these CDs really teach valuable skills that help my son in school!"
2,Purple's darkest hour!,"If you're not a die-hard collector: Keep your hands off this one!! However, a respectable version of ""Wild dogs"" with the only DP-Bolin vocals available makes it up to two stars."
4,Not your typical polished blues album,"I am not a blues fanatic. I enjoy listening to it and don't really follow the specific musicians.Having said that, I enjoy listening to good traditional riffs and good blues jams, and this double CD seems to have a plenty of that. A lot of it seems free form with little rehearsal, but that's also the beauty of this CD set. I'm also not sure I could sit and listen to both CD's straight through very often, but with the great musicianship and fun listening this CD offers, it's a good listen.Enjoy."
2,Funk & Wagnalls Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music,"Unfortunately, when I received this book November 10, 2008, I found that pages 253 thru 276 were missing from the folio! With this significant exception, I was pleased with the book. Since this is a ""folio"" whose pages are loose leaf bound, I've given up trying to find a complete volume that has not been butchered in some way."
1,Very Pretty but pretty useless,"I purchased this level, and the also the 16inch version thinking I would be getting a well designed accurate tool that I would own for years. Wrong.Why? The bubble in the vials is 3/32""+ smaller than the lines in the vials. This forces me to 'eyeball' the space on both sides of the bubble and hope that the amount of space is the same. Wow, talk about 'slop' in a tool.So, 'Accuracy guaranteed for life' takes on a new meaning when the 'accuracy' is + or - 3/32 inch in every 32 inches of surface being leveled.I have a 12inch level from a well known manufacturer available in most stores and it has a bubbles that are the same size as the space between the lines in the vial making it accurate and dependable. I think I will stick with the cheaper brand and leave these toys for the kids who like shiny stuff and bright colors."
4,very enjoyable movie - happy endings on several levels,"I have watched this many times, as I could catch it on the tube, so I finally bought the DVD.I love that the daughter and mother reconnect, resolving the long term anger the daughter had, not understanding the Mom. The reuniting of old sweethearts - great too. And then she saves the boy! Can't get more good feelings out of one movie.It is similar in smoe ways to Always & Forever,sweet-hearts reunited by fate, ..which I can't find a DVD of...but if you enjoy this, movie then you will enjoy the other."
5,Bonnet Lends His Voice To The Mature Side Of Rock,"Graham Bonnet lends his voice to the mature side of Rock, reminiscent of his days with MSG, Rainbow and Alcatraz. I'm writing this review after a single spin of this remarkable CD. A dominant example of Bonnet the grand underrated vocal legend of Rock. This CD is a must for the definitive Rock Collection."
1,Worst Flight sims ever....except LOMAC,"The whole IL-2 series are some of the worst flight sims ever made....The main thing you buy a combat FLIGHT sim is for the flight..the flight modeling in this game ,I do mean game because it is far from a sim,is based on one mans ultimate approval...Olig Maddox so the flight and damage modeling is based on what he likes not real life.So if you want to fly around in an aircraft that feels as if the CG is waaaay to far aft this is your game but,if you are looking for something that replicates a real aircraft....look elsewhere. I bought all of mine to play with some friends but decided not to continue with this and now use the games as coffee coasters on my end-tables. not worth any amount of money."
5,Stabila Jammer levels,This Jammer set is great. The magnets are strong and are spaced out so that they stick to the hinges on wooden frames. Level is just the right length to fit the entire jam so you can tell if it is straight or not. My only complaint is the same with all stablila levels and that is the bubble needs to be bigger so that it completely fills the lines.
3,Works for house flies,I purchased this item to replace a different Stinger bug catcher that broke. This product works okay in small spaces to catch flies. We had a water leak and the flies started invading our bathroom. We shut off the lights and closed the door and it caught quite a few flies. I also put out a cup with a fly catching mixture and cling wrap over the top w/ a few holes. That cup caught more flies than the Stinger insect trap. (=
1,Stinger Insect Mosquito Indoor Trap doesn't work for mosquitoes.,"I recently tried this. Ran it continuously for a week. It didn't catch a single insect. In fact, I saw a mosquito hovering near it without any affect. I don't think the light is effective for mosquitoes.My recommendation -go with a Deet spray for daytime and a mosquito net for bed. Mosquito Coils are also quite effective as a repellant - if you can't stand the mild odor."
5,Definitely works if used as directed,This product definitely works if used as directed. It must be in place where it is the only main light source. I put it in the darkened bedroom during the day and move it to the den or kitchen when I go to bed and it works like a charm. I am entering this review as I order a second one to cover 2 bedrooms and both kitchen and den. The only thing that would make it better is if it interrogated the beasts to learn how they are getting into the house.
1,Nice..but,"I didn't notice any difference in the bugs, when using this device. Mayb in another environment... Still using it, but would recommend something else"
4,Like the results,"A good product that works as advertised. We put in juvenile chicken room to cut down on the fly and mosquito problem. The trap filled up with insects on the first night, but remember all the lights have to be out. The only draw back is in the emptying. You must remove the trap and take it outside because some of the trapped insects will still be alive and you don't want to release them back into the space you just caught them in."
2,Not Very Effective,"Save your money. It may work for other flying insects but it does not attract or trap gnats. After one week of dealing with a gnat infestation, the Stinger trap caught one small fly compared to 7 gnats stuck on a 3 X 10"" strip of sticky plastic film placed on a window and well over a dozen gnats drowned in a small covered plastic container of vinegar with holes in the lid."
2,Mislead,"The Stinger does work but it is advertised as quiet, I agree it is not eccessively noisy but it is not what I consider quiet. Secondly I twice emailed the manufacturer and never received a reply. My third comment is I sat at my counter about 15 feet away from the Stinger, a mosquito landed on me but was not attracted to the Stinger. I am disappointed in its performance."
3,Good for Learning,I got this book for a class. I reads OK. Pretty informative. I don't think it is something that I would get other then for a class.
5,An intriguing multi-faceted story,"Fans of mystery writing and gardening will find themselves delighted by this story of herbalist-sleuth China Bayles in yet another story of her evolving life. China has settled down and opened her herb shop - but there are ten puzzling cases here for her to solve, along with herbal advice and recipes. Unthymely Death is an intriguing multi-faceted story."
1,All 4 Blu-Ray Discs Defective,All 4 of the discs in this set wouldn't play at all. Couldn't get to a menu screen or anything. The blu-ray player tried to read them and just ejected them after about 30 seconds.
4,Not bad,"I was just looking for a quick breakfast. I love Balance Bars but they are made with High Fructose Corn Syrup. I wanted something a little healthier. These cookies are not bad. I bought this flavor since they got the best reviews. Definitely something I would order again. Some people may not like the texture. But if you are used to eating any type of protein bars, you will like these. They beat the flavor of most of those."
1,Not a big hit in my house,"I wouldn't buy these again. I thought it would be a good way to get my choco-holic small children to eat something good and quick in the morning. But they hated them, and my husband said that they bothered his stomach, causing lots of gas and discomfort. I gave it the one star only because my husband thought the taste was pretty good."
4,Taste pretty good without the transfat.,"This cookie is alright, but I find it hard to eat all at once. Too much fiber? Maybe, it's better that I can't eat it all at once because it has 300 calories, so if I eat a little at a time, I won't need to eat as much. It does taste like chocolate, so that's good. I would purchase this product, again. Great for on the go!"
4,"These are good, not great, but good","These taste pretty good for something that has that much fiber in it. I wish they were a little bigger or were more satisfying because if I eat one at 7:30, I'm starving by 11 but I don't eat lunch until 12. Very convenient though."
3,A good car seat except for...,"I will quote from a previous review ""The belts were next to impossible to really tighten - the seat was always sliding a little. Also, the straps were always getting twisted""other than this the seat is fine."
1,GRACO should RECALL this one,"my husband and i loved this seat. we are very concerned with safety, and we read all the consumer reports reviews. we are coming from a britax roundabout, which we love, but our son is getting too big for it. anyway, there were no reviews of this seat (yet), but since other graco products rate high, we decided to buy it! big mistake! everything is great about it, EXCEPT the 5-point harness straps cannot be tightened! they are so loose that you can pull them 3 inches from his chest!!! we tried everything! we ""jiggled"" the seat while tightening, we tried varying angles while pulling the strap, and my husband is very strong, and he couoldn't get them as tight as they need to be!!! we took it back - the asst manager didn't seem concerned! but that harness should be SNUG, not totally loose like it was!!! Graco should recall this seat."
5,"An Old Gem, but Still a Gem","I bought this hardback book at a garage sale and I am amazed that it turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read. It's the story of a woman who bicycles her way into a Nazi concentration camp, is saved from death by some Quaker ambulance volunteers and is eventually plunged into a bizarre situation in an isolated Native American village in New Mexico.What makes De Hartog's writing especially interesting is his ability to dig deep into the psyche of this woman, who suffered an unbearable trauma but keeps going using mental tricks that we can recognize in our own lives or in people who come our way.In addition, every time you think you have this woman or the story line figured out, the plot goes off in a direction you never expected, not at all typical of novels published in 1979.It seems ironic that Amazon is selling this book for one cent when it is so much better than most novels you come across... talk about a bargain!John J. Pint"
5,The master is back.,Another tour de force to be reckoned with. A first rate thriller by the author of The Eagle Has Landed.
1,Easy Money for Big Jack,"The Keys of Hell was originally published in the 60s when Jack Higgins seemed to pump out the thrillers by the truckload under 14 different psuedonymns. According to the preamble at the start of this new edition, the publishers felt it was too good a story to languish out of print, so here it is, freshened up and available in the new millenium... There's almost nothing to like about this book. I give it half a star because Sean Dillon isn't in it and another half star for a vaguely exciting ending."
1,know what your getting,"i just got this dvd and when i went to watch it i was confused... i didn't see MaDonna Grimes or high energy dance moves, instead there was another woman belly dancing. this is NOT what i wanted and will be returned IMMEDIATELY."
4,Dance Fitness CD,I really enjoy this workout and it is a workout. Because I can do it in my own living room I don't have to do the things I am not able to. But I'm sweating by the end and I know I've gotten a lot of good from it.
1,Oops. Wrong video.,The box and the burned image on the DVD were correct. The actual video was a belly-dancing video so I have no idea if it's a good workout.
2,Oh My Gosh!,"OK, I only made about 5 minutes of this ""easy"" dance dvd and I haven't been brave enough to try it again. I'm sure I will before winter is over, but man I was horrible and it was way beyond my ability when I first attempted it. I must admit I have very little experience with dance, however, which is why I wanted one for beginners. This seemed way harder than beginner level."
3,not bad,this dvd is too fast for begginers. It takes a little while to get the hang of it. Once you do it is fun.
2,jess,Far from what i thought it i would be getting! dont think it explains very well what the video is..
2,For BEGINNERS?????,"I think the words ""for beginners"" does not apply to this tape. However, I'm willing to admit, I'm a bit awkward and lack rhythm - soooo, it may just be me! Cheryl Metz"
1,Two Left Feet???,"I bought this workout DVD hoping it would truly be for beginners. I was sadly mistaken because evidently you need to know how to do the Salsa, Samba & Mambo before participating in this workout. I was very disappointed with MaDonna Grimes indicating this was for beginners. I love her energy, but I like a workout where the instructor explains the moves much more slowly. I've watched her on Fit TV, along with other instructors, but this workout wasn't for me as a newbie.Auntiec in Wisconsin"
2,Not a workout video,"This video is much more like a dance class than a workout. And the instructor doesn't really give much detail on how to do the steps...she just starts doing them. There's a warm up segment, a ""workout"", and then a cool down (three separate segments on the disc, with pauses). In the ""workout"", there are a lot of stops and starts...much like learning a dance in a dance class. It doesn't flow at all for a workout. And there are times when the cast messes up and they all sit there and laugh. I thought that was interuptive and very unprofessional. This might be an okay choice if you want to learn a few little mamba and salsa moves (they are all mixed together, so it's not good for learning a particular style of dance), but don't buy it if you're looking for a workout video."
2,Too Easy,"I've been dancing salsa and merengue almost all my life, so this is not challenging enough for me. To add, it is only a 15 minute workout! I like to break up a sweat, and this DVD doesn't do that for me. I recommend Samba Raggae, it is a lot better of a workout and far more challenging."
2,Wow!,"I feel this video is not for beginners. They all looked like professional dancers. I kind of gave up after a while out OF frustration. I think I will stick with Denise Austin DVD's, they seem to be easier to follow, but kind of boring. The makers of this video should consider that there could be older, less in shape people out there who need to go a little slower. Sorry, just my opinion.Judy"
2,Not treat,OK dvd but not what I was expecting. There needs to be more instruction for people like me who are new to this type workout.
3,Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes: African Beat - Latin...,Okay! These routines are a little too easy and not much to get the heart rate up as needed. Blah!
5,If you have a PS3 and a teenager...,"I have two PS3s and a teenager so buying this magazine was a no-brainer. I've been a subscriber since the old days (i.e. PS1). If you're a parent, you may notice that young people these days don't read too much. My son reads magazines recreationally. With PS3 games at $60 each, this is a good investment to see what might intrest you. BTW: I hate everything made by Ubisoft or Unreal. (Sorry for the mini rant.)"
3,Interesting!,"Ok, I'm not very smart and not a scientist but I really like these recordings cause to me they remind me of childhood, really, the ""cosmic"" sounds sound like, ""I know that sound""...oops the advert said that! Anyway volume 1 is ok so I prefer the other volumes and planets cause they sound ""jazzer""! I think Neptune and Saturn are really ""hot"" planets and have a nice song! I love this stuff! Be careful because these cause a lot of money now! Ok? Buy!"
3,Entertainment,"This is a decent ""japanimation"" type flick if you are into that sort of thing. The story is entertaining and the voice acting is acceptable. Graphically it is well done as most films of this type tend to be. I find it a bit difficult to review as I personally don't often watch this type of movie."
3,Average,"I'm not an anime fan. But I gave 'Vexille' a shot as it was not traditional anime as it was fully rendered CGI style. While some of the visuals were pretty nice, this film did not change my view on anime. There's some great looking stuff going on, the music isn't bad, but the story/plot is absolutely incomprehensible.'Vexille' is a pretty decent visual treat, but if you are looking for some substance, then skip this one."
2,"Appleseed, is that you??","If you are interested in seeing Vexille... just go watch Appleseed. Essentially the same story minus the romantic interest. The plot is thin, character development poor, pacing is horrible and the story is very similar to Appleseed's (in more than just a ""It's anime it's all similar"" sort of way). Not worth buying."
3,"Ultra-Real, Hyper-Paranoid assault on the Visual Cortex","There are scenes, images and sequences in this film that will simply astound you. And this holds true for the whole gamut ranging from complex chase and battle scenes to scenes as simple as a dimly lit room. The film has a great command of a visual langauge that will evoke mood and feeling. This alone is worth giving it a look.But it does have some weak points. The basic story is about a band of rebels that need to stop an evil corporation from hatching its plan to eradicate humans and take over the world. Pretty much the whole story right there. So it is a bit thin on both plot and story.Worth watching because it is almost a tour-de-force of visual imagination but, and as ironic as it sounds, even though there is a whole lot of action, not a whole lot seems to happen because the story and plot are so thin."
2,Wireless Security,I bought these for home security but they do not work very well. I'm not as pleased as I thought I would be. From the monitor you can hardly see the image.
4,One of the classics,"If you like the usual whirl with Perry, Della, and Paul, then this is one of the early-1950's classics. Great period feel and just the right touch of LA 50's sleaze to remind you of the grit that the best ESG work can have."
5,Perry Mason : The Case of The One Eyed Witness,"I don't know yet,I can't get its down,into to my Wi\Fi Kindel ,I got to buy a new cordless Moden ,be for itts will down load its, Thank you"
4,The horse and Buggy people II,"This had some really great recipes in it! very nice book and I would buy it again! They were home style recipes, and most of the idems you would have on your shelves already, don't have to go to the store for the idems!"
1,Not worth it!,It lures some bugs but we also used it without and got just a few less. So I do not recommend this.
1,must be old,we have owned our stinger for 2 years-this is the time we had refils that were not effective.
4,Really works!,This car actually does go after you shake it. Only issue is my 2.5 year old son still doesn't really have the hang of it and didn't seem as interested in it as I thought he would.
1,"Quick, but depressing read","This book is a rigidly light-hearted portrayal of a woman, Caroline, trying to figure out what she should be doing. Married to an academic, and dissatisfied with being a housewife she attempts to fill her time by reading to residents at a retirement home. Her husband becomes very interested in the individual that Caroline is reading to, and steals a manuscript to further his research.The cynical disrespect and disregard that Caroline, her husband, and all the characters exhibit for ethics or pretense of social feeling is no doubt intended to amuse. Since her best friend is a hedgehog-fancier one cannot help but imagine that this is supposed to be a comedic story. Perhaps it is the distance in time (the book was published posthumously in 1986), but rather than humorous the characters are repellent, the plot depressing, the racism irritating. This is the type of book that might be interesting when published, but is quickly outmoded."
5,Classic Zombie Action!!!!,"I remember seeing this film, on VHS, for the first time in the 80s. I rented it from a mobile video rental van one Saturday and watched it with a friend of the family. It was scratchy 4:3, as you would expect, but in the time which preceded the stupid VIDEO NASTY campaign in the UK, it was totally uncut.My friend had never seen anything like it! And so, despite living two counties away from us, he came back the next weekend and watched it again!Then it disappeared from the UK shelves, only to-appear in butchered form - thankfully only for a short while - and then uncut (finally) but in non-anamorphic letterbox presentation.And now, finally and after years of wishing and waiting...it arrives in full uncut, full 1080p richness. Unless the studio does some pretty spectacular jiggery-pokery with the original remaining elements I cannot really see this looking any better for some considerable time.Good film and possibly the very best of the Italian Zombie Movies."
1,Bad... JUST BAD,"While every horror dog needs its day and I am loving that a lot of classics are getting restored, this film is just BAD. I am a first-time viewer of it, and the dialogue is laughable, the dubbing horrendous, the effects ham-handed and cheesy and it's very hard to feel bad for any of the confoundingly-stupid characters. Don't get me wrong, I am a Dario Argento fan. I love corny dubbed Giallo films. This one was no good mainly because the island setting sucked. I'm gald fans of this film are getting a good version, but other than that... ugh. I am new to Lucio Fulci. This is my second after ""The House By The Cemetery"" which I found an absolute HOOT."
3,A disappointment after a good start,"After having read all of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series to date, I saw way too many parallels in here for my tastes. This might be the weakest of the four books of the series that I have read. Still Goodkind is a solid writer that keeps things moving along, and the main characters are enjoyable."
1,URRGHHHH!!!!,"I have read book number one in the series and I was very annoyed by all the perverted sex stuff in it (I have reviewed it too). I decided not to continue reading book number two, but I opened the book somewhere in the middle just to get an impression of how the book was. [...] He writes good and his books are exiting when they are meant to be, but I couldn't make myself read this book. It was almost a whole chapter just containing a woman (can't remember her name) torturing Richard (and it isn't just lashes of a whip!!!) at the same time as she loves him. That's just so [...] typical isn't it??People might say that i judge the book too early since I've just read five pages, but I don't think that Goodkind has changed his sex-and-young-boys fixed thinking. I think it's VERY strange that people have almost not reacted on this before."
1,Even worse than the first one,"My oh my. This book is a complete waste of time and money. Even writing this review feels like that. WFR was not good, but SOT is really bad. I expected Goodkind to become better after his first novel, but was disappointed. I'm so sorry that I purchased all 4 Volumes of the series at once. Those of you who think that Jordan's Wheel of Time is a masterpiece will like it though. But let me tell you: Wheel of Time is not a masterpiece - not even a good book."
1,Kindle Version Review,"Do not misunderstand my review of this novel. I love the book. The kindle version is another story. The conversion to ebook is filled with very distracting spelling errors and word conversions. The most noticeable being ""than"" is almost always translated as ""that"", ""of"" and ""if"", and many others. It may sound trivial, but it is very distracting as a reader to have to reread sentences and paragraphs to decipher the true meaning."
4,Bad editing,"In general, I found this book to be entertaining. I've only read the first two books in this series and I would describe them as entertaining if not necessarily the best written.The real reason I wanted to write this review was to let Amazon know that the editing of the Kindle edition is horrible. Paragraphs are not indented (making dialogue difficult to follow in some instances), the word ""than"" is replaced by ""that"" (and vice versa) constantly, and there are loads upon loads of other small editorial mistakes. A few mistakes wouldn't be a big deal but they seemed endless. Amazon should really have this book re-edited."
5,"The intense, heroic adventure continues!!","After reading the First book in few days, I knew I would be entranced by his sequel. I could never put the book down. There is never a low point in the book. If you plan on getting some sleep than don't read this becuase you are never going to stop reading it until you have it finished."
2,Mr. Goodkind needs an editor,"Everyone knows the Wizards First Rule. This is MY first rule: Mr. Goodkind couldn't write a graceful, believable line of dialogue to save his soul from Darken Rahl. This is my second rule: Mr. Goodkind's editor is either so incompetent that he/she should be hung from the highest rafter of the Palace of the Prophet OR he/she has been collared and tortured to the extent he/she can no longer performed his/her duties. (Hasn't Mr. Goodkind ever learned to HINT?) Finally, my third rule: every character in this book is too stupid to escape the Keeper."
3,Stone of Tears,"The story is OK, a bit drawn out and over dramatic at certain points. The story is overly descriptive, treating the reader as if they are 12 but the book is written for adults, supposedly. My worst problem with this Kindle version is wading through and reinterpreting the numerous spelling and grammatical errors.I will try the next book in the series but if the story angle doesn't change away from lots of fighting, I probably won't continue on with the series since it is a bit predictable."
3,Typo City,"This book was good, but not as good as the first in the series. However this review is not about the content of the book. I got the Kindle version and it was riddled with typos. It's very distracting to read a book that has so many mistakes in it. I'm sure the author would not be pleased with the way his creation is being distributed."
3,Doesn't do justice to the series,I love this series. I simply couldn't get into the portions of the book involving Kahlan or the Sisters. I found the story much more appealing when Richard showed up. This simply was not a book in the series I can read over and over. It did not live up to Wizard's First Rule.
3,Getting better,"I didn't really like the first volume of this series, and vol. 2 ain't a masterpiece either, but I would regard it as a better than average read anyway. Even if the plot seemed to drag a little bit at first, it sped up towards the end and the last 200 pages or so were very entertaining, especially the parts about Richard in the Palace. Another good thing was the lack of overly detailed torture scenes that partially spoiled the first book.Faults? There's a little too many ideas copied straight from Jordan. And if the 3rd volume contains an even more epic plotline... well, I just hope it won't. Still, could have been worse."
1,Good Place to End the Series,"If you are looking for a way to kill a few days reading an below par book then this is the one to get. This author does his best to drag out a book that should be no long than 400-500 pages into one almost 1000. He does so by repeating lines of characters over and over, adding in openings for future books, and constantly describing Richard and Kahlan's feelings for each other.These books have the weakest plot line I have ever seen and left me with a bad taste in my mouth for wasting the 12hrs it took to read. The author seemed to focus more on side plots in order for him to write even more crappy books than on actually getting to the point and finishing this one.Dont read these books. Instead look into George R.R. Martin."
1,Oh my God!,"The only thing worst than reading Stone of Tears is reading these reviews! Someone actually reviewed this book as ""long but worthwhile!"" Great! Terry Goodkind fans are people with the attention span of gnats who need D'Haran soldiers cutting open small boys and raping their livers to keep their attention for more than three pages! Terry Goodkind should be the public relations advisor to Saddam Hussein.Oh! The characters... Big handsome good guy! Cute little good girl! Perverted, sinister bad guys! Terry makes Dr. Seuss look like deep reading. Actually, I don't think most Goodkind fans could get through an entire book by Dr. Seuss without wandering off and raping their sisters or something."
2,THIS IS NOT NEW! IT'S DAMAGED!,"I ordered a book that was labeled new. I paid full price for this book plus shipping and handling. When I received the book I noticed a black ink blemish stamped on the outside of the pages at the top of the book. However, the book is otherwise in good condition. I'm very disappointed I paid full price for a book with an ink blemish on the outside pages at the top of my book."
1,Disappointment,"If I could have got by with giving this book a rating below one star, I would have. The book isn't worth the time of day. It is drivel...and actually, if I could have got by with a one word review, I would have written ""drivel"" and nothing more. I'd really like my $8+ back."
3,"Good Customer Service, Bad Item","Item sent was listed as ""Good"" condition when the item ordered was ""Very Good"" condition. Customer service was fast and provided a partial credit. Would consider ordering from again."
5,Sword of Truth Series - GREAT!!,"This is a very long series - 12 books I think, But I can't put them down. I'm on the 4th one now and still going - Each one builds on the last but some things are finish and some carry over. Be prepared for the long haul - each book is 600-800 pages - but absolutely worth the effort ."
4,can you hire new editors,A great story almost undone by the terrible editing. Having read the print edition; the e book version was riddled by grammatical errors that did not occur in the original.
3,"Ugh...typos, deletions","Excellent follow up to Wizard's First Rule. However, most of my reading was done on my iPhone kindle app and the text was plagued with missing text between page breaks, typos, and grammatical errors. Not sure if this was a problem w the app or a problem with the kindle edition of the book. Either way, was hella frustrating!"
4,Definately worth a look.,"While not as completely engrossing as the first book in the series, Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind still does an excellent job with The Stone of Tears. The sequel brings again to the epic saga of Kahlan and Richard, who really ought to have sorted themselves out by now. Now we have Richard being captured by the mysterious Sisters of the Light so they can teach him to use his gift (magic). Goodkind gives the reader hints of Richard's past along with seductive hints about the Wizard's War that ravaged the land centuries before. This book is not the generic, money-making sequel that some authors rattle out by the thousand by taking some insignificant character from their first book and shoving them into the main plot line kicking and screaming. It answers questions from the previous novel and leaves the reader asking more. Definately worth a look."
5,Well written! A wonderful sequel to the first book.,"I didn't know exactly what to expect when I first bought this book. I wasn't sure Terry would keep weaving a wonderful story, but he did. At the end, it seems sort of well unrealistic that Richard could make it back in what?, 2 days. But I knew that Kahlan wouldn't be dead. It was sort of predictable, but I had a feeling that things would work out and Richard could forgive Kahlan if he knew why she made him put the collar on. I can't wait to read Blood of the Fold."
1,The Innocent Man:Murder and Injustice in a Small Town,"I am a big Grisham fan and have read every book he has written. This one was a huge dissapointment. It almost appears that Grisham first started to research this character in order to write a similar type fiction novel he is so famous for, then changed his mind and submitted his notes for publication. It was a ""60 Minutes"" type report that certainly didn't help to advance his writing career. It's been a long time since his last novel, his fans were anticipating another fine fictional thriller, and Grisham failed to deliver. Why does success lead people to think they can forget ""who brought them to the dance?"""
2,Waste of time,"Grisham is definitely not Truman Capote, Capote even made us feel sorry for the killers. The ""innocent man"" was just a shallow creep. I found this book extremely boring and will definitely read customer reviews before buying any more Grisham books. I have always loved his fiction he should stick to what he knows."
4,Tough to Take,"Sometimes, after reading a book like this, you wonder who the real criminals are. Are they the ones inside the jails, or are they sitting next to us on the bus, subway, perhaps driving in the car in the lane beside you? Or, are they the people who we pay to maintain justice in our nation?Reading these well written chapters, you wonder out loud: how often does this happen? Is the Ron Williamson story a unique case? You'd like to believe that. But Grisham seems to hint that thinking that way is wishful at best. In this day and age of technology, our moral fiber is seriously wanting, and the author deserves credit for exposing it to the masses"
4,well-written,John Grisham's departure from fiction was a successful one. He continued his tradition of providing the reader with a suspenseful story containing insight into the criminal justice system.
4,Shocking & Awakening,"This was an eye opening & shocking story. Some of the timeline of the subjects' lives was a bit tedious & hard to get through, but their story is important to know. The book was, in the end, a satisfying read; however disappointing at how some things & people turned out."
4,Good read but was a little hard to get into.,"This was a pretty good book,but I was finding it hard to finish at times."
1,"John, Please Write Only ""Fiction"" From Now On","John Grisham has been one of my favorite authors for many years. I've read and enjoyed his ""legal thrillers"" as well as his other efforts such as ""Bleachers"" and ""The Painted House"". ""The Innocent Man"" is, I believe, his first effort at writing non-fiction.Based on this effort, Mr. Grisham should return to fiction and leave non-fiction to others. Most, if not all, of Grisham's books are a pleasure to read. They fall into the ""can't put down"" category. This book on the other hand has been difficult to slog through; I've been attempting to finish it for a couple of weeks.As I read the book, I was struck by the seeming incompetence of the law enforcement officials, and their zeal to get convictions in spite of what appeared to be inadequate evidence. After doing a little poking around on the internet, I think I've discovered why. [...]"
4,Wow!,"Even though I have been a long-time fan of Grisham's fiction, even I was stunned by how amazing his first non-fiction book was. The title does not do justice to the story--it is much more interesting than it sounds.As usual, the author paints vivid, fully fleshed-out characters. What's really neat is that these are actual people, most of whom he hasn't met. He wrote this story based on extensive research of case files, and yet he depicts these people as if he's intimately acquainted with them.There are so many people who I wish would read this book--health care professionals, judges, public defenders and prosecutors. Upon reading this I think you'll see why.Bravo, Mr. Grisham!!!"
3,Small Town Justice,"A story of what happens when small town law enforcement cannot solve a crime with hard work, talent and brains. The result is grasping at the first feasible motive and suspect rather than admit they can't solve the crime.This book was especially interesting to me as I grew up less than 30 miles from the town where the events in this book took place. I enjoyed reading about many of the places that I have visited. As most non-fiction, this book is often tedious in explaining the background and surroundings for the major characters. The ending is particularly disappointing as none of the major knuckleheads responsible for the fiasco ever really get what they deserve."
3,Not your typical John Grisham read,"I purchased this book without knowing that it was a non-fiction book and without knowing what the contents was. To me, it was a John Grisham book that I hadn't read yet. It didn't take me long to realize that this was a real case because I felt like I was reading a documentary that was pieced together without much of a smooth flow. The story contents in itself about Ron Williamson and the police/justice system was very insightful but it was not one of the better books of his that I have read. I'd recommend the book to anybody who likes reading true crime novels but if looking for an exciting novel with twists and turns, this is not the book for you. I do have to commend Mr. Grisham though for bringing into light the seriously fatal flaws in our so called Justice system."
2,Disappointment,"Grisham should stick to fiction. He seems to have well vetted his recitation of the facts in the case, and it brings attention to innocent people which are no doubt behind prison bars. However, many writers could have recited the facts of the cases with some background thrown in the mix, but duties or causes such as these could be done just as well by any number of writers. Grisham's talents are best used in the area of fiction, spinning fascinating yarns on real issues facing the law and lawyers with the latitude given him in the fiction arena.I pre-purchased ""The Appeal"" , and chose to include ""The Innocent Man"" in the same transaction. I am only on the second CD of his new novel and he has already reminded me why he is among the most entertaining writers today.(Both of these audio books were listened to in the unabridged version, the only audio version that deserves consideration. Listening to an abridged book is not fair to you or the author.)"
4,Wrongly Convicted,"I have heard many times about people being wrongly convicted, but I have never followed a story like this one. I have to admit, this book was very interesting to me, I assume because it was a true story. I am not much of a non fiction fan, however, this book was given to me as a present. I am glad that I read it and was astonished at how one city could have so many wrongly convicted people. Without ruining the outcome of this book for anyone, I strongly suggest that if you love non fiction books, then, you will love this one."
1,"I agree, it's boring!","Put it down after 100 pages - life is too short to waste time on this! Long, detailed descriptions of the lives of the protagonists - no action or intrigue, or, really, anything thought-provoking."
1,What was he thinking?,"What happened to the great suspense filled writing that we have seen in all of his past books? I was very disappointed with this book. I struggled to get through it, it was very repetitive and it gave you alot of fact about the case, but it was too cut and dry like a news report! It was not his usual writing! Too bad for us John Grisham fans!!!"
2,Stick to fiction,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham, but this book is a dud! The story is fascinating and needs to be told, but by someone else. While Grisham seems to get the facts and the chronology of events across, the read is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Stick to fiction John."
4,Not bad at all...,"OK - ""The Innocent Man"" is not your regular John Grisham (JG) lawyers' book - this is a non-fiction book, therefore the atmosphere is different (at least to me).Not the usual legal mumbo jumbo lingo (still some)... but as you go along with the story, each chapter reviews what's happening to Ron (the main character) and the ""imperfect"" of our legal system. Either JG really hates the LEO/prosecutor/lawyers/judge in the city of Ada, or the LEO/prosecutor/etc really did screw up and an innocent man was sent to jail for over 10 years and sentenced to death.After reading the book, I did a Google search and found more information on the story. Interesting material."
2,disappointed Grisham fan,"I hope that this is the last non-fiction book that John Grisham writes. I have not read a book of his that I didn't like until this one.It reads like a bad episode of Dateline NBC. It's hard to keep up with all of the people involved. AND I don't know if I can emphasize this point enough, IT IS EXTREMELY DEPRESSING. Stories like this about fictional characters can be enjoyable at times b/c they are seperated from reality, but when it happens to real people it just makes you sick.Brief synopsis:A woman is murdered.A man's life begins to fall apart.A man's life continues to fall apart.Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does.There's no nice neat bow on the end of this one. There are no answers. There is no final resolution.Pass."
3,Too Far Fetched for Fiction?,"My first ""true crime"" book. And wow. I am really shocked that something like this can happen...that people this obviously innocent can be committed and even placed on death row. I suppose I'm a bit naive to the system but I'd like to believe that justice is better served.If this was a fiction book, I'd have never believed this story.I think I'll definitely try some more true crime books. This wasn't the most supremely written book I've ever seen, but it was good. It read well though the names got a bit confusing as there were a lot given without much ""characterization"" except for the main characters. I think it was an interesting subject, but it could have been presented a bit more clearly."
2,Too long but good storyline,"The summary of the book and the author drove me to purchase this book. I got through half the book and stopped, even though I felt guilty for not finished a book, because I have other books on my shelf that I want to read. The storyline is good but it is way too long and very repetitive. The book could have been shortened by at least 1/2 and still have a powerful story. Good storyline but it drags on and on that it gets lost to the reader."
1,Grisham should stick to fiction,Terribly boring. all you had to do is read the jacket of the the book. The book just dragged on and on. I had to stop reading it 3/4 the way through. I have read all of his other books and really enjoyed them. This one was a bomb
