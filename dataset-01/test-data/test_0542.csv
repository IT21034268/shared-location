4,An interesting storyline!,"I liked the plot and the story. Could have used a good editor, but it was a story I enjoyed."
3,not very mathematical,"i can see that mr. huntley really thinks mathematics are beutiful (and i agree), but he fails to make a convincing argument of that fact. the math in the book is very basic, he just repeats what you'll find in any other golden ratio book and his aesthetics and psychology theories are far out and not properly argumented. i much preferred mario livio's book on the subject."
2,Okay content; irritating style,"The ""divine proportion"" is the positive solution of x^2 = x+1. Many of its 'amazing' properties follow from this definition; substitute x=(divine proportion) into any polynomial and it'll reduce to number+number*(divine proportion). Anyway, the author is _constantly_ exclaiming how amazing and beautiful and awe-inspiring his subject is. I like an author to be enthusiastic, but when I bought this book I was tempted to staple together the groups of pages that go on and on about this, quoting sonnets, etc, so I could find the math more easily."
5,The Huxtables in your own home!,"Now you can have the Huxtable family in your home 366/24/7 with this beauty. Or in your office. It comes complete with the history of NBC's Emmy-winning THE COSBY SHOW and a solo photo of series star,comedian Bill Cosby. I'd love to have this hanging on my bedroom wall. The cast photo is circa 1984 when TCS premiered. Surrounding Cosby are his five original castmates Phylicia Ayers Allen(as she was then billed),Lisa Bonet,Malcolm Jamal Warner,Tempest Bledsoe and Keshia Knight Pulliam. This is an excellent piece of TCS memorabilia and is a suggestive keepsake for all TCS fans."
5,stark contrast,"My 3 month old rescue pup sniffed, and eventually ate, 6 different dog treats with indifference. When I tried Yummy Chummies, he tried to claw them out of my hand! I could hardly believe it! He'll eat most anything now (3 yr later), but there is still a difference; he loves fish."
2,Something Has Changed!!!,"When I first starting buying these treats - they were great. They were soft and chewable. The last three bags of these treats that I have purchased (2 on Amazon - 1 pet store), I have returned 2 of them. The treats were really hard and dried out. It seems like it takes my dog a long time to digest them and her breath smells terrible as long as their in her stomach. Yuck. I don't know what has changed but the product sure has changed."
1,chummies no longer yummy,"My dog used to love these, and ate them for years. I ordered 2 bags for the pet sitter to feed her while I have been away but she noticed my dog refused to eat any. When she checked the ingredient label she saw they are no longer pure salmon but are now using fillers! I would send this food back but the return window will close while I am not home."
2,Hated by my dogs,"My three dogs HATED this product. They will eat all the other stuff I'll give them, except this. I don't know what it is about it, but they really dislike it. Make sure you try it on your dog first before purchasing the 2.5lbs bag."
5,My picky eater loved these!,"My dog, who has been known to snub an average dog biscuit, loved these! Nice to know they're good for him too. I think the Amazon price is a little high though -- I noticed you can get them from PetCo in the store for cheaper, although they only carry the original flavor."
1,like impotence on your wedding night....,"man....what a disappointment. i have been a true phan...55 shows in 8 years...and i know what these guys can do. this isn't it. yeah yeah. i know...only four days of rehersal and this is what they came up with. well - some things are better kept to ourselves. there are a few decent songs, but to talk about the phab phour using words like ""decent"" and ""pretty good"" is just not right. after seeing the slop they threw together on SNL .....All in all. Excrement."
2,Hack Job,"Phish should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this sloppy thing on their rabid fans, who are ready and willing to ingest anything they get following the cult band's 2-year hiatus. Phish reportedly spent two weeks writing and recording this album; all I can say is, they should have spent four - at least then they'd be able to drop some of the tedious odes to tequila and random jamming that make this disc a yawn. One has to admire their confidence in assuming they could crank out something good and get going right away, but there are times even a revered jam band ought to pause and consider that their poor fans need some quality to hang their hats on, especially from a studio release when the band could have taken a bit more care if they felt like it. Sounds like they didn't."
1,No discussion...the worst phish album ever,"I know everyone would LOVE to love this album, but wake the F up. P & M, Seven Below, and Waves are the only tracks even worth listening to. Not that they're even that great. They just arent awful. phish should be embarrassed by this album. You know all those ""OK"" Phish albums? this makes any one of those shine with brilliance. There is absolutely NO coherence to this album. It was not concieved AT ALL, it was just thrown out like a product on a shelf. If you folks consider this a ""Good"" album, I think its time you start exploring the rest of what the world of music has to offer. How ironic is it that Phish's NYE concert has tix for sale for a 1,000 bucks right now, but they just released the worst album they ever could have to promote it? The answer to that question would be....VERY"
1,Rubble,"I am a casual Phish Phan.As such, this CD is quite tortuous to get through. Case in point-- are the weak melodies as well as the childish lyrics.I would rather catch my scrotum on a rusty nail then have to listen to this again.Look to there back catalogue for more adventureous music.Regards,HR"
2,Disappointing and sloppy,"This has got to be Phish's most ridiculous album ever released. Hopefully the members of Phish will put some of the proceeds from this album into taking voice lessons, purchasing a guitar tuner, and finding a producer to give them better guidance. It's very disappointing to see this group putting out this type of drivel when they have the capability of doing so much more . The only thing keeping this from being a 1-star review is that they at least made an attempt to create a raw-sounding record with few overdubs and a ""live"" feel, but it just comes across as sloppy and unrefined. Very poor writing throughout, aimless noodling, and bad musicianship make this album laughable. Perhaps Phish should consider a permanent hiatus."
1,Disappointing...,"As a longtime Phish fan, I am very disappointed in this album. I found the songs annoyingly similar and bland and hardly representative of live Phish as many other reviews I've read have stated. With the exception of a few moments on this disk, the sound is a wash of noodle-y guitar and uninspired vocals.If your favorite parts of Phish are the superlative musicality and creativity of Mike, Trey, Jon, and Page, then you can do better with any of their other offerings.I'm afraid even the magic of Phish's live performances will not be sufficient to improve these exceedingly mediocre songs."
2,I expected better,The person who lent me this book highly recommended it but I didn't find it very interesting or entertaining except for one story about American in-flight catalogues. Not sure what was going on otherwise.
2,Lacks Thorough Examples & Explanations,"This book was required for the DE classes at UTexas for a first/second year student, encountering DE's for the first time. The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's. However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through. The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material. For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times. In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that? In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new. Overall the examples are vague."
4,Gamma Pro Rx Replacement Grip,"The grip is reasonably easy to apply but because of the cushioning, you really have to wrap the grip evenly with a lot of tension, so that during use the grip does not loosen from the handle. My second re-grip effort resulted in a more even and longer lasting sticky grip. I've been pretty happy with it for the last 2-3 months. I have 4 rackets and I play 4 times a week."
4,"Listen up, this here is good music!!","When I first heard the catchy tune on the TV, I said self this sounds like a good song, speaking of six of one half dozen of another. All the tracks are catchy tune's but as all singers go ,alot of others got the nod and it looks as if Nichols wasen't one of the chosen one 's. But I did enjoy the CD ,and will be waiting for other songs by Joe Nichols."
3,Ok but that's all,Found this book to be ok for someone that's above a novice plumber. It doesn't cover a great deal but I picked up a couple of new things. I was looking for more!
1,growing not selling,One chapter is on selling. All other chapters are on growing fresh cut herbs. Most herb growers fail because they do not market their product intensely enough. This book does not help in that regard. Just growing it won't get it sold.
5,GOOd READ,i got this 4 my husband... its funny b/C he reads it and uses it on me... like you need to do something in here lol....
1,Not enough information,"While I don't own this book, I would never buy it online with the way you presented it. To buy a music book, you need not only to see an index of the songs included, but also a few pages out of the book (even if not from the same page if you don't want to provide too much free content)... The reason for this is music can be too easy and too difficult to play. The worst feeling in the world is getting a book you ordered online only to find it is too boring to play because the music is too easy, or too difficult to play so it just stands on the bookshelf waiting for a more proficient player. Please provide us with more, this is true of all your sheet music."
5,"Excellent, Readable Economics Text","I bought this book thinking it would be packed with Laffer curves and consumption functions and would make technical economic theories simple. It instead is one of the most layman-readable economics texts that I have read. Outstanding coverage of the areas of economics that truly matter, and those that would be deemed relevant to the non-economist. Those who enjoyed Milton Freidman's Capitalism and Freedom would find this text equally readable."
4,On The Line.,"This is a well-written book, containing a series of short stories, each filled with plenty of action. One has no idea how each will end -- until the end.Each story is interesting, and written in such a way that one does not wish to quit reading until he/she comes to the end.I recommend this book for anyone who likes western stories, or just likes exciting tales.Uzal W. Ent"
4,Stories of the Old West,"Louis L'Amour almost never failed to write a good story although the editing was sometimes subpar, which is surprising since all his work was printed on paper first, published by major publishers.At any rate, most of these stories follow the usual plot. A good guy bucks a big rancher or other powerful man or group often just out of contrariness. He usually stakes a claim, makes friends of the little guys around the area and fights off bad guys sometimes with considerable effort and pain. The story ends with the bad guy or guys dying from the good guy's well-placed bullets and him getting the girl. A standard storyline and L'Amour does it very well, with good writing, historic detail and a western flavor.I buy and read Louis L'Amour so you may consider this review somewhat bias although I have tried to be as accurate as possible. If you like westerns, you'll probably like this book. If you have never read L'Amour this is a good place to start. I can honestly recommend it."
3,no scooper or enzymes in box.,"the scooper and the enzymes did not come in the box as promised. all i received was the septic tank, which is very difficult to install. other than that, the product works."
1,Not worth it,This did not meet my expectations.I really wanted this to work and it was a disaster.Not worth it.
1,Doom isn't ment for the gameboy,"I got this game as a present for my little brother but decided to have a go myself at it, I used to play alot of doom and doom 2 on the pc but this gameboy version does nothing for the original pc version.The small screen and terrible lighting make this game almost impossible to see, by time you realize there is a bad guy in front of you its too late he already has got a few shots on you. Doom is a great game, buts its not for the gameboy, it needs to remain on a big screen, were you can see what your doing. The gameboy is a fantastic game system but something just are not compatible, in this case two positives make a negative, its a shame.1 Star"
4,DANIEL JOHNS CONQUERS HIS DEMONS,"Silverchair's current music bares no resemblance to their grunge phase. Singer Daniel Johns, has always had the rare gift to translate his personal demons into verse. Now he has the emotional maturity to explore dark themes through upbeat melodies, replacing the angsty grunge of silverchair's past. As one listens to Diorama, and perhaps Luv Your Life in particular, one gets the impression that you are listening to a man who has been to hell and that the songs on Diorama our filled with his ""dear diary"" entries detailing his resurrection. Luv Your Life captures the emotion and isolation of depression: ""and i'm all by my self"" but that this is maybe what he's most comfortable with: ""the way i wanna be"", yet also embraces the concept of rejoicing the good times. Diorama is Silverchair's most mature and ambitious album to date."
5,This is a book worth of keeping for a reliability practioner,The book provides a comprehensive knowledge on reliability analysis. I rarely see a book like this in terms of the non-parametric model analysis.
3,Dazed and confused,"One of those collectors' releases here; the mix on this CD is quite different from the domestic. Not only is there a chic packaging, but there are two completely different tracks and the order of the other tracks has been switched around. As for the music itself: It's typical FSOL, not to imply that they have a 'typical' sound, but you should be warned beforehand that like all their other CDs, this one is completely different. The sound production is excellent, of course, and it makes for a rich listening experience."
5,Great Book!,this book is great. i couldn't put it down once i started reading it. i've read it more than once. i recommend to all.
1,What kinda shape is this?!,"Maybe I misread the description, but the shape of this is not a ""U"" shape, but something more like an ""S"". I bought this for my trip to europe and it was just not working the way I had hoped. If anyone had the proper instructions on how to use it, please advise!"
4,Thinner,"The item is thinner that it appear in the website. It can be bend, so, it needs to be handled carefully. The rest is ok, it looks luxurious and elegant. Can hold the reed very strongly."
3,Sturdy but low content value,"This book is about 8 pages long. The pictures are stills from the television show. In this volume, Po has a watering can which he sprinkles on items (ball, hat, bag) to make them ""enormous."" The flaps are large enough for little hands and sturdy. The story is: Po makes the items enormous and the teletubbies love their enormous items and each other, the end. Very small kids seem to like repetitous books, and this one isn't too expensive and at least the flaps will last. While the educational content of this whole series is questionable, children really seem to love these characters."
3,100 Bible Songs,Great choice of songs - includes all of the popular songs. The kids' voices are cute too. My only complaint is that the tempo could be a little faster. My daughter seems to lose interest a little waiting for the next verse on some songs.
3,Inconsistent tunes make for a frustrating spin,"I really wanted to give this record a fourth star but I just couldn't do it. This is an extremeley frustrating listen. Jan P. Dennis correctly points out that a few of the tunes tread dangerously close to smooth jazz. I would argue that on some tunes they go beyond treading close to actually taking on smooth jazz water. It's too bad because there's some really excellent, interesting music here. That's what makes this record so frustrating. I also think they should have credited more than just ""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" to Joe Zawinul. On more than a couple of occasions I thought I had put ""Black Market"" or Sweetnighter"" in my player. ... Bottom line is that while there's some really great music here, I can't recommend it due to what I feel to be an uneven performance (especially when compared to the recent stellar releases from Dave Douglas and ScoLoHoFo)."
2,Great pictures!,"The pizza dough is delicious as is the shrimp toast, ginger-scented pecans, and the white wine punch. However, some of the ingredient amounts are way off (you end up with too much of one hard-to-use-in-another-recipe item like leeks) and preparation was much too labor intensive. For example: ""using three sizes of melon ballers, make melon balls and place them on a cookie sheet making sure none of them touch."" It can be simplified by the cook - I used one melon baller, put all the melon balls in a tray, froze them even though they were touching and everything worked fine. Good ideas, difficult execution. Beautiful pictures."
1,Martha Stewart's Hors D'ouvres Handbook,This is a beautiful book riddled with errors. It is just about impossible to cook shrimp and then devein them. Are the editors afraid to edit?
2,Beatiful but impractical,"I agree with several reviewers that Mrs. Stewart's new book is simply beautiful. But cookbooks have to be more than just beautiful, and unfortunately Mrs. Stewart's book doesn't meet my needs. A great deal of her appetizer recipes require on-the-spot or just-before-serving preparations. When I have parties, I want to prepare as much as I can in advance so that I can enjoy myself. Therefore, it is unlikely that I will get to use the recipes in this book much."
5,this is the definitive book on this subject!!!,"This is a book I've been waiting for!! My wife and I have always found that our best ""dinner"" parties are the ones were we serve a variety of finger foods rather than one big entree. This book will give us ideas for years to come!! I must say that I think the best part of the book is its lay-out. You first get to see what the foods look like and then if you want the receipe, the page number is printed next to the picture. I wish all cookbook authors would use this visual approach to their receipes. I felt the the receipes were easily within the reach of the average cook and the explanations and tips on preparation were wonderful. All in all this is a book I will not only treasure but I will use again and again!!!!!"
5,A real wowser,"This book's organized into 2 sections, the first is photos, the second the recipes -- with a ribbon bookmark for each. The photos are fabulous, and the recipes aren't bad, either. Some ingredients may be hard to find outside major metropolitan areas, but the book includes a source reference at the end."
2,A disposable cute dress!,When my 2 year old girl received this gift she went nuts!!! she didn't want it to take it off but by the third time I washed it the dress started to ware out and brake.
1,BORDERS ON AND CROSSES OVER LINES OF ABSURDITY,"This type of book is a fine example of why an author should never write something without first studying the subject matter. It is one-sided. There are no realistic statistics provided. Both sides were not represented seriously. The conclusions are drawn popular tripe. An extremely poor work...even with syntax. BTW, I do not even play the game but have researched it since I first read this book and find the author's conclusions to be based on more fantasy than the game itself."
1,I wonder what her motives are.,"I am a realitivly new PC. However, I have read some of the Players Handbook pertaining to my character and have played about 4 sessions. I don't see anything wrong with the game at all. I am very down to earth. I have no desire to take my cat in my back yard and kill it. Besides, my character is lawful good and would dissaprove anyway."
1,A reader from Chile,"Be afraid... be very afraid, ja! If you want to waste your money buy this book. It's amazing what a lot of time and a lot of inteligence lack can do..."
1,Curiously this author got published.,"I do wonder why it was this book was ever published. I suppose should I ever desire to be published I should go to Starburst, since it seems they will print anything that comes across their desk. If you wish to waste money there are numerously better sources like taking a flame to your money. This book is a complete waste of anyone's time."
1,Hilarious,"The author is just hilariously incompetent when it comes to explaining what D&D is and is about. The ""Letter from a DM"" at the end appears to be a complete goof, either the author just made it up as a straw man or someone was having fun with her. It's really sad that this sort of thing was ever taken seriously. It is worth getting a used copy cheaply for the entertainment value."
3,The first was so much better,"The first 6 or so eps were good, after that it becomes very boring, battle after battle with none of the heroes getting hurt at all. Still it has its moments and some of them make up for the boring parts. Also it has a nice intro =-)"
1,Wasting Time and Money To Watch,"I brought this set because I thought this is the same as the OVA that I watched on TV before. But it is not, not at all. Two of the main charterers are duplicated, but the story line are completely replaced by a very stupid plot and some other else charterers. While the OVA is a very romantic story with complexity plot, the Chronicles of the Heroic Knight is just a superficial comic for up to 5 years old kid."
4,An aquired taste,"If your a fan of the original OVA series than you'll enjoy the TV series as well. Not as good as the OVA series but thats to be expected. The new intro definetely beats the old one in my opinion but the story isn't no where near as good as the first one. Parns new voice in the dubbed version is terrible and the animation quality isn't as good as the OVA. If your a die hard fan this is definetely worth adding to your library; if not, I suggest just renting them or borrowing them from a friend."
4,Really helpful!,System comes with a corded controller and that cord is really short so this was really helpful. I didn't have to get another wirless controller. Which right now are a lot so it'd be better to get a corded controller and this.
3,Its too short,"It was suppose to be about six feet, but I am 5'10 and its shorter than me. I give it around four feet. other than that, the product worked."
4,Great alternative to the Wavebird.,"I was looking for a way to use my Gamecube controller with my Wii without being limited by the controller's short cable length, and even considered purchasing a Wavebird wireless controller. However, the actual Nintendo-produced Wavebirds are pretty expensive and the cheaper knock-offs consistently get poor reviews. This extension cable was the perfect compromise. It works great, and for a fraction of the price of a Wavebird I can still sit my usual distance away from the TV and don't need to move the Wii to accommodate the limited length of my GCN controller's cord. Plus, I still get to use my quality Nintendo-produced controller and don't need to settle for a cheaper one (which, incidentally, would also cost more than this cable). Still, a wireless controller would be ideal, but this is a very effective and economic alternative."
4,An Amazing Wireless Controller,"This controller is an amazing third party controller. Usually I balk at buying third party controllers because their sensitivity doesn't seem to be as good as first party (those made by the system manufacturer).The receiver for the controller is very large, primarily because it has slots to accomodate memory cards. It is roughly the size of a computer mouse, much larger than other wireless receivers. Fortunately, it is able pick up the signal from quite a distance (10 ft), which was the reason I purchased it.The controller itself feels like the standard S-controller, just a bit lighter. You can turn vibration on or off, and turning it off gives you an impressive hundreds of hours of gameplay.I really like this controller, and find it to be a good substitute for its wired counterpart!"
3,Really great for a while...,"I really loved this controller until it started giving me trouble. It's comfortable, easy to use, and wireless. Unfortunately, after a while the buttons and triggers begin to stick, and it's usefulness ends. I tried a number of things to fix the problem, even going so far as to sand down the casing a bit, but it never stayed fixed for long.I got probably about 6 months of good use out of it, so it's not too bad, but I have yet to have any problems with a normal XBox (small) controller, even though mine's seen more use.It's really too bad that these small flaws showed up, or I'd still be using it."
2,great paperweight,"This is suitable as a remote control for XBMC, but not much good for gaming. The unresponsive buttons are vexing. I expected better from logitech."
5,Best Controller for XBOX,"You need to get used to this controller for a little bit, but when you get used to it, it becomes so nice to have a controller that doesn't have any cords. I've grown to like it more than even the controller S, however the buttons do have some problems with lag-time, but I got used to this problem as well and it doesn't bother me any more. This is by far the best controller for the XBOX."
3,Inconsistent response to commands,This controller is okay for beginners but I would not recommend it for those intent on getting the maximum performance out of their game. I use it mainly for Tiger Woods golf and find it difficult to get consistent levels of power boost and spin control even though I am only 10 to 12 feet from the receiver. This fact makes it pretty much useless for my purposes.
1,Poor longevity,Purchased 2 of these batteries as a replacement for my original that finally died and I am not impressed with the quality. I don't know what the difference is between the battery that came with the tool verses these replacement batteries but they don't last long at all after a full charge. Definitely not worth buying.
5,battery for DeWalt power screw driver,the battery was shipped on time - looks to be the real thing (not a fake) and charge right up and hold a charge and is workinh fine -
4,Battery works like new,I love my few years old DeWalt screw driver and rejoiced when I found that replacement batteries are available. The new battery was delivered on schedule and works as well as the batteries with the device when it was new. Thanks.
3,"Pretty pictures, but...","This book is remarkable for the images it contains, some of which I've never seen in any other publication (and I've been devouring books like this since I was in the 3rd grade in 1967).However, Dr. Reynold's prose borders on purple, the text is poorly edited, and for a book of this magnitude, the writing and reporting could have been stronger. I was suspicious about the written content when I read Wally Schirra's foreword, and my suspicions were confirmed when I read the whitewashing Reynold's gave the Apollo 7 flight (it made Schirra look like a misunderstood hero, and the NASA flight directors and administrators the bad guys, when everything else I've read about that flight would lead one to believe Schirra was several times on the edge of violating mission rules, and being less than cooperative).Still, the book is filled with beautiful images, and a new fact I'd never read about or heard explained before pops up on occasion."
5,Better than given credit for,I saw this movie in the theater. It's entertaining and certainly not as bad as some critics say. Especially the references to magic which is real and Egypt was/is the font of all true magic. How can anyone doubt when looking at the pyramids and other Egyptian wonders?
4,Awakening is a classic now,"just received my copy of THE AWAKENING -the version is the US DVD-R, it is definitely widescreen 1.85. Enhanced for 16:9, as stated on the back cover. Some minor print damage as can be expected for title this old (1980) but looks quite passable, much superior to previous versions only available on VHS in the US prior to now. Audio is Dolby Stereo (2.0) actually the music and dialog tracks are clear and robust for a film of this vintage. This is overall a satisfying late-night viewing experience. Now this movie is unique to me because it was always on late at night on TV in my household and was too late for my being able to stay up late enough to catch this. The fact that it rarely aired at all and now? This ""Warner Archive"" release makes THE AWAKENING special, and thus deserves a place in my library."
4,"Practical, direct to the point. No wasted paper!","I purchased it during my years in college. I refer to it every day. All of my acting classmates in college enrolled in the advanced acting courses and who have starred in my university's biggest productions have it, and the Drama Department director has it, and assigns it in his courses. It's one thing to understand it intellectually, but to use the material on stage without it being noticeable, even to the most observant critics, is another story."
4,A Life judge,This book is a biography of one of the best known boxing referee. It is the life story of how he came to this pinnacle through living a life dedicated to core principles.I always enjoyed seeing Mills on TV but never knew he had more impact on so many more people as a real life court judge.Great book.
5,This is the BEST blade for cutting stainless,"Mike is right--we have tried every other brand and the Dewalt is the best by far.Be sure to have your blade SHARPENED ($25) before it gets too dull, and you will get alot of life out of it.We fab Race Headers in 321 stainless, and usually get around 70 cuts between sharpenings.This beats the heck out of abrasive saws--just use common sense when cutting."
2,A Difficult Subject to Portray,"Not terribly moved, to be honest. Very little of it focuses on the texts from Revelation. The apocalypse is a subject that's very hard to try to put on screen because the texts in the book of Revelation are part metaphor and part literal. The events are only starting to occur now. Trying to capture on screen something that has not yet happened is pretty dodgy business.I'd skip it."
2,Could have done better,"This was an ""OK"" movie.I wish they would have went deeper into the book of Revelation then they did.It was a very loose based ""story"" of what may have happened.during the writing of the book.It wouldn't hurt if you watched this,but it may not help either.If you don't have a concept of the book you will be lost in the movie,I think"
5,"A ""Sword and Sandal"" Classic!","If you are a history buff, and a ""sword and sandal"" film guru, like myself, you will enjoy this film. It is an historically accurate account of the book of revelations[Bible], as it was visually imparted to John[Richard Harris], the last living disciple of Christ. Even if you are not religiously-inclined, you will no doubt be entertained, and impressed with Harris's well-earned command of the silver screen."
3,Batteries & no flashcard included,"I recently received my camera & am very pleased with the features. However, I was halfway thru setting up my camera when the batteries it came with started to go low & I was given the sign to ""replace the battery pack"". I am also disappointed with the fact that MY camera DID NOT come with a flashcard - I had to go out and purchase that from the store. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time!!!!"
3,My thoughts on the Canon A300,"It's great if you just need a point-and-shoot no fuss camera and optical zoom doesn't matter to you. It colors are gorgeous, especially outdoors during the day. Drains batteries like crazy, slightly over 20 photos and the battery was flat. Slightly bulkier that I'd like, but it's a Canon at a reasonable price. I use it primarily for email and web publishing so image quality is not very important to me."
4,My 1st Digi Camera,"I rec'd this digi camera for X-mas and so far have been very happy with it. I'm an old school claims adjuster and very used to my Nikon 35mm camera that I have been using for 19 years. I can't believe all I need to do is take the mem card to Wal-Mart and have the pics processed in 15/20 minutes. NO more film, processing and having to wait for a day or two to return to PU the film. I did buy the 128K mem card ... and rechargeable battery ..., but I find these costs reasonable considering the films packs I used to buy and then the film processing costs and travel time to pick up the film. From what I hear battery life is not to great but again I have been lucky. Although I have 4 spare batteries in my camera bag; I'm still on the first set . My boss has an Olympus and he goes through a 10 pack in a day. The pics are great along with the photo detail (very sharp 4X6's).Good luck with your camera. I'm very happy with mine."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought a Canon A300 to replace a lost Sony. I found the camera to be adequate except for two things: Battery life and delay upon hitting the photo button. Simply stated, the same type of batteries that last 18 hours in my mp3 player last 5 minutes in this camera. Battery life was consistent over several sets of batteries. Secondly, this camera is completely inadequate for taking pictures of small children because the children will have moved by the time the picture is processed. While the camera takes adequate pictures, I would not recommend it."
2,Not happy,"It takes good pictures, but I have absolutely no patience for this camera . . . it eats up batteries like CRAZY (I think one time a set of batteries ran out only after TEN minutes, ahhh!!). The other issue I had with it was that it takes FOREVER to snap a picture . . . everybody is sitting there smiling and waiting for the picture to take, and IT DOESN'T SNAP! I discovered quickly that I must be an impatient person, because I just don't have the time or money (on tons of batteries) to deal with this camera. I'm actually going to try to sell it on ebay or something, because it's in perfect condition, but yet I can't return it to the store anymore (anybody want to buy it?). I usually only buy canon and think it's an excellent brand and have some really nice higher-end cameras, but I just don't like this one very much and can't wait to get a different one . . ."
2,Nice features and good photos. Batteries a deal breaker,"You may notice other reviews mentioning the battery problem. They are not exagerating, We used up a set of batteries just setting the preferences. I thought it was just cheap batteries that came with the unit. We got it going and took about six pictures before the battery light came on and the screen went black. After the second set died after 7 pictures, we knew this wasn't going to work as a nice point and shoot digital. Too bad. The price is nice and the pictures came out very crisp and full of detail. But who can carry four sets of batteries to take as many pictures as a roll of film? Sorry Canon. Nice idea, but AA's do not power this piece of equipment. Go back to the drawing board."
1,Useless piece of crap,Even with alkaline batteries you can only take 4 or 5 shots before the batteries die. Less if you play with the menus. Canon should send a check to everyone who bought this piece of crap.
1,Canon service is horrible,Canon service is horrible. My camera has broken repeatedly and having it repaired has been a horrible experience- it took over three months to get it fixed!
4,SMALLEST CAMERA THAT TAKES PICS LIKE THE BIG LEAGUE,"If you need small cameras, you have to typically settle for picture quality that LOOKS like it came from a tourist gadget.Not this one! Despite its budget price (and what a steal it is) the colors are vivid and the pics sharp as crystal. Occasionally you could get overexposed results, but that's easily sorted out with white-balance settings.The only potential negative is the legend of barrel distortion on small Canon cams, but I still have to see what that looks like (and I take several architecture pics).A great steal of a small camera, it sure doesn't behave like one!"
4,Perfect entry level camera,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday. Picture quality is outstanding and the videos you can take are great also. Very easy to use, and for 50 bucks you can add a larger Compact Flash card so you can take hundreds of pictures or more video. It does come with a 16mb card which isn't bad for starters. Of course, as with any digital camera, rechargeable batteries are a good investment. The only thing missing on this camera would be optical zoom. I got this for under 100 bucks...unbeleivable!"
5,"Not a Senheiser, but not $2,000 either","As an indie filmmaker, I needed a decent shotgun mic on a budget. I had tried others and was weary about doing another one, but this mic has been quite awesome so far. I can't wait to get it on set, but if it performs like the tests I did at home, I'm not even remotely worried. I plugged it into my Zoom digital recorder and all runs perfectly well. Happy I made this purchase."
3,Good rental,"I just rented this game, and I guess it is ok for a first gen Xbox game, but overall kind of dissapointed. This game does have a few good concepts, but I personally feel that they weren't executed as well as they could have. Mission concepts for example are quite interesting, but unfortunately the first half of the game is way too easy. Then it gets way too hard all of a sudden. Unfortunately, that is were the real interesting mission concepts lay (attack on a harbour, escorting ships, etc). Graphically, water and boats are done with great detail, but the land is quite plain. In the end, I do feel that this game plays much better than MechAssault (a game that I personally did not like), but not by much. You can probably get all that is here out of a rental but you will probably be wasting space if you buy it."
1,this game [stinks],"this is one of those games that comes out with new systems way before it's ready...it'll be in the bargain bin soon. the graphics are mediocre as far as the x-box goes, game play is monotonous and ultimately boring, and sound isn't much better either. ultimately, this is an old school nintendo game with more speed and better graphics(nothing against nintendo, but i expect more nowadays), it wasn't even worth renting. i played it for an hour and then went back to project gotham..."
1,what,o.k. its called blood wake wheres the blood and a 7 yr old could beat this game easily I should know I watched one play this game sucks
2,Blood Wake not as good as it looks,"I was initially really excited to play this game. The demos made this game look amazing. I was hoping for a boat version of Twisted Metal II. Instead I got a boat version of Twisted Metal 1. Not nearly as good, and definately not worth $... The boats are all basically the same. The missions go from way to easy one minute to suicidal the next on the same difficulty setting.Do yourself a favor and get all of these games first:HaloMax PayneGenma Onimusha"
1,Even the replacement dvd froze up !!,"Brand new dvd had seven movies that were beautiful in both picture quality and sound. ""Buck Privates"" froze up for the first 8 minutes.Replacement dvd was even worse. ""Buck Privates"" had the exact same problem the first dvd had. To my suprise, ""Hold That Ghost"" froze up for the first 13 minutes. The remaining 6 movies were beautiful.......Volumes 2, 3 and 4 had no problems at all."
5,WOW,"comedy, comedy, everywhere, these guy's are so funny, and there clean too, like I mean your kids can watch themand won't walk away cussing and want to kill something or someone like the so called comedy today."
1,Truly an Amazing release- But....,Sorry guys I am another buyer who got not one defective copy but exchanged three times all defective!! Freezing skipping- I own over 200 DVD's this is the first defective one I've ever run across so in that sense I am lucky.I skipped over the bad spots and watched the films anyway and they have great quality prints and sound. And I see many reviewers lucked out with good copies so I am ever hopeful round four will go better.I grew up watching these films on Sunday morning TV and to get EIGHT on one disc is too good to believe. Abbott and Costello were brilliant they stole a lot of jokes from The Three Stooges (word for word at times) but they were still a very original duo.I bought my defective DVDs from Walmart not Amazon so maybe I am buying the older pressings. Hopefully I will hit one that is good because these guys are worth it and this is quite an extreme deal.
3,"""You and 20 million other guys.""","I agree with the reviewer who is appalled that there are customer reviews being posted before the DVD is even on the street. Keep your praise/shilling for Amazon to yourselves. Also, keep your calculations concerning cost per movie to yourselves, too!!! You're here to critique the DVD not to drull in anticipation. 3 Star rating reflects neutrality of reviewer."
5,This is a GREAT deal!,"I'm am utterly shocked that MGM is releasing these movies at this price. As long as the dvds are in nice quality, and they don't give us a cheap product, this may be the best bargain I've ever seen. ... In my opinion, this collection is a test product to see how future A n B movies should be released . . . meaning, if you don't buy this collection soon, you'll be paying 50 for it in about 6 months. Great deal!"
1,Should have listened to the other reviews.......,"I like many grew up watching Abbott & Costello every Sunday morning and looked forward to recieving the DVD. I only ordered volume one due to other reviews stating the poor quality. I too found the quality to be, lets say, lacking. I thus far have only attempted to watch the first 4 movies, 2 of which, ""One night in the Tropics"" and ""In the Navy"" freeze half way through and are unwatchable. I had no problem with ""Hold that Ghost"", one of my favorites. ""Buck Privates"" hesitates occasionally but does complete."
2,too simple,it was fun but easy and not the best graphics. i got through it in one day on the normal level and i couldn't change it to hard. it was a cheap thrill for a day
4,Son's Call of Duty 3,My son has enjoyed this game. It has provided challenges for him and keeps him go back to try again.
4,PERSPECTIVE,"This book- As are all of Eric's books, are entertaining and interesting, well written, and offer an interesting perspective on things and geographical area's outside of the typical radar shadow."
2,Dead End,"The narrator does a wonderful job of weaving the reader throughout this book. A sense of urgency is created as the problem of an unidentified killer builds within a small town. Everyone is guilty, perhaps no one is. But the book, no pun intended, dies at the end. A real disappointment."
2,blah,"hackneyed, overdrawn, and without juice, basically hopeless. proof that those who can't do, teach. king at least was honest."
5,Dobyns Best,"There are so many reviews here for this book it's hard to say anything original. Dobyns is also a poet and the author of the Charlie Bradshaw mystery series (highly recommended). This novel is less a mystery and more like a thriller; actually, it's proper classification is probably horror, as things happen in the book that are not for the squeamish and the subject matter is quite dark. Like The Two Deaths of Senora Puccini, we have an unreliable narrator, who is unknown yet firmly developed as a character. He relates the tale of a serial killer and the inhabitants of a small town and what happens to them as they become suspicious of each other after the disappearance of three young girls. As in other Dobyns novels, he has excellent characterization and a very slow developing yet fascinating plot. Dobyns is an incredible wordsmith and having read nearly all of his books, I feel this along with Two Deaths of Senora Puccini is his best."
3,Disappointment,"I read the entire novel, even though 1/3 through I felt that this could be better served as a novella. I tried to keep up with the characters and their 'secrets' but that wasn't necessary. The killer was outside the range of suspected characters and I missed whatever clues were provided pointing me in the killers direction. I am still not sure why or what creates the schism of the killer. So...it's not an easy read. The first 3 chapters are well written and enticing but after spending over 20 chapters following the character development I wasn't satisfied with the resolution. Sorry to say, I felt the writer grew weary and let momentum take over. On the other side maybe I missed his 'rationale.' He's knowledgeable of sociology and there may be a message in the subgroup's interaction with the populous but I can't tell. My lack of education leaves me wondering."
3,Get It At The Library,"Dobyns novel unfortunately sets you up with a quote from Stephen King, which was probably nothing Dobyns had any control over. It describes how this book should be read on a spooky night, etc. This is not a mystery per se. It is not even particularly horrific (except in its opening pages). What it is is Our Town meets Lord of the Flies. It's about paranoia and vigilantism in the face of an unknowable killer and how the natural reaction of a town's banding together, reveals its dark secrets and fear of anything abnormal. The novel is ""between two stools,"" in that it's really a study of small town psychology, with the mystery, the killer as the MacGuffin. Of course, the publicists sell it as a mystery and get Stephen King to endorse a quote. Overall, the book has inspired sections, and a fast-paced ending, but it drags considerably throughout."
1,A big dissapointment,"I was totally dissapointed with this book. It began really scary but ended abruptly when it shouldnt have. The worst thing about it is that it could have been better, judging from how it started."
2,A yawner!,I can't recommend this book. I struggled through two-thirds of this book before it became mildly interesting. The ending seemed rushed and the true killer was revealed much too quickly. His demise was disappointing also. I wanted a better cat & mouse game at the end. I'm going back to Stephen King -- sorry Mr. Dobyns.
3,Read it for the narration,"The best thing in this novel is the (unnamed) narrator. What's interesting about him, is that although he is really outside of the events taking place in the story, his character is fully developed. Everything he tells us is unmistakably colored by what we learn about his personality; he is an observer, though not an impartial one. I can't recall ever reading another first-person narrated book where the narrator is not a central character, and yet is a complex and interesting person in his own right.That said, the story itself is well-written and engaging enough-as others have said it is the town's reaction to the girls' disappearances rather than the mystery itself that is most absorbing. It isn't the spine-tingler you might expect, though it has its moments, and the finale is pretty darn exciting. All in all a good read."
5,"Dark, psychological horror","Dobyns has created a masterpiece of psychological horror. A small upstate New York town descends into suspicion and fear as, one by one, three girls vanish without a trace. This is not a traditional mystery, but there are plenty of twists and turns for the reader. The last few pages will leave you chilled. This exploration of the dark side of the human psyche is strongly recommended for fans of Stephen King and Thomas Harris"
3,Not your conventional thriller,"Being from a small town myself, I enjoyed the author's take on how paranoia, suspicion, and panic, could grip a formerly sleepy little berg. But in terms of structure, there were too many characters that were either weakly fleshed out or plot lines that simply didn't go anywhere."
4,compactor bags,"the bags were what I needed but I should have checked Costco-they had them at considerable lower prices without shipping. However, Costco cannot be trusted to always have the bags in stock."
1,"NOT MUCH FUN, January 14, 2002","I have always liked the Flintstones. When I looked at the box, it looked like it would be a fun game. Boy, was I wrong. First, there is no save feature. Second, this game is fairly challenging even on ""easy"" mode. And without a save feature, how will you ever get through the game. Last but not least, the ""enemies"" have too many unfair advantages as you do not have the ability to look around when you are climbing or jumping. I definitely do not recommend this for children. It is a very frustrating game. The graphics aren't bad and the control is okay, but who wants to play a game in one sitting. Don't waste your money on this one. There are too many other good platform games out there to buy."
3,returned since it did not come as described,We returned the item because it came as just the cartridge not the game/instruction booklet in box as believed.We had already had the cartridge and were looking for the instruction booklet-since it was inexpensive we figured it would have been worth the purchase-too bad it did not work out the way we expected.
1,sexually perverse,"I find Mamet's plays sexist, racist, homophobic and aurally irriating. Sexual Perveristy in Chicago is no better. I don't know how he keeps getting the glowing reviews that his plays garner. I could list many plays that never got the glowing reviews Mamet's plays get - that are a thousand times more deserving. I keep reading his plays with an open mind, trying to find in it the reason for the hype, and i've never once found it. gather your own opinion, but I to this day I have not found one redeeming quality in his work, and I think this play is probably the worst as far as sexism and close-mindedness goes."
3,Smelly,"This smells worse than the previous salmon oil I bought and the bottle was oily on the outside (even after being washed off). Somehow, it leaks after pumping. I know it's good for my dogs, so we finally finished it, but I will look for the stuff I had last time (gold metal bottle- can't remember name)."
3,okay for a laugh,"this is book is really for comedic purposes only. it doesn't have any real useful advice, but maybe it could be a good way to ease people into accepting your choice if you leave it sitting out somewhere visible."
1,Wasting a Big Chance at Satire,"This book was a huge disappointment. I know it is supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual for those who chose to remain child-free. I expected it to provide some form of witty social commentary. Instead it wallowed around in the tired ""aren't babies stinky and dirty"" territory instead of providing comic relief. I was greatly disappointed by the lack of clear, intellectual humor and insight."
5,Not a book to be read from cover to cover........BUT........,A book to refer to through out one's life - very grounding.
4,"Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, Harry Browne vs the USPS.","I read ""How I Won Freedom In An Unfree World"" all the back in 1974 in Cambridge, MA at the same time as Mr. Browne's predictions on gold and the economy. Perhaps with the its republication we will see the return of rocketing gold.Browne gives us a map of the psychic focus a person needs to play and win by taking care of business. Browne is an American teacher of self-reliance just as Emerson was. Dale Carnegie was another. In fact, all the writers we as Americans seem to like and quote: Hemingway, Mailer, Emily Dickinson all find their own way to individuation, to being able to be themselves. Since I was driving a cab in Harvard Square at the time of my first reading of Browne's book, his suggestions about how to interpret the economy in which we live, and how to do business in it, are quite affirmative and useful."
5,A Must Read,"Many pages are folded in half; I wrote notes everywhere, and highlighted many lines. It had to be a GREAT book for me to do that. ""Not only managing the sale, but managing the relationship"" cleared up so many things for me. The book gave me a much greater sense of direction. An affluent one."
1,Very heavy. Shape is odd,"I found these sunglasses very bulky and heavy. Also, they dont have any curve at the top, so they look kinda odd. Will have to return these."
1,$#!T,"This is absolutely the worst $#!T I have ever heard, Chicken Noodle Soup has to be one if not the worst song ever made, please stop making and ban this album for everyone's sake."
3,Pretty adequate,"The original one I got with the phone (LG VX4400) stopped working and I just wanted a replacement. The ones with a volume control seemed to cut down on the volume and the sound wasn't as clear as before. This one seems to work better although not like the first one. It isn't flashy and, of course, the newer phones are all going Bluetooth but I tend to hang on to devices until they die and this earpiece works for me."
2,Print Shop 22 Deluxe Review,"I owned Print Shop 12 and it didn't communicate with the color printer fonts I had for five years, so I didn't work with it much. I got a new Dell printer and tried it again, this time it printed fonts with good translation. So I upgraded to the newest Print Shop version. I have to say that the new version in what I do isn't that much different from the old. The only feature I see that wows me is the internet access I now get, which wasn't available five years ago. It was a disappointment to have spent the money on the upgrade when I could have used version 12 and used the money wiser by dining out. I'm back to using Publisher, an older version, that does quite well with newsletters."
3,It works.,"The user experience of all software is extremely important to me.With this being version 22, I expect more than has been delivered.In my opinion, the user interface needs to be overhauled.The text of my projects has no font smoothing so the text is blocky on my LCD monitor.The icons on the tool bar (print, save, etc.) are very unattractive.The user interface isn't much of an improvement over the version 6 that I was using previously.But, version 6 printed text in bitmap mode and looked just awful. The printing looks just fine in this version.If I did lot's of this type of stuff, I'd spring for Microsoft Publisher instead."
2,There must be something better out there . . .,"I'm new to desktop publishing and wanted to expand my horizons buy purchasing something other than a Microsoft product. I find the tool is not as robust as I had hoped for but then again the price of the product should have told me this. I didn't find the interface intuitive and agree with a previous review regarding bringing graphics into the program is a bit obnoxious. Converting your work to a .pdf is nice but it doesn't always work so great neither does web-page conversion. This could be the way I'm trying to use the tool (for a newsletter) and my inexperience. Although the tool is working for me, I don't find that its all that easy or robust enough for what I'd like to do. I think I'm going to be keep looking for another tool to help me produce a newsletter on paper and easily on the web."
5,Printing cards software,The Print Shop 22 Deluxe [OLD VERSIONOn Time delivery and the product still contines to do what it says it will. If you have time you can be very creative with this product.
2,Too laborious!,"Unless you are prepared to unload and load CD's into the drive repeatedly to get the graphics, avoid purchasing this. If that doesn't bother you, the price is certainly right. I found it to be a real pain...."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Without question, a horrible program. Everything is hard even the easiest is hard. It's just awful!! I've used many desk top publishing programs and there are none as bad as this."
1,Software manufacturers are Nuts...,"This product's various versions prove that the computer industry, and the corporate world included have yet to learn that there many millions of Macintosh owners that are beginning to hate all their products for ignoring the Mac's presence. Why is it that so few recognize that Apple isn't going away, and that the Mac is catching on so fast, even in this terrible financial turmoil, that soon it will be the dominant computer, and its system will be the most stable in the retail industry?"
1,Not for making photo cards and graphics are silly,"If you are looking to make photocards, don't buy this. I bought it because I wanted to save $$ buy making my own cards like the ones you get from w*lmart and w*lgreens. the graphics are horrible for nice cards. I would say this is good for a teacher or a school admin making memo's. But the graphics are basic or cheesy and none are elegant. I feel like I wasted $20 - thank god i didn't pay full price."
5,A Truly Delightful Quest,"This is one of the most light-hearted and enjoyable books I have read in quite some time. I think it is the best Gerald Morris has done yet, and I have thoroughly enjoyed his three previous novels. I can sincerely recommend it to adults who enjoy a humor-studded story as well as to younger readers."
3,Gerald Morris is going Downhill,"I was really disappointed with this book...Of all his books so far, this one was the least funniest and almost completely tragic. Also, one of the techniques that the author employs a great deal in this book is character maturity and growth. If you want to read ""How quickly a character may mature in 100 pages or less"" definately read this book. I would have never thought that Morris could write about something so boring and common place. Originally I liked Morris books because I felt he mocked social norms..but in this book he completely disappointed me..."
4,Not enough Arthurian stuff in it.,"This book wasn't my favorite. First, Piers go on a quest with one knight, then out of nowhere, Parsifal comes and takes over. And a lot of the fantasy was hard to imagine."
2,Flying Changes very sophmoric,"After Water for Elephants, Flying Changes is a deep disappointment. Unlike ""Water"" Flying Changes has almost no plot line, no character development, no humor, no intelligence, and a stupid ending. It seems as though the two books were written by two entirely different authors. Flying Changes is not worth the price of money nor time."
2,Lame,"Read this book if:You enjoy a fantastically unrealistic portrayal of the competitive horse world.Unbelievable fantasy.Whiny, spoiled characters.Adult temper tantrums.Fluffy, lack of substance reading.Stay away if:You like your facts to have some semblance of accuracy.You enjoy stories that could possibly happen in the real world.You are annoyed by horrible parenting, decision making, and relational skills/maturity."
3,Flying Changes,I had read another book by the author Sara Gruen and really enjoyed it. So I chose another title by the same author and was disappointed that it wasn't of the same quality writing. I don't know if I'm supposed to rate the physical condition of the book (which was very good) or the content of the book(which was rather blah). I was very please with the puchasing and delivery process through Amazon.
2,"Good book, bad publisher","This book is pretty decent, pretty much what I was expecting, except the publisher, Addison-Wesley, has stopped shipping the book with a CD. Instead there is a note in the book instructing you to go to their website for a downloadable version of the CD.Surpise! No downloads available for this title!The CD contains all of the code from the book, project files, sample sounds, and code that is not in the book, so in my opinion, the CD contents are pretty necessary.So far I have written them several times (very politely) with no response and I've spent hours on the phone trying to get this problem resolved, only to get transferred to four or five people and eventually transferred to a recorded message saying that they ""cannot take my call at this time"" and to call back.So... do not buy this book unless you don't mind not getting the CD."
2,Disappointed that recording is not covered!,"I am SO disappointed in this book! I am a programmer who wants to record .wav files, and from the title you would think this would get at least cursory coverage! But be warned, this book has NOTHING, absolutely zero, about recording!I am keeping the book because of its information on Fourier Transforms, but am back to square one in search of a true programmer's reference book on sound!!Amazon, warn your potential buyers, please!"
3,"Good sound format information and overview,","I used this book as the basis for a real time speech program and I found that although the book gave a good overview of the way that Win95 uses sound playback, the code was too complicated. The object oriented nature of the code was a good idea except that it seemed that there was a lot of uneeded code, for example queue implementations were too complex. Also there could have been better coverage given to synchronisation objects like semaphores in the code. Overall quite helpful but the code can be optimised in some places."
1,Lousy customer service,"Had this camera for two months then got the infamous ""E18"" error. Canon refused to honor the warranty and charged me [money amount]to fix it.This error is wide spread and well documented on many web sites. Canon said it my fault. Too bad, we liked the camera, but we will NEVER BUY ANOTHER CANON PRODUCT."
2,Beware the infamous E18 error,"I purchased this camera almost 2 years ago. 6 months ago, it displayed the first occurence of the E18 error (problem in the lens mechanism), but recovered. It did that again last week and could not recover. Both times, it happened when I was on vacation. Search the web for E18 and you'll know what I mean. So, now I have a useless paperweight not worth spending money to get repaired. Now I will go for another canon, but an older model with a digital-only zoom, for 2 reasons a) the optical zoom on the A60 has give me enough grief, b)to keep using my 2 CF cards, since the latest cameras do not accept CF cards."
2,garbage,"I've had this camera for almost 4 years and it had completely stopped working. The lens doesn't open anymore. The camera has taken decent pictures, but sometimes the photos have come out with fuzzy gray lines across them. I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you plan on having trouble with it in the future."
2,Dud camera,"My husband and I bought this camera, it worked for 2 days and just stopped reading the flash. The pictures we actually did take were wonderful but who thinks that what you will buy will stop working less than 2 weeks after you bought it?"
1,BEWARE DEFECTIVE CAMERAS,This camera was recalled with defective CCD sensors. Canon no longer supports or repairs this camera. If you are buying a used camera it is most likely defective.That was the case for me.
4,"Mo better, faster, nicer.","I have replaced the stock filter in my vehicles in four of the last five vehicles that I have owned. Always with great results and outcome, more power, better economy. While I waiting for the new filters to seat completely in my benz, I can tell the general improvement in intake aspiration and there seems to be a smoother transistion in power flow, we'll see after a couple more weeks. If for no other reason alone, changing to a K&N filter will save $$$$ from the dealer, every 40-50K in most benzes 40$ for the filter and 100$ for the labour, and you do this just once. And by the way, you will need two for most of the six and eight cylinder applications for this filter. My e350 took two and most of the v6 c classes will too."
4,The Cd is excellent and very spiritual.,"The songs, the beats, and the message are all encouraging. The song Thank You, I believe is the highlight of the albulm. It is my favorite song with a powerful meaning, so I listen to it everyday. Watch out Gods Property, TM is coming out."
4,"ok, but","The book was good, except that it seems too difficult items came too soon, thereby slowing some students in their learning."
4,Shapechanging magic,"I read the series out of order many years ago and had forgotten how she slowly built up this shared world and played in it. I can remember being lost by starting in the middle but it was definitely still a readable book. To start now at the beginning has been a much easier experience. You get a good taste of the world that she plays in for many generations of the family of Cheysuli. I'm thrilled to see it in print again after the last few have become impossible to find and they are definitely worth getting if you haven't read them before. Standing up well to the test of time and her writing ability, Jennifer Roberson is one of my favorite authors for a very fantasy and relationship driven book."
2,Made in China need I say more?,"Lousy performance overall, stays sharp for 3 cuts then dulls out... Milwaukee has them made in China which accounts for the sub-standard quality... Can't we build anything in the USA anymore?"
2,HOYLE TABLE GAMES,"GAME ARE FUN BUT YOU HAVE TO USE THE DISK TO PLAY THE GAMES, WHICH IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT."
3,"Fun, short, & dark","Fun game. Very old-school.However, it is soooo D-A-R-K and hard to see! That is the biggest drawback to this game.It does seem a little short, but it was still fun. Wait till it hits under $... and you can't miss."
1,none,"This book is completely ludicrous. What it is basically, is someone refusing to take responsibility for their own actions. This is basically a 200 page excuse for something that was completely wrong. It is terribly horrendous that Koon should be able to capitilize on his criminal activity."
5,ALL I GOTTA SAY IS...,"buy it, it's great, i love it and i can't wait to EO comes out on gamecube to see what it has to offer."
5,Deep Sea big squeeze knife,This is the best dive knife I have owned. It's slim line profile minimizes the chance of kelp tangling around the knife. The best feature is the positive locking action. The knife is very simple to remove and replace into the scabbard. Simply squeeze the sides of the handle. No need to find buttons or clips etc. Very important if your wearing heavy gloves in colder climates.
3,Cold glimpse into British upper crust,"First third is not very good. Second third is riviting: a portait of an addicted young man on the prowl for drugs in Manhattan; final third is very good: deft, sketches of British aristos, at a country house party, with a very high wire act impersonation of a named Royal, Princess Margaret. I was surprised at how rivited I was by the book's middle passage. The author really makes you feel the dislocation and psychological suffering of his very damaged central character."
1,Not a good vacuum!,"I purchased the Vision because it was in my price range, and because I've had good experiences with Dirt Devil, and with bagless vacuums, in the past.The biggest issue I have with this model is the method necessary to empty the dirt canister. Some design genius decided it was a good idea to put the filter ON TOP of the canister. So every time you empty the canister, you have to remove the filter first. Your hands get dirty; dust, dirt and hair get dumped all over the vacuum and the floor. The process makes such a mess, you have to vacuum again after you empty the canister.Also, the power cord storage is illogical and inconvenient. The cord wraps around the on-board tools in back. It frequently gets hung up in the tools, and it's difficult to see the bottom hook, to wind the cord around it.Overall, I would say this model is one big design flaw."
5,i also read computers for dummies and both are informative,"This book will answer all your questions especially the ones your afraid to ask... or should be. EX: My brother once asked my mother how she got the daffidils to all face the same direction!!! lol...he never lived it down! Read this book and have a great garden ""painlessly""."
3,Nice one,"Excellent quick reference, but not for newcomers. Shows good details, very nice illustrations and should be on the shelf in every serious Physiotherapy Clinic."
3,Trigger Point Book,"The book is a bit technical, but the illistrations are very good. It is easy to follow by using the illistrations."
5,Was exactly what I wanted! For a good price too!,"I am a massage therapist, and in school I used this book as a reference. Of course it wasn't mine. Now that I am working out on my own its great to sit back and test my knowledge or just to review every now and again. This book provides just that. Its broken down into great detail, and easy to follow. It also provides great stretching examples, for every muscle in the body. The book is definately a great buy for any body worker, even for a study guide after school."
3,A little disappointed,"This book is a wealth of information on pain referral patterns for any particular muscle, so in that regard I find it very valuable. However it does not give exact information on how to massage trigger points but focuses almost exclusively on how to stretch to relieve targetted muscular pain as well as strengthening exercises but nothing on how to massage these particular trigger points to help break up the spasm. The pictures are grouped regionally so as to find the affected muscle quickly but since the title said Trigger Point Therapy for Myofascial Pain: The Practice of Informed Touch I kinda expected more of the informed touch aspect."
3,"Entertaining, but strains credulity","I really enjoyed ""A Working Stiff's Manifesto"". I would have enjoyed it even more if I didn't have a constant, nagging feeling that Levison was taking liberties with the truth. I have no evidence that he was exaggerating or fabricating, but that was my gut feeling.Also, I wondered why he didn't reveal more details about his life outside of his jobs -- his family (if any), his age, which college he attended, etc.All in all, this book was an easy, entertaining read -- but it left me unsatisfied."
4,"A visit to another time, another place.","Word usage quite different from present day. A leisurely visit to the early days of Nebraska and Iowa at the turn of the century. Several short stories and three novels, none of which were predictable. I would recommend to anyone who can enjoy a relaxed read."
3,It was ok...,"Ya know... it was pretty good. The only thing is that they recorded it in a bar so the sound isn't really top notch... however, it gives you a good feel for the true spirit of the band."
1,Very disappointing!,"I was very disappointed when I received my copy of this book.Initially, my displeasure centered round the unprofessional editing. The book appears to be in draft form as typos abound, the formatting is inconsistent and the overuse of uppercase letters left me gasping. And these are just a few of the points that should have been rectified before publication!The actual content is poor to fair, but it's difficult to read because of the glaring editorial mistakes. The book contains too many exercises and very little concrete information.I would not recommend this book. It's a waste of money."
2,Not much new,There are only a few articles added each week. Not enough new items to keep my interest.
1,so disappointed!,"I have been happily receiving Huff Post with updates daily if not 3-4 times a day for about the past 6 months. When I hadn't received an update for over 5 days, I inquired with Kindle/Amazon customer service. I was told that now it is on a weekly update schedule. How disappointing - I canceled my subscription immediately. Sorry, Arianna!"
1,Not Good,Lacks quality material. Just more poor stories. Might as well be a blog page. Look at other choices first. Found most writings to be lacking any merit
2,"Interesting concept, painfully boring","I could say that this game hasn't aged well, but that doesn't make up for the immense sense of, well emptiness, that seems to pervade every aspect. From the total silence of space, to the wide black expanses, vague mission objectives and snail-paced story, I never really felt pulled in and engaged. The full 3D real time strategy, while a cool idea, is difficult to manage and the graphics end up just looking like a bunch of colored polygons flying around in random directions.You really have to WANT to like this game to be able to get into it. The fact that it was well-received by the gaming press when it came out, I'll chalk up to over-enthusiasm at the sight of something new."
2,Usual,"This book is run of the mill. People write tons of books or magazines dealing with IR (and politics). There is no science and everybody has opinions. I find this one not incisive.Save your money. There is the idea that Europe ""needs"" the USA. Many Europeans would disagree. Two different entities with different goals. There are more productive jobs than editing and publishing these opinions."
3,Interesting book,"Having many adopted children, one with specific attachment issues, and a few with other rejection issues, I was reading about this book, it seems to be a ""love or hate"" relationship. I finally purchased it. It needs to be read with an open mind, as some of it seems wierd. However, if you READ it, and don't SKIM it, and when you start to sweat when you read something that flys in the face of what seems a logical way to deal with something, you might see a glimplse of wisdom breaking through the clouds.I have found the book helpful to an extent, but it is a rather thin book for the price. I would have liked to have seen more detail with actual case studies.I would definitly recommend the book, but as with all books. Take what is good, throw out the bad, and walk away with something valuable to use."
5,"Hope for Those Labeled ""Hopeless""","While I haven't had time to try the methods yet, this is the most hopeful book I've read about dealing with children with RAD and other issues surrounding abandonment. It deals with the root causes, not the resulting behaviors, and gives concrete examples of appropriate responses to common issues."
3,Objects in Pictures May Be Smaller than They Appear.,"I bought this for a small project, for a gift for a dear friend in a production of Beauty and the Beast. I was going to put A clear sticker (window decal) on the mirror, so that when someone looks into it, they see the beast but themselves as well. It was just an idea that I had. Well, I misunderstood the dimensions of this mirror, and it was so tiny that I couldn't fit a picture of the Beast at all. IT IS VERY SMALL. I wish I hadn't bought it... or wasted the money on the fast (yeah right) shipping. If you want a short, small hand mirror, get it."
5,Off the Grid is off the charts!,"Off the Grid, like the other Warren Miller movies, is a great movie for any ski fanatic."
4,"Long lasting commuter, a little heavy.","I'm on Amazon looking for new tires, as my Hutchinson Globetrotters have finally warn out. What I can say about these wheels is that I commuted off this pair for 3 years, and they easily supported my weight (240 pounds) plus load without in pinch punctures even at low psi. I never had a single flat the whole time, which is a lot more than I can say the tires I had beforehand. These are big heavy tires with a lot of rubber, so its not surprise they don't get punctures, you do pay for it with weight. However if your looking for a tough resilient 700 tire at this price point, these are a great deal."
2,Not worth the money,Looking at the quality we received the CD bag is just too costly. Its no better than those available in Wall Mart for $15. I am too lazy to initiate a return...
3,It's Okay...,"I purchased about 8 of these over the last 18 months. The first five I purchased had a nice handle on the end and the CD/DVD holder were held in place by a set of bowed plastic guides which allowed for easy viewing and lots of room when you opened and were looking through the case. Zipper opened and closed very easily. Since then, the last three purchased have changed considerably. The sleeves are now sewn into place and there is less room/space when you open and the CD/DVD do not lay completely flat. The handle on the end is gone and the zipper is hard to close after being opened all the way due to an excess of nylon fabric. The lack of a handle also makes it less easy to handle. These are may be minor but the quality of the case has deteriorated and the price has not gone down. I won't buy anymore of this style and will look for a better made case - it's just ok and it is disappointing to see the decline in quality."
2,Not as good as before,The exterior of the case is well constructed but the side flaps and the zipper are of very low quality. I have been using Caselogic for a few years now and the ones i bought many years ago are still going strong. I am afraid the zipper will not last a few years it looks really fragile.
4,Does the job,This is great for the price. The case has good and solid construction. The only complaint i have is the fact that the zippers go too far back when the case open. This makes it a bit hard to easily and quickly open/close the case.
3,"Enormous case, holds plenty, zipper unusable","The case is great. Holds all my DVDs and then some. However, the zipper is difficult to close (with two hands) and impossible to close (with one hand)."
3,pretty good,"they definitely holds a ton of CDs but the pockets could be just a smigg bigger to easily fit booklet and cd in the same pocket better. otherwise, it holds cds just fine."
4,"It's a CD wallet, people.","It works. It holds a bunch of CDs/DVDs. you can't add more envelopes, but it's fairly hard sided, so it'll protect your discs from impact for all those times you want to play lawn hockey with your cd wallets.the zipper zips. the pockets hold discs. what else do you want?"
4,CaseLogic Review,"The styles of this Koskin has changed from the the ones that I have bought in the past. The quick sleeve inside the case is no longer removeable and the part where the zippers are is no longer koskin...it's vinyl. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. Regardless, it is still one of the best DVD/CD cases out there.Also, caselogic customer support is outstanding if you ever need a warranty replacement."
2,Ok but not great,I thought this product was pretty good but would it hurt the maker to make the sleeves a little bit bigger. When you have as many CD's and DVD's as I have you would at least like to insert the folders or album covers so you can identify the disc.
3,Case Logic 280,"The product is well made but not as exceptional as the reviews I read would lead me to believe. My fault, I thought it would be great to have so many CDs in one place, but the truth is that 280 discs are heavy and the pages do not handle the weight idealy. You also have to have a large enough open surface to open it up on. I would opt for more ""wallets"" of a smaller size for my future storage needs."
3,No removable storage included,"The case itself is a great product. I ordered two for my boyfriend how has burned a ton of movies and just kept them on the DVD spindles. He was able to fit them all in the cases with room to spare. Neither of them came with the removable storage. So far, so good."
5,All in one storage,This is a great all-in-one CD storage pouch. I use it a lot to store music/software/games/movie cds and the additional pouches on the front/back cover also helps with storage! A must buy if you have a large collection of CDs and want just a single storage system!
5,Great Storage for your DVD's,I got this along with a vhs to dvd recorder and 100 blank dvd's. This is a great little binder to keep all of our family movies in order and safe. I may have to get another one already though. lol
4,"Useful, but no fast file removable..","Not exactly what I wanted being the 16 fast file inner front are not removable (to carry without taking the whole case).. I was going to get the Koskin type, but I wanted to see how the nylon case looks- both types do not really matter to me- but I did want the removable front cover fast file that holds 16 CD-DVD.. Either way it hold my collection of CD’S, so I’m happy.."
4,cd holder,Great in that it lies flat for easy insertion and visibility. A little on the large size. Would have enjoyed it being smaller. Couldn't find one that lies flat. That is a huge plus.
5,I love it!,"I put all my CDs with the CD inserts cause I wanted to keep them, and have been able to consolidate into this small space-saving wallet CDs and movies."
5,Exceeded every expectation.,"This case is phenomenal. We have stripped all our DVDs of their cases and use cases like these to store our collection. The binding that holds the pages in this case is so genius, simple and functional. I would recommend this case to everyone looking for something that allows you to store you movies neAtly. I have not had to re position a page at all since purchasing this, which is usually a problem with cases and removable sleeves... Fortunately the design is such that the binding has a complete lock that holds all the pages in place, keeping tHe pages from snagging or catching on a typical binding. Great product. Would buy again when we need another to store our collections."
4,Good Product!,"Great CD case. It does what it's intended for a cheap price. The only drawback for me is that the zipper gets stuck underneath this flap thing and it gets annoying to get back the right way. Other than that, it's a great product."
4,Very nice!,"I was a bit worried about how well the pages would stay in, but I don't think that'll be a problem. Because of the mechanism to lock/unlock the straps, they come out easily and stay closed very securely. The case is a little bigger than I need (should have gotten one size smaller). The handle is kind of stupid as it doesn't hardly give enough room to fit a hand under to carry. The nice thing about it though is a hand slips in and stays tightly for sorting while holding the whole case on an arm. It's nice for looking through, but not for carrying."
4,Good deal for the money.,"I bought this to use for photo CD's I got through quite a few photographing and having an album to store them in makes it a lot easier and faster to find what I'm looking for. I bought 2 of them and probably will get another one before too much longer.Pros: Holds a lot of CD's.Case/cover is fairly sturdy and zips easily.Easy to flip pages.Cons: Feel pages are a bit ""flimsy"" at times but it holds up and I mostlikely won't remove CDs in and out that often, this is more of astorage unit for me, since the jewel cases were getting out ofhand (over 150 of them).I think it will do good for what I need. The only thing I think I""ll miss is some sort of plastic page or cover where I can insert some sort of indexing page so I can easily find what I need. Other than that its a good one. Will probably buy another one just like this next time, its a very good deal."
5,Great Reference and Learning,"I have been looking for several years for a good primer on ""modern bridge"" Most were copywrited a number of years ago and don't reflect current practice. A great read and a good reference on basic bridge!"
2,Gray and dissapointing,"I was less than thrilled with this book, for which I had high expectations. For one things, the ""illustrated by"" suggestion on the cover is a joke. There are very very few, small illustrations. Also, I find that many of the topics of poems in the book are inappropriate or incomprehensible to kids. Likewise, many of the poems have language that is not practical for kids and will likely only confuse them."
5,A Child's Anthology of Poetry,"As a former English teacher, a mother and grandmother, I cannot give enough praise to the poems in this anthology. They are not condescending or silly. Many are poems that were not written for children but that children can understand. The poets represented are outstanding poets from many periods in both American and English literature."
2,Like watching paint dry,"This film's pacing is torturous. Not much of a plot, either. The acting is very amateurish. If the firector was serious he wouldve gotten trained actors instead of making a cheap play for street cred by casting indie musicians in the main roles. With the exception of some characters who overact, most of the characters overacting are borderline catatonic. It's like a zombie movie movie without the blood and gore."
1,it [stunk],this game was so fake i mean you could fly up 50 feet in the air land on the MIDDLE of the vert and do a wall tap. When you ramp up a vert it is so hard to land backwards or fowards you need to land just right. When you land backwards its hard to steer and it slows you down so when you go off another vert you crash because its so slow. The wierd thing is that u can do a flip and manual flip then manual.... THIS GAME [bites]
2,Not as fun as it looks,My husband and I love the Tony Hawk game so I thought we would like this one too but I was wrong. The graphics are OK and the levels are expansive but that's about all you get with this game. Its nowhere near as fun as Tony Hawk.
5,The Maxims of Rober E. Lee For YOung Gentlemen,I am a KA and am proud of this book. It not only gives a rounded picture of the General but also lets us in on his thought processes for one of the toughest times of our nations history.
3,"It Needed More ""True Story"" and Less Opinion","Based on a True Story tells the ""real facts"" behind dozens of movies that are supposedly based on real people and stories - from blockbusters like Erin Brockovich to more obscure films. The stories are often fascinating and revealing. But the authors' analysis often left me frustrated - they obviously give certain films more leeway than others when it comes to bending the truth. One film might ignore inconvenient facts, and it's dismissed as ""blatant pandering"", but another movie might do something almost identical and it's called ""fulfilling the director's vision"". It's quite obvious which types of movies the authors like and which ones they don't. I enjoyed the backstories behind the films, but after a while I started skipping over the authors' harangues."
1,Not what I expected!,When I got the cd I was anxious to hear the old skool of Dazz Band. Unfortunately this cd is all live and the songs aren't very good live. I have to buy a different cd to hear the original versions.
3,Review of Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy,"I commend the author's attempt to provide a comprehensive review of pharmaceutical economics and policy in less than three hundred pages. This book is an interesting read and is accessible to those of us who are not economists. However, I would not recommend this book to others due to the facts that (1) the author is inconsistent in referencing the literature and (2) he often fails to present alternative interpretations of the empirical evidence. For example, the author uses evidence of price discrimination to demonstrate the ""importance of consumer demand"" in the pricing of pharmaceuticals and, by extension, the presence of competition in the pharmaceutical market (pgs. 103-105). However, he fails to point out that price discrimination by pharmaceutical companies reduces consumer surplus, a direct benefit of competitive markets. In addition, the book contains many typos that may prove distracting to some readers."
1,"Un volume complet, bien vulgarisé","Met beaucoup d'emphase sur le point de vue international versus les États-Unis, propos de macro économie biens présentés.Une seule lacune, les statistiques citées sont déjà bien obsolètes..."
5,Top Notch Camera,"It's simple. This is the best digital camera I've ever owned, with the best image quality that I have seen. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants 5MPs and the manual controls. As always, Canon has made another top-performing model. It was highly recommended at CNET, and has been a top product of 2003 in many magazines and camera-related websites. You can't go wrong with this camera. With the price just under 400 dollars, it's the best deal around! Make no mistake, Canon is the best at digital cameras! 10 stars if amazon had that!!"
2,With Canon you can't,I bought this 50% sale so I thought I made a good buy.. at least this is a 5mpix camera. This camera has two major drawbacks; Autofocus and Chromatic Aberrations. I take a lot of panorama and mosaic picture and even if one is out of focus it is all ruinded. Every fourth picture I take with autofocus is slighly or completely out of focus. Chomatic aberrations (purple or neon effect) appears on shiny surfaces and this is really annoying in high resolution images. This camera is good when it works but most of the times it does not. If you take more than 30 images a month I DO NOT recommend this!
5,Love this Camera,"I have not one complaint about this camera. This was my first digital camera. I have had it for 3 years now. It still works like brand new. I can take excellent quality pictures, quick download and even take great video that I have made all sorts of home videos using. I have never once had a problem with it and I use it almost 3-4 times a week taking several pictures or video at a time."
3,Good but not the Best,"Pros: 5MP, Autofocus, fast start, compact but many functions.Cons: redeyes, not easy to use for manual control, Lens door design kill this camera, i feel that it can come off at any point. heyyy and this is usb1.0i feel that if you want to just point and shot camera than get the canon s400 or casio z4, and if you want professional camera get the canon 300D or 10D, although i am still happy with it, but i feel like 350.00-450.00 is too much for this camera. it doesn't even come with case and what is 32mb compact flash? this is a 5megapix camera ...the reason i gave it 3 stars because the lens door, all around this camera is solid except the lens door. paying high price for a camera you will want a solid camera that can last for a long period of time. as for this canon s50 i'm afraid the door will come off one day."
4,the complete book of birdhouse construction.,"This book was ok. I bought it as a gift for my father. I was hoping it would have more birdhouse plans in it,( because of the title).It was still a good buy for the money . Thanks."
4,boost pod,"I had to do some trimming for my 2004 2500hd,but I knew this from reading the Diesel Fourm ,it turned out pretty good."
5,"Excellent, Very Emotional Book","I love this author! I read one of her earlier books but this one takes the cake. The story was very compelling and it felt REAL. Also, I loved that she brought back the ex, Carly, as a ghost to guide her surviving wife as she tries to move on with her life and find happiness. I cried at the end and I don't think I have done that in a long time. I also read the book in one sitting. Once you get into it, it is very hard to put down! Kudos!!"
1,Defective Typing Software,"This version (Version 12) has a flaw in it that will probably not allow you to advance from beginner to intermediate. This version is no longer supported by Broderbund (the software make). If you go to the Broderbund website, you will find a 'fix' for this version that does not work. By the time you pass from beginner to intermediate the warranty has expired. Broderbund is aware of this flaw but continues to sell the software. Don't buy it."
5,The Basketball Coaches Bible,A gift for my son who is a high school basketball coach. He has found the book very helpful. Good choice.
4,I could relate to this lady,"This is a book that many divorce/step families could relate with. I was amazed to see that a movie star had the same feelings as I do in regards to step children. I am not alone!! I admire Suzanne for describing her inappropriate outburst and her feeling guilty afterweres. I t was impressive that she was sharing with us information that would make her look awful. The book inspire me to read her first book, ""Keeping Secrets"". My Dad is an acoholic too and maybe I act a certain way because off that too, if Suzanne Somers does."
2,A game that promised but couldn't deliver,"This has to be one of the most dissapointing games I have ever played. With all of the features and the fact that it is the first first person shooter for the gba, it was a game to look foward to. To make a long review short this game SUCKS and I don't mean that lightly I mean it really really sucks, the graphics are good but the gameplay and level design definatly doesn't do the system or the engine justice. If you want a good first person shooter for your gba I suggest you wait for DOOM."
1,Flickering LCD and Blurry View Finder,"I read all the wonderful reviews and bought the Canon A70. However, when I finally received the camera yesterday, the LCD screen flickers and the viewfinder is blurry when at full zoom. What a disappointment...I have an older Canon A20 for business and have always liked it. The newer A70 is smaller with more features, but feels flimsy to me. The zooming mechanism is noisy and appears cheap. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a bad A70 that was damaged in shipping? I've decided to get another type of camera at a local camera shop this time."
4,A very good camera.,"A70 is a very good camera. Only problem I have had is that the button is so stiff, that each time I take a picture the camera shakes a bit (if I'm not very careful), which leads to a little soft (shaken) pictures.."
4,Happy user,"I've had this camera for about a month and I must say it has not dissapointed. If you are comparing costs though, I would include at least a couple of items you may find necessary. A set of rechargables and a higher capacity CF card. I have found the 3.2 MP number to be very acceptable even when printing larger formats. What this means is that when printing a full size 8.5X11 page, you'll get the same quality from this camera as a 5 Megapixel. The higher megapixels will only help if you are thinking of printing poster sizes. One thing I have not liked is the response time when taking pictures. If you really like to take action photos, this camera may not do the trick. When you snap a picture, you have to allow .5-1 sec for it to autofocus. I think you can get around this by disabling some of the auto-functions, but you need practice to get those shots right."
1,A Disposable Camera,After One year and 3 weeks of use the dreaded E18 error.Canon Customer Support is non-exsistant. And they act like they know nothing about this problem. Wanting to sell me a refurbished A75 as a replacement for $99.00 or fix it for $150.00.. NOT
4,Lots of great features make for digital fun,"This is my first digital so I'm no expert, but I've had nothing but trouble-free fun with this puppy since August. My wife and I took it on a cruise to Alaska and all our friends have complemented us on the pictures we took using the A70. The all-automatic setting makes pictures totally easy for the novice and the manual settings allow you to experiment. The user manual is pretty good at explaining basic operation and features and the free software helps you get your shots on your computer for editing and uploads.Only two complaints: the visual display is very hard to see in daylight (use the old fashion viewfinder) and be sure you get rechargeable batteries. That huge sucking sound you hear is the power draining out of your alkalines."
3,Poor Quality Control?,"My first A70 did a very nice job for a few weeks until it failed without warning. The camera simply died completely after writing two black ""photos"" to the memory card. Perhaps the replacement camera will work flawlessly for years to come. Canon can ill afford hundreds (or even dozens) of customers writing personal accounts of catastrophic failures of their products. In my opinion, this model can only maintain its classification as a good value if at least 99.9% of the units shipped remain failure-free for at least two years in the field."
1,Junky,"Generally very disappointing. It does have numerous little gadgets, but acts more of a toy than a real camera. Photo quality just isn't up to other digital cameras in the same price range. The ccd has serious problems reading images, as I say it is more of a toy than a camera, but fine for people who are not serious about photography."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY,"About a week after I purchased the camera BRAND NEW, the LCD screen went dark for no reason and went on and off with no pattern at all. I sent it in for repair (I had to pay for shipping) and they returned it two weeks later ""all fixed."" ONE DAY AFTER I received it back the LCD screen turned dark again and the whole problem came back, not to speak of the scratch on my camera from the repair process. I had a lot of respect for Canon products before this but now I am totally apalled by their poor quality."
1,My A70 died 12/25/2006,"I bought this camera after several relatives bought it and said great things. I thought the bright light pictures were good, but low light pics always blurred.I had some LCD trouble in November, but was able to turn on/off the camera and get some pictures from it. On Christmas Eve I took pictures without any of the previous trouble. On Christmas Day - trying to take pictures of my kids opening presents - my A70 DIED. No pictures for 2006!The camera was less than 3 years old. I've owned Canon cameras for over 20 years and this is the first time I've gotten a defective product from them. Looks like others are having same trouble.I don't recommend buying the Canon A70 camera. My aunt's camera died also."
1,Disappointed,"I chose this camera because it was highly rated and was supposed to be a good value, but it has not lived up to the hype. The resolution is WORSE than my old film camera - a very inexpensive point-and-shoot - and it is very frustrating to use for several reasons: 1) the shutter does not go when you push the button - there is a several second delay - not a big deal with inanimate objects, but very difficult to photgraph people without getting funny expressions, and nearly impossible to photograph the baby without a lot of trial and error; and 2) the flash takes a LONG time to recharge, so after getting a funny expression in your first photo due to the shutter delay, you have to wait and wait and wait to try again - trust me, this gets really, really, really annoying very quickly. I love the flexibility of having a digital camera, but we're going to have to spend more money to get another one that works better."
5,ACCESS IN LATVIA,This is the product I want to buy but my problem is that I am currently travelling in Latvia and need a camera as soon as possible. I will be spending a few days in Riga next week and want to know if it's possible to have the camera delivered to my hotel there.
2,E18 Error Message,"The camera has worked effectively for 1 year and 7 months.However it has now stopping working, and the message givenon the screen reads E18. Apparently this is common problemthat has to do with lens misalignment or something. Canon'scan fix it for 100 - 200, or replace it with a refurbishedmodel for 150. In any case this seems very frustrating forcamera to only function for about a year and a half.Another issue is that if you purchase the wide angle adapterlens it will not work with the flash. I believe this is a designflaw. The lens is so wide it blocks the flash, and creats acurved dark area on the images.One last issue is that the view screen cover is plastic orsomething and is very easily scratched. I also somehow gotdust or dirt underneath this screen which was under warrantyand was repaired.Otherwise its a pretty decent camera. Not a true pocket sizecamera. When its working it takes great pictures."
1,"Works great, when it works...","This is a wonderful device, when it actually works. Both the original and replacement unit we ordered had power issues. The unit would take between one and 12 or so measurements without problem, but then just shut off. The battery meter always showed full, and we used several brands of batteries, including the lithiums, always brand new, with no change in behavior. When the unit would shut down, all the internal memory would be cleared, so you'd have to go back and re-measure everything you hadn't written down. Support from Trimble is completely non-existent for these units -- no response to emails nor phone calls. Amazon replacement policy is very generous, and continue to buy from them. We plan to replace this with a Leica Disto."

1,poor product,I got two mugs from this company and they have both cracked down the side. This is the only thing That I have gotten from Amazon that I did not like.
3,Dictionary,"The voice was not clear,I have another on from the same company ,which has clear voice and very good pronoun-cation.I had contact the company to send it back,but I was told they would pay me only %70."
2,This is not a new book.... so confused,"This book was originally published in 1995 by Tor... 2 years after the release of Elvenbane. Is this a revision of some sort? I do agree that this book falls short of it's predecessor and the ending is VERY meek, almost leaving it open for a 3rd book."
4,"For crying out loud, where's the third book already?!?","I loved The Elvenbane. I really liked the stereotype-defying, ""evil, nasty elves"" concept. The characters (that mattered) were fairly well developed, and the plot, while a bit cliche, still kept me entertained. This book was good also. Not *as* good as the first one, but still good. I thought the story moved a bit too quickly-I finished the book in about a day. I've been waiting for the third book ever since since. The publishers have been lying about the release date of Elvenborn since 1995! I enjoyed the series and am still waiting for it to continue. Please TOR, make me happy!"
4,Beyond the ordinary recipes!,I just bought this book and I love the unusual and different ingredients suggested. Check out the Black Quinoa and Sweet Plantain Shrimp Salad. Sounds yummy and the presentation fun.
1,Not For Those On A Budget!!!,"Yea this is a great book with great recipes if you can afford the VERY EXPENSIVE cuts of meat and seafood these recipes call for. ALmost every other recipe called for Lobster! Lots of Shrimp (which is not THAT expensive) recipes too but a few called for Filet Mignon!! I suppose you could substitute them with Chicken/Beef or other seafoods, but I'm curious as to whom this book was intended for? I am assuming the very rich. If you want to spend Alot of money on a ""Fiesta"" party--(which i doubt most people do) then this book is for you but for those of us who are on a budget i would suggest looking elsewhere for more realstic Latin recipes."
1,Crazy Recipes,"This is not a simple book for someone who is looking to have fun latin Recipes at their party. These are more gourmet recipes. If you are lookinf for a funy idea for partys try "" Latin Chic"" the recipes are better and easier. If you are looking for ""gourmet latin"" this is for you."
5,A must for JNI users,"This is an excellent book! Liang provides short, illustrative, and useful examples as well as helpful tips for the JNI user. The presentation is extremely clear, with no fluff. This book is more informative than any existing material on JNI I know of. It offers a gentle introduction for the novice as well as technical depth for the expert. I particularly like the level of insight that only the designer and architect of the JNI can provide. My favorite programming technique is ""shared stubs,"" beats J/Direct."
2,only covers cursory overview of JNI,"Though I liked presentation of the book and how it explained concepts, the book only covers very cursory overview of the JNI and fails to show any complete realistic examples. And the most frustrating thing is that code given in the book fails to compile. I am overall disappointed at this book and waiting for Oreilly's JNI book."
5,Adjustable flower pot holder,"This is a GREAT product! My patio railing is an odd size and I had almost despaired of finding a flower pot holder that would fit. This is it! It fits and adjusted with no problems. My rail is almost 6 inches and that seems to be the maximum that these will accomodate, but certainly will adjust to a rail of smaller dimensions. It is unfortunate that a picture of the bracket is not available because that would show how they work, but nevertheless, they work and are GREAT!"
3,"Not gripping, not compelling","""The Bright Forever"" tells a tale of lives that are as underdeveloped, incomplete, sad and disconnected as the story itself. A disappointing read that did not fulfill its potential."
3,Good book- I expected it t be more thrilling--plot wasn't strong,"I didn't feel The Bright Forever had a very strong plot. The character, Henry Dees, is very interesting and I enjoyed all the parts with him. I feel it took forever to get to the actual breakdown of the book and then everything happend so quickly and rash decisions were made. I just feel like this could have been a lot stronger. It is ok though."
4,"Just ""Okay"" -- Well-written, but hardly suspenseful.","As a librarian in Indiana, the blurb on this one caught my attention. A kid returning library books in a small Indiana town goes missing?! Hmmmm! It was an OK read and I will likely recommend it to some of my library patrons. I didn't find myself caring too much about the characters, though. No one was particularly compelling to me."
4,Great broom,"This is a sturdy, fine bristle broom. I gets all the dust on my garage floor. It would get five stars if it were 10 bucks cheaper."
2,Very Disappointed,"Having researched this bass before I purchased it, I was sure I was going to be getting a quality acoustic bass. What I recieved was a pretty nasty bass with a lovely scrolled inlay in the neck. The ""A"" string has a significant buzz when plucked with out much force. I sent the bass back twice and there is still a problem. I had a local luthier look at it and try to adjust it. The buzz has somewhat disappeared, but the adjustment to the neck and bridge have turned this poor thing into a Bleeder. Definatley not what I wanted. For the same amount of money I walked out of GC with a new Takamine ""G"" series that sound and plays great. I'm kinda bummed cause I expected way more out of Michael Kelly."
1,"Wave Rally, ""Really?""","This game is very basic, much less that what I expected. In fact, it was an erroneous replacement for Splashdown (which I hear is pretty hot.) There are few too few tricks (that are difficult to execute) and the environment is lame -- it lacks a zoomed-out map, diversity/robustness."
3,MUCH better than nothing,"For those of us who live in the real world, and occasionally are forced to leave our pets in the car, these ventilators do help. They certainly don't keep the car cool, but I think there is a noticeable difference. I use two, and keep the opposite window open a bit too. I immediately ash-can the installation kit. What a pain, and you have to switch windows to follow the sun, anyway. It seems to work fine to have a half-inch gap in the window. Might be a worry about theft, but with 2 big dogs in the car, not a big deal for me. I like these units alot, and just bought 2 more. I had 2, and one got trashed. Now I will be trying 3 in my window at one time. I certainly wish the automakers would come up with a REAL solution for this problem. Or that we could take our dogs wherever we go. They certainly are better behaved than most people's kids."
5,Simply Outstanding,The author has written a book that has put in a simple context some of the more unusual theories about UFOs and the ancient gods of history. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
4,on fire...,"If you are looking to keep ur fire lit, this will encourage you and those around you. We as the body of Christ are responsible to share the gospel. Ever wonder why this world is at its worse? Do you see the end times comimg? Be encouraged, live a life for CHRIST. Let your light, so shine, be ""...a Contagious Christian""! YiC, kj"
1,Can't appreciate it...,"I love the country, I admire the people - that was the reason I thought of giving this book a try. Also, New York magazine made a glorified mention of the book. I was disappointed. Maybe because I am not Japanese - it leaves one with a feeling like after reading a Haiku. A feeling of total incomprehension. The stories are meant to be little personal tragedies, but the writing falls short of delivering it that way. The only touching story was the one about the prostitute (I think the story was called ""Piss"")."
4,Childhood Memories,"I can remember playing this game and others by the same company as a child and this was one of my favorites. Granted this game is a bit antiquated when compared to all the new software out there, but it helps children to learn and excel in problem solving."
2,Not for Delta Deltique 800s,"This kit may be for some Delta Single Handles but it is not for Delta Deltique 800 Single Handles. The Trim Kit's Sleeve, Bonnet and Handle do not fit. I was able to grind the Sleeve lip enough to make it work (we'll see about corrosion later). I then used the old Bonnet in that it is hidden and used the old, cleaned-up Handle. I also had to use the old Volume Knob (controls the flow)in that one is not supplied with this kit. I am now looking for something to take its place. It does look better than the corroded original so I will keep what I could fit."
1,golden trail,One of the poorest examples of Berton's works I have read. Very disappointing. If I had previewed it and gotten a sense of its scope.
1,Hard to Believe it Works,I bought this for my girlfriend who has a bunion. This was a last ditch effort to avoid surgery. What a waste-- did not relieve any pain and actually caused more. If this indeed works for others I would be highly surprised. I would be surprised if the reviews giving this thing 3-4 stars are genuine.
3,Pleased with purchase,"I bought this product because my bunion had begun to hurt me. I do not have a serious big toe deviation just yet but I do have the large lump on the side of my foot. I am 8 months pregnant and the added weight is bothering it. I bought this in hopes to relieve some pain.It does seem to adjust your toe. I can't wear it very long because it actually gets painful after awhile. When you put it on, you feel like you should really tighten it, but it doesn't need to be.Forget trying to walk with it on. It has absolutely no give. You have to walk with your foot completely flat as if it were in a cast, and even that is almost impossible.It is definitely ment to be worn at night or while relaxing since you are pretty immobile with it on.While I am sure it will not ""cure"" my bunion, I feel like over time it can help stretch the toe muscles and help with the pain."
4,Amazon came through with exellent customer service!,I recently purchased this set and when I received it it was entirely in broken into small glass pieces. Amazon paid for the return shipping and in less than a week shipped out a brand new set. Thanks!!!This is an excellent wedding gift for a new couple.
2,Beware: Description is not entirely accurate,"I had to return these--the product description says ""16-ounce soup bowl, 12-ounce mug"" which I thought would be a good size for my children. When the set arrived, I found that the mugs are 16-ounce size and the bowls held about 22 oz. That was just too big for the kids.Otherwise, the quality was about what you would expect for the price--some flaws, but nice enough for every-day use."
5,DVN's CD is full of humor and fun & great music in general,"Da Vinci's Notebook are a great acapella group out of Northern VA, and their CD is full of humor and fun and great music in general...the covers are refreshing takes on the originals (""Metal Shop"" is outstanding, as well as They Might be Giants' ""Shoehorn with Teeth"" with the wonderful Moxy Früvous as guest players) and the original songs (most notably ""Liposuction"") Check them out...either live or just by getting the ceedee, and you won't be disappointed :-)"
2,Lumbar Roll,This lumbar roll is not what I have had in the past and I would not recommend it. Buy The Original Mckenzie Lumbar Roll instead.
2,Way too big,This rolls seems way to big for any kind of support. It prevents you from being able to have support for other areas of your back. It is also quite stiff.
1,Overpriced,"Don't waste your money buying this CD. You get the EXACT same tracks on the Samurai Champloo, Vol 2 CD which is at a much better price. In fact, you get double the tracks. Don't bother importing this CD unless you just feel like looking at the cover art for some reason. lol You can find the Samurai Champloo, Vol 2 CD here on Amazon."
1,HEY PETER CULLEN ! WHERE ARE YOU ?,"This second release of an articulately-detailed G1 Optimus Prime is third rate. It appears to be using the same mold as the almost all-metal version that came out a couple of years ago, HOWEVER, this new model is more plastic than metal. My biggest gripe about this item is the statement on the box that says ""Real Movie Sounds"". That awful base that comes with this toy, which supposedly has lights and sounds from the Animated Motion Picture (1986), does not have actual dialogue from the movie. Peter Cullen's portrayal of the ORIGINAL PRIME is not heard in this base. The only authentic sounds coming from the base are the original 'transforming' sound effects from the G1 shows and the animated movie. Basically, I wouldn't buy this item if it were FREE. Does HASBRO think the buying public is ignorant of the fact that the voice is not the original Prime? I personally feel insulted by this product."
2,Too small,These chairs look very nice but they are uncomfortable since they are not deep enough. No thigh support at all.
3,was,satisfied with this but thats about all! there isn't much else I can say about this CD draw your own conclusions
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I enjoy Michael Johnson's music. I have seen him perform live and always anticipate his music on the radio. I ordered ""Then and Now"" through Amazon because his music is so diffcult to find in any music store. Two songs on the CD,""This Night Won't Last Forever"" and ""Bluer Than Blue"" are not the versions I have ever heard on the radio. They are more vocal than musical and left me disappointed with my purchase."
1,&#65533;Wow that was off. Way off.&#65533;,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter has been using Disney's Preschool software for about a month without a problem. After two session on this software she found the activities to be too easy, the only difficultly being mouse speed. She has asked to go back to Pooh.The games are not intuitive and there is a lot of verbal instruction. There are also several logic flaws, such as arranging items for a picture and then the picture taken has nothing to do with the arrangement. In the phonics section, if you select the wrong letter the character actually says, ""Wow, that was off. Way off.""I think the whole reward system is too complicated and takes you away from doing the activities. Disney has the same issue, just less so. Software makers should focus on fun educational activities and not on long story lines or rewards."
4,Good investment,"My son is 2 1/2 and loves his Jump Start software. He asks to play every day! Good distraction from TV and another avenue for parent child interaction. Right now it is hard for him to manuver the mouse to the various objects in the activities, but with help he's learning to move the mouse and how to play the interactive games. There are several activities on each CD, but he does have his favorites (i.e. balloon animals). Overall a great teaching/learning tool. Each CD allows the parent to increase or decrease the activity challenge level, so it will grow with him for the next few years!"
2,Not as good as i expected---dont waste your money,"I bought this for my 3yo daughter because i was impressed with the other jump start programs. I was very dispointed. She likes the older program--it has more activitys and teaches so much more. And it was only 9 bucks, compared to the $29 dollars i shelled out on this program. It comes with 3 cds-she only uses one. Disk 1 preschool fundamentals is great, but does not have many activities. As for the other ones- i cant install the language program on my CPU.(many other people have the same problem)and the art disk is a waste."
1,Modern????,I find it hard to believe that Amazon would recommend this boo to me. Modern Winemaking was written in 1985!! That means it is based on winemaking over thirty years ago. What I was expecting to learn about developments in the last 30 years not what was modern in the 1970's. I was very disappointed.
3,International version nothing great,"The ""international"" version is nothing more than the American release vocals with an Indian-flavored background band used in place of the rock or country musicians used on the ""red"" and ""green"" versions, respectively. Maybe Sade's songs could be ""massaged"" with this style to create interesting versions of a CD's worth of tunes, but the result on UP sounds goofy and hard to listen to... like you've hired Ravi Shankar to play lead guitar for the Rolling Stones. If this version of Shania's album ever became popular ANYWHERE, I would be really surprised. Stick to the red or green versions of this CD."
4,Ectaco Enlgish -Russian dictionary,"The device is nice and useful, but the voice and pronunciation is not clear enough"
1,Do Not Buy This Facsimile Edition,"Prentice Hall has made a major error in judgment allowing this book to be made available in facsimile (copied) format, especially at the price they are charging. The subtle details of image processing techniques are, in most cases, masked by the poor copy quality. Unfortunately, many college courses are requiring this book and no original hardbound copies seem to be available. If you are only interested in theory, this is a good book. If you are looking for image quality samples, look somewhere else."
4,It Ain't Nothing Wrong With A Big Woman,"Me being a big woman myself I loved this CD. I say keep up the good work for our image. Because truely there is nothing wrong with us, if anything we get all the glory for being ourselves. We're Big Beautiful and know how to have fun and fun to be around. You say party and we know how. Lots of love for this artist."
4,The real story of Northern New England,A story of the real Northern New England and the people who lived there. When men were men and the rivers ran wild. A story of when lumber was king and a man's word was as good as gold.
3,Disapponting service from Wenger,"The Watch seems very good, and in fact was good to use for a while -- however within 6 months the spring action on the hinge failed, and despite wenger NA still claiming in the watch details that it is possible to get a braille manual -- they have informed me that this is actually not possible.When I contacted the manufacturer via the information included with the watch I was told to ship the watch to canada for repairs -- I have now shipped my watch to canada to have repairs done -- but they -- after receiving my watch -- now have doubts about their ability to repair it -- or even to ship it back.On the whole it has been a bad experience"
3,Oh please!,This woman is my ex step mother from years ago. Seriously she was a good palm reader back then but to give advice in her other books on relationships cracks me up. Her and my father fought like cats and dogs and she was the most demanding woman I ever met. However people change and I will give her the benefit of the doubt.... maybe.
3,mixed feelings,"Great production, lots to look at. A visual experience thin on substance. If you're into the fine art of design you will enjoy it. Think of it as a coffee table book with little commercial relevance."
3,Havahart battery powered repellent,"We live next to a National Park and often get deer in the area. The major perk of this product is the sprayer, it is convenient to use. I did notice less deer after using the product, but it did not deter all of them...so it's hard to judge whether it was just a time where we had less deer coming or the product actually worked. Because I live in an area that sees rain often, it is not cost-effective for me to use the product long term unless there is a future drop in price."
2,Squirrels love it!,"Wish I could say this was a good investment, but it lasted two days before the creatures came back and I saw them digging in my garden. The Deer off may be Dear Off but not Squrriel Off."
3,"works, but rain is a problem","I sprayed this on my roses for the first time about 3 weeks ago, as deer were eating my poor roses to nubs! I have mixed results.Pros:1) it did seem to work- for about 2 weeks, the deer left my roses completely alone, and they were able to flourishCons:1)I was never able to adjust the sprayer very well, and was unable to get a fine mist- just a straight out spray, which made for difficulty in covering the plants without saturating them.2) it says to reapply ever 2-3 months, or after heavy rain. It has only been 2 weeks and the deer are back. However, I live in Oregon, and it rains a lot here! It is possible that in a dryer climate, this would work better/longer. But if you live in a climate with lots of precipitation, you will have to use gallons of this to last the summer."
1,Pellet gun would be a better option.,"I purchased this as it said that it would help repel squirrels. After applying it all over the tree branches/fruit that hang over the patio that these pest sit, eat, drop fruit, defecate and urinate over (making our patio most undesirable to be around)it had absolutely no effect on repelling them. So unfortunately this item is totally useless on repelling the squirrels in our neighborhood = 1 star because there is a zero star option."
4,Not good against starving or rabid animals,"The battery-operated Havahart DO64MS Deer Off sprayer seems useful for those with weak hands, but at an additional cost of replacement batteries. This gentle and all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor groundhogs, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks and other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid. This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use. Its oil of black pepper, peperine and capsaicin are not offensive to people and applicable not only gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also in basements, cellars, and storage."
2,Useless,"Just like other animal repellants (and I've tried many), the Havahart repellant (Havahart also make traps) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy, so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products. In fact, you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective: repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables. Deer, squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged."
3,Small bottle,"This is about the only product that we've found that'll keep the deer and rabbits from eating everything. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this bottle is half the size of the one I usually buy....so it's not such a good deal. I could've bought it cheaper at my local Lowes store. I won't purchase this product again on-line."
1,So far not so Good,I used this product for the first time 4 days ago. I like the battery powered spray handle. It is easier to use than a squeeze spray and delivers a nice fine mist.So far I have not had any deer eat flowers and Hosta. This is especially noteworthy since there is a numerous deer population that is not afraid of humans. They literally stare at you from 25 feet away when I leave my house.There is a lot less odor with this product than with others I have used. I hope to update as the growing season progresses.UPDATE: The Deer must have aquired a taste for this product because they have devoured all Hosta and many flowers.
3,will need to reapply frequently,"We have had rain several times in the 10 days since I applied it, and now the tips of my little trees are being eaten again. Looks like I will have to reapply weekly.I also think the battery powered sprayer is more trouble than it's worth. Glad they supplied the batteries. When these wear out, I will try to put a manual sprayer on it. The nozzle of the sprayer also does not adjust well, like it is cheaply make or something."
3,Good product - questionable deliver system,"The repellent works and doesn't smell as bad as some. Actually, it has very little odor. That's good. I wonder if the powered sprayer is adding extra cost without offering much benefit. Unless you have very weak hands, it offers little advantage over a conventional garden sprayer or spray bottle. It also aerosolizes the repellent, which makes it float away on any kind of breeze at all.That makes it necessary to use more product than a conventional sprayer, expensive product per ounce. Since we live in a windy place that's not a good thing. The sprayer we got also didn't work the way it was installed and required fiddling with to get it functioning. I'd get Deer Off again but not with the sprayer."
3,Deer Off,"I have not had to use it too much, so I really can't give it a good rating. I mainly wanted it to keep the squirrels away."
3,Seems to work,"Rabbits are hard to keep away, and nothing short of electrocution (which I don't intend to try) works all the time. This seems to do the job of causing them to avoid the sprayed area, but of course it wears off over time. I'm not sure how long that time is, though, since I only recognized it had stopped being effective when I noticed the rabbits were back. Bottom line: worth trying."
2,I wish it were better,"The repellent works well -- until the first rain.The accompanying sprayer worked for about 6 seconds, then became clogged. As did the pump sprayer I tried, although it did last for a few minutes.It's a shame the repellant can't be made to last longer, and that it can't be made to be more clog-free.Non-the-less, I'll probably order it again, until I can find something better and more reliable."
1,one hundred used for a penny,"People are writing great reviews so they can get rid of their copy. Mine is going in the trash it is so bad. Ill-thought out and bumbling talk. Seek Brian Tracy, Tony Robbins, Dale Carnegie, Napolean Hill, etc."
3,Wave race game,"My son thinks this is a fun game and has played it several times. Dad has trouble steering and getting the hang of it. I think for those with experience with these types of games, it is worth it. Probably not for older novices."
3,this game sucks,"Ok, first off, this game sucks, reason why is because the controls are so touchy it just takes the fun out of the game when you finally get first place and then go around a bouie with out trying to hit the wall, and just completly turn around all in all, i gave the game 3 stars becuase of the graphics, the grahics are awesome. if your the kind of person who likes taking 8 monhths to learn the controls then this game is probably for you."
3,"If you haven't played this game, u don't need to review it","This game is really annoying. You have to go around these hoops and that is one of the worst part about this. If any of you haven't reaserched or played this game, you shouldn't have wrote a review because you don't know anythin about this game"
3,UUH u morons k,"This game is sooo anoying for a lot of diffrent reasons. First, in order to lose you have to go around these things. If you go around them for 5 times without going around them. This game is very weird. THe graphics aren't that good. Let me comment that you people who haven't reasearched about this game OR have played it are jerks. Why should you write a review if you haven't reasearched it or if your freind told you. You people are jerks who do that."
3,Yeah! Funny!,"Funny!! I like it, but before you buy it, rent it! the first 3 weeks the game was soo good but then it turned a little boring... still good game! Proximo q venha"
4,Good camera with one major shortcoming,"This is a pretty decent camera. BUT one thing you REALLY need to get is a spare battery. Why? You never know when you're going to lose the juice! It gives you about two picture warning before it goes dead. I consider this to be a MAJOR design flaw. Soooo, heed my warning and get a spare battery for this one. You can get good alternative to OEM batteries on eBay for 3-bucks!"
1,Memory card error - Card locked,"I just got my SD200 camera 2 days ago. Took pictures, viewed them, and then the battery died. When the battery recharged and I tried to view the pictures again the next day, when I turned the camera on, it said ""Memory card error"" and it occassionally said ""Memory card error Card locked"". I first thought there was something wrong with my memory card, but then I looked it up online and all these Amazon reviews came up that it's their Canon, not the memory card. Fortunately, the pictures I took were still on the memory card when I brought them to a photo store and they were able to burn them onto a cd for me. I'm really not sure what to do now..."
1,Epidemic of E18 errors shortly after warranty,"Avoid this camera at all costs. Mine failed only shortly out of warranty with an E18 error. Search the net for ""canon e18 error"" and you will see hundreds of similar problems. A little research seems to indicate that the MTBF (mean time between failures) is about 16-18 months on this and several other Canon models. A high percentage of cameras are failing. I see no signs that Canon has any intention of doing the right thing, all they will do is try to charge you more to repair it than the camera is worth.While it works it's a good camera and takes decent pics, but this price for a camera that becomes a useless hunk of metal at 18 months is truly unacceptable."
2,cannon powershot sd400,"packaged well, fully documented,one dent on lense bezel, no sim card, non-functioning battery. Haven't been able yet to check operation until recieve battery and sim card."
1,Great while it lasted,"After 18 months, memory card error. I tried various remedies: new battery, different cards, reformatting via card reader to FAT, resetting camera defaults. Reformatting worked a few times the past 6 months. Now, it's been a full two years and it's a svelt silver brick. Please fix it Canon!"
2,"Great Camera, Lackluster Product","As a camera, my Canon S400 delivered on everything it promised: wonderful photo quality, great ease of use, and extreme portability -- the size is just right.However, as a product, the Canon S400 suffers from lackluster reliability and product integrity. After 6 months of use, my S400 gave up the ghost in the middle of a family holiday, leaving me with the dreaded Canon ""E18"" failure warning. So, no more picture taking, no way to get my photos out. I've had to send my camera back to Canon for repair. All of this for a camera that I babied, packed carefully, and always carried in a case.Now, I don't know if the S400 is any less reliable than any other brand of digital camera, but I do know that it let me down in a big way that is going to cost me big $$$. A simple web search on the phrase ""Canon E18"" will show you that many other individuals have experienced similar problems."
1,Memory Card error,"Well... It is getting boring, but we too are the victim of the Memory Card error. After barely 1.5 years of use! I am really disappointed in Canon. So unless you want to buy a new camera within 2 years time, don't buy this one. Just see the number of people who had this problem and be amazed..."
4,Canon S400 4MP used,"Product arrived on time, looked very good for a used item. All the manuals and cables, etc. were included. It did ship in an A430 box and the documentation was for the A430 as well but it was not hard to adapt it for the S400. Only 1 complaint. The battery was n/g, it wouldn't hold a charge. I ordered a 2 pack of replacements for $8 and everything should be fine once they arrive."
1,"It was great for 2 years, but then... MEMORY CARD ERROR!!","If you want your digital camera to last you for more than 18 months, then don't buy this one! It erased all of my valuable pictures too!Thank you so much C. Gallo for telling us about the ""memory card error"" fix. It worked like a charm! I had to take out all ten screws though to get it to come apart, but I was careful to mark which screw came from which place and I got it back together with only one scratch (I stupidly tried to use a knife to jar it open after I removed the first 5 screws).Good news: I am so grateful that I dont have to rush out and buy a new camera just yet.Bad news: I lost all of my vacation pictures when this first happened. How long can I expect my camera to go before this happens again?Thank you!Cindy"
1,Failed in first three weeks !,"Bought a S400 3 weeks ago. Battery eject functioned poorly at outset. Filled a 256 mb card to try it out and then took it to the Galapagos Islands. After one day the camera gave an error message, would replay shots already taken but when switched to camera gave only a meesage saying contact Cannon and promptly shut itself off. I replaced a 2 megapixal powershot with the S430 but the build quality of this unit is inferior to my prior powershot."
4,price went down??? OMG,OMG! i just got this cam a week ago...less than a week ago and the price is lower now????? That is soo jacked up! I like the cam and all but I shoulda waited...The price went down 1 day after i ordered this cam! So NOT Fair..For those who wanna get this cam just wait a while til the price goes down. Ur gunna regret it like I did! I paid 399.99 just a week ago!! =/ Disappointed at that..that is why I gave only 4 stars instead of 5. Its a great little cam. Pictures come out greater than I thought. This is my first digital cam but when I compare to my friends digi cams its soo much clearer. dunno how the battery lasts. That is one bad thing! It doesn't tell you how much battery power is left!
1,Memory Card Error,"I've owned this camera for 2 years now, back then it was $370. After about 1 1/2yrs it started giving me a memory card error on the screen. I thought it was my CF card and luckily I work for a computer parts manufacturer, took it into work and had tech support look at it. They RMA'd the CF card and gave me a new one but found nothing wrong with it. After googling the error I found many sites of many users' complaints of the same issue.I tried to make it work, found a trick where if I took out the CF card and battery and put back in it would solve the problem sometimes. But the error got more and more frequent and now it's just sitting collecting dust. $370 down the drain! I throught it would take me further than 2 years. Tried to contact Canon about the issue, they don't do anything for you.Now that the prices of digcams have dropped so much I'm looking into buyin another one since I have a lemon on my hands, but I'm staying away from CANAON!"
1,What a disappointment!,The first couple of years were great. But then I had the MEMORY CARD ERROR of death and was shocked to find out that it's the norm for it to disfunction after 18 months. I paid $500 for this camera so it was an expensive mistake. You can do MUCH better.
1,Me too on the memory card error,"I liked this camera pretty well when it worked. The user interface wasn't as easy to use as my old Sony, but it was a nice camera.Until I got the dreaded memory card error and now it's a door stop, out of warranty. It still works, but who wants a camera that only works 95% of the time, and then 5% of the time dies with a memory card error until you can go home and clear out the memory card? Makes it basically useless."
2,Poor Quality,Works okay when it works. Fell apart quickly. There are better vibrating rings out there.
5,Fun Product,This is a great product for anyone who wants to build something and feel feminine at the same time. Good quality and weight. Gets the job done and matches well with pink tool pouch and pink safety glasses.
3,Not Tailored for Mac Users,This book has been a bit of a disappointment since all of the screen shots and commands are from the Microsoft Windows version of Quicken. I have discovered several features and commands that are not included in the Mac software that I own. Hopefully Quicken will correct this deficiency in future editions.
5,Support Arizona Cap,Thanks Amazon.com. I got this cap to show my support for Arizona who is facing a terrible illegal alien immigration problem that our Federal government is doing nothing about.
4,Lots of nice patterns to choose from,"I thought this book was for use with the ""On the Double"" double ended crochet hooks created by Annie's Attic but it is not. This is merely a book of really nice afghan patterns using DOUBLE THREAD. This book was originally published in 1996 - way before Annie's came up with the double ended crochet hook idea. So it was not what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised by how many really nice patterns were in the book - ones that I would consider making. The directions seem clear and its a big book. I'm happy!"
1,sickening bubblegum,"First of all, I don't understand how you can release a greatest hits album, when you've only had TWO other albums! This music is pure bubblegum and I don't understand how anyone could waste their money on it. And to top it all off, Hilary's voice is as weak as wet paper towel. She sound sort of like a whining mouse."
1,HORRIBLE LIVE SINGER,"Did anyone else catch the American Music Awards on 11/22/05? I don't know who was worse, Hilary Duff ""singing"" Beat of My Heart or Lindsay Lohan ""singing"" Confessions of a broken heart"". I dont think either girl can sing really. Lindsay has one up on Hilary for her acting career. Far more top selling movies than Hilary. But Hilary has better record sales. But my god, the Beat of My Heart performance on the AMA's was HORRIBLE. THe lyrics were the most simple lyrics I have ever heard in my life. It's like she jsut repeated the same thing over and over and over. And what is up with her teeth? Did she go crazy with the Davinci Veneers? Come On??!?!?!? Hoorible, song, horrible performance, but that is all I'm rating. Her album before last, with that Rain song was catchy."
1,Rubbish,"""Wake up"" is the greatest crap in this year. A kid can write a better lyric instead of writing ""London. Paris, even Tokyo"". It's time for u guys to wake up. Stop buying her cd's."
3,It's not THAT bad...,"Hilary Duff became famous entirely ""too"" quickly for her own good. She scored a television touchdown with her short lived (two year) series, ""Lizzie McGuire"", then moved on.Hilary's a decent actress, and sure, her only audience should be the shower head, but her music is just sugar-pop fluff. It's not totally horrible.Plus, we all used to LIKE her music before we heard the songs a million times. So, if you're giving this a bad review, then you're quite obviously a post-partum superstarlet Hilary fan."
1,Guilty of making trash,"this is horrible, her latest single beat of my heart could make a healthy pig die immediately."
1,"Holy Jesus Mary and Joseph, Batman!","My Giggly Gosh, this record is so original and creative. Obviously, Hilary Duff put a lot of time into writing all of these songs. You can really hear her put her soul into her music-she just seems so real and un-plastic to me, that it sends shivers all down my spine. I mean, this just kicks bands like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Mars Volta to the curb!! I'm so glad that Hilary Duff was born-and get this, now she's going punk! And let me tell you guys, she is really turning the punk scene upside down. Goodbye, Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Black Flag, for here comes the most punkiest girl in town! She just embraces the whole punk ideal of rebellion and non-conformism-I mean look at her style of fashion! (little girl voice) Hahahaha, LOL, OMG, ROFL, Hahahahahahahaha, so like, see you later, LOL!!! Hahahahahahahahaha!!!!"
1,Wish there was a zero stars option.,"Hilary Duff is so annoying wish she wood die I hate her beats hate her whole cd wish she would stop singing and I wish she'd stop acting she makes me sick so much I just hate all her songs her remixes are so stupid want her to go home.(Hey, I used NO PUNCTUATION! Just like all the other morons that review stuff on Amazon. Ha ha ha.....)"
2,What is she thinking!?!?,This cd is horrible.Too soon for a greatest hits collection.Too many repeats.Don't waste your money on this cd!!!!!
1,Music is Dead,"I'm not a kid I'm 17 and hear my sister listen to this crap all the time. Don't waste your time with this crap, you kids wanna listen to punk then buy the misfits box set not the hilary duff album, music is dead, hilary duff is wasting away physically and isnt even attractive anymore... so as a summary she's ugly, she makes terrible music, she's stupid and has an annoying face sounds lika a good record to me. Go get a real kick ass album like Shout At The Devil, or Appetite for Destruction... but in the name of all that is evil please Hilary Duff and hilaryduff fans stop using the devil horns or i'll eat your families."
4,Other stuff to check out,I am a huge fan of catchy melodic girl rock/pop. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) Jalopy Go Far by Zolof The Rock and Roll Destroyer2) Ready 2 Pop by Miss Mary3) An Illustrated History by Puffyamiyumi
1,This album sucks!!!,"In my life, I wouldn't have known an artist that doesn't have talent until I met Hilary Duff. This album is the confirmation of my hypothesis: She's PLASTIC!!! That's the truth because this CD really succks: it only has 3 or 4 new songs and the rest of the album are pure remixes and old songs. That's why she doesn't sell too many album. So Hilary, You'd better be an actress, please!!!"
3,Most Wanted,"I certainly have mixed feelings about Hilary Duff. Her metamorphosis album was awesome....it was actually HER. but the ""hilary duff"" album sounded like she was depressed and she asked someone else to write all the songs for her. The Most Wanted album is mostly old songs with a different beat with 3 new songs. i dont like wake up very much because it's like she was bored one day and wrote that song. beat of my heart is kinda repetitive, but its pretty good. and break my heart is pretty good too. I am quite amazed. Hilary Duff is only 18, and yet she has released 3 albums, and has millions of fans. i used to ADORE her, but after her Hilary Duff album, she wasnt my favourite singer anymore. So now, in conclusion, i say that Hilary Duff is a good singer, but she isnt perfect."
1,how did this girl get a recording contract?,"she should have just retired after being lizzy mcguire. She looks like an old woman too. She's not even 20 and even my 50 year old mother looks much younger than her. She can't sing or anything, it's almost like she bought her fame which keeps true talents out there from getting discovered. Oh well talents like mariah carey, madonna, mary j blige, ne yo, kanye west have been ruling the charts for the past year or so which is good cause everyone seems to have forgotten about hilary"
1,I'm Ready to Wake Up Now,"I just had this horrible nightmare that my favorite singer Hilary Duff released a ""greatest hits"" album with 3 pretty crappy new songs and ""remixes"" that are mostly just really bad beats looped over the originals(or worst). Now I'll be the first to admit that Hilary Duff is a great singer(maybe the best) but I can't think of a bigger letdown than seeing this disc for the first(and hopefully last)time. From the lame cover to the ""club"" ""remixes"" you'll have to hold your nose as the stench of mass marketing overwhelms your sinuses."
1,haha...shes stupid and its funny!,"ok first of all i just wanna say NO i do NOT own this cd, i never will own this cd, and i will never THINK about wasting my money on this cd. now that we got that out of the way...i was reading a review for this because i think its funny to hear people make this shiznick sound good and the person said that she had a ""rock edge"" because of her new boyfriend joel ... hahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahhaha!!!!!! whoever wrote that review is HILARIOUS! god! funniest joke i have ever heard in my life! i've also heard there are only THREE new songs on this cd...i have no idea how she got away with that but...suredont buy it...trust me all of those songs will eventually be way overplayed on the radio and we can all ""enjoy"" them then...i cant wait *gags*"
3,I am a huge Lindsay Lohan fan but Hilary is cool too!!,I liked Hilary on Lizzie McGuire and Casper meets Wendy. I bought the album metamorphosis and it was'nt too bad. Then she made the self titled one and did'nt like it much. I just bought her new one and its pretty cool with the remixes. Her song Wake up is great but she looks weird in the video. Her teeth are BIG and she looks a little skinny. I ilke the thick Hillary better and her movies are ok too. except The Lizzie McGuire movie and Raise your voice. I'm not one of those Haters like her song..lol
1,ARGH! Avoid!,"I think that it's crazy with awful music quality like this! She is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is that you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the overly commercialized pop untalented albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years?Oh, and I'm not a hater. Hilary is just untalented."
1,Worst Album Ever,This sucks. Hilary's voice is high-pitched and annoying and she doesn't write her songs or play instruments. Get this CD if you are seven years old (or your IQ is seven).
1,EW,"Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan are the worst singers evers. that is what these two enemies have in common, bad singing voices. Hilary duff is all ""punk"" but she is just trying too hard. her voice is nasily and even I can sing beter than her. It's true that anyone can be famous, proof: Hilary Duff"
5,"Hal, Margaret and the Med","I'm a fan of Hal and Margaret Roth's books. Their books let me vicariously travel with them and as a history geek too, this book ties two interests together. Now, I will admit that I'm not a big Homer fan -- Rome being more my time period and interest, but so what -- this book was an interesting read and being able to read a modern description of the paces that Odysseus was supposed to have visited along with PHOTOS of this is great.I wish it were longer and they had covered some more of the Med, but so what -- good read!"
4,Good for the price,"Pros: kids like the scanning stickers and play money. they like the microphone too. Overall, a sturdy and easy to use product. Cons: VERY MINOR--stickers don't want to stay where you put them. We saved boxes and cans from our kitchen. Had to put clear tape over them to stick, but then we were fine. Then, we were good to go!"
2,Some features do not function,"Upon arrival, the microphone and scanner feature on the Zillion Talking Cash Register did not function. Very disappointing. Returned this product."
1,WORSE purchase ever,"We havent even had this a week and I already HATE it!! The drawer never wants to open...its a task to get it to open, when it should just open with the push of a button. So my son is constantly bringing it to me to open the drawer and I have to sit and push the button over and over and pull the drawer. We already had to replace the batteries because they stopped working already!! Total waste of money!"
1,Defective right out of the box,"We received the Zillionz Talking Cash Register today, and it was defective right out of the box. The drawer would not open at all, no matter what we tried. There were no coins or bills included, despite that fact that they are in the product description. The scanner barely worked. We are returning this item immediately, and we will not be ordering another one."
4,Just what i was looking for,Our 4 yr old granddaughter loves to play store. The microphone really works & is a big favorite. The scanner works and she must scan everything as she is selling us all her toys. I would recommend this cash register. Much more learning as she gets older. Very sturdy.
3,Satisfactory,"Overall, this product works fairly well. We do have some problems getting the scanner to pick up the barcodes, and the barcodes don't stick to real food packages all that well. But it comes with ample bills and coins, and my son likes the credit card feature and the sound effects with the register opening. We use this to play ""grocery store"", so it would have been nice if the barcodes didn't ""ring up"" such large numbers, like $50-$75-$100-$200."
1,Waste of money,"I was super excited to order this cash register for my two children ages 4 and 5, however, I was quickly disappointed when I realized I had received a piece of junk. The first cash register never turned off so the batteries died after about 3 days of playing with it, maybe a total of 20 minutes. I returned it to Amazon (wonderful customer service) and they sent me another one very quickly, only to learn that the second one was the same way. Now we have a cash register (second one) with no sound. This would typically be fine with me except that I paid $30 for this toy expecting a quality toy that would help my children learn about money, number recognition, etc. I normally do not read reviews before buying a toy, but please heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS TOY unless you are ok with it not working properly and are prepared to have very disappointed children (AND parents!)."
1,Was broken when we received it.,The change drawer was broken when we received it and would not open. Not worth the $$ spent on it.
5,"Important work, now more than ever","During the Clinton years, the foundation of American foreign policy seemed to be that economic growth was a natural phenomenon and that America needed only help other nations 'liberate' their markets. We did not take seriously enough the idea that economic growth is rooted in particular cultural norms, and that 'liberalization' without those norms would frequently lead to nothing but chaos and deep-seated anti-American resentment.There is no justification for the attacks of September 11th, but one could argue that, under Clinton, America did not do enough to demonstrate that we stand for political as well as economic reform. This book, which I have read in manuscript form, is an important intellectual rebuttal to ideas that have tarnished America's name abroad."
3,Fun for a while,Fun for a while then it gets boring doing the same old thing over and over. At least the graphics are good
3,"It is fun, but not enough for a regular gamer.","It is a great game. The graphic is great, the animation is awesome, the music and soundFX is very naturalistic, and the level environments are convincing. However, there are only total of four levels, and once you start playing Pikmin you won't believe how easy it is. They should have advance the game into more player options, such as multiplayer (even online!) to go against your opponents. A level design would be a good idea too, to challenge your opponents in passing your designed environment.But none of this is available in the game. The game is great, but not overwhelming great. Moreover, I am looking forward to the Pikmin 2 (if there is one).If you want to play Pikmin, I suggest you to rent it instead of buying it. I guaranteed you are able to finish it less than a week."
4,Pikmin,"Pikmin is fun. The story is kind of, uh, pointless, but it's fun. The only down side is the entire third level. It's so big that it takes 2 minutes to get from point A to point B.Then you have to come all the way back to point A because you brought the wrong color Pikmin or not enough. That level is dark too which makes it harder. Overall, It's a great game, though. If you like a challenge, this is definitely your game."
4,PIKMIN: 10 fingers up,"When I first bought Pikmin I thought it was going to be a pre-school type game, but when I started to play Pikmin, I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY. This game was sooooooo cool. It was like controling my own army. This game packs 2 of the best qualities for games; strategies, and just deminating and destroying a world that you don't even care about.BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT REGRATE IT. IT WAS THE BIGGEST SUPPRISE I HAVE EXPERENCED IN GAMING."
1,Why do you want this game?,"i rented this game and i loved it....for about 10 minutes. all it is is fight, plant pikimin ,pick pikmin ,fight ,grow pikmin, pick pikmin,etc.Dont get this game it is so boring. Ask yourself why am i playing this game? before you buy it!!!"
5,Reason enough,"Our family owns four different game consoles, including the Cube and the Box. Overall, I was disappointed with the relatively poor selection of games for the Gamecube, but Pikmin alone has made the purchase worthwhile. The skills one can learn here are amazing: The player controls up to a hundred creatures (management) and get them to work as a team to build the spaceship (teambuilding, goalsetting, delegation) back to shipshape. In the process you have to send the creatures into harm's way. You have enough emotional attachment so that losing the creatures is upsetting, much like in real life. I love this game, and Pikmin2 is just as great of a story, with better control. Awesome games, I recommend both. As mentioned, these two games are reason enough to own a gamecube."
1,Stinker,"We all know that this series should have died ages ago, but the ignorant folks at Nintendo seem to have forgotten that. This game is repetive beyond belief. You will most likely find yourself dozing off while playing just as I did. You'd be better off saving your money for Super Monkey Balls."
5,Must buy,This game is so much fun to play. There is no game like it and you have to try it. Played again and again many times.
3,Now for something completely different...,"Pikmin definately gets points for originality. I can't think of any other games about a stranded astronaut that has to rely on plant creatures he picks out of the ground to help him rebuild his space ship. I liked the concept, and the fact that the player has to use creativity and strategy to be able to win. Make the wrong moves, or take too much time, and you fail. Graphics are good, not the best I've seen on Gamecube though. I also found the game too short. Just as I was getting into it, it was over. Worth play for the sheer originality."
2,PIKMIN FUN AT FIRST,I got Pikmin at Christmas it was fun at first then got very boring u did the same thing everday the days were 2 short and u didnt have enough time 2 to get all the parts i beat the game in a week it was 2 short and i wasnt very impressed with it so i suggest dont waste your time with this game its not worth it.
4,Good,"They work. I wouldn't say they are the best, high quality cables ever made but they did what I wanted them to do."
3,"Not bad, but no masterpeice.","An enjoyable adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, sort of in the vein of Clueless but without the sparkling wit. It is very predictable, especially for anyone who is familiar with Jane Austen's original work. Georgie is a nice addition to the story--though she could be traced to Margaret in Emma Thompson's adaption, same tomboy zeal for life.Some characters' motiviations aren't very clear to me either, such as Lucy--who is a bit more sterotypical than the original Lucy Steele. Standard nasty blond girl who somehow is the most popular.It also seems that the story contains a bit of an Emma plot line with Abby and her friend (who's name i can't remember--and I only read it yesterday) vying for the same drummer.All in all, it was aptly compared to a teen beach read. The girls are cute, and the story is enjoyable in its fluffiness but not the timeless classic from which it has been clearly taken."
4,Secrets of Love,A very well writen book about three sisters who are going through the problems of teenage love then to top it all of there father dies traggicly and then they have to move out of there house because there father leves in to his seccond wife in the will.So it means new house and new love lifes!A very heart warming novel i loved it!9/10
3,If this were a movie it would be a rental,this book was ok but the story was really BORING! i read it for school and it snunk! i thought it was slow and lame!
4,Shhhh. .,"This was a very interesting book. It was so creative the way it did things anyway, if you like gossip girl you will probobaly like this book. S"
4,Great utensils . . . except the metal spatula,"My son is 17 months old and we got him these utensils to go with his play kitchen. He *loves* the wooden spoon, whisk and rubber spatula. We decided not to give him the metal spatula, though, because its front edge is pretty sharp. We also haven't given him the metal ""crock"" that the utensils are supposed to go in. The top edge of it is also quite sharp, and as you can see from the picture I uploaded, it's so small and tippy that he couldn't possibly get the utensils to stay upright in it. I'm thinking we might get a larger pencil cup (or even a soup can!) and stick it to his kitchen with double-stick tape for him to keep his spoons and spatulas in.The age recommendation on the box is 5+, but I think the wooden spoon, whisk and rubber spatula are fine for toddlers. They're excellent quality and will provide years of pretend stirring! They can also actually be used for real food preparation, if you wish."
3,First glimpse of a genius,"I definitely wouldn't consider this one of Dostoyevsky's masterpieces. In fact, if this had been the first novel I had read by him I would have been greatly disappointed. On the other hand, if you are already a fan of Dostoyevsky then I would recommend Netochka to you. It is an exciting thing to be able to read Dostoyevsky before he truly developed his style. I will admit that at times the book is simply terrible. But at other times, one is able to catch an inkling of the genius that was to awaken years after this first was published. And besides, Dostoyevsky was not known so much for his 'musical diction' but moreso the emotion that he is/was able to convey to his readers. So if you've never read Dostoyevsky I would recommend reading another of his novels first. But if you're interested in how he developed his style, or more accurately where he developed it from, then I would encourage you to read Netochka Nezvanova (Nameless Nobody)."
5,I have to give it five stars because I wrote the book!,"As Amazon has noted above, Atheneum's hardcover edition of Sing Soft, Sing Loud is out of print. Used copies are available via the link provided, but if you prefer a new book, do another search for Sing Sing, Sing Loud and choose the paperback edition from Logoria."
3,Halfway Heaven,The book was in good condition but it was forever before it was mailed out. There was no order number to follow where the book was or to estimate when it would be delivered.
3,Culture of Hip Hop Education 101...,"I have always admired the business savvy Russell Simmons. However, I am a forty-something mother whose son has adopted the hip hop culture. I praise this book because it gave me a clear understanding and appreciation for hip hop, that I did not have in the beginning. The book covers his life, the music indusry and business. I really enjoyed this book and highly recomend it to parents that just don't understand. It also contains some nice photos from Russell's personal collection."
3,"Most costly SAP book, out-dated, but only one on FI, no CO","This is the most expensive SAP book on the market, and I can't understand why, except perhaps because it is the only one covering FI decently. There's no content on CO, and it's based on an old version of SAP. Nevertheless, it provides some helpful insights. But the price is outrageous and not justified--on what basis does it rate as the most expensive SAP book on the market? The publisher should stop gouging and start discounting, since the book's worth is just like yesterday's paper, good for a few days and in special cases, but worthless to many, to be superceded by newer entries (unless it is destined to be a classic, which it ain't). Buy under protest!!"
3,Neatly written but already out-dated,"It appears that this book was written using vers 2.2 - we are already implementing in vers 4.0b. Arguably, many of the processes have not changed - but it is annoying to buy an expensive book that was published in 1998 when vers 3.1 was well established by the time of publication. I still got a few good tips from the book but recommend it for first-time users rather than advanced users or consultants (very little on configuration), particularly given the price (the publisher should consider a cheaper paperback version)."
1,GET A PLAYSTAION!,"I don't own a GC but I heard it's awful for it. I love NFSU + nufsu2, BUT GET A FRICKN PLAYSTATION! OR XBOX! GAMECUBE SUX! I own aPS2 and it's much better than GC. It for kids, I'm fine with kids owning GC, but people over 14 that's kida wierd."
1,not out yet,"Dont review this game if it aint out yet unless its a preview. Need For speed Underground 2 comes to PLaysTation 2 in the year 2004. I wouldent order it yet cuz Midnigt club 3 dub edition will blow it awy, But the first NFSU is out now."
5,Mr. Caps lock is an idiot...,grow up man... i feel the energy for NFSU2 and GT4... the graphics are supposed to be great and gameplay much better than the first one.... this game will probably take up most of my time for the next few month...BTW enrique... grow up man...
1,Warning,"Be careful when you buy this game. I bought this game for my brother, at first he loved it, like he loves all his racing games, but when he started the game, the career game, the game said it can not work. Be careful who you buy it from, I'm trying to return it myself now."
5,Great art book,Wonderful book showing many of Harper's prints as well as a paragraph about each written by him.
4,Handy!,These are the handy little lights!We gave a few as gifts and the folks really liked them too!
2,very very used.,this book i received was very very beat up. it had tape everywhere to hold it together. i was disappointed.
1,False promisses,It could be such a good book but the hero and heroine are so infantile that it really annoying. There are endless dialoges about nothing and the whole setting is not believable. shame
3,Expected better,I found that the heroine was to stubbern for her own good. Imean after her father ... she expected to live her life all alone andin those times it just was not posible. I also could not figure outwhat attracted the hero to her in the first place. She never gave himthe curtices he deserved then somehow by the end of the book they arein love. I comend books with strong female personas but this one hadtoo much. ....
1,A text book kept my attention better.,This book may have been the most dry piece of writing I have ever read hands down. I am a High School student in AP english and this book was required for the class. I picked it up and ten minutes in i thought of shooting myself in the foot if I had to read anymore of it. Long story short i skimmed the entire book and I never read or looked at this book ever again. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS EXCUSE FOR A BOOK!
4,"Good air filter, but thats it.","I have always used K&N air filters in all of my vehicles as they do seem to ""pep up"" my cars and trucks and I like the million mile warranty. However, aside from a minute power increase and warranty, might as well use a factory air filter."
4,great fit,product fit was as described. I installed this before heading out into the mountains for the weekend. i could tell the car was breathing easier. i would recommend.
4,K&N 33-2200 Replacement air filter,"Like this product more engine power but I save gas in a normal driving, means no abrupt acceleration...bottom line saving in the long run, less frequent change of filter"
1,...,"this game is horrible. it is fun the first time you go through it but after you beat it, it isn't fun at all. it takes about 4 hours to beat so please, please, please rent this game for a few days. If you have two thumbs you should have it beat. To top it off the story is horrible. you ""won"" a mansion but there are ghosts in it and this magical old guy gives you this magical vacuum that sucks up ghosts, table cloths, fire, water and you use it to get your brother (mario) out of a picture. I mean come on."
2,Well.....It can get a little boring,"Don't get me wrong, Luigis Mansion is a great game whilr it last. The graphics are amazing, there is no loading time and it is easy to figure out. Also the controller feels like it was made for the game. But, the game is to short and can get boring. It's one of those games that you can rent and beat before returning it. I got this game when I got my Gamecube and I was disappointed with it becaus it wsa so short. I beat it over the weekend and returned it. You can find better games out there than this. I reccomend Super Smash Bros. Melee or for sports lovers, NBA Courtside 2002"
4,"Fun, but short","Luigi's Mansion is a good game, it's fun and stuff. But, it just seems too short. Fun, but short. It's a good concept, too, playing as Luigi in a haunted mansion trying to find Mario. A nice change, playing as Luigi. Just wish it were longer with more to do. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Fun the first time,"Even though Luigi's Mansion is a great game, it is too easy to beat, and there is practically nothing you can do after you've beaten it once. If you really want to play it, I recommend renting it."
3,I bought this for my 4 year old.,My son was not able to play it. He had a fun time watching though. I recommend you be at least 6 year old and can read to enjoy this game.
1,VERY BAD!!,It was so bad. It made no sence. I mean you run around with a vaccuum and vaccuum up ghosts. I sugjest that you dont get the game. You will be bored to tears playing it. So just dont get it.
4,Great Game!!!!!,"This game is one of the best games that I have played. In the game, Mario is trapped in the mansion and Luigi has to save him. It's really fun so you shoulg buy it!"
4,"Good for a debut of Luigi, but quite easy.","I sat down and beat this game within 8 hours. Seeing that I had spent 49.99 on this game the day it came out with the Cube, that was something of a disappointment. It's an excellent game, but at times too easy for its own good. Luigi's vacuum ability takes some time to get used to, but it comes in time. I would probably recommend this game for newbies to the Cube, or die hard Mario fans. With other great games such as The Legend of Zelda for the Cube out there, this probably would do you better to rent it. A cute game though."
5,I can't believe how good this game is!,"I thought when I got this game that My son would enjoy it but it didn't look like something I would like that much.Wow was I wrong! I got so addicted to this game I couldn't put it down!The graphics are great, the game is FUN,and there is enough to keep you busy for a while!rent it before you buy it, it may not be everyones cup of tea!"
2,"Chase, vacuum, unlock, repeat...","Having been brand-loyal to Nintendo since the launch of the NES, my purchase of both the Gamecube and Luigi's Mansion was pretty much a given. While the game looks and sounds *spectacular*, the actual play is mind-numbingly boring. You chase ghosts. You vacuuum ghosts. You unlock doors. Repeat until either game is beaten or you pass out. I would suggest purchasing another game (like Rogue Leader) to show off your new system, and then picking up a copy of LM off a place like ebay in a few months-- there's going to be a tidal wave of copies of this game that no-one wants."
2,Awkward &complicated,"Either I am getting too old or the Mario and Luigi games are wayyyy to complicated these days. I have played my game only about 5 times and I finally have given up. The controls to run the poltergust are just way too awkward. I am great at Starfox,Zelda, and many others but I put that game on and instantly feel ancient and inferior to the other gaming experts out there. Why can't we just get back to eating mushrooms and saving the princess .........."
2,"At most, a rental","Hopefully, this isn't the new standard of Nintendo games. This was short and boring, albeit pretty. I don't know why anyone would want to play it once, let alone twice."
5,The Best Game i've ever played,"This game is very fun. It is not the easyiest game, but that makes it fun. You suck up ghosts with only a flashlight, and a special vaccuem called the poltergust 3000. It's Luigi's turn in the spotlight to save his famous brother, Mario from the Big Bad Boo's. This is a game worth getting!"
3,Too Many Buttons!!!,"This game is interesting, but there are way toomany buttons to press which I personally don't like.You have to press like 4 buttons to get the vacum goingand the flashlight and your moving around.. ugh you getwhat I mean. Its confusing just talking about it!!I recommend you rent this game first before buying it."
2,not so good...,"I bought this game two years ago. I stopped liking it after a month. When I beat it, it just got boring. If you are looking for a good game that will last a long time, this would not be a good choice."
4,fun but extremly short,"I bought the game the day it was realised and it is very cool the gallery ghosts and the end and everything but it is as I said extremly short, and the secret mansion is exactly the same a the first mansion, if your looking for a fun game go ahead and buy it but if you are looking for a game where you will be playing for months this is not for you exept your really bad, but the 50 bucks are worth the short experience"
3,WAY TOO SHORT,"I am much older than most video gamers but I have to say Luigi's Mansion was way too easy and way too short, even for me!"
1,Is there a point?,"This kind of book give travel books a bad name, and the reputation of being written by less than brilliant wandering nitwits. Long-winded, shallow and silly, although she pretends to add depth by paraphrasing standard Japanese history lessons and listing a farily accurate Japanese vocabulary section in the rear. No new, ground-breaking observations, just the same stuff that has been said a thousand times, in a thousand ways about 20 years ago. Don't bother, unless you are some sort of a mystery of the Orient... Even then, you'll be sorely disappionted."
5,Very Pretty,I put this on a long sterling silver necklace. It is exactly as pictured and got a lot of compliments.
1,"Horrible movie, totally silly!","I remember the trailor for this one. They made it look like a horror movie. It is not! I watched the movie about 4 weeks ago, and all I got out of it was disappointment. The movie is nothing but a silly fairytale. Nothing scary about it at all. The creature things don't even bother anybody really in the entire movie. Oh, and by the way, they look ridiculous. They are badly computer generated in the film. Pretty much if you are over the age of 8 or 9, you probably will not like this movie. Unless you are in to fairy tale type movies. Even then, the movie still doesn't make any sense at all. The movie pretty much bored me to sleep. I give it really a 0, but you can only go as low as 1, darn."
4,Entertaining and original,"This movie wasn't as good as it could have been, but it was actually better than I thought it would be. Very different kind of movie. It made me think of a video game where you go in and have to get help from different characters - in this movie the people who live in the complex are those characters and the Lady in the water needs their help. One part I really liked was how Giamatti thought he had all the characters determined based on the advice he got. I think its a movie that tells you everyone needs someone and everyone has something to offer in life."
2,Why... you're not a wizard at all !!,"This is the second clunker in a row from this formerly great director who seems to be drowning under the weight of his reputation.Everyone loved ""The Sixth Sense."" I also loved ""Signs"" and even the slow paced ""Unbreakable."" But ""The Village"" however, left me cold.This movie was an attempt at a modern fairy tale but it fails miserably. There is no sense of wonder and you get that feeling from the major characters themselves. It is dry, flat and, at times, derivative. The title of my review is an example of that and it will be familiar to those who have actually watched the film and recognize the scene which borrows from many fantasies at once. Perhaps this was his intention. If so, he did not pull it off in a way which makes us smile. Just groan.The ending, which I suppose was meant to be inspirational, was just plain silly. Too convoluted. Fairy tales are not supposed to be like that."
2,Really?,I really really tried to sit through this movie i just could not i like M shaymalans movies but this one was just a train reck. The acting was poor the script was poor i felt like i was sitting in silence for over half the movie brokenm up by broken soft spoken dialouge. I think the movie was a good story just poorly executed. i would say skip this if you can and go rent a good movie.
1,"Please, do not watch this movie.",No I take that back. Watch this movie. I want you to buy it and fell free to invite all your friends to watch it at your place. Then when you have a house full of angry people serve an assortment of mixed drinks. Actually you may want to start serving those drinks within the first 5 min of the film and make sure you keep'em coming because your going to need them. I can best describe the experience of watching the lady in the water like this. Have you ever been with a group of friends in a casual setting and one of them farts. When it starts to stink up the room you'll notice every one is covering there nose gagging and carrying on but with a smile on every ones face as if to state that even though the odor that has emitted from ones anus is revolting and I can't breath I can some how find some humor in this moment. Yeah this movie is a lot like that.
1,Bad on every level.,"This film was such a waste of time, not only for me, but I'm sure for all those involved in the making of it. Bad script, bad acting, bad premise, bad bad bad. I'm having a hard time believing I sat thru the whole thing but there is a part of me that has to see how things end, so there you have it.Maybe I'm just not good with fantasy films or perhaps moist maidens, I dunno... but this was just SUCH a laughable, idiotic movie! I can't say enough bad about it. I hope the actors were paid well for suffering through it. I'm usually a big Shamalan fan, but this doesn't even compare to the other films whatsoever."
1,An amazingly poor movie,"Not a good DVD to check out Blu-ray (often dark) and an amazingly poor movie. Paul Giamatti is good, but some of the actors are terrible and the special effects are very uninteresting. The movie just could not hold my interest. I just didn't care what happened to the characters, so it was not frightening."
4,"beautiful, humorous and underrated","I had my doubts about this film, based on the negative reviews it received, but as a reader and writer of fairy-tales, I thought I should take a look. And Guess what? Lady in the Water is really smart, really metafictional, and European in its subtle humor mixed with serious, metaphysical ponderings. The film reminded me alot of Wenders' WINGS OF DESIRE, and in its own way, this film is trying to be that profound. I think it succeeds for the most part, and the film's refusal of simple plot devices -- even as it enunciates them -- adds to its brilliance and its real satisfaction. The ease with which the film presents to us a multicultural society is thrilling in and of itself."
3,Blu-Ray picture quality very poor,I watched this movie in Blu-Ray.I am only going to comment on thequality of the picture. Compared with dozens of otherBlu Ray discs I have seen this one was very poor. It looked more like standard DVD thanBlu-Ray.
1,an empty vessel,"hard to imagine which audience this movie is aimed at, the story is so infantile and ridiculous it is unsatisfying for an adult, and yet plodding and uneventful so boring for kids. if your looking for horror, look elsewhere.Paul Giamatti is the one saving grace, but unfortunately putting a good actor in a movie only serves to highlight the bad acting of certain other actors, notably M. Night Shyamalan, who is perhaps considering a change of career judging by his steady downhill slide as a director and writer."
1,1 of the WORST movies ever made,"Where do I start, this movie was awful for the start to the disappointing end. I would NOT recommend anyone to watch this movie, I would NOT recommend punishing your children by having them watch this movie. THIS IS JUST A BAD IDEA, BAD MOVIE, BAD WASTE OF TIME THAT I CAN NEVER REDEEM. Take my advise, DON'T bother REALLY! After watching approximately 1,500 movies over my life this is EASILY 1 of the WORST movies I have ever wasted my time watching and I have watch a lot of bad movies. Just my $0.02 for what it's worth, I have wasted my time so you don't have to. B Blessed."
3,Entertaining but....,"The movie is entertaining. However, I expected a bit more from M. Night. And, he was asking to be panned by the critics due to his treatment of a critic in the movie. *shrugs* otherwise though, it was okay."
2,LOSES STEAM HALFWAY THROUGH!,"This film almost had me through the first half,but lost me through the second half. Paul Giamatti gives another fine performance in this flat and meandering mess. The DVD looks good so if your into this go ahead,but for me they're are much better movies out there."
3,Liked it,"Again dont trust all the rave reviews , this movie isnt bad at all , but it isnt a knock your socks off movie either. I liked the movie , but it does leave alot left to be desired .. So much of the movie had holes in itand thats what brought down the rating.. I could filll up a whole web page with problems I seen with the movie, But I wont bother .. When reading reviews on some of these movies , you have to be carefull . Some people will say of the best things about some of the worst Movies Ive ever seen . wow , I could go on and on about that . just be carefull ."
1,Lady in the Swimming Pool or a Study in Self-Indulgence,"M. Night Shyamalan literally eviscerates a critic and martyrs himself to save humanity; all in one bedtime movie. Yes, Shyamalan states that his movie was based on a series of bedtime stories he created to entertain his children. The plot is beyond incomprehensible, the characters are completely forgettable, and the creatures aren't remotely believable. Shyamalan attempts to create his own mythology for which he deserves credit. Unfortunately, his movie fails to create a suspension of disbelief because his creatures are ... well silly. What is a ""scrunt"", for example? Is it a vaguely wolf-like creature that defies geometry by lying flat and disappearing? Or, is it a pair of disembodied glowing eyes that saves on the special effects budget? One can only hope his children were truly entertained since no one else seems to have been."
2,Looks great but needs a better story,"I've enjoyed most all of M Knights films, but this one was agony to get through. I don't understand how a film can look so good visually, while at the same time having some of the most muddled, off-the-wall writing. While you could sortof follow along with the story in 'The Village' and 'Unbreakable', 'Lady in the Water' just made no sense from start to finish. It looked great, and the acting was fantastic, but what on earth was going on here? Nerfs? Shaggy, fake-looking CGI dogs? Ridiculous breath-holding sequences underwater?No. This wasn't Nights finest."
3,"It works well, but ...","I own many DeWalt tools and love them. This sander works better than my Porter Cable 333 that has become my last choice now but it's not even close to the Bosch 3727DEVS I got recently. When I use this sander it makes my hand numb and tired very quick and I thought it was normal since I had same experience with the PC 333 sander. But after I got the Bosch, ""Wow"", the balance and level of vibration beat the DeWalt and the PC sanders to the dust, not mention the sanding power of 6"" disc instead of 5"". I can use my dust collector with all three sanders, so there is not much a problem despite the PC sander has the worst fly away canister that is useless. You get what you paid for, I guess. If you want a nice orbital sander that is easy on the hand, Bosch is the way to go."
4,"Good sander, dust bag is an issue","I received this sander about 3 years ago as a promo (when I bought a 12"" Dewalt miter saw). Overall I like it A LOT! I use it for the last three grits of sandpaper prior to finishing. No issues with pads coming off etc... (I've heard of it happening with the PC brand). A real workhorse. Yeah, it has no case, but I just keep it in the box it came in...works for me (and has lasted 3+ years now!).Only gripe: The sanding bag clicks into a plastic fitting, that then SLIDES onto the unit. After a few hours of sanding (i.e. dust starting to clog the fabric, causing more pressure inside the bag), the thing shoots off, blowing fines everywhere. I just deal with it because I really like the sander regardless."
3,"Highland 92105 10' x 1"" Ratchet Tie Down , 900 pound capacity- Set of 4",These are priced right...and you seem to get what you paid for. The mechanism in the ratchet device sometimes gets stuck when you are trying to release the tie-down...but this happens 1-in-20 times...not enough to worry about. Again...the price is right.
2,No Help for me,"As a social worker I thought this book would be more about how to help people who are dealing with eating disorders. However, it was more of a self help book. I do not have an eating disorder so I felt the book was not really directed for me. However, I am an emotional eater. The book made me take a look at how and why I eat. The book was not written really great although it did make some good points. The book had ""homework"" for people which made be helpful for some of my clients who are struggling with an eating disorder. Not a horrible book just not for me."
2,wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be.,"As a woman of God, I looked to this book for hope and faith that one day I'll overcome my eating disorder. I am currently 2 years into recovery from EDNOS.However, although this book isn't as bad as ""the best little girl in the world,"" I was not pleased. I felt like it was going no where. I didn't really get any answers at all. The continuous repetitive thoughts going through my mind basically read ""okay, but... I already knew that... what's next?"""
2,Not recommended,"My dogs tore these to shreds, so I can't say much about them other than the fact that they are not sturdy if you have shredders. Plus, once shredded they expose these little gel ball things that I suppose are suppose to absorb liquid; I have no idea what those little gel balls are made of and did not want my dogs ingesting them, so I had to stop using these pads."
4,Judaism as a Philosophy,"Heschel has one of those rare gifts of being able to take a subject, break it down, and then present it in a manner that most can understand. In this book, Heschel takes a philosophic look at Judaism and why it much more than a religion, but a way of life.Even a Gentile or non-religious reader can come away from this reading with a kinder appreciation for the religion and inherent philosophy of Judaism. Heschel is able to dispel much of the ignorance and hate concerning this great religion.The structure of this book is sound and concise starting with the general notion of why in his mind there simply has to be a creator. Then he moves into the most fundamental of human questions such as good and evil and needs and desires."
5,Too important,I have just begun to read this book and I think it is too important to read it as a study book; it gives you plenty of stuff to meditate and change your view on reality. It has given me daily spiritual food to look deeper and feel more grateful to God for all that is given to us.
5,One Best Book on JVM,This book gives a great detailed description on the JVM. Mr Venners provided a very easy to read book on the supposed difficult topic without sacrificing any technically accuracy. Just wishes every technical books could be written like this one! This book would be perfect if the author gave a case study on an existing Java VM.
5,Required reading for a Policy Practice course,"Different time and place, but the issues discussed continue to impact individuals across the globe. I particulary enjoyed the introduction included in this new edition."
4,"Nice, but a bit powdery.",Not a bad scent as a base to be used with something a bit more edgy. A rather played out fragrance.
4,rockhound widow,"This works as a cane and a shovel. It's pretty handy, and more importantly, my husband couldn't figure out what it was when he opened it on Christmas. He thought it was something to pick up dog flops, which it probably could be used for that too."
5,Super Collection of Great Make-Out Music,"Smooth Jazz is Hot, and perfect for those incredible times when you have to create the perfect mood. This collection is terrific - in fact I bought it twice (scratched the first copy). ""Let Me Count the Ways"" by Dave Koz features vocals by Stevie Nicks - it is a truly spiritual experience."
3,David Alvarado - Transfiguration,"Deep and melodic tech-house: that's the easiest way to describe David Alvarado's TRANSFIGURATION. Alvarado keeps a spiritual element -- listen to the whispers on ""Luna"" -- that make certain tracks seem especially ethereal. Its sibling, ""Luna, Version 2"" is equally dreamy, though without the quasi-religiosity. ""Aire"" is more dubby and dancey, slightly reminiscent of early Swayzak, though the lyrics are slightly trite. ""Raindance"" goes downtempo with some new-agey vocal samples, but ""Sol"" gets things kicking again with a slightly tribal rhythm for a long and driving track. And the final track, ""Transfigured,"" goes off in an unexpected direction -- in some ways, I think I would have liked to see more of that weirdness in other tracks. Still, all in all, a good album."
4,Cute game but for 4 to 6 year olds,Based on other reviewers comments of their younger children liking this game I bought it for my daughter on her 4th birthday.Game installed without a hitch on XP. She loves it.I would agree with others that for a 3/4 year old they will need help. at 7+ they are going to be bored pretty quickly.
2,A Kids Review,Fun at first.after you solve the mystery there's nothing to do.definitley for chirlden 8-
4,Loved it!,"I have to say I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it had its grammar errors, and the flow was a little off, but the story really grabbed you. I started to root for the characters and became invested in their lives. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves a good love story."
2,Not very thoughtful,"The author's efforts are generic geared to express his direction towards the topic rather than to investigate the methods of the west in becoming rich. Details are glossed over for generality, hiding the range of experience of the population during the periods discussed. Summary points are close to modern folklore in their discussion. There is no consideration of the individual in his environment; instead there is a removed observation from a point of view."
4,It was okay,Even though we found out some stuff about Maggie (the ending was pretty sad) it was a boring book. I missed the party life that the Daughters have. We do find out some stuff about her and how she became the Mentor to the Daughters. And something that Maggie has never mentioned before.....
5,Another Good Book,"When I first heard that this book would be about Maggie instead of one of the daughters, I thought it would be really boring and disappointing. But I was wrong! This book was actually very good and it was a nice way to say goodbye to Maggie. All DOTM fans should read this but anyone who likes Greek mytholgy and stuff like that might also find this book slightly interesting."
5,Penelope in ancient Greece,This book gives you history plus a story about Penelope. I like how she is adventurous and goes into the caves and fights the Atrox. I also liked learning how the Atrox was once like a man. My favorite part was when she went into Hades to find Hector. The way she got there was a good part of the story.
2,on parade,The quality on this cd was not very good. The only excellent track on this cd is the Circus Bee march. The track with Washington Gray's march was a terrible recording of a excellent march because the tempo was way too slow. The rest of the tracks were average at their best.
4,Pretty Good,"This book contains wonderful photographs of many tropical marine species. Some of the descriptions of the species, though, use complicated terminology and can be confusing. Other than that, all the features are excellent. After the description of each family of fish, there is a list of genera in that family and information on those genera. Also, each species has its own range map. Species that do not have a photograph are also described briefly. A pretty good book, especially since it has information on so many fish including sharks, rays, eels, and others."
3,Classic album but really annoying,"This is probably one of my favorite albums song choice wise. However, MC Shy D talks over all the songs and after a few listenings, it gets quite annoying."
1,Very unhappy,"This is the first product review I have done, and the first time I have ever been disappointed in a coffee maker. Previously I have had coffee makers eventually die, or have wished for certain features or a slightly better implementation. But this is really a different story, because this coffee maker just makes really bad tasting coffee. I have to think the heating element is not at the right temp, because there is nothing else that can really go wrong. Everything else is fine. Minor quibbles. But they don't matter if the coffee tastes this wrong.I am going to replace it."
1,This coffee pot is terrible!,"I bought this coffee pot because I loved the candy apple red color, but I should have known better from experience. Back in 2001, I bought a Kitchenaide coffee pot that broke 4 times in one year. The digital clock and timer kept malfunctioning. I returned it 3 times to the manufacturer for a replacement, then on the 4th time, I finally threw the pot in the trash and bought a Kenmore. The Kenmore was great but unfortunately, I broke the carafe and they don't sell replacement carafes. The problem with this coffee pot for me was that it leaked coffee out the bottom. We set the timer so we have coffee in the morning.. and when we'd go to poor a cup, we would find coffee all over the counter. We have no idea how or why it was happening. I tried to give this poor pot a chance but it just wouldn't work out. I returned the item and bought a Mr. Coffee. Do not bother wasting your money on a Kitchenaide pot of any kind.. you're paying for the name and the pots are terrible!!"
2,"Looks Nice, thats about it.","I bought this unit because I have always had good luck with the brand name.after three weeks it is now back in its box.Very messy unit. If the carafe is not in just right you get a mess.We never could get the coffee to stop tasting like plastic, everyone complained. We tried all of the recommended cleaning methods, with and without the filter.I finally replaced it. I am not sure what to do with the kitchenaid.I will attempt to get a refund.I did not buy this unit from Amazon, but I did buy my other brand which I have now from Amazon."
2,Leaks Like a Sieve,"My coffee maker is a replacement for my 10 cup previous model which I loved. For a while it worked OK, but then started to leak - big puddles under the base. So I put it away, use my Hamilton Beach, and then take it out again, hoping it won't leak. It does. It makes me crazy because it makes really good coffee. I wish I had my recalled model back. I never should have turned it in."
4,It is good but...,"This book tells you everything you need to know about the subject. Good book well written. But I am a VB geek and all the campanion code is in C#. The book would be so much easier to use if they would of only included VB examples with the C# examples that are available online. I am not even asking that they have the examples in VB in the book, just online. I know that there is not a lot of diffrence between the way C# and VB.net address the objects in Dot.net, but it is a bit of a nusiance trying to figure out things when you have to spend so much time on C#-Centric things rather then the logic of the controls. I dont know how many Vb programmers there are but I would think that it would be worthwhile to have some VB code for the book someplace. I will get through this text but I am spending more time translating the examples into VB then I am getting to know controls."
1,Could you make the subject more difficult? No.,"I have been a C++ (Visual / MFC/ WinAPI) developer for nigh on 10 years and I think this book is extremely confusing.I've written my own navigation control in VB and wanted to learn more, in depth, about how to create controls and implement design-time behavior. This book just kills me.I read the first 3 chapters with a question mark imprinted on my brain. In those first 3 chapters the authors explain (I guess you could call it explain) delegates, page programming model, and event-handling and none of it sinks in. I've read the chapters 2 times and still I'm staring at a question mark.And, after 3 chapters I expect a sample relating to a control, but here I have nothing.And I really like Jesse Liberty's books and I see his compliment above. I guess this book is for PURE GENIUSes. So if you're a PURE GENIUS, then you may like this book. Otherwise, keep on searching. Maybe chapter 4 will be better.I can only hope the question marks go away."
3,"Great book, but a bit of a lost-leader","I thought this was a good reference for someone interested in starting a software company, but with no previous background. It is written in a simple style, and touches on everything. I had found much of the information in other places, but it is very good to have it all bound together in one place.I have one, major complaint. Every other page of the book, it seems, refers to forms, contact information, or further topical information that is on the companion CD. The CD does NOT come with the book, however. If you call the number listed on the back page, you will find that it is available for $29.95.It is frustrating to be constantly reminded in the text that you do not have much of the available information in hand, but could if you spend another $30. It's a nice piece of marketing by the author, I guess, but it has damaged his credibility with me. I won't purchase other books by him in the future."
5,Very useful,"After 15 years doing software development for others, I had been thinking about going out on my own, and this book was exactly what I needed to get started. One of the reasons I particularly liked it was that it isn't too theoretical. The author gives specific instructions and ideas on how to actually set up your business, turn your software into an actual products, and--most importantly--get your software sold. If you're starting a software business, or just thinking or dreaming about it, I would definitely get this book."
4,Good item as a gift,"Good item as a gift, though the stain was actually darker than pictured and does not let the grain of the wood show much.Still a good value."
1,Junk,Featured item is smaller than appears in photo.Item appears to be heavy duty steel or like material. Rack is nothing like appearance - This item is very chaeply made. Very flimsy.
4,Got the mail off the table!!!,"I read the reviews and was concerned about the size before buying this product but it matched my decor so I gave it a shot. It really is VERY small, but still managed to do the job. I was surprised at the amount of mail it can organize and hold. All in all it's a great buy and I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Enough,"Nintendo should start making good games instead of these stupid survival horror ones. They have no games as good as GTA3 or Halo yet. I hope this changes soon. Right now, if you are to get a game, i would recomend super smash bros."
1,Too small,This is the largest size but it is still to small. It is suppose to fit my 2012 Camry. It is too wide side to side but too short top to bottom. My visors are barely able to hold the shade from falling from the windshield. I don't know why manufacturers can't seem to make these fit new cars.
1,Two weeks an no ship date....,"I placed an order for this product two weeks ago, and still 'no ship date yet'. May want to think twice before ordering this one, again, if ever, again.."
1,sea buckthorn,"i ordered this product in hopes of getting results only they back logged my order and i ended up with nothing, why advertise you have something and end up with nothing, very disappointed with the way amazon handled my order"
2,disappointing,"My daughter was given this game on her 5th birthday and it was a huge disappointment. The game as a whole is simplistic and dull, and my daughter has only played it a handful of times. She always chooses her Barbie as Rapunzel game instead."
2,worse game ever,this is a bad game for young age because its too easy and short and old kids will just HATE it! its simple game that has less than 8 games. my daughter finished within 3 hours! she is 4 and this game is way too easy for her. the only part she likes is when you make a crown and the graphics are cute but a reall let down!
3,A flawed but intriguing album,"I couldn't get some of the songs out of my head, but JP (to my mind) did not have the voice to carry a whole album, and I hate the way that the album begins. The backup singers are great, though."
3,Music,It is just okay to me. I think I like a different type of music sound....this is not to discount that it is a good album.
3,Required extra purchase,The Stack-On DS-30 Storage Cabinet I purchased didn't have near enough dividers that came with it so I had to buy extra ones which I don't think I should have had to do.
4,Expensive but the only place I could find it,"This was one of the only places I could find these little dividers. They're relatively expensive and if I had thought about it and wanted to spend the effort I could have just bought a sheet of plastic/lexan and cut some out myself. Regardless, they work as advertized but I gave it 4 stars because of the price."
1,Garbage,"Okay ... I will admit, they do function as they are supposed to, but ... this company should be ashamed of themselves. These are nothing more than brittle pieces of plastic that you have to separate from one another. That leaves sharp edges on them, which is annoying. These really should have come free with the organizer rather than sold separately."
1,No product in package!,"When I opened the store package, there was nothing it it. The package that it was sent in didn't look like it was tampered with. However, the store package had scotch tape on the sides. There was no product in the store package. Needless to say, I wasn't pleased. I was refunded the full amount approximately 5 days after reporting the problem."
3,"Comfortable material, but snug fit","I like the style and feel of this athletic supporter, but it's a bit too snug in the straps, even though I used the sizing chart provided in the item listing. If you prefer a fit that's not overly tight, I'd suggest ordering the next size larger. Still, a decent jock for the price."
3,I agree with Saddelbum,"I give this video 3 stars because what Mr. Hempfling is showing us is awsome, but the video is way too short and he does not show how he gets from A to Z. It would have been great if he would have taken one of those stallions and shown how he worked him from start to finish. Instead, you just see clips - granted he is showing you the body language he is using, but in order to put it all together, it would have been nice to see it all."
4,Fun computer game,"My 4 year old daughter loves this game and wants to play it everyday since we ordered it. Most of the screens are easy enough for her, however there are a few that she finds some difficulty with. One such page asks her to sequence bottles of potions (kind of like the old ""Simon"" game). Another page asks her to complete a mirror image of a scene. Still she manages and is eager to try it...it wouldn't keep me from purchasing it."
2,good product but...,"When I replaced the existing cartridge, I notice ink still oozing out the cartridge. Which leads me to believe the chip on these cartridges are set to expire at a set amount prints. Don't get me wrong, it's a great product and prints beautiful pictures but it sucks that Epson won't create a printer that uses a universal cartridge that works for all their printers."
3,Ectaco Partner EP-X8 English Polish Bidirectional Talking Dictionary and Language Learning System,"The purchase is worth the money spent. Although I speak English fluently, it will be an important assistent in my work."
1,Simply awful,"It is amazing to me that this kind of stuff gets published. Why is there such a craze for good-little-desi-novels in the west? the writing is horrendous, the imagery is trite, and the plot perfectly predictable. I would say that this is the worst book I have read in my lifetime; coming from a person who reads two books a week for the publishing industry, this really is saying something. Another note, speaking of publishing: connections will get you everywhere--to all budding writers, keep this in mind. It clearly worked for this one."
4,Can't wait to see more by this author!,"Motherland is a wonderful first novel by Vineeta Vijayaraghavan. A story told in the first person of a 15 year old girl visiting with her relatives in India. The story depicts Maya's struggles with mixing Indian culture and American culture. Told in a very respectful and vivid manner this book gave me new understanding of Indian life. The most poignant part of Motherland is the relationship between Maya and her grandmother (Ammamma) who raised her for the first four years of her life. Adolescence can strain any and all family relationships at times. This story shows how special the relationships between grandmothers and granddaughters can be. Being very close to my own grandmother and losing her at age 16, Motherland brought back a lot of fond memories of my own relationship with my Ammamma."
1,Misplaced Nostalgic Drivel,"I give this book one star only because I need to give it some stars at all in order to register this review. Aside from the clever beginning, there is very little redeeming in this book: the imagery is tired, the prose insipid, and the ""journey to acestral land"" plot tiresome, and utterly formulaic. Maya goes back to South India, and discovers there the magic of tropical foliage, family ties, and sultry weather--the stage is set for the inevitable family secrets, the conspicuously ""protruding"" and ill-fitting political sub-plot, and the inexorable and exhausted ending celebrating a ""found self"" and a realization that Maya can make any place her home. The reader keeps wishing that much of this book is ironic, and written in mimicry of its genre, but alas, ""Motherland"" follows the predictable and better-off-foresaken path religiously. The story is sheer nostalgic drivel, of the sort we have read over and over again."
1,I still have not received this item. This is my third email what is the deal sheila quinn,I still have not received this item . I have sent emails. What is the deal . sheila quinn
1,Waste of money,I thank God I can get my money back on this book. If I want a book written like a women I will buy one by a women authorRalph W Holbrook
2,No Excuses,"I confess that I did not get very far into this story before I deleted it from my Kindle.In this day and age, there is absolutley no excuse whatsoever for bad spelling and atrocious grammar in ANY written work. There is no reason to have a hy-phenated word in the middle of a line...see that example. Things like that annoy me no end(I should have been a proof-reader...I know that I would have done a much, much better job), and to that end, I just pushed the button.Honestly, I think the story could have been good...I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.If I had to give it a mark out of 10? The answer would be a 2. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the author. Shame!!"
3,Fairly Competent,This was quite a good thriller though it wasn't anything special.It was quite well written and it flowed quite nicely.However it did get very predictable and people kept doing stupid things all the time.The build up was generally nicely handled but the execution was poor.For a free book though I did enjoy it.There were no real problems with typos or formatting.
4,love it but....,"you know i grew up watching this show on USA back in tha day. though watching seasons 3 and 4 i can see why it got cancelled. wtf is with all the singing? seasons 1 and 2 were awesome, then they decided to make it a little bit more cartoonish by adding musicals. and Beatrice what happened to her? the series just ended no closure nothing. I love this show but i can see why it got cancelled. still very much worth owning for any 90's collection though."
1,wrong item sent,Wrong item sent. Will cost more to return it and pay return postage. Item also does not play in CD player
5,Schwinn Maven Boy's 20-Inch BMX Bike,I purchased this bike for my grandson. He loves it and all his friends also loved it. It is a very stable bike even in the grass. I highly recommend it.
1,Very Frustrating,Save yourself the stress and don't buy this printer. When it prints it prints beautifully. But it rarely prints correctly. If you don't use it for a day the nozzles clog and you have to clean them (of course you don't know that until you've wasted a print sometimes) That uses up valuable ink. Even in the middle of of printing a queue of photos the heads can clog - meaning that you can't send it more than one photo at a time. I'm retiring mine and just keeping it around for the few times I need large format. Wish I hadn't wasted money on it.
3,Epson 2200 Review,"1. For baseline, I have used an Epson 1280 for the past two years.2. The only reason to get this printer is if one wants longer life prints. The print quality / image is MORE difficult to achieve with this printer--not impossible, but more difficult. Overall, the paper profiles are fairly good (epson papers)--the colors are fairly accurate. However, the prints are definitely ""flatter"" (ie less contrast, less saturation) compared to the 1280--this can be worked around to a large extent by simply increasing contrast (esp the black point) and saturation...around by 10 points.3. Overall, I like the 1280 prints better to a slight degree, but if viewed by itself without a comparison print, the prints from the 2200 are good. Furthermore, with the increase in print life, overall it's a decent compromise for me. One has to evaluate their own priorities to see if it would be worth it for them."
1,Frustrations galore!,"I'm in college and have no choice but to use this printer to print out important projects. I work with Illustrator and InDesign, and though I resize the file image to a size far smaller than the huge matte paper that I must print with, the printer either consistently crops everything or makes the image smaller than I specified. This cost me many sheets of expensive matte paper, and probably half of the school's ink supply, just trying to GET IT RIGHT.The one time that I succeeded in configuring everything correctly, which took far more time, sweat and tears than a simple printer should deserve, the print quality was horrible. There were rows of thin white lines going across the image. I hope after I leave school that I will never see this printer again."
4,Excellent writing,"I've always liked Cecilia Tan's writing which is almost poetic at times. This little pamphlet collection of short stories focuses on BDSM, fantasy, and erotica with just a splash of horror for good measure. ""Telepaths Don't Need Safewords"" is self-explanatory: if you can read each other's minds, there's no need to establish a safe word! ""Cat Scratch Fever"" is a beautiful, haunting tale (no pun intended) of a rather interesting love match. And ""Heart's Desire"" tracks Cleo's attraction to and love for another's sub. All in all, this collection is beautifully written, entertaining, and downright erotic. Tan's skills shine throughout. I enjoyed reading this and am quite glad I ordered it."
4,I work in this Industry...,"... and found the scope and accuracy of this book good. I expected more though- the general public is not aware of the politics, confusion and back stories that have a direct impact on their health. I would have love to see the book pushed a bit further into these areas. Still a good dive into this monster of a government bureaucracy."
3,Nascar Video Volume one 1991 VHS.,"Pretty good period footage of that particular time, techniques on how to properly merge and exit off an interstate with a famous driver, one on one interviews with the drivers and racing footage. Would recommend to racing fans."
3,Great game for a 9 year old girl,"My daughter will be 9 soon and she loves to play this game with her friends. Quite frankly, it is not my favorite game. There is absolutely no educational value to this game. However, my daughter enjoys it so I allow her to play it in moderation. She has had the game now for several months and does not seem to have gotten bored with it. Her friends love to play with it too and they play it together to come up with different designs. This is definitely not for a tom-boy!I cannot give it more stars because it does not work on Macs."
2,"I had High hopes, this just isn't that good.","When I first read the reviews for this album, I had extremely high hopes. Almost every review of this album compared these guys to early Guns 'N' Roses. I'll have to rain on the parade guys! These guys sound nothing like GNR', and i'm being very gracious.The Sea Hags try to rock hard and gritty, it just seems to be contrived and un-original. Most of the songs on the debut aren't really that strong, and the choruses just seem to repeat the same lines over and over. I would have rated this release lower if not for the song ""Half the Way Valley"", which is pretty much the only reason I bought the album to begin with.You would do better looking elsewhere for you GNR needs. I'm gonna state this so nobody thinks i'm being a butt, i'm a huge fan of anything hard or melodic rock from the late 80's or early 90's. So this review has nothing to do with the time period, it has everything to do with a sub-par hard rock record."
5,This Improved Swivel Design Has Improved Sound Too!!,"Well Coby has improved the swivel design here, and made the unit feel lighter too. One of the great caveats is that now you can charge just the battery alone without it being connected to the unit. Somehow with the spread accross the screen speakers it has improved the sound quality also."
4,Very Good,"This book was equally, if not better than it`s prequel.After reading the first, I wasn`t to sure about reading the second after the first left me feeling pretty depressed, though I did it anyway and was greatly rewarded with a more upbeat book, compared to the first. Longtusk is better probably because of the less violence and a more descriptive plotline. The info on how the Mammoths live was riveting as was how they desribed the Neanderthals and early Homo-Sapiens.It was a great read.I eagerly await the third arriving."
2,Disappointing!,"The doll is pretty and very attractive for little girls who love mermaid. However, the design is not good. There is no on/off switch, and so we cannot stop the doll from moving and making a big noise. The only way is to take out the batteries. But it is not easy, as you need a screw-driver to do so. At the end, it became so annoying that we took out the batteries and the doll is played as it is, without moving. Quite disappointing!"
4,"An Outline, Not A Thesis","I had reached tentative conclusions similar to the authors from my own readings and induction. I had hoped that the Blumrosens would present the sorts of primary references that would indisputably support the pattern I thought I had detected.The question I asked myself is: why would the rich and successful plantation owners of the South support the rebellion? The main answer I could find was the preservation of slavery.Unfortunately,this book makes the argument, but it lacks the evidence. As another reviewer notes, the authors weaken their own case by their methods. (I find particularly unacceptable phrases such as ""must have"" when trying to ascribe motivations to individuals or groups. Are the authors psychics? If it isn't on record you can't make the assumption)My own opinion is that it is difficult to imagine that the book's argument is not correct; but that is my opinion, it is not history. Though definitely worth reading, ""Slave Nation"" is also not good history."
3,good but flawed as a soundtrack,"All the tracks a very good (mostly) cover versions of well known songs and they are done very well. The flaw as already mentioned is that they missed off some of the best tracks (Who decides which tracks go on the cd from the films? They never seem to get it right do they)The best 'missing' track is ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" sung by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole but you can find it on his album Facing Future. You should be able to find it from that info :)"
3,Cool but Missing lots of Tracks?,"I liked the movie... funny as hell but i also liked the music. My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing... one being ""Amber"" by ""311"" which is on thier ""from chaos"" album. They played this track at least 5 times in the movie and even in the trailer... so why didn't they include in in the soundtrack. If anyone has the answer reply."
5,Great CD... now where is the other one?,"This is a great soundtrack. I was sad that it didn't include all the songs from the movie though, and hope that there will be a second cd like with the Wedding Singer.The remakes of all the 80's songs are great. It's a fun way to listen to old favorites, and it's a fun and upbeat cd."
4,Dissapointed,"I purchased the CD without reading the reviews but I won't do that again. I was also disappointed that several songs were left off. I guess I'm too trusting and assumed that if it said ""sound track"" that all the songs would be included. Another new lesson learned."
4,Does somebody can help me?....,"Actually i must tell you that i ve not already seen this movie...but by watching several time the trailer, i just enjoy the soundtrack...So i bought it...and it s a real good one!!!But i really miss something...i m actually in search for one song of the trailer that i was waiting to find in the cd...that s a song about energie i think (sorry that s the only word i can peek with my bad english..i m french..) and you can hear it when Drew B.is painting a big painting against a wall...i just fall in love by hearing this song and really would like to find it!!!!Can anybody help me????please please, please....thank you!!!!"
2,50 first Dates CD,I was very disappointed with the recordings. They did not sound like the originals or what I heard on the movie
1,So many covers....So few good ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'm sorry but there are too many bad covers on here and just about any other film soundtrack lately!!!The music and film industry of late is just out of ideas and this CD proves it. A cd full of covers and a film based on other films.Let's see the original songs used more often!!! Lets not see another cd like this.
5,Excellent,"i usually dont buy cds but this i couldnt resist. i am a big fan of reggae and even a bigger fan of 80s music. this is cd has some of the most awesome tracks ever made. i would have been pissed if they would have cut any of these songs and replaced them with ones they didnt include, this was a perfect compilation."
2,Misleading,"After seeing the movie, I thought the soundtrack would be excellent. However, the best songs WERE NOT included in the soundtrack. How can you not include the Beach Boys and IZ???"
2,50 first dates,"Not as good as I thought it would be, don't know most of the songs I thought it would be truer to the movie, I wont be playing it much"
2,50 first dates but no rainbow!,"This technically the sound track from 50 First Dates and it does have Adam Sandler's quirky little tune, Forgetful Lucy. But, and this is a big but, it does not have Over the Rainbow, the closing tune by Ike. The music on the CD is fair enough and some is good. However, where's the rainbow at the end of the CD? Maybe the enhanced version has it, but the version I got from Amazon is rainbow-less and so much the poorer for its absence."
3,Left some songs out...,"All I can say was that I loved this movie, but the soundtrack should have included The Beach Boys AND the amazing cover of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow."" I am disappointed."
3,Buyer Beware,"I like the soundtrack, but the most beautiful song is missing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" This is NOT the full soundtrack.t"
3,Missing the Best Stuff,"I'm not even buying this album because they've left off the best stuff, ie. the marimba score selections. Please correct me if I'm missing something or tell me if I can buy these on another album."
2,311: Where Are You?,"Hardcore 311 fan here since Down. I'm disappointed with 311's cover of ""Love Song"" simply because they're slowly but surely breaking away from the classic 311 style. It's a nice song, but I don't see what it does for music and its advancement. 311 has always pushed the envelope as ""the alternative band,"" but I'm starting to wonder lately where that band went."
4,"Good cd, but missing a major song","We enjoyed this cd, but found that we really missed the ""Over The Rainbow"" song by the great ""IZ"". There may have been some legal reason why this song was not on this cd, but I know many, many people who assumed the Rainbow song would be on the cd and were disappointed."
1,NO Bruddah IZ...,"Actually, Bruddah IZ ( who did ""over the rainbow"" at the end of the movie) was NOT in the film. He died in 1997, due to his lifelong fight with obesity. Leaving him out of this soundtrack is a horrible mistake."
4,Good Soundtrack,"Why are songs missing? Well they went with a theme, if the song wasn't remade for the movie (or made for the movie), it wasn't included, pretty simple. If you want ""Amber"" by 311 get their album, if you want ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", buy Bruddah Iz's album.If you looked at what was on there before buying there wouldn't be a problem. You should take a look at what you are buying before you buy it, ESPECIALLY WITH SOUNDTRACKS, as they are notorious for not including all songs either used in the movie or in advertising. This is NOT THE ONLY SOUNDTRACK TO DO THIS.I really like this soundtrack. I thought just about all of these remakes were pretty good. It's tough to take a song that alot of people already like and make it different and have it work and I think most of the songs ""work"". I'm still undecided about the version of ""True"" however . . ."
3,Missing Music,"I enjoyed some of this CD; however, I was hugely disappointed because 2 of the main songs I wanted from the movie were NOT included on the CD. One was a Beach Boys song ""Wouldn't it be nice?"" which played on and off throughout the entire movie. The other was a nice version of Over the Rainbow which played at the end.When something is called a soundtrack, it should have all the songs. Bummer!!!!!!"
1,Totally Disappointed,"All the songs they chose to put on the soundtrack stink, whether you're a regae lover or not. I just blew 14 bucks. (...) They must know they left out all the best music from the movie. They are either coming out with yet another soundtrack like ""More songs from 50 First Dates"" as a money making scam, or the rights to the songs were to expensive to include them on the CD (like the millions they made off of the movie wasn't quite enough to cover it). I'm a big fan of both actors and feel really hurt that they would let their fans be deceived like this! I really loved those good songs and now can't get them. PS. I'm also a huge ""The Cure"" fan and still think all the remixes stink!"
2,Seriously Disappointed,"Saw the movie and loved the songs but when I got the cd I was seriously disappointed. I enjoyed the songs on the cd but wish they had included some of the others from the film instead. The WORST OFFENSE: not including IZ's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" which ties the whole film together at the end."
2,Energy Song,"For everyone wondering the name of the song playing while Lucy paints . . It is ""AMBER"" from 311's CD From Chaos! It definetly should have been part of the soundtrack along with ""Over the Rainbow"" by Israel Kamakawiwo`ole!!!"
2,A Lot of Covers,"I don't hate all covers, but most of these weren't my cup of tea. That being said, I'm not a fan of the island sound, so someone who is might love this music."
3,Wrong Island?,"This movie is set in Hawaii. I was expecting to hear more beach like songs. Like the Beach Boys (since it played a big role in the plot) and Somewhere Over the Rainbow. However, most of these songs have a reggae feel, which leads me to think I am in Jamaica. I think they got their islands mixed up! But even so, I liked 9 out of the 13 songs, so it was still worth it."
5,Great Story,"If you are a Lou Ferrigno fan, or enjoy drug free bodybuilding this is some great inspiration. It was recommended to me by a friend, and is a very short read. The book is about Ferrigno's life growing up, and the events that led him to winning the Mr. Universe competition, and starring in the Incredible Hulk. It also contains some very basic bodybuilding routines, though they certainly aren't the reason to read the text."
1,This book is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is an example of an auther trying to tell a classic tale but failing miserably! Bland carecters,and a horible plot line make this book a work of pure pap and drech! 0 stars"
2,Flat,"This book is barely readable. I read about half of it before deciding it was too painfully boring to continue with. McKinley clearly knew the skeleton of the story she wanted to tell but failed to give it any spark of life. The writing style comes off as incredibly passive--there is never any sense of immediacy, and the scenes that should have the most action are unwieldy and sometimes interrupted by irrelevant descriptions. Every event feels forced, as though McKinley wrote an outline based on other Robin Hood stories and followed the outline like a business agenda without any regard to narrative flow. The dialog is marked by attempts at renaissance-fair wit that comes off as neither accurate nor witty, and often requires re-reading figure out what was meant. The characters are flat, the world building (no matter how well researched) is flat. It is totally beyond me why this has so many glowing reviews."
5,Review of Super Smash Bros. Melee,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is a fun, fast-paced action/(4 player) fighting game with wonderous graphics. If, no WHEN, your'e going to get this game, get a memory card-you'll need it."
3,"A good game, but did not meet my expectations....","This game is great, but it did not meet my expectations...Pros:-Theres 24 characters...that's alot to master...-There's a new Allstar mode, which is kool...-You can collect trophies - collecting them all will take a while...but it's cool to see all the trophies on your ""table""-Event mode, in which you have to accomplish something with a special rule...Cons:-Adventure mode is BORING!-Every character, new and old now has Forward B attacks. This causes you to accidently do this attack occasionally when trying to use your B attack and Up B.-Everyone's voice sounds corny (especially Peach)-Some old characters just suck now... (Such as Kirby and Ness)Something in this game is missing...it's not enjoyable as it was when the first SSB came out..."
5,Super Smash Bros. melee rocks!!!,"If you have a Nintendo gamecube, you must have this Game. Here is some information about the Game.-1-4 Players!-Easy to Play!-Play as Mario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Pikachu, and many more!-Win Characters like Luigi and Mewtwo!-Play special Game modes like Giant melee!Super Smash Bros. Melee is one of the best Video Games ever!"
5,The best of the battle games...so far!,"This game is worth having. Sheer action without bloodhshed is always nice to see. The cameos were awesome, and I love being able to fight with my favorite video game villian of all time.SSBM is awesome, but I'm hoping that Soul Calibur II will be able to match it."
5,One of Nintendo's best games,"Combining the very elements that make Nintendo, Nintendo, and unleashing them in this game.All of the popular video game heroes. Fox, Link, Pikachu, etc.) And villains; Bowser, Ganon, and Mewtwo, etc.)You're bound to find at least two characters you enjoy playing with because the gameplay is great.Its one of the few games that has replayability for years, imo.I didn't get this from amazon, but I just had to leave a review. Its one of my favorite games of all time. Top 5 for sure."
5,GREAT!!,"100 times better than the original, you can get a ton of secret characters (I've got about 7 already) and over 300 (I think) trophies (who knows how many I have). Simply the best fighting game EVER!"
5,Best...Gamecube game...ever!,"... I luv this game more than anything! It's the best game for Nintendo GameCube! It has really fun adventure fighting. ALL Video Game fans should get this!! Well, I didnt beat it yet. U should get this when u get Game Cube ..."
5,You say you wanna see Link stab Kirby?,"no problem,with this game,you can pull offf any fight you want with Famous Nintendo Characters!I'd say that the term ""this game is great"" is a FACT,not an opinion and if you don't belive me than play it and find out!I'm not going to write a big review but BE WARNED!!!! THE GAME DOES NOT COME WITH FREE MARSHMALLOWS!!!"
3,This game is Ok,"I think that this game is alright.You start off with a certain amount of people. You have to beat all of these boards to get another or some of the best people.The game is cool and fun once you get everyone to play with.It would be fun to play with people who are very good at fighting.If you're not that good, then it probably won't be real fun."
5,THIS GAME RULES,"I couldn't stop playing to original SSB, but now there's going to be one for the NINTENDO GAMECUBE! SO what I'm pretty much saying is, you can't lose buying this game, it is going to rock."
4,"not exactly street figther, but i is still a good game","pros. 25 well known nintendocharacters like Mario, Link, Pikachu and Kirby. many cool arenas. 51 missions in event mode. one of the greatest multiplayer games ever. the sound comes from classic nintendogames like, super mario bros., the legend of zelda, pokemon stadium and DR. Mario. many trophies to collect.all-star mode and classic mode rocks. fun minigames, like break the target and racecons. Pichu, Roy, DR. Mario, Gannondorf, Falco and young Link are just copies of Pikachu, Marth, Mario, Capt. Falcon, Fox and Link. i arenas like Big blue and Icecle mountain you dont get to figth that much because the arena is moving so you are busy trying to save youre ass. Yoshi, Peach and Iceclimbers are too weak or to hard to play whit. it takes 4ever to unlock Mewtwo and Mr. game and watch. adventure mode is too boring"
4,PRETTY GOOD,"I had this game for 6 months now and I still play it all the time. It is a great game for multiple people. One player isn't great, so don't buy this unless you have friends or family to play it with. tournaments are fun, but only if you have 4 controlls and can play 4 to a match. It also takes too l;ong to skip the computer matches.It is fun but COULD BE BETTER"
5,"Better than Brawl, and a classic fighter","This game is truly great, and is certainly the best Super Smash Bros title. It added onto the genius of SSB multiplayer and refined its fighting mechanisms. The music is great, the stages are all good, the characters are awesome, and the fighting mechanics are deep and have a learning curve with lots of room for learning. Brawl was a good game, but watered down the technicality that melee packed.Simply put, this is my favorite game ever, and if you somehow haven't played it do yourself a favor and have some friends over and get lost in the multiplayer madness."
5,My favorite Gamecube game,"Out of all the Gamecube games I have, the one I can always play and the one I play the most is Super Smash Bros Melee. This is one of those games that is great to get out when friends come over. Once I start playing against somebody else thats good, its hard to stop. Its easy to spend hours playing several rounds trying to discover new ways to defeat your enemies. Overall, if you have a Gamecube and still don't have this game, you really owe it to yourself to pick this up."
3,A good multiplayer game,"This game is VERY fun when you play with two or more players. However, when it comes to single player, it falls short in many ways. While it IS fun to play adventure mode (a very cool mode where you can play in super mario style) it grows old very quickly, as you face the same type of enemies over and over. The ""Classic"" mode single player is simply to repetetive. Once you beat the classic mode with one of the characters, the rest of them are the same, as you face the same opponents every time. However, this game is VERY fun multiplayer. You can set it to timed mode, where you play for a certain amount of time (YOU CHOOSE!) or knockout (where you have a certain amount of lives). The only thing about multiplayer is you have to beat single player to get extra characters (see above info about single player). My conclusion about this game is that it deserves three stars, since you really cant fully enjoy it without at least two controllers."
4,zzzz..... Gettin' kind of bored.....,"This is a great game, but there are lots, and lots of games that are a better BUY. This game gets kind of boring and is mostly fun when you are doing multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game, but a renting for a week is a better deal before you buy it!-Doug"
5,awsome and addictive,"This game is sooooo good. I can't stop playing it. The graphics are pretty good. The different modes are really fun. I like that there are more secret characters and more things to do than SSBM1. Marth, Roy, Kirby,Zelda(or Sheik), and Mewtwo are relly good.You should definately go out and buy this game ASAP. It is 1 of the most popular ones"
5,If you don't wanna know how to beat it don't read it.,"First of all this game is really good , also buy sonic adventure 2 battle, spiderman, and ssx tricky for a great arsenal of games. Second of all, the controls are great , it has good graphics, and there are some really cool combos.Well any way, to get marth play versus with everybody,to get roy play classic with marth, to get ganandorf beat event match 29: Triforce Gathering and for the other people it will take forever to type.And finally, this is super smash bros for N64 except there are at least five new versions of game play, some good char. you start with(like ness and C. falcon) and level 9 of the regular game would equal level 7 on this game, well that's all folks!"
5,THIS GAME IS GREAT!,O man i just bought game cube about a month ago and i absolutley hate it! all the games stink but this 1 i love combat and what better way 2 release ur anger then on a nintendo character. i play this game 5 hours a day! best game ever
5,Smash Bros. once again rules Nintendo,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is definintely a good game to buy for the gamecube, especially if you have played the first one on N64. If you liked the 1st one, you'll like the 2nd one, and if you don't have the 1st one, you'll like this one anyway. There are many new characters, including the girls such as Peach and Zelda (who can transform into Sheik). There are also twice as many courses than there were in the original, and they have much better quality graphics. There are also more secret courses and characters to unlock. And to add to that, there is even a new mode called adventure mode. Adventure mode is just like the classic, except you travel throughout different worlds and defeat different bosses. It's a bit more exciting than the classic version. The bottom line is, buy this game if you liked the 1st one."
5,WOW my nieces love this game!,My nieces are 10 and 7 and they love this game. My sister can't keep them away from it. Buy it now for your kids because it's totally worth the money. It's an amazing game!
4,"The Best of all games ,SUPER SMASH BROS","these are my thoughts and codes for this gameTHOUGHTS1.I like this game because you can fight in master hands courtCODES FOR SECRET CHARECTERS(REAL ONES)1.FALCO;PLAY 100 MAN MELEE2.MEW2;PLAY VS FOR 20 HOURS3.DR.MARIO;PLAY AS MARIO ON ADVENTURE WITHOUT ANY CONTINUES4.LUIGI;PLAY FIRST LEVEL OF ADVENTURE AND GET A 2 AT THE LAST SECOND(NOTE;ALSO FINISH ADVENTURE)5.JIGGLYPUFF;PLAY CLASSIC OR ADVENTURE ONCE6.PICHU;BEAT EVENT MATCH 377.GANNODORF;BEAT EVENT MATCH 298.LINK AT THE AGE OF 7;SORRY FORGOT9.MR. GAME AND WATCH;BEAT TARGET TEST WITH ALL CHARECTERS10 EVERYBODY;PLAY 1,000 VS MATCHES"
2,Nintendo 64 version was soooooo much better,"The Video Game characters from the golden agecome together..... to create one game that is so boring I feel sorry for Link and Mario. However, I smiled a few times at the items you got such as a giant hammer (Donkey Kong, Arcade), a Poison mushroom (Super Mario Chronicles, Only in Japan), and an arrow barrel (Donkey Kong Country, Super Nintendo). The graphics had my mouth watering, but this game has so much to do that you eventually get tired of beating luigi and peach under a time limit, buying trophies out of a GUMBALL MACHINE, and trying do do event mode. Sorry Nintendo but you have been rejected!"
2,Melee is Violent,This game is ALL FIGHTING. Nothing but fighting. We were searching for a game that both our kids could play together. They fight each other in this one when playing in the two player mode. Anyone who thinks playing these games doesn't evoke similar emotions is kidding themselves. I would not recommend this game.
2,Not up-to-date,This book does not contain the most up-to-date therapy techniques. Some oldy-but-goody techniques are helpful.
2,Not Met to Be Moved Around,On this castle the sides are pretty thin pressed wood screws are not stilling in so for the price 2 stars rating
4,Balls To Go,"Purchased this product at least 3 years ago....still got it, still carries my balls and other necessities. Simple wipe down, lightweight and small enough to do it's job. So the investment has lasted."
2,American Style,"Most Jokes are Designed for the American people Foreigners like me find it hard to know what the author is talking about in many jokes. I summarized 32 jokes out, some are very good, but in the end I could have been on a Distribution list and go more for free !"
4,Positive witchcraft with lesson learned,"Season Two brought a different flavor with the same purpose: looking at the good side of witchcraft that is entertaining; lessons learned in life; each sister developed its character attractively savvy and appealling within each personality, a sisterly connection remaining firm and strong; storyline is unique within itself (2 episodes were boring but not in its entirety); enjoyable, fun, energetic, among others, overall, one of my very few favorite TV series I love watching."
5,very good season,"Season two is probably one of my favorite seasons. It is better than season one, but not as good as season three. In my opinion the best episodes are witch trial, morality bites, pardon my past, apocalypse not, witch way now, and ex libris. Some of the fun episodes were animal pragmatism and chick flick. I would definately advise you to buy it.Also I love that prue is able to astral project, and my favorite episode was pardon my past, with morality bites coming in a close second."
5,When cartoons didn't contribute to ADD...,"Instead, they taught valuable lessons and were written with care. The 2002 version of the series tried to anime it but failed. An empty clone of the original. The stories bring back so many memories and are now preserved for future generations.One item of note: In the episode ""Dree Elle's Return"" when they were combating the Horn of Evil, the song Orko and Dree Elle sang appears to have been changed. I remember a song there which included the words ""Let the sun shine in"". I could be mistaken as I haven't finished watching the set.Regardless of such a minor detail - He-Man is 80's animation at its best...."
4,Perfect winter tires but don't fit my rims well.,I used these tires on an old school Schwinn wheelset for my winter beater. Whether it was the tires or the rims I'm not sure but they barely fit the rims. Also they don't hook up well and I'm left with the tires bulging out in some areas causing the tire to be out of round. I've had this happen before coincidentally on another pair of Kenda's that were old. I simply replaced them with new Kenda's and had no problems after that. So my problem????? I don't know which is to blame but these tires have a great tread pattern and despite their out of roundness they are great for what I use them for.
2,not impressed,"The Cerwin Vega center I was trying to replace was about a decade old, so I figured that technological improvements over that time-span would let me buy a better speaker for a reasonable price. Although the price is reasonable on this Polk, I was certainly not impressed with the sound produced. ALthough the CV only has one speaker and this Polk has 3 built into it, the sound on the Polk is so much quieter and less crisp. I guess I'll put it in with the tv in my bedroom. It certainly doesn't belong with my 50"" Sony SXRD HDTV, my Harman Kardon receiver, or my JBL speakers.If you're just looking for a fair speaker at a reasonable price, I'd recommend the Polk. But, if you want a center channel that produces strong and crisp sound, you should look elsewhere."
2,Pretty Weak,"Speaker is small and made of plastic. 3"" drivers are weak and not capable or reproducing lower frequencies. If you want full sounding dialog and effects, or deep vocals from your center channel speaker, look elsewhere. I suggest 5"" min. drivers for a center channel speaker. Like another reviewer here, mine ended up being used with a smaller TV in a bedroom. The resonance produced inside the TV cabinet actually improved the sound a bit."
4,AVERAGE GAMER,FOR A PERSON WHO DOESNT PLAY GAMES MUCH AND DOESNT PLAY THEM UNTILE THEY ARE BEAT. THIS GAME IS PRETTY GOOD...U CAN JUST PLAY FOR A BIT THEN NOT TOUCH IT FOR A WEEK OR SO AND PICK RIGHT UP WHERE U LEFT OFF...PLUS IT HAS A CRAZY AMOUT OF CHARACTERS FOR THE BIG COMIC FANS...HOPE THIS IS USEFUL...
5,Spectacular,"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance for Ps2 is a really great game. The only thing that I can say about it that is negative is that after you beat it, the game gets kind of stale. But the graphics, game play, and characters are all great. You have a wide variety of characters to choose from, and each is unique, and offer lots to do."
1,"great game, bad copy",The game came on time in fair condition. It stopped working after only 2 days of light play. The system is new so I don't quite understand.
5,absolutely fabulous book,"this is an amazing book that everyone should read. it really helped me a lot. i'm recovering from subclinical anorexia, and my therapist put me on this diet. using it, i was able to gain weight safely and develop a more psychologically sound relationship with food. i know i'm probably the only reviewer of this book praising it for allowing me to gain weight, but it hasn't been a lot, and i've really learned that fat is NOT the enemy, which i used to think and obsess about. try it. it's wonderful."
3,The Fat Fallacy,This book is well put together and I feel it would work if we had the social habits of the French - and walked much more - I love the idea of not worrying about low-fat or fat-free - all tastes so much better. Feel it will not work 100% because of the American way of life - hurry hurry and eat fast and easy - rare to find a family that eats together and takes time to talk. But willing to give it a try. NH
2,the fat fallacy,"the french diet by same authur much better. it just going round and round same topic, he kept repeating himself. I wanted to say ok get on with your next point."
1,This book is a fallacy....,"Unfortunately the author makes you think that you can eat as much fat as you like without any problems. I think this message is wrong.The author doesn't talk much about excercise which is very important and can stop you from becoming overweight.The book also encourages you to eat foods that are very high in carbs and also high on the glycemic index. Which in my opinion is not a very good idea.French people live a completely different lifestyle compared to others and not all of them are slim. I have seen some fat ones too.The best way to try this method, is to stay in France for a couple of weeks or months.The diet is not very practical either. If I have only 30 mins for lunch at work, how will I be picking at my food for hours?If you are not careful, following the methods in this book will actually make you fatter!"
4,SMOOTH RIDE,"THIS CD IS AN AWESOME COMPILATION OF SOME OF HUGH MASEKELA'S GREATEST SONGS. GO ""GRAZING IN THE GRASS"" AND THEN LISTEN TO SOME OF HIS LESSER KNOWN WORKS. YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED."
5,Simply Awesome!!!,"The calibration of the screen is amazing. The color is astounding and the amount of space to work on is incredible. There's room to view two full sizes pages and palettes with a little room left to spare. The footprint of this amazing monitor is a lot less than my previous 15"" monitor! There's just no turning back after you've test-driven this baby!"
3,"Stunning image, wrong connector",This display isn't compatible with current Powerbooks. An expensive adapter is required.Same adapter is required for any industry standard DVI port.
1,Flimsy construction and can be opened in < 2 seconds,"I purchased one of these units some time ago. After about 4 weeks the electric servo mechanism that opens the internal latch failed to operate, leaving the latch stuck in the closed position and preventing me from using even the key override. Permanently stuck in a closed and locked state. I had to pry the safe door open with screwdriver to recover my firearm (a process that took, amazingly, 45 seconds with a common screwdriver - very soft steel).Also, these safes (at least the model I had) can be opened in under 2 seconds without a key or combo. Make sure you mount them securely so they don't fall and like, hit the ground or anything..."
3,Electronic Pistol Safe,"We ordered 30 of these for our agency. Overall they are solid and will serve our purposes. We had to return one so far for a defective door that would not open properly. The return was quick and easy through Amazon. I do question the security of the battery over-ride if you lose the key and cannot get the code to work. Seems anyone with a 9 volt battery could get into the safe any time. We are thinking about disabling this feature by cutting the wire to avoid unauthorized entry. We will just need to make sure we know where the keys are if the batteries for the electronic lock go dead! I think overall the product offered by Gun Vault is a bit better made, but the price (and free shipping) made these ADG safes the best available for the cost."
1,Not so secure,"Like a few others here, my unit malfunctioned soon after warranty. The electronics still work, but the latch mechanism has lost its strength and can't open the door; the door's spring makes the internal hasp push too hard against the latch for the latch to be able to move out of the way, I assume. If I push the door in slightly while entering the code, it opens. But that is not called functioning for a device of this type. I lubricated it thoroughly and it still could not overcome the friction. Even with new batteries. I suppose I could try to weaken the spring somehow. And, like others here, I am not pleased by the noise of the door when opening.What's more, I saw on an online video that if you tilt this unit and smack it on the floor on its side (left side, if I remember right), it pops right open. There is no mechanism preventing a jolt from the side from opening it, which is pretty short-sighted and irresponsible. An inventor worth his salt would have made a far better device."
1,They Don't Stand Behind It,"I bought this product elsewhere. My mistake, Amazon would have made it right. As it was, when a button stopped working and the safe made random flashes and beeps in response to button pushes and refused to accept a new combination I emailed ADG Sports.Got nothing but a run around. If you try this safe, hope you get a good one. The manufacturer doesn't care if you don't."
4,My oh My!!,"This is definitely one of the best albums I've heard in quite sometime.Mello instrumental stuff, very similar to TRISTEZA. Good stuff here.Especially the song ""GOLDEN CITIES"" Awesome. I haven't come across anyone who doesn't like this album.Buy it, it's totally worth it."
4,Great book for those new to Japanese,"Japanese for Busy People I: Romanized Version is a good starting point for beginners. This was a required textbook for an Introduction to Japanese Course I took and I found it's lessons very helpful. The CD included is a great way to listen to the language and test one's comprehension skills. The one drawback is the romanization. I did not know it at the time of purchase, but new students are better off purchasing the Kana version as soon as they learn Hiragana and Katakana."
3,Just ok,"I was not overly impressed. I love shopping for salvage items and giving them new life. However, although they definitely give some unique and different ideas, it just was not my style. There are definitely better books out there addressing this topic."
3,decorating junkmarket style,"I have been junking for years and thought I would like this book, but was disappointed. There are alot of things in it but not much that I would really consider using as decor in my house. These ladies are talented and have a quirky style- if you are looking for unique items made from found objects , this is for you."
4,Great inspiration for original decorating,"I LOVE this book. For the most part I won't be recreating the exact items featured but (even better) I have been inspired to create my own versions. This concept is fabulous - find a new purpose for old things you find at junk sales or even for things you already own. There are many advantages to these ideas. You can create your own individual look, it is inexpensive, and things that could have gone in the trash get a new life as chic decor. This is a really fun book and is a must have for those who enjoy antique sales, junk markets, or garage sales. It might make you want to clean out your attic. If you have kids these ideas work wonderfully for kids rooms and they can help with many of these types of projects while learning about re-using great old ""junk"" instead of throwing things away to make room for more STUFF."
3,"Excellent source for its price, but lacking content.","For the price, this is a good source. If you are a more advanced spanish-speaker, or speak in a more colloquial form, you won't find many of the words you are looking for. For beginners, it is great."
1,Horrible - toxic chemical smelling bags,"I've ordered these twice. The first time, they were alright and a decent price for the amount of bags you receive. The second order - the smell coming off the bags was horrific! It smelled like bug spray or something toxic - they would stink up the whole room! I returned them hoping for a better batch. NO LUCK! They smell just as bad and my husband had to put them out in the garage. We'll be using them as poop bags for the dog instead of diaper disposal bags. They smell way too strong to put anywhere near the family!"
5,Goodbye Diaper Pail!,"We recently put our house on the market and the last thing I wanted was people coming into the nursery and being met by the scent of a dirty diaper pail. After trying several diaper pails, it was time for a new strategy. We decided to try the bags...they work great!!! I am very happy with them. I will admit, because we are still pretty conscious of odors with the house for sale, we take the bags with the poopy diapers outside to the trash, but the wet ones, we toss into the kitchen garbage. The bags smell great and are very sturdy. I also love the handles, they make it very easy to tie closed. I always keep some in the diaper bag for dirty diapers on the go..and they also work great for storing dirty/wet baby clothes until we get home to wash them. I will never go back to a diaper pail again...ever."
2,Brand Name isn't Necessary,"We received these as a gift once, but quickly learned that we didn't need to buy a well-known name brand to get the same job done. These bags are a great product, but there is really nothing better about them than disposable diaper bags you can buy at $1 stores in packs of 100. There's no need to spend the extra money for something you're going to put stinky or dirty items in."
3,The Diaper Sacks I Used to Love!,These diaper bags used to have a wonderful scent to them. Now it seems like budget cuts have cut the scent in half.
2,Does not hide smell.,"These bags are good for the first two weeks of the baby life. I usually use a plastic grocery bag and double wrap it. This works much better. I would, however, say that they are convenient."
3,"Pretty good, but the smell still escapes","I am sick and tired of smelly diaper pails. I've had a diaper genie & a diaper champ, and no matter what, the smell of poopy toddler diapers seems to penetrate into the plastic and stay with these things long after you empty the pail. I finally took some other reviewers' suggestions, and replaced the diaper-specific pails with a regular trash can with lid that opens when you step on it, and now use these baggies for the poopy diapers, emptying the main bag every few days. The plan seemed to work for a while, but now my new can too seems to have perma-smell. I am now trying to double-bag with these sacks to see if the results are any better. Can't wait until my little guy is fully toilet trained!"
3,kits wlderness,"Kits wilderness is a fantasy book with a touch of magic and some adventure, David Almond who has also written books such as Skellig is the author of Kits Wilderness. The starts of with Kit moving to Stonygate after his grandma has died. He meets up with a boy called John Askew who has two sides to his personality. They play a game, a game called death. Kit and Askew have both got unique talents to explore. Kit encounters many problems as the novel takes many twist and turns. His granpa falls ill and Askw has a grudge against him. The past haunts Kit and goahsts from the past come back.Askew, espacially has a good charachter profile he is a caveman type figuer and has a different reaction to each character. This book would appeal to people of all ages and is well worth a read. I would give this book **** stars out of 5."
3,My Review on Kit's Wilderness,"In my opinion I thought Kit's Wilderness was a bit strange and quite hard to understand. It the beginning when it first introduces the game called ""Death"" and when it first introduces John Askew it was quite mysterious and made you want to read on. .... I thought that was spooky and that also made me want to read on. Towards the end of the book the story began to drag on a bit and in my opinion became a bit boring. Although, I think Almond finished the story well with the ...."
3,Kit's Wilderness Review,"The basic plot was about a group of friends playing a game called death then a teacher at there school finds out and has the den filled up with earth again. Then askew and kit try to play death on their own together, but then allie keenan the good bad ice girl comes and finds them. i like allie best because she has a very funny character. i found the last few chapters least effective because they rushed that part of the story. if i could change any of the story it would be the end, i would say a bit more about how grandpa. that was my review!!!!!!"
2,A complicated fantasy.,"It is a rather hard one to get in to. It manipulates half of the book in preparing for the climax. Finally when the last battle comes the girl simply strolls right to the top of the mountain, holds out her sword, and the enemie is terminated. I expected more of a fight to the end strugle, than a simple distruction.I dare not give this book a one. Even if this story is a rather dull, any one who contributes his thoughts of mind to other people deserves some form of credit."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVERY WRITTEN!!!!,I read this book sometime ago and had to get so I went and bought it. Now I read it a least every two months. I highly recomend you or anyone getting it to read! It is simply amazing!
5,Ruth Rendell - THE MASTER!!,Ruth Rendell is in a class all by herself!!She is the MASTER OF MYSTERIES!!!You can't go wrong with one of her wonderful creations!
4,Gisele,"I enjoyed this book and it simplifies a very complicated subject to a layman's level.It seems far fetched at times, however, I believe medical science is within these realms."
4,Up to date stem cell science,"I was hooked by the plot line involving the latest stem cell technology and that's what kept me turning the pages. The author seems to be a little too concerned about dropping trade names, form Toyota to Science Diet, but clearly he knows his way around this science. The book underlines the promise of the technology but also the ethical dilemmas.I was a little bit annoyed by all of the convenient coincidences required to keep the plot moving."
2,Needs a re-write,"This is a book about stem-cell research,with the main character having stem-cell therapy to cure a defective heart, but ending up with a new body that will never grow older.The book was 92% filler and 8% story. If Aly farted it was described in great detail. Aly seemed to have fairly good character development, Stone not so good. The twist was that Stone's father was the owner of the stem-cell lab. This theme was not developed well. Aly' change took place at the very end of the book and was not developed well.I found this to be an interesting concept, but found the author lacking in science. Also I found the amount of filler boring. I doubt if I would read this author again"
5,Love It!!!,I loved this book! Kathleen E. Woodwiss is an amazing writer and to me this is her best. This was my first book of hers I read and it will not be the last. She does a wonderful job with the characters and storyline. The heroine is a strong woman and the hero is a little mean in the begining but he grows on you as the story goes on.
2,Another one that didn't live up to the rave reviews,"I just couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I saw number of five star reviews and it got me all excited. However, I was sorely disappointed. I couldn't really bring myself to fall for the hero. I saw that he had a bad childhood, but I couldn't get over how insensitive he was. I also could not fathom how the heroine could fall so easily for him after everything her and her parents were put through. I was kind of disgusted with the heroine more than anyone else. I think I am actually being generous with my two star rating, but there were a few good parts. I also hated how the mother didn't reveal the secret sooner, but what do you expect when your daughter is OK with you being cast out of your own house after they kill her hubby! This was just not what I would call a great love story. It was terrible. I do not recommend!!!!"
5,The Wolf and the Dove,I first read this book over 20 years ago. I wanted to re-read it and it did not disappoint. I love the characters and the drama and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading period romantic stories.
2,Kind-of creepy,"If you can get past Meyerowitz rather lame sense of humor, narcissistic anecdotes - and the creepy illustrations - there's some useful information and recipes to be found in this book."
3,Pleasant with some great tracks,"Very pleasant, enjoyable to listen to, with a few really great tracks. It is somewhat repetitive, though, and may pale after a few listens."
4,Conjure One,"Album "";Conjure One""; je akoby pokracovanim prace Delerium s mnozstvom viac ci menej uspesnych pokusov so zvukom, hlasom, hlasmi... Je to dalsie hladanie este dokonalejsich harmonii s pohladom daleko za horizont. Nic vsedne a popritom sa tvariace komercne - hlavne druhe remixove CD. Takze pre fajnsmekrov - doporucujem."
3,Good but not Great,"I am an avid Delerium fan, so when I learned that Conjure One was actually one half of delerium I had to get it. I like about half of the songs on the album. Poe's contributions are fantastic. But some of the other songs are well...repetitive, cliche', boring. I would suggest to spend the money and buy Balligomingo Beneath the Surface, or buy a Delerium album prior to Chimera."
1,Don't buy if you're serious about gun safety....,"2 problems with this safe.- you can't open it when you need to- you can open it when you shouldn't be able toi don't know how many countless times this has gotten stuck when i entered the correct code with new batteries. it makes a sound like it's unlocking, but doesn't. i hit it several times to see if somethings jammed - but nothing. i eventually have to go get my key to open it which works. now THAT'S gonna do me a lot of good when someone is assaulting my wife in the living room. ""ONE SECOND HONEY...LET ME FIND THAT DANG KEY!""the other thing is....if you pick this safe up and drop it - it opens right up. there have even been specials about safety that highlight this safe. anyone could grab this without knowing your combo - walk out the door with it - and drop it a few times to get whatever you keep inside without knowing the code.not a good buy. there are MUCH better safes out there."
5,Reliable seller,"Wang response my question very quickly and friendly. If you want to choose a realiable seller, I recommend her.Good buying experience."
4,Works as expected,"I have the Epson 2200 and this is the only ink I purchase for it. Works consistently, as expected."
3,"There is such a thing as ""too much of a good thing""","All I will say is this. Yes there are goodies in here, but a few klinkers as well. I'd rather just pick the goodies out and buy em separately (some as low as 10 bucks a pop). I have my fair share of these, and when I want more of them, that's what I will do. No need to lay out 4 figures for stuff I will never watch again."
1,confusing!,I was so very disappointed in this software! My 3 year old who enjoys many different types of software and loves Caillou was disappointed. The pathways from one activity to the next is confusing. In the middle of acitvities he would tap a wrong key and end up in some other activity. Don't buy it.
2,Eewww! Round the Rue? Why ever did the author,"include that poem? It's messy and mean while the others I liked - The Cowboy and the Dreamer is just the right touch of wisdom; Huts, Nuts, and Squirrels is sharp and funny; Art is lovely and keen; A Night at Mannions has a captivating cadence; You and I so quietly romantic; Dogs is a very dear expression of the author's humanity and compassion which makes me forgive him Round the Rue. After all, it makes an intriguing title. I would have called it A Night at Mannions or just for us Westerners The Cowboy and the Dreamer and included more of that high caliber story instead of the blah-blah that says sweet nothings, literally. But, let's understand that reading poetry requires a certain reflection and discipline. I'll revisit the poetry another day and see what happens. Sometimes poems find us when we need them."
4,Chrome grips,Bought these for myself liked them so much got a set for my brother. Really helps on long hot rides with hand fatigue make sure you buy the throttle boss as it is very helpful. Hands don't get sweaty or cramp. Easy to install just pay attentionto left and right grips.
4,Grips were great!,"The shipping was great, received the grips quickly. They were excellent - and much cheaper than any motorclcle website I found. The ONLY problem I had was the glue to attach the grips was dried out. I didn't contact the company, because at the point where we discovered the glue was dry, we couldn't wait to a replacement or we would be waiting without a bike! We had a tube of super glue, so it worked out fine."
4,good grips but a little loose,I just installed these on my '99 650 Vstar. They look amazing. the only reason i didnt give this a 5 star review is that they aren't quite as snug as i would like to see. they wiggle around a little. Not much but more then the stock grips.
4,Another light-hearted mystery!,"Annie and Max Darling are two of the most appealing modern-day sleuths out there, and the setting in Broward's Rock can't be beat. I read these mysteries for the characters, both old and new. I do really enjoy reading another book in the series because I want to keep up with the people on Broward's Rock. This book is set around the annual White Elephant's Sale held by the Women's club. It always sounds like such fun on Broward's Rock! Annie and Max are again on the heels of a cool, caclutating murderer, but the book introduces some other unsavoury topics such as blackmail, mercy killing, extra-marital affairs and robbery. So much in one book! But that's what these books are like. They are wonderful light reading, and I love the many allusions to other mystery novels salted throughout the book. A wonderful book for cozy lovers."
2,simplistic,"I find this author very simplistic. It seems it would be good for a young reader: simple language and not too challenging. For adults? I'd think adults would get impatient with the overly simple writing. I'm a big mystery fan, and tried a couple of her DoD series, but they're SO immature. Geeze, Encyclopedia Brown is more complex!"
5,Works,"It's a vacuum bag! If this size bag fits in your vacuum, then you should buy it. Much cheaper than in the stores"
5,K&N 57-3023-1 kit on 2001 Tahoe 5.3,"Take off improved a noticeable difference right away. I recommend this product. I had just the K&N filter before I installed this cold air kit, I should have just bought the cold air kit first. I recommend it enough that I will be buying one for my wife's 2004 Tahoe soon. Easy install, took me an hour on my 2001, only had to drill one hole; no cutting needed for it. Hope this helps, good luck."
1,ERR 2,"I bought this coffee maker 3 weeks ago. I keep getting ERR 2, which means, the coffee maker will no longer work! What a waste of time and money!!"
1,Dont buy!!,"This is the worst kitchen aid appliance Ive ever owned, coffee is never hot enough, over flose, coffee grinds everywhere and leaks. Ive always bought Kitchenaid appliances however Iam now done with them although six months ago I purchased a high end gas stove that is kitchenaid now Iam worried about that.My coffee maker lasted almost two years now today the coffee maker reads error2 I call kitchen aid and Jessica says to unplug the machine and if that doesnt work (in which it did not) its the warming plate and there is nothing to be done for it. Iam buying a NEW ONE TODAY not kitchen aid I ve heard Mr. coffee makes the best maybe Ill try the cheaper brands this time and maybe high end appliances are just that your paying for the brand not how good the product really is"
1,"Just an ""update""","This book is merely an ""update"" of Dockery's first book on SEAL weaponry. The publisher was even too lazy to correct error and omissions from the first book..."
4,Great for Newcomers,"As a newcomer to Houston, I thought this book was a great introduction to all the neat things to do in the area. Rather than spend time looking it all up on the internet, I have a great guide right in front of me. I like it!"
3,"Meet Valeria Foret, a modern day lesbian Indiana Jones.","Archeologist Valerie Foret has spent a fruitless year searching for a tomb in the Egyptian desert--a year where the only excitement has been provided by her secret trysts with a woman she might have been safer avoiding. When she finally makes the discovery of a lifetime, she is immediately set upon by a jealous colleague who intends to usurp her find, fundamentalists of all faiths who feel threatened by the truths she has uncovered, and strange forces that may be not quite of-this-world. For what she's found is a glimpse into the hereafter, and it's nothing like it's supposed to be. Follow the adventures of an unforgettable heroine and embark on an incredible desert odyssey with Book One of the Ibis Prophecy: The 100th Generation."
4,Time's Fancy Review,"This is an excellent book of poetry, one of Wallace's finer works. Wallace is a native of Wisconsin, and in being so, includes many images of the rural Wisconsin lifestyle which folks from the area will especially appreciate. His use of imagery in his prose appeals to so many of the senses. Things we experience in everyday life go from mundane to extraordinary with his usage of extended metaphors. Particular favorites include the following poems ""Astronomy of Loss"", ""Beethoven and the Birds"", ""Dragonflies"", ""Quick Bright Things"", ""Possum, 1942""."
1,beware JHU White Papers,"content is ok, but their marketing practices are shady, nasty & aggressive. You're liable to end up being mailed & billed things you didn't want & dunned. If you complain, they just get nastier. I can't understand why a reputable scholarly & medical institution would contract with publishers with such bad business practices."
2,"normaly I love Brit shows, not this one","Didn't like it, I was pretty jazzed by the description, however I found this show to be slow and boring."
4,Keeps Coffee Hot. Works great if you use care,"The coffee stays hot for a long time. Have to figure out how to use it properly. The coffee maker will not work if the lid of the carafe is not screwed on properly, but it won't go in unless you do. Broke the cheap plastic filter piece the first day (but that isn't a big deal). You should place something under the carafe otherwise it will slip out of the slot since it is free from the coffee maker. This stops the brewing process. My wife used the non slip shelf liner and it worked great. Makes great coffee."
3,"makes great coffee , BUT......","THIS MACHINE MAKES A REALLY KICK BUTT CUP OF COFFEE - THE DESIGN IS NICE TOLOOK AT ( A FEW CLUNKY FEATURES LIKE FILLING THE WATER SIDE OF IT), HOWEVER - IT SEEMS TO HAVE THIS ISSUE OF THE LID POPPING OPEN WHILE IT IS MAKING COFFEE - SPEWING HOT WATER ACCROSS THE COUNTER AND ROOM AND DOES NOT SHUT OFF DURING THIS EPISODE. SO, NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT WITH THIS MACHINE TO HANG OUT NEARBY UNTIL IT IS FINISHED, IN CASE IT OPENS UP WHILE BREWING.I REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEM IS A DESIGN ISSUE - THERE IS A SMALL METAL CLIP/LATCH THAT HOLDS THE TOP DOWN - THE HOT WATER PASSES NEAR IT OR ON IT WHILE BREWING - I CAN ONLY ASSUME THE HEAT CAUSES SOME CONTRACTION/EXPANSION ISSUE WITH THE LATCH CAUSING IT TO POP OPEN.PERHAPS I GOT THE LEMON OF THE BUNCH.BESIDES THIS, IT IS A GOOD MACHINE FOR THE MONEY!ROBSANTA FE, NM"
1,awkward counter hog,"A joke! Takes up a huge amount of space and makes mediocre coffee. Makes more noise than any coffee maker I've ever had. A ostentatious appliance that demands to be seen and heard. I made a ""huge"" mistake buying this!"
4,Wonderful,I bought this recording on cassette some ten years ago when I lived in Tel-Aviv and heard Sunita play at a weekly Friday morning arts fair. A lyrical (no pun intentended) musical experience that spans 2 continents and cultures seemlessly.
5,Early book with lots of easy reading,"Manny's first book on Fluorescent minerals and a great read. Not as technical as his later book, but good stories about the mines and the miners. I am the author of ""Collecting Fluorescent Minerals"" and I really enjoyed learning from this book. It is expensive because it is out of print, but if you are serious about collecting Fluorescent Minerals, then this should be in your library (along with my book which is due out by June, 2004)"
5,Wow,"If you haven't read this book yet, then read it now! I fell into this series. If you read Anne Rice, then you will most likely like this series. I have always enjoyed vampire novels, but these stand out. I suggest that if you like the dark, decadent vampiric themes, then either start reading this series or read Anne Rice."
1,the hundred years war trial by battle,"the title says trial by battle but never once does any battle ever rate more then one or two sentences. this book is very slow. If you are looking for the total history of this conflict and era including the armour,weapons and battles hence the title the hundred years war trial by battle, this is not the book for you."
2,Dated!,I don't know if I received the wrong version from the seller or what but this is a 2nd edition copy rather than 7th. The language and information is very dated.
5,Great,"This is by far the best puzzle I have ever worked on, quality is great, very satisfied with this product"
3,too hard and too big,My eyes hurt trying to find pieces to fit together. I had to give up because it was not fun anymore. I also needed my dining room table back.
4,Fun Puzzle,"This puzzle was fun to put together. It is very large, and took some time. It is a bit challenging, mostly due to its size and the amount of pieces it has. After it was completed, it made for a great puzzle to frame and hang in the hallway."
4,"Good Stuff, Go See Them Live","The album is good, the live show is even better. Listen to the album and then see how they translate the songs live. Good stuff."
3,This is a play not a movie,I chose to watch this because of Kelitta Smith and Drew Sedora. I was very surprised to find out it was a play not a movie. Not what I bargined for. It was an okay show. the acting was not all that spectacular.I would only recommend it if you are just trying to pass the time.
3,She's Not My Sister,"This movie offers a good story and has it's moments. Not the type of movie you would rush out to the theater to see. I enjoyed it, but it will be a while before I see it again."
3,I would rate higher but....,"This dictionary is comprising of primarily Christian signs, and therefore should be mentioned that this dictionary is specific to that faith, not as all-encompassing as Christianity is not the only religion out there, and so just broad-blanketing the label of religious signs does lend itself to the implied notion that the only religion acknowledged is the included text? Church/temple, does not only speak to one faith, and worship is not comprised of only one faith's view of it. That clarification should be clearly stated, and also that it does bring to light the absence of attention of the resources out there giving attention to other religions outside of the Judeo-Christian faith. That lack of attention to other faiths, means that religious tolerance and acknowledgement or knowledge of other religions by Deaf people is by reflection... and implication, absent and marginally seen. Thoughts?For Christian signs, good collection of signs, thankyou."
1,Preview content is useless (Kindle),"The Preview should include 1) an index/TOC so I can see what signs this book contains, 2) a few pages that contain actual signs so I can get a feel for how they're displayed, the artwork, etc. The current preview contains only the Cover (which I can already see) and the introductory text, which is useless in helping me decide if this would be a useful item on my Kindle."
4,can't wait for the full length,"Heard Black Cab on my satellite radio once a few weeks ago. Loved it so I found more Jens on his Secretly Canadian website. From the sound of the single from this EP and Rocky Dennis Farewell from the first EP, this is a talent we will all see more of soon. Has hints of Sufjan Stevens, a young Leonard Cohen, and a early 90s REM from Automatic for the People and Out of Time. A bit more low-key than his fellow scandinavian and breakout artist Sondre Lerche."
5,My favorit deodorant,"I have used Fa for many years, and have been very satisfied with their whole line of beauty products."
1,The Shadow-Behind The Mask,"I really like actor, Kane Richmond, but this is one bad movie.I mean everything about this movie is bad, the story, acting etc.Also this is a home made copy. Very poor picture quality."
5,Through Indian Eyes,"Beautiful book, beautiful pictures and a world of information on Native Americans! Buy it, you'll love it!"
1,Dont do it!,"I own a franklin translator but wanted to know how to say the words so I purchased this translator. The audio for this translator is HORRIBLE, and some of the translations were not correct! After 5 minutes of playing with this translator I was on the phone getting a return code so I could send it back. So please whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS TRANSLATOR!!! I wouldnt pay $10 for it! It's garbage."
2,"Beware, this edition does not teach you Kana","I am taking a class which says that as part of the class we will be learning Kana. The class descriptions says buy the third edition of Japanese for Busy People so I assumed I should get the ""Kana"" edition. Oh no! This edition assumes you already know Kana. I guess there must be some people learning Japanese who already know the script but I'm not one of them. Of course, returning to Amazon was pretty easy, I just lost out on the shipping costs and created a delay in my having the book I need."
5,Awesome graphics!,"The illustrations in this book are exceptional. There are so many 3-D details from the life-like expressions on the characters' faces (Iggy's face as he's trying to reinflate hot dogs with a bicycle pump is priceless!)to the crumbs of cheese on Gruntly's workshop floor to the labels on the jars of Iggy's buggy bits. The story line is entertaining and has a good message about the importance of working together to achieve goals, yet it isn't preachy nor does it talk down to kids. And there is just the right amount of grossness to really appeal to kids (stinky toes, bug parts, dirty socks). It's the kind of book you can read over and over and not get tired of, because you find something new each time. I bought one for my neice and my co-worker's son."
1,DO NOT BUY,We have had this bike under 1 year. All 4 pedals have broken at least twice. Parts loosen up all the time. I wish I had sprung for a better quality bike.
2,Ultimately Disappointed,"I purchased two of these receivers. One still functions fine, but causes a distinct hum in my speakers, regardless of input. The second one causes the same hum and the speaker switches are broken after a year of use (and now out of warranty.)If you are looking for a standalone receiver, spend the extra $$ and get a real receiver. This one is barely passable."
3,"While still formulaic, it has some of the better dialog in the ""Tek"" series","In this installment of the Tek series, Jake Cardigan and Sid Gomez are tracking down the conspirators that managed to create a fake video that shows their boss, Walt Bascom killing a man. The trail is varied, parallel when the two split up and involves Bascom's daughter Kacey. Her involvement generates the best dialog in the book, as some of the banter between Kacey, her father and Jake is humorous. Another high point is when Gomez meets with an old friend, a sharp shooting stripper named Marney. Following the formulaic nature of the Tek books, a Tek cartel is behind the difficulties, people are routinely killed and at the end Jake and Sid shoot it out with the bad guys.This is one of the better books in the Tek series, the dialog has a little more style and humor and the plot moves a little better. However, this is still one of the books that you read in bed late at night to tuck your mind away for the evening."
1,Another attempt to cash in on Elvis's fame,"I'd be surprised if Lucy ever actually met Elvis. If Elvis was so in love with Lucy, then why did he have another girlfriend at the time? Not to mention, Lucy isn't mentioned in any reliable book on Elvis, yet his main girlfriends are. Odd, isn't it?"
3,Good Book,"When I firsr bought this book I thought it was a story, but I found out that the author is criticizing what women do in their lives. It's pretty funny though. Nice to read on the beach."
5,So helpful!!,"This book is WONDERFUL! Its packed full of incredibly useful information and tools to get your child to sleep independently. Since my son was a co-sleeper from day 1, it was incredibly difficult to move him to his own bed, in his own room. Following some of the tips from this book, he is now well on his way to being able to sleep alone. I strongly recommend this book. Yesteray I bought him a fish (one of the tips in the book) for his room to ""keep him company at night."" He did so well, and even after he woke up this morning, he wanted to stay in his bed to talk to his fish. If I had read this book before I tried moving him to his own room, I think things would have gone a lot smoother, but we are on the right track now."
1,Keep Looking!,"Yes, these are great little toys, but the paint chips quite readily when played with by a little kid! DON'T pay big bucks for something you can find with a little footwork for $4.00 + local tax and stimulate your local economy, not the scalpers!"
4,Great Introductory Pool Video.,"Great introductory pool video. Introduces the game for important points to be learned and seriously practiced by new players with demonstrations about the ""art"" of a great game by true masters. Highly recommended."
3,A fascinating story...,"I attacked this novel voraciously when a copy fell into my hands. Having seen the movie years ago and recently read Eugenides' novel Middlesex, I was prepared to be blown away and left with a haunted, unanswered feeling... For the first fifty pages, though, I have to admit my only thought was that it made a much better movie than it did a novel. The deeper I got into the story, however, the more the writing redeemed itself. The minute details of the forced communal living of a suburban neighborhood surfaced again and again to keep what would otherwise be an extremely gloomy story light. This is one of those rare cases, in my opinion, where the movie and novel are equally well done, and do equal justice to the story told."
4,"Creepy, haunting read","I only read this after seeing the film starring Kirsten Dunst, which made my skin crawl, although it was excellent. It's the story of 5 Catholic sisters, growing up in 1970's Michigan. They live in the midst of a wealthy neighborhood, though their bumbling, out-of-touch father is only a math teacher at their parochial high school. Their mother is a strict, religious parent, and treats her girls like she's training them for the convent. All 5 girls are beautiful, blond and objects of desire for the neighborhood boys, and the middle sister, racy Lux, leads them on. Then one night, thirteen-year-old Cecilia, the youngest, commits suicide, and the family is never the same again. The parents will not allow the other four sisters to overcome the death of their sister and live normal teenage lives, and it proves to be the downfall of all the girls. The story is told from the point of view of one of the neighborhood boys, and it is a very interesting, if creepy and depressing, read."
3,this book is disturbing.,"regarding the kirkus review, whoever wrote that is mistaken. cecilia was the youngest daughter, not the eldest."
2,"Interesting at points, but never hit its higher goal...","I actually enjoyed the movie much more. The book strived for philosophical, and ended as an obsesssive rant...the comedy totally missed me, and it hung as a black cloud in my things-to-finish list."
4,page turner,"All you need to know of the storyline of this book is written in the first paragraph, which sets the scene. You know there are five sisters who, by the end of the book, will exist no more.All the pages inbetween are detailed almost as if the boy narrating the story has become a detective in later life. His knowledge of the details surrounding the girls is thoroughly researched and documented.Even though you know the ending of the story it is still engrossing, searching for the 'whys' and 'hows'."
2,writing style just not for me,"So the plot is very interesting. I was desperate to find out the whys around these girls.But the writing style was just not for me. The author has a very descriptive style and at times I found myself aggravated by the pages and pages of descriptions of the weather, the seasons, the bugs, and the leaves. I just wanted the plot to move forward.And finally big spoiler alert you get no real answers for why this happened to these girls in this small town......irritating!"
5,I think people are missing something,This is one of the most beautiful and captivating books I have ever read. I see a lot of complaints that the story is about the boys and that makes the girls seem one dimensional . . . THATS THE POINT . . . thats whats wrong with the girls is how they are seen . . .
3,"VERY entertaining, but what is the point?","I had a great time while I was reading this book, but it the kind of book that makes you look at yourself and ask the question, ""why am I reading this, and putting myself through this?"" The story conveys its emotions very well, and you feel the pain of the characters, but there is no real point to it all. Yes, some families are very disfunctional, we already know this. All things considered, don't take my word for it, the story is enjoyable enough for you to read it, and draw your own conclusions to this mysterious and different book."
5,A Wonderfully Compeling Story,"The Vigin Suicides is a wonderfully compelling story beautifully written by first time novelist Jeffery Eugenides. The story of the five Lisbon sisters and their emerging suicides is told by the unnamed neigbor boys that loved them from a distance. Taking place in an era distictively 70's, yet not completely recognized, only adds to the wonderful mystery of this book. The story is engaging and interestingly told as the boys watch and try to reach out to the Liston girls( apparently unaware of the boy's affections) and then as the boys look back on what could have been the possible motives for the terrible demise of these beautiful girls. The character's are beautifully contrived and complex and have an aura of the mysterious surrounding them, which only makes the book more of a page turner. Adolesence and many of its obsticles are interestingly portrayed to which all readers can realate, along with many feelings distant to many people in in this world"
4,"A Journey Into Suburban Mythos, But....","From the very first paragraph, even from the title, we know what happens: five beautiful sisters commit suicide. The question is, why? The answers are sought, in retrospect, from the point of view of the men who were once teenage boys obsessed with these girls. Eugenides' lyrical, entrancing prose creates a fascinating world within the minds of the boys, and in the process involves the reader in a long lost, innocent suburban world that only ever existed in retrospect. However, what seems so mysterious to the boys, i.e. the reason for the girls' seeming madness and subsequent suicide, is blindingly obvious to the reader, and some of the plot twists seem completely unrealistic and even superfluous. It's a book I enjoyed reading once, but not something I'll pick up again."
4,Wow,"THis book was a good book on a very hard subject. It was a little depressing, and hard to read at some points in the story. It would be very tragic if something like the story of the Lisbon girls really did happen. I think the author did a good job writing about a very difficult subject. I recommend this book to people who like to read and don't get depressed by books very easily."
2,A wierd book that is pretty depressing,>>A weird book that I find hugely difficult to describe any further than the title. Except that one of them is not a virgin.<<Exactly my sentiments! Would not recommend this book unless you want to be depressed and bored to death by a bunch of boy teens who have nothing better to do than spy on some girls.
1,Pulitzer pseudo literature,"I should have known. When a novel (or its author) has Pulitzer Prize status, chances are good I'm not going to like it, and so The Virgin Suicides proved to be the rule and not the exception. It's the usual dirty, creepy, weird, dark, perverted mess that passes for ""serious literature"" today. As for the characterization of the Lisbon girls and their parents, nothing about their personalities or character was developed beyond the most surface of observable actions, so who could bond with them? As for their admirers, the ""we"" of the narrators, the same can be said about them, and there is, in addition, nothing in the realm of realism to suggest why the admirers would ever have developed crushes on these bizarre sisters. I found myself not ever caring about anyone in the entire book. However, I could clearly ""smell"" the decay he insisted we experience, or was that my own brain decaying under the trauma of trying to absorb this miasma of storytelling?"
4,"eerie, mesmerizing story of adolescence and tragedy","When I found out Sophia Coppola's first film is an adaption of Eugenides' novel, I became curious and read the book. I'm glad I did. It's easy to become rapt in the narrator's recollection of the Lisbon sisters -- the girls who tantalized, tortured, befuddled, frustrated, and awed those around them. A strong sense of place and sensual detail draws the reader in; you virtually join the neighborhood boys and try to make sense of the girls and what becomes of them. This is a unique book, because it evokes Cather, Fitzgerald, and Salinger instead of the hokey Gen-X self-involvement of most '90s American fiction. I'm interested in seeing how Coppola translates the book into film. Read this book, and read Jamison's non-fiction study of youthful tragedy, ""Night Falls Fast""; Jamison's examination of suicide, complete with real-life accounts, will augment the sadness -- and eerieness -- of Eugenides' tale."
3,The Virgin Suicidesp,I found this book kept my attention. Though the story was very improbable and I did not understand what the author wanted the reader to take away from the story
2,Poorly crafted,"Although Mr. Eugenides tries to carefully craft the characters of the Lisbon sisters, he leaves much to be desired in crafting the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon. Very little is said to or about the couple who have lost five daughters. Our book club (about 16 members) read this and the majority feel this book was not a good read. A few people really liked the book, but more felt that the book was a very slow read. Many of the tangents that Mr. Eugenides went off on did little to contribute to the story line."
3,Not that impressed,"I purposely waited to watch the movie (and yet to do so) until after I read this book but I think even seeing the trailers to the movie changed my perspective on what the book would be about. I didn't realize the point of view would be of the boys from across the street, and I gotta tell you, I was left wanting a lot more.I know part of the intrigue of this book is that you're left with unanswered questions, but in the end I felt a little cheated. I would have enjoyed hearing the girls' thoughts and really known what went on in the house. It was an ok read. I enjoyed it overall, but really didn't get much out of the book.I'm probably in the minority here so take my criticism with a grain of salt. This was just my 2 cents."
1,A Great Sleeping Pill. Hope its flammable,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon.com, and after reading the great reviews, I could not wait to dig in. I am glad there are books for anyone;s taste, but this book was consistently boring. I have ordered many books which I have enjoyed on the recommedations found at Amazon.com, but I am saving this one to start a fire next winter."
3,Missing something...,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed after reading this book. I went in with lofty expectations, so perhaps I was setting myself up for it. While ""The Virgin Suicides"" is very well written it is never as compelling as it should be, as it probably could have been (Eugenides seems very capable of writing compelling literature). I never really saw why the boys were so obsessed with the Lisbon girls, aside from their seclusion. And in the end I was unsatisfied with the mystery the Lisbon girls left behind. Obviously since the boys narrating the story would not have had an adequate explanation it is impossible for us to expect one - but a little more insight into what drove the girls toward their inevitable demises would have been appreciated. I guess that's the point - no one would ever know what it felt like for them, but it still doesn't leave you satisfied."
2,Tedious exercise in magic realism,"The author has chops but VS is a let down. Instead of character and plot development, the book offers a tedious exercise in ""magic realism"", or how many tragi-comic, ironic, goofy, voyeuristic, farfetched, twisted scenes can the author pile up before you heave the book into the nearest trash can?"
5,Into a Different World,"Ive read this book a number of times, and each time its gets better. Every time you read a page,whether it be for the first time, or the third, you come across Euginides' dark humor and tremendous talent for bringing the Lisbon daughters to life through his own wit, and imagination. The mystery of the five young sisters launches the reader into a world of dreams, desires, permiscuity, and tragedy. This book gives you a new vision of true love, and tragic loss. Through euginides' descriptions of the life, or rather imprisonment of the girls, you can feel every emotion that passed through their subconcious. All at once, you understand being a woman, and being in love with one. This wonderfully morbid first novel expresses Jeffrey Euginides' genius to its full extent."
2,Suicides: A great subject for a novel,"A friend asked me to go see the author when he came here to Houston. I thought he sounded very interesting so, I immediately orederd his 1st two books, The Virgin Suicides & Middlesex (from amazon.com, natch). Suicides was a r-e-a-l slog, but I was determined to get through it. I did, but I really cannot reccommend it. I've now got Middlesex to get through (it won the Pulitzer Prize) & things do not bode well."
3,Fun idea but lacking in substance.,"A lot of the cover reviews etc. for this book were along the lines of intense and spell bounding but I just didn't see it. The novel takes a relatively simple, small story, throws in some Fargo type dark humor, an interesting narrator, and ends up as though it were dragging you through some awful carnival exhibit. While the story itself, the strange suicide of five sisters, is very interesting and deserving of being told, I think it completely lacks impact or serious drama to keep the reader going. I found myself desperately just trying to get it over with. If you're looking for some creative writing and witty remarks then this is it. On the other hand if you want something dramatic, gripping, poignant, or even revealing then just skip it. Don't believe the reviews on the back of the book."
1,We will rock you?,"Never has this phrase been uttered with such absence of conviction. Even a child can sense the inherent impetus to shout it out with a growl: WE WILL ROCK YOU! But, no -- here it is lazily chimed in a sing-songy manner that leaves me disgusted. Ciara, you don't know the meaning of ROCK."
3,Let me See You..,"...One Two StepCiara has been crowned the Queen of Crunk, a fresh new theme of music which has music fans in its grip now more than ever! Ciara has come at us with her new single One Two Step and it should leave you stepping out to buy it!The track has a funky off beat feel to it, and full of crazy collections of beats techo vibes and instruments! It is so raw and so confusing along with the vocals it leaves you wanting to get on that dance floor and do the song justice! The vocals from Missy are slow and calms the pace down and then its Ciaras job to get it back up with her fresh voice and style. All in all a deifnate single to buy and enjoy!"
4,Product 72178 Wenger Mens Watch.,"The Watch in terms of Quality and Perfomance, I love it. I give 4.5 stars overall deal.A little disapointment to later find the shippnig was only to within the U.S. I got the order through a frind in the U.S."
3,Too little,"It was not at all obvious that this ""book"" was only 2 inches square. I almost threw it out with the packaging. The content is cute but I cannot figure out why it is published in such a tiny format. I guess I'm not familiar with Annikins."
4,very white,"If you are afraid of color, this book is for you. Don't let it convince you, though, that french country is not about bold colors- every other book I've seen says the opposite. That said, it is a beatiful book, with lots of rustic elements."
1,14804 Sears Kenmore Humidifier Replacement Filter,This product was horrible. I purchased two to get us through the next few months and neither filter lasted longer than a week. The issue is that it looks like they are put together with some type of glue gun or something. The glue melted into the humidifier basin so there was a white film in it. Then the filter itself formed a goopy barrier (again the glue) where it hit the water in the humidifier which blocked the filter from working at all anymore.Just horrible.
3,Not a absorbent as the genuine article.,"At first the wicks worked OK, but after a little while I noticed that they did not conduct the water quite as well. It took almost 12 hours to hydrate two gallons of water in a 15% relative humidity 600 Sq. Ft. area. They can be made to work better by submerging them when they dry out. They just don't wick the way I think they should. Maybe the materials used or something."
2,Disappointing,"This wick filter has an inherent design flaw that preventswater from the humidifier tray to saturate the top three inchesof the filter pad, therefore no humidity gets introduce into theair. Product link [...]"
3,Questions repeated,"I reason I give 3 stars is because, there were a few questions got that repeated under different sections. This is not what the description of the books says.Looks like this was done to score 201 questions."
4,Golly Gee a Feejee,Not many pictures in this book - but lots of words - good words.The subject is handled with respect - which is not always done with topics such as this. The photos and illustrations are not reproduced very well so don't buy it for the pictures. There are some good essays and it reads fast. I have studied this topic for many years so I was prepared for the worst - meaning i wouldn't find much new stuff here - but hey I DID. New info about some old things I have been studying always impresses me and tells me that the writer(s) did their homework.
2,It wasn't what I was looking for,"This book seems to be more like an explanation on causes of memory loss than a practical guide to revert them. It does have some advice on it, but is not the bulk of the book. Besides it seems more intuitive than medical. I feel it didn't brought any new to me."
5,Wow!,"I bought Visions of Atlantis' first cd, and although it was good, it didn't thrill me. Then I heard that they changed male vocalists and I bought their new one. I'm glad I did. This cd rocks! There isn't a song I don't like and the girl has a wonderful voice. So does the guy, who is ten times better then the first one, in my opinion. I am a huge fan of Nightwish, and this band is really one of the only ones who comes close, not to compare them or anything. Totally awesome!! Also, Emppu Vuorinen from Nightwish does a guitar solo on Realm Of Fantasy."
1,"Adopt International, Misinformation","In the very beginning of this book, the authors state that people older than 45 years of age will probably not be able to adopt. This information is doing children around the world, desperately waiting for a family, a huge disservice. How awful that this false information is in a best selling book. People up to age 60 can easily adopt, as can singles, the handicapped, homosexuals, and people with large families. Much of the information is also borrowed from the not-for-profit book, ""The Report on Intercountry Adoption"", which is updated yearly. I could have been done a lot better. Martha Osborne Editor, Rainbow Kids.com"
4,Academic Support,"THe dictionary is excelent, specially to resolve urgent dudes. I recomend improve the figures and add more ones."
1,What are they teaching in school?,"This book shows the laziness in students learning basic physics. Secondly it shows someone unwilling to do the reasearch of the equipment that is all over the internet. Finally, why should we assume things like lighting on the moon are so sinister. Personally I haven't been in an airless environment and how it affects ther perspective of mountains miles away. Send the author a science book!"
2,Good points but not for everyone,"A great read. Very thought provoking. However, I was taught from a very young age that you never, ever casually open someone else's refrigerator and take food without asking. It doesn't matter if its the refrigerator of close family or your best friend. It's bad manners and very disrespectful. So the idea of ""Refrigerator Rights"" doesn't resonate with me AT ALL. Though the points in this book make sense in today's world, not everyone enjoys being around a lot of people and that doesn't mean such people are ""limited"" in how much enjoyment they get out of life. I took exception to the author's apparent belief that self-reliance is bad. You can't always lean on others."
1,What a waste of time and money,"As someone involved in the consulting area for many years, I was unable to find any new idea that would make worthwhile to spend money in this book. Almost everything that is mentioned here can be grabbed from free articles availables in Internet,about this subject. Additionally, there are a good number of books that will help you much more to plan and implement ERP's. Last, but not least, the book only have a handful of small pictures and tables. Unacceptable for a modern book about business and technology topics."
3,"Good show, bad packaging","I give it a 3/5 just because of the fact that the show is good. I have had the 1st season for a long time and I am just now getting this second season. I watched this when i was younger so It is a good continuation from the 1st season. 1st season is best in my opinion so far.The bad:What's up with the horrible packaging of the discs? Maybe its because this is a old show and packaged back then, but it is from my experience that have the discs on top of each other like that isn't the brightest and most consumer friendly way of holding the discs. 2 of the discs will not even stay in place! They keep falling out. Thank goodness that there is an outside box that you slide off because the discs would just fall right out when I pick the product up. Its also silly having to take a disc to be able to put one behind it.Good season, bad packaging. 3/5"
5,VM is the best! Watch one and you'll be hooked,"I love Veronica Mars, and I actually started watching it after it was in the third season. Since then, I've watched every episode at least three times! Its great."
3,"Good Series, Bad Product",The series was great. I really enjoyed watching the episodes. My problem was that 2 of the 6 DVDs were defective. Disc 3 froze during several episodes and disc 5 had episodes where I could only hear the audio. The screen would go black for several minutes at a time. I bought the series new to avoid getting a DVD that didn't play. Next time I'll just buy it at the store.
5,Best show ever!!!,I love this show. This season was heart-pounding and tied right in with the last season. I completely recommend it and suggest it to anyone. Kristen Bell is a laugh out loud actress. She is so witty and smart. I think every girl wants to be just like Veronica Mars.
1,Gasp!,I cannot tell you how disgusted I was with this show! It stars a very cute girl Kirsten Bell. Thats not the bad part. In the very first episode was shocking. A gang talks shockingly to her and she is not even the least disturbed about it! Instead she talks disgustingly back at them! The show continues to be incredibly sleezy for a teen show! I must advise you not to by this set or the first season. Instead by the series of Monk. A few episodes are bad but I have never seen anything this bad! I hope that someday a studio will make an appropriate show!
3,Comic timing + Boy genius = solid (if formulaic) read,"Barry Ween is a very disturbed, very intelligent ten year old, with a penchant for experimentation and a secret desire to rule the world. Unsurprisingly, this particular stereotype feels a little bit exhausted.Still, as a story-telling device, there's surprisingly little you can't fit into the set-up. And, even in the first three issues, Winick shows off his ability to think (very) creatively using the Boy Genius as his foundation.Barry Ween also shows off a talent for comic-strip comedic timing - panels without dialog or action are a common occurrence as Winick sets up a punchline. The art supports this neatly, although, to be fair - it does little else."
5,Ex-Whitecross Singer Makes A Christian AOR Classic!!!,"As a huge fan of Whitecross in the 80's I was sad to see Scott Wenzel go solo. Rex Carroll (Whitecross guitarist) wanted to go in a different musical direction so he left. But to my surprise this CD really impressed me. It is different from Whitecross in that is is more like Night Ranger, Survivor & journey than Ratt. Believe me this cd has no fillers. It is the album that Scott Wenzel wanted to make. Every song is a highlight but my favorites are: Heart On Fire, Sarah, Are You Faithful & You Gave Everything (which is the perfect ending to this cd). Do not miss this cd it is awesome!!!"
5,Great book for any age,"I thought that this was a great book to read, and it kept me hooked. I got this book in 2nd or 3rd grade, and still read it in 11th grade."
5,I Beg Your Pardon?,"Each time someone in the book asks, ""I beg your pardon?"" I tumble into hysterics. This is the result of cleverly built up dialogue that becomes funnier with each fragment of repartee.Who cares about the plot? This author is a genius who could solve all the problems of the world with his wonderfully optimistic and forgiving attitude, and a humor that is on the par with the very best comedy writers (even exceeding them). I had to stop reading at times to prevent myself from strangling on my own convulsive laughter. Have mercy, Parnell. If you had been any funnier, I'd have gladly died laughing."
2,"He says, she says.","Much dialogue back & forthing, thin in the mystery dept. Never read Parnell Hall before & I love cozies but I wanted more from an award winning writer. This is my opinion, others may love it."
4,excellent book,"Great book on beginning sailing. I had sailed for a year before I read this book, and still learned a lot. It has good information on some of the finer technical points of sailing that you would probably not learn by just doing (sailing). Explains topics well in a very understandable fashion."
4,Great!!,"I liked this book but sometimes it was a little too much about other characters from the first books in this series and I didnt feel like I got a complete story for the main characters. If you take out about the past characters and skip the ""who-done-it"" shenanagans- there isnt enough juicy romance between the two. It was a good read, but it wasn't good enough to read again. This author has brought us better than this before and I will buy more by her again. But I still feel that this couple was a little jipped and their story could have been so much more interesting. I wont be buying any more ""last of the series"" books by her again--I will read it at the library where I can return it and it wont collect dust."
4,Very funny and sweet,This book is a must read for those of you who love to laugh. I could not but this book down. If you do get to read it enjoy!!!!!!!
2,Wasn't dat great,"Diz dvd was alright not all dat great what realy saved it was scenes from blackthought from the roots rhymin about random thangz & the mosdef scene other then dat ? Freestyle was pretty boring. They focus 2 much on supernat insted of focusing on the better onez and why wasnt redman on this dvd ? The vets of this like some one said befo kool k, tribe,REDMAN,kurupt, krs etc... Supernat is brilliant at wut he doez, dont get me wrong but he's not the best. Watch rhyme & reason , the mc, and scratch for better hip hop documentaries. The bahamadia scene & medusa scene were tight doe."
5,A Hip-Hop Must Have,"Most true lovers of hip-hop agree on some 'must have' albums for their collection to be considered complete (i.e. Illmatic, Ready 2 Die, Criminal Minded, The Cronic, Reasonable Doubt etc. etc.) The same holds true for this particular documentary--Freestyle-The Art of Rhyme. This movie does an amazing job explaining and depicting the at times neglected form of rap called freestyling--which many argue is the true measure of any true emcee. So if you are a real fan of hip-hop culture--you should definitely own at least one copy of this video. Remember--ain't nothin' like hip-hop music. Peace.~A-jacks"
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,The voices are ridiculous and the narrator pretending to speak like a Japanese is just stupid. Very disappointed.
4,Generally good -- mixed review,"The seller was great - this bottle is just the right size for taking with you if you want to freshen your fragrance during a long day/evening/weekend.The fragrance itself, however, leaves a little to be desired. Their descriptions are written by marketing geniuses, and hold much allure...but the products themselves are not quite as enchanting as their merchandising.Highly recommend that you go to a Sephora and check out the fragrances live, before you buy"
4,Decent Book,"A book about the slot machines that the author thought were pretty. This is not a complete history of slot machines, nor is it a book of photgraphs. It is illustrated with drawings of the various slot machines. The drawings are well done and the author has provided information about game play of the illustrated machine. The information is tolerably complete."
4,Very Good,"I found this book to be very good. Unlike some survival books, it covered all nessisary topic such as trapping, signaling, and especialy first-aid/wilderness medicine. Janowsky does a real good job of explaining all the subjects in just 200 pages.The book is writen around his survival and medical kits, which contents he list for you. The book is geared toward northern climates. I thought he could have gone into a little more detail on a few thing, but all in all a very good book. If you are going into the wilds of Alaska or Canada you sould read this book and Bushcraft by Mors Kolchansky."
5,Everything you need to know to survive in these 200 pages!,"Chris has written a very good book here covering all the essentials. If you could only take one book, make this one it. His basic philosophy is simple: THE LESS YOU KNOW THE MORE EQUIPMENT YOU'LL NEED, AND CONVERSLY THE MORE YOU KNOW THE LESS EQUIPMENT YOU CAN GET BY WITH. For example, his simple paragraph (in chapter 4) on fire making materials is miraculous! He reviews Flint/Steel, Matches, Waterproof Matches, Waterproof/WindProof Matches, Electric Spark, Flares, Magnifying Glass, and Friction. I would never have guessed what he chooses and why! This ONE PARAGRAPH ALONE has CHANGED THE ENTIRE WAY I THINK about building a fire and the essential materials needed. His book gets a ""10"" from me for CHANGING THE WAY YOU THINK, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WITH AN ABSOLUTE BARE MINIMUM OF EQUIPMENT COUPLED WITH THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE"
1,Lousy singing and poor list of music.,"My 3 year old pretty much refuses to listen to this stuff, which is a misreable review for a kids CD. I wish I had my 99c back."
3,Great Price BUT....,A wonderful collection of childrens songs but many of the songs are different versions from what you may expect and the sound quality is a bit off
2,Disappointing,"I am not a critic, so I will just be honest here...I have loved every other JOC album they have released, but this one, just isntmy style musically. It has a much more acoustical, folksy, countryish sound to it, and it was really hard for me to get into. I have always especially enjoyed JOC's more upbeat alternative rock sounding songs and found none of those on this album. All the songs are more contemplative, slower songs...nothing that really makes you want to tap your feet or sing at the top of your lungs. The lyrics are great as always. but the musical style on this one, just isn't quite up to par...If you are thinking about buying this one, and you like them becuase of their alternarock, upbeat sound, this one is probably not going to be one of your favorites."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Jars of Clay, but this album didn't do a lot for me. I thought ""Love in Any Language"" and ""Amazing Grace"" were both good songs, but they didn't grab me like the songs from their 11th Hour album. The cover of ""Lonely People"" is maybe better than the original - screaming to be done in this new acoustic, almost bluegrass-y feel. But (and there always seems to be one), the rest of the album was really uninspiring to me. The Jars of Clay debut album was the perfect fusion of their great acoustic sound with challenging lyrics, but this album just doesn't compare. Although The 11th Hour had a very modern rock feel to it, but by taking back the artistic oversight of the production, Jars was really able to put their own soul back into the music. 11th Hour took me back to excitement I had for the band when the debuted. This album didn't take me back to anything but my older cd's."
4,"C'mon, it's not THAT bad ...","I don't know, this CD is not that bad. If you bought this album looking for Kiss music, you will be disappointed. But why expect a guy who has been in a band 30 years to put out solo material sounding just like music in his day job? This music is definately experimental. And looking at the liner notes, you will also realize that this album is partially recorded for fun (and of course (...)). Look again.. Shannon Tweed and his CHILDREN do some of the background vocals. Don't take life so seriously."
1,Dear God ANOTHER Washed Up Loser Trying To Make MORE Money!!,"Gene for god sakes give it up, Kiss sucked when they were out and now this. For god sake what the hell are you doing this album is beyond terrible, beyond words. This by far has to be the absolute worst album ever made. Whatever money hungrey loser ok'd this (...) to be released and put out in stores outta be drug out in the middle of nowhere and not only verbially abused but physcially as well. I simply cant get over how just straight up BAD this is. Kiss never had a lick of talent anyway and now he has the gaul to go and do a solo record. Gene you and thet (...) wife of your have enough money. i guess watching your wife (...) random people in the movies is ok and fun for you 2 losers to watch. Gene give up the singing career...again you have no talent, Kiss had no talent and this cd is beyond NO TALENT.....Gene help us all help you STOP MAKING MUSIC....because you BOTH SUCK"
1,Shame on you Mr. Simmons!,"I have been a die hard Kiss fan since 1977 and Gene Simmons has always been my favorite band member. Through the years I have followed his carreer closely and some of the projects that Mr. Simmons has done over the years are not likely to have made him even richer than he already is. Last Xmas I got the KISS-Symphony DVD from my girlfriend and that I have to say was one magnificent musical masterpiece. In my mind, a full throttle KISS in make up Live on stage is the ultimate rock and roll experience anyone can ask for. When I got Gene's new solo album I was excited and open minded but after listening to it I have to say that this must be the lowest that the 'God of thunder' has went in his whole musical carreer. As a true KISS and Gene fan, I feel it is my duty to say what first comes to my mind after listening to this album, shame on you Mr. Simmons!Regards,Hjalti S. HjaltasonAkureyri, Iceland."
3,He gave it his all.,"Gene Simmons is an outstanding showman. He truly is a great rock and roll bass man. Gene has a major entourage surrounding him and he is provided valuable information regarding the recording industry. Let it be understood - he knew exactly what he was doing when putting this CD together. He was aiming at a very narrow market niche. Way to go Gene, I still admire your style and commitment to provide your fans what they want.Signed IALMOSTMADEIT (but then I left the band)PS - I rated it 3 stars for my personal taste."
1,Dreadful,"To think, William Hung sold more records with his debut than Gene did with this drivel. An absolute waste of time and money (both Gene's and mine). I hope (and am sure) Paul's solo cd will dance circles around this."
4,Love the Show,"Larry David manages to do it again. Every time I watch this show I laugh uncontrollably. If you like the past seasons, you will definitely like this season as well."
2,Disappointed,"I usually roll on the floor laughing with this show, but this season offered only a few really good laughs. His show wife,Cheryl,often reacts to Larry the way we would, but this season, she seemed bored most of the time. I don't think I'll buy the following season."
3,Should have been better,While not a complete catastrophe this season does not at all live up to previous seaseons. Indeed Larry David's own acting is no longer on par: he no longer is as natural as before. The storylines also somehow lack he charm of previous seasons. It also does tend to be somewhat over the top especially the last episode The End. Do not get me wrong I loved the previous seasons and there have allways been some really wonderful ideas in the past episodes but this was just not as good. As I said especially Larry is no longer as fun. Jeff and his wife also are somewhat more boring than usual So let's see.
4,lotsa laughs,"I don't have HBO, so I got to see all these episodes for the first time when I bought the DVD. I have to say that I thought this season was very funny. Aside from the last episode, especially the last part of it, I enjoyed everything in this season."
3,Meh.,"I feel as though this show peaked in season 3/4 and is now on it's way out. I still love LD and the gang, but season 5 left me wanting. It's worth seeing, but realize that it probably will let you down."
3,The book on about how to be in computer Maintnance,"This is a good book about how to have the great futer in computer Maintenance and And work and job apportunities in the great fuature in computer, Copmpuets are the future of life."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"I do not recommend these CD's at all, at all! They are all well good for those of you out there who like the sappy Celtic modern music, but for you who like the traditional Celtic, this CD is NOT for you. I have read the books by Steven Lawhead (that these CD's are supposed to be based on) The Song Of Albion, three times though and I did not get the idea of music like this. The Song Of Albion invokes in the reader a feel for true Celticness and mysticism and with these Cd's you find yourself flung not into the Steven Lawhead Otherworld, but more into that of Xena, Warrior Princess. Not good. If you love Llew and Teged and Cynan and Bran and all of them, and love the world they are in, it will not help you to see the vision more clearly by setting it to music of our own age."
4,Stand-up flooring tool.,"My poor knees and back appreciate this tool. It zips along shooting screws with few problems. Still trying to figure how to load screw ""belt"" so that the very first screw is used, not #3. Because of its size it takes a while to adjust to setting up and handling. However, the ability to stand and work makes up for the minor probs."
5,Worth its Weight in Gold!,"I had to screw in 3000sf of subfloor in a new home. I knew I didn't want to be on my hands and knees with a standard impact driver, but I also knew that I was getting gouged when the framers wanted $650 to do it. I picked up this bad boy along with $60 worth of screws and went to work. I shot 3000 screws before lunch and it never missed a beat. Made quick work of a potenitally horrible job. It paid for itself in one use and I look forward to using it on a new deck next month."
1,Casino Keno,"This book was very basic, had nothing in it that you couldn't find on a pamphlet handed out for free at any casino. There was only one page that had some keno tips on it that may be helpful to some people, especially people new to the game of keno. But for anyone else that has played this game before, there is nothing new in this book that we keno players don't already know."
4,Great!,"I really liked this book. The end is....well, ill let you find out. I read it and no it does not involve sexual content. How ever, it does involve 5 girls with magical powers who are trying to stop an evil prince from destroying the world, and killing the rightful eir to the throne, his sister. (Make sure 2 read books 1-10 1st! Those were good 2)"
2,This is NOT an audio CD,"Buyer beware. This is NOT an audio CD, but an instructional book with an accompanying CD. I, unfortunately, found this out the hard way, but I figured I'd let future buyers know before making the mistake I did."
1,You have voice mail - not.,"Opps, you won't know if you have any messages unless you develop a Pavlovian response to look at the phone everytime you see it. No audible alert. Buyer beware."
5,"A very,very good phone!!!!!!!","Simple enough this phone is all about durability and range,range and more range!!!!!!! I took this phone outside my house walked approx. 200-300ft. from the base with perfect clarity! The only reason I didn't use the phone for a longer distance is because it needed to charge =) (I just got it). This phone is superior to other 2-Line 900Mhz phones by far! This phone is armored and has rubber side grips which really make it good for working outside with it (has a belt-clip also).This phone is hands down the best two-line non-expandable DSS phone you can buy. GJ Panasonic, you have the edge over all manufacturer's is this catagory of phone.A big thumbs up!"
2,BEWARE...PHONE INTERFERES WITH WIRELESS NETWORK,"I purchased two of these at the same time and they work perfectly EXCEPT they know out my wireless (WiFi)computer network every time they are used. This is extremely annoying and has resulted in my need to retire these expensive phones. I tried switching the frequency, but that did not work..the wireless was still knocked out when the phone was used. So, wireless network users beware!"
1,Junk,Took a LONG time for my machine to recognize the reader. Ran very slow when it did work. I am very computer literate. I tried all ports and other computers. Cost more in time & money to return it than it's worth. Recommend the Sandisk instead.
1,had to get a refund,"I do not or will not ever believe that date rape/rape is sexy or that a person can redeem himself for such an act.. I don't care if he was drunk drugged or anything.. Wait and No mean exactly that.... I did not finish this book, I couldn't even if I tried the story hit home for me.. I had to ask for a refund I avoid stories like this as if the Devil were riding in the wind and trying to snatch me..."
5,Return request of Lost Villages,"With the recent interest in genealogy research, I feel this book is an excellent source for all researchers looking for cemeteries within the Delaware County boundries.I just recently found this book and recommend it to everyone doing genealogy work. The draw back is that it is out of print.I feel that a reprint would definitely be in order. I understand the first time around was a huge success and see it doing the same again. Who ever would make this decision would be well advised to give it very serious consideration.A superb book on the location of many old and forgotten cemeteries as well as a great source of lost historical information on old villages and their peoples and lives."
5,Going SOLO,"Great case. I've built a couple of boxes and this is by far the nicest case I've used. No sharp edges, plenty of room, nice looks, and great features inside that allow swapping components in short order. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a removable MOBO tray, but that's a minor issue. Overall a very nice case."
2,Missing screws and standoffs!,The case came without screws or motherboard standoffs even though the description specifically said it does (I've checked everywhere). Tried to contact Antec to no avail. Didn't bother to return since I had a deadline to meet. Will not use Antec cases again.
4,JAKES MOVIE,I like this movie it had a lot of suspense in it. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It will keep you guessing
3,Philosophy of the 16th and 17th centuries,"This is a short anthology of philosophical writings from Europe of the 16th and 17th centuries. The selections are traditional, but this is to be expected from the limited space available that precludes a selection of anyone but the major philosophers of the period, though there is a strange absence of any of the philosophes of the early Enlightenment.A page or two detailing its historical context and giving relevant biographical information briefly introduce each selection. However, these are quite brief and often do not give the philosophers an adequate philosophical context, and it will be difficult to use this anthology on its own. It will be useful as a reference of original source materials to accompany a book or course on the history of philosophy."
1,Faulty electronics,"The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag. We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages. The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this. Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out. For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker. We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid). Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems. I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location. I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality."
1,kitchenaid is bad,"As with other reviews here, my coffeemaker spews coffee all over the counter, this is my second kitchenaid coffeemaker- the first was recalled and they sent me this piece of garbage- I have a 220.00 kitchenaid blender that is worse than this coffeemaker- STAY AWAY!!"
2,"Good maker, false warranty","I purchased this same coffeemaker in SS for myself a year and a half ago. 3 mos. after I started using it, it began to leak, called Kit.Aid and they replaced it with a brand new one. That one has worked perfecly since, it gets 5 Stars... I bought this one for my mom in the red and the day she started using it leaked. We called Kitchen Aid because we knew of the warranty (one year replacement, etc). They told us they had no more red in their replacement program (but they are still selling it on their website)...They could give her a 10 cup replacement or she could purchase a professional series for $[...] more (a 12 cupper)... In my opinion, they should replace it with the SAME maker. She of course could get a SS or white, but no the same one we purchased. Love MY maker, upset about the replacement warranty..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I had a KitchenAid Coffee maker years ago that I absolutely LOVED. I had to replace it when the carafe broke and I couldn't get a replacement anywhere. When this new coffee maker came out from KitchenAid, I was beyond excited. I thought my mornings would once again be filled with coffee heaven. Boy, was I wrong! The 1st unit I got leaked coffee and grinds everywhere. I called KitchenAid and they sent me a new one. Worked great for a few days, but now leaking again. The problem is due to the pause system. The carafe has to be placed on the warming unit in a very precise way. If it's too far in or out it leaks. What a mess and hassle. I can't deal with that BEFORE I've had my 1st cup of joe. Although KitchenAid is a great company to deal with, I will not be giving them any more chances on this one."
2,Find a dfferent movie,Es geht (It was OK)aber es is nicht so gut (but not very good). There are plenty of other movies to watch that are much better such as Die Flucht and Comedian Harmonist.
4,Good Quality,This mirror is very well made with a sturdy base. The magnification is great. I can see alot with this magnification. Excellent for plucking facial hairs.
4,Cat Shampoo,I have a pixibob cat and she is very difficult to hang onto and this shampoo works really well for her. It also has less chemicals to harm her. Thanks
4,Thought-provoking,This is a very thought-provoking book. We talk about its concepts all the time. My husband was reading it on an out-of-town trip and left it in his hotel room. He called me from out of town to ask if I could find another copy.
3,I Like Henze's Later Work!,"I love modern opera. I prefer it to the Puccinis and Verdis. I sometimes travel just to hear Berg, Janacek, Prokofiev, Sallinen, Saariaho, Ades, Adams .... and most avidly the Henzes, wherever they're staged. But this production of Henze's early effort at resuscitating the story of Manon Lescaut bores me to tears. It's as musically vapid as Puccini's Manon Lescaut, or so it sounds on this DVD. Would a different conductor wring more from the score? The singing is not at fault, though the recording quality is rather thin. And the staging is dire without being intellectually disturbing, like a reproduction of a German Expressionist painting in black-and-white. I usually like to take my Depravity with a fillip of Insight.But... I WILL watch&hear; this DVD again in a few weeks, and if my second impression is different, I'll revise this review."
3,too small,"I bought this product years ago and loved them. The new ones are too small, they are not as large as the previous ones. Adidas makes a similar sock now with some small white stripes, but otherwise it is black like this one. I much prefer the adidas sock to the wigwam sock. i gave away my unused wigwam socks."
5,Love Through the Ages,"I have always been interested in literature that touches on my ancestors' beginnings in the USA. Ms. Berry has written a very moving story of a love that transcends the boundaries of time and remembrance. Her memorable characters, Ms. Cozy, Fina and Ross, will take you on a journey back through time, to slavery days and teach you that the power of love is stronger than chains, distance or the passage of years. Together they discover a connection that was foretold generations before any of them were ever born. This is a must read for all lovers of black history and eternal love. Bravo, Bertice!"
1,thoughts of you,"This books was sort of hard for me to get into. I'm not gonna down play it any, because it just wasn't the book for me at the time. Maybe I'll pick it up again later."
2,ok,"I became interested in Bertice Berry after hearing her speak at my university, she was very fun and witty. I expected more of out this book. It tries to convey a message of hope, truth, etc but does so in a very corny matter. The book is predictable and i expected more from Berry."
2,Buy the Amit Kalani (Que) book instead,"I purchased the first edition of this book--which is twice as big as the one currently in the bookstore (2nd edition). I was very disappointed with the first. As I browsed the 2nd edition in the bookstore, my faith in the MSPress series was not restored.Bottom line: buy the Amit Kalani book from Que instead. That is tremendously better. I think it is the best book for studying the material on the test. Also, don't forget to get the Trancender exams and flash cards. They too are also very helpful."
1,Keeping it Real,"Definitely this book contains some useful material. The first chapters make a good impression, but as you go further you start to see that something is wrong. The author was facing an aggressive deadline and did not take into consideration anything.The book will be thrilling to read for someone who already knows and have a hands on experience with .NET, because the book will make you think by making you try to resolve the unclear material. The author definitely knows his stuff and demonstrates that fact to you, but don't hope for any explanations they are beyond the scope of this book.Also you will enjoy the wonderful late night ""I WON"" feeling, after succeeding actually to RUN the most of C# examples.I kinda regret reading this book, because I have to read now an other one to pass the test."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,Don't waste your time and money buying this book and preparing the exam using this book. Use Amit Kalani's book instead.
4,"I read the book and passed the exam, but...",That's a very interesting book but that's true that it isn't enough. It must be completed with a good book about .NET framework fundamentals. ...at least if you're planning to go for the exam!
3,Just took the beta exam.,"I used this book almost exclusively to prepare for the beta exam (along with MSDN). Overall I'd say the book does a pretty good job of preparing you. If you really want to be sure I'd get ADO.NET, ASP.NET, and XML book(s) to complement it.I didn't have time to run through all the labs, but the ones I did do worked just fine.The test-prep software does have good questions, but (as other posters have mentioned) it doesn't give any feedback about if you got the question right or wrong. If you are not used to MCP exams, I'd purchase some 'third party' test-prep software also.It is a gigantic leap forward for a MS-Press book. I've never been a fan on MS-Press's 'Test Prep' books, but this one can legitimately compete 'third party' books."
1,Hurried and beginner level.,"Simply put: There is not enough information in this book to come close to passing the actual exam (If the beta exam is any measure).Seems MS rushed this one out the door, most of the information contained in the book is straight from the online help, and the quickstart tutorial... save your dough!"
4,HOPE POLARIZED PEOPLE SEE WHAT THE 9-11 REPORT RECOMMENDS:,"Since this election is so polarized, it would be nice if both sides would be more respectful of our ideals as recommended by the 9-11 Commission report on p. 377: ""The United States must do more to communicate its message. Recommendation: Just as we did in the Cold War, we need to defend our ideals abroad vigorously. America does stand up for its values. The U.S. defended, and still defends, Muslims against tyrants and criminals in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. If the U.S. does not act aggressively to define itself in the Islamic world, the extremists wil gladly do the job for us."" I just hope some of our so called extremist ""intellectuals"" keep this in mind."
1,Too critical,"I have two criticisms of this book:1. It is far too critical of our glorious leader, C-in-C, President Bush2. It's extremely liberalDon't let the title fool you, it's yet another liberally biased liberal spun example of the total domination of liberals in all areas of media, politics, government, etcBut hey it's still a free country (until Nov 2nd, that is), so go ahead and read for yourselves."

3,Bloodworms for Bettas,"I bought these with my betta fish Boe. He ate them for about a week before he started refusing to eat them. Scared to death that my sweet little guy would leave the face of earth, I bought pellets and now he eats three daily and always swims to the top of the tank when I come.Anyway, a few months went by when I decided to drop 2 bloodworms in his tank to see what would happen. It seems, after a break, Boe likes them again! Now I switch off between pellets, bloodworms, and flakes for a balanced diet.San Francisco Bay Brands is the only company I've found that sells bloodworms! San Francisco Bay Brands:thanks a lot!**SUGGESTION**If you have a small betta fish, like Boe, I recommend cutting the bloodworms in half. Boe will barf up his bloodworms if I don't cut them in half because they're too big."
4,Worth every dollar and more!!,This was the most inspirational video I have ever seen. It is a must to purchase!
5,Master of Darkness,"More terrifying tales of life's undercarriage from the Master of Darkness and Despair, Stuart Millard. Frantic through desperation, to be included, to be wanted, to be loved, Millard's central characters are ruthlessly eviscerated, revealing their innermost fears and uppermost fantasies. Few writers today delve so deep.My favourite piece in this book, and possibly by Millard to date (although his blog is also worth checking out for new writing) is the 4-parter ""The Ostrich and the Insects"". Although typically dark and perverse in its dealing of an everyday supernatural occurrence, it is also a beautifully crafted piece of writing that leaves you knowing that you are reading something of quality.Again undersold by the packaging, as wasFrantic Planet/Frantic Planet: Volume I, Frantic Planet 2 is also full of imaginative plots, devilish twists and turns, and unforeseen surprises. Highly recommended."
3,Superficial heroine,I have to admit that I did not complete Believe. I gave up after the first half of the book. The heroine is superficial and the dialogue that she has with Merlin and Galahad is unrealistic and lacks any real depth. The concept of the story (about a woman who is transported back into the mythical land of Camelot) has merit but the author could have created characters with more depth and more realistic characterizations.
5,MAKES YOU BELIEVE,"This was one funny and romantic time travel book.The scenes between Tessa and Galahad were hilarious. The idea of an American woman thrown into the Middle Ages was amazing and creative.The story was beautiful and well written dialogue,a true adventure along with the chivalry ,honor, faith and pure love."
5,"Comeback of Valerie, the funny outrageous queen-of-the mess.","The show has merit and a lot of hidden ill-philosophy about thedysfunctional me-me-me-and only me-pop-actors-and-singers.The character of Valerie is fun, funny, and sympathetic.As things progressed, she is more likeable, and more edgy.The gay friend of Valerie is great, as funny and the outrageousqueen-of-the mess."
4,"Great series, but NOT for the easily embarrassed","What a great show this is! Lisa Kudrow is AMAZING and the casting for all the other parts is perfect!That being said, you have to be able to deal with the high humiliation factor on this show. I loved the original (british) Office series...The Comeback is almost twice as humiliating/embarrassing imo, and several times I've had to hide my face from the TV due to the utter embarrassment that Lisa's character supplies/aids/witnesses. It's almost too much to bear, so be prepared!"
3,Excellent until Billy gets out of jail...,"I thought the first 1/3 to 1/2 of this book was fantastic. Unfortunately, I felt that the book really lost a lot of steam once Billy got out of jail. Once the story turned to the usual evil old lawyers vs. new young lawyer plot, I lost a lot of interest. Plus, with Billy juggling work, investigating Daryl's case, chasing 2 women, investigating his father's case, and visiting home and the jail, there just seemed to be too many things going on at once."
2,Nice background music - not more,"The word is *monotonous*. There is no real melody or significant sound variation. The entire set of tracks is uneventful (although somewhat better than other Deuter's releases), and individual tracks are hardly different from each other.Concepts of ""relaxation"" and ""meditation"" shouldn't be excuses for writing uninspired and bland soundtracks. Frankly, these pieces didn't require excessive amounts of creativity.If you are only looking for some background sound to play in your yoga studio, this is the ticket. However, if you want actual music that's also soothing and relaxing, take a look at Amethystium, Enya or Himekami."
3,Update of my previous review,"I think Bob's book is getting unfairly trashed by all the self-proclaimed ""UFO buffs"". Do any UFO experts have proof that the alleged aliens aren't satanic demons? NO. So how can they say that Bob is wrong? How does anyone really know......And this is why I'm a nihilist"
1,Bigotry is taken universally!,"I wish I would have read the reviews here first before I purchased this book. The author doesn't believe that (his) god would have created any other life other than here; how self-centered. But if there is, surely it is satanic. It is sad that with all the unrest we have here on this planet the author wants to go to war with someone who may or may not exist. This book upset me, but then I realized that it is only trash. With this bigoted attitude...and he wondered why Cabot and Strieber were upset! If you are the Christian you claim to be, Mr. Larson, then I ask you...What Would Jesus Do?"
5,Great book on helo pioneers,"This is a masterpiece on the four US helicopter pioneers -- Sikorsky, Bell (Arthur Young), Piasecki, and Stanley Hiller. Only faults to the book are (1) that it primarily focuses on the pioneers (hence the title), not the machines, and (2) he has nothing at all good to say about Hughes helicopters. In fact, it's pretty well damning. I think it should've been a little more objective. Also doesn't cover Charlie Kaman, who was also one of the early pioneers and still active today."
2,some spot was off,"Some spot was off on The white paint on the Guess Women's White Chronograph was off when I got it , I didn't like that at all ."
5,Great for dancing and working out,this great cd has awesome music to dance to and specially to work out to.the songs are tunes you've heard on the radio and at the club and probably always wanted just did not know it.awesomely great compilation!!!
3,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MOTIVATION....,"After reading a plethora of motivational books over the years. This one is good because of the adversities Kyle went through, however, it is not a book I would read twice. I assume that is because Kyle is only 19 when this book was written. I can tell he is self sufficient as it doesn't appear he had any help from ghostwriters to put this book together. The book is motivational however I question whether this book will be the most compelling for someone who looks to apply whats in his book. In short this book is good to read but, I doubt it will be your most memorable read.There are more compelling stories out there and not to mention better written for those who look to be doers."
3,Quick and Optimistic,"I am a high school English teacher and purchased this book as a possible non-fiction text for use in class. It is a quick, easy, and optimistic read. You can tell it is written from the perspective of a young man, but it is a young man with unique experiences."
3,Kyle is truely an inspiration but the book falls short -- sorry!,"I hate to be a downer because Kyle's story is unbelievable. Thanks to a VERY STRONG support system (parents and coaches), Kyle has made the most from incredible odds. Here is why I gave No Excuses 3 stars. The book focuses 75% on his wrestling. As a reader, I wanted to read more about his everyday life such as eating or tying his shoes, interaction with teachers and friends and etc. It would have been nice for him to address what his daily struggles are and how he gets around them. I applaude Kyle and hope the future is very bright for him. The end of the book give Frequently Asked Question and he gives answers to them. I wish Kyle would have expanded on some of the questions and answers. There is only so much wrestling I can read about."
3,Nothing new,"This film has nothing new that is not better done in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn.I enjoyed this film as a kid, but was disappointed as an adult. Several long speeches at the beginning. Any writer can tell a story with speeches; a good writer tells the story with action and dialogue.Robin Hood grabs and kisses Maid-Marion within 30-seconds of meeting her for the first time; as though looks alone are the only qualifier. Bad, shallow, script."
2,Item not in very good shape,The shipping was very fast and the transaction went smoothly but the item was in poor shape and I did not want the international edition.
4,Good pics,"For the price, this was a good deal. I wanted pictures of Gorillas to use as references for painting, and this book served the purpose."
2,Skip in Track 9,"I downloaded this album and discovered a skip in Track 9 ""Ride On B.T."" I emailed customer service and got a full refund of the purchase price, but it was unclear if the track would be fixed. They simply said to check back in a few days to see if there was a corrected version, but there's no way to know unless I purchase the track again. So be careful with this album. As far as the music goes, however, this is a great B.T. Express record that is very hard to find with good sound quality, and the rest of the songs appear to be perfect."
2,"Content is good, but speaker and sound effects are not.","The Sun Tzu book is a difficult read, so I thought by having an audio companion, it would help me with a more thorough comprehension.As the content of the book is genius in regards to war tactics, philosophy, etc., I thought the reading and presentation were lackluster at best. The reader's monotone voice with no interpretative expression, like a dramatic pause or inflection of certain words, made the audio book boring and often times irritating to listen to. It sounded as if he was reading the book for the first time. I thought the sounds effects were horrible and the production very cheap, just like the ink stamp on the CD and the Xerox copied cover of the CD case.Save your money on this rendition of Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" audiobook and search for other options."
3,its kinda flopy,"Well this product works. Lets just say that. I bought this for my 04 colorado and im glad i did. I went to many retail stores in my town any they wanted 90 100 and even 125 for a harness. NAY NAY I SAY!!! Well being the hebrew that i am i decided to check amazon. 60 was the lowest i could find. Well when i took the product out the first problem had occured. The speaker box being the size of donald trumps wallet had magically broke open. Now by the design of this it looks to be a common thing. Common at that i would say, you cannot even look at this without flopping open and spilling its jewels. So i slapped some tape on this and called it a day. This has enough wire to make your instilation interestng at best. But it works. Also the chime is at best the sound of a dying duck. Loud and un natural."
5,Perfect!,I bought this harness to install an aftermarket radio in my 2008 Grand Prix... it works great with no issues at all and the installation was seamless... I called around to different shops for installation and received quotes from anywhere between $150 - $400... I bought this harness and saved myself hundreds of dollars...
3,"MONSOON OWNERS, READ THIS FIRST","This will not work for monsoon systems. I didn't do my research, but am pretty sure that it didn't say that on the product page, only mentioned that it wouldn't work with onstar. It will not work with any monsoon or bose system. There is another adapter for that: GMOS-04"
3,a must have for a quality install,well made compared to the scosche one I previously had that quit working. but at the time of purchase was kind of expensive the prices have gone down considerably.
4,Fascinating record of an alternate history,"Published in 1977, this compiles the dialog that was carried out in the pages of the Coevolution Quarterly, and documents Brand's unique style of facilitating constructive conversations. I looked over this to see an instance of his capacious enthusiasm at work, and it is curious that in this case, the path ran dry. I think John Holt, the advocate of unschooling, does an excellent job of posing some of the serious engineering challenges that were handwaved away. One great quote, from Wendell Berry, which Brand echoes back to him in a series of letters they published: ""Humans are destructive in proportion to their supposition of abundance; if they are faced with an infinite abundance, they will become infinitely destructive."" (p84)"
4,McBain Magic,"Ghosts, dead writers --- and editors, twin sisters, cops on the road; this book has the usual myriad mish-mash of action found in McBain's adddictive 87th Precinct novels, but this around this is more local color and descriptions of towns outside of the ""big city"" of Isola, where the 87th Precinct is located. Carella and crew once again delight us with their adventures and sharp, funny dialogue. Once again, plots within plots expand and twist: Did Steve ""lust in his heart"" over another woman during an investigation, and in relating this event did it make his wife Teddy angry? You'll have to read the book and find out. Another page turner."
5,great speed.,the best on the market.make dvd and cd with no hassle.good product for good price.would recommend it any time.
2,Did Author Lose Interest?,"I would NOT recommend this book. I purchased it 2 years ago and have read much of the code and downloaded several examples. At that time the web site referenced appeared to be only half completed. Now, in September 2006, the url is not even available. While many of the code examples are well explained, in themselves they are not adequate to duplicate the projects. Unfortunately, it appears that the author has lost interest. That's a shame because this severely limits the value of the textbook."
3,still doesn't work properly,"If you have an older version of NU, it has to be totally removed or some of the parts won't work. I've tried several times (and I'm an experienced Mac user).l Frustrating, and tech support takes forever. I don't know how it works if this is your first version."
1,If this book were taken as truth today:,"The inquisition would still be alive and well today if material like this were taken as anything resembling factual or even relevent to reality. Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche would have a field day with this diatribical works that are aking to a Jack Chick denunciation of the intellectual freedoms of others as free-thinking beings.Mein Kampf would be another shelf-fellow of this work, but so would the personal journal of Tomás de Torquemada."
5,My Cow Thanked Me,"Before Bag Balm, I had a dry irritated cow. She would complain about the chaffing due to my insipid tuggins upon an area that God designed for feeding her calves. So Christian am I, that I agreed: Chaffed Udders are the work of the Devil. We tried plenty of Snake-oil remedies...of course to no avail.But then my father in law suggested Bag Balm ""It works on both my cow's & my udders"". Good Gracious was he correct. I now have the happiest cow on God's Great Green Earth. My cow actually wrote (slightly misspelled). TANK EWE, in the mud of the meadow.Thank you Bag Balm"
4,Surprisingly effective.,"Bag Balm (aka cow salve) was originally developed for soothing sore, chapped udders (yes, on cows). However, it has successfully been used on human for years. It's great for minor scrapes and abrasions (I use it for cat scratches), acting as a soothing, antiseptic ointment. It's also superb for extremely chapped skin such as dry, cracked heels or fingers.The pluses:- It's cheap, and a tin of it will last for years.- It works beautifully.- It can be used on pets, livestock and humans!The minuses:- It contains lanolin, so avoid it if you're allergic to wool.- It's greasy, and has a pungent medicinal smell (you're not going to want to wear it out as a moisturiser)."
4,Bag Balm - not just for cows,My dermatologist recommended Bag Balm for dry chapped lips and it works great! It is also more affordable than lip balms manufactured for people. I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from severe dry or chapped lips.
5,GOOD OLD STANDBY ITEM,I PURCHASED BAG BALM FROM PHARMAFRAG THROUGH AMAZON AND RECEIVED VERY FAST SERVICE..BAG BALM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MANY YEARS AND IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT...I USED IT WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS A BABY...WORKED WONDERS FOR DIAPER RASH... MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED IT FOR A SKIN PROBLEM AND IT IS WORKING WONDERS FOR IT...WILL KEEP IT ON HAND IN THE FUTURE...THANKS
3,Works alright.,"I suppose it works alright. The smell is bit much though, so I would recommend using it only at night."
3,More expensive to buy the 4.5lb pail?,"What is up with that? It's $.58/oz for the 4.5 pound pail and $.47/oz to buy 10oz. Reverse Costco pricing? No thanks, I'll stick with 10oz."
4,Mirror,"Good price, fast shipping. Item is a little loose, should have come with the glue to properly mount mirror but still good."
4,A little over priced,This book was a little over priced my husband thought he was buying a hardback book and paid $30 for a paperback book! Otherwise the book was in great shape and shipped to us in a good amount of time!
5,Best book I ever read,"This is my favorite book of all time. I haven't seen it in years and have been looking for it for a long time. It is the first mainstream book I read that said, ""Good needs Evil, just as Evil needs Good to exist."""
1,Is MPD real?,"Weell, Dr. Putnam ""confirmed"" a diagnosis of MPD on me in the '80's through his ""brain-wave tests"". Many painful years later, I realized the ""MPD"" had been created by the desire to please a ""therapist"" who wanted a multiple to rival Truddi Chase.Putnam's book is a handbook on how to be a multiple--read it and become--it is readable and logical to someone who is looking for MPD. Reading it again after many years, I found it's logic inconsistent and scientifically doubtful."
3,Works OK with soft cheese,"It will slice your cheese and even comes with a replacement wire. However, overall the unit is cheap. For instance, the backside of the handle is hollow (i assume to save on material costs) and the adjustable bit is a bit flimsy. I'd recommend spending a bit more to get a better quality product. However, it does slice cheese and has not broke yet. Just feels and looks cheap."
1,Overpriced piece of tough plastic,"This lid is awful. It's super tough and thick. Doesn't stretch well. Will NOT fit my cat food can! My cat eats EVO 5.5 oz canned cat food with standard 3-3/8"" diameter. Upon measuring, this lid has fittings for 3"" OR 3-1/4"" cans. Hope this helps!"
1,"Get original replacement,the generic ones are junk.","These are not true Kenmore filters. The real Kenmore filters are way better. I like saving a buck as much as the next guy,and i always shop for the lowest price whenever i can,but this filter is junk. On rare occasions,it pays to get the original parts,THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES. You even have to be careful when you buy these from Sears. Buy them straight from SEARS.COM , and not from the PARTS department. The generic filters don't soak up water very well, the real Kenmore filters will draw water throughout the entire filter,making them 80% more effective.[...]"
5,Great Price - Fast Shipping,"I have read reviews regarding these ""wicking"" filters as compared to the original paper filters. They ARE different, but they fit perfectly and seem to be working fine. No complaints. Great seller, had the best prices and I received it on the 3rd business day. Can't complain about that at all."
4,Dated but predicted the future,"Of great decline in republican party as evidenced by recent elections, particularly the POTUS. If repubs don't adapt, book predicts they will vanish, much like Whigs became Republicans."
3,Just Okay,"Typical RL Stine.Someone terrifing Ellie.Sending black flowers and a scary note.Plus on her birthday a human hamd.Yet who would want to do this?Is it Chip,the husband of Abby who hired Ellie as a live in nanny to watch her 2 kids Heather and Brandon.Also what's up with Brandon who's 4 years old and does'nt speak.Also there's a guest house that everyone tells Ellie to stay away for ...Why...Guess you'll have to read the book to find out."
4,Mediocre,"I used to read Stine's Goosebumps, Fear Street and Point Horror books, and I still find some of his goosebumps books more entertaining than this. In this book, he's clearly finding it hard to shake off his 'teen' style, and sex, drugs, alcohol and excessive swearing don't make this a proper adult thriller. It was too short, almost lazy, but still ok. I'm sure he's capable of writing a proper adult novel given time, and this was too kiddy, too inconsistent. But hey, I'm only 16, what do I know?"
2,not a keeper,I like this author and i was unhappy to read a book of hers that is filled with such unhappiness.I should have realized that i wouldn't like it in the first couple of pages when they talked of their marriage and why she was leaving him. I didn't like the hero and he didn't seem all that sorry for what he had done during their marriage. I am just not a fan of 'realistic' romances. I pretty much skimmed through this book and even then i didn't finish it. I got to the point when i threw it against the wall and was done with it.
5,Great for Bible Study,"I enjoy the Navarre Bible it is great for the bible study I am doing, The Great Adventure Timeline. I use this bible as a supplement to my RSV-CE bible because of the narratives. It gives a greater understanding and background information for the area you are studing."
3,Read it for the wrong reasons.,"I wrote a 2-star review on this book a couple of years ago that was thoroughly lambasted by more 'enlightened' readers, so apparently it was felt that I didn't get it.I was reading a humorous book on American history and I saw this referenced several times, so I bought it thinking it was a serious overview of English history told with a humorous slant. It's not, and if you didn't know anything about English history before reading this you won't know much more after. I also found a lot of the humor to be annoyingly corny, like calling the Mayflower the 'Mayfly' (???).So I'll give it three stars instead of two this time, and I'm curious how many pompous comments I'll attract."
3,"Mediocre story, crisp artwork","I have a knack for trying every type of comic book genre out there. I love the movie version of the Mask. It was a unique and hillarious take on superhero genre, if you can classify this into it. However the storyline in this sequel is merely designed for gags and outlandish stunts that the holder of the Mask does. You get to see the mask being worn by various individuals. Just mayhem and stupid acts throughout. The art by Doug Mahnke does suit the story well."
3,SHOULD BE RETITLED,"This video is 50 minutes and 70% of it is devoted to the Toronto Skydome. The information leading up to why there were domed stadiums is good. The Astrodome section is too brief and the Metrodome and Silverdome aren't even mentioned. If the Skydome and history of retractable roofs for sporting event venues is of strong interest, you'll like this film. For me, it wasn't complete."
5,Sheepskin shoulder pad,"I have more uses for this than the sheep did. Not only is it great for seat belts but for camera bags and shoulder holsters for those heavy magnums.Use your imagination and the uses are endless.Very well made,much better than the cheap plastic ones."
1,Not genuine,"I received this today. After reading so many positive reviews I am stunned by the poor quality of this product. I can only deduce that they changed the product somewhere along the line. It is most assuredly NOT sheepskin, but rather some sort of synthetic material. It is very stiff and uncomfortable. Stay away from this one."
2,Not wide enough,These seatbelt shoulder pads are high quality and soft but unfortunately they are not wide enough so don't move up and down on the seat belt easily.
3,Better than nothing...,"I NEED a pad on my seatbelt to prevent it from cutting into my neck. This protector is VERY thin and probably won't last long (seatbelt eventually cuts right through), but should be better than nothing. Unfortunately, these are becoming very difficult to find and you may have to settle for this one."
3,Doesn't hold my daughter's interest.,"My daughter loves her other Little Leaps games, but this one is a dud. Maybe it's just her, but she prefers the interactive puppets versus the cartoons. Not only that, but there are fewer games on this one than the other puppet type games.If you already have the others, then you may want this one to add to your collection.If you don't have others, I'd recommend theLeapFrog Little Leaps' Play & Moveinstead."
4,Very cool,I have it and it is a great item for cube farms or quieter situations. I use it for my portable DVD player so that the speaker can be by me and the screen further away. I also use it at work on my work PC for music and can keep the speaker closer to the keyboard for better sound than normal speakers without bothering others.
2,It's almost worth 0.99,"Smacks of SNL's Al Franken's ""I like me"" skits.However, the listen, understand the problem, present a pleasant way to solve a problem and think positive is basic stuff that is sometimes overlooked.Wouldn't pay 7 dollars for this. The message above pretty much is a good summary. 99 pennies is valid to spend for the whole thing."
3,A little thin on Objectivity,"This is a discussion of why the allies were superior and as such is not so objective. Obviously written by an American however the author gives a nice nod to the Australian & New Zealand allies. It centres on the Guadalcanal and New Guinea campaigns and does not branch into the Central Pacific or Philippines, but is about the South Pacific campaings after all. Outstanding coverage of the weapons involved, more so for the Allied equipment. Easy to read, this book features interviews with veterans, which is valuable and entertaining. This book is an easy read although does drag out a bit too long and not as concise as Touched with Fire The Land War in the South Pacific."
4,Surprisingly Pleasant,"Having only heard five of the songs from ""Songs about Jane"", I was unaware of a few of the songs. On those I had no expectations, but I did know how the three hits went, and they were all very well represented on this live album. The CD opens with ""Harder To Breathe"" and does so very nicely. The vocals start out too weak, as it is a very powerful song and Adam sings it very well in the original. Towards the end he does almost gain the momentum that the original has. It is hard being acoustic to put as much power in it, and I think they succeeded, with all of the songs, in that aspect. I was very pleased with how they performed ""Harder To Breathe"". The Beatles cover is okay, although no where near as good as the original version. The last track sounds very unlike Maroon 5, but sounds good nonetheless. For only being $7-10, depending on where you get it, if you are a Maroon 5 fanboy/girl, or if you just appreciate good variations on good music, get this CD."
2,very technical,"the idea for the book is excellent, a version of secret history from one who was there. I am very interested in WWII era so I looked forward to reading the book. Became bored half way through aa I thought the book would be more designed to be on the exciting side of espionage. Found it too overwhelming with the political problems and underwhelming in the telling of the work done by the agents in enemy territory. Of course, he wasn't behind the lines himself so perhaps my original thought of new stories about the OSS was out of line. From Casey's viewpoint, the book was interesting, but not compelling."
4,Chinese 500 Most Frequently used words,A good companion for the two Yong Ho books on Chinese mandarin. It helps to understand better some grammar and idiomatic aspects of the language. The only complaint I have is the printing types are so small that the reader has to strain his eyes to read it!
2,"Albeit old, but picture quality still disappointing","Great review/comments by Mr. Frei, but I have to say I was disappointed with the picture quality. I realize its a 1969 broadcast and it was harder to save broadcasts in this era so this footage is valuable for its rarity, but I expected better, a lot better. I certainly didn't expect picture quality of modern football/TV but I assumed it was a master from ABC and would be better.The 1969 Michigan-Ohio State game that Rare Sportsfilms restored puts this Arkansas-Texas footage to shame. I'd also swear the version I taped on Classic Sports many years ago was better quality.I just expected better with what I assumed was an ABC master original duplicated in DVD.Consider this a heads up to others who may buy this to be prepared for lessor quality."
2,Dont judge a book by its cover,This book is not for you if you are looking for information on how to build a curved staircase. It virtually tells you nothing except that the stair manufacturer will bring it to you in pieces and install it. The curved staircase picture on the cover may lead you to believe you'll learn about how to construct a curved staircase. That is not the case. Plenty of information on how to construct straight stairs though.
3,A Great Tale Told Blandly,"This was a story that begged to be told. All the elements that should have made it great were there. The auther clearly knew his stuff. His research was excellent. Unfortunately, the storytelling lacked depth and passion. The characters were not sufficiently developed. The senses were not fully engaged in the descriptions, and those descriptions lacked the singularities that capture interest. After reading the book 1/3 through, I realized that getting through the book was becoming a chore. I skimmed ahead and caught all the important plot points with little effort. Sadly, there were no surprises. There's still a great story here, begging to be told. This book hasn't even begun the exploit the potential of the events it describes with such excruciating banality."
4,Great read,Wonderfully written. You can quickly tell that much research was put into this book. I felt as if I was on the ship with the characters. Great story!
5,gripping and good for a historical book..,"All right, I'm the type of reader who prefers fiction to fact and sci-fi/fantasy to all other types of books. However, I picked up ""The Captain's Wife"" mostly because my voice teacher recommended it. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. It was one of the best books I've ever read, and that's saying a lot because I usually don't enjoy anything based on a true story. But this book was wow...just wow. It was so cool to think that a girl just two years older than me was in control of a ship during one of the most dangerous crossings ever.Read it...you'll be glad did."
2,Fact and Fiction Fusion Failure,"I was disappointed by the failure of the author tell a great story. I would have preferred to either read a documentary or a novel. I cannot recommend this poor mix of fact and fiction. I was particularly bothered by Douglas Kelley's attempt to portray her most intimate physical desires. Those paragraphs are out of place, having a tendency to make The Captain's Wife a target for lust. She deserves much better then what Kelley has done for her."
5,James Levine's 25th Anniversary Gala Is outstanding!!!,"Metropolitan Opera Gala - James Levine's 25th AnniversaryThis DVD is outstanding!!! Its a shame that, in the interest of time, some parts were cut from the original airing. Not very much, but the fact that Waltraud Meier (a heavenly Wagnerian soprano) had 5 curtain calls for her amazing performance should have been included. When someone performs to that level of greatness, showing the audience appreciation and recognition is a more truthful way of the reflecting the overall Gala.S. GoldbergMichigan City, IN"
4,Lessons learned,This book teaches you lots of things about having a horse and it is rather interesting.I think it's a great book for horse lovers.
5,"Emily""s choice",I think it was a very informational book I would use it in any time of need so should everyone else.And if you do buy this book you are making a good choice. If you don't know what a horse does or the meaning of the word it's there..
5,best mats,These mats fit perfectly and look good. Just beware they aren't designed to fit perfect if you have the floor 4x4 shifter.
3,The Burning Court,I did not like this novel as well as other novels by the same author. It has to do with the supernatural.
4,An excellent resource,".... There have been two editions of this book released, the first before the Silmarillion had seen publication. This first edition did in fact contain some guess work (something ""Tolkien Experts"" know all about), but Mr. Tyler's book offers a more comprehensive list of entries (and better written ones) than Robert Foster's ""Guide to Middle Earth"". They are both valuable resources if you want a clearer visualization of Middle Earth."
5,Love these movies,"Haven't watched the 4th movie on this particular DVD set, but the first three movies played great and looked great."
2,Terrible remaster,"I expected much more from such a highly anticipated launch of a frame by frame restoration as advertised. The sound is intermitant, and many screens still have exagerarrated graininess common of low def 70's and 80's flix. Might as well just have a DVD copy, rather than having waited for this. Shame on me; this is the second time I have been burned by Lucas-Spielberg. My respect for these guys is gone."
5,Smooth,"easy, quick, no problems. Just in time for christmas and was a good deal, came without damage. Good buy !"
2,Why release the 4th film in this set?,"I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones films. This would have been a day one purchase from me, had it not included Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This is NOT because I don't like the movie - I do, though not nearly as much as the other movies. The problem is the fact that this film has ALREADY been released on Blu-Ray! Those of us that have it will now have two copies, and of course this forces the price tag up as well. Seems like a bit of a con job...Bottom line: If you don't have the 4th film, this set should be very good. From what I hear, the picture and sound of these movies on Blu-Ray is excellent. However, for those of us that already have the 4th film (or just don't like it) I think it's best to wait until they release them individually."
3,Cheesy fun,"Cheesy fun. That's all it is. If you're expecting realism or drama or the Godfather, you're barking up the wrong tree. If you're looking for 8 hours of cheesy fun, best accompanied by a bottle of vodka, then look no further.And if you're wondering about the fourth movie, don't worry. The ending very clearly emphasizes that Shia is NOT replacing Harrison, and there will only be one Indy :)The only big reason that I can see against buying this boxset is as follows: will this be the last one? I doubt it. Personally, I'm waiting for the fifteen-disc, six-movie box to be released... and you know it'll happen :)"
5,great purchase,"painless purchase and a quick ship. I have no complaints at all! I have waisted alot of gas driving to the mall and the ""superstores"" to find this item with no luck. I found this purchase online and saved alot of money compared to what I would have spent at a regular store."
5,Greeat,I love this set. benn looking for a while. I'm a big Indiana Jones fan. Good to sit down and watch on a rainy day.
3,I would buy this without the skull movie,I haven't actually bought this box set but I would jump all over it if the Crystal Skull movie was omitted from the box set.
4,Part of the adventure series that my son likes.,I purchased it for him because it was on his wish list. I think he has collected all of them by now.
3,does it have to include #4?? lol,"I would give it a 5 star rating bc raiders of the lost ark is one of the best films ever made! and 2 and 3 were also very solid films, but the fourth was such a let down. Guess every good movie franchise has a dud."
5,Excellent resource for all countries,I used this book last year for a research paper and found that it contained all the information I needed about the Canadian health care system. It is a great perspective for considering the US system as well.
5,timeless wisdom for today,"I haven't read any other translation of the Gita, so I don't have any opinion about this translation vis a vis any other translation. However, I can say that this translation is simple to read and understand, and that the message of the Gita has had an enormous impact on my life. I read it every day for guidance and inspiration, and it is a wonderful antidote to the toxic messages that bombard us daily from advertisers and the media. I highly recommend this book."
2,"idea good, writing... not so good","For the most part, this was an enjoyable read. It's a very interesting concept (earth is invaded by a race of aliens who are less intelligent than us). But the concept is really all that it has going for it.Anvil's writing style is not bad but it's also not great. He takes the really cool concept, builds some neat ideas on top of it (like the 'Trap' story another reviewer mentioned), and then does a mediocre job of translating the concepts into writing. There are some passages that are even painfully bad--near the end of the book there's a space battle that is about 20 pages of the most tedious writing I've ever read.If you read a lot of SF, sure, pick this up. You will probably appreciate the good aspects of the book. Just don't expect too much."
1,Save your money!,"The only reason why I didn't return it was that I had already read fifty pages and my wife wouldn't let me return a ""used"" book. Honestly, I haven't read a sillier story in I don't know how long. As one of the reviewers implied, this is veeeeery juvenile fiction that, unlike Heinlein's, is NOT suitable for anyone over age 12 or so. It really belongs in the obscurity of really bad pulf scifi and I have no idea why Eric Flint rescued it when there are so many better scifi authors/stories unknown to today's readers.IF you allow yourself to be fooled by the other two reviews AND you buy this book, DON'T allow your spouse/significan other to talk you out of getting your money back. And don't say that I didn't warn you!"
1,disappointed,I was really happy to see how quickly it came...but as soon as i opened the package i saw it didnt have the needle. I looked at the reviews and i noticed only a certain few of us are lucky enough to get the needle and i dont really know how to speak to the seller when it's Amazon -_-
1,Invisible pump!,The pump never arrived! I would have loved to try it out. Amazon never responded to my e-mail questioning where it was. Obviously I'm upset!
3,Psychedelic edge...,"This is Cream-inspired alternative-rock with a blues base and a psychedelic edge. Hailing from Detroit, this power trio add a few special guests here as well: Toledo's Black Swamp Blues Society's ownDanny ""Mudfoot"" Hubbs, The Psychedelic News Boys, The Urban Blues Review, Johnny ""Hitman"" Reef and Buddy Kincaid on drums/percussion."
2,"Great for Beginners, Not for Others","I would recommend this to beginners who type around the 30 WPM range. I would, however, NOT recommend this typists who type at intermediate and advanced levels. I can type (my fastest ever) at 95-100, usually (fastest) at 80, but on average I type around 75. To people like me that immediately backspace to correct an error, I have bad news for you. Even if you erase your errors, it still counts it as if you had an error. Many more complaints, but I won't bore you."
2,Not for professional shooters,"I guess I have to be the first to give this product a negative review. I have to take some of the blame, though, since I only now noticed the ""USB 1.1"" part of the name. I didn't know anybody made USB in any version other than 2.0 these days, so I was surprised when my 4-gig card claimed it would take 70 minutes to load onto my laptop. Heck, the cheapie card reader I've been using for 3 years goes much, MUCH faster than that. I had hoped to replace that relatively bulky reader with this slim little product, but I'll be passing the Delkin along to my wife's camera bag and keeping the old one for my pro work. Look for another product if speedy downloads are a priority."
3,Quality issue,"It is a beautiful rendition, but the DVD skips in one of the arias of Act 2, Everything else was fine"
4,"Interesting Read, Surprise ending","I thought the story was well written. At slightly over 100 pages, this could be classified more as a short story than a novel. That is a good thing because it does not inundate you with side plots and filler to add pages. It moves along quickly and keeps you interested.The author found a very clever way of tying 2 wars that are 30+ years apart together. The ending really caught me by surprise. I recommend you read it for yourself to find out.I hope this is only the beginning for Boucher."
2,Decent - but not what I wanted,"I didn't find it too useful. Too bad, I was looking for more of a users handbook for the extension - it's more of an explanation of what it can do, not HOW to do it."
2,I didn't enjoy,I thought this book would to approach subjects about hydrology related with GIS.I didn't enjoy this book.
3,Price,"Price is not reasonable to buy to a new comer to the computing inductry, even though book is very good."
5,Great product,"Does exactly what it says. Same price as on the manufacturer website, I think. If you do nothing else to your R1200XX, change the oil...and use this product!"
2,Not for meetings etc,"This is a good voice recorder, if you want to record notes to yourself. However, the microphone is not nearly sensitive enough for recording meetings, presentations etc. Standing just six feet away I could hardly hear myself on the recording. Also, the display is very small and the readout is hard to read. I had to refer to the manual which had a blowup of the display to see what it was showing. On the plus side, it has good computer compatibility, no drivers/software needed, and mp3 recording."
2,"yah, whatever.","okay, good. it IS another Backstreet Book, but It's one of those cheezy teenybopperish tabloids that I'm so opposed to. come on! write something authorized for a cchange, will ya?"
3,Welcome to Groupiedom,"Yes, Winston's kind of cute and tells a good story, imitating Dylan and cracking himself up. But you have to be a real groupie to like this. (I am, and I did.) But don't expect to see or hear Dylan, outside of a few soundless fan home movies on stage. Interesting tour and band stories, but so is Mickey Jones' home movies from the 1966 Tour. If you liked that, you'll like this. Not sure how the drummers keep selling these stories, or why Amazon isn't linking the Mickey story, which is now only $9.99."
3,Modest documentary on drummer,"As has been reported in reviews, Dylan appears only in silent shots of him and never in interaction with the drummer. I should think the film of quite modest interest for any but dedicated Dylan fans. I would advise those who are not quite so dedicated to watch only on the cheap, if at all, since they will be missing nothing surprising about Dylan. The life of a sideman can be quite interesing; this one doesn't rise to that level."
1,More confusing,"I was reading it as first book for most of the topics, It was total waste of time to read it.Might help if you are already well expreinced with .NET but not for beginner"
1,"If you find this book useful, don't take the exam yet.","It is at a very basic level. It can be useful for starting in XML webservices, but not enough for the exam.Some information is outdated.It has errors. So does the practice test.Doesn't cover at least one topic which is in the practice test.The practice test doesn't tell you what is considered the correct answer.If you find this book useful, you're not yet prepared for the exam."
3,Pretty good but not great.,"I'm doing a partial rebuild on my 454. I picked up this book because I know next to nothing about rebuilding motors. This book gives a pretty thorough walk-through, beginning with removing the block, stripping it down, taking it to the machine shop and reassembling it.There's good information in the book. My main gripe is the author assumes you'll be reusing most of the same components that you started with. I had planned to put a hotter cam in the motor and I know I need to check the clearance between valves and piston...none of this is covered. He just says slap the heads back on.This is another book that will probably be nice to have around if you're a beginner."
5,just what I needed,I am in the process of rebuilding two 1966 Chevy cars andthis book not only told me how to do it but also the exacttolerances to set. It will come in very useful.
1,Don't Bother!,Don't waste your time...the characters aren't even as good as cardboard! the writing is juvenile! and the plot is pathetic! Not worth the time or money!
4,A CAMERA FOR BOTH OF US,"I've finally found a very reasonably priced 4MP digital camera that I like and my wife will use! We both like the 20 best shot modes that include a on screen detail description of each so that you understand how to utilize each mode. The menus are self explanatory and very easy to move through. It also gives me some manual override features that I like.My only con so far is that pictures using the digital zoom appear pixelated on a 4x6 print from a photo lab. I would not expect it so noticeable on print this small with a 4 MP resolution. The only other surprise is that there is no sound with the video.One option I did like was being able to resize a picture to a smaller resolution. This is great when your memory card is full and you don't won't to delete any of the pictures to be able to take another picture.Remember this is a $200 camera. Personally, I think the QV-R40 is easily the best value for the dollar."
1,garbage,this gage is garbage i ordered it and received it and called the company and told them it didn't work they told me to send it back on my dime so i asked for their manager they lied and gave me another employee which in return also lied seems to me their a very small co with bad product and management!
5,Neat little knife,"I like having a little pocket knife with me. Having something in my pocket to hold a few dollars and be able to cut open envelopes and boxes is a huge convenience. I absolutely feel naked without it (like when flying) and frankly I keep a brand new one in the box and ready for the inevitable times every couple of years when I lose one from my pocket.It's not perfect, every few months I have to tighten the blade pivot screw and occasionally attempt to sharpen the bevel on the one sided of the blade.I've had several small pocket knives over the years and so far this is the best. It's *there*, it doesn't break, and I haven't cut myself badly...yet."
2,not my cup of tea,The book was a tad dry from the get-go...I only read maybe the first 10 pages and couldn't stand it. Sorry!
3,Futon sofa bed frame,"This queen size Savannah futon sofa bed - frame only is over priced. Very uncomfortable futon, no longer in use."
5,You need this book,"This book saved my sanity. It is great because it gives you choices and options so you chose what you feel comfortable with. Three friends had babies about the same time I did, they could not believe how great my son slept. I loaned them the book, now their children are amazing sleepers."
3,Mr. BBQ meat tenderizer,This item works out great because I do alot of grilling and it makes it easier than using a fork.
5,The great and terrbile quest,the product came in excellent shape and I was very happy with how quick I received it. Thanks.
5,The Great and Terrible Quest,"This book is currently back in print. I found it for under ten dollars from Sonlight Curriculum. It's my 14 and 10 year old daughters' all-time favorite book. We actually wrote the author, who is over 90, and she very kindly wrote us a lovely letter back. It's a terrific adventure story and really stretches the imagination as you keep wondering how the characters in the book all fit together. The little boy, in his unselfishness and bravery, is a true hero."
1,Terrible! Does not stay together.,"I never leave reviews, but this was such a bad product, hoped I could spare some other parents the mistake of buying it. I bought for a six year old girl for Christmas. The directions are fine and easy to follow, however, the whole thing is assembled with double sided tape which does not hold it together at all. The hair was supposed to self-stick with velcro which also did not work well. The only way to salvage this doll was to get out a needle and thread and sew all the clothes and hair on. Otherwise, the whole thing would fall apart before you even had a chance to play with it. It is very cute assembled, but definitely not a real, workable project for a kid."
3,Somewhat disappointed,The tips listed in this book are fairly common sense ones. The recipies are organized poorly--all lumped together in an A to Z fashion. I don't feel any closer to being able to feed my family a MEAL for $5 after reading this book. Some of the recipies do look intersting though.
5,Great product,Great product. I really like it it feels like my bike goes faster now. I recommend this product to anyone.
4,Brings Back Memories.......,"A previous reviewer wrote ""only fit for the people who grew up watching this kind of dreck"". Well, I AM one of those people and I'm thrilled to have this tape, since when I was a kid, nobody had VCR's.I do agree that the nostalgia value surpasses the entertainment value, but for me the nostalgia value is great, since I've been out of Jersey for almost a decade now.It's too bad they couldn't include the musical guests. I'll never forget being introduced to the Ramones, Squeeze, and NRBQ by their good humored, but terribly lip-synched, performances on this low-budget show. I also remember the thrill of drawing a picture, and then seeing it on TV in a few weeks on Floyd's wall!"
1,Painfully unfunny,"I bought this mostly out of curiosity as I'm mostly familiar with Floyd's current Italian radio program which I put on for my mother every week. She didn't get any of the humor at all; I understood it, I just didn't find it funny. ""Julia Stepchild"" stretching out a 15-second gag of pouring chocolate syrup over a stuffed moose (chocolate mousse, get it?) for a 5-minute routine was groan-worthy. It seemed the less funny the skits were, the longer they dragged on. And the guy constantly laughing and guffawing offscreen was annoying. Based on this video alone, I have no idea how the show appealed to either kids (for whom some of the jokes would have gone over their heads) or adults for as long as it did."
1,"Does not function correctly, unhelpful customer service","Don't buy this player. I recently bought this after my Archos 20 MultiMedia self-destructed (don't get me started on that piece of junk!) and expected it to be flawless. Unfortunately, after loading 280 + songs, all I get now is ""Player either not connected or busy."" It will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do. Don't buy this player."
1,Piece of Junk,"I am a soldier serving in Baghdad right now. I bought the Nomad when I went home on leave and it worked great for about a month. The other day when I was listening to a song, it locked up and will not do anything now. It says I have a harddisk problem. And since I'm out here I can't mail it back under my 90 days and they won't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty. It worked good for a while. It did lock up on me a couple of times. And then it just froze and now I'm out $300 for their piece of junk."
1,Very Bad.,"I am A haunted mansion fan as well as a haunter. (Extreme halloween dude.) I can only say that who ever thought that it was a good idea to put this crap on this cd should be fired. This is the worst cd I have ever had the pleasure of sleeping through and then wanting to set on fire. The one, and I mean THE ONE AND ONLY reason for my one star is for the beautiful score by mark mancina. Although, they should have just put a cd full of the music out of the movie, but no! They had to make him do something else! DON'T BUY THIS CD IF YOU ARE A MANSION FAN! It is a big let down."
1,Where is the score from the Movie!,"If I wanted Halloween music I buy a Halloween CD just for that occasion. What I wanted was the score from ""The Haunted Mansion"" movie. What a deception! I can only hope that they will be fair to the composer, Mark Mancina, and release just the original motion picture score from this movie on another CD. A score which was beautiful written and performed. Be sure to check the song tracks before you buy this CD because there is only one piece of music from the motion picture. Don't waste your money!"
1,Utter Garbage,I normally read the reviews before I buy this time I did not. If your looking for the score to the movie forget it. I cannot express in words what a total piece of worthless garbage this CD is.
4,Good Album,"This is a pretty good album if you enjoyed the Hanted Mansion Movie. Its pretty hard to hear some of the songs in the movie. I played this CD several times before seeing the movie on opening night and couldn't pick out some of the songs.If you are a Haunted Mansion fan you are much better off getting the Haunted Mansion CD in the Theme Parks since it contains the entire sountrack of the ride itself! (Not available on Amazon.com)My favorite songs, on this album, are 'Man With The Hex' by the Atomic Fireballs and 'Somebody's Watching Me' by Morris Day."
3,Just for Laughs,"I bought this soundtrack just because it was something dealing with Haunted Mansion, not really for who was on the CD, but I do have to say, it is rather good...but had nothing really to do with the movie. These songs would be good for like a child's halloween party, or ""Man with a Hex"" would be good for a dance class while teaching swing. Otherwise, it's not the best. The only songs I listen to are ""Superstition"", the Rockwell cover, ""Dead Man's Party"", ""Man with a Hex"", and the music score."
5,A Falsehood - Revisited !,"Falsehood in Wartime: Propaganda Lies of the First World WarClassic debunking of the propaganda lies politicians and press manufactured about the enemy to stampede their own citizens into ""the war to end all wars."" British MP Ponsonby reveals how all the belligerents, but foremost his own country, faked documents, falsified photos, and invented horrifying atrocity stories. Authoritatively debunks numerous wartime hoaxes, including such durable tales as: the bayoneted Belgian babies, the German ""corpse factory,"" ""The Crucified Canadian,"" the martyrdom of Nurse Cavell, and the ""passenger ship"" Lusitania. In the publisher's foreword, historian Mark Weber points out fascinating parallels with World War II atrocity tales."
3,Way too little to offer!,"I purchased this book to help me determine the best literature to use with teens as part of a bioliotherapy group. This book was far from what I expected based on the description I read. First, this book only contains 6 or 7 book recommendations, and while they are well-analyzed for the varying issues/therapeutic components they contain, 6 books is not much to choose from.Each section of the book tackles a topic such as an eating disorder or sexual identity and then pairs a novel with that topic. Each novel is described in brevity and then this is followed by a psychoanalytic explanation of the characters, plot, conflict, etc.If you're wanting a comprehensive list of fiction that touches on various therapeutic topics... this is not for you!"
5,Amazing book!,"Anyone interested in the White Mountains of New Hampshire will be fascinated by this compelling account of Joe Dodge, the real Old Man of the mountains. Putnam weaves humor and tragedy with his own personal knowledge of the man who was perhaps most responsible for the modern perception of the Northern Peaks. AMC Hutmaster, pioneer SAR organizer, co-founder of the Mount Washington Observatory, organizer of the legendary Inferno races from the summit of Washington to Pinkham Notch, it's all told in this wonderful book."
4,great read,"What a great book. I live in the area and the weather on Mount Washingtonis very unpredictable. It's has been said ""it's the worst weather in the world"""
3,Great Artwork somewhat confusing story,As i said it has Great artwork but the story is a little confusing. It's was packaged neatly and arrived undamaged
2,wonders of gods creations vol 1-6,The matrial covered is non demomotional whicj is greatly open the doors to learning and creating an open forum for discussion. However the picture quality is poor. It does not match with the standards of our higher resolution television and dvd player capabilities.
2,cheesy,"These videos seem to use old video and interviews, outdated computer graphics. The date says 2005 but it comes across as being produced in the mid-eighties. Very boring subject matter, the whole set could have been boiled down to one or two dvds. The Christian message is very watered down and not a significant topic of discussion or instructive at all."
1,What a hypocrite!!,"I bet this woman is an awful parent, she seems so incredibly insincere in her words. I pity the boy that would have to be raised by someone like Ann Laforge. Speaking of which, the boy on the cover is the cutest thing in the world!!"
3,Comment on watchband resizing,"I have the yellow version of this watch...which I reviewed in July '07 and can be found atInvicta Men's ll Collection Silver-Tone Yellow Dial Watch #4243; I was looking at this red version and noticed that one reviewer had a bad experience with resizing his band. I resized mine with Invicta's watchband tool, and it pushed out the pins...that is, they were not screws, but pins [the direction to push the pins is indicated by an arrow on the band itself]. If this red version has the same band, then possibly that is why the reviewer had a difficult time...and possibly the jeweler did not realize they were pins.Just something to consider...I'll know better if I get this color!"
1,Loose five minute per day,"Yep, it looses around five or six minutes everyday. I think it is enough to say."
2,Poor description on bag dimensions,"The dimensions for this camera bag are advertized at ""2.2 x 3.2 x 7.2"". This is false. The actual dimensions on the Z10 packaging are 3 X 1.25 X 4.25. Had I known the bag was this small I would have ordered something larger but then you are trusting the website to advertize correctly. It is a good quality bag but holds only a small digital camera and not much else. I guess you have to go to a manufactuter's website(In this case Lowepro's)first to confirm the actual size."
5,Great product,"I ordered these and was so pleased, I ordered a second pair as a spare. They fit perfectly over my glasses and protect from all sides. They are not bulky or uncomfortalbe. I use them for yard work with my string trimmer and devices that potentially throw debri. I also use them in my work shop. In addition to protecting my eyes, they protect my expensive prescription lenses. Well worth the great price."
5,Does what a goggle should do,"Covers half of my face pretty good and protects them nicely.Only thing is since it's made of plastic,they get scratched easily, so after a few months of use mine got a little foggy.Good product for students out there who use it once in a while."
5,Inexpensive and absolutely perfect for shooting,These are sturdy and fit easily over my glasses without being crazy huge. I've loaned them to a contact lens wearer who found them comfortable and completely serviceable as well. A great deal whether you wear specs or not.
5,Looks like a new classic on Architectural Acoustics,"I just received my copy, and have yet to dive into. However it appears up to date (2006) in that it covers modelling and auralization concepts. The scope of the book is expanded compared to Eagan's excellent text. Take a look at the table of contents on line for an idea of the topics.It appears to be well written. The mathematics of sound are covered. This should be a standard reference text for a general knowledge of architectural acoustics.July 2007 - I use this book as one of my primary references. It has excellent breadth and detail."
4,Very Nice,"The ultimate guide to architectural acoustics covering many topics in a single and nice priced book, It has everything covered and explained to a good level, my only complain is that only basic measurement techniques are explained. However it is a great complilation of knowledge in a single package."
4,Where only the Bold should go,"I've been folding for over 30 years, a member of several origami organizations. I found this book to be great far as the model shapes and looks. But some of the models require some moves that have no definite landmarks and it takes several tries to ge the porportions correct so that the model looks right. Also, most of the models expose both sides of the original paper. If you use standard origami paper this results in a half colored model. I didn't find any moves that were super hard, but careful attention must be paid to the text instructions. Overall, I found the book to be inventive, and well presented. If you are not a purist when it comes to origami, you should find this book a good addition to you library."
3,Interesting book.,"This book is interesting and the models look nice. What is not made apparent in the description is that most of these models do not follow traditional origami standards. My meaning is that most of the models require some kind of cutting and assembly and are not made from one uncut square. The people complaining about the complexity of the models are obviously not into origami. They are just trekkies that thought the book would look nice in their collection. If you have done origami for 10+ years like I have, none of these models are challenging."
4,The Long Patrol,"I chose this book because I thought it would be a good book because I have read other books about this Redwall series. The first book I read was the Pearls of Lutra. I thought it was great so I decided to read this book. It was kind of boring at the beginning. Later, it started being fun.The main character in this story is a young hare whose name is Tamello De Fformelo Tussock otherwise known as Tammo. He is brave,loyal, and shows compassion for anybeast that helps them or is helpless. He sometimes made some dumb mistakes. He is young and bright, and makes many friends and enemies. He also is a good sport, not like some people in this story.The book was hard to stop reading once I got into it. Even though it is 358 pages long it took me only about 2-3 days to finish it. I thought the story plot was great, and I beleive that Brian Jacques is a good writer and has a good imagination. All his books that I have read were great. That's why his Redwall books are #1 best-selling books."
1,The Long Patrol,"My grandson who is in the fifth grade was assigned this book to read. Although a straight A student, he found it most difficult to read. I have two masters degrees and found this book to be one of the most difficult for children to read. A book like this can certainly cause students not to want to read at all. The dilect was most diffficult to follow. While the story of animals is appealing to children, the dialect is much too hard and simple names would make the story just as interesting. I realize that I am in the minority with the other reviewers but this is my honest opinion."
4,beginning star gazing,"my son is 6 years old and has recently gotten interested in the world of science. stargazing and finding constellations has been a big interest of his. this book is easy for this age group to follow and changes subjects frequently enough that they don't get bored. they learn about the night sky and some of the words are also easy enough that he reads some of it himself. the only drawback of this book is the ""man in the moon"" picture seemed to scare my son a little but he still pronounces it his favorite book...""just not the scarey part""!"
4,"No Baby Pony included ""don't fall for it!""","Got this pony for my little girl and although it came quickly there was no baby pony. So please, DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!! IT IS NOT INCLUDED!!!! I thought maybe they had forgot to pack it until I read everyone elses reviews. Should I say more, next time... I will read the reveiws instead of being so impulsive in my purchases which I sometimes do. I'm going to keep the pony, but please, remember to read what others have to say first!!!...And I am talking about myself mostly."
3,Good at first,"This toy was very fun when we first got it. After playing it non stop for a week or two, it got really old and boring. This toy is small, yet durable. It is not very educational, but good for sleepovers, parties, etc. Overall, this toy is OKAY."
4,"Animal, Vegetable or Mineral",I love Twenty Questions. My grandchildren enjoy it too. In fact the one I bought recently is for my young grandson. He requested it. He's learning to read and this game is helping him. One good thing to know about the game is you can't pick an obscure subject for it to guess - you should stick with ordinary things. At least that's what we found. I recommend Twenty Questions. JT
3,"good premise, heroine needs a good slap","The heroine in this books sure ruins a good read. She was so bent on her ""needs"" that she appeared very selfish. I found myself wanting to ""slap"" some sense into her!"
4,Put the lime in the coconut and mix it all together~,"Maybe this fragrance is more deserving of 3 stars because of it's short-lived scent life, but I enjoy this luscious fruity scent so much that I just HAD to give it 4 stars!*Fragrance notes include banana, apple, coconut, lime sugar, sandalwood, amber and musk.Tips/Comments/Suggestions involving Escada Pacific Paradise:1) I'd say the scent strength is moderate . . . a little strong and uber sweet at first, but just like it's scent length (which I would estimate is only a couple of hours) it doesn't last long . . .2)I'd say this perfume is for casual, daytime use . .While it IS a fun perfume, I'd get something else for an evening in town or whatever . .3) This perfume is great for Teens AND adults alike . . .as long as you're young at heart and like the scent I really don't think it matters what physical age you're at :-)"
2,Childish and overpriced,"The puzzles are not that challenging, and the book is slim but costs almost $10. It was a disappointment overall."
5,Great Deal! Very Satisfied Consumer Product!,"I bought this product in a different shade at first (light brown), since I work in a lab and needed some good sole support for long hours on my feet. The moment I tried them on, I felt like I was walking on super plush carpet and it fit like a ""glove"" to my feet. I walked around the house in them all day; the fit was just perfect. I was so pleased I had to return for more and decided I needed to buy a pair for my mom. So I got her the dark brown. The cut on these was a bit smaller and narrower above the arch of the foot, but I believe they would suit her well and am happy I found a sturdy, comfortable pair of shoes. Great Product... Highly Recommended for comfort, style, and ease."
4,Useful and Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well written book. After a long and detailed account of Evagrius life and works, which forms Part I of the book, the author turns his attention to the Letters (On Faith; Letter 7, 8, 19, 20; The great letter).Subsequently we find an interesting analysis of some of Evagrius' Treatises (The causes for monastic observances, and how they compare to stillness; On thoughts; A word about prayer).Thirdly, Evagrius' Notes (Notes on Job; Notes on Ecclesiastes; On the 'Our Father'; Notes on Luke) and lastly, the Chapters (To the Virgin; Excerpts; Aphorisms; Definitions; On Prayer).The sequence has been carefully chosen to present easier writings first and more difficult or demanding ones later, so that the reader can become more and more accustomed to Evagrius' thought.Overall, I rate this book highly and recommend it to a large audience, from beginners to more advanced readers."
4,Quick and profound read,Two aspects of Christ's life--both the beatitudes and the Cross--are wonderfully woven together in this quick and easy read. Sheen writes in such a way that any modern-day layperson can read and understand the content in this short book. One of my favorite parts about this book is the amount of scripture he quotes throughout. It ties the beatitudes to the Cross so beautifully that it's hard to read this book and not have a transformed understanding of the Lord's sermon on the mount congruent with his passion on the cross. I would recommend this book to any reader desiring to learn more about Christ's message while here on earth.
3,stick,Seen these at running expo's forever. Finally had to have one. Been a great after run help. Also been very good for a tight neck.
5,A Must for Shin Splint Sufferers,If you have issues with shin splints this is the answer. Use it after a run and every morning and it will prevent shin splints all together (if you have the right shoes).
1,Why you send wrong item?,This is item I am looking for. Unfortunetly the item I recieved isn't the one shown! It is over month and still don't know why showing wrong here! Can someone care about customer at Amazon?
1,What episodes?,"Would like to order this but I've gotten all 4 seasons and don't know if this contains the missing episodes or not. All episodes in USA are all out of order. Missing 13 episodes but there is no list of episodes on this Season 2, Vol 2. There is no way that all missing episodes are on 1 disc and $35.00 is quite high for 1 disc. Will wait for other reviews."
1,"works well, for a couple of weeks","Like almost all solar lighting products on the market, this one fails miserably, and becomes landfill within a month. Worse, to change batteries (and replace the cheap, useless one that it comes with, you must disassemble the product. This did no good in my case, as even after replacing with a fresh battery, it failed to light. The reason, in my estimation, is that the circuitry, the ""guts"" of the light are not water tight. A little rain, a little sprinkler, a little heavy dew, and everything inside is wet. Not a good environment for electronics. Looked lovely for almost three weeks, then it died, never to run again. Save your money and the environment, do not buy these.;"
5,Love this CRAB!,"For those of us who love little crabs...or are just a little ""crabby,"" these are GREAT!"
5,Fantastic bag for a kid,"This is the perfect sized bag for a child. I bought it for my 3.5 year old, and I think it will last until her tweens. Because it is a little smaller than a regular bag, you don't have to fold it before rolling it, which makes it MUCH easier to roll than an adult bag."
2,Endurance Bore,I purchased this video with the hopes of developing a new core routine with some variability. This video is basic and not very motivating. The fancy cover should not sway you into thinking that this will help you expand your core workouts. If you have never done any core workouts then feel free to buy it.
3,"Nice, but...","I bought this stapler new, and I must saw the thing is beautiful to use. I use it for framing so the thing gets a lot of use every day. The only issue I have with it is the magazine for the staples is made of plastic. I did not think it was a big deal until one of my employees let it slide off the roof we were sheating. The magazine broke cleanly in two. The rest of the stapler is very well built, but I think that the magazine should be made of some sort of metal, say magnesium or aluminum. This would make a good stapler, the best stapler in my opinion."
5,i own it,"this gun has worked perfectly for years, so i bought another one.adjustable depth is very nice and the lightweight makes all day shooting easier. highly recommended."
4,A valuable handbook for Leaky Gut sufferers.,If you are a person who believes in the Leaky Gut Syndrome concept then this is a very useful book to have. I personally got a lot of very good ideas from it. If you are blinkered by the drug companies views of what is good medicine then you won't want to buy this book. There is very little information out there published in book form on Leaky Gut Syndrome and this book sets out in a serious way to provide detailed information on what can be done about it.
3,Going Mental,"I'm not sure how The Mentalist has lasted 5 years. It's not a bad show, but there are so many crime dramas on TV and The Mentalist is just one more. Like Bones and Castle, the show has a team of good looking good guys who inevitably triumph over most of the bad guys. The plots of the three shows are pretty much interchangeable, but Bones and Castle have a little more humor and a bit lighter focusing more on the relationship between the two lead characters. If you like conventional network crime shows (this is no Dexter) you might like The Mentalist."
4,another son purchase,not even sure what its about but it must be a good one maybe on prime or something ill be watching to see what hes liking
5,The Mentalist,"I think this is the best show out there at the moment. Simon Baker plays Patrick Jane, a former fraudulent psychic,while being interviewed on TV, taunted and belittled a notorious serial killer called ""Red John"". He returned home to find his wife and daughter violently murdered, along with a note from Red John telling Jane that he caused their deaths. After a stint in an insane asylum, Jane returns and begins working with the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI). His uncanny powers of observation and mental acuity brings to mind ""Sherlock Holmes"", complete with his own ""Moriarty"", Red John. Jane has little regard for the law and will sacrifice nearly anything to take down the killer of his family. He has made it plain that he intends to kill Red John, not arrest him. He has a dark side and will use his powers to kill those that he finds need punishment sometimes lacking in the law. I highly recommend this show. Simon Baker and the rest of the cast really bring this one home."
4,Satisfied my need.,"I needed to fill a gap in my viewing, and this streaming video was a convenient and satisfying means to that end."
1,Shame!,Is this supposed to make me feel proud to be American?Shame on Amazon for carrying this obscene product.
1,tasteless bigotry,"This should be removed from Amazon. I thought this was a responsible retailer. Saddens me to see this type of thing for sale here. Are anti-semetic, anti-hispanic, or other overtly racist and hostile items available for sale?"
2,"It's Cute, But .......","The two things I like about this little red tea pot are its color and style. The things I don't like are its cheap tin top-cover and the paint quality. Right out of the box I noticed an obvious spot where the paint doesn't fully cover the enamel. Plus, there are little bumps or bubbles in the paint on the bottom of the pot. I don't consider this a quality product and would return it but don't want the bother. I certainly don't recommend this tea pot!"
3,Not worth it.,The product works well but rusts easily. I would not buy this product again since it doesn't seem to last long enough
5,Beautiful Modern Copco Red Tea Kettle,The style of the tea kettle is absolutely beautiful. The red color is very eye catching. It matches my kitchen just perfect. It boils water quickly. My girlfriend came over and complimented it so much I bought her just like it but in black. Anyone will be very satisfied with this tea kettle.
1,crappy dvd,"This dvd is using materials mostly from America's game. I understand that Viviendi is making all these dvds but if this is the way they make dvds to make money, I would not recommend buyng this.I would rather rent the dvd from itunes."
2,Out of production,"The NR90AC2 is great. However if you search the Hitachi website you will find amazon sold me, and is still trying to sell, a product which has been out of production for more than a year:* 'The new NR90AC3 has all great features of the original NR90AC2. Owing to the modification of the ANSI standard-101-2002(Portable, Compressed-Air-Actuated, Fastener Driving Tools- Safety Requirements for), the original NR90AC2 model has gone out of production since the 1st of May 2003. To correspond to this, the valve construction was partially changed and the switching device (Change Knob) was added to select the nailer operation between ""single actuation(single sequential actuation)"" and ""contact actuation"". '*All Rights Reserved, Copyright2004, Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd."
4,Great Deal,"So I just bought and used some of these earlier today (bought it at a Ross down the street). I cooked up some chicken and vegetables in my oven though, not an actual bbq, but I'm in an apartment so I had to make do with broil. Anyways the items cooked a lot faster than I thought they would, this item is neat because unlike bamboo skewers these metal ones conduct the heat from the frame into the skewers into the food, so they heat from the outside convection heat and conduction heat from the frame.Overall they're nothing too fancy, its a pretty essential kit. The frame itself is somewhat sharp edged, the corners and the long edges. It be nice if they had ground down these edges before applying the nonstick surface, but I just try not to apply too much force to the frame when folding and unfolding it.It seems a fine enough product, so far I'm content. We'll see how it holds up in durability next!"
3,OK...not great,"It does what it says. It is a good product. Howver, I wish I had just bought some really nice skewers instead. Keep your grill clean, brush it with some oil, and it'll be non-stick anyway. This didn't work too good with grilling shrimp. It keeps the food up off of the grill, so you don't get the grill marks or charring until the food is overcooked. That's my opinion anyway."
3,okay,My husband loves to grill so I got this for making shishkabobs. He was not pleased because the meat did not brown as well. He ended up taking them off the stand and placing them on the grill grate. We are going to try it with vegetables. Will insert a comment later about how it works for veggies.
5,Thoroughly enjoyable--Reads like a novel,"I picked this book up because I had been tasked with doing a lecture on Paul Revere and whether or not he actually made his famous ride. I could not have done any better than this one. The book is chock full of interesting facts, and is one of those that is difficult to put down. I have read many history books, some of which are really dry, but this reads more like a novel, hooks your interest from the beginning and keeps delivering. It relates not only the historical facts, but the human (and often amusing) side of events surrounding the famous ""midnight ride"" and the beginning of the American Revolution. When I give my talk on the subject, people inevitably ask me to recommend a book or want to know where I found such great information, and I always give credit to this book. I highly recommend it."
5,Paul Revere's Ride,The book was recommended to me by the tour guide I had when I visited Boston last fall. David Hackett Fischer helped me to seperate the myth from the man by adding more details about Revere's work & life. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the American revolution.
1,ABSOLUTELY BORING!,"I have seen the other reviews, and to my amazement, the other readers loved it. Everyone has their own opinion. I DID NOT like this book at all. I had to read it for my U.S History Honors class. I HAD to read it, but if I had a choice, I wouldn't have even looked at the damn book."
3,Book for Class,I bought this book for school. So far it is alright. If one is looking into a leadership role it is a good read
1,Uneven Sound Quality,"I purchased this phone for my home office after a colleague recommended it based on her experience. I liked the features, but unfortunately, whenever I called into the office, although they could hear me just fine, I could barely hear the person on the other end; the volume was faint and the quality staticky.I tried moving the phone to different locations, moving any equipment that may interfere, and using different outlets and jacks, but nothing helped. I switched to my cheapo GE corded phone and the sound quality was crystal clear, so the problem was definitely with the Uniden.Had to return it; it was simply unusable."
3,"Good base, wireless handset have poor range.","The base is nice,Pros:it is a true 2 line (2 jacks) many are not. Sound is good. Can control answerer for each line. Ring volume for each line. Good speaker phone. Conferencing.Cons: caller ID works but requires lots to delete. Each one, one at a time, two button presses to delete each, painful. Ringer Volume control is off, low, high, not enough. Wireless handset has a range of 20-30ft until the static starts. This is extremely bad. My first cordless phone in 1980 had a clear range over a 1/4 mile and each subsequent phone has been less with this being 20-30ft. This is the worst feature of this phone.If you need a good two line base and don't care about the wireless features then this is perfect. If you are counting on the wireless handsets as well then look elsewhere."
4,Good unit with some limitations,"Nice unit but a few odd characteristics get in the way. Why is the message retrieval switch harder to reach than the switch to turn off the answering machine. Why is the messaging capacity separate for each line? Why do you have to delete messages as they play instead of by number? The biggest negative: only 2 numbers can be stored per entry. Should allow unlimited number of tagged numbers (e.g., Home, Office, fax, Cell1, Cell2)."
2,Live from Dublin Nearly Killed Us,"When we popped the Live from Dublin DVD in to watch we were looking forward to another excellent Glen Campbell concert. Unfortunately, that's not what we got. Both the performance and the quality of the recording were not up to scratch. It was painfully disappointing, to the point where we had to turn it off. As people who really enjoy Glen Campbell's music, the fact that we never made it to the end of this DVD really speaks volumes.With a number of other excellent, and more recent, Glen Campbell DVD's available, this one is best avoided. It would really only be worth having for the avid fan who wants every recording of everything Glen has made. For everyone else, give it a miss. It's not worth it."
1,Do not buy,"I purchased the manual version of this 4 years ago. At first it was very comfortable but after about 6 months the foam padding became hard, indented and a lot less comfortable. A few weeks ago the legs started to pull apart, Human Touch are terrible, they have no fix and will not sell a new base, and once your warrant has expired you are out of luck. So we are clear I am the only person that sits in this chair and I weight 175IbsI never write reviews I just felt very strongly about this inferior product and company."
3,Mixture varies from great to not so good,"I've ordered this product twice. The first time, I loved what I got -- a great mixture of about half caramel popcorn and half chips and cheese puffs, with a few pretzels as well.I'm not so happy with my second order. The bag seems less full, and there is very little of the caramel popcorn in it. This stuff is so light that they can probably make up for the missing weight with an extra couple of corn chips, but it sure doesn't make as good a snack.I don't know if this product has gotten worse, or if the mixture varies from time to time. My first (good) order was in October, 2007, while the second (not so good) was in January, 2008."
1,This should recieve NEGATIVE stars it was so bad.,"I ordered Robert's American Gourmet Chaos, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24) on October 30th, 2007 and although it arrived quickly and in good physical condition; it was awful. I tried to return it but I was informed it is not an item you can return which has me a bit upset as it costs over $15 and is inedible. When I opened the first package I was assailed with the smell of rancid oil and so I will not be feeding these organic snacks to my children.The date on the items is not past due, so I assume it is a mistake by the manufacturer. I have ordered other of the Robert's snacks in the past and have never had this problem before, but I will be very hesitant to order any more in the future."
1,Endless problem,"I play this game for 8 month and had to stop playing because of extremely bad customer support and endless connection problem. I disagree with critics of UO on subject of ""Pking"" only Player vs Player combat make this game worth to play other wise game like EQ much much better. WORNING: TECHNICAL REQUERMENTS ARE NOT REAL IT'S BARE MINIMUM. BE AWARE OF ADDITIONAL COST! YOU MAY NEED TO BUY 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE AND BOOKS SINCE OFFICIAL MANUAL AND WEB SIDE DON'T GIVE ALL INFORMATION YOU NEED TO PLAY SUCCESSFULLY AND ENJOY GAME. I have a cable modem and PII 350 cpu 128 RAM but connection so bad I couldn't connect for a week! To close to me server on east cost! I play on German shard for same time but connection became so bad that I had to stop and Origin refuse to move me to other shard. It's just too much problems to enjoy this game."
3,Surprisingly disappointed...,"First off, the sword came packaged in bubble wrap only, NO BOX!!!! So much for a surprise gift. Totally see through. UPS guy was having a good laugh with my Wife and brother. Blade seems slightly bent/curved from shipping.Product is good quality, though blade is surprisingly dull. Just above a butter knife. Needs professional sharpening. Very disappointed.Considering a return."
4,Okay light,Bought thinking I could use citronella candles in to help with bugs at camp. Didn't really work as I had hoped but unit does give off light and as others have stated utilizing tin foil on one side enhances lighting from this lantern. Serves a purpose just not the one I was looking for
5,LOVE LOVE THE BOOK,What a great book for actors who are breaking out in the entertainment industry. I found the book to be an easy read and really got the authors analysis of character description. He is right on!
4,comfort,"The shoes are a replacement for a pair I had 20 years ago. Although a different model, they are close to the original. For thank I am thankful."
2,"Great ""movie music"" but not good ""listening music""","While watching the movie I was enthused about the soundtrack. At least, the songs I paid attention to. Most (and by ""most"" I mean ""all"") of the music on this CD is music I didn't really notice during the movie because they flowed with the movie, moving us along, which is exactly what a movie soundtrack is supposed to do. I can't fault it for that. If you enjoy listening to ""movie music"" you can't go wrong with this CD. However, the songs I really noticed had WORDS! There was ""Heart Attack and Vine"" by Tom Waits and ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave. Without these songs and a couple more I noticed but didn't recognize this CD isn't worth my money. I will buy the DVD, though. I loved the movie. I've been a Ron Perlman fan since his days as ""Vincent"" on TV's ""Beauty and the Beast."""
2,Great idea - bad implementation.,Purchased this item for a rabid Georgia Tech fan and graduate who loves to play golf. The tune was incomprehensible and the antennae are just pieces of felt which do not stand up as shown in the picture.
2,"Rerun, Rerun, Rerun...","I couldn't believe the first 145 pages of this book were a rerun of Sarah and Tom's story from the Prairie Winds series! I read that series first and had I known what was in store from this book, I would've saved my money. Nice ending, but not good enough for all the disappointment. Sorry."
2,not that pratical,"The bunny do eat the hay from there but the hay still fall over everywhere, it is pretty messy. If you don't want the hay end up everywhere in the cage, it is better to put the hay in a ceramic bowl then they won't drop the hay while they try.to eat it.Also, you can get this product at the petsmart less than $3 or petco."
2,So so so messy,"I gave it two stars, because I honestly don't think a non-messy hay feeder exists. And at least it holds the hay pretty well and he can get it out pretty easily. However, the hay falls all over the floor and then into the pan below. Maybe I have an aggressive hay-eater :)"
4,toy gun review,Good for dress up. Be caution though when you play around the gun. Other than that its good price and great service.
5,So far so good,So far so good on these bulbs. They worked in my projector and are still working now. I would buy them again.
4,great afternoon father and son had building together,"bought this for my grandson age 7, for Christmas. He and his dad put it together one rainy afternoon and his sister helped him paint it. They all had a great time."
1,Stay Away From Go Video,"When I first bought this machine I was very happy with it. It worked great. However, about 9 months later the screen started malfunctioning. It was under warranty so I sent it in. Now OVER 4 MONTHS LATER I still don't have a replacement. To make matters worse customer service states they don't have visability into when I will get my fixed/replaced. Purchase from Go Video at your own risk."
1,Piece of Junk,"This unit played exactly 6 movies before dying. GoVideo replaced it with a refurbished model, which arrived in non-working condition. In addition, the original 90 day warranty is still in force, GoVideo refused to extend it to the refurbished unit. Sitting on hold now with customer service waiting for a answer... Recommend NOT BUYING any GoVideo product."
2,It depends on what you like...,"Here are the good points about the game... It looks pretty good.Now the bad points... The camera is works terrible. It points you the way it wants you to go. Next, the characters are so small you can hardly find yourself on the screen. This is complicated because there are 4 character on the screen at the same time. At best you can only play as two of the characters. Because it is only a 2 player game. So... all the little figures just get in each others way. It's really silly and chaotic. As far as game play... if you like to repeat steps and like to do things to the letter then you might like this game, if you can put up with the unattended characters running into each other. But this all depends on what you like."
4,Marker Cone set does the job,The marking cones are durable and work well in the gym and out in the park. We are using them for track and flag football to mark distances and sidelines. I am sure we will find other uses for them in the future.
3,You need to give dimensions,Most people will not buy something without knowing the dimensions. What are they?
1,misleading product discription,"The description states that these have etched glass lens, they are plastic, not quite the same. I an very disappointed in the product I received."
2,not happy hardcore!!!,"this is not happy hardcore, this is trancecore. there are only 2 happy hardcore songs on here, song 5 and song 8. every song is writen and produced by scott brown. if you have either ""Happy2bHardcore chapter 4 or 5"" then you already have 3 of the songs. there are only 10 songs. you would think that if an album is called ""happy"" hardcore, it would atleast have happy music on it, but not this one."
1,"No Star, and it should be totally dismissed!","This ""movie"" is a waste of time is what one reviewer wrote, I will agree to that, but my main issue with this film is that it showed the victims of Ridgeway as being part of the problem, that they wanted it. It also felt like watching some horrific B snuff film. It was like the director wanted people to get turned on by what they were watching. I fast forwarded throught 99% of the film, I just could not believe what they did to the memory of the victims, and how horrible this would be for their families. This is by far the worst movie ever made...Cabin Fever would be a better investment! LOLI lived in Tacoma, Washington at the end of this mess, I have been to where these woman were left, and you can still fill the horror left there by Ridgeway, the makers of this movie are sick, and demented."
1,A DVD made for killers....,"This film tells the viewer nothing about the Green River killer. Its poorly filmed (filmed under water?), the sound is bad and the acting is at a grade school play level. It spends alot of time focusing on the murders devoid of context, merely glorifying the violence.Skip it."
5,LOVED!,"Every bride should read this book. It's pretty much the guide on what NOT to do for your bachelorette party. I was reading this book a few months before my wedding and couldnt stop laughing, it's the perfect girly girl read and goes through a fun girl's night with everything in it from girls being girls, guys hitting on girls, how many free drinks they can get, and of course an adorable love story. So cute!! Would def re-read again!"
5,Fun read!,I gave it to my friend the day I finished it knowing that she would enjoy the laughs as much as I did. I thought Zadie's cynicism was HILARIOUS and right on! Fun and easy read :)
4,I like her cookbooks,"Bought this after my husband had a heart-attack at 41 years old. He was determined to eat better with a low fat, low sodium diet so I went searching for cookbooks with recipes I would actually make...no weird ingredients or long preparation. I like this one very much as well as the other one by Plume."
4,Nicolai: Die Lustigen Weiber Von Windsor / The Merry Wives of Windsor,Nicolai: Die Lustigen Weiber Von Windsor / The Merry Wives of Windsor is a recording under the direction of Rafael Kubelík who leads Chor und Sinfonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks on this Decca recording from 1977. The booklet is very short and contains a synopisis. It does not contain any lyrics and not any biographies of the performers. Still very nice performance and I would definitely recommend it. 4/5.
4,Well written,This book is very well written. I highly suggest to whoever wants to buy this book. You will not be disappointed.
5,"To Tell You the Truth, I lied...this album deserves 6 stars","I first heard Joe's single ""The Impossible"" and since it hadn't come out on CD yet I had to at least get my hands on his older work. Over all his debut and self titled ablum (which now has been renamed Six of One, Half Dozen of the Other) has a uniquely different sound then ""Man with a Memory."" Joe's voice was still in its developemental stage, but even then held its clear strong sound. Not quite as well rounded as his newer work, Six of One... does beat ""Man with a Memory"" in its solid acid country base. If your at all a fan of Nichol's, Six of One...is a good place to start in understanding his roots. Check it out, you won't be disappointed...then go check out ""Man with a Memory."" It just keeps getting better!"
4,A quick inspirational read!,"This is a good, quick inspirational read for those days when, as writers, we don't feel like things are going as well as we'd like. It's filled with stories and information from authors who have managed to find success in the publishing world. The sections are short, so as I said, it's a quick read."
5,"Good shoes, particularly for this price","Good shoes. Ordered size 10.5. Was concerned about the size particularly ordering online. The size matches to mine. SOme people say you should order +/- 0.5 - no, it doesn't apply to this item. Shoes fit on me just fine. Shoes arrived sooner than expected. thanks. good deal."
5,you get what you see,"My child wanted ""blue girl"" for Christmas, so we got him this. It is just what you see. The end."
1,Junk,"I purchased this to connect to a weather station. Real simple handshaking, no special drivers needed. Works by dumb polling.However, it doesn't work. I can connect via hyper terminal through a port and it does work, but I need it to act as a slave.I sent IOGear a rather detailed explaination of what I'm doing, and what I've tried - what I got back was a one line sentence telling me to try something I had already told them that I had tried. I emailed them back a second time and I've yet to get a response. It's now been 3 months.I give it a ""1"" rating because it didn't do as it claimed it should, and IOGears technical support was completely lacking."
5,Blaze of Destruction,This is a great starter deck for any duelist. With just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable! After only a few days of practice with this deck I had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months.
4,It changed my life!,"The Toilevator did raise my toilet 3.5 inches, which was just what I needed. I am in a wheelchair 24/7 so getting on and off the toilet is necessary several times a day (and night). I have long legs, so my chair is quite high off the ground which made it nearly impossible to transfer up to it each time. The Toilevator raised the seat up and now my problems are over. The only drawback is my legs barely touch the ground when sitting, so shorter people may have a problem. I didn't want an ugly thick toilet seat, so this solved the problem. My husband installed it and he says it takes some know-how and the toilet needs to be lifted two or three times. If you are not handy, you may need a plumber. However, it is a great product and doesn't look too bad either."
2,NO PLOT,"Adina Hoffman is a poetical soul but this is not a book of poetry. It's a combination memoir, period piece, and mostly an evocation of place. It gives a (slim) view into her life in a neighborhood in Jerusalem. I, like most readers, prefer books that have characters and/ or plot. This book, well intentioned to be sure, has neither. The author never gets a tempo or rhythm going. What a shame. But it is her first book and the mollasses pace that will tire most readers will be a good lesson for a wordsmith who hasn't yet mastered narrative, hasn't gotten the importance of: forward motion, not to say: fast forward."
3,Built for giants,"This is a good quality product. Very comfortable. Way too long, I wouldn't wear them out of the house."
1,Plantar Faciitis,I was hoping this product would relieve the pain in my heel associated with Plantar Faciitis but I was disappointed. It really had no effect at all.Probably is more geared toward addressing muscle pain.
4,Traumeel gel ointment,"It does not burn, does not smell, does not use menthol.Effective for muscle strain."
2,A for effort.,"This movie gets a star for camera work, and one for time invested. I can't believe D1 and Option would endorse this garbage."
1,Too narrow/dangerous bedding,"I bought this item today at a local Babies R Us and, although it is beautiful, I worry about it being dangerous. The basket is very narrow, making the plush bedding too close to baby's face. Also, the mattress will not lie flat (it has a huge buldge, as if it is not made to fit the basket bottom) and the fitted sheet keeps popping off. I am returning it b/c I don't want to take the chance of the baby getting tangled in the bedding or suffocating on the lining."
5,Beautiful basket!,I bought this basket for our baby boy (due in May). It's beautiful and I haven't had any trouble with fitted sheet staying on. I love that (like all Wendy products) the bumpers can be untied and removed if need be. I know our little one will enjoy this for many months!The fabrics are so lush and soft!
4,CG3+2,"This is a great album by CG3. It has nice melodies, weird stuff and interesting interpretations of songs. My favorite songs are definitely Melrose Avenue (a short but complex 7/8 song), Heart of the Sunrise (a great interpretation of Yes' classic song) and Blockhead (a complex rhythmic piece with very nice dreamy bits and some shifting (odd) time signatures). Some are less my taste (Swampy Space, Train to Lamy), but for the musicianship very listenable.Of course the addition of Pat Mastelotto and Tony Levin (King Crimson, Peter Gabriel) give the songs something extra. For CG3 fans a must have. For progrock fans to. Also for other kinds of daring music lovers!!!"
3,STL Cardinal Flag,"The item I selected on Amazon is not the item I got in the mail. Instead of the Birds on the Bat, I got a flag with a huge STL on it."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this waterproof dock, to use on river tubing trips. I read a review where a guy stated it was good for kayaking and thought it would be good for tunes on the river. I was completely disappointed. The eGo works ok when there is no background noise, however, with the sound of the river water and other people having conversations nearby, we could not hear the eGo even at its highest volume. I think the sound quality is below average and the volume is weak. It may be ok for a swimming pool or in the shower, but any amount of background noise will drown this weak system out. Basically it is now a paper weight that I will never use."
5,Great for the shower,"Gave this as a present to my husband for use in the shower. He has used it every single morning since Feb 20th when I gave it to him. It puts out great sound (I can hear music over the sound of shower and through the door)- he is a musician and thinks the speakers are great for a waterproof system. It is easy to use, and we haven't had any problems when its gotten wet in the shower, or when we use it with wet hands. No sensitivity issues with the click-wheel membrane as some members have reported - although it hasn't been completely submerged, either. Planning on taking it with us to beach and pool this summer - no worries about sand or water now!"
1,why bother?,"This would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Basically a bunch of ex-metallers, burnt-out L.A. studio musicians, former bass players for David Lee Roth, and other detritus of the music industry gather together to make a quick buck knocking off their versions of the Pink Floyd's greatest hits.I can't think of a single reason to buy this, unless you're a family member/girlfriend of one of the people on this CD. And even then I'd ask you to reconsider."
1,Don't believe the cover......,This isn't all stars. It's band members from star bands. Poor attempt to be PF. They try hard to add their own twist to great music but fail. Save your money.
1,...,"I just listened to the samples and it is horrible, She butchered such good songs and it sounds like she is whining along to a karaoke machine. Amazon should not be selling [this], and especially for [item price]. Its not even worth 11 cents."
