4,Very stylish and practical watch.,"I bought this watch thru Amazon.com, and I love it! It's very formal and casual at the same time. The only hard time I had was adjusting the wrist band. Once I had a hang of it, it was a breeze to adjust it to my right fit.Don't get discourage by this,since it takes a little bit of time to figure out this and the settings of this watch. Read the manual and you will eventually become familiar with all its functions.Cons: The analog arrows block sometimes the digital time, but this is irrelevant if you know how to read the time in analog mode."
1,Protective mineral crystal protects from scratches???,"Lost my G-shock that I had for 4 yrs last week so wanted a replacement. I found a few different G-shocks but then noticed the Casio Men's EFA120D-1AV. Really liked the look and the price as I have been collecting watches for the last year and have several sporty and dressy watches. Was very pleased with watch when I pulled it out the box. Was a little tough to take of links but finally got what I needed off. Of course I got finger prints on the lens so I cleaned it with my shirt, I always do this with all my other watches and they look the same as the day I bought them. I then notices hundreds of tiny scratches, thought maybe I did not clean it good enough so got wipes and tried cleaning again. Well scratches are still there and this is the first day what will it look like a year from now. It was only $49 but even a walmart special will not get scratched up like that."
3,Mais ou menos,"A temperatura é imprecisa. Os ponteiros so grossos, o que atrapalha para ver a data, horario no marcador digital, cronógrafo, etc. Tirando isso, é um lindo e resistente relógio. Barato. Compensar comprar."
4,good all around watch,This is a cool watch for the price. It has a lot of features that can be overwhelming at first. The minute and second hands do get in the way of the digital info sometimes making it annoying. The only big drawback is when you hit the light button it only stays on for 5 sec.
4,Very good product,"Great way to save on batteries! This flashlight is powerful enough for basic household use, and charge lasts about an hour. I was able to use it as reading lamp at night for a satisfying experience both with respect of charge and luminosity. I like this type of products that can rightfully claim they save you money. I only wish the build was less ""plastic-y"" (they do feel cheap in the hand) and with a retractable hook or ability to attach string to suspend near the bed."
4,Works just fine for me,This mug keeps my coffee hot for about an hour. If you need to keep your beverage hot longer than you should use a thermos bottle instead of a mug.I did have a twenty ounce no name version that looked identical to this mug that was also made in china that the handle broke but it was because I was not being careful with it. I have been more careful with this 24 ounce mug and it has served me well.
1,"this is plastic, not stainless on the inside","I was very disappointed that this is plastic on the inside, not stainless. I don't like the taste of hot plastic. They should update the description as a plastic mug with a stainless steel sheath."
2,Love the thermos... the lid didn't work right where you sip from the cup,The thermos was large and one problem was the sliding piece where you drink from the cup... it didn't seal and slipped back and forth too easily. The lid seemed cheap and mismatched to the remainder of the product.
1,Hmm . . . dont bother,You know when you see a sequeal and you think . . . Why did they ruin the great memory ?This is it . . . Why did they ! Dont bother
1,They do not work,Okay - I just bought these as a Christmas gift for my sons. My sixteen year old took them out of the box and there were no instructions. We cannot get them to work. We turn them on and one light blinks on the chest plate - but nothing happens when you pull the trigger. I am trying to find out if there are instructions to follow or if they just do not work. I will be returning these as soon as UPS is running after the holiday.
2,pinking shears,"The pinking shears have bolts to keep the blades together. The bolts are too thick and prevent the blades from moving easily, even after oiling them."
1,Misleading Title by Questar....Buyer beware,"I bought the blu ray set after reading the previous two reviewers, believing that I was getting the full set.NOT TRUE.Unlike the DVD version, the ""Extraordinary Birds"" on blu ray ONLY has *TWO* programs: ""Hummingbirds Magic In The Air"" and ""Parrots In The Land Of Oz"".The other four programs are NOT included.Sadly, Questar did not help its customers distinguish between the bluray and the DVD editions.They could have done a better job informing potential buyers the program contents in the production description at Amazon.com.Yet they called both sets with widly different contents the same name.The only clue is the blu ray has 110 minutes while the DVD version has over 400 minutes.I checked their website and confirmed my suspicion.Unlike what the previous reviewers said, there is NO blu ray edition of this title that has the entire 6 programs in one set.I am very disappointed."
3,Military Sniping,"The author has a long standing interest in sniping and snipers and has written extensively about the subject in other books. This book is more of an overview of military sniping rather than an indepth examination. That said, it is reasonably comprehensive and the artwork is interesting with a full explanation of each illustration detailing the equipment and the conflict it depicts. If you are looking for a major in-depth look at military sniping there are better books, however, for an understanding of the subject this book is a good primer."
2,I thought this was a dvd,WELL! I wanted this a dvd format for my own personal veiwing enjoyment this never came as such!Let me know when it does I love cane danceing!HAPPY DANCEING!
2,Caos theory,"I was unable to finish this book though it was recommended by a cousin. I just found that I got lost in all the formulas and expected outcomes. but I am sure that it is good research, just not for me."
4,"Entertaining, helps illuminate a different perspective","Actually a rather light read, no heavy math or deep quantitative analysis, but provides a different perspective and relationship among different types of catastrophic events."
1,My Gosh,"If you don't know already by this date, Mr. Lereah has resigned his post in the NAR. He is disagraced all over the internet as a liar (do a Google search) and rightfully so. If he believes what he says, at worst he's an ignorant fool. If he does not he's a lying fool...either way the man is a fool."
1,Not the real thing,The shampoo I received was not the real thing. Either it was deluted or ann imposter product with a similar smell. I usually buy Pureology from a salon so I'm familiar with the smell and how thick their shampoo is. The bottle I received was very thin and runny and didn't have the same iridescence.
1,&#65533;Cancer: How teens feel&#65533;,"Both Sides Now is a book about a woman who has breast cancer. She has two daughters, one a sophomore in high school, and the other one about 9 or 10 years old. The younger daughter really doesn't understand what's going on with her mom. Now Liza (the sophomore), understands and has a hard time coping with it on top of teenage problems! Liza wants to be able to talk to her mom about what her views are about it, but her mom has to many mood swings. The publicity of everyone wanting to know how her mom is doing. On top of that she's dealing with a lot of things with her friends.I personally don't like this book, because it's not an interesting subject for me. But if you like things about cancer, or ways teenagers cope with things this would be a good book for you!!"
3,It is just average,"I brought this after reading many reviews and i understand that not everyone will have the same results. this product is just okay. I dont really think it helped my nails grow much. I am also disappointed with the bottle. For the price it charges, you would think the cap of the bottle would stay in place. Every time i opened the bottle to use the polish, the cap would come off and the stick/brush would still be in the bottle. Even the cheaper sally hansen has better brush quality."
1,Very poor coverage of 7.0,"I recently switched from years of Oracle PL/SQL work to Microsoft Transact-SQL. Having had good luck with other O'Reilly titles, I bought this book. I had high hopes that were very quickly dashed. Many of the examples in this book don't work for SQL Server 7.0 because they are apparently geared toward an earlier release of the product. In my first night with this book, I found no less than a dozen examples that would run on SQL Server 7.0. I was really bummed out and frustrated by this. I'm still looking for a good Transact-SQL book that covers 7.0."
2,Strictly a 4.2 and 6.5 book,"Neither the code on the CD nor the source listings in the book are aimed at SQL Server 7.0. In fact, many of the examples don't work on MSSQL 7.0 because they query system tables that no longer exist (such as sysprocedures). The cover of the book says it covers 7.0, but actually 7.0 is covered only in an appendix. I'm giving it 2 stars because the code examples are antiquated and many simply don't work on the current version of the server."
1,"Reads like a textbook, covers only old versions","I bought this book wanting to brush up on the latest enhancements to T-SQL. I've had pretty good luck with the O'Reilly books, so I thought this one would be my best bet. I was really disappointed. Where is the SQL 7 info? One appendix?! I don't think so!The real problem with the book, though, is that it reads like a textbook. There are almost no insights or expert perspectives in this book. People buy computer books for info and experience. This book's info is out-of-date and its experience is nonexistent. I can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Though I feel like a fink for saying so, book is useless","This is one poor book. First, the lack of SQL Server 7.0 coverage is inexcusable. Based on when the book came out, it should have *focused* on 7.0, not 4.2. Second, many of the queries do not work on 7.0. For example, there's one that queries the sysprocedures table. Sysprocedures no longer exists in 7.0 -- the query will neither compile nor run. There are several examples that rely on the implicit ordering of the GROUP BY and UNION commands. Again, that is gone in 7.0. Also, old style joins are used throughout, despite thae fact that they've been deprecated by Microsoft for years now. Worse yet, none of the new 7.0 syntax is covered at all. There are a number of commands that have changed substantially (DUMP/LOAD for example) and a number of completely new commands that this book omits entirely. This book should not have been published. Save your money."
1,Needs updating,"This book is at least two releases behind the product. Books like this have to track the product, they have to stay up to date. There's no SQL Server 2000 coverage and very little 7.0 coverage (only an appendix - you can't cover the 6.5-to-7.0 differences in an appendix - too much changed!) And even the 6.5 examples are often very dated (old-style joins abound, for example). The book needs a good updating and some better proofreading. I was really disappointed in it."
2,Broken code,"Why do so many of the example queries not work in this book? I installed SQL Server 7.0 when I got this book hoping to work through it over a weekend. I kept running into code that wouldn't run in Query Analyzer. Why? Even after installing SP1, the code still wouldn't work. I liked a lot of the info in this book, I just wish I could actually use it."
1,"Decent book, but misses the mark in many respects","This book was OK, but I was expecting much more, given that it was part of the Nutshell series. It doesn't cover modern T-SQL techniques very well and is poorly organized. Stuff you'd expect to be covered upfront is saved for an Appendix and stuff in the latter half of the book probably should be covered earlier. All in all, I didn't learn much from this one."
4,Mi Destino is this novella,"I've never been fond of novellas. Quite frankly, I thought they were dumb, cheesy, and overly melodramatic. Then i spotted this DVD in a store and I decided I thought I'd give a novella a chance. I'm glad I did. Mi Destino Eres Tu is simply amazing! I was hooked on every minute of it. Especially after the early death in the novella. While the entire series was heavily edited, it doesn't seem so until the 2nd disc. Instead tHe first disc is an edge of your seat experience and the characters are great. Lucero was great as Andrea and quite frankl;y I wish I could've seen the novella in its entirety. I wouldn't mind shelling the bucks for it too. (come on telivisa, release them complete!). THe theme song is superb and made me fall in love with the novella even before I began watching it. There are suprisingly a decent amount of special features. Overall it was a great buy and I'm truly glad to add this DVD set to my collection as one of my favorites!"
2,don't bother,"I bought this after reading all of the rave reviews and was very disappointed. I am 5'9 and 135 lbs, normally a size 4 to 6 with an average bust size. The top was completely unflattering as it smashed down what I do have to make me look flat. Maybe fake boobs would look better in it, as they are ""unsmashable."" I had no trouble figuring out how to put it on, and the material seemed fine for the purpose. The bottoms fit a little better, and look sexy, but the straps do dig in a little if you have any tummy at all. A total waste of $17 for this in my opinion. I gave it two stars because of the bottoms; i plan to ""make it work"" somehow instead of dealing with the return process."
3,Ok,The concept of the outfit is nice but not made very well and the sizes dont fit skinny girls with big chest
2,Below Par,"This book just can't hold a candle to the earlier books in the Rogue Warrior series. The storyline was too disjointed, and the ending made no sense whatsoever. I picked up a hardcover copy of the book in a bargain bin and I still think that I paid too much."
3,not to bad,the book did do ok. would like it to move along faster aolso wording in book could be more condensed
1,Terrible!,"Following the series our pleasantly plump former SEAL ""collaborated"" on with John Weisman, these latest forays into the fiction world are best left alone. Characters are weak, as is the dialgue, and the plot is virtually nonexistant. His new collaboration with DeFelice just does not have the same pizzaz!"
4,Mr. Rock N Roll: The Alan Freed Story,"It's about time a movie was made about the man who coined the phrase ""ROCK N ROLL"" back in the 50'sHe was the main man to host Rock n Roll shows right at the begining.I really enjoyed this movie unfortunately the actor playing the part of Alan Freed looked nothing remotely like him.Apart from that it was worth watching not only for the music but to find out what really went on in Freeds world.Very interesting to watch and worth having in your Rock history collection."
3,Plodding along with Freakwater,"Freakwater seem to have put together a collection of great songs, but the arrangements never seem to lift off, instead they start and finish in the same place. Some of the harmonies between the singers works very well against the subdued instrumentation, and the tempo moves along without any shame or explanation. Yet, if I need to hear this type of music, I can find collections that are much more authentic. It seems these girls could be playing straight 70's rock if they wanted to, probably with similar conviction... -Daniel"
4,Cycling in Sardinia,"The wonderful aspect of Sardinia is that it's like being in Italy prior to World War II. The people in the small villages are still accustomed to the old ways that are no longer found in continental Europe. Neil describes his and Sharon's experiences while cycling there for three months. It's a humorous account of their experiences and the people they met on the island. And it's not just a good story, but he has deftly described the essence of bicycle touring. ""Do we eat to ride, or ride to eat?"" -- a quote from Sharon. Neil is a gifted writer and I would have given the book five stars if it had some photos. Fortunately, if you check out their website, http://cyclelogicpress.virtualave.net, you will find some great photos with rather witty captions. The Sardinia adventure was just a small part of a long bicycle tour and I hope The Lead Goat Veered Off is just the first installment."
1,unacceptable,"I received a replacement c.d. for the one that did'nt work and had the same problem,bonus c.d. works but main disc will not play. I think this will be the first and last time I will use this serviceJoe Lynch"
4,worth the money spent!,"i bought this watch a month ago for my roommate as a gift for her birthday. it looked very nice, not too pricey for the watch it's. she loved it. women with a slightly wide wrist will fit well without having to adjust the links. the dial is clean and easy to say what time it's, visible without having to wear glasses for her. i loved it and might by this same watch for another friend :)"
3,Average product,Not of great quality. Average. There is no space on the pages to write comments or remarks about the photograph.
5,Excellent,Right up there with the rest of the Avalon collection. I love this group so much. This CD is jsut as good as it was raved about on the radio. So glad I got it right away!
5,"Best ""melt in your mouth"" dark chocolate","I want to affirm what other reviewers have said about this chocolate. It is a truly ""dark"" chocolate that is not bitter and thus perhaps too sweet for some who are looking for a bar with a higher cocoa percentage. This melts great and has a very smooth texture. I like it especially because I can place a square between my cheek and gum and it will slowly melt giving me lots of chocolate flavor. I have been having trouble finding it in stores because, I presume, tastes are shifting to a higher cocoa content. I am happy to be able to find it online. I suggest not buying a case in the summer as it could be damaged sitting in a hot truck awaiting delivery."
5,Cowboy State historical sites,"This book, which lists and describes in detail, county by county, major and minor historical sites throughout the state, is one of the best guides to the state (or any state) I know. Each site is given a rather lengthy description of its importance as a landmark in the state. Maps and instructions on how to get to each place are also included. The book is filled with b&w illustrations depicting some aspect of just about every site. Great for travelers in the state, but also useful and great reading for armchair travelers and history buffs of the Cowboy State. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing read,"This is one of those books that you stick with in hopes that the plot gets better. And as it does you realize you are nearing the end and are hoping for something, just to get to the last page and feel like you've wasted your time reading the book at all.A far, far cry from Revolutionary Road, I am done with Mr. Yates."
3,i have nvere listened to this album,this album is to my knowledge...by trans am....it comes in a pretty album cover...i liked it because of this....u should buy it because of this
1,21st century complete guide to the U.S. Coast Guard,"Serves me right for not reading the reviews before buying. This is a [...] and should be taken off the market. I would think the Coast Guard out raged to find this ""book"" for sale. I returned mine with in an hour of down loading it. All the information is high-jacked from the website [...] I hope I get a full refund."
5,Tough read worth the effort,"You will be rewarded for hard work. A tour de force through Greek and Egyptian medical history, proving that yesterday's stories are today's truths. Look for a Hippocratic Doctor when you are ill, even if he won't treat you if you just feel ugly!"
5,A Great Book for any teenager!,"I have read this book three times and still I love it! Every character in this book, from Lang, who is comfortable with his homosexuality but afraid of coming out to his friends, to the bitter ex-rock star Nevada, and the french Audrey Hepburn look alike Hugette who is sent to the states from France to distance her from her grape-picker boyfriend, are so human you feel a commection to them, even if you're not gay, rich, or a tennager. Just read this book!! You will not be dissapointed!"
3,A little overrated imo.,I like this album but it's not really something I am going to put on a lot. Their other albums improved upon these types of songs quite a bit imo. There are some great tracks but a lot of them just seem to aimlessly carry on in a lower key that just doesn't really jump out at me as worthy of 4 or 5 stars. I give it a 3.5 overall as it lacks that certain great couple of tracks that pull me in and keep me listening. Still it is a solid debut. Jacking The Ball is one of my favorites for sure but I don't think what follows lives up to that song except for a few of selections. Take that as you will.
2,I Love The Show But DVD Set Is A Disappointment,First off the set is only 3 discs and not 4 as described. I was hoping I had a defective set or not the right one. I am still watching the first disc and one show was cut down to a little over 3 minutes. Once I found out my set is not defective I have started watching it again. I love the show and the scenes that are on the set. I just wish they advertised that it is a compilation of the last 2 seasons and not complete. I hate how the music industry controls the rights and makes it impossible to release tv shows the original way they were made and broadcast.
5,Under the Munka Moon 2,I was in some store and heard such a beautiful song that I had to ask for the artist name.This artist appeared to be Alice Russel - whose name I never heard before.I bought this CD and it was great. Almost every song is a hit. I listen to it every day when I am on the road. Recommend to everyone.
4,Most wanted,Some good moments but not my favorite storyline ever. I did like the battle with the Wrecker however. I also enjoyed the Most Wanted Files at the end. Great art and really sweet color job!
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Coming out of the mini-series a while back, the Avengers have to work out what to do with the most powerful hero going, who is serious schizoid, and his own and everybody else's worst enemy.So, of course they sign him up, after he helps keep them alive in the Breakout.This does not mean he will not destroy the planet afterwards, but that is a risk they have to take, unfortunately."
1,The book that never ends. . .,"I'll sum it up in two words: inaccessible and redundant. Arthur Phillips had a good idea, but I think he could have done it justice within the page constraints of a short story. For the first 100 pages, each chapter is basically a repetition of the chapter before with only slight variances. The language is pretentious, so much so that Phillips loses his meaning. I found myself rereading sentences, but finding them so obscure that I wasn't able to make much sense out of them. Also, there is little to no character development, and the characters aren't terribly established at the beginning, so you're not really sure if their behavior is in character or not. If you are simply dying to read this, get it from the library and don't waste your money."
3,LTP1165A-1C Classic Analog Bracelet - Women,"Baterry is dead or so. Watch is not working, I had been through the instruction manual and tried to make it run,but I thing vendor has shipped me the watch with dead Battery. May be I would have to return it, not sure."
5,LOVE THIS WATCH,"This is my third time purchasing this watch. I dropped and broke the face of the first one, left the second one at airport security and purchased this one. I love it and it is my favorite everyday watch. I get compliments on it often...Just FYI, my 2nd watch was found by TSA and returned to me, so now I have a spare for the next time a mishap strikes!! I'M SO HAPPY! I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a stylish, low cost option."
4,4.5 stars is really well-deserved,"The novel was very, very unique in style and content. I was expecting skin, (...), and all sorts of off the hook sex, but what I got was a serious look at reality of friendship, family and relationships. Man, shoot, the author made me want to leave the one I'm with. BUt, I sense she was holding back something because Keisha and her drama deserved a little more play, but I suspect something is coming in the way of a continuation. I hope so. The author kept it on the realllll!!!!!"
1,Not as objective as I though it would be,"I was interested in reading a book about children spirituality that approaches the topic from a scientific (or at least analytic) point of view so I could make my own opinion. Tart's book is biased from the beginning: his goal is to convince the reader that child spiritual experiences are indeed similar to experiences of great mystics (Christ...). Though I have nothing personally about this hypothesis, Tart does not attempt to build his claim on well chosen details of child experiences. In contrast, child experiences are presented in a non-ordered way (or at least an order non explicit to the reader) so it is hard to make anything out of them. Also, Tart rarely quotes children. Instead he rephrases what he though they were saying.The topic and the material (raw child experiences) is good, the writing and the organization of the book is horrible."
5,A parents surprise.,"This book provided a multi-sensory experience that I was not expecting. Having both of my children now in their twenties, I thought this book would remind me of the precious times spent in awe of my childrens many moments of wonder. It did provide many memories but they were not all of the second-hand kind. Reading the first pages I was transported back to my own childhood. I was torn between devouring the entire book in one sitting or stopping to savor each delicous memory. I chose the latter and am so glad I did. Dr. Hart has proven to me that you are never too old to connect with your own spiritual innocence."
3,"Very Handy, but $$$$","We are using the Makita chainsaw for trail work and thought the extention handle would be a good addition. It was paid for out of club funds, so price was not as much of an issue, but I thought it was a bit much. That said, it does work flawlessly and have cut a lot of overhanging branches and limbs with it."
3,A small gem,This publication is rare and very limited in content but a good reference to have for Van Day Truex. Hard to find much about him.
3,This edition is not the one you want...,"The above-pictured edition of this book is the first edition. You want to look for the revised and expanded second edition (blue cover, same photo) for a much better read."
4,Whitens & Brightens Coat Wonderfully!,We use this shampoo on our dalmatian. We only bathe him about once a month and everytime he gets a bath there is a very noticable difference in his coat. It doesn't affect his black spots at all. I hate that it has to be left on for 10 minutes (try keeping a wet dalmatian in a bathtub for 10 minutes!). We only manage about 5 minutes and it still does a great job!
3,A Night With Margaret Price,"Margaret Price's singing, in this recording, sounds like work to me. She attacks each phrase and rolls through them like a heavy machine. Her interpretations are correct, not moving. Sometimes she seems unable to keep the natural spin of air buoyant, making the vibrato too heavy in the mid-voice. This makes it hard for her to sing arias like ""L'amero Saro Costante"" and ""Dove Sono"" with the rolling, floating movement necessary to bring out the character and musicality of each piece. It is when she comes to the Mussorgsky lieder that she really begins to sing; this is when she really shows off her vocal tone and ability to interpret."
4,Excellent portrayal of the artistic process...,"This movie is the story of a woman that wishes to become a film-maker. She becomes obsessed with an actress from the 30's - and begins searching for information on her, and films a documentary in the process. Soon, the lead's love life begins paralleling the actress that she is researching.This film can be viewed on several levels... as a (lesbian) love story... a romantic comedy, if you will. It can be viewed as a story about African American women finding their place in an urban society. Or it can be viewed as a study of the creative process.The love story bored me (luckily both Cheryl Dunye and Guineviere Turner are both really hot!)... but the exploration and struggle of the artistic journeys of Cheryl was very interesting. Any film-maker, artist, photographer, etc. would enjoy this movie... and it should not be dismissed as another silly, unrealistic lesbian love story."
4,This is a wonderfully creative film with a great storyline.,This movie was so creative that I've been searching for a copy of it. It was just great. The excellent story shows what an endless imagination Cheryl Dunne has.
4,"Early, Middle, Late quartets.","Sorry about this! Only a very quick comment.The Tokyo quartet is very good (almost wonderful) in the Early quartets; good in the Middle quartets; but disappointing in the Late quartets. They seem to not be able to interpret some of the depth and sufferings from quartet #12 onward.This group is super in all technical aspects, possessing an especially beautiful tone. Perhaps that's why they do so well in the Opus 18 works and kind of slightly not up to the task in the late ones!?"
5,One I couldn't put down!,"This is the first of Jane Feather's novels to read- but I will definitely pick up some more. I loved this one and read it in 2 settings. I was actually a little hesitant of reading it because I have already read several books set during the 1500's in England and am starting to get a little tired of them. But this one was just different. It held my interest from the very beginning to end. It was fast paced and I was able to feel what the characters were feeling. I enjoyed all of them- even the annoying Pippa, the 4 or 5 year old who ran her mouth continually. One of my daughters was like that at that age. The love scenes were testfully done and did not get out of hand. It was more realistic than some, too. I was glad they did not jump into the bed right off- and he wasn't demanding of it. It was just a great book. I am getting it for my library and will recommend it to everyone!"
3,Just what I need...,"to read another book about a woman so beautful men marry her over and over and over again. Please, ladies, unite with me here. Where DO we average women go? Before you contemplate drowning yourself, a reminder - these people didn't exist. The only gripping part of it was the tangle created when the woman is in the position of losing everything over rumors of her questionable loyalty to the King. That at least was believable. The rest - not really all that exciting."
2,Informative in an eclectic way,"This is a good phrasebook... but really not for the phrases itself. The best part is the cultural tidbits that are sprinkled throughout the English/Vietnamese section. The book gives such helpful tips as ""Don't kiss your partner in public"" and ""Riding on pedicabs is dangerous.""The words selected were very basic and the approximated pronunciation spellings were inaccurate.Also be warned of a page marked ""Colloquialisms"", in other words, profanity. I had the misfortune of trying these out and my listener, though a close friend, was very offended.Not a bad buy for the money, but I wouldn't pay any more for it."
3,Better guide book than some.,"The book is a travlers phrase book and mini dictionary. Small enough to fit in the pocket.I think it's much better than the Lonely Planet Vietnamese phrase book and it costs a dollar less too! There are ""cuss words"" titled Coloquialism on page 142. I can't imagine why anyone would want to use them on a trip (i.e., don't do it). So forget that page, and enjoy the rest of the book. Plenty of tips for travelers, like using mosquito repellent after dark because of the possibility of Malaria.A very useful little book."
2,Psycho-speculative Biography,"Although very well written and interesting at points, Wilson's biography, in some ways, tells us more about Wilson than Lewis. I label the effort ""psycho-speculative biography"" because Wilson, writing as an outsider to Lewis' world (he did not know him personally), takes bits from that world and speculates, offering his own inferences on the data. Rather than adding a strong note of objectivity, Wilson's lack of contact with Lewis, obscures the man. By contrast, one should see the book ""C. S. Lewis at the Breakfast Table,"" a delightful collection of essays, reflections by those who knew Lewis over a span of decades. The Breakfast Table book is wonderfully honest about Lewis' flaws, but what emerges is a much more faithful look at those characteristics that made Lewis such a compelling figure: his wit, intellect, love of beauty, love of life, love of friends, and, yes, love of God."
5,Very insightful!!,"It is an easy to read insightful book that should remain in your bookshelf for years to come."""
4,better than Birdman!,"If possible, this is a much better read than Birdman. Idon't agree that only the strong-of-heart can read MoHayder. She's an excellent writer, and the psychologicalside of the mysteries she writes is just as compellingas the murders themselves. Birdman was a little hardto take, but this is a really wonderful read, and I, for one,can't wait for her next one."
4,well treated,"The treatment is not a unique crime novel but it manages to stand out thanks to the detailed characters gloomy atmosphere and ironic ending.Taking place in a London suburb, DI Jack Caffery finds himself chasing a phsyco paedophile who mercilessly abused a family and left their 8 years old child to die, before he could ""treat"" another family.In addition to the intensive work on the unfathomable crime Caffery has to endure the horrifing resemblance between this offence to his liitle brother's disappearance years ago.The novel starts slow but picks up the pace as the story evolves up to the storng and troubling climax.The treatment is a very good read which will satisfy most mystery lovers."
4,Bit nasty but well written,"Plot has many similarities to the first in series with Jack still searching for answers in his brothers abduction as well as working on a challenging case and dealing with his girlfriend's problems. Tension runs throughout as the police investigation snakes along while the perpetrator repeats his crime. While this is an excellent police procedural I gave it only 4 stars as it is not quite up there with the best of class. The repitition in this and the first book in the series is a little annoying. While they are totally different crimes we have similar devices for spinning out the investigation. Shoddy police work and faked reports on grunt work, Jack taking the law in his own hands, failure to follow up critical witness reports and delays in getting crucial evidence. Strangely we have a new boss in the unit, now a straight talking, drinking large lesbian scotswoman - anyone read Stuart McBride? For all its faults this is a good read and worth a whirl."
4,You do not miss the extra salt - Tastes great,"I ordered one as a trial, liked it and order three more.It's still a little too salty for my taste but a lot better than the regular product.I don't know how it compares in cost to a grocery store because it's hard to find.It's heavy so the shipping is a little steep but it costs the same to ship one or a dozen."
5,The finest 20th century guitar recording I've heard,"Bream is, without question, among the greats of the guitar. This is, in my opinion, a collection that shows why he very well may be the greatest interpreter of 20th century music for the guitar. Bream's natural musicality - his sense of phrasing, vibrato, and color - shine through in all these pieces. To me, the highlights are the Martin pieces, the Walton Bagatelles, the Henze, and the Rawsthorne Elegy. Needless to say, that's most of the recording, and the other pieces are certainly beautifully done as well.This recording is tragically hard to find - if you see it, don't wait, get it!"
4,Exactly what I needed for the car!,My BlackBerry auto charger came as an original equipment accessory in plain packaging with a RIM/BlackBerry label. I noticed that my charger had a different voltage rating than the 12/24V description.But the charger has worked well with my BlackBerry Curve to date and was much less expensive than buying it from an AT&T; retail store.
1,Not as described,"Although this product is of good quality, it is NOT as described and WILL NOT WORK with a BB Bold 9700.This charger is fitted with a mini-usb connector, not a micro-usb connector that is required to fit the Bold 9700.Frustrating to say the least..."
3,Good not great,It was a good movie because it had Hewitt and some humor. However the plot was very predictable and it had too much Friedle and not enough Hewitt.
1,Its amazing the ... that movies are made into...,"The by far worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was far worse then Dungeon's and Dragon's, which is sad. It was the stupidest 1 hour and 30 minutes I have ever sat through. Basicly what the movie is about is Will Friedle thinks he is in love with the ... , Marley Shelton. When he goes over to her house to ""study"" he relizes he has no condum. So for the rest of the film he basicly tries to get one in the stupidest and most unfunny ways. By the end of the movie he finally relizes he should go with, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Sorry if I gave away the ending, but since I thought that the ending was so predictable and dumb it shouldn't even be called an ending.The only enjoyable part of the movie is when the credits come up and you say to your self 'thank god its over'. Do not buy or rent this film, it is a waste of time and money."
3,Extremely fun... even if you are NOT a teenybopper!,"Will Friedle has wondeful potential as both a comedic and serious actor. Though this movie is predictible, corny, and a bit unrealistic, it is carried well by it's writing (I love the crayola crayon speech) and cast of cool side characters (including Jason Marsden and Danny Masterson who are among my long time favorites). Definately good for a laugh, and some sappy romance, if not much more than that."
5,One of the best comedy's ever!!!,"This movie rocks! Love and Marsden are great, as usual. But Will freidle was soooo funny compared to his Boy Meets World stuff. The plot was predictable and reminicent of the 80's teen comedy which is why I like this so much, it was just huge fun. Love and Freidle share some nice moments {when they are on screen together}. Anyone who loved ""Can't Hardly Wait"" should go out and buy this now, highly recommended."
3,VHS is not like the DVD,"I own both the DVD and VHS, the quality of course for the VHS is not the best. Check to make sure which you have when you buy."
3,Little lazy,"A consistently breezy, passably underwhelming early effort for the band's high standards."
2,Rach plays Rach,"Rachmaninoff playing his own stuff sounded appealing,too bad it didn't sound very good. All though technically proficient, his playing doesn't reflect much emotion. Also, as much as modern technology can improve old recordings, the fact remains that he died in 1943 and these recordings all preceded that date by many years. Buy something newer."
2,Band is VERY small - sized for children or very petite women,"The band on this watch is sized for a very small-boned woman or a child. I wear a size 7 1/2"" bracelet (which isn't all that large) and I could not buckle this watch any tighter than the first hole. This meant that the band was constantly coming loose, and I had many close calls where the watch fell off my wrist but I managed to either catch it or find it laying on the floor. Today however, the watch unbuckled and I didn't notice. I lost it.Other than the band size, the watch was fine. It looked pretty enough, was durable and waterproof, and the light feature was very nice, too. I just wish the band had been longer."
2,Casio Luminescent watch,The watch is water resistant. It has a small face. The setting stem is difficult to turn. Maybe better suited for a young child.
3,Watch,I did not feel it last long enough. The battery went dead. I bought a new battery and could not get the small rubber back around the watch. I watch my hands frequently and the water ruined the battery again.
2,Could not agree more with previous review......,"The lack of concern for GLBT couples in higher education research is appalling. This is particularly true for those who do ""research"" on faculty and staff at our major institutions. This book might be relevant for the 1970's: it will not do for today's higher education landscape. I enjoyed the book as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough."
4,Not too bad,"I had a hard time getting into this story, but after I did I really enjoyed the story it told. Not the best J.J. Murray, but certainly not terrible."
4,More like 3.5 stars,"I enjoyed this book, especially the scenes from when the two main characters were kids and had a blossoming love.However, I didn't understand why a beautiful woman like Ebony would save herself for years and years for a dude that she may never see again (female virginity into the late 20s or long term celibacy seems to be a theme in too many of these bw/wm romance novels). Ebony was kind of a bossy, sassy type. Not the type that I'd think would pine away in unending abstinence. If anything, a woman like that would have gone to reclaim her man years ago or never let him get away in the first place.But, the story was still nice and the people were whole and developed. I'd recommend it."
1,Love hate relationship,"Mostly hate, it was not what it was supposed to be, cannot use it as a slave as advertised and cannot find any parts that would make it so. I had wanted the sb-600 and felt like I was getting a bait and switch. And as it was two years ago it sure wasn't $85.00!"
5,Amazing Customer Service,"In my haste to take the first CD out of the packing, I irrepairably cracked it! I initially emailed the British office (which was listed in the book) to see if I could obtain a replacement. Ginny Catmur at that office immediately put me in touch with the American office, which could better address my concerns. Garret Lemoi was the picture perfect example of quality customer service. On the same day I emailed him, he not only responded, but he put a new CD in the mail! My total turnaround was 5 days (from the day I cracked the CD to the day the replacement arrived). This is quality customer service, and I could not be more happy with the response! Thanks so much to Garret and the helpful people at McGraw-Hill for being so helpful! I will absolutely be purchasing products from them in the future!"
1,Lifespan:Developmental Psychology (DANTES) by Jack Rudman,Awful! Don't buy this for a study guide. It was a huge spiral bound book full of possible test questions. It is a waste of money & time. By a college text book or a Psychology review (like Barron's reviews). This was absolutely no help.
4,The Big Everything,"This book is part of the Collectors Press series that include ""The Great American Paperback"" and individual volumes on fantasy, horror and science fiction. Essentially, this is a collection of book covers, movie posters, and other visual representations of crime and mystery media from the 1800's to today. ""The History of Mystery"" is a visual treasure for anyone interested in the genre, and Max Allan Collins' text provides a nice overview of crime and mystery authors and publishing. The only drawback is the same as in all of the Collectors Press books in this series: in many cases the images slightly overlap, with one cutting off a portion of the other. It's not bad enough to ruin the pleasure of the book, but allowing each image to be seen without obstruction would have been a better choice. Highly recommended."
1,NGK tr51 for ls1 gto,"i purchased these thinking it would work on 2004 gto as claimed on NGK website.. however, i suffered from rough idle and hiccups. Installed back the OEM ac delco, and everything became smooth again. Mods are: CAI, Shorties, Catted mids, Magnaflow exhaust system, and tune."
1,Not what I expected,"Definitely not what I expected. I had hoped to hear some words of encouragement and hope. Instead, this CD is merely a ""Relaxation"" tape. My fault..I didn't seee the words ""Subliminal CD"" on the product. It is merely nice music with ocean waves in the background."
2,Background Music vs Voice Over,"If I had been able to listen to this CD first, I would not have purchased it. Much (too much) of the narration is obliterated by the way-too-loud background music (or, in the case of this CD, foreground music). I would have liked to have heard ALL of what the narrator and guest speakers had to say."
2,"FANTASTIC topic, poorly executed","This is a great topic, which makes it all the more disappointing that is was so poorly covered. The dramatization were overdone and got in the way of the science, and the zippo-doo graphics were instantly annoying. And finally, the choice of Danny Glover as a narrator was a big mistake, as he does not have the diction necessary for such a narration intensive program.If this topic interests you, be sure to read""The Seven Daughters of Eve"", by Sykes"
3,gift,I gave this as a gift to a friend and she said it was very hard for her to follow as a beginner. That is had great information but she wished it had shown more from the side view so she could have seen better.
5,Great for kids,This is the first cartoon my grandson started watching he has learned so much from little bear.
4,Overall Good,"Got the book a day earlier than predicted. The book was in the condition that it was listed. However, it does have a musky smell to it. Overall, it was a good transaction."
2,maps lack detail,"First of all the book is not waterproof, second the maps lack detail, third the book is narrow and should not be binded, hard to keep open on the ground. there are about five other maps that are better."
2,Doesn't work for 'mopping',"The earlier reviews say that this brush holds a lot of 'sauce'. However, it is advertised as a mopping brush. In that capacity, it is a major disappointment. Mopping sauces are very thin and are used to keep meats (ribs, brisket, pork shoulder etc.) from drying out in the cooking process. This brush doesn't absorb enough of the mopping sauce to be effective. I don't use the cotton mops because they 'drink' most of the sauce...this one is just the opposite. It doesn't absorb enough 'mop' to baste the food to avoid drying out. It is best used to apply thicker barbeque sauce at the end of a bbq cook. Silicone just doesn't work with a mopping sauce."
3,How to Succeed,"I ordered it for my husband after he heard Mr. Cloud speak on a tv program. The tapes were now of the same interest to him that the sermon was. They were ok, but not what he expected. However, I listened to Mr. Cloud and liked what I heard."
5,One thing you simply must do: read this book!,"I have read a lot of motivational books over the years and expected this one to be full of the same type of advice, warmed-over. I was really surprised by how good the book is. I even gave a copy as a Christmas gift to a friend who has a degree in counseling. And in my Toastmasters club, I gave a speech about this book, and one listener recommended it to her book club, and now they're reading it. The book is written in a way that grabs your attention. It's full of ideas on how to gain control of your life and how to handle relationships in a better way."
4,Frazer and Frevisse are as good as ever,"My reviews on this series are getting repetitious, but here's another good one from Margaret Frazer about Sister Frevisse. A small party with two small boys asks to take sanctuary at the priory after being attacked on the road, but it becomes apparent they have not escaped danger when two more of their party are killed in the days that follow. It's obvious to Frevisse that dangerous politics is involved and she must find the murderer quickly. As always, Frazer is adept at characterization, and the impending death of their beloved prioress from old age adds poignancy to this story. Another excellent addition to the series."
5,The Real Deal,"Margaret Frazer has done it again. In this story of two young boys, half-brothers to the underaged King of England, she blends her profound knowledge of the history and theology of late medieval England with a satisfying plot to keep the more sophisticated reader entranced. There are echoes of 'real' history--the princes in the tower--and lots of details that bring the characters and times to life. Above all, Frevisse is fully developed as a 15th century Benedictine nun--her theology is accurate and if her Latin is a bit shaky, we'd never know.I'm tired of all the superficial 'medieval' mysteries that are just modern stories with a few knights sprinkled around--Frazer knows her stuff. This heroine recites her Hours, but thinks about her God as the granddaughter of Geoffrey Chaucer would have. I have most of the series and will try to find the rest, for sure."
3,"Lots of good ideas for involving children, but...","We used this Haggadah for a few years when our children were preschool-age, with mixed success. I liked the extensive suggestions for involving young children in all aspects of the seder experience. However, we found that the English narration - while lovely - was overly long and didn't hold the kids' attention, especially in the absence of attractive illustrations. It would probably be more suitable for older children. The book reads from left to right and is almost entirely in English, which may be a benefit or a weakness depending on your own personal preference. We ended up supplementing quite a bit from the good ol' Maxwell House version and eventually switched to a somewhat more traditional family-oriented Haggadah."
4,Good Idea,"I found this a neat book and would recommend it for anyone with children. There's a lot of good information you should know BEFORE getting that pet for your child.Well written and easy to read!Shawn Messonnier DVMauthor, 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog, The Allergy Solution for Dogs, and the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats"
4,Brad where are you?,This album is the work of a good song writer. Brad Peterson has a great sound with a rockabilly swing to it. He had one of the best bands to come out of Chicago. I hope he continues to put out new music...
4,My Heart Remembers,I started out with the first Wyoming Wildflower book and had to have all three. This is the first time I have ever read Patricia McLinn books and have really enjoyed them. I will be a fan! These books are love stories but you get an idea of Wyoming and the country side. Just a nice read!
4,Where is the book?,Found the book we want.Put it on our wish list.Cannot see how to purchase the book.Help!
1,Tranceformed in Vain,"This is a horrible attempt at trance. The songs are badly produced and a few even have audable crackling in the background. there is nothing on this CD you cant get 1000 times better off of a Maxi-Single. If you are in dire need of a Madonna dance tribute album, ""Getting into the Grooves: a Tribute to Madonna"" is much better, but still falls far short of the original. To find remixes of any of these songs, simply type the name of the song into amazons search engine and dig up the old singles, or check an auction site for a collection of REAL remixes."
3,cool book,"Posting Customer Reviews is a two-step process. First, complete the form below and click ""Preview your Review."" Then, we will show you how your comments will appear online. When you're ready to submit them, click the ""Submit your Review"" button on the bottom of the page."
5,Billboards Top 40 Hits,I was totally satisfied! I highly recommend this seller. The book was great & it arrived super-fast.
2,Broken on arrival,"There wasn't enough support in the packaging to keep the heavy magnet on the tweeter from snapping the base of the tweeter horn. I didn't care because I only wanted the horn, but if you need the whole tweeter in one piece, have some super glue ready."
2,Cheaply made,"Sad to say! Horn arrived in a plastic bag in a shipping box. The 20oz magnet broke away from the horn itself. I didn't send it back simply because it was more trouble than worth. I glued it back together myself, and tested it in my speaker cabinet. Works OK, but the sound coming out of that cheap plastic, was hard on the ears. All and all! Poorly made, bad packaging, etc. It's true, You get what you pay for. Save you money."
4,Very good for beginner guitarist,"I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said that this dvd was all flash and no substance.This is the best dvd of the classic blues in terms of instruction and songs selection, and the only one worthy of purchase. Stay away from vol 2&3, they're neither worth your time nor your money.For each song, I liked how Dan Warner takes the time to explain how to play each section, it did not feel rushed and was like having a real teacher with me. I enjoyed the final performance with the vocalist.If only the other two volumes were as good as this one.Recommended for beginners who want to learn their first blues songs."
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"This twisted story of violence and drugs in highschool will leave you wanting more! It's a total page turner, laugh out loud in public, counterculture novel. The cover not shown in this add is also quite a conversation starter!"
1,A Promising First Chapter. . . but,"I read this book (almost did not finish it even when I had only 50 pages left) because of some great reviews. It starts out by having a scary setting, but deteriorated, page by page, into silliness and stupidity. I would not recommend wasting time reading this book. Watch TV, take a walk, do anything but read this book. Time waster."
2,"Interesting, but ...","I have heard and read a lot about Laymon, so I decided to give this novel a try. College student Ed (our hero), is dumped by his girlfriend. He gets involved with a new love,and has run ins with night wanderers, cannibals, psychos and... well, it gets weirder (and kinkier) from there.Laymon has a nice flair for the creepy, but some of the elements just don't gel together, and the ending is rushed. We never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care, and the bad guy is just a meaningless plot device with weird kinks.For a better treatment of a similar theme, try the out of print ""The Night People"" by Jack Finney."
1,"Bore, bored, boring....","I don't love Richard Laymon, but his books can usually hold my interest. NOT this one. I finished reading it last night, slipped into a deep bored coma and cannot wake myself up."
2,A worm's-eye view of the Fall of France,"There may be a book here, but what I read isn't it. ""Fighting the Nazis"" is an uncritical, shapeless, flat chronicle of daily life in the Paris HQ of the Deuxieme Bureau. Rather than examine people and situations and provide the reader with an anlysis of events in the light of their outcome, the writer simply reports every word of dialogue, every event-and then goes on to the next one. The book is largely dialogue-oddly enough, for a history. One wonders why, when an announcement about a military breakthrough or a fiasco is given no more emphasis than another announcement about a change in the office's lunch rotation. This book may be worthwhile for someone looking for specific details about specific incidents, but a readable history of France's response to the Nazis must be found elsewhere."
1,Hard to stomach,This CD is the bands worst. The music goes nowhere. And although the band avoids the trappings of a generic industrial sound on this disk I dont know what they were looking for. I could not connect. Buy this last if at all if you are a pigface fan. Go with Below the belt if you want rythmic smooth harmony in your industrial music. Or Feels Like heaven for a fresh aggressive approach.
1,Miss information....,pp. 135-143 errorThe First Council of Nicaea Had nothing to do with scripture in the Bible being removed or kept.
4,Amazon packaging,the book was in a padded bag but unfortunately a corner was bent....the packaging too loose. Maybe a piece of stiff cardboard should be taped around a soft covered book or bubble wrap wrapped around firmly and then put in a padded bag. The book is great.
2,Please,"Robin Gibb is and will continue to be a favorite artist of mine. I think this CD has some interesting material but it is not a great effort in terms of quantity. 3 of the tracks are remakes which cuts the ""new"" material down to 8 tracks. To reward the fan and consumer a CD with 14-16 tracks would be acceptable. I like the direction Robin is taking with this new unique sound. It is not Bee Gee-esque, however, a blend of new and familiar Robin/Bee Gee tunes would make this CD more appetizing. With so many years between solo CD's I feel the effort was not where it should have been, especially if Robin is trying to distance himself from the Bee Gees and create a name for himself. Ceratinly worth a listen at the right price."
3,Light depth,"3 1/2Marking an increased usage of electronic influence, these indie heroes still radiated a relaxed but informed and personalized sound, providing a template often borrowed from since, though hardly passing the microscopic scrutiny much Sea and Cakes provides. They just cannot help but put out relatively exceptable, though far from commendable, filler tracks on their brief discs."
2,It's Oh K,"This compilation is OK. Really nothing to rave about. Pick a few of the tracks and buy them, not the whole CD."
4,In depth reference,"This is a well written book and is a good reference for opal shoppers. However, if trying to determine an opal's worth, the listed formulas are too in depth and cumbersome to use. A person who seriously shops for opals will already have a good idea of value and worth based on their own experiences."
4,"Great information, wonderful photos","This book answers all the who, what, when, where and how's of opals, directly, with fantastic photos to illustrate the information."
5,Great Product,"We are retired and travel overseas a great deal. I tired of carrying round one of the big, wet film cameras, so I bought this one. After more than 1000 pictures, I am sold on it. It is a better camera than I will ever be a photographer...it is very forgiving, and produces bright, colorful images. A real winner."
5,Perfect for all ages!,"I have owned the Panasonic FZ7 for 1 year and was excited to purchase the FZ8. There are so many excellent qualities this camera offers.It is very simple to use for a beginner and offers features to suit a professional. The preview screen is a perfect size with its bright and vivid colors. Settings are easy to change,Including: shutter speed, aperture, time and date, changing the focus point, and many other awesome features! The picture quality is awesome, even with the 12x zoom, my prints do not turn out grainy. Nice light weight and easy grip.Now, the dislikes....only one. This camera does not offer an automatic pop-up flash. I have to remember to open it.I cannot comment on the video of this camera, I use a Sony Handycam for all my video needs.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera and even the FZ7 to anyone interested in starting out with a simple to use camera."
5,Can Anyone Help with Repair Request,I have had this camera for over a year and I love it. But now I need HELP. The LDC screen cracked in my purse and now I don't know what to do. Is the LCD screen replaceable and could I do it myself? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
4,Great for luminous situations poor on dak ones,"Great Camera, easy to use, affordable, many manual features. The only thing is the performance on bad light situations. Cannon basic cameras do better than the lumix in that field. The zoom is the best part. And it does great videos also."
4,Good Overall Camera,"This camera has been used in all sorts of conditions, which is exactly what it's good at. It doesn't have any one particular strength or weakness, it's just decent at everything (sport, night, indoors, etc.). The one problem with the camera is that the pictures at close up are grainy and adjustments don't help much. I've read about many other people with the same issue, but unless you're really trying to get full use out of the 7mp, it shouldn't affect your purchase decision too much. The stabilized zoom is nice and the 12x is great. Buy a couple lenses from raynox and you've got a great camera for a low price."
2,Was very disappointed,"I did so much research before buying this camera. I wanted something small, lightweight, but as good as I hear Sony and Canon are but can be bulkier. It is a very fast camera. The burst mode is all I expected. The 18x was fantastic - I was truly amazed at how close it could get. The disappointed came in when I uploaded the pics to my computer. They were grainy, just awful. Not sharp, crisp. I have used my Canon A95 for several years & have never had to play around with my pics to get the color right or sharp. I could just shoot, upload & enjoy. I spent more time trying to get these to look decent. I just returned this camera. I will be trying the Sony next."
3,BEST THING OUT THERE IN ITS PRICE RANGE,"WELL, I CANT SAY I'M 100% SOLD ON THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE ITS NOT TOTALLY CONSISTENT IN ITS READINGS, BUT CLOSE ENUFF, TILL SOMETHING ELSE COMES ALONG THAT I CAN RAVE ABOUT IN THIS PRICE RANGE;"
3,"Fast delivery, quality product (not 100% what I expected though) AAA",They delivered a high quality product very quickly. The heavy bands weren't as high resistance as I thought they would be. Overall good experience though.
4,Entertaining book,"Some of the pictures are a little creepy but, hey, so is the story itself. Be careful reading this to young children as the concepts are a bit scary."
1,"Slow & meditative, not dynamic!","I found the review of this video to be misleading. I was looking for a yoga video with several sequences of standing poses and balances. I think the only sequence is salute to the sun, and a couple of poses from Warrior posture. Although the video is long, the actual exercises probably only take 30 mins. After each exercise there is a long period of doing nothing - okay maybe it's meditation, but this is not what I call dynamic! You will get a good stretch but if you're looking for something to do daily and are short of time, this is NOT the video for you - or me. I regret buying this tape."
3,good but stingy,This is a rather nice performance of the L'Arlesianne suites. I think it very stingy of DGG that only the first Carmen Suite was included which I hadn't realized when I bought it.
4,One of Wayne's Best....,"I heard a cut from this CD on Pandora, and really listened. I am not a Weather Report guy, and this is recorded in that golden time before all out fusion. The Gil Evans cut ""Barracudas"" is stellar. I wish Mr. Shorter had done more of this ""smoke filled room stuff"" before he plugged in the amps, but this is a winner. It will remind you a little of Miles's ""In a Silent Way"" without as much drug induced (in a good way) dream filtering. This is a great line up with Herbie Hancock, Cecil McBee, and Joe Chambers on skins. Herbie and Wayne truck along nicely and really chase the voodoo down. Grab it, it is not classic but a fine listen...."
5,My Kindergartners love it!,"Great Halloween book with all the traditional characters, but not scary! There's an audio recording by Steven Blane that's not available any more, which is a huge shame."
3,"Some Better, Some Worse","First-rate illustrations are the best feature of this book. The story is entertaining but can be long for 4 and 5 year-olds.The story faults, in that it employs too many characters with no character development, which adds unnecessary confusion and clutter to the story. There is a little boy (Sean) and girl (Meghan), three very old ladies (the children's aunties), and a leprechaun exchanging dialogue in the same 1 or 2 pages, at different points throughout the book.As a parent reading to a child, who wants to present a different voice for each character so that the child can easliy identify who is speaking in the story, there are too many characters talking, but with no distinguishing personalities to make understanding easier.However, the story is somewhat entertaining despite its flaws."
4,Corking melodrama,"The Bottom Line:I would never use the words ""historically-accurate"" to describe this version of the Titanic's sinking, but it's one of those balls-to-the-wall melodramas that makes no secret of its sudsiness while managing to deliver affecting scenes and splendid performances by the leads: by combining the inherent drama of the sinking ship to the melodrama of a fractured family trying to piece itself together, this Titanic really cooks up quite an involving story.3.5/4"
3,I accidentally erased the SPOILER WARNING for my review,"(the one that begins ""One thing that bothers me..."") so regard this as the SW for that review.While I'm here I might as well add that I thought that at the end of the film, the way the ship disappeared into the ocean in one quick gulp was kind of affecting in a strange way. Not realistic, but it suited the mood of the scene."
4,Literary License Keeps Movie Afloat,"We know the ship is going to sink, and we can read the committee reports, history books, and other sources to find out the details of what happened in 1912. This movie presents an innovative plot line that keeps our attention. Importantly, the film also preserves the essential truth of the Titanic disaster: 1,500 people died needlessly on account of arrogance and overconfidence."
5,Best Fictional Titanic Film Ever!!!,"This maybe a historically incorrect movie as far as sets go, but the drama that takes place between Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck, and the other passengers. The story that transpires is a more realistic account of Titanic's passengers and crew and their love and heroism in the face of disaster.......I give this movie ****4 stars"
3,I apologize,"They say it takes an honorable person to admit an error. I'm not necessarily honorable, but I was wrong about some facts in my previous review, and I'd like to correct the situation now. 1) I found the Icons folder I couldn't find earlier. It doesn't install automatically, but if you put the installation CD back in and search, you'll find it. 2) I found the portion of VB6 I couldn't find earlier -- it was just hidden from view. So the product isn't problematic, just the user. I'm still reading the book and using the application, and I am actually, in a truly basic sense, programming. And now, because I have not yet finshed the book, and becuase I don't want to have to apologize again, I resolve to say nothing more."
3,Visual Basic 6 For Dummies,. It's a little out of date and therefore of little use. I probably should have tried to return it.
3,I guess I just expected more music,"The DVD was very good in its presentation of the decline of the CD (record) industry. I would have liked to see more of the ""up and coming"" artists that are not marketable by a major label."
4,A great buy,I really like this tent. I've used many but this is the easiest I've ever put up. Once we put the top on the frame it was very easy to pop the tent open and closed. I found it to be very sturdy. The only problem with it is the cover. Why can't the manufacturers make the cover a bit bigger so the tent goes back in easier. They are just being cheap. All in all it is a good product and better priced than most.
4,Good quality and easy to use.,It only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because straps to hang the windbreaker could be better or it could have reinforced holes inserted along the top edge to enable easier use of canopy ties.
2,Still not complete -,"I would just buy the DVD or VHS tape and make a recording from that, because they have left off Cities and I Zimbra. Frankly, Cities and I Zimbra are some of the best songs from that concert, and leaving them off the re-issue is a shame. Sorry to say, this album does not do the film justice."
4,Sophmore attemp more lackluster then blockbuster,"Straight out, Ma$e's first joint was off da hook. Several smash hit singles sent the album triple platinum. Unfortunately, with the surprising retirement of Bad Boy's pretty boy gone hard, the lack of promotion will keep most from listening to party-rockin' tracks like ""Do It Again"" w/ Puffy and ""Stay Out of My Way"" w/ Total. Although his joint w/ Puffy is tight (tighter then ""Get Ready,"" even), Ma$e doesn't touch on the hotness of ""Feel So Good"" anywhere on this album. Bottom line : If you're a Ma$e fan you can't miss it, and if you're a hip hop fan, then pick it up as a tribute to what seems to be the last from Ma$e... but let's hope he get's back into the game!"
2,Quite A Dissapointment,"After such a great cd in Harlem World which featured some of the best crossover material that you will ever hear M-A dollar sign-E has delivered one of the worst cd's for such a talented rapper as most of the people who are reading this know that ma$e is making a comeback and is featured on one of Nelly's new double cd's that are coming out in august 04 and Ma$e has a new song called ""Welcome Back"" with the same sample as the onyx hit ""Slam Harder"" look towards thoose tracks for future mase material or go back and listen to the crossover smash Harlem World and skip this compact disc for mostly terrible production. I hope that Mase comes back with some serious fire and i wonder if he will be a gospel rapper?Guests:Blackstreet,P.Diddy and Harlem WorldFavorite Track: Make Me Cry5.5 of 10 lyrics 3.5 of 10 beats"
3,It wasn't all that,"I really enjoyed his first album ""Harlem World"" but in this second album ""Double Up"" it is very obvious that he didn't put as much time and effort as he did with his first!!!!"
1,Don't Buy,Anyone who buys it is wasting there money this CD is no good seriously I am glad this is his last CD Puff is bad. even more what is the point of this guys. DEATHROW FOR-LIFE
2,Mase should have named it Double Down.,"What was mase thinking here when he decided to quit. I don't hate him for turning to god because that is good thing str8 up, but with sounds as weak as this you need to be behind the album. I know this will still sell because of who he is and his fans and image but one listen and you'll see it can't compare to the first. Lyrics wise it's whole lot better and he flows a lot more stronger and faster on this cd. But the production on some of these songs is just wack and weak. I was really feeling his first one, but this, well, theres at least 4 I like. the rest i'll leave up to you the listeners to decide but trust me, Double up definetly isn't double the beats or lyrics cause it's just weak. I'm not hating on mase juts saying what I think. I think puffs cd will be way better. I heard the first cut P.D. 2000 and that will start the bad boy hits all over again.Buy at your own risk. I give mase the two stars for the good songs and better lyrics."
2,TERRIBLE ALBUM - A SHAME TO BAD BOY,I think the beats on this album were weak. The beats are the downfall of this album. What's going on with the once good Bad Boy beats? This is a terrible album
3,not nearly as good as old cd,I was kind of disapointed because I expected more good songs. He had alot of good songs on his first album and only about two on this album. I also think he was better off quitting because most rappers are alot better then him.
3,"It' Aiight, but not all that.","I am a MA$E fan, don't get me wrong, but the album continues to prove that Bad Boy CEO Shawn Puffy Combs is losing touch with the ever-changing hip-hop crowd. MA$E still spits competitive lyrics, but the idea of him changing what Puff Daddy brilliantly did on Harlem World,(sample-mania and go commercial as hell) is going to turn away his major fan base(pretty boys and ladies). He came correct on a couple of tracks, such as Same NiXXas and of course Get Ready, but it will never be another Harlem World. It doesn't have many collaborations with other artists, which is pretty much a must for a successful album nowadays. That would lead one to believe that this was an unfinished project, considering MA$E's decision to go gospel earlier this year. Overall Grade: Weak; Sophomore Slumper"
2,NOT THE FULL SONG!,"SongXpress ""Austin Blues Vol 1"":One big disappointment with this series (SongXpress) is you are NOT taught the whole song! The solos are missing altogether! The main song parts are demonstrated very well, but they should specify somewhere in the listing that they do not teach you the whole song with solos!I had also purchased one of the SongXpress Singles ""Crossroads"" and the two main solos are not shown at all! When you think of ""Crossroads""(Cream, Clapton) the majority of the song is soloing, and yet no solo is demonstated!Big Disappointment!"
2,Overly familiar territory,"I won't repeat all the opinions expressed in the other two ""negative"" reviews of this recording but I think the only thing original in The Way Up is that the songs are long enough to somewhat hide the fact they've all been done by Metheny before. It's just not interesting and seems a waste of much talent."
1,It is Like Journey!,"This sounds like what the band ""Journey"" would do if they had an all instrumental album."
5,The Neverending Story Of Musicianship At Its Finest,"Here we go again. Another incredible chapter in the continuing musical saga bestowed upon us by the Pat Metheny Group.An incredible poignant musical journey. Remarkable musicianship. With each listening to this opus, new discoveries abound."
5,Maximal musical historisism is what you get...,"if you join PMG The Way Up. It is the last 400 years of music history incorporated into multi-layers of sound, individual world class performances (I heard them in Oslo 15. May, amazing!!) and melodic simplicity as the ""red thread"" through the album. Buy it!"
5,Rich,"I had to listen to this disc a few times before I 'got it'. The way Metheny/Mays allow the themes to creep through all the different changes is what stitches the whole thing together for me. Sure, they've been heard before, but not at this level of complexity. To hear musicians play/compose at this level is an absolute dream. What a celebration of humanity. I can't wait to hear this live."
1,disappointed,"I just don't get how there can be so much gushing admiration for a kaleidoscope of music that is tedious listening. Yes, I've been a PMG fan right from the self-titled debut album in the late 70's, right through Offramp, Travels, First Circle, Talking, We Live Here, and Imaginary Day. Five stars to all these titles. But with Speaking of Now and The Way Up, I question what is really being said in the music. Where are the beautiful melodies? Where is the barely contained tension of Are You Going With Me? The Way Up is a confused sequence of time and key changes that do not contribute to a cohesive message. Listening to this album is like listening to a teenage kid who talks all of the time and doesn't speak in complete sentences. What are you trying to say?Anyway, Pat if you're reading this, please know that your music has been a cornerstone of my musical experience since the 70's. I wish you well, and I hope you will once again connect with the music in your heart.Cheers."
4,A BOON FOR MATURE SKIN,"Nowadays, most of us are very familiar with how beneficial Vitamin C is for our skin - it can tone, brighten, firm, leaving skin smoother and more youthful in appearance. EmerginC Skincare, a respected name in Vitamin C technology, offers Replenogen-A, a firming enhancer especially formulated for mature skin.Replenogen-A contains plant based micro-collagen, red algae, soy, clover, and other ingredients effective in giving skin a visible lift while at the same time hydrating mature skin, which can tend to dryness.After cleansing apply to skin.

3,Find Release or Be Lost... In Heather's Mind...,"Lonely or broken-up from your man, then this is the album for you. Song after song is full of all the great ""you-done-me-wrong"" anthems that will surely make you get over your loved one quickly, with such songs as ""Wait a Minute"", ""Losing You"", and ""The Letter"". But yet, if you can't get over him that fast, there are a few tracks you can wallow in like ""I Didn't Mean To"" and ""What's Not Being Said"". And just when you thought Heather was going to leave you in a state of man hate/love limbo, she throws in ""How Many Ways"", ""Rain"", ""Back When It Was"" (which is a great groove, yet corny), and ""Change"" to try to take you away from where the last song left you. So, shed the baggage and thank Heather Headley for the release."
2,not what i expected,I thought this was whole grain kasha. it was the coarse granules and not what i thought i was ordering.it should be more clearly labeled as to the exact product.i wanted the whole kasha grain.very misleading.
2,Cooked into a Paste,"My wife is from Kiev and I always look for food that she likes from back home. It seems that the buckwheat at the local food markets is ""green"" and not the same as it is in the Ukraine. So when we saw this product on line and that it was roasted, she was very happy so I purchased six boxes. However, when she cooked it the first time, it turned into a paste and was nothing like the image on the box. We have now given away this product to the local homeless center in the luck that someone else may like it, we didn't."
3,window lift motor,this part is not a direct fit . the wiring harness is not the same as what my 2004 dodge 1500 has on it.
3,Hero's character lacking,"This is the first book I've read of Ms. Willman's and was not very impressed. I found the part of the hero, Alistair, lacking. The piece appeared very one sided with very little insight into his thoughts and character. If this is an example of her writing, I'm surprised she is an award winner. She does not seem to be in the same sphere as a majority of top novelists in this genre. The basis of the story is very intriguing. But I felt more detail into the main characters would've enhanced the piece tremendously. One major character in the end, was almost completely overlooked in the entire piece. A good mystery, even romantic in nature, should lead the reader to the ending or at the very least speculation. That is not the case in this story making me feel as if the story was rushed to publishing and incomplete. Whether this is a result of the publisher or the author is mote do to the end result, a less then satisfying novel."
2,Not very good,"I had such high hopes for this book, since I loved MW's Pieces of Sky, but I just didn't enjoy it. The character development was lacking. Alistair was bland, and the plot was slow. Even the love scenes were lukewarm."
1,"Please, think about what you're doing.","In my opinion, this is not a good purchase. It's an example of the money making machine in action. No, I'm not one of those Doors ""purists"" who think that without Morrison everything is useless, I feel that the music performed on this DVD is of poor quality. If you like STP and Creed and shtuff, than you might like this. If you like the Doors, the real Doors, then buy a CD and listen to them the way they really are. If you like all star karaoke, go to a Hollywood bar. It'd be cheaper."
5,The card work perfectly,I put the card in the camera and it worked perfectly. It was as simple as that. The 2GB is nice too.
3,Not the fastest option for digital camaras,"If you are buying a memory card for a digital camera, the xD Card type H is a much faster option. Faster to write to the card after taking a picture and faster to download onto your computer. I just bought the Olympus sp-550uz along with the xD card type M that was recommended in the ""people who bought that also bought this"" section of the description. Big mistake. The 1GB H xD is 3 times as fast."
5,Great card for the price Olymp 2 GB XD card,Card worked flawlessly in my OLympus E-volt 500 digital SLR. Holds 1000 pictures at a time at HQ resolution.
3,Satisfied,"I didn't get the results as I was hoping for, but still felt as if the product was effective... I had acne prone skin and my skin cleared up quite a bit; overall, I felt great. I did the stronger cleanse exactly as directed on the packaging and everything went well except for when I weaned myself off of the product; I had terrible and uncomfortable stomach cramps for 2-3 days which I believe was a result of the senna. Upon further research on the internet, I found out that it is not recommended that anyone take a product containing senna for any longer than 7 days -- I took this for about 14 days. I'm not sure if the cramps had anything to do with the senna but I believe it's a word of caution worth mentioning."
3,Internal Cleansing,"When I first receive the item. i was so excited to try it. When I first try it It did'nt effect me on the second day I started to see that it was working but, I could'nt handle it because it had a side effect which was making my heart beat go fast and I could'nt sleep so I end up lowering the dosage of pill to see if that would work and it did but, then I stop because I had to take other pills. So I still have it but, I'm have to keep on taking it with low dosage. It seems that it works but, taking to much of it does'nt agree with me. So I do'nt know If I should keep taking the pills. It seems like a good product but, you have to know if you are allergic to it. They require to take alot dosage. I suggest to read the inside of the label before buying it. Do your research and make sure it agree with you. I still think it will work but, not with me."
1,no one said there were subtitles,"I HATE SUBTITLES,if i wanted to read,i would get a book,so this is a warning for those who are thinkn bout getn this,THERE ARE SUBTITLES!!"
5,Lyrical Reggaeton,"This collaborative effort is hard driving,foot thumping dance oriented music for those of you who like this genre of reggaeton. My favorite song however is a mix of heavy soca and reggaeton named No Te Veo. This song filled the spanish music airwaves this summer. Great dancing tune as well as listening.The rest of the music is equally good. Reggaeton seems to be taking over entirely in Latin America.If you like other groups such as Calle 13 and Daddy Yankee etc., this will be a great addition. Some od the lyrics may be a bit shallow; but you don't listen to reggaeton solely for the lyrics. It's going to want to make you get up and dance."
2,Poster,"The poster was mailed in a cardboard prism and arrived bent, with creases all over. I tried to iron it out, but the marks left by the poster creases are still very visible."
4,Good for beginners..,"I just began learning how to program in C++ and I actually enjoyed this book a lot.First of all, it's littered with various stories and jokes that sort of reward you for reading. The general outline is; you debug a program, and then you read a short funny story. It does that mostly throughout the book, until you get to the final chapters.The rest of the book is full of C/C++ source code that has a bug in it, and you have to figure out what they are. Some of the programs were actually easy to debug, but as a beginner, I found them to be both entertaining and helpful. I now know what kind of things to avoid, and I know how to problem solve a lot better now. This book is helping me gain experience without actually writing out all of these programs.I wouldn't use this book as a substitute for an actual education, and I wouldn't use this book as my one and only source of experience. It should be used simply as a supplement.Very funny and overall a very rewarding experience."
5,SIMPLY GREAT!!!,"This album really excites me for this include one of my favorites ""Someone to Watch Over Me"". Kenny really did a good job here, very sexy and smooth. His new version of ""Haven't We Met"" is awesome. So glad that he finally did an album like this, which took me 5 yrs. of waiting for this to be released here in the Philippines. Lucky me! I was able to get a copy. How I wish he did these 2 songs when he was here for a concert."
4,First Grandchild,"I bought this for my first grandchild, a boy, due in April. It is so soft and sweet. I'm sure in a year or so, he will love it."
2,a blank page journal with a chintz china patterned cover,If you're looking for an attractive ring- binder notebook for a diary or journal this would be charming. It has lined pages and a hard cover with a chintz china pattern on it's edge.
2,A bit of weak tea,"I have to say the album was a disappointment. There is a bit of musicianship here, but the voice is awkward and the songwriting thin. Maybe he captivates his family and friends, but Mr. Martin takes his place generally among the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who produce records every year that have nothing really to say."
3,Problem with the title,"You should know that I did not read this book.I have a problem with the title. A soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine, does not WIN a medal.It is earned. And, sad to say in the case of the MoH, very often at the cost of one's life."
5,In my opinion,Product was as described and very useful to a technically challenged person on Automotive Fuel Injection systems.
4,A well written and informative book.,This book covers both electronic and manual fuel injection. It gives a general explanation of how each type works with a more detailed description of each type later in the book. There are trouble-shooting guides and testing techniques are included. My only two criticisms of this book are: The trouble-shooting guides are not as comprehensive as they could be. The chapter on tuning basically tells you not to bother and includes very few useful tips. Unless you are interested in the performance tuning of your fuel injection system this is an excellent book and well worth owning.
2,"OK but not as complete as Watson's ""How to Tune and Modify B","This book was not as complete as the previous review had rendered. The ""how to Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection"" book authored by Ben Watson was more complete and addressed troubleshooting guides. This book required you to have a set of OEM manuals for the proper spec's. The book was a good overview on operation and theoreticals on the systems but didn't allow enough info for the tuner and troubleshooter, especially for the CIS systems."
4,Want to know how it all fits together?,"Ok, so you know a great deal about fuel injection. You understand what an Injector is, you know about O2 sensors, you know the difference between MAP and MAF sensors. But you just can't quite understand how each of these components interacts with a Fuel Injection system. Then buy this book. It does a good job of explaining how each component works, and what it's role is in the system. Even if your car doesn't use a BOSCH system, the concepts are still the same. Once you understand the basics, the rest falls nicely into place."
2,Not So Good,"I would stay away from this book. This book is very inaccurate, and it is poorly written. ""Everybody knows that Lisa Lopes moved to Atlanta by herself, and that she met T-boz through Rico Wade not some nightclub. If you want to know the real story about Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes get the VH1 Behind The Music ""TLC"" and the Left Eye Tribute in S2S magazine."
3,Supernova,"This book was good. However as some one mentioned the author did make some mistakes. She left out two of Lisa's guest appearances in the back of the book. 1997 Nothing to Lose Soundtrack - ""Not Tonight(remix)""- Angie Martinez, Lil' Kim, Da Brat, Left Eye and Missy Elliot. I don't know how you miss that record since it was such a hit. Not only that she missed another guest song from 1997 off of Will Smith's cd ""Big Willie Style"". The fifteenth song was titled ""Big Willie Style"" and it featured Left Eye. I was very surprised that the author missed these important songs. I mean they were major songs that Left Eye did , I don't know how she missed them while doing her research which leaves me to believe that she is not a Hip-Hop & R+B fan, cuz I'm sure a lot of people know about these songs."
1,flower,"Purchased 2 of these and it was not what it claimed to be! both tore within a few weeks, stuffing is now coming out---maybe for a very small dog--but NOT for anything over 40 lbs! not worth it --"
3,Durable but not plush,"As other reviews have written, this bed is NOT plush. It arrives vacuum packed and never seems to get nice an fluffy. The cover could hold three or four times the amount of cushioning that is provided. This is not a good bed for older arthritic dogs. It is fine for younger dogs, but you will not be spoiling them with this one. The plaid top is a nice soft poly flannel. The base and sides are a durable nylon - even though my thee mini dachshund puppies chewed right through it in a couple of hours. The Velcro closure is also easier than the zipper closures on most other beds and holds up to washing and puppy teeth better."
1,Try this cover instead,"Noticed that there are comments about the cover falling apart. I have gone through many, many dog beds for one reason or another. I finally found an awesome, inexpensive dog cover. I took the internal stuffing from the ripped/destroyed ones and put it into this cover. They have lasted longer than any others. Because it is a cover with a zipper, you can take out the stuffing and wash the cover easily. The denim is very durable. Lining36""X29"" Medium Large Water resist Zipper internal pet bed cover with Taffeta fabric for dog and catand CoverMedium to Large 36""X29"" Durable Tough Jean Pet Bed Cover for Dog & Cat"
3,All right for $10,"It's a very basic watch. It looks pretty good, actually, but I was annoyed by how the band that folds over always came loose and I would have to reinsert it. The watch buckle (?) stays on securely, but the strap would fall out of the band.It also bugged me that the second hand ticks pretty loudly, which is bothersome because I got this for test-taking. With enough white-noise, you shouldn't notice the ticking but it just bothered me and I ended up ordering a different watch for more money."
3,"Eh, not that great, silver insert unappealing",Got this watch for my girlfriend because she liked my Casio so much and keep taking it. Turns out I should have just got another mens watch for her... The silver insert is quite ugly and takes away from the classic appeal of the watch.
1,Something Ho Hum,"Overall, a disappointing read. If you're looking for something new on the subject of marriage--or Alzheimers--look elsewhere. This book is all surface gloss and no substance; you come away from this book with the impression that Ms. Beesley can't, or won't, speak to the heart of any issue deeply, including what it means to slowly lose your mother. There's really only one well-defined character in this book--Ms. Beesley--the rest are ghosts or cartoons. Feminists and philosophers, beware."
2,Zildjian magazine ad,"I have played Zildjians all my life but this author seems to be on the Zildjian company payroll. Some good pictures but the rest is a Zildjian 'brain wash'. The Zildjian history is confusing and the overall book is poorly layed-out. You have to skip over many pages of poor quality pictures to continue to read again. You know like magazines articles where they say 'contined on pp. xxx', that kind of stuff. Book reads like a Zildjian magazine ad. Buy 'The Cymbal Book' instead."
4,Definitely different,"I picked this Cd up first from my local lending library, not really knowing what to expect - the liner notes had fascinated me, as had the references to Steve Reich in one or two of the song titles, so I thought it was either going to be, like the best of Reich's pieces, full of ecstatic melodies and swing, or, like Reich's worst, disjointed and flat. After listening, both. The best tracks, like ""Lonely Lounge Piano Player.."" and ""Galileo"" use unconventional rhythms and timbres thrown together almost haphazardly to create lush and dubby electro-acoustic songs. Imagine Tortoise playing with chance procedures, or Reich playing with Do Make Say Think, maybe! The worst are quaint and over worked doodles, but are thankfully rare. Adam Pierce hasn't really been able to recapture this form, which is a great shame."
3,kind of dull,I really don't have much to say on this. It lacks a plot. Rather boring. Not up to snuff for a Mercer Mayer book.
2,How did this guy find a publisher???,"This book reads like an abridged version of Margaret George's ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra"" which was published in 1998. The two books are so similar that I figure there must be a real wealth of detailed historical information on Cleopatra's reign; no publisher could have taken a chance with something that appears to be plagarized. Don't bother with it - get George's book and enjoy the rich history and character development."
1,Too biased against men,"Although I found the descriptive prose to be very entertaining and informative for the settings and places, the same was not true for the characters and action. All men in this book are portrayed as egomaniacal tyrants, drunken fools, silly sycophants or chronic complainers. The women, on the other hand, are portrayed as clear-thinking, purposeful and virtuous victims of the men's excessively flawed personalities. I found it hard to believe that an army would follow any of these men despite documented history to the contrary. Additionally, I found descriptions of battles and major military engagements to be virtually non-existent. Perhaps the author considered actual events to be unimportant when compared to the need for further analysis of poor little Cleopatra's thoughts on her trials and tribulations."
5,An outstanding film,"As long-time fan of the super-hero genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. The treatment of classic Marvel heroes is well done. In traditional Marvel style, the DVD addresses the emotions and feeling of Captain America who is agruably the central figure of the story. That is what I expect from Marvel. Perhaps the story line borrows a little from the premiere of Cartoon Network's adaptation of the Justice League (i.e. heroes uniting against an alien menace). And maybe an origin story isn't truly necessary. But I still have to give this DVD the highest ratings"
1,How can I sue Stan Lee to get my $10.00 back?,"This was awful from the very beginning to the very end. Marvel proved that they not only make terrible feature films but they can't even make a decent cartoon movie.It was dreadful from the very beginning to the very end: poorly drawn, no plot, no character development and mediocre villians.Why did Bruce Banner look like a reject from Eon Flux, why was Thor drinking beer the whole time and why was he hanging out with a group of environmentalists when he is a norse God? If the villians were an advanced race of super-alliens, why were they defeated in 4 minutes? Why were Iron Man and Giant Man made to be so unlikeable?Don't buy it, don't rent it; if I were you I would forget that it was ever made.That's what I am going to try to do."
4,Half Ultimate...,The second part is coming out in july which will feature Black Panther. Bit of a PG rating. little more than the usual saturday morning stuff. Animation not choppy like I expected. What are the chances of seeing She Hulk? I luv chicks with green eyes. I want Shulkie. I luv Shulkie.
2,Waste.,"Usually animated comic movies are decent. Or so I thought probably because I've seen the amazing Batman movies but this just pathetic. Boring, doesn't follow the comic at all or barely. Two stars because they focus on Cap who is my favorite marvel character."
2,A WORK IN PROGRESS FOR MARVEL ANIMATION...,"For those who are watching a marvel animation for the first time, or grew up watching Spiderman & X-men (not ""Evolution"") animated series, this is an UPGRADE to the engine that drives the action, fluidity, and animation of the movie. It's a breathe of fresh air. But for those who have seen Justice League Animation, The Batman, & other present DC Comics adapted / WB animated series, this movie IS NOWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY THAT YOU CAN EXPECT - both in animation, and storytelling. And for those who have read the Comics, based on this movie, the FIRST FIVE MINUTES will bring to (disappointing) tears. Having said that, I am currently collecting MORE JLU & THE BATMAN animated series, to quench my close-to-anime thirst, and fill the void, WHICH I ASSUMED THIS MOVIE would provide. Look on the bright side, at least it's not cartoon 1969 (remember those kids?)."
5,Worth It,I purchased the Ultimate Avengers - The Movie for my husband as a gift. He was so thrilled and played it over and over again. It was really well done and very enjoyable. I had to go out and but vol. 2. I was well worth the price.
3,It's ok - worth the 2 min. Hulk vs Thor battle,"Yeah, it was ok.Why they to make Nick Fury a bald black guy I don't know. Strange. Also, Thor is an enviromentalist/Animal Rights Activist. Why be so friggin' PC??Thor and Hulk battle was very good. I think had they stayed with the original plots from Lee/Kirby it would have been much better.I would like to see a movie based on the Nick Fury vs. SHIELD limited series."
2,Mediocre animation mars an otherwise entertaining movie.,"I guess I've become spoiled by Warner Animation's DC Comics adaptations that I expected Marvel's first animated movie to be of the same quality. Boy was I wrong! The animation is sub-par at best. Heck, most of Marvel's Saturday morning fare in the last 12 years was better animated than this movie. Story wise the movie isn't bad with the formation of the Avengers ala Ultimate Marvel Comics style. I just wish they had used better animators and made a truley good animated movie instead of this so-so movie. I, for one, am not holding out any hope for either the upcoming sequel nor for the Iron Man or Doctor Strange animated films in the future. Rent ""Ultmate Avengers"" before you decide to buy it, because I wish I had."
1,Not Dog Safe,"This product is not the least dog safe in design. Sure my hound loves fetching the flashing ball however the plastic nodules are very hard and chip in a matter of moments if chewed leaving very sharp edges that scratch and/or lacerate the inside of your dog's mouth.There are other balls on the market that illuminate or flash and don't make your dog's mouth and gums bleed so I strongly recommend purchasing another product without the unsafe nodules, which is what I am now having to do. Total waste of money. This ball goes straight into the garbage, before we need a vet."
4,Great sound!,"I received this as a gift - and I cant get enough of it! Awesome speakers for such a little thing - fills my whole kitchen up with sound!! Like other people have said, the radio doesn't work very well. Very easy to install and it is compatible with my ""ancient/massive"" ipod (as well as smaller ones). For some reason, it randomly sets off an alarm every couple days and it sometimes makes my ipod freeze up (which if you just hold the center and menu button down at the same time to reset it, it fixes itself)."
4,Great VCR/DVD player,"I'm very happy with this player. We use it all day long. I bought it for my 3 year old daughter's room. Her tv is not hooked up to cable. We just use it for her to watch her videos and DVDs. She can watch Sesame Street tapes all day and we keep them playing. This machine is up to the task. Obviously, we haven't recorded on it, but the picture plays very clearly and the sound is great. Remote is easy to use as well. Wonderful seller. Fast shipping. Would recommend."
1,'a beat up catfish',"i gotta give props to the girl 'thayes' who a few reviews down compared lil jon to a beat up catfish. that was the best laugh i've had all week.anyway, this isnt music. what it is is a disgrace. i sure hope that when people see and hear this stuff they don't think lil jon is representative of all black men, cuz that clown is not doin us any favors. this music is aggressively horrible and lil jon strikes me as a filthy lout.hope this helps."
1,Crunk Juice is not rap,"This is Labeled under rap and Lil Jon does not rap. Party and Club music is yes he should be a DJ instead because he is not a rapper this is a good album for Clubs, Hype, and Party. This is basically the Death Metal, Mosh Metal of Rap Music but this isnt rap. This is great for those Stupid and dumb B*tches who claim to listen to rap but dont know true rappers and only listen to beats and nothing about lyrics."
3,"""Lovers and Friends""","Buy this CD for the Crunk music but more for ""Lovers and Friends"" with Ludacris and Usher. That's really the only reason why I bought it. There are some good songs on it though, ""What They Gonna Do"" is hot and there's also a song with the Neptunes I think is cool because it's different. They even put a go-go song on it which is a big deal if you're from the DC area."
2,B*tch! Sh*t! Hey! What!?,"I gotta give Lil' Jon props for producing some major hits this year! Starting off with ""Get Low"" and it's remix, Culo, Saltshaker, Neva Eva, No Problem, , Freek-A-Leek, My Goodies, Yeah!, What You Gon' Do and finally Lovers & Friends. It's great music for the club and to listen to once in a while on the radio..., but a whole cd is simply too much to handle (sorry!?). One can tell that this CD is a little more mainstream than ""Kings Of Crunk"", since Lil' Jon included some radio friendly tracks, such as ""Lovers and Friends"", ""In Da Club"" and ""Stick That Thang Out"", but I just can listen to this CD the whole way thru. All you hear is *%&$!?. With the exception of Lil' Scrappy's, Ludacris's and Ice Cube's verse the rappin' on this CD is very, very poor, but people buy this CD for ""Lovers and Friends"" (Which in my opinion would rather fit on Usher's ""Confessions"" CD) and the crazy beats. Get Crunk, if you feel like it."
1,don't even get me started,"This is the most incoherent buncha of no talent garbage i've heard. These guys have no talent, especially lil Jon. He's the ultimate example of an idiot(literally) that somehow becomes rich. It's sad taht good bands don't sell like this album does."
1,Do you call this rap? Do you even call this music?,"How can people listen to this bul****, these bit*** are a joke. They can't rap, they can't sing, they just scream. If if you call that a music or you like this than i suggest you go to your doctor.OUTLAW"
3,I jus cain't get crunk wit this album!,"Crunk Juice ain't a bad album, really it ain't. The only problem I got wit this album is that it really don't get people as crunk as Kings of Crunk did. Sure there's some good songs on CJ, but only a few are considered crunk songs. But still an album worth buying."
2,How the hell is the best song a slow jam!!!!!!!!!!!,WHHHHHAAAAATTTTT HEY......and after that ur wondering whats going on. It starts strong but its like what happen to that incredible experince that you are suppose to have thats jon says on the first track after you have gone through the cd. there is only one complete song thats good from beggining to end and yes its a slow jam. I honestly know alot of people with this cd and all the play is this one song. Kings of Krunk was a Krunk cd but Krunk juice.........I dont wanna type no mo.
2,"Naaa,not hip-hop,this is crunk","Lil Jon is a great esponent of crunk music.Everubody know.So we must listen his music for what it is.Yo,I remember that this is NOT rap;rap is Wu-Tang Clan,Redman,Kanye West,Nas...this is crunk,a music style full of screws,girls,cadillacs and created for clubs. In discos you will listen Luda and Jon,fo'sure.""Crunk Juice"" it's probably trash for who thought in a great double H album.Homies,this is Lil Jon's sound.Stop.If you like club-bangers,well,this is your cd:Little drops hits like ""Roll Call"" ft.Ice Cube and his EastSide Boys.ADVERTISEMENT:not for hip-hop lovers,or crunk estimateurs.2,5"
2,Lil Jon: Crunk Juice,"I just don't see why so many people like this music. Oh, my bad, I should even call this music so I'll just call it Lil Jon music. Lil Jon's music a just a bunch of crap but some of his songs are good for clubs and such. He has banging beats but they all sound the same, he recycles to much to be honest. The only song I really like off this album is ""Grand Finale."" Nas and Ice Cube tear it up on that track no question. All Lil Jon says is ""YEAH"" and ""OK"" which gets really annoying really fast. All Lil Jon does is yell out cuss words and constantly degrades women. I could do this music and sell records if I wanted to. It just goes to show how easy it is to make it big and make money these days. I'm not even going to go any further with this review because it's a waste of my time. I wouldn't suggest this album to anyone unless you like crap rap."
3,Hes o.k.,This guy is pretty tight but every song is pretty much the same and every time a song starts up he acts like we forgot who he was buy saying his name and the eastside boys but still a hot alblum
4,I like I really like it,"Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz are on the verge of Superstardom with Crunk Juice. Although dem boys can't rap they are very good hype men and in all honesty it seems like now a days that's all you need to be. The guest spots on Crunk Juice are what make the CD a winner. Lil Jon enlisted Ludacris, R. Kelly, Usher, T.I.,Ice Cube, Nas and others for this party album. Stand out tracks includle Lovers & Friends, One Night Stand, Grand Finale, Aww Skeet Skeet, Lean Back rmx and more. My only compliant with the CD is that Jon didn't include the song with Jamie Foxx."
1,Like burning in hell...,"""OMGZZ UR A HATER. THIS IS CRUNK!!""The excuse that this is ""crunk"" doesn't cut it anymore. This is bottom of the barrel, we scraped it, nothing left, all out, pandering junk. Designed to sell a Red Bull knock-off.I don't care about any excuse people will give to justify this CD. This a SHAME to any rap/hip-hop from the South. I mean... really...I'll fully admit I'm not completely up on the ""Dirty"" South, but I KNOW the South, hell, I know Lil' Jon can even do better than this. Remember ""Weak Azz B*tch"" from 3-6? THIS IS THE FIRST MINUTE AND A HALF OF THAT SONG DRAGGED OUT TO ALBUM LENGTH. Of course, Triple Six is like, Wu-Tang or the Juice Crew compared to Lil' Jon at this point.If you buy this, you have absolutely zero taste in music. The mass market has you by the balls. I never thought I'd agree with Nancy Reagan when she said ""Just say no"".It's your duty as a human to ignore this plague on music."
1,this album sucks,IT has to many curse words and to much screamin dont buy the edited verzoin buy the unedited
3,LIL JON........ KINDA....... SOLD OUT LIKE...........!!!!!!!,THIS ALBUM AINT CRUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITS GOT SOME GOOD TRACKS ON IT..... BUT I AINT CRUNK.... ENOUGH......AND HE'S GOT TO MANY SKITSLOVERZ AND FRIENDZ... AND IN DA CLUB... R BOTH GOOD SONGZ... BUT THERE AINT.... CRUNK...........LIL JON............. MESSED IT UP....
1,All Lil Jon Fans Are Dumb As Hell!!!,"I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following.NWA - Straight Outta ComptonIce Cube - Amerikka's Most WantedDr Dre - The ChronicSnoop Doggy Dogg - DoggystyleNas - IllmaticTha Dogg Pound - Dogg FoodTupac - Me Against The WorldTupac - All Eyez On meTupac - Greatest Hits50 Cent - Power Of The DollarBiggie - Life After DeathYou get the picture."
5,OOOOOOOOOHKAAAYYYY!!!,"This album is by far lil Jons best yet. Its energetic and never stops. Guest appearances really make this worth listening to, especially hearing SNoop Dogg gettin in on the CRUNK vibe. Truly a new standard for crunk music! GET IT! Its NOT disappointing!"
5,Lil Jon is the KING of CRUNK,"I have been a lil jon fan since i heard his 'put yo hood up' album and he outdone himself when he came out with 'kings of crunk' and now he's really crunkin' with his latest album 'crunk juice' i know that to some of you he seems annoying with his repetitive screaming and whatnot but even with that said i still think his albums kick butt simply because of the crunkin' beats. i listen to lil jon only because i enjoy his beats and they sound superb in my stereo, and not because of his voice of songs. lol but hey everyone has their likes and dislikes of an artist. with that said i still think lil jon is the king of crunk. keep it real now. peace."
4,Hubbard explains Scientology philosophical principles,"L. Ron Hubbard has been called a malicious cult leader by some and a benevolent religious leader by others. ""Fundamentals of Thought"" clearly lays out the philosophical foundations of the religion he founded known as Scientology. I consider Hubbard's ""Fundamentals of Thought"" a perfect showcase to illustrate Scientology principles and beliefs. You may or may not agree with Hubbard but his philosophy is clearly laid out here."
2,butter keeper,It appears that the two pieces to this item do not match in shades of white. I had hoped to find more attractive butter keepers.
3,IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS BOOKS BY LILIAN,THE BOOK WAS GOOD BUT DID NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE OF A REGULAR BOOK BY LILIAN JACKSON BRAUN.BILL
1,Complete lack of editing,"I love this genre of fiction (although the distance between fiction and current reality in this country is becoming increasingly narrowed) but this book is just awful. Stereotyped characters, an unrealistic disaster scenario, an adolescent focus on weaponry and, what appears to be very poor, if any, editing based on the extensive misspellings and misused words that spellcheck can't be expected to correct. I simply had to quit reading after the second use of ""wondering"" instead of wandering on the same page. Stilted and completely unnatural dialog with every character utilizing other characters' proper names in every sentence. This just isn't how people talk to each other. This author would be well served to try to ""hear"" the dialog he is creating. Sorry, but I just couldn't finish this one and I have waded through some pretty bad books in the past."
2,I was hoping for better....,"This book just failed to grab me. I love the ""end of the world"" fiction novels, but this one just didn't make for a good read.Save your time and read ""Patriots, the coming collapse"" instead."
1,I had to stop after about 100 pages...,"I threw away ""The Collapse"" after less than 100 pages in. I was starting to get nauseated by the blatant white supremacist overtones of the book. Throw in terrible writing, and laughable spell-checking, and it was money wasted."
1,No Show,"I was invited to write this review about Total Books' job performance in delivering eight copies of L'École des femmes. I ordered these books on or around Sept. 27. It is today Oct. 27 and I have neither received the books nor any explanation as to why I have not received them. I am beginning to suspect that I have been ripped off. I had to give at least one star for my comment to go through, but in fact, I give them a zero."
4,Works great!,"At first, the quality threw me off. Once I set it up, I realized that it doesn't matter that some of the materials are cheap. This system works well and even comes with the dirt in each section. All you do is set it up and add water, then the soil pellets turn to soil in seconds. No need to water anything by hand- you just add water once."
1,Flimsy Tray,"The Tray is very thin, cheap plastic, won't last long.The rest of it is ok, the seed starting pellets are kinda cool."
2,not useful enough for purchace,cheap construction allowing one time use only medium low germination rates. standing watter breeds seed born pests and dieseases!
2,Some opinion,"I just purchased this CD. Yet it is a dissapointment. There seems little coordination between the violinist and the orchestra. All pieces are played too fast, by my opinion, especially the 1st movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. It is even somewhat disastrous. It sounds as if everyone is in a rush to catch a train. Perlman's version is much better. The Mendelssohn pieces are better. However, they are still to my dislike."
4,Heifetz the speeddemon,"That Heifetz can awe the listener with his violin virtuosity is beyond dispute. Listen to these, love them if you wish to, and then listen to David Oistrakh paying the same works (admittedly in monaural and on Melodiya). That's when you don't hear the miracles but instead the music.I remember when the original version of this CD first came out that I thought, ""It's not possible to cram this music onto one CD (time limits were shorter then."". Well, he did it, but was it music or just a mad rush to cram all of this onto one CD?I'm still amazed at his virtuosity, but that's not enough any more.If you're new to classical music, the Tchaikovsky is worth the purchase price.Beethoven: Violin Concerto; Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto [Hybrid SACD]"
1,Junk,Very disappointed in this item. It did not work with any of our tvs. Waste of money. Company did not return e-mails after I tried to contact them.
1,good brice bad product.,I tried several times and with several tvs(differents brands) but the product don't work.I think the price is too low but it isn't worth it
2,Cool in theory but not in execution.,"I thought that this remote would be a cool gadget to prank my family with, but the range was heavily limited the remote itself wasn't a very quality product. For the price it is, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you do decide to buy this, know that it took more than 20 seconds on average to recognize/take control of a T.V."
1,Cheap,I wouldn't buy another one ... i did what the instruction said and nothing happen on 2 TVsPast it off to my kid ...
5,5 Stars all the way,"first of all this was the fastest shipping i've ever seen. and the remote, works beauitifuly. i love changing the channel or turning off the tv then watching my brother get pissed off. i havnt got a chance to put this to the test yet, scince i just got it today, but i look forward to it. thanks!"
1,Crappy!!!!,DON'T BY IT WASTE!!!!!! OF YOUR MONEY!!!!! Okay when i got it in the mail it was all chipped up. How crappy is that? Please don't get this item. There is a reason that its only a couple of dollars!!!
2,mini tv remote,"for the price i guess i shouldn't have expected more. the old, you get what you pay for, holds true here. it functions poorly as compared to one i bought from another manufacturer for a little more money. on the positive side, it was shipped quickly"
2,bed,it is not works properly and not works on the most of the brands. on /of key is not works and also not works program switch up key
2,Mad that i got the wrong remote!,"Well to start off the shipping was fast for me so good on that part. But, I am mad that I payed the higher price of the ninja universal remote, but got the supposedly not as good micro spy remote. For me it has worked on all the new tvs i tried except for the brands of Vizio and and brand called Insignia which was what was in a restraunt i was at. So overall its ok but get a cheaper version not from here or find a different seller for the ninja remote cause it is supposed to have more tvs that it works for.P.S. I forgot to mention that when i called to ask for a refund or something they said i would have to send in the current remote and get a refund, then replace the order and they said if i get the bad one again the would remover the seller I said too much work lol."
5,Awesome,I got one for myself about a year ago. I knew it would be the perfect gift. I gave one to my buddy for his birthday and he couldnt wait to use it. works on almost any t.v. this was also shipped fast.
1,Mine was useless,"I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item from the person selling out of Hong Kong. You wait weeks for it, and then if the thing doesn't work, you're out of luck (and a few dollars). Neither of my remotes worked. All I received as customer support was an email reiterating the instructions for use. Not very helpful."
4,Works,"Easy to program. Buttons are a pain in the butt to press. Range is pretty dang small. But for the price and size, pretty good!"
2,Cheap!,"BLEH!!! It's pretty cheap, not great. Doesn't even work on my tv so i have yet to test it. wahhh"
2,Doesn't work on newer televisions,Arrived on time and in good condition. I read both good and bad reviews on this but thought I would give it a shot for the money.
4,Remembering It All,"`David Williams gives a matter-of-fact description of his experiences in the Pacific on a destroyer minelayer during WWII. In doing so he brings back the hopes and fears of the times as well as a feeling of what it was like being an American in Tokyo Bay when Japan surrendered, which may bring a tear to the eye. Anyone involved in the war in the Pacific would enjoy this account, as would those who would like to understand the feelings of the men involved in that epic struggle."
4,Bang Bang Bang Bang,This cd slams your poor wittle cerebelum. Almost totally relentless baring some transitions. A great cd to drive with. 37 tracks give you a lot of tunes for the buck however I wish it had a longer dash of metal head song 3. The Seek and Destroy sample just rocks. Its now a new favorite of mine though its been around for a while. Keep it movin'!
2,Incomplete,"You guys really missed the point. Nobody is going to pay $30 for half of a season. Wake up. The correct price is $15. I have the first seven seasons on DVD, but as Strother Martin would say...""you gotta get your mind right."" It's just not worth it. I'm not buying it."
1,Two and a Half Men Review,"Received a damaged product, one of the disks worked fine, the other was too scratched up and water damaged to even watch"
3,silly,This is a very silly show. I laugh a lot when I like this. If you are conservitave minded Charlie's jokes are often dirty. It dosn't bother me as much as the violence in some shows though.
5,Two and a half mens demise!,"A better name for this fiasco would be,(Two and a half men, incomplete last season).I really feel bad for all of the dedicated fans that have followed and enjoyed the antics of the men, for so many years. We will no longer have this jewel of a show, because of over size egos."
4,Good deal,"Product arrived on time and was as advertised. Have not used it yet, but I suspect it will be of the same quality as all CMT products."
5,"Nice cut, lots of configurations","This is my first CMT router bit and I am very happy with it so far. I can't speak to the longevity of the carbide, but for some jewelry boxes I made in exotic woods this Christmas I am pleased with the outcome. The carbide is on an angle to get a shearing action instead of perfectly perpendicular to the router. I bought this set with the 3/4 inch cutting height for more flexibility and at the time it was actually cheaper than the set with the 1/2"" cutting height. Nice little box to store it in as well. I will look to CMT for future bit purchases."
2,A Poor Read,"This book spent so much time trying to minimize the impacts of the Inquisition that, grasping for facts, left the prose stiff and dry. Perhaps like the arguments the author made, also stiff, dry and strained.The issue is not how many died and that the prison conditions were not bad compared to regular felons. Kamen misses the point. The Inquisition did not target felons but, to use an old phrase, those who marched to a different drum.That is the real tragedy of the Inquisition. It stifled thought... and perhaps silenced many who would have contributed much to Spanish political thought and culture."
3,Not bad - they are wonderful authors,"Prof Mather treats 3 brilliant and unjustly-neglected women authors from the first half of the 19th century. Although none is quite as brilliant as Jane Austen the link is perceptive, and the delicious social comedy more pronounced. Delafield in particular is due for a big revival END"
1,How did this get published?,"I simply cannot believe this book has accumulated 3 1/2 stars from readers. The entire time I was breezing through this ""novella"" I was remembering my second grade teacher scolding me for always finishing my stories with ""And then I woke up."" While the writing may be intentionally sparse, the narrative construction borders on adolescent. By the time you finish, you'll have wished you saved a couple dollars and gone to the movies... or better yet, rented Jacob's Ladder and ordered a pizza."
1,Pointless Read,"This book, was at the most, strange. At the least, boring. I didn't understand the point. If I wanted to read about consciousness and dreamlike states I would read a non-fiction book. This just didn't do it for me. It takes you through an attack(which was weakly described) to a man in a coma, who appears to wake, then realizes all his experiences since the accident are a dream in his comatose state. I found it to be pointless, and wondered throughout the book, is there a point to all this? The ending was anticlimactic, and really wasn't an ending at all."
2,Very poor,"This is the kind of thing one writes in their first Creative Writing class -- and properly never shows anyone ever again. Unimaginative, unoriginal, sloppily constructed, and it ends poorly.Anyone who has read Phillip K. Dick (and if you haven't, buy something by him instead) will be amazed at the shallow work here. I give it an extra star for the woodcuts, which are attractive and clever."
3,Snorefest with some intellect.,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this novel.After seeing 28 days later, I really enjoyed Alex Garland's writing style.This, however, never went anywhere.The story begins with the protagonist (I say protagonist because you never learn his name, his occupation, in fact, you never learn why he was on the subway to begin with) on a subway. After standing up to some bullies, he is knocked out.That's as much as you'll probably be interested in, because the story never really ""takes off"" after there.And then the ending just comes. Suddenly it appears in front of you, and you're left to accept it.Skip this and read ""The Beach""."
1,One of the WORST books I've ever read,"First off, I just want to say that if I could give this book no stars, I would. I hated it. Janet is a self-obsorbed annoying brat. She judges people on the most shallow things. I can totally relate to her whole family, who all hate her. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Boring!,"I loved the first four books, but seeing as I love this series as much as I do I DON'T want to wait 3 months to have to read something that I read years ago! I think that this series has a lot going for it, but if more diaries keep coming out while readers are farther ahead NO ONE WILL BUY THEM!"
3,at least better than 5150,"Most of the album is good.Eddie still shows he ""has it"", but his extremly good rocking guitar doesn't sound as good like it used to be against david lee roth, but sammy is still able to hold up on the lead vocals. My favorite song in which sammy hagar sings on is the first song of the album, mine all mine. this album is not good. but it isn't bad eithier. after this one, van halen started to rise to my appreciastion with F....., well you know what it is."
3,"""Finish What Ya Started""","Van Halen, ""Sharp and Hard"", a cup of coffee and I am ready to go with this CD. This is my first CD from the start and Van Halen my first concert. This album is ""ROCKS"", Sammy Van Haggar you really rock. You are the best and rock down the doors with this album and those before and beyond.David Lee Roth, you're great only Sammy rocks right down to his shorts. Sammy Rock On."
2,Good Watch but Battery dies fast,"Do not know if this was a coincidence, but when I received this watch it didn't work at all, most likely it was a battery issue, we shipped it back and received a replacement and the battery lasted exactly two months, So it may be that the battery was in the watch for a few years until it was shipped to me, but the experience I had wasn't great"
2,not adjustable,"First let me say, this is a nice watch, quality, stylish, great price, BUT, the bracelet isn't adjustable. Well, you can remove links to make it smaller but if your wrist is bigger than about 7 3/4"" you should pass on this watch. I'm amazed that the size of bracelet wasn't mentioned in the product description, (and I looked). If your wrists are small then this watch will be too loose!"
4,Good book for the layman,"I bought this book to learn how to do the simpler things on my Corvette (I'm not a professional mechanic) and it fits the bill wonderfully. It has a lot of detailed pictures and procedures that are easy to understand and follow. I don't know that I'll try and rebuild the engine using their procedures (too complicated for me) but it does give you an overview so if you do have to take it in you at least know what the mechanic is talking about or going to work on. I felt money spent on this book was money well spent, especially if you have a car that constantly has some little thing going wrong with it and you don't want to take it to the shop each time."
3,so-so how-to,"Good for simple things, not comprehensive enough on the harder stuff, the very reason most backyard mechanics would need it. And ""reverse the procedure"" isn't always how to put things back once removed."
4,Marine Art of Geoff Hunt,"This book is very accessible and the prints are large and well done. I bought it primarily to add to my library of Patrick O'Brian related material and was pleasantly surprised by how engaging it was to read it. The text is written by the artist; while reading, it felt like I was in a conversation with him about his work. I am not knowledgeable about art and I found his conversations about how he approaches a painting, illustrated with sketches and preliminary studies, to be informative and enjoyable to read. It certainly works well also as good O'Brian background material, with the prints of book covers, other works focused on ""Nelson's Navy"" and reports of dialogues between Hunt and O'Brian. If you buy it, pick it up and read it; don't just set it on the coffee table for your guests."
2,Spend the extra money and get a proper one,"I had one I got at Crate and Barrel for $8, but it was the size of a big soap bar and worked great. This one is itty bitty and I don't find it works really well."
5,My daughter loves the series,"The Magic Tree House sure has the magical power to keep my daughter, a very active 7 year old, in her room for at least a few hours everyday. She just love these books! I will get the rest of the series for her very soon!"
1,Never got it,we never got t my son was really sad. He wad looking forward to reading these books. Maybe next time
4,Great series,My 8 year old nephew enjoys this series and I liked that it comes in a box set. Decent price.
5,Great books for young readers!,"My son LOVES this series, great for younger readers and I even find the books fairly interesting. Obviously they are written for young readers, but he enjoys it when I read them to him as well and will read them over and over again!"
4,Good Storys,I bought these books for my niece who needs to read more. She has not put them down since Christmas. I'm hoping she will request the next set soon.
5,"Good Product, missing attached brochure","Overall the product is excellent, not only for in-class study, but as a good guide as well. Other class mates, including the professor too, indicate that when buying ""Keys to College Studying"", make sure it contains the ""RESEARCH NAVIGATOR"", which is an attachment brochure that has to come with the book. Unfortunately in my case there was no ""Research Navigator"" included, but finally it is kind of OK.THANK YOU"
4,Another great collection from David Leavitt,"I've enjoyed all of David Leavitt's books and never fails to disappoint, except that I wanted some of the stories to go on and on and on. His stories are brilliantly written and his subject matter superb."
1,NOT for all Uniden phones using BT-446 model battery,"This is more of a NOTE to would-be buyers.I bought this due to all the good reviews and the description that it's for Uniden cordless phones using model BT-446 battery. When battery arrived, it turns out this battery had a specific list of Uniden phones listed on its packaging. My Uniden cordless phone using BT-446 was NOT on the list ! Why that list is NOT part of the product description is anybody's guess.Allowing MY stupidity to take over, I still tried to see if maybe it would still work on my phone.Bad move. It burned my phone in just a few minutes. Now I have one less phone. Again, that part is MY mistake. If Amazon still does not show a list of phones that this battery works with, just remember tocheck the packaging when you receive the battery and don't do as I did. Return it if your phone is not on the list."
3,The Art of Rigging,"I feel this book would benefit a teacher instructing a studient, or an ex-sailor; like my husband. I had to ask for his help. I am re-searching old sailing methods and the Art of Rigging is beneficial for this purpose."
4,A Nice Integration for Quantum Physics and Psychology,Stephen DeBerry did a wonderful job of integrating quantum physical principles with the classical principles in this instructive book on what he terms Quantum Psychology. The exploration begins with an examination of the classical mode of exploration and the negative ramifications of this approach. DeBerry offers an integrative approach to the science of psychology that focus on process over content.
1,Horrible - This guy is a clown not a writer,This is one of the worst books ever. I can't believe that it actually got published. I will use it in my cat's litter box.
2,Fook this,"For those primarily involved in the noise-drenched, atonal reverb familiar to primitive industrial acts such as early Ministry or Skinny Puppy in minimal mode, Fook will feel right at home in the collection. For all others judging content based simply on what is there, unfortunately there is not a whole lot besides the lousy anarchic posturing amidst bleak, underdeveloped electronica and monster-like vocals."
5,Fabulous read!,An engrossing tale about a young girl who encounters only brief moments of happiness in her short life. Fans of Phillippa Gregory will be immensely pleased by this novel. Loved it!!
5,Fantastic fiction,"Alison Weir does a fantastic job of fictionalizing the life of the Lady Jane Grey. If you enjoy reading historical novels that are based on good, sound research, this is a book you don't want to miss. Lacking most of the sensationalist dribble that plagues many other author's styles, Ms. Weir embellishes the everyday life of Jane Grey with sufficient detail to bring you along with each of the ""contributors"" of the novel. Written as a compendium of journals of the most significant people in the drama that was her life, Lady Jane Grey is revealed with a multiple perspective that allows the reader to observe the tragedy that was only one of the parade that marks the Tudor era."
4,Great Kids Bible!,"Would Recommend for the child who has just begun a relationship with Jesus Christ, very informative and gives lots of details."
1,The worst Disney film I have ever seen,"Disney has never been known for its sensitivity to racial stereotypes, but the depiction of Master Little in this film was like an odd, anachronistic hold-over from a WWII-era propaganda flick. It is hard to imagine that it was created a mere ten years ago.My biggest regret is that we watched the entire film. I hope that this review spares someone else the pain."
2,Disappointing,"The ads made this seem like a wonderful movie, but when my child and I saw it we both felt let down. The story line was mediocre, the characters lacked depth, the animation was so-so. We will never have any desire to see it again. This is the first time I've been tempted to return a movie I bought simply because I didn't like it."
2,Whistle an Unhappy Tune....,"What started out as a promising idea, (An animated version of a classic broadway show) Turned out to be a woefully misguided flop. In trying to compete with disney, Warner Bros simply tried to imitate the disney style without the substance. Oh sure, the voices are good enough, but not memorable and the changes in the plot were unecessary and at times ridiculous. Had they simply animated one of the existing soundtracks to this classic musical (the broadway revivial with lou diamond phillips would have been great to use) the film as a whole would have turned out much better. Over all the film is rentable, but only barely. If you want to have your kids see ""the King and I"" stick with the Bryner/Kerr film version."
1,Is there a way to give a movie negative stars?????,"Before I begin dishing this out for Disney, I will give my one (and ONLY) praise about this movie. The music in it is beautifully written. It's only too bad the rest of the movie couldn't have been this good.If anyone out there is thinking of renting/buying this movie and showing it to their kids, expecting it to be an animated version of the original, FORGET IT. Wait until they're old enough to see the really thing. This movie would be good as a stand-a-lone, if they had been the first to make the whole thing up. But it is a true disgrace to compare this to the original film. Even the story line strays from what we would all expect to see...."
1,The Worst Movie I have Ever seen!,"I was watching this with my sister while babysitting her.It is a watse of time and money. The animation was horrendious. Who does the voices? Totally fake! Oh and that cheesy Siamiese accent, what's up with that?!! I didn't even like the original so this was SUPER annoying!"
1,"It was very bad, a waste of $2.50 to rent.","I have seen Anna and the King of Siam, and the King and I. I have to be honest, and say that this is the worst version I have seen. I like Anna and the King of Siam the best. It would have best not the make this video. I lived in Thailand for 2 1/2 years so this special for me. I do not thank that you will sell very many copies in Thailand, and I do not think that you will sell many copies in the United States. Someone should have read the book, and watched both movies before making this pile of trash."
5,My children love it.,The music is great and fun. Action is eye catching for younger children and adult too. Great family movie get we need to think what other are feeling also in are working with people.
1,"Was not what was listed, or pictured","I was very disappointed with this listing. It was not at all what was listed or pictured. The picture is false on what the item is. The picutre is of the cartoon and the product ended up being some older adult version of this movie ""The King and I."" Not impressed."
2,Ok if looking for a short favorable biography,I suggest anyone serious about reading on Nimitz skip this and go to Potter's work. It appears to be primarily drawn from Potter... not sure what the author intended to accomplsih here. We could sure use a new Nimitz biography.
1,Should not be selling this Monitor!,"Horrrible...The screen showed white across while on, color very faded, white circle in corner, and volume doe's not work:/ Not recommended!"
4,"Great Monitor, stand could use some work","I purchased this HP monitor a few months ago. I was originally looking at the LG or Samsung. This model had the glossy screen and was cheaper. I always check out the reviews on Amazon, even though I didn't buy it from them. I did get a DVI cable with this, however I am not using it right now and the picture is still way beyond my old CRT or the LCD I have at work. I didn't notice how good it was until I found a website of 1680x1050 wallpapers and have the same picture on my home PC and Work...Now the Down side.... This monitor stand looks great but is not as stable. Small movements of the desk are translated to the screen. It really bothers my wife, I can deal with it. I have even thought of wall mounting it. That being said, I am very happy with the purchase."
5,Heifetz is the best!,"Bach and Heifetz! Sometimes both names appear on the discussions, but it depends what are you looking for. If you know that music should be always alive in each single note this recording is for you. If you like to listen amazing polyphony this recording is for you. If you are looking for the fantastic energy this is for you.If you are looking for the sound like tear of the soul this is for you.Everybody try to discuss Heifetz, but he is more than violinist and his laws belong only to him."
2,Cold Virtuosity,"I don't think that anyone would argue against the amazing virtuosity of Heifetz, but many, including myself, have found his weakest link to be his cold approach to many of the pieces he performed. I find his performances of the Bach partitas and sonatas for solo violin to be emotionless and rushed. Performances by Milstein, Perlman, and Sitkovetsky are more enjoyable, better recorded, and plumb the considerable depths of these pieces to a greater degree than does Heifetz, matchless virtuosity notwithstanding."
5,Very Nice Watch for the Money!,I really enjoy wearing this watch. You can't beat the price and it isa very classy piece.
4,Very nice design watch but too small for a man,"This is a terrific watch for the price, the metal band has a nice mirror polish finish, it has a clean and uncluttered dial, and the metal band is extremely comfortable, which is unusual since most cheap watches have a tinny and cheap metal band, but with regret overall the watch size is too small for a man, it's more for a woman or a teenager, what was Casio thinking?"
4,Classic Sperrys,"They were too big so I sent them back, but besides that they were completely perfect. They looked just like any new pair of shoes you would buy at a store. If they were the right size I definitely would have kept them."
5,Sperrys are the best!,"Unfortunately I had to return these because I ordered the wrong size for my daughter, but I have a pair and they are GREAT. They're a little tight at first, but they stretch out over time."
4,Shoes,Shoes are nice but I think they run a tad small. I can't just slip my foot in and go. Should have ordered a half size bigger.
5,"Warne Quality, solid","I installed these mounts with a Redfield Revenge 6-18 x 44mm Varmint on Warne 2 piece bases onto a Howa 1500 .243 heavy barrel. It went easy for the install. I had a few options for ring to scope spacing based on how I installed the bases to get the best eye relief and Objective to barrel clearance. They seem solid and I hope to fire it this weekend to get it zeroed in. I can't imagine I'll have any issues. Great product, Quality for sure.William"
3,A good history lesson,"How To Write Science Fiction & Fantasy by Orson Scott Card spells out the history of sci-fi and fantasy and gives advice on how to continue the tradition with your own work. Card has read so many old books that it boggles my mind. I wish I'd read as many books as he has. He's also written some great books, so he knows what he's talking about. This book was one of the first books I read about writing when I started my career as a fantasy author. It definitely helped me get published and gave me valuable information about the genre that I love. It's not essential, but a good treatise on the history of the f/sf genre.Paul Genesse, Author & Copy Editor[...]"
5,Great Book,"In this book, Orson Scott Card uses his own experiences to illustrate the process of writing. Fans may appreciate his personal stories - I certainly enjoyed hearing about where some of his ideas came from and how they were developed.Beyond that, however, he gives practical and inspirational advice about how to write that can be applied to any genre (although he focuses on SF and fantasy). Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in writing."
5,Could have been titled how to succeed as a SF author,"I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my son who is a college freshman and an aspiring writer. Since I had time I thought I would go ahead and read it myself. My son is quite a Olsen Scott Card fan, as am I. I found the book very easy to read and rather than the feeling of a college professor lecturing a student on the fundamentals of writing SF, it felt much more like a close friend was giving friendly advise on how to succeed in being an author. I am very pleased with the book as I am sure that my son will be."
3,Good but nothing i didn't already know,"Being an aspiring SF author myself i have read a few books like this, i picked this one up mainly because of the author's name (i was a huge fan of ""Ender's game"" back in high school)There is nothing particularly wrong with this book, all the advice is fairly sound although some of the SF magazines he mentions don't exist anymore. There is just nothing really stunning about this book that makes it stand out from the crowd of other how to write books.So ultimately i would say good but not brilliant, worth a read but nothing special"
4,Special Insight For Science Fiction Writers,"This is the first book I have read on how to write. I bought it because I like Card's books and I want to write someday. I really, really enjoyed the book because you get a view into a writer's mind and tips from his extensive experience. He also talks about writers that have influenced him and some I had never heard of before."
3,Not what I thought,"This is a nice book that didn't tell me anything I wasn't already aware of. I had gotten it for ideas and suggestions of markets and he spends about 10 pages on that and even then I didn't find out anything I couldn't have (and already hadn't found out) on the internet. The rest of the 140 is on his perspective of what the elements of good storycraft are within the confines of speculative fiction. If you have little or no experience with the speculative fiction genres (science fiction and fantasy and their associated sub-genres) then this is probably good reading, if not required reading."
3,The cover is different,The cover of the book I got is different. It has no image on it - just plain text of the title and author. Don't really care about that though since the actual contents of the book looks fine.
4,Purchased as a gift,I bought this CD as a gift for a child who likes to watch Laurie Berkner on TV. The childs parent says they listen to the CD in the car and that they all enjoy it.
4,Good CD,My little girl's school has this CD and recommended it to me. My daughter loves it! She especially loves the dinosaur song and the song about putting on your glasses and reading your book. We have it in the car and my daughter loves to listen to it when we are going to various places. It keeps her entertained and occupied.
2,top woobly,we bought this for my grandaughter to sleep over and even though the bottom is in tight the whole rail can be leaned out easily far enough for a small 3 or 4 yr old to get stuck in....our mattress is really thick so only aboout 8 inches sticks up past the bed and it's still wobbly......I bought it on line and now have to spend alot to return it.....
4,Really like it but...,"I only purchased one of these because I wanted to try it out, despite the reviews. I read the instructions and it only took about 10 minutes to put it together and install it. However, I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to get the rail to lower. I know I'm supposed to pull up on each side at the same time, bit it doesn't do anything except lift the mattress with the bed rail. It's very sturdy, and my 3-year old son likes it. I'm sure once I figure out how to get the rail to fold down, I would rate it 5 stars."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this product thinking it would keep my 1 year old from falling out of bed while we were on vacation. He & I had to share a bed and I was worried about the open end by him. I put the bed rail together exactly as the instructions said and hooked it up to the bed, between the mattress and box spring, per instructions. We both went to sleep and I was awoken in the middle of the night to my baby falling out of the bed. The bed rail simply swung out of the way, doing nothing to stop him from landingon the floor. I do NOT recommend this product!"
3,"Good Product, but overpriced","This bed rail larger than we expected, and works exactly as we hoped.We use it in our upper bed on our motor-home, for the kids.However, it is overpriced and shipping costs a fortune."
4,Good Bed Rail for a Toddler,"I am happy with this product. It is very sturdy and easy to install. My 2 year old was ready to move to a bigger bed. We used this on a twin size bed/mattress, so it does not cover the entire length of the twin bed, but it still works very well to prevent her from falling out. We actually appreciate the space at the end because she can crawl into and out of her bed easily, and she likes the big bed much better now. I think that she feels much safer. It is made of metal, mesh, and material which completely covers the metal. So we just put a pillow against it at night to pad it, and she loves it!"
5,Piece of cake,"When researching which one to buy I read so many terrifying reviews about bed rails in general, how it took hours to assemble or the child still fell off the bed, but THIS BED RAIL IS GREAT! It came and I told my husband, 'okay I might need you help because these things are a hassle,' but turns out I probably could have assembled it with one hand! GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,Stick this disk in the microwave and watch what happens.,"Why did someone actually believe that this clown is worthy of a record contract? Just because he is a celebrity DOES NOT qualify him to be a musician. All tracks are a joke- especially his 'fantasy.' He is no hardcore gangsta thug, nor is he a Brian McKnight/Joe - type singer. If you purchase this CD, you can watch your hard-earned money get direct-deposited straight into his refrigerator. To sumarize all of this, please save your cash. There are many other talented musicians out there in the sea of hip-hop."
3,House Under Snow,"I am in the middle of this one right now. The characters seem realistic, particularly the mother, Lilly and the feelings of Anna the daughter with regard to her mother- BUT, this is a tad of a slow moving book for my taste. Certain themes keep cropping up over and over, and I'm not sure where the book is headed. I still have 100 pages to go, s maybe it will pick up. So far it's average. I just finished ""The Lovely Bones"" though and that's a tough act to follow."
3,Banzai Double Drop Falls,"Banzai Double Drop FallsI purchased this for my daughter's end of the school year party. The kids had a great time. But, after one use, I found the seam had come apart by one of the arches and the thread was coming out along the seam further down by the pool part. This seems to be a common problem with this item. It does still inflate, though. I am going to return mine. Alot of money, I feel, to have it come apart after one use."
1,not worth the money,"I've had this hose for about two and a half weeks. Last night, the third time I used it, it developed a leak, actually a hole, about in the middle of the hose. I thought because this had metal couplings, it would be better quality, but I'm going to buy a Hydrohose. I had one for a number of years before it developed any problems."
4,A Little Known Sellers masterpiece....,"'The Bobo' is one of Sellers' less known films, but shows his great ability to take on a character and run with it. Although his 'Barcelona' accent is far from perfect (contrary to his great vocal renditions of other accents), this film is a delightful romp of a guy who is commissoned to get 'The Girl' (the famous model 'Britt Eckland', who Sellers married) in a 3 day period. He goes from newcomer to suave Ladykiller in those few hours. The second scene, where he introduces our Lady into a Grecian palace scene, replete with 1700's dandy, is priceless...if only we could see the outtakes...from the overly 'dandy' introduction to the manic scenes of Sellers dancing a hip modern beat....won't give away the final scenes...but this film is a true Sellers gem..."
5,"Excellent, excellent book","I can only echo what other reviewers have said: There's not a loser in the bunch. Every recipe I've tried -- and I've tried many -- turns out perfectly. I love the variations provided for most recipes, and since I frequently bake cookies to give as gifts, I find their information on the shelf life and proper storage of each cookie particularly useful.My biggest problem with this book? Deciding which of the wonderful recipes to make! It's really an embarrassment of riches.I'm about to purchase my second copy of this book, as my first (the paperback edition) has seen so much use that it's starting to fall apart!"
4,Good tape,"I am very happy with this edge banding tape. It didn't look impressive when it arrived. It didn't look like it would match my birch. After applying it with an iron and staining it, the edge band looks very good. I will try the maple tape next."
3,pros and cons,"The orchestral performance is the best orchestral performance of this opera that I've ever heard. They breeze through difficult passages as if they were child's play. The conductor must deserve some of the credit, because the change in key, tempo, and mood following ""E luvecan le stelle"" is smoothed over, whereas the change is unpleasant to me in most performances.I was disappointed with Scarpia and Tosca, though. Scarpia lacks the robusity necessary for projecting a villanous role, and Tosca's Italian diction is horrendous. There's no disappointment with Cavaradossi, though. If you're a Pavarotti fan, buy it anyway."
5,great football,It was on the wish list for my 8 year old grandson and it is a creative toy. More than one can play with it.
5,Awesome game,I've played the full version of this game...all I have to say is [DARNIT]...next thing I knew the clock was 2-3 hours past what I had previously seen it to be...a REALLY addictive game! Awesome for the racing enthusiast!
2,Needs work by manufacturer,Kennel would not latch with door hinged to left or right. About a half hour was needed to remove enough material from the four hinge/bolt bosses and the four hooks at top and bottom of door frame to allow door to latch dependably with hinge to left. It was not possible to get door to close when hinged to right.It appears that the upper kennel half molding was way out of shape.I chose to keep the kennel because it has the best system I've seen for latching top and bottom together.
1,Pathetically inept,Couldn't stomach it. What hasn't been plargarized is historically incorrect. Incomprehensible syntax. The author must be a product of Hillary Clinton's outcome-based education program.
3,"Drums - strong, compositions - weak.","This album is a great showcase for Vinnie Colaiuta, and his drums SOUND incredible. It is a worthwhile album on this basis. Keyboardist David Garfield, who was new to me with this album, also plays brilliantly on this album. But, with the exception of Palladium, the compositions are definitely weak. And I feel that Michael Landau's guitar is not always appropriate to the tune, and that for my taste, leans excessively towards the rock side of jazz-rock fusion. Too much emphasis on sounding like Hendrix on fire all the time, and not enough on listening to the context and doing something new."
5,A Tour de Force,"Compositionally sophisticated, technically breathtaking, this is an album for serious musicians who want to learn at the feet of some true masters. And this is not just a chops display, but a performance full of subtleties and dynamics.As for Vinnie Colauita, well, his playing on this album demonstrates that he among the top five or ten candidates for the greatest drummer of all time. The man was clearly born to the drum set. He combines explosive power and control with an almost mathematical intutition of the end points of rythyms, constantly playing across the bar lines but always ending up in the right place for the music. Sheer genius at work.If you are serious about improvisational music of any kind, you simply must buy this recording."
4,Give 'em a try,"O.k listen. I hated the idea of new charaters. I love the tortall setting and I thought that was the end of it all intil the first test came out. Anyway, I tried reading it and I thought hey this is pretty tight and then got absorbed in them like the immortal and song of the lioness series. I thought that i was the only persom in the world who was absest with tamora pierce book then i saw this girl reading and realized i wasn't. yeah, i know i sound like a dork.I thinl george deserved alanna. Peace"
2,"complicated (parts almost don't make sense) and boring, very boring","Sandry's Book is a book I had to read for an assignment at school. The book gives you about 100 pages of almost a Martha Stewart, Dr.Phil feeling like your watching it on tv (you'd get it if you read it - which you should NOT)and the other 152 pages are dissapointing. There's about 2 parts of excitement and they both end quickly. This novel is very, very boring and I would only reccomend this to a person that is into weaving, gardening and metalwork."
5,Sandry's Book or The Magic in the Weaving,"Four people: Daja, Sandry, Tris and Briar; are brought to Winding Circle Temple, for each of them it is their last resort. Each of them from so different ways and stations in life, but joined together by their powers, that none of them know anything about."
3,Great characters. Too much plot.,"Four young mages are saved from terrible situations and brought together to learn and grow.The beginning of this book never makes much sense to me. It jumps between the rescue of each character as though they're all happening at the same time, but they can't be because all four are found by the same person. Beyond that, it's a quick read with fun characters - I especially like Rosethorn, Daja, and Tris - and interesting worldbuilding that is outside the standard medieval fantasy setting.Unfortunately, it has the problems that most of following Winding Circle books also suffer from: too many plot threads on too few pages, and some important events happening off-page instead of on. I enjoy rereading them from time to time, but I always wish there was more to each one."
3,kind of bland,"Four children gifted with magic come together to train their powers. Along the way, they learn about trust and become friends. It's a story about magic, but it's not terribly exciting. Maybe it's because I've come to expect roaring adventures from Tamora Pierce, and this book isn't one.The story feels lacking. It doesn't have a proper villain, whether an actual person or in the metaphoric sense. The children face some hurdles with controlling their powers, but those lack the tension of a real crisis. Also, three of the four main characters (except the eponymous Sandry) are not likable because they readily antagonize each other with their prejudice. The author tries to show their personal growth, but the progress is barely there, and by the end of the book I still don't like the characters."
3,"Good, but not great.....","I first became a Tamora Pierce fan with the Alanna Series (Lioness Quartet), and then soon after read her Immortals series. Compared to them, this book is rather slow. I could relate to Alanna throuought her daily struggles with romance, secrecy and magic. But for some reason these young characters didn't seem to click. The 4 children that come from different backgrounds slowly become friends and discover that they were brought to Winding Circle to develope their unique kind of magic. I even found the climax slighly boring and predictable. It seems the only thing that keeps me reading is the fact that it looks like it might get better. I'm currently reading the next book in the series ""Tris's Book"" and hope that that one catches my interest a bit more. Please don't get me wrong, this book is exquisitely written, it just seems to be lacking a few of the traits I enjoy so much in fantasy books."
5,"Lots of fun, very energetic","As a fan of Cuban music, I picked up this disk out of curiosity and find it highly enjoyable. The music is similar to Cuban, but yet distinctive. The opening number is just fantastic (and may prompt you to get Palmieri's CD itself, which I also recommend). The next three tunes are also in a traditional vein and the disk then focuses more on -plena-. I must disagree with another reviewer, however: there is certainly more than -plena- on this disk. The first and third numbers are guajiras, the second is a traditional son, the fourth is a bolero, and the 10th is salsa. There are, indeed, four plenas, but that is fine -- this is Puerto Rican music! My only criticism is that the plenas become a little bit repetitious, but they are a lot of fun overall. The tune by Julius Melendez is a joy and I hope I can find more by him."
3,The fungi are coming...,"Plant pathology, and the development of modern methods of combating plant diseases, is probably not most peoples' first choice as far as what to read on a rainy night when you have nothing better to do. However, if you ever do get the urge, you could do a lot worse than Large's readable, and even somewhat absorbing, book on the subject. Starting with the first major outbreak of Potato Blight in Ireland in 1845, which resulted in the Irish Potato Famine, Large takes us through 1939 by looking at the ways in which science found ways to combat various diseases of crops throughout the world. Sounds dull, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Large is very good at explaining the things he's talking about, and he never gets above the reader's level of comprehension, while at the same time never talking down to the reader. A fascinating book, worth picking up if you happen across it in a used bookstore."
4,good cheap bike goggles,"why spend 10x the price for protective eyewear when cycling? These look good, fit well and airflow is fine. Super value for the price"
4,Great eye protection,"Comfortable and well made for the price. The lenses have been easy to clean and not to easy to scratch. The only reason I would not give these glasses five stars are that the rubber nose guards come off easily, and if lost would make the glasses useless. A dab of superglue fixed the problem, but that should have been done by the manufacturer."
2,Yuck,"Too dark for the range. Very cheap look to them, they look like a 1980's mistake. Uncomfortable fit for me!"
1,Too complicated,"I have been sewing for many, many, many years and always with Singer Machines.Based on reviews and price i decided to give this machine a try.It was wonderful at first, but to take apart for cleaning and oiling simply takes too much time away from my sewing projects.Plus the screwdriver supplied is so tall it would not fit under the arm, had to use my singer one.I am in the process of finding out how to return."
3,Book provides broad view of VBA capabilities and limitations,"Book teaches both concept and practice. The book is pricey, given the shallowness in its level of detail. Book would be excellent reference for person in receptionist position with organization. Good introduction to VBA, clearly written. Book should have a graphic of each MS Application's object heirarchy. Book needs more in depth description of Object Browser."
2,Weak Sister to earlier books,"A sad disappointment -- the characters did not engage me. I didn't believe the attraction that Wallingford had for the Wisconsin chick. His attraction to Angie was at least motivated by Angie's acrobatics. The biggest question was why was this novel written? What does it bring to the reader? It reaffirms marriage and family, especially the desire for sons, but only after trashing the people getting ready to commit. I agree with an earlier comment that Zajac was more interesting, but his story too fizzled into contentment. I can't recommend this novel."
1,The Fourth Hand,"I read a lot, I mean a lot, a lot....and this is the first book I have ever wanted to give a review to....I mean I feel I have to give a review, I feel compelled......I'm disappointed and I expect that many fans of Irving are also disappointed. This book really misses the mark. Sure we know that not every book can be an Owen or a Garp.....but jeez, Irving should know better and so should his editor. When something falls this short it just shouldn't be released. Maybe it makes good business sense to releaes it but from an artistic perspective it goes against the grain.In trying to meet a deadline or a contractual agreement we are left with The Fourth Hand. In trying to be too clever we have only The Fourth Hand. A story that struggles to take meaningful shape but never does. A story that tries to shape interesting characters but never does.Oh, I'll keep reading Irving though because I know what truly great writing he is capable of."
1,NOOOOOO,"I can't believe John Irving wrote this book....it was just awful. All through the book I kept thinking it must be another guy using the same name. Irving has written some great literature (in my ""book"") that I'm going to pretend I never tried to read ""The Fourth Hand"". He can do so much better."
3,My first Irving book - I'll read more now...,"The style of his writing is great - I am looking forward to reading more books of the author who uses language that easily...I think characters are very vague, the attraction of main characters does not make any scence, just as their relationship from the start. I found fascinating Irving's description of 'news making' business... Now, when I watch news, I am sure there are lots of scandals in every studio behind the scenes :p"
3,"An Immature Journalist ""Grows Up"" and Becomes Responsible","I enjoyed this book enough to read it in a single day, but I don't find myself thinking much about it since I finished it.It is the story of an immature journalist who grows up and transforms toward the end of the book. The book focuses heavily, but realistically, on the main character's sex life. He actually highly reminded me of someone I used to know, years ago, in his experiences. He could have been that person talking, in his experiences with women. I would not recommend this book to anyone who might be offended by reading continuously about the main character's sex life. Nevertheless, this is not really what the book is ABOUT. It's about the growth and transformation of the main character.I did find the main character interesting, and the minor characters were also quite interesting. I enjoyed the book, but it's probably not one I would recommend to my friends."
3,Even The Master,"can throw in a clinker. I, of course, enjoyed it but it is nowhere near his best. Stop with the ""movie business"" and come back to us in 4 years with your best yet."
1,Novel or porn skript?,"I find myself sorely disappointed by this, John Irving's, last effort. The book reads like a skript of something Larry Flynt may have been interested in and meanders in such a way as to remind one of an adolecent boy's daydreams. Basically, the plot disappears behind a not so interesting character hopping in and out of bed with different women. My advise is to get the Playboy channel instead. I want my money and my time back please! Note that ""The Hotel New Hampshire"" is one of my all time favorite books."
3,Good Writer Preposterous Story,Irving starts out with an inviting plot but gets lost in a ridculous story. Hard to like or empathize with characters who make reckless decisions and do stupid things. The main character seems to be wondering around in the boys locker room and never finds his way out. Suspend reality takes on a new meaning with this story. Irving can do so much better.
1,a bad read,"This book had nothing in it for me. The characters were all wacky with no redeeming qualities. It made for a five minute discussion at our book club meeting. Luckily, the hostess had made a salmon mousse in the shape of a hand - now that was something to talk about!"
1,What a waste of time!,"Boring, slow paced, juvenile. Irving thinks he can rescue horrible writing by including all of the explicit sex he can fit into each paragraph. The man can't even tell a story! I kept waiting for the ""Catch-22"" type of comic, cosmic ending. I was certain that was where he was going. Imagine my surprise when I read to the end and found out he wasn't kidding...he was really attempting to write a story with an actual plot and characterization. What a load of crap. Don't waste your money or your time. If this is where Irving is headed, look for him in the dumpster soon with a 50-cent bottle of wine in his hand."
2,So disappointing it's suspicious,"The Fourth Hand is by far John Irving's worst book... if it is by John Irving! I agree with almost all the other reviewers. No character development, trying too hard to be funny, almost amateurish. In short, totally unlike Irving. How he could publish this book after the brilliant A Widow for One Year is beyond me. We're talking about the author of The World According to Garp, here!! Did he write it at 16? Did he write the book over a weekend to honor some kind of contractual obligation? Did his wife write it (after all, Irving himself said his wife had the initial idea - was that a hint?)? Really bizarre and suspicious."
3,Middle of the Road,"I am a John Irving fan. I have enjoyed seeing his writing mature over the years and have come to appreciate what he invests in each of his characters. ""The Fourth Hand"" is not his best work, but then again, even a modest effort from John Irving is very readable."
1,"Mr John, what happened?! You used to be interesting.","When this novel was first published last summer, I discovered it when I walked into my local .... A new John Irving novel! Oh boy! I had been pleasantly surprised by ""A Widow For One Year,"" and loved such Irving classics as ""Garp"" and ""Owen Meany."" ""The Fourth Hand"" should be a nice treat, right? Wrong. I found the characters to be superficial, not at all credible, petty, and... boring.If you like reading books about people who are selfish, have sex, whine, have sex, love football, have sex.... (you get the picture)then I am sure you will enjoy this book. However, if you are an Irving veteran, I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,An Enjoyable Read!!!,"I felt compelled to write a few words about this latest John Irving book after scanning the poor reviews other customers had written. This is John Irving! He's always been a bit quirky with his stories. And this book is no exception...it is a most unusual story of a man losing his hand to a hungry lion and finding love. If only I had such imagination! Personally, I thought it was great and read it very quickly. Unlike one reviewer, I loved how one character was obsessed with the Packers because in Wisconsin there are people like that. I also liked the way he incorporated timely news events into the storyline and got his point across about how the news is handled in this country. Not every book can be ""Cider House Rules"" or ""The Great Gatsby"" for that matter. I read to unwind and get lost in a story and I say thank you to John Irving for giving me a few hours of enjoyable escape from the world."
3,Film Friendly / Movie Method Man,"Here's what I think. As a novel, it is a bit lighter than usual, but it is refreshingly light. I'm a slow reader, and it was definitely a quick read.It was not bogged down with description. And it was a very linear narrative. Beginning-middle-end. No jumps back and forth in time.Which leads me to believe John wrote this to become a movie. Think about where he was when he was writing this..right on the heels of the Cider House Rules movie. He probably hated having to compromise and cut so much from Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and Cider House Rules, let alone the butchery of Owen Meany/Simon Birch, that this time he said screw it...since they'll probably make a movie, I'll just keep it simple from the start. No extensive backgrounds. No complex subplots. And room for a great looking lead.It will make it easier to jump from book to box office."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I read for entertainment. Irving's books are always entertaining; with their quirky characters, implausible events, overtly sexual encounters, and often tragic climaxes. The Fourth Hand is no different. It's a book of fiction...it's not real. If you want to be entertained, please read the book. If you want to read something about reserved, quiet, everyday, run-of-the-mill, stay-home-and-read characters, write and read about yourself. And if you don't like the characters, or the portrayals of specific people, please don't think the author shares these beliefs. Again, this is a book of fiction. It has made-up characters and plots. How interesting would a book be if it only told the story you see everyday? Irving adds spice to his books that give the reader the ability to escape from the everyday."
1,waste of time...,"I agree with the first reader review. This book was pointless, crude and nothing made me care about any of the characters. The protagonist was a ""30 something"" ""boy"" who was very shallow."
1,Pathetic,"I've found John Irving's past books to be wierd, so I began reading with full expectations that this one would be too. But I was unprepared for the explicit sex, and blatant (...)! I continued to the end hoping that there would be some justification for it. But if there was any, I missed it. The last book I read that compared was Kirk Douglas' autobiography. Thank goodness I got it at the library, instead of buying it!"
3,I feel that I failed!!,"I love John Irving and feel somehow that I have failed to get the depth of ""The Fourth Hand"". I just finished it and it just leaves me feeling empty and cold. However, I will always keep reading John Iring. That goes without saying."
4,FUNNY,Had me laughing out loud. Imo his funniest.The Cider House Rules is also good.A Widow For One Year is disgusting.A Prayer for Owen Meany is good.The World According to Garp. Haven't read yet.A Son of the Circus. Haven't read yet.
3,Expected more,"I am a huge John Irving fan and I did enjoy this book...but I have to admit it is definitely not one of my favorites. I have read A Prayer for Owen Meany, The Hotel New Hampshire, and The World According to Garp over and over again, but I definitely wouldn't re-read The Fourth Hand. I did enjoy the different themes that popped up over and over in the book, but I felt like a lot of storylines began, were abandoned and then never picked back up. I did like it, but I was disappointed that I didn't love it. I guess I expected a bit more from John Irving."
4,Irving is Back on Track,".... I too, have read most of Irving's other books. Some, like Owen Meany and Cider House Rules are masterpieces. He lost me with Son of Circus. He is right back in the saddle with The Fourth Hand. I wild, imaginitive ride. The writing was so discriptive, I could visualize the entire story in my head, yet I couldn't imagine a movie doing it justice. I have recommended this to many."
1,Huge Disappointment.,"Having read every published work by John Irving (yes, I even suffered through Setting Free the Bears), I look forward to each new novel.Typically the multi-year wait is rewarded with what I call ""book-gasm"". The Fourth Hand doesn't even get to verbal foreplay.The characters are weak, uninteresting individuals who never develop and about whom I never am able to care. The book further suffers from a conspicuous absence of plot. Which, normally, is not a problem since Mr. Irving's books are usually so strongly character-driven.I felt that I was reading either a first draft or a cheap romance novel. The clever turns-of-phrase and complications of sexual character that mark Mr. Irving's novels -- also absent. [....]"
3,Blue Horizon - Adventure Novel,"Liked it but its very raw (very explicit sex & violence & immorality), often has over the top events and sentimentality and a story that jumps around too much (almost like two novels in one). I almost stopped reading it but stayed with it because when Smith is at his best which happens often in this novel there is no one better at an adventure novel. If you are interested in Africa this is definately an adventure for you. Not his best but still a good high adventure yarn as long as you have a strong stomach to carry you through its crude parts.I would like to know how much of the background is accurate history."
3,"Wilbur Smith has ""sold out"" to the World & Lost my respect....","I have read almost all of Wilbur Smith's Books, starting with ""Gold Mine"" , which led to the movie, ""Gold"", about the South African Gold mining industry. In Blue Horizon, and Monsoon, he seems to have become too pre-occupied with sex and torture, attempting to meet the cravings of lustful man at his lowest points, rather than artfully depicting events with great literary expertise that once caught my eye. Read the preface to ""Gold Mine"" , where he describes the volcanic beginnings of the African Continent in vivid detail. This was the Wilbur Smith's writings that I learned to love. His more recent works are filled with violence and sadism that I, for one, prefer to avoid. None of these recent books are worth reading, buying, nor recommending to young readers. Even if you are over age 13, I highly recommend that you avoid Wilbur Smith's recent writing!"
4,Works like a capacitor,Perfect replacement for the run capacitor on my furnace. Saved a bundle here over a service call by being able to do this simple replacement myself.
1,not worth it,After reading all of the great reviews i thought this would be a great product. i have black granite counter tops and this is one of the worst products i have used. i actually cant think of anything that did a worse job. there is no shine. i even thought maybe i did not use it correctly and have used it several times and still no shine and counter tops look dull. i almost feel as if all of the reviews were left by loving family members of manufacturer.
4,Recommended Listening,"This a towering, dark album, blending the familiar industrial-metal percussive rhythms with stark, politically-charged sound samples and the menacing, often discordant tones of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. The industrial wasteland of mid-80s Thatcherism is perfectly evoked, though the album as a whole deals with a greater British historical overview.'Pax Britannica' represents the sound of Test Dept at their pinnacle, and is right up there with SPK's 'Zamia Lehmanni'. An essential!"
1,"Just buy ""Rocka Rolla"" and ""Sad Wings of Destiny""","This release (against Judas Priest's wishes) is a compilation of material off of Judas Priests first two albums Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny. If you are looking to buy some of priest's early material you would be better off just buying their albums Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in order to get all the songs. This release just seems to be aimed to gain more money out the Judas Priest name. The ""company"" also released another compilation off of material off of Priest's first two albums entitled ""The Best of Judas Priest"". Do not fall for this gimmick either. Go to Judas Priests website under the disography section and the band themselves complain about these two releases. They stated they wanted to take legal action but it is impossible to do so. As fans just don't buy this gimmick garbage. Peace out."
4,A wonderful machine,"Probably one of the most used machines in my amateur shop, it produces great results. I have not noticed a whole lot of finish difference between the 2 speeds. The finish is great with hardly any snipe. For smaller boards I bump one board against the other to eliminate snipe. The dust hood is absolutely essential and works great. The measuring gauge is very accurate and extremely handy. It is a loud machine, so please use your ear protection. The other thing is, make sure the blades are always sharp and nick free. Reversible blades are very handy. It is made in Taiwan, but built very solid and geez, quite heavy. Last advice, watch the video that comes along to get good results. Happy planing."
1,Would be great if it would actually feed the wood through,I bought this planer a little over a year ago. Gradually it started having problems feeding wood (as several others have mentioned). I have cleaned and adjusted to no avail. I would stay away from this planer.
5,Trouble free and minimum snipe,"I've used this planar for three years. It's trouble free, easy to change blades and produces a finish with an absolute mimimum of snipe (usually none)"
3,Delta 52580 Planer,"The 52580 planer does not meet Delta standards. It does not eliminate snipe. My old 12"" Delta did just as good. Also the dust pick-up is tool small where it attaches to the machine. When planing soft wood like pine or birch it will plug. I would not recomend this tool."
5,Simple bt beautiful,"I loved this book. It is a very easy read first of all, something one can do in a single sitting almost. The imagery of Heaven and especially of God on his throne with the Son and the Spirit. A beacon of glorious light. This is just as I imagine it. Thanks Ellen for a wonderful story, I'm halfway through Noah now and also enjoying it."
4,Automation for Libraries,"Saffady is managing to keep up with the ever-changing technology field. This latest edition is a survey of the current applications being used in libraries. Although details are given to hardware and software issues, the second half of the book is devoted to the ""needs"" of the library. Reference, circulation, and cataloging are all covered here, with attention given to the users of the library. This book would be for anyone who is planning a new automation system, or who are thinking about updating current applications."
5,HIP HIP HUZZAH!!!!!!,"I read INTO THE LAND OF THE UNICORNS to my kids when they were toddlers; now they are 8 and 10 years old! As soon as the new one is released, we'll be rereading the old one first. Even though my kids are both excellent readers, we still have ""family"" reading every night, including my husband. We will all be looking forward to Book Two eagerly!"
5,Hot as a green duck,"A wonderful book, and I would definitely recommend it. The adventure, and all the revealed secrets were amazing! I can't wait for the next installment of Cara's adventures."
1,So predictable,"Two society women fighting in a toy store, throwing stuffed animals, banging carts? Please. This is just plain dumb. Then the love interests are so ridiculous and predictable it's enough to make me delete it from my Kindle. A ten year old would be able to see the impracticality of so called adults behavior.I thought the Cedar Cove series at least had some interesting moments and fairly believable characters but this book is so unbelievable I can't believe anyone bothered to publish this."
3,Puts you in the spirit,Good read and quick. Another winner from the author. I hope they make it into a great lifetime movie for next year.
2,Not Worth the $$ or the Time,"I agree with Laura B. that this book was very disappointing. While there were some parts of the book that had very deep meanings, the book as a whole was boring and difficult to hold my attention, in my opinion. I would definitely not recommend this book for leisure reading, but be prepared to yawn a lot if you're reading it for a class."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"After reading so many good reviews of this movie, I thought it would be at least decent. NOT. Absolute waste of time. Pointless, to me, anyway. Come on people, wake up."
1,Not even worth watching!,Not Jeffrey Ross's best.I was very disappointed with this video.He needs to stay on comedy central with the celebrity roasts.
2,Dissapointing,"I love Jeff's roasts but that is his limit. Unlike Greg Giraldo who has a huge range comedy beyond the roasts, Jeff is all about the insults. It is funny for a while but then gets boring."
2,Best of the King Games,"Best of the King games even though that isn't saying very much. This one can be fun, especially multi-player. Great for family entertainment."
3,BK game.,"I actually got this game before i got an xbox 360 from someone that bought it from Burger king. This game is originally for the xbox, but it includes both xbox and 360 versions. In this game, there is single race, championship, multiplayer, and most fun LIVE. In this game you get to race BK charecters such as a chicken, the king himself, a drive through orderer guy, and not much more. Live, the best part of the game can be very fun online against people. It has 5 tracks to go to which are very short. This game has excellent graphics even though it is a cheap game, made by burger king, and not to mention that its relly meant for the first xbox. I do not care for this game but it is alright for a cheap game with online features."
2,Too Small and Only 3 yrs old and Up,"Ok, my previous review got thrown away by the website. Oh well. I dunno' what happened. Anyway, this doll is very small and not suitable for a child under 3 y.o. The other dolls offered here and show up in the Also Suggested part of the item page, made by Mattel, in this style, don't uniformly list the dimensions, weight or age suitability of this doll. This doll is just ok because it's really too small to be played with by a toddler. A 3 y.o. would want to hug it and coddle it, like a baby doll. And it's Made in China, which may or may not matter in this item's case."
2,Battery Charger Failure also,"I agree with other reviewers, the Firestorm charger and/or battery seems to be defective in my opinion. I have three batteries (having bought several Firsetorm products) and at least two charges and, guess what, none of the chargers/batteries work any more. Last one to fail was today (8-21-05) which is why I'm searching the net to see if anyone else has had this problem. Like the products fine but, no battery, no workie, so how good a deal is that. Sounds like DeWalt or Makita are the way to go. A shame, I have always liked B&D products but not if they're selling cr*p like this."
5,Unbearable Suspense; Excellent Submarine Tale,"The book grabs you early and takes you on a whirlwind ride of a tale involving a ""hard luck"" sub and how the crew, despite no small amount of inner intrigue and turmoil, rises to the occasion, culminating in a suspenseful climax. Cooke draws his characters nicely and helps you form opinions about each. His knowledge of submarines and their unique brand of warfare helps carry the plot along. And the plot absolutely zings as it flows. Great story. Great read."
2,"Doesn't mean much, apparently","This book was assigned reading in an introductory philosophy course and I am very, very glad I read it at the end of the year rather than at the beginning (although it is too simple for a college level course in any case), because Nagel's conclusion suggests it's all an exercise in futility!. Although it is a good introduction to some of the major questions of philosophical enquiry for complete beginners, I feel that Nagel should have included some recommended reading at the end of each chapter for those who need more depth, especially for readers who are not using this book as part of a course in philosophy. Those same readers might well be put off by the dour ending of the book which strongly hints that (1) any God is merely a God of philosophical gaps (2) ultimately life has no meaning and (3) those who look for meaning are probably taking themselves too seriously. Why do philosophy then? And why write a book about it!?"
5,4 player co-op is excellent,"If you enjoyed Halo and Halo 2, buy this game immediately. I don't know and don't really care what people don't like about this. They're probably Sony representatives trying to hold down the thrashing they'll take this holiday season. Halo 3 is great fun. The ability to play campaign mode with 4 player co-op is a blast. It may not be as ""pretty"" or ""immersive"" as some other titles, but it's a lot more fun than Gears or Bioshock if you like multiplayer gaming."
4,nice graphics,violent. is it me or has the video game industry lost their damn minds. I like milder games and this is not one of them.
4,Pretty Close but not the best of the Series,"Here is the break downHalo 1= SOLID Story really pulled you into the problem and keep you in the storyHalo 2= Just couldnt provide that same story feel, but the online was first of its kind on a console to attract such hardcore FPS massesHalo 3= Solid Story but could have done the first part of the game better I mean the jungle level was very generic and linear, and the bunker levels were a waste however; towards the end this game really take off and pushes it , and the inclusion of the new vehicles was greatMultiplayer is solid although it doesnt have the same affect as 2, because well, we played 2 and were ready for it but its just a much more polished multi now but nothing new and ground breakingI recommend getting this if I had to rate them it would go in this order1, 2, 3But overall, buy them all its just a great story and I got a hunch its not over yet..."
1,Not what I expected,"This game is not even close to being fun unless you like the 2 dimentional game. I expected 3 dimentional, 1st person gaming. Commercials show it to be entirely different than the actual game."
1,Ho Hum Game in an Average Franchise,"Hype is about all that this game has going for it. I consider this game on par with the Zune player. It works and does what you think it does but is it worth the money or fantastic? No. Not at all.I would pass on this and consider that the whole proposition is a scam. You overpay for a game with crappy graphics (I mean, have you seen the character models) and then you have to pay $5 dollars to play with these rude clowns who will personally attack you if you don't swear by it.It just makes the whole thing that much more useless. Everyone knows that the Xbox360 will be abandoned like Xbox in a year or so and personally, I'm mad too that I drank the Kool-Aid but then again, I also bought a first generation iPod and a new one this year. So goes the expendable income story.Don't believe hype. You can buy people's attention spans in the same way that MS bought market share in the gaming industry. Seriously, there's nothing to see here. Move along."
3,Halo3 killed my Xbox 360,"After playing this game casually, I am getting the 3 flashing red lightsfinally. So Gears of War froze my 360, Halo3 finished it. Back to therepair shop. Can't give an all around opinion because I only started playing Halo3. 360 is too weak to handle high def and demanding games.Just got back a new 360, a different one from the one I sent in for repair. Let's hope it lasts. Game is rather short, my kids finished theeasy level in an afternoon."
4,Still not better than the first.,"I say its not better than the original not because of the classic first reason. But it isn't better than the first b/c the enemies were more challenging. The elites could heal and truly recover in the first one.Thus making them much much more challenging. However in part two, we started to combat the brutes more and more and now in part 3. Its all brutes for the most part. They provide little to no challenge. Sure they take cover as well, but they do not regain whatever was lost in any fashion at all. So if they are one shot away from dying before they hide for 2hours, they'll still be one shot away from dying when you find them again. Other than that, Halo 3 is pretty much like all the other ones. And the online battles are still aimed towards kids. Its just a matter of getting to the right spots and getting the right items and what not like always."
5,halo dues,man oh man is what i thought when i bought this game with my 360 when i got this well ive gotta put this out there the storie fun but short but honestly who really bought this for the storie you bought it to pown and own any one in your way on line thats it if you do not have abox live then to me useless unless you have freinds with 360s than you can system link thats still awsome to me if you like halo and a halo fan boy its worth checking out if you have xbox live or if you cant afford it and still want to play halo online check out xkai for system link online to me halo should be in your game collection its awsome iam out peeps
4,can't wait for halo 4,"Game was great! Plus, I had a gift certificate, so I could pick put whatever game I wanted that day! Thanks AUNT DENISE!!! Thats why gift certificates are best for serious gamers~ Love you, Joey"
3,"Yeah, so ?","I'll keep it short:All the fuzz aside, I still prefer the original Halo. H3 is not a bad game by any stretch, but the wow factor just wasn't there. Too much hype and over-commercializing (Halo Cereal?) has hurt the myth of Master Chief. Halo 3 is a classic example of what happens when all it's really about anymore is the profit. You can have fun with this, but it's not world-shattering.HT"
3,It's ok.,If your getting it make sure you have Live because the single player game is not all that exciting for replay value.
5,"Oooh, Halo 3 That! Review News.","Halo is an incredible franchise, but it does lack somewhat in the aspect of humor. There are funny moments, but not a single mention of Chinese kids, bees having heart attacks, or Twiggy's dance club. Karl Pilkington, please come back to podcasting."
3,"Dissapointed, more of the same","I'm really dissapointed, the game improve on graphics and weapons, vehicles, artifacts, but playability is the same, there is no improvement or further sofistication from previous versions rather than graphics. Campaign is really fun (finish the fight!). But live, after playing a lot of live in Halo 2, becomes really boring, and more boring yet if you compare it with the Gears of War live experience, which in my opinion is way ahead of Halo 3 in terms of playability."
5,one of the best 360 games,to start off i'd like to say one thing about this game AWESOME graphics look much better and so does everything else! but eventually you will get board of playing this game but one bad part is odst came out with something they should've put in from minute one firefight. if it was in this game this would be the best game ever but for now go buy this game if you don't have enough for odst but great game in all!
2,Meh,"I guess I don't see the big deal about Halo. The story is lame, the graphics are mediocre... I bought this game because a friend is obsessed with it but I regret buying it."
3,NOT WORTH THE HYPE!!!,"I had a 2 page review written but decided to sum it up.Graphics:Not impressed!!! WTF Bungie! The trees look like [...]!!!!did you even touch them?Level design: LAME! Only one I like is the Zanzibar rendition. Maybe with time they will grow on me but I kinda doubt it.Campaign: same as halo 2, its nothing but practice for multiplayer! Dont get anrgy if your one of those that acctually cares about the story! Its just boring! Every halo has the same damn enemies and you do the same [...] over and over and over!All in all Im not impressed. Bungie you really let me down on this one!! you better make it up with new, better levels in content download!! And don't you dare charge for them! And to think... I used to love you!!!"
3,Online multiplayer is VERY limited and outdated,"First, the single player campaign is about 6-10 hours, which is fairly short.Second, its online features are lacking:Offline Modes: Competitive, Cooperative, Team OrientedOnline Modes: Competitive, Cooperative, Team OrientedNumber of Players: 1-4Split Screen Offline Players: 4Number of Online Players: 16 OnlineSo, you can play online, but no online split-screen. Second, online 16 players in one online game?! That's ridiculous.Come on guys, this game is WAY OVERRATED.If you want an awesome online multiplayer game, get Warhawk, Team Fortress, or Counter Strike. All of them support more than 30 players! And, Warhawk supports split-screen online, which means you can have 4 people playing in your house split-screen on the same TV while you all play against up to 28 other players online!Compared to these multiplayer games, Halo 3 SUCKS."
2,Overhyped and Overrated,"I played this game in the store on base for about an hour or so...what a letdown. I knew there was no-way it could live up to the hype, but this game is bland, boring and the graphix could be found on a PS2. The gunz feel like you are shooting a BB gun. Save your $$$ for COD4."
1,Vile excrement,"This just doesn't hold up. Were it not for Pete Doherty's very public problems, this forgettable music would be easily forgotten. With objective listens, there just isn't anything of quality in this music. Some might find a sense of urgency or danger, but I just hear a desperate junkie not composing, playing, or producing very well. I'm sad both for him and for the lemmings that play along with this hype-driven charade."
5,Love Vince gill,This oIs one great cd. It has it all. The music is great and the artist's are all really great.
4,Check them out!!,Love it but their newer one called Time Jumpers (released 2012) with Vince Gill is amazing. I saw them at Hardly Strickly Bluegrass in San Francisco this fall and I was an instant fan. Enjoy!
3,Poster quality,The shipping speed was really fast and no major problems. The price was great but the actual quality of the picture wasn't as professional as I thought it would be but is still a great looking poster just abut less than expected
3,Not Really what I wanted,Too abstract a picture of times square. Would have preferred a more life like picture.Should have looks closer at the advertisement detail.
1,Sent the wrong poster!,I received a different poster from the one shown. The colors were absolutely dull and the picture quality was pixilated. I could have taken the same picture with my iPhone and have a better quality picture.
4,not a bad book.,"The book is a little better then some of the recently published buffy books, in the young adult serious. It could have been a little better, and it seemed to end a little to fast but over all, it was an enjoyable read."
4,It was okay,This book was a pretty good book and it is worth reading. There is defiently some serious drama with Andy and everything. The whole Jessica/Jade/Jeremy triangle is really getting old. That is why I gave it four stars.
2,Sucky.,"This book really bit the big one. Most of the books in the series kinda dragged, but i swear, the liz coner thing is boring, i liked it better when he was just admitting to himself that he needed her. AS for andy, if i had a friend that told me that, i would be at his side 24/7. I'm glad that they are bringing back melissa and will. i want lila to try to get jess's friendship back. i hope the next book is better."
3,NOT ONE OF THE BEST!,"This book was not one of the best in the whole series. First of all, the book started out really slow and the whole Conner thing is really getting on my nerves. Liz should stop being in denial about Conner and she really needs to dump him and find someone else. How many times has he hurt her? And Jade needs to decide what guy she wants. She is the immature one right now NOT Jessica. Jessica was right for telling Jeremy everything but I think he had no right to blow up at her! Jade was the one who cheated *This time.* And why is everyone just pushing aside the whole Andy-gay thing. Seems as though if this where real life then people would be talking about it. Even though this book was not that good, I can't wait to read the next one. I am sure it will be a good one!"
3,Disappointed!,Having read Wendy Cope's poem 'He Tells Her' I was a little dissappointed in this book of her poems.They are good but some are very similiar in nature.I enjoy modern poetry and recommend Judith Viorst also a modern poet.
3,Very Uneven-Not Enough Blues,"I love the Blues and Buddy Guy, but not every song on here is a gem or even the blues.My favorite song on here is the Tracy Chapman ""Ain't No Sunshine"" song, but it isn't exactly the blues.The blues numbers I like are ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" and ""Cut You Loose"", but even those are not his best."
5,5 stars without even hearing it,"Sorry David but I give this 5 stars and I haven't even had a chance to go buy it yet. Simply the greatest living guitarist and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Be thankful the man is still making music. I'm sure the disc is full of great solos. Think about it for a minute - can you even comprehend how great and influential this guitar player is? For ****'s sake, Jimi Hendrix followed him around and tape recorded him to study/copy. Please."
2,Let Down,"The anticipation of Task Force Dagger was quite high after playing Land Warrior mulitple times. Unfortunatley within minutes of my first mission I felt as though something was either wrong with me or the game. Why were the hostiles ""Sitting Ducks"" Where was the combat? Why did every barrack and building apprear to be the same as the last? Where was the dramatic music? Where was the need of urgency in the voices of my team? Where was my team? It wasn't me. It was the game."
2,watch out!,"Watch out if your on a high end machine. I built a high end machine with 3.06ghz 2gigs of Ram on a ATI 9700 Pro using windows XP PRO, and I got a virtual memory error but only with this game. All my other games work awesome, Wolfenstien, medal of honor, battlefield 1942, unreal 2, UT2003,and soldier of fortune2 to name a few. So its definatly not the machine, it runs all of them at the highest settings like a dream except this one. This is just a word of warning, oh yea this game ran good on my old system p3 550 with XP home on it. So just keep that in mind. I hope Black Hawk down runs good. It better with this much power............................."
1,horribible,"STEAR CLEAR DELTA FORCE AHEAD TASK FORCE DAGGER AHEAD!! This game is horrible don't waste your money,waste your money and realize your mistakes"
5,An early loss,An awesome voice that seemingly got better with age. Durcal was the definition of awe! She passed away in her home land of Spain but left a legacy to be cherished by lovers of true vocal talent. This CD has extra bonus videos but there's a more expansive DVD that was simultaneously released. Get these gems!
5,LOVE THESE,This is the second time I've bought these replacement razors. Loved the first time. BEST bang for your buck out there. Get rid of all my hard callouses with one side. Arrived in two days to boot.
5,great!,I looked for these in CVS and RiteAid and couldn't find them. So happy I found them here- for very cheap!
5,Very good buy!,"I paid twice as much for a pack of these at a local store, so very happy with my purchase!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased this for my daughter, she thought it was ok, I thought it looked ""beachy"". I suppose it would be ok for a night time summer beach outing, but other than that, it seems a little cheap. I returned it.The seller has a lot of rules for returning items so beware. We followed all the rules carefully and received a full refund."
4,ladies and gentlemen the wilco experience,"I can't really give this album a full review. I am only writing this as a fan who has seen the band live and have to say that the act is excellent. Wilco is a special act because it is an intimate one. They suck you into their little world of beauty and cross-musical brilliance. They require an attentive audience, but one that enjoys the music as well. The only drawback is for someone who has not seen the band and only has a CD to fall back on. Otherwise, something like this is a great reminder of how fun rock and roll can be. The real thing is more like five stars."
4,Need a 48th opinion?,"I need there to be at least 48 reviews of this album so that I can sleep at night. That is all. Oh, and Wilco stirs an emotion within me similar to that of unicorn giggles."
2,Upsetting,"I love Wilco. I was at one of the shows where this was taped. My problem is with the choices of songs. How about Passenger Side? Far, Far Away? Kingpin?The problem with this CD is my problem with the show I saw. Too much from the last two discs. How about some of these great older songs. This is why Wilco has become so frustrating. They have this great catalog, but seem to chose to play the same few songs live over and over. I am getting tired of YHF live.They should have taped and released their September 2003 show from the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago. That set list was a great mix of all their albums.Why don't they play Box Full Of Letters anymore!!??"
2,"A Great Band, but Not their Greatest Tunes","Wilco is great band who has produced some excellent albums over the past years. Their best works, ""Being There"" and ""Summerteeth"" saw a cutting edge band moving away from lead man Jeff Tweedy's Uncle Tupelo twang past, and findnig his own sound with the assistance of a great supporting cast of equals. ""Kicking Television"" covers ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" and ""A Ghost is Born"" almost exclusively. While ""Foxtrot"" won a grammy, ""A Ghost is Born"" was a major disappointment.If you like earlier Wilco, pick up a bootleg from the Summerteeth tour and pass on this one."
3,"Works OK, but too small for me","Knee pillow is OK for a small person, but too small for me. The velcro wraparound strap was long enough, but a little stiff and scratchy. The strap is also slippery, so the small pillow didn't stay in place unless I balanced one knee directly on top of the other.Product matches picture, but just didn't work out for me."
5,The best polish bar none!,I am a professional musician and I would not use any other polish on my instruments. Guardsman is the best polish bar none and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a superior furniture polish.
5,Announcement of prize awarded to Atlas...,"Atlas of the Irish Rural Landscape has been chosen by the American Conference for Irish Studies as the best book in History/Social Sciences for 1998. Lucy McDiarmid, President, American Conference for Irish Studies"
3,Good but something was missing...,"After reading Skye#1, which I loved so much, I couldn't wait to read the ongoing adventures of Skye and her family. I thought the plotline was not as strong as the first book. Plus I was really disappointed with the efforts that Skye went through to find Niall and then to come up short at the end. Plus my preference was for Skye to find true happiness with Niall. One moment she's declaring him her ""last love"" and in a heartbeat she realizes that she's deeply in love with Adam. I like Adam but there was just something missing for me in his chemistry w/ Skye. I didn't fall in love with him as I did with Khalid, Geoffrey + Niall. It could be his constant endearment to her as ""little girl"" that was annoying.Overall the book was good but not as great as Skye#1. The first book was richer in character development and storyline. Still for those who are curious about the ongoing drama with Skye O'Malley, this book is adequate enough."
2,Poor Skye,All I can say is give poor Skye a break. It cannot be a real romance novel when half of the book is rape and death. I cried more during this book than I ever had before. And how many husbands can one woman have and how much pain can she suffer through? Just let her be happy
5,Definitely worth a try .. .,"I've been taking the supplements recommended in this book, and it's really made a difference in my energy level. I no longer doze off in the afternoon. Instead, I go out and take a walk! Even though the Carnitine/CO-Q10 approach probably won't work for everybody, it certainly is worth a try if you're suffering from persistent fatigue."
2,Started reading with energy... but ended very tired,"The book became VERY repetitive, and fairly technical. All you need to know is in one chapter."
1,Not good,"When I got the Sandisk memory stick it did not work and I returned it. The replacement worked for a few days and then it stopped as well. Secondly, the cover was lost in 2 days because it is so easy to pull off. I was most disappointed in this.The best thing about it is it's size but the size cannot compensate for its non-functionality. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Very unreliable,"I bought my first micro cruzer 6 months ago. It worked well until the fourth month. It just stopped working one day. I sent it back to Sandisk for another one. Their customer service is great. They sent me a brand new one immediately. I opened up the new one and after about four uses, it stopped working!! I just sent back my second micro cruzer to Sanisk. They are going to send me another new one very soon. At this point, I have lost all confidence in this product, so I may just try to give this new one away with a warning and buy thumb drive that is made from a different company"
4,Sandisk Cruzer Micro,"Impressively small, for a decent price. Fast transfer speeds over USB 2, and fine over USB 1.1 (0.5Mb/sec). Functions over an unpowered USB hub as well. Works well under MacOS X. Would have given it 5 stars, except that IBM PC does not eject it under Windows 2000. No data corruption, but computer gives annoying improper media removal message."
5,Suzzy Soars!,"Suzzy Roche (of the Roche sisters) is a complete treat. This is some of the most wonderful ""This is what it's like to be a human being"" music that I've ever heard, and straight from the heart's center. Having seen the Roches many times in concert it's terrific to know that Suzzy is also doing fine on her own. Kudos!"
2,The world was waiting for a great bio of Anna May ...,"... and it still is. This book gets all of the facts but none of the story. It's disappointing most of all for what it could have been, given the huge amount of time the author obviously spent researching his subject."
2,Advice: Eat Greetings Cards,"If you have ever eaten a 12 pack of greetings cards, perhaps Hallmark, you will have some idea about these so-called ""crackers"", and that term is used in its broadest and loosest sense. That said, it boggles the mind why anyone would buy a whole 12 packs of these things.These crackers are about the only ones that I know of that add absolutely nothing to any topping whatsoever. Do yourself a favour: eat the cheese alone. It will actually feel and taste better without the water cracker to drag it down. This would be like adding rice pudding to Movenpick ice cream. Or having a nice glass of Moet & Chandon with a McDonalds Happy Meal.If you really need crackers, actually buy real ones. Not cardboard immitations like this."
4,Good with cheese,"Water crackers do not have much flavor of their own, so you may be disappointed if you expect them to be rich and flavorful. These are good with cheese and wine.Arnott's water crackers are a little below Carr's in quality, but are still very good and I would buy them again."
3,All that Glitters is Shahid Kapur,"Guys don't come much cuter than Shahid Kapur and he sure can bust a move, but when you come down to it that's all this film really has going for it. The screenplay combines two stories that are cliches in both Hollywood and Bollywood 1)that of the suffering actor trying to make it big and 2)the teacher who turns a class of misfits into a winning team. The film doesn't do much with the second plotline at all. But in all fairness it does milk the melodrama in our long suffering hero's life for all it's worth by employing great swells of music as life hits him with one sucker punch after another. Will he ever realise his dream and become a star? Are you kidding me? This is Bollywood. CHANCE PE DANCE wasn't bad for a one time viewing but it's nothing special, still I will be checking out some more of Kapur's films. The kid's got talent. And looks. Did I mention the looks?"
5,Great Service,My CD was just as described and it arrived faster than I thought it would. Definitely do business with them.
4,Screw-on Tweeter with 30 Oz. Magnet,"This is a good Tweeter for the price, out of 10 I had one bad one. Amazonreplaced the bad one at no cost. This is not a screaming high tweeter, more of a mid high."
5,What to Do When the Doctor Says t' Diabetes,"This was the most insightful and informational and inspirational book on Diabetes. Having a mother with type 2 diabetes, I am always searching for new information and guidance. Healthly eating, exercise, and mental strength -- thank you! And knowing the facts - so important. This book truly guided me to help my Mom and prevent me (hopefully) from getting this disease. Thank you Ms. Yu."
4,Honest survey of the shift from republican tradition,"Perhaps overwhelming for the beginner, but for those informed about the evolution of the IRA and its movement away from the Green Book and the armalite to the British and Irish parliaments, Moloney offers corrective and sobering detail of the Adams and McGuinness-led coterie and their domination of the present Provos in both the IRA and Sinn Fein...Moloney has painstakingly assembled his evidence after long years spent bending the ear of many a hard man. As a native of Belfast and a skilled journalist, he writes without the verve of J. Bowyer Bell or the swagger of Tim Pat Coogan, but his own version of IRA history fills in details previously unreported by mainstream authors or known by the public crucial to a nuanced understanding of how the Provo IRA via SF came to be the acceptable face of republicanism today."
5,Can't wait to try this brands other varieties.,"Wonderful fragrance, luxurious feel. I had never tried this company's soaps before this purchase but I will definitely be trying a variety of scents after this experience. I don't even know what verbena is but it's very nice!"
3,contemporary greek myth,"I liked this book because it incorporated Greek myths and recipes with the story. It was a nice blending of food, tradition, culture and the modern story. The parallels between Greek characters and the characters in the book was smart and sweet. The author was clever and kept most of the book intriguing with eclectic characters. The only problem with the book was the weak ""love"" relationship. The unhealthy relationship was annoying to me because I had a higher esteem for the protagonistthan she did for herself. I read it for my Ethnic-Amn book group the Salsa Book Group. Part of the development of the character was coming to terms with her Greek heritage and growing from running away from her past to embracing it."
2,Old Style Hack-and-Slash /w disconnected plots?,"This adventure is quite bland in the begining and doesn't get much better. It consists of 5 different parts, but the first two parts don't really go along with the rest of the module. This isn't too terrible as the adventures can be played separately if you need something to get started up fast or just want give some characters some experience."
1,A good book for yuppie moms w/ babies& toddlers,"This is a good book if you have a toddler or younger child.and also it is good if you have NO experience being frugal and have never heard of discounts, etc...I suspect the author is married to a guy with a good job and he makes a lot more money than my husband does, I also suspect that they own a nice home, and aren't struggling to come up with a downpayment on a home.Its easy to be a stay at home mom when Dad earns a lot.maybe her idea of cutting back means on the dinner parties and expensive jewelrya good book for the yuppie set.I really read this book, unlike the authors friends who posted here and clogged up the true review space with false praise"
3,Basic Book for Beginners,"How to Raise a Family on Less Than Two Incomes is a good, basic guide for those who have thought about taking this route but haven't really looked into it yet. Many of the areas that the author explores -- such as understanding your monthly expenses, cutting child care and grocery costs, saving for your future -- are things you'll find in many of the personal finance and frugal books out there, so if you have read more than a few on the subject there won't be much new here. But the author has a nice clean writing style, and does a very good job with the information she presents. So I would heartily recommend it for a beginner, less so for an experienced frugal person. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website."
5,My favorite Book,"I love this book. I read it three times and I don't like reading books over. The plot is very unique. The book is fast-paced. The characters are well done. Each having original personalities.Gold-Eye, the main character, guides the story with his misfortunes and innocence. I could read this book a hundred times and still be mistified by it. I highly recommend this book,even if you do not enjoy science fiction. Garth Nix is one of my favorite author's and this is one of the reasons why."
4,Shade's Children is a Fantastic book!,"I could go on and on about this wonderful book....it is scary and great all at once. Yes, when I saw the Matrix, I kept thinking, this is like Shade's Children! But I do believe that the book was written first. I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish it. I also recommend Sabriel, it is even better! I would really recommend that you read Shade's children, it will give you a frightning look at the human mind and what we will do to survive. It is, all in all, a chilling but beautiful book."
4,Shade's Children was a great book,"Garth Nix's Shade's Children was a very well written book. I liked the interviews and self evalutaions and such that came from Shade at the end of every chapter. They helped give more information and it was just a cool way to write a book. The action was basically nonstop and the book moved along really quickly. I couldn't put it down and finished it inside of 4 days. I like futuristic/Sci-fi type novels and fantasy novels a lot and this book was sort of a mix between the two. The monsters, swords, and the childrens' almost magical ""change talents"" made it sort of a fantasy. But all of the technology, and ""overlords"", and Shade himself made it very Sci-fi. I think if you like either fantasy or Sci-fi you will like this book."
3,"Shades of John Christopher, with less than usual Nix quality","Having read Garth Nix's superb book Sabriel, I picked up this book with interest. However, the story, while thrilling and packing an adrenaline punch, failed to make me care about the characters. Also, I have to say that the basic premise of Shade's Children is rather like that of John Christopher's Tripods Trilogy. Not that I particularly cared for that series, either, but I feel bad for this talented and usually inventive author, that he had to fall back on such hackneyed plotlines."
3,Interesting read,"This is a pretty good example of children's/young adult fiction. There is some subject matter that parents might wish to discuss with younger readers (e.g., slaughter of humans as if they were livestock, the breeding custom called ""the lottery""). I just happened to read this book at the same time as Orson Scott Card's *Ender's Game* and uncovered a great number of parallels between the two plots and underlying messages. Personally, I preferred *Ender's Game,* but I feel *Shade's Children* is more appropriate for young science fiction fans, as it is much less violent.I recommend this book for 10-to-15-year-olds, especially if they love science fiction, but also if they just love an entertaining read."
1,Pornography,"I think that this book is ill suited for even adults with Garth Nix's sick mind. Im probably younger than the person who is reading this and I found at least 5 things that had to do with sex, 1 briefly describing it. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE"
1,Horrible!,"It is a pointless book that did not make very much sense set in an inbelieveable, underdeveloped world. The plot did not really tell you about why certain things happen, all the characters did was run from place to place."
5,"Awesome DVD, sunsets breathtaking","Awesome DVD, sunsets breathtaking, magnificent vistas, extremely relaxing A+++ Just like being on the beach, and very serene... Now, I've got a dose of California until I go back again! Love the DVD!! Thanks."
5,It is a wonderful nature video- peaceful and beautiful.,I've watched it 10-12 times! It's very very relaxing to watch and listen to... with just the sounds of ocean waves lapping on the beach without any music. It sure works for me. I've bought several copies including California Dreams for my friends as gifts. I love it! It's great stress relief especially during the holidays.
4,A beautiful stimulating look at California's coast.,"After watching Waves, I feel as though I had just returned from the coast. As a freelance photographer, I love to watch the ocean beauty and the seagulls at sunset. This video captures the ocean's timeless beauty for all of us to enjoy when we want- natural sounds and all. It's truly spiritual. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
4,An Epic Experience,"This cd by Cromwell is amazing except for one thing--the vocals. You'll hear great ""Asia-like"" guitar work from Thor Stone and incredible keyboards. The keyboard work is at times ""atmospheric"" and complements Thor's guitar work. At other times it takes on more of a lead role. The lyrics are interesting hinting at epic themes. Now back to the vocals. I have no idea why the band chose a female vocalist unless it's because she may be the brother of the keyboardist (same last names--Taeffener). Anyway, the vocals perhaps should have been from a male (no sexism intended). With an album of this sort the female vocals felt out of place. Additionally, the vocals are actually poor for the first vocal track. Admittedly, the vocals improve progressively throughout the cd. Same for the keys. They just get better and more complex throughout the cd. Bottom line, if you love keyboards and good guitar work this is a fine progressive cd. Maybe the vocals will grow on you."
4,Great watch for this price.,Great watch for the price. Very useful functions for daily use: 1. 24 hour count-down timer. 2. Pre-set time alarm 3. Hourly alarm. 3. 100M WR.The only cons are: 1. the window material is plastic and is very easy to have sratches. 2. the digits is a little unclear when backlight is on at night.
3,It's Okay,"Based on my use, soap and water would have done the same thing. Save your money and just use soap and water."
4,makes a great gift.,Got this for my daughter-in-law because she is a health conscious vegitarian unlike her father-in-law. Beautiful t-shirt and a great gift for the vegie in your life.
3,Very Mellow,"This is a very Beatle Sounding record. Of course it's not the talented Beatles, so therefore it is missing a huge something. If you're looking to relax and just chill out this is a great album to put on if you want to unwind. It's not a party piece at all, but that still does not take away from the quality of this record."
2,Christmas Present,"The book was received on time as ordered very close to Christmas for my nephew. However, the book itself was of poor quality; the binding was defective thus the pages were not aligned as should have been."
1,Have not received package.,I cannot rate this product since I have not received it. I put in the order online. I received a confirmation e-mail and an expected arrival date. The arrival date has come and gone. I e-mailed the owner over a week ago. I have no reply yet. I would like to know where my package is and when I can expect it but so far no one seems to care to contact me to tell me.
1,Got wrong product twice when ordering this from 2 different companies,"We ordered this twice from 2 different companies, and each time received 1 4GB flash drive. If you order this expecting 20 TDK LTO backup tapes, do not be surprised if instead you get a 4GB flash drive in the mail!"
4,beautiful,Lovely music to accompany a lovely book and series. Fun to listen to while reading the books.
5,Great info!,"This book tells you in a very clear way what happens to your body during labor and delivery. I had a great labor and delivery (with an epidural!) and had no intentions of doing it ""the Bradley way"", but found the book to be extremely helpful in lessening my fears of childbirth. The only problem I had was that the first 50 pages of the book were jumbled so I had to hunt for each page to finish the chapters."
4,Bradley instead of Lamaze?,"For women interested in birthing without medication and with minimal hospital intervention, this book is a keystone. Even if you decide to have an epidural or need other medical interventions, it holds super important information about breathing and about how truly valuable a husband/partner/coach is to having a positive birthing experience. We just had our third child. For the first, I had a c-section; for the second, I had a vaginal delivery along with an epidural; and for this new baby, I did it naturally without any meds or anything. It wasn't easy, but we felt prepared. The book is a little dated, but that wasn't a distraction from the truly valuable information. We actually combined reading this book on our own with a refresher birthing class that was more Lamaze-centered."
5,Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way,"I bought this book based on the reviews of others and they were RIGHT! I couldn't have done it without the knowledge provided in this book. YES! I did it...drug free 36 hours of labor! I did give birth in a hospital that wanted to push thier drugs on me however, with the knowledge and support provided in this book (and of course the support of my husband) WE did it! The nurses said that it was EXTREMELY rare for anyone to do this (I feel it's because the doctors treat pregnancy as a problem rather than the most natural thing a woman could go through). Next time I will give birth at home. Get this Book! You can do it!"
2,"Really out of date, even if this was still 1996","Details about hospital practices and medications are out of date even by 1996 standards. A whole chapter on the dangers of Bendectin for nausea? That drug was taken off the market in 1983 by the manufacturer. What exactly was updated? The cover art?Why can't there be a book that teaches natural childbirth techniques without the tinfoil hat, anti-medical (and not even remotely accurate anymore) hysteria?"
5,Loved It,"Such a fantastic book! The best one I've read on pregnancy. It is well organized, practical and shows good pictures of exactly how to do what it's describing. The author clearly understands the physiology of labor and delivery. You will come away with so much practical knowledge. Enjoy."
5,Very helpful and informative book!,"While I have not yet had my daughter, I am very confident in the things this book teaches. I feel very ready and comfortable with the methods taught in this book. I highly recommend it if you are wanting to do a completely un-medicated birth."
4,Great book.,This is very informative. Very easy to read. Good pictures and explainations. A must for those wishing to do a natural birth.
3,Update Please,"Other than the method itself, this book is really outdated. So much has changed in the healthcare world since 1987, there are standards in care that every hospital must abide by. As far as the method....it seems to be really helpful, I will try and use this method at my up and coming childbirth. I had wished there were more instruction on the exercises, rather than just relying on pictures."
5,Excellent Book,"Very good pictures and exercises throughout the book. Empowers your partner to really get involved and help with the birthing process in a much deeper way. Wonderful book.The best (and only, in my honest opinion) book that you should read is Ina May's Guide to Childbirth. Talk about empowering! I believe every human should read this book. Ina May is my personal hero.Ina May's Guide to Childbirth"
2,"Outdated, Defensive","I was uncomfortable that the first two chapters talk about why this method is so superior to everything else on the planet. I wouldn't have bought the book if I didn't hope so myself, but it seemed odd to be that defensive. It was a little childish. I skipped those chapters for the most part.It's also a little hard to take this book seriously when all of the images are clearly from 1970. I know that not much has changed as far as the method goes over the years, but it would have been nice to know that it was modern. For the most part it was very un-helpful, and I walked away feeling pretty un-informed on what the ""Method"" really is? Oh well, I'll try another book."
3,Book by Mr. Bradley much better.,"I read this pretty close to delivering my first and by that time I was just DONE with naked pics of other people. There are A LOT, as noted in other reviews.I am a very big fan ofHusband-Coached Childbirth (Fifth Edition): The Bradley Method of Natural Childbirthwhich is loaded with practical information for moms & dads.There is nothing special in this book that you don't get in other natural-birth books."
4,Useful book but very old school,"I ordered this book after buying Husband Coached childbirth and its good to have both books. There is a lot of great information in this book, I dont really understand the need for all the nude pictures. Its not as up to date as I would like but still very useful. I'm glad I bought this book and highly recommend it."
3,Buy it only if you're taking the Bradley classes,"This book is the manual for the Bradley brand of childbirth classes. I took the classes and learned the most from my teacher, the book is more of a supplemental reference. Really, if you're serious about trying natural childbirth, invest in the classes with a really good teacher. Don't just buy this book and try it on your own. Trust me, I was able to deliver without any pain medication but it was VERY.....intense! You'll need the classroom, the exercises and the nutrition. Good luck!"
5,Tony is a very fine singer,"I've seen Tony live a few times and enjoyed the experiences. This CD wonderfully conveys his voice, stylings and personality. Both he and this CD are winners."
2,Not for someone who knows no Farsi at all,"I bought this for my husband who doesn't speak any Farsi. The CD goes too fast, and even the start is too advanced for a beginner that he can't really follow and repeat and learn. He didn't use it more than a couple of times, because it was not easy to follow."
4,"Great story, a little bogged down.","Although I really liked this book, there were times when there was so much history presented that I got a little bored. Perhaps that's because I just finished reading the very same history in a textbook and found the retelling unnecessary. However, for those who are unfamiliar with the historical setting, Lund's presentation is probably a good idea.Even though the writing is really good, I quit reading after book four because it just seemed like I was rereading information that I already knew. For me, the story was too slow in comparison with the lengthy historical narrative.Good story, good writing. I would recommend this series."
4,So?,So who is Stanley Bing in so-called real life? I know that he works for Sumner Redstone and Mel Carmizon--not spelled right. Someone must know his name.
2,Missed opportunity,"This was a sad attempt to seriously consider the ethical implications of activing in the way Ol' Mach suggests in his classic: The Prince. It would have been very interesting to see those concepts actually applied to the business world (and not veiled in humor as Mr. ""Bing"" (Chandler?) spits it.) The Prince is misunderstood and that ignorance is used to perpetuate more ignorance on behalf of the public who don't understand and authors like Mr. ""Bing"" who feed more misunderstanding into the mainstream. Way to go, you had a great idea, but blew it. Hmm... maybe I'll write that book.... =D"
1,Koak Easy Share N137 Camera Dock,"Although the model number, N137, matches the model number on the camera dock that I originally purhased with my camera, the one I ordered from Amazon does not work with my camera. The connection on the docking station does not align with the connection in the camera. Therefore, the camera dock I received through amazon.com is totally useless to me. A total waste of my money."
1,FOR LAZY PEOPLE!,I have a bought a kodak camera with this dock because I didnt do enough research.If you bought it... return it and get a memory card.The only good thing about the dock is that it makes it look good....My advise is dont buy it....
5,Uma das melhores interpretaes,"Este CD reúne uma das melhores interpretaes do Vocalize de Rachmaninoff por Anna Moffo. Sem o aparato das mixagens eletrnicas de hoje, podemos ouvir uma voz pura, cristalina, e de um gosto musical irreprensível. Acompanha o CD duas outras magníficas interpretaes desse compositor russo. Imperdível para fs do compositor."
5,Records to cd with ease,"A great buy for the money. Unless the record is in awful condition, a lot of sound problem issues are dealt with well in the mp3 process. Gracenote, which comes with the product download, does a good job of locating old albums and tracks. The program download was easy, and I will start on my old cassettes soon on a similar device."
1,Numark=AWFUL,This product came without the belt. I have repeatedy tried to contact Numark and they have yet to respond. The product does not work and the company is the worst company I have ever purchased anything from.I am beyond disappointed!
3,usb turntable.,I am not very mechanically inclined and it would have been better if it had been assembled. It is together now and is fine. The price is reasonable and does what it is advertised to be doing. I would recommend it to others.
5,Works very nicely ...,"There's no difficulty setting this unit up -- just pay attention to the directions and don't throw the foam before you're finished. (There's a couple of items tucked into slots in the foam blocks that you don't notice until, ""Where's the blasted cartridge?"") The enclosed instructions on resetting your pc sound card could be improved. (It's all there, just cumbersome.)I started by converting an ancient 45rpm of the Commodores. No problem, but you'll have to play with the ""noise reduction"" a bit -- less is more! Then I converted a 2-disc LP opera, pressed in 1978. Again, no problems at all. Just follow the hint(s) in the Audacity instructions. The Click-&-Pop Removal Effect worked very well!This is a very worthwhile piece of equipment, very nice indeed!"
3,Needs additional support,"As stated in other reviews, the product matches only 1 of the 2 photos, the one showing the box. Setting up was easy enough but even with the bases filled with water, they weren't stable enough. We had to purchase sand bags to lay over the base to keep them from being knocked over whenever a ball went into the net. Other than that, the product suits its purpose, particularly for the price."
3,okay,"The space is too small to see the dominioes clearly. I have to put my small print glasses on to play. Also, the light does not illuminate like I had hoped it would.Overall, I am an avid domino player and this will do in a pinch."
2,Piano Exercise,"This book was recommended by my daughter's piano teacher, so I bought it. Although the exercises are okay, but they were not fun. Instead it became a turn off for my daughter. Don't buy this book if your kids are doing well with the piano and are having fun playing the Piano. This book is like sending an A-Student into remedial lessons or summer school. Instead get some songbooks or sheet music which they like to sing and play. Make Piano lessons fun... not a chore."
2,Illegible,"Looked pretty good on-line. Alas, the face is soooooo messy, busy and ubergechachkied that the eye was sent scurrying about: back and forth between analog and digital displays. Avoid this model. Ended up returning it, and buying a (much more expensive) G-Shock model which is satisfactory."
4,Fun to read,"Easy to read, great to just get my mind off of things. Great series. Can't wait for more!"
2,Not for me,This just didnt work for me. I have tried guided meditations from this author and have loved them. Maybe it will be good for someone else
3,good enough,a great 80^s band I've got 'em since drivin` hard;the DVD is a flash back and that's all........... a flash back
3,still mulling,"i've read all the negative reviews. I agree there is something missing when you look at the world from just a limited economic and selfish perspective. His former business partner George Soros hit on an idea of ""reflexivity"". While mocked, I would agree that profiting from the blood on the streets lacks compassion. Jim Rogers provides astute insight to how countries are being run. I would have preferred some coments on the degredation of the environment as well as devaluing the currency.Worth the price I paid for the book. An enjoyable read."
5,Great adventure & reality book,"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to get a tangible feel for the many cultures around the world and how things operate from a ground level perspective. Mr. Rogers is a keen and insightful observer and relates his adventures with humor, humbleness, and inspiration."
1,Investment advice or travel diary? Probably nothing.,"The whole idea of someone visiting hundred some countries and comparing the scope for investment in each of them lacks credibility. The book is full of author's own (and mostly incorrect) conclusions about issues which are deep and puzzle even the experts. Most of the book's focus is on the local food and entertainment rather than investment climate. A look at the author's conclusions seems that Mr. Rogers left for this trip with a pre-set bias in his mind.If you like to read personal travel diaries, this book will be an average one (not good). If you are looking for investment advice, please avoid it. Go and find yourself. But trust me its impossible to gauge countries and economies in 10 days."
1,Book synopsis: arrogant airhead makes lightweight travelogue,"This guy is not only arrogant and provincial, but has about as much depth as a soap dish. At least he's consisent: I've had the misfortune to observe that his other writing is also not worth spending time on."
1,disappointed,I bought one for my 11yr old son and we were both disappointed. It is not skin tight it is very loose.
4,game is very fun for little ones,"The game cd goes great with the keyboard! My daughter loves to play it. Love the fact you can choose levels by Age.. fun game, interesting characters. Keeps my 2 year old interested for short bursts, several times a day."
1,out of date. do NOT buy dated material from this vender,product arrived just as expected. Only problem was the hp ink was out of date (expired).By the time i realized it it was to late to return the item. a complete waste -- had to throw it away...After spending a hour on the phone with hp Help.They explained the only fix was to get a cartridge that was NOT out of date.Do not buy dated material from this vender!!
3,Broken when arrived,"We recieved this item broken, but one was replaced quickly by amazon. The green button was broken, so you couldnt play a few of the games. But other than that, my daughter loves it.."
1,"This ""cube"" does not turn...how stupid","I can't believe that I purchased this and it does not turn. I paid double the price of the original turning Rubik's Cube, but it doesn't turn. For double the price, why can't it both play games and turn? I am returning this as the package should say that it doesn't turn."
1,IS NOT A RUBIKS CUBE,"It has nothing of Revolution is more like ""Regresion"". Is not educational,nor fun, creative or nothing. Stay away from this so called toy.Is a big piece of junk. Not fun at all and has nothing to do with Rubiks cube, it just seems like. I couldn't give it zero stars, I wish I could.It doesn't turn or rotate, it lasted the time it took me to smash it on the floor, because the place I got it, once opened it can not be returned. I've been ROBBED. Don't throw away your money with this junk."
1,failed design,"I purchased one, it quit working properly within a week. So I went and had it replaced. The second one quit working properly very quickly also. Game would be fun if it were durable. And mind you we are not hard on games, and it was mostly me, an adult who knows how to treat her games, that played this.Very disappointed that it was designed to fail."
4,It was pretty good,"Nothing is Forever was a great book. I don't want to give anything away so I can't say much, but this book is full of suprises. I wish that they had included more about Connor and Liz."
4,Awesome descriptions!,Bruce Coville uses wonderful adjectives to describe his characters in this fun and suspense filled book.
2,Thinking for a Change - forget the CD,"I ordered Thinking for a Change on CD - don't bother. If anything get the book. There are numerous exercises that are tedious to do without the text written in front of you. The book/audio is filled with ""here are 5 things you need to do to accomplish X"" and then it lists out all 5, for example. Those are lost unless you write all of it down. I would imagine the book may be good as a reference book, but it is painful to listen to, and probably to read cover to cover."
2,Maybe just for those in business..,"I read this book at the recommendation of a coworker. I was very disappointed because I expected it to be more insightful. I didn't feel at all enlightened as the suggestions he had about thinking were common sense. The author mostly referred to successful business people that he met and how their thinking helped them in climbing up the ladder, but those examples don't really apply to the rest of the population that is not working in a business environment.I would not recommend this book."
4,Great Book,"One of the best books I have read in a while. Though I am not completely sold on the style, the content makes this one a winner.Thinking for a Change concisely presents the ""Thinking Skills"" required for successful living. It also draws richly on experiences and stories to buttress the importance of skilled thinking.I find this book practical, readable and relevant for daily activities and special project tasks. The take-homes from this book are numerous, but if I must summarize them, I would have to say that this book introduces the reader to the art of thinking at a higher level."
2,FIRST SATURDAY IN MAY,"I have quite an extensive collection of thoroughbred horse race DVD's and by far this is my least favorite of all. If your looking for black and white grainy film clips of races this is for you, otherwise I'd stick to the DVD; First Saturday in May, On The Muscle, or Barbaro a Nations Horse. The best part of this video is the box, since most fans already know the history of racing and who won what. I expected more and would return it if it were not a DVD which is non-returnable. Thank you.Barbaro - A Nation's HorseOn The Muscle: Portrait Of A Thoroughbred Racing Stable"
2,DNF,What a major disappointment. I've been following the giddy ups since the sixties and have had the privilege of seeing some of the truly greats run. The title of this video alone had me on the edge of my seat. Yet what it delivered was far far short of expectations. Blah!
4,Worth Viewing,"This isn't Biji's Bollywood. This is Deepa Mehta's New Delhi, India, during a time of transition. Fire is about burning desire-- for passion, for life, for the vision that is behind the eyes. This is not a love story, per se, but a liberation story.The story line is quite basic: in a middle class family, one husband devotes himself to his swami and vows celibacy while his younger brother, forced into a traditional wedding, continues to see his lover. Both wives tend to the restaurant and their husbands' mother, following traditional roles of subservience. Until they discover, or uncover, their passion for one another.So if the plot is not the draw, why watch this film? It gives a glimpse of the upcoming middle class (late 1990s) life--the juxtaposition of uberurban cosmopolitan life and traditional mores. It is India trying to grow into itself."
5,Status quo burning,"I actually found this to be a truly wonderful film, albeit disturbing and thought-provoking. It is not a male-bashing film, but rather a devastating critique of the dynamics involved in the traditional joint-family. The men in this film are just as trapped in their culture's expectations as the women. Fire is aptly titled, as it is emotionally searing to view. All the major characters wind up with their hearts and minds badly burned. In Hindu tradition, fire is not necessarily destructive, but transformative. The transformation in this film, however, is not necessarily what the characters expect, given their culture's parameters.While this may be a challenging film to understand for those viewers who lack basic backgound in Indian history, Hindu epics and modern urban Indian society, it is well worth watching."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I received this book today and found it to be utterly worthless. If you live your life in alphabetical order it might be for you, otherwise don't buy the book. There are no categories, no table of contents, no index. Someone at the publishing company should have enough experience if not creativity to organize this book in a meaningful way."
1,Didn't cover well,"This product didn't work at all for me. It has minimal coverage, turning brown spots greyish. Not very attractive! If you are looking for a decent product, go to the drugstore and check the Maybelline section for Dream Mousse Concealer. It does a much better job at a fraction of the cost."
4,Megaman Zero six inch figure from jazware,"Pretty good colors and close to the popular Gameboy advance game. the only drawback is the legs don't have anywere nere the articulation found in the arms..if it did then maybe this would get a 5 star rating. also the hair on the back of the figure can come off just in case it gets in the way when you are trying to use the arms. also the blades are perfect they fit very close to the video game, and consequently they fit perfectly into the hands and even when you move them around quickly they still stay in place so you can play as much as you want with the swords without worry of a flying sword to the eye. The legs are another story they bend at the knees, and twist left and right at the ankles and forward and back thats about it the one major flaw with this figure not enough articulation in the legs. other than that if you are a megaman fan or just a person looking for a cool robot rouge kind of figure then this is the figure for you."
2,sourpuss attitude undermines any satire,"Larry Kramer has never been able to forgive the cosmos for the fact that he is neither handsome nor endowed with the physique of a god, and this juvenile obsession crops up in and flaws almost everything he writes. Faggots is no exception. This satire runs afoul of Kramer's personal problem and sputters out in boring waspiness. A tiresome book."
1,expensive bra,This bra does not run true to size. small in both the cup and band. Value does not match the price.
1,"NO SUPPORT, UGHHHHHHH, ALSO DIDN'T LAST.......","I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough. I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie. This is the worst bra, and very pricey. Makes you look wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...I truly beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...Thanks, hope this helped...."
2,"Covers material, but better know programming.","The first impression is the large number of typos in the code. It seems to work well for teaching 'what' works in Perl, but totally skips any 'why' structure. It comes off as an infinite number of special exceptions. Some advice, such as in the Pattern Matching chapter is just plan wrong. Seems to have slipped out without being editted."
5,love love this book that teaches body parts to little ones,"has an adorable rhyme and you can easily read and ""act out"" the actions with your baby/toddler and giggles are sure to ensue! all my girls have loved this book"
1,:( There is no top for my sugar bowl.,There is no top for my sugar bowl. I have sent three messages. No one has not followed up with me. This is not the item i ordered and i think it is poor customer service that no one has tried to make this right. this is horrible i have ordered many items from amazon and has never been left high and dry like this.
1,Just go to Walmart!,"This is a lovely piece and the other pieces that go with it are great as well, but I definitely would recommended going out to Walmart to get it instead of buying it here. They sell a similar product that looks EXACTLY the same and is very sturdy. You'll save almost $9 since they are just over $2 there. Buying from here is just a waste of money!"
3,Imitation Marilyn--At Best,"An imitation is a copy of the real thing, and when she was youger, tbe author eked out a living, or tried to, imitating the one and only Marilyn Monroe whenever called on to do so.This easily read book is a sort of a slim autobiography of the author, very slim biography of Marilyn, meaning that it has a few assorted facts, but mostly make up, style, grooming, and personality tips for the MM want to be. And ""want to be"" has diverse meanings.An amusing book with very interesting photos. Now in some, the author does resemble MM., but, quite honestly, in the majority, I see stark differences, and just think she really is stretching the truth. STRETCH. There was only one Marilyn Monroe, but there were, and continue to be, many, many imitators. I read that the author, now in her middle forties, this book came out in 2000, took up the real estate game, leaving the world of MM way behind."
5,I was WRONG,"I retract my previous rabid review. I had this book confused with another.The author is credible and wrote this book from Hitlers own hand-written notes.David Irving knows this man and vouches for him.I was wrong. Dead wrong. I am reading this book now, i have found a typo on page 90 ""ntended"" instead of ""intended"", proof I am reading it. I just purchased this book tonight."
1,Slanted edition,"A scholarly and succinct edition is `Hitler's Secret Book', New York: Grove Press, 1961, translated by Salvator Attanasio with an Introduction by Telford Taylor. The objectivity of its Introduction and Notes is vouched by Taylor's service as Chief Counsel at the Nurenberg trials. Book is out of print but available through Amazon as ""used & new""."
3,Not my favorite of Disney's greatest...,Ok OK I know its Disney and allthough I praised the first two Disneys Greatest I didn't like this Cd as much. It seems that they have taken all the leftover Disney songs and put them on this CD. My daughter loves this CD no matter what and I guess if it makes her happy so am I.In all I found only 5 songs worthy to be on Disney's greatest CD while the others are b- class.I am sure that hard core Disney collectors don't want this CD missing from their collection but I recommend to rent the CD first to see if its worth your money.
5,Worked fine,"What can I say? I needed a refill, bought one on Amazon and lo and behold....it worked!!! I would definitely buy again."
5,Excellent,"I thought this was an excellent first novel - well-written and plotted, with an outstanding sense of the atmosphere and character of the Silicon Valley law firm. However, I'm afraid I'm hideously biased, as I know the author. :) To those of you who are wondering about sequels, I happen to know that Ms. Wolfe is now busy as the General Counsel of a Silicon Valley software company, but she fully intends to return to writing after she retires."
3,Handy if not spectacular.,"I bought this on a whim as an order filler. It's kind of a flimsy little thing, overpriced I'd say. I'm not even sure what pies one would make with it. I use it when I have extra batter from muffins, quick breads, or cakes left over. They bake up fairly well in it. I don't use it very often, but I've had it a few years, and no rust here."
5,This Game is GREAT!,"This is so much fun. We brought it to a family party this spring, and everyone loved it. What was great about it was that everyone could play it and did. Everyone would gather around and watch the game...It seems so simple, yet when you start playing, it is not so simple to win. Loved that the entire family could play, from 88 year old grandpa to 8 year old great grandchild, in fact, they played one another, they tied.. grandpa won two and she won two.. they were going for the tie breaker, but the rest of the family wanted to play, so we had to agree to let them settle the score another day.We all had a blast with DAO... I'll be getting more of these for the rest of the family.. soon!"
2,A hard to read book,"The subject of the book is extremelly interesting and the author seems to know what he is talking about. However, I cannot recommend this book. The author presents it as a divulgative book for begginners. However, beginners will hardly take any advange of it because of the deep matters involved and the unnecessarily technical language he used. He made the mistake to write a divulgative book using the same language he would do in a scientific paper. I am afraid average readers will find it hard to read and will probably not survive the introductory chapters."
3,Still Searching by Senses Fail,"1. The Rapture (intro w/lyrics) 1/52. Bonecrusher 4/53. Sick or Sane 4/54. Can't Be Saved 5/5 (future single)5. Calling All Cars 5/5 (single)6. Shark Attack 3/57. Still Searching 3/58. To All The Crowded Rooms 3/59. Lost And Found 4/5 (future single)10. Every Day is a Struggle 4/511. All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues (techno-ish intro/outro) 3/512. Negative Space (interlude) 1/513. The Priest and the Matador 3/5Still Searching slows down a bit in the middle and at the end, but the accessible nature of most of the material begs for a second spin. If you're used to the old Senses Fail, Still Searching may take some getting used to. It has a more rock-centered sound, which is a good thing, and although I was never a fan of these guys in the past, this record turned me around. Different doesn't always equal bad, although I still feel like SF haven't quite found their own identity yet. Recommended."
4,Their first CD is better,"The first CD from Senses Fail was more raw and stronger. This sophmore album is fairly catchy and enjoyable, but not the same caliper as the first."
2,Interesting but flawed...,"While this book offers some interesting speculation into Oswald's final days, it is difficult to give a great deal of credence to a Kennedy Assassination book that misspells ""Dealey"" Plaza."
5,"The ""Album of the Year"" captures American Spirit","The highest quality music emerges from the world of pretentious indie rock just about every year without fail. The albums that succeed are the ones that can balance the line between serious composition, instrumentation, and songwriting - while still being fun enough to rock out to in a car. No other album does this better than ""Boys and Girls in America"". With the addition of a piano to the forefront, The Hold Steady have never sounded so skilled. The music is impeccably arranged, and with the blazing guitars, never fails to rock out. On top of this, the lyrics and narratives that comprise the album are top-notch, displaying Craig Finn's depth of insight into the seemingly commonplace activity of Friday night bar-hopping and partying. By exalting the stories and emotions of everyday characters, these so-called ""boys and girls in america"", The Hold Steady have captured Americana in its truest form."
1,BORING,I've just listened to all the amazon snippets after reading a positive review from Uncut. Fair enough I have not heard all of every song but what I did hear was basically the same song over and over except for the obligatory ballad. The guy is an awful singer and they sound like a good bar band at best. There are so many bands and singer songwriters who do this style of music who are 100% better than this mess
3,Recycled,"Made in JAP in 1999, Serial# MECI-25128, Playing Time 45:38If you're a MOTORHEAD completist, you probably have a CD called ""Dirty Love"".This disc includes all 11 tracks of the ""Dirty Love"" compilation, and adds as a ""bonus"" 4 tracks recorded live, which have already been released on other CDs (e.g. ""Jailbait"", ""Blizkrieg On Birmingham"").Since this is a japanese pressing, lyrics are included. The disc itself is labeled ""Rearities"" (oops!).Because of its steep price, this compilation isn't really worth it. Also note that it shouldn't be confused with the ""Over The Top - The Rarities"", an entirely different compilation of other ""rare"" material..."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was disappointed at the size of this crinkle cat toy. I expected it to be the same size as a paper shopping bag, but it is much smaller. It didn't stay open very well due to the poor construction consisting of two wires, one going around the back and one circling the front. The ""thrill"" for my cats wore off very soon, and I ended up going back to a regular brown paper shopping bag."
5,MEDICAL DICTIONARY USE FOR MEDICAL BILLING AND CODE,I BROUGHT THE MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO HELP ME IN MY MEDIACL BILLING AND CODING COURSE AND I FOUND IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL I TOLD EVERYONE IN MY CLASSES ABOUT THE MEDICAL DICTIONARY I GIVE THIS BOOK TEN STAR IF Y'LL HAD IT I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK
3,What can you say about a dictionary,"What can you say about a dictionary. It certainly meets all my expectations. Unfortunately, I didn't get the transcription job - however, I can impress my friends when they glance at my bookcase. Besides, how can you go wrong with Merriam Webster."
2,it's ok,"When I ordered this dictionary, I thought it would be a bigger and more nicely published one. It's not bad for what it is, I guess."
4,"Good Buy, Good Display",The LNR238W is defintely the best buy for the money at this time. I purchased it at PCConnection to make sure I got the LNR 238W model and not the LNR238WA after reading some of the earlier reviews. It is an easy setup.The picture definition is excellent using DirecTV. Audio quality is also very good. Highly recommended.
4,"Great price, great sentiment, great series!","This is a fantastic tribute to the Greatest Generation. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend you do. The price was exceptional as well. Thanks Amazon."
3,where is my disc?,"Everyting was find other than I didn't recieve my full order, I am missing disc one adn the pacidfic part one on blu-ray, very dissapointing to open my new collection and be missing the first disc"
3,hmm,"Well, this albulm is worth looking into, even if only because Dan Hoerner appears on it. Looking to console yourself over the break up of Sunny Day Real Estate? Then catch a taste of Dan, on this wierd little cd."
3,ok summer read,Nothing great...if you like the show/characters...this will carry you through a couple days at the beach!
3,"Interesting, Odd, and finally a bit overpriced","Hmmm... I saw this video recently and I found it to have good and bad qualities. I'll start with the former. I found the fact that they taped it with a consumer quality camera to give the film a certain unique and realistic feel. You could believe that these images weren't from hollywood. Secondly, the film did present some information and insight as to the conditions of Eritrea at that time. Now for the latter...Why on earth do the two authors of this work talk about their own lives one quarter of the film? One concerns herself with her father who has just past and tells us of his past drinking habits. The other becomes romantically involved with a local inhabitant and dares to have unprotected sex with him. And to think this whole documentary is about AIDS!Overall, it was something interesting to watch, however I wouldn't recommend one purchase it at such a steep price. See if your local library has it first!"
3,"Surprised How Disappointed I Was Over A ""Good"" Read","This is not a bad book, by any stretch, and I would recommend purchasing it for anyone who wants to bring some closure to the story line. However, having reread the first 2 books of the trilogy several times (and realizing that both volumes 1 and 2 had distinct ""tones"" that showed the author was capable of shifting perspectives without losing her audience), I was taken aback at how unsatisfying a second, or third, read this volume was. I'm not sure if it was the characters' development (or lack of it), or how ""rushed"" the action felt, but I was not captivated the way I was by volumes 1 and (especially) 2. I'm afraid that this really could/should have been one of the few series that should have had a book 4 to more fully develop (and close) the world created by the author."
4,Culmination to the series,"If you liked the first two, you have to read this one. It finishes the story. Once again, Daemon is back in the world of the sane. I like him much better that way. There was some opportunity for sibling rivalry, which she could have used, but then that might have detracted from the story.Excellent character development. I miss them all... We need more stories about Daemon, Lucivar, and Surreal. I want to know more about their lives."
3,"A worthwhile read, but a bit disappointing","Daughter of the Blood was absolutely original, imaginative, and just plain terrific. Heir to the Shadows was not as much so, and Queen of the Darkness was even less so.This trilogy had the promise of an original premise. The problem seems to lie in how the story ""falls"" together. The answers to some situations seem a bit too contrived and convenient. The so-called enemies seem a bit too weak to really pose any threat. New characters are thrown in haphazardly, and the old characters that had a role in the previous books have mysteriously disappeared, or have been reduced.I wish the trilogy could have ended on a better note, but it was still a good story to read. Daughter of the Blood will always remain a classic on my list, I'm just sorry that the next two sequels will not. However, all things aside, Ms. Bishop displays great promise. I look forward to reading her other works."
1,Disappointing follow-up to Puzzle Palace,"I read the author's previous book when it first came out. It was a ground-breaking exploration of the NSA and the role it has played. I stopped reading Body of Secrets after 85 pages because it veered suddenly into unsubstantiated conspiracy-theory hogwash. The text has no footnotes, so it is impossible to find the author's source precisely. However he has page indexed notes at the back which cite zany assasination-theory groups (the kind with the storefronts at Dealey Plaza!) Too bad he couldn't stick to the facts about a truly fascinating subject."
3,"Interesting & expansive book of data and trivia, but liberal","I found the book an interesting read, mainly for the volumes of trivial information regarding the size, breadth and expanse of NSA's reach into the world's technological community. I found the organization of the book a little confusing, but it may be a personal bias for chronological order of events as opposed to the functional order the author uses. My chief concern was eloquently outlined by another reviewer that warns of the frequent liberal political commentaries and tirades that the author embarks on which caused me to be sceptical of some of the more interesting and unusual events portrayed. Given that the author makes it no problem seeing his liberal bias you can enjoy the book with that calibration in place as you read the tale."
3,The Girls,"The Girls by Amy Goldman Koss was an okay story about 5 teenage girls that have a problem in their friendship. I can relate to each of the main characters, Maya, Renee, Darcy, Candace, and Brianna, at certian times, but what they go through isn't every interesting. I wouldn't recomend this book because you would probably get bored with it quickly. I would only read this book if i was assigned to to it, and probably wouldn't enjoy it."
3,Okay book,"It was an okay book. I liked it and I also disliked it. I think every teenage girl can relate and connect with this book.I liked it because I hve been in a position like one of the girls and I can relate or connect with her feelings. It also helped me to handle certain situations that I could come across in the future. I also liked how the author let us see every girls side of the story. Then, as a person reading the book you can understand what all the girls are thinking.I disliked the way the book went also though, too. Because it showed every girls side of the story it was hard to follow at some points."
1,The Girls,I was highly dissapointed with this book Amy Goldman Koss wrote. It was a story of five girls who did nothing but stab each other in the back and keep scerets from each other. I will tell you now i will never buy another one of her books ever again.
4,The Girls,"The Girls have four main charactors.Some of these leave Maya out of the group.Many of the girls get thrown out. I don't want to give the ending away.But at the end one girle gets to be in the group.Her name you have to figure out,and read the book.this book is one of my favorites."
3,Stephanie's Review,"This book is just ok. There is some confusion in it. I mean the book was good and all, but I have definately read better."
2,not new!,"This was suppose to be a new DVD, but it was not and when we tried to play the DVD for our grandchildren over Thankgiving... it was defective!"
5,I loved this movie!,"This was by far my favorite movie of the year, and one of my top favorites ever. It is an engaging story and well acted. I tend to like movies that tell a good interesting story, and this one does exactly that."
4,Not as good as I thought is was going to be.,"I was a good movie, it wasn't pg-13 though! scenery was great, beautiful setting.Great actors."
5,An unpolished gem,"This is a small film, without the slick styling of many bigger budget 'Hollywood' productions (no disrespect intended!), but if you let it, the delightful characters will draw you in. It is a slow-moving and some would say somewhat predictable story of self-discovery (though one set in an unusual cultural environ for most) but it's an absolute joy to follow the lead character on her journey none-the-less. Given the outstanding quality of her acting, there's no question you will be emotionally moved (probably to tears) before the end. Highly recommended."
5,Original release on CD...,"The original release on CD had the Universe album cover art and started track 1 and so on with the entire Universe album...Then right after Universe was over..Right into the self-titled album. Sounds cool right!!! Yeah that's what I thought. They left off the song/insrtumental-""Tempest"". I don't know what ever happened to my copy of that and thought I'd never find these albums again.UNTIL THE INTERNET. ON DBC'S website they released them as seperate cd's. And I got the full length first album. I also got their final release(An EP) 6 songs called ""UNRELEASED"" They wanted to do a 3rd album but the record co. wouldn't give them enough money. I had the pleasure of seeing them on the ""Universe"" tour and got to talk to them. When Universe came out I liked It better than Voivod. The EP is songs that would have been on the 3rd album. The songwriting(in my opinion) is in between the 2 regular releases. DBC is one of top ten favorites from the 80's. Was ""RUSH"" an 80's band??????"
3,As Promised But Face Is Hard To Read,"The watch is a good value and all the features are as promised. However, the green face makes the watch quite hard to read; you cannot simply glance at the watch. I am older, and don't have the best eyes, either. I wore the watch for a few days hoping that I would get used to it, but to no avail."
1,This is a bad book,"I can't even articulate how poorly crafted this book is. The characters are two-dimensional, the heroine unsympathetic and the entire story is a jumbled mess. The connections between Arthurian myth and the main narrative are tacked on and utterly confusing. There was no reason for Arthur to be present in the book at all and it seems like a cheap gimmick to gain more attention.This book is awful, and cheapens the already cheapened genre."
5,Very Inspiring,Very helpful and inspiring if you are interested in writing and/or illustrating children's books. Really liked the instructions on how to make a book dummy.
4,Kleenex,Thats what you will need while reading it--Good story anyone can relate to who has lost a parent.Really touches your heart. Easy to read/short but just enough for the author to get his message across..a must read.
5,Don't Create Regrets,"I don't usually review non-fiction books but I really enjoy Mitch Albom and I think he always has lessons for our growth and development in his writings. For One More Day was no exception. This is a heartfelt story of a man and his relationship with his mother. Early in life, Charley was his father's son until his dad abandoned the family. After that Charley pretty up tolerated his mother but he was always wishing for something more.His mother died when he was an adult leaving him with lots of regret. He made many mistakes and even tried to commit suicide. Charley magically gets another chance to live a day with his mother. This book is a tear-jerker but also is a beacon of hope. It's definitely worth the read."
3,Not his best,"This really isn't one of Albom's best. I had the sense that he wrote it quickly just to appease his publisher. It's worth reading, but not buying at full price. It really was not nearly as well written or inspirational as Tuesdays or 5 People. Both of those books nearly took my breath away. This was just average."
1,For One Moe Day,Not as good as the other books.An interesting point of view not usually seen from a man's perspective.The end did not fit the book--did not link with it and felt as if it was tacked on at the last minute. It is a good summer read.
1,"Sappy, saccharine","Growing up in the 60s, I'd be amazed when a stuttering Mel Tillis would start singing and have a voice completely unlike his speaking voice. Same for Jim Nabors as well.Mitch Albom strikes me the same way. I have read his sportswriting and have seen him many times on ESPN's ""The Sports Reporters"" on every Sunday morning. Albom is a smart, funny, sarcastic and wonderful reporter. Yet he writes trash like this.For all those reviewers who say one should always love their mother, I suggest they volunteer at their local child protection agency. All mothers are not angels.The story is sappy and corny and Mitch milks it for all its false sentiment.Albom is a great writer, sad that he does stuff like this to pay his bills."
2,The 5 People You Meet in Heaven....Again?,"Ok, so Mitch Albom basically took The 5 People You Meet in Heaven, tweaked it a little and then changed the title to For One More Day. Maybe he should have waited to write another novel until he had some fresh ideas."
4,Great joy,I think we can all relate to this book. I thoroughly enjoyed. It brought back so many memories and feelings. Loved it!!
5,For One More Day,"I found this book to be a true lesson in self-forgiveness. Also, that we should treat every day as if it was our last, to express our thoughts to those most close to us. Once again, Mitch Albom is such a compelling storyteller. He brings the concents of the book to life in an easy to read format."
2,Couldn't get into it at all,"I read this one for a book club, but was so put off by the character that I could hardly get through it. Defintely could not bond with him. Lack of depth, spare writing style, overly sentimental, not interesting."
2,Yet One More of Albon's Formula Books,"If you liked The Five People You Meet in Heaven, you'll like this one, too. I didn't care for the earlier book, and I didn't care much for this one either. Talk about a schmaltzy ( sp ? ) formula. The gazillion people who keep Albon's books on the best seller list must see something I don't. I suggest your $21.95 could be better spent elsewhere."
3,Just OK,"Mitch Albom does write interesting books, but this one especially lacked a substance I anticipate when I pick up a novel. The concept is one we can all relate to -- wanting to spend one more day with someone who has died -- but I didn't feel any particular bond with the characters, nor the grief that plagued Chick for years. I found Albom's spare writing style to be incompatible with the subject matter of deep emotion, and annoyingly choppy at times: ""I rented a car. I drove through the night ... I pulled into the driveway. I shut the engine. The sky was a rotted purple. My car smelled of beer."" While by no means a bad book, I was disappointed with its lack of depth."
4,another great read from Mitch!,"After reading 'Tuesdays with Morie""and 'The five people...""I was anxiously awaitng this book. Once again, Mitch has come through with a thought provoking tale reminding us to appreciate what we have! Can't wait for his next book!"
5,Heaven can wait,"The premise of this wonderful book is simple, but it applies to everyone. Who wouldn't want one more day to tell a loved one what you really need and want to. The hidden (?) message of this book, at least to me, is treat everyday as though it is the last time you will see someone, and let them know that you love and appreciate them, because we never know when it might be the last time for them or you."
3,It was ok.,It's a nice concept that he spent another day with his mother and was able to glimpse into her life. I feel that it pointed out what a selfish person he had been. Not an impressive story.
3,Nice Read,"Nice read, the writter made the characters come to life- There were on some chapters where the writter went into to much detail.Was not prepared for the ending."
2,Boring and maudlin,"I listened to the audio version of this book - read by the author - and resisted feeling emotions from the story because, I think, the writing and the author's voice just screamed at me FEEL SAD! THIS IS SO SAD! THIS IS SWEET! THINK THIS IS SWEET!I was intrigued by the description of the book and still think it's a very interesting idea for a story, but the character development in the story is so, so poor. By the end, I still felt like I knew the main character only in the vaguest of stereotypes-- a deadbeat dad with mommy and daddy issues. We are TOLD so much in this story and SHOWN so little, and I'm not sure how much of it was based on how annoying the author's voice was in reading this (srsly authors, never read your own book (attn: Mary Karr!)).Tuesdays with Morrie apparently is supposed to be great, but based on how much I didn't enjoy this book, I guess I'll never know if it is or isn't."
1,Awful,The only reason this book was published is because Mitch Albom first book was a huge hit. I struggled book from chapter 1 and it is a very good example of poor writing! High school students could do a better job!
4,One more Day,The book was in excellent condition arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. Many thenks
1,Waste of talent,This movie was just plain stupid despite all the great talent involved. I thought so in 1980 and seeing part of it again last week hasn't changed my mind.
2,This Movie Had A Lot of Potential But It Is Just Too Stupid!,"Steven Spielberg's 1979 film ""1941"" takes place only a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II has arrived on American shores and California is in a panic with expectations that a Japanese attack is imminent. This movie could have a been a lot of fun. Heck, Spielberg had a wonderful cast to work with but he just blows it is endless scenes of the characters acting totally idiotic and yelling at each other. There is a LOT of yelling. It is so annoying. This film could have been hilarious but Spielberg goes the route of a total goofball comedy, and a very unfunny one at that, and he's not very good with the comedy chops here with this movie. ""1941"" is very long and very much a big disappointment."
3,"Spectacular,but overlong","1941 is a perfect example of the term ""less is more"".The film has some amazing scenes(that dance scene will become a classic)but this films big budget led to huge and overlong scenes which made the movie bloated and slow in parts.But this movie is still an amazing spectacular to watch.Steven Spielberg learned the ""less is more"" lesson from this film and cut back the original shooting schedule of ""Raiders Of the Lost Ark"",turning it into a lean,entertaining movie."
4,A very under-rated comedy,"This film has always gotten a bad rap from the crittics. But don`t let that bother you, it really is a very funny film.It all revolves around the fear of a Jap invasion of CA right after Pearle Harbour. There are plenty of nuts running wild and evenone or two reasonably sane characters. It`s non-stop gags and non-stop laughs. If anything it`s too wild and crazy. Not the besttiming, with too many things going on at once.Still, I give it 4 stars just for the shear number of laughs. The bit with Slim Pickens being captured by the crew of a Jap sub isworth the price of the movie all by itself."
3,Sheer craziness,This movie has many of my favourite comedic actors such as Dan Ackroyd and John Candy. It also has the great Toshiro Mifune who starred in the great Akira Kurosawa classics. There is no real plot to speak of. It is simply a series of comedic sketches loosely tied together. The whole movie seems to make fun of the old Japan - US rivalry and the silliness this paranoia instilled in the population (remember the internment camps?). The film is silly and you have to enjoy silliness (like me) if you're going to like it.
1,poor quality,this is definateley not High definition. Looks like poor vhs copy quality on a cd. don't waste your money with this.
3,1941 A Funny Film,I give 1941 3 1/2 stars. Not quite 4 stars. The film is very funny and is still good even though it is now nearly 25 years old. It is worth viewing once every 2-3 years and is worth purchasing for under $$$$. Bulushi and Aykroyd are very funny. Good screwball comedy preying on the fears of people in California and along the western coast of a Japanese Invasion just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Slim Pickens is hilarious as the country bumkin captured by the Japanese. It is worth just seeing Slim. Worth the price of the DVD.
3,Best DVD of a bad movie,"Sure, it's a mess. Sure, it's loud. Sure, it's not funny. But all of the extras on this disc make up for that. Watch a 90-minute documentary as everyone involved tries to defend this movie. Look at production stills and lobby cards. See the theatrical trailers. One of the worst movies in my DVD collection; but one of the best DVDs in my collection. Just buy it."
1,"""Directors Cut"" is awful and no original cut included","If I am not mistaken the same problem occurred with the directors cut of Blues Brothers. These dum dums release these so-called ""Directors Cuts"" without including the original version. This longer version of 1941 completely ruins the pacing of the original version destroys the film. The original had a madcap pacing all this extra footage just weighs it down. Total bummer this movie has finally been letterboxed but the film is ruined with extra useless footage that belonged in the deleted scenes extras section"
1,DIrectors cut not as good as original version.,I personally think the original version is better. I saw the movie when I was young and was very upset with the new footage. I my opinion there was a reason the movie was cut. It was too much and the characters were rightly shown in the theatrical version. This is a great movie with an impressive all-star cast. The characters were strong enough to stand alone without any stephen king style over explanation. If anyone knows if the original exists then please let me know.
2,It isn't Anamorphic...,"All story points aside (I loved it as a kid and couldn't wait to see it again), this presentation is NOT anamorphic, not enhanced for 16x9 screens. Had I known this before I opened it I wouldn't have bought it.I think it's high time Amazon.com started stating whether or not a movie is anamorphic along with the widescreen and the other format information. (And for Universal to stop putting out nonanamorphic DVD releases)."
4,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"Do you want a movie with lots of destruction and total mayhem? How about a movie with really stupid people made up of Americans, Japaneas, and Germans? This is the film for you. Despite what most of the critics have said, I believe this is one of the funniest comdies we have around. I think the reason critics didn't like it was because Speilbergs first three movies were serious. Don't let the critics get you down. This movie will make you laugh yourself silly as the goofy Japaneas try to bomb Hollywood with their submarine with the help of a punk Nazie. But some goofy Americans are going to try to stop them. See this movie. It's good! John Belushie does a great performance as a pyscho pilot."
5,Kids of all ages love it!,"I bought this for our 5 year old grandson for Christmas. Not only does he love it, but the 11 and 3 year old grandchildren do too. Since it's winter here it's only been used inside so far but I know it will be even more fun outside. I plan to buy another one for the 11 year old's summer birthday. The adults have had fun on it too! It was easy to assemble and is sturdily built."
4,Plazma Car,Great toy for my grandchildren. I would recommend it to others who are looking for a nice unbreakable gift. Easy to learn!
5,Great book!,"I really loved this book. It was really funny and I think it is a great book for all ages. The Illustrations were great. I recommend reading all of the books by Marcia Williams. I have only read three, Joseph and the Magnificent Coat of Many Colors, The Amazing story of Noah's ark and this one, but we just ordered the one about Jonah and the whale. Buy it right now! You will love it!"
1,Needs An Orchestra,The songs chosen here are fine but Mario sings with only a piano to back him up and this is the downfall of this CD.If there was at least a small combo backing him up then this CD would be worth the money.Instead it is too musically lacking and Mario's voice can't save it!
3,Lab-tastic!,"I was rather afraid to have to do a biology lab conducted only online, but hey, I got an A and this book was a good help. Thanks lab manual!"
2,Fool me twice...shame on me...,"It *seemed* as robust as the other offerings, and it was such a great deal. Sure, the LCD on a previous Solo stopped displaying the left 15% of the screen, and sure, another had the backlight drop out - but things just happen, right? Gateway surely solved those types of issues, right? Right?Not quite. The laptop is good - when it's running. I now have it sitting on a desk, plugged into another monitor so I can see to type - backlight is out. I can't move it much, since the DC jack didn't stand up to the strain of being plugged and unplugged - it's now wrapped on the motherboard with duct tape to hold the contacts together.It's my own fault really, I knew better."
3,Cute printer - Crappy software - Crappy help,Cute printer - Crappy software - Crappy help.That about sums it up. If they didn't screw their customers with crappy software and help one could recommend it without qualification.
4,"I devoured ""Lunch""","This is not the type of book I normally read, but I took a chance and am very glad I did. This author writes in prose as urgent as the relationship between her protagonists, Nick and Olivia. Her dialogue's not the best, but her characterization's sharp and believable and managed to make me care about characters who are obviously quite sick! She managed, through them, to tap into something within my soul--and frankly, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. But as a writer myself, I'm quite impressed with her work. As a reader, I'm exhausted!"
3,=0),"LoL...I have this crazy Amarna obsession, so I was psyched when I got my grubby hands on this book, but frankly, after reading it, I just don't understand what the fuss about this book is all about. Maybe the aesthetics got lost in the translations, but whatever it was, it left me a bit disappointed. There was a nice infusion of theories surrounding Akhenaten, but it was superficial and def. could have used a little more development. And although the formatting was interesting, I didn't really like the way the characters were portrayed and overall, the story was just a bit too wishy-washy for my taste."
1,Dud,"I loved Flamingo Rising by Larry Baker, and A Good Man was Ok. But this book is terrible. I'm giving up on it after a 200 page try. I rarely punt, but sometimes you just have no choice."
4,Very happy with the purchase,"Coming from a Creative Zen Ultra, 40GB, this was a big jump! Double the space, color screen, videos... and very light and thin compared to the old one I had.Absolutely recommended!"
3,video ipod 80 gb review,"I've had this ipod for the past three weeks, and I'm still trying to learn what it can do. For one, the charger got stuck when I powered it for the 2nd time in use and I had to force it out. It also didn't come with a manual, and I'm looking now to buy a book about all I can do with the ipod. It plays music, but the main reason why I bought it was to record tv shows and movies, which at this moment I'm still not able to do. It seems they make the little device very complicated to get the juice out of it. I was trying to decide wether to buy this ipod or the Zune and decided to buy it based on other reviews I had read. I don't know if I made the right decission at this point. Maybe as I get more software to record my videos into it and as I buy a book on how to get my money's worth, maybe my opinion about it might change."
3,Can't beat the price- but expect some cosmetic scratches,"I ordered this iPod and overall am extremely happy with this purchase. It arrived quickly and there were no surprises with shipping/price etc. The only ""problem"" I have is that there are significant scratches on the silver back portion of the device. It definitely was well loved by the previous owner. I'm purchasing a cover for it (both for protection and to cover up the ugly scratches) which is going to run about $20. If you're willing to accept the surface blemishes in exchange for a great iPod with lots of storage room for your music at an unbeatable price- then I definitely recommend going this route. Just be prepared to shell out a couple additional bucks for a cover. If you're expecting something to arrive looking like new- this is not for you."
5,Good Product,"The Ipod 80Gb is the best mp3 player, you can put all your files,is amazing. The method for downloading video is not easy should be developed by Apple."
1,broke ass ipod,normally i love apple's products but the ipod classic is so big and bulky that it just doesn't feel right to carry around.
2,Sound quality sucks,"Not too much to add, features are well described in other posts but the most important quality to me (sound quality) is lacking on both this and my previous 30GB (non-video iPod)... There is a noticeable hiss when using good headphones and the encoded music has been stripped of the high and low frequency content. Don't bother plugging it in to a good stereo system.If you care about sound quality try another player. This is my last iPod."
3,"Player is great, shipping not...","I love this little player. It holds my entire collection and plays great. The only issue I have is I chose the '2-day Saturday Delivery' option, and Amazon shipped it via UPS, with does not deliver on Saturdays. Oh well, it was only a buck more for that option."
1,broken ipod,I bought a refurbushed one thinking it was a good deal. It was not. The ipod broke the day after the return window closed. Now I'm stuck with a $140 ipod that has bad hardware. If you are going to get this product I suggest you buy new.
1,bad luck,"the Ipod had a problem with its hard drive, it was very hard to conigure and technical support confirmed it was defective... unfortunatelly overseas it takes 4 weeks to get a guarantee product to be replaced by apple.So, I have not used my Ipod just yet....still waiting...:-("
5,80GB iPod is a GREAT Product,"Had the 30GB which I gave to my wife. Downloading and creating more video, plus music library continually growing, so needed the extra capacity. Also, some minor but nice enhancements. Had Black but went white this time. Upgraded my headphones to Shure, so the combination is unmatched..."
5,Fun for the eightysomethings,"As an octogenarian with a form of parkinsonism, I was pleased to find out how simple it is to use this iPod. I get the same satisfaction from my iPod as my grandchildren get from theirs, although our choice of songs is not quite the same. It is a fine portable music companion."
4,"iPod, uPod, weallPod","I like my iPod. The size, screen size, sound quality are all excellent.But...I wish there were better instructions with it. Especially instructions for navigating through iTunes.But..I really love my iPod."
1,Apple shipping iPods with computer viruses,"I purchased this Apple 80 GB iPod with Video Playback as a Christmas gift for my daughter, so it is still shrinkwrapped. Reuters reported this week that Apple recently shipped iPods which contain computer viruses. Amazon cannot (or will not) confirm whether my iPod is safe to give my daughter; instead I was provided an 800 number to call Apple which is on par with calling the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.After dropping $350 for a reasonably nice gift, my joy of giving is now obviously hampered because I don't know if on Christmas morning my daughter will unleash a computer virus on whatever computer or network into which she plugs her shiny new iPod.Amazon and Apple are two of the most prestigious companies in the world, and they really need to step up to resolve this latest debacle. I need to know if this bad Apple is going to spoil the whole bunch, and I need to know now."
4,Do I even have to say I LOVE IT!,"I have waited so long to buy an iPod and I couldn't be happier with it! Now I have ALL my music with me. Technology is so great! The only downside about iPods is that they don't come with great instructions (I guess they asssume we all know how to use them). Even though I know how to use it, there still should be some. Also, I Do not know how the video part works, but I guess I can look that up. DEFINITELY Love the iPod though."
1,no good stuff,"It does not work!!!! The digital works, but not in analog. The needle does not move at all. I have one, but I need another one, but I made a mass."
5,The best of best from Butterfingers,"This was the first album of Buttefingers and I thought that this album is the best compared to the others. The band is surely smartb in playing with music. The rythm of every music in this album is different for each other. For example, Royal Jelly are being played with violin which are played by the members of the band themselves........ friends , please support Malay Band"
3,best book around on clay because it is the only one.,I thought the author did a shallow job. I was left with more questions than answers.I do not understand why the author thinks readers want a simple explanation. I would have much preferred a 250 book on clay (see author's comment). I would not have to read every page but I could use it for reference and focus on the parts that were important to me. There may have been hope for clarity in such a book.I tried to contact 2 of the resources at the back of the book but the phones were no longer is service.I would still recommend buying this book until something better comes along.
2,i was disappointed...,"i have TERRAMIN CLAY, red desert clay, which is full of iron - which I do not need! So I got this book which promises to compare types of clay. I was hoping to see some info about most popular clays. Well, there is a chapter about types of clay but you will find NO PRACTICAL information there!He recommends eating clay for some particular ailments but based on what? Testimonials (none included)? Author's only credential seems to be ""he has been eating clay for more than 7 years"".I'm giving two stars because this seems to be the only book on that subject..."
4,Lego's Tie Fighter,"Nice model, and if you are careful, you can play with it a little. My son pretends when it falls apart that it was hit in battle. Lego's do a nice job with there Star Wars toys."
3,Crazy!,"This book is crazy, irreverent, mocking, angry, abusive...and lots of fun to read. I feel sorry for the author though. No one should have to struggle that much.If you're looking for a concise handbook geared towards those unfamiliar with the beliefs, practices, and guidelines of Orthodox Judaism, you should tryThe Outsider's Guide To Orthodox JudaismIt's a great gift for your ""outsider"" friend, boss, or coworker."
1,No You Can't,"Being a Catholic means sharing the faith of the Church. When one no longer can do that one is no longer a Catholic. Your body may be in Church, but your spirit is outside. Don't fall into the authors trap."
4,Great European style waffles,"Just as it claims, this waffle iron makes perfect waffles very quickly. Be aware, though, that these are thin waffles, rather than the traditional American waffle, so you'll be making more than you usually do to feed a hungry family. They're very pretty waffles, though. Just thinner than what I was expecting. (Although Belgian waffles are too thick.)"
5,Heart shaped waffle iron-from my Norwegian heritage-,"I have only used it once at this point, but like it very much. Cooks fast, Variety of settings allow for whole grain or regular waffles. I can't speak to it's longevity, at this point as I just received it as a Christmas gift and have not had time to use it more yet."
1,"Cheap paint, great waffles","This waffle maker makes great waffles, but on the first day I used it, the white letters / labels (""baking"", ""ready"", etc.) all smeared when I went to clean it with a damp paper towel. Now I have to guess at the waffle texture, too. Cheap paint on a good product. Hopefully they'll fire the paint supplier and replace my waffle maker with one that's worth the money."
5,Great quality and produces great waffles!,"Based on the recommendation from America's Test Kitchen, I ordered this waffle makerChef's Choice M840 WafflePro Express Waffle Maker, Traditional Five of Hearts. I was holding out for one of the ""flip-over"" commercial units like they have at hotels these days, but they loved it and happily, so do I. It's very well made and the waffles are great tasting and we used the grocer brand ""just add water"" mix. Using the ""Deep Bake"" /""uniform texture"" setting makes the waffles just perfect!"
1,Very thin waffles,"I was expecting traditional style waffles, but shaped like hearts. However these aren't really waffles, they are more like pancakes/crepes with a waffle pattern. Very thin. My kids refused to eat them, and I didn't like them, so we are returning it."
1,SMELLS,"I do not know why anyone is using this machine, it smells toxic! When I read the instruction, it says that the machine would smell due to the nonstick coating and indeed it does!! I can't eat anything that smells like that, no matter how good it looks. Will probably cost my health down the road."
1,Not thrilled,"Well, I have been using a waffle iron from the 60's which is on its last legs. I chose Chef's choice M840 based on the review in Cooks Illustrated. Right now I am not a happy person - waffles on the lower setting are too mushy and on the crisper setting are like dry thin toast. It appears I need to play with the recipe by making it thicker. The recipe I use may be over a 100 years old and who wants to mess with an old stand-by."
3,Certainly not a masterpiece.,I'm not a Tyrone Power fan but I don't denigrate him either.It is just that Blood & Sand is one of his lesser movies. For one thing he is just to damn pretty. The techicolor is marvelous & gets a star.There are several actual bull-fighting scenes in the movie. When they go into the studio to do Power's close up it is obviously fake. The whole effect is rather cheesy.The good news is that this is the break-out film for Rita Hayworth. Linda Darnell is beautiful as she always is. It was fun to see a young Anthony Quinn in a supporting role
2,Hat boy eats another pie,El elephante es gristy. Tyrone has powers? Woooooo! Mr. Jimmyshang! Yippe! ?
4,Anthony Quinn and Rita Hayworth dance,"Boyhood rivals Tyrone Power and Anthony Quinn grow up to be rival matadors.So far, so what. But then they become rivals in love. Now you have a story. Power is the first to get involved with the lucious Rita Hayworth but then Quinn moves in for the prize. It is rare that one scene can make an entire movie worth the purchase price but the scene in which Quinn and Hayworth dance is that scene. Quinn uses the moves of a matador with Hayworth dancing the part of the matador's twirling cape in her rose colored gown. When the cafe patrons shout ole` the viewer is one with them.Hayworth and Quinn had an affair while participating in the movie. Watching them dance it could not have been otherwise. GET THE MOVIE."
2,"My one word review, ponderous.","The only Tyrone power movie I have not liked! Beautifully filmed with a great cast, it is so slow moving as to be unwatchable, I started fast forwarding halfway through at the request of the other viewers. The look at the bullfighting culture was interesting and the role of Curro the newspaper ""sports"" writer played by Laird Cregar was superb,the camera loves Power and of course Rita Hayworth, who remains a hot dish 70 years later. All the elements for a great classic film but I just couldn't believe this was directed by the same man who had done ""The Mark of Zorro"" only two years earlier. My one word review would be ""ponderous""!"
5,Oak Ridge Boys,I enjoyed the Oak Ridge Boys since they were made up of the current singers and got away from being totally gospel. They still sound great on gospel music and were one of the top groups in Country Music. It's nice to have most of their hits in one collection.
3,Great Concept - Poor Quality,"This game is wonderful for all ages, however the quality of the product is not good at all. There are many different prices for this hand held game. The manufactor does not sell it. I have purchased over the years at least 10 of these games. The screen fades out, or it freezes, or just dies after a few uses.I wrote to the company that I ordered it through and the sent me a response that was insulting at best. Basically they said what do you expect for the price you paid....Unfortunately having a brain freeze and cannot remember who I purchased it through, when I do remember I will send it out....However it was delivered through Amazon which always come though with heir deliveries in a timely manne."
1,Illuminated WORD,"I have received two of these games so far. Neither one works correctly. I'm waiting for a third one which, hopefully, will work. I would not reccommend it at this time."
4,Nice Way to Pass the Time,This is a fun word search game. The backlight works well and it's a nice size. Not really fond of puzzles that are bigger than 8 x 8 because you have to scroll the screen. Would rather see the letters get smaller so they fit on one screen. Also they stylist is nice for highlighting the words. Wish there was a way to attach it to the game when not in use. I have lost it s few times. Overall the game is a fun way to pass the time.
1,Nothing against the seller...,"All is well with the seller. However...I bought this as a gift for a family member. Unfortunately, I bought it more than 30 days in advance and I'm not going to ask the seller to accept my claim. The shipping was fine and I have no problem with the seller. The game out of the box however is a piece of ****. My family members and I have tried all but everything to get the game to respond...all to no avail. It lights up but will not respond to any outside stimuli. It was kind of embarrassing to present a gift to an elderly person and it not work. You can imaging the problem solving that ensued. Oh well. Not seller's fault"
1,Great game - poor product design,"I love this word game - I could play it for hours. I would pay up to $50 for a good quality, easy to read & operate touch screen..Game makers please take note..."
4,Good Read,"The third in the ""Truth"" series, this one seemed a bit more predictable to me than is typical of this author. It was still tough to put down.I'm looking forward to the conclusion of this series in ""Final Truth."" However, there was one line in this book that I'm afraid may've given away the next book. I hope that's not the case, since I'd hate to not have the shock value of this coming out. But I guess I'll have to wait until next year to find out."
5,Fantastic Tchaikovsky Set by Pierre Monteux,"I totally agree with the review from Mr. Knight. The recording is lyrical, powerful, emotional and excellently recorded. I purchased my set used thru Amazon Maketplace. I prefer the listening and playing qualities of this Pierre Monteux set over the Mravinsky Tchaikovsky DG set. If you can find the Monteux Edition Tchaikovsky set PURCHASE IT IMMEDIATELY. It is out of print and it is fabulous music."
4,"Normal Heart, Magnificent Play","While I consider myself a regular theatre-goer, I've always been aware of Kramer's plays and opinions, yet I haven't seen nor read either of these two plays. That changed this past weekend when I saw the revival of Normal Heart currently playing off-Broadway. This is a viscerally emotional piece of theatre and it makes one feel impassioned about what was going on in the world then and sheds a new light as to what's going on now in regards to the HIV/AIDS crisis. It's a must red if you don't have a chance to see it."
1,Editorial Review.,"I was hoping to purchase an actually funny take on life and the crazy relationship between pets and their owners. All I bought was the comparability between terrible and horrible. Have we not seen this formula before in other strips? It tries to be cute, then it tries to be sarcastic, all to poor results. I have a cat but that does not make this lame strip likable. My cat has more personality than all the week characters portrade here. How about something original?"
2,Bad kitty,"My daughter collects all the Get Fuzzy books. When I saw this was a hard copy I was very excited. They fell to mention the book is like a 5 x 5 and a sentence or two on every other page. Of course my daughter will enjoy adding this bad kitty to her collection but I think the ""hard copy"" description was deceptive."
4,Un buen libro guia,"Indiscutiblemente, las emociones y sentimientos nos revelan que tan cerca o alejados estamos dle camino que hemos elegido, este libro explica el importante papel de las emociones como un sistema que guia para ser, hacer otener lo que queramos. La segunda parte del libro tiene una serie de procesos muy interesantes, para tener control de nosostros, de nuestro pensamientos y emociones y poder ser unos co-creadores denuestra ""realidad"".Lo recomiendo."
1,WPN311Wireless card ORDER,I'm still not received my product so far and I've totally forgot that I made this order. Please help...
1,"Half-works, but doesn't do what it claims and what I bought it for","I bought this card solely because of the 108Mbps MIMO ability, to go along with my Netgear WPN824 router which lists this as the compatible card on the back of its box.NO WHERE, not on the box, not on the spec sheet, not in the online manual, etc does Netgear ever tell you what they told me on the phone: THIS CARD WILL NOT WORK IN 108MBPS MODE WITH WINDOWS 2000. In fact, they actually list this mode as working with XP and Win2k, but not Vista.Well, this is bad news for me since I paid about 4 times as much for this card as I could have for a 54G PCI card, because foolishly I thought Netgear products in the same line (Rangemax) would work with each other and with the operating system they are advertised to work with. Guess I'll have to write Netgear a letter next, but I won't be buying any of their products again unless I have money to waste and feel like some experimenting and disappointment."
1,2 years of misery and frustration,"The random and incurable blue screen problems with this card are legendary. A quick Google search of ""wpn311"" and ""blue screen"" will give any prospective buyer all the information he/she needs to look elsewhere. Whatever the ultimate cause, this card does not seem capable of working with Windows XP.Two years ago, I made the mistake of installing these cards in my office desktops. About 1000 blue screens later, I finally gave up and replaced them. I've tried every software update, every firmware fix, and spent days with customer support to no avail.One thing that might be helpful to those struggling with this card is that the Windows software seems to work better than the Netgear abomination. (including the latest update 2.0) My recommendation however would be to abandon this network card all together and get something else."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON,"Amazon is trying to pass on the older edition of this book as the new edition. I tried two times and I keep getting the orange cover book, which is a 2002 edition not the 2007. Once you get this book you will have a hard time getting your money back."
1,Poor Video Reproduction,"Just bought this DVD,the video is very blurred that you cannot make out the actual photoshop palette's so essentially loosing what the author is trying to tell you, they should have rather used a real time capture of the screen directly on the computer and merged it into the DVD.In fact the lessons would have been better as apple movies on a DVD that you can simply click each one and follow the movie while practising live on photoshop,Also sample files and photos would have been great,the american twang also gets irritating as well.I have over 8 years photoshop experience and 20 years in the photographic and computer industry and have seen many ""free"" lessons that are far better."
1,Don't Buy It,"The product is sticky and it stays on the fur. Moreover, I followed the directions to a T . . . but when my cat shook her head, the product went into one of her eyes. It was clearly extremely painful for her. There is no caution anywhere on the label stating that this product is an eye irritant or worse. I bought this product to help my cat's ears, not hurt her eyes. I called the company and found them quite unhelpful."
4,Size not as advertised,I'm giving it four stars mainly because I expected something bigger. I don't think the vendor should list the dimensions of the card the product is mounted on. The actual product is nine inches in diameter.
1,Buyer beware,I bought this camera last year. After taking 3 pictures it stopped working. It would not open properly and sometimes when it opened it would not close. It eats batteries at a ridiculously fast rate. When I contacted Kodak about the problems they told me the shipping charges would be $48 and it would cost a minimum of $100 to repair. A very expensive and disappointing experience.
3,Not that great,"I purchased this camera as an upgrade from my kodak c330 4 mp. I was disappointed because my old kodak took better pictures than this model. The zoom is great and the video mode is amazing, but I just wasn't pleased with the image quality of the pictures. I returned the camera and bought a Canon."
3,"Nice, but...","Upon receipt of this camera, we opened the box and found it very intuitive to operate. Nice, large screen on the back, good feel and heft, with apparent decent build quality. The problem came, though, on closer inspection of the camera's power source. It uses a proprietary battery pack, and in looking for cost of backup batteries and chargers, it pretty much negates the initial cost savings of the camera, so we opted to return it for the Canon S3 IS. We're very happy with this model, though we miss the large screen of the Kodak."
1,Date battery NOT replaceable,"I purchased 2 of these cameras 2 years ago, one for my wife and one from my son. I have loved the cameras up to this point BUT.........and here is the big BUT........about 2 or 3 weeks ago (and within 1 week of each other) for BOTH cameras the date started resetting EVERY time the main battery was removed. After a few call with KODAK it was determined that the backup battery was dead in BOTH cameras.....and here is the BAD part.....they are internal in the camera and must be replace by a servicing technician at $80 per camera!!!%%%%###%%%!!!Needless to say I am NOT happy about this. All KODAK can do is appologize and say ...there is nothing we can do about it. I have been a long time KODAK customer BUT that ends with these 2 cameras. VERY DISAPPOINTED in thier customer service. TOO bad.....KODAK used to be a good company. They lost my business with this ordeal."
3,Camera is nice but battery situations sucks,"I like the 12X zoom and the photos are good so far. I expected a little better based on the fact that I was upgrading from a 3.1MP Panasonic. I still have to learn some more about the settings since some pictures were blurry--probably my faultMy main problem is with the battery. The CRV3 lasts pretty long (300+ with lots of reviewing), but isn't cheap. I bought mine at a store and was mislead to believe that it would run with normal AAs or rechargeable NiMH AAs. Nope! Not for very long anyways, maybe 20 and 2 photos respectively.I am going to get a KLIC-8000 and a charger but that will cost me another $50. I assume it will last pretty long, too expensive to buy a backup. For the extra $50 I would have considered some other cameras where I could also still use my rechargeable AA batteries that I use for everything else I run."
4,Kodak 712 IS,"The camera is great and every thing I expected. The only thing I have a small complaint about is, although the camera was at a very reasonable price I had to spend more money getting a rechargable battery and a charger. I would have prefered that the camera was listed with and without these options."
3,Awesome camera...but...,"We are super pleased with the quality of the camera. Picture quality is awesome. However, batteries drain super quickly. It doesn't work with just double A batteries...you have to use the C2 (Double AA's taped together) and they need to be Kodak. We have bought rechargeables...don't work. So, if you are willing to spend $10 everytime you need a set of batteries...it's worth it. Again, the camera is our favorite and the best...you will see us paying $10 for batteries..."
1,Can't recharge batteries,"The camera is incapable of recharging its own batteries and kills AA batteries in less than a couple hours of use, so add another $100 to the cost as you will need a charger and a pair of rechargable batteries in order for the camera to fuction.Customer service is unknowledgable, unhelpful, and at times even deceiptful. Over the first year of use, I mailed the camera in three times for repairs. The first time they performed their usual clean-and-return treatment. The second time they kept it for two weeks and mailed it back untouched (a fact that they confirmed during later phone calls). They never conceded that the unit was faulty and never replaced the unit.I will not buy Kodak again."
5,Good Camera i have pictures!,I got this camera christmas 2007 and it really is a great camera.The pictures turn out great. Has a lot of settings which is a plus.I never bought the chargable batteries for the camera but i bought some energizer ones and they last a long time i can take picture the whole day on the same 2 batteries.The only thing i dont like is the size. well i dont mind it but i just always have to have a handbag when i want to take it with me. It would be better if it was pocket size but oh well.I am an amateur photographer and this was a great first camera for that but i am going to be moving on to something more advanced.im going to upload a couple of pictures i took with it to my profile. feel free to check them out
2,cueing not that great and the participants were abit off putting,"I heard that she was a good instructor so i got this and the total fitness workout. the total fitness workout was great, but this was disappointing. the cueing wasnt great and she didnt tell which leg she was starting with. some of the partipants were either moving too fast and the music didnt really go with the workout."
4,DEJA VU! Watching 50s TV while listening to this CD!,"Patti Page's 50s TV show was a staple at our house. AND it was shown in reruns around the world into the 70s at least. These recordings bring back great memories but some of the selections lack that Hi-Fi sound were are used to listening to. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is the sound quality of some of these. These were remastered from the TV show recordings, not the master tapes which were sold to Mercury records and released on many albums in the mid 50S."
4,and tango makes three,"Such a heart warming story, how anyone could think to have this book banned must be so into themselves. Some kids I have read the story to all just want to go see tango and the daddies in person and that includes myself.Well worth the money to get the book. THANK YOU"
1,come on...,"Although well written, this book is absolutely inappropriate for elementary school children and should not be introduced until a mature age."
5,All need to read,A story that in a great way teaches a very important lesson. Bought it after seeing a group of kids enjoying it and knew my grand daughter must have May buy another to share with the kids I babysit for
4,"Cute, loving, lovely","This is a sweet little story about relationships, about a couple who wants a child and gets to adopt.OK, so they are penguins. OK, so they are MALE penguins. It still seems to me a book about loving families.Little children won't care that they are penguins--how many anthropomorphic families do they read about in a year? And the ""alternate lifestyle?"" Puh-leeeeze! This book is targeted for young kids--so young most of them don't know yet what makes us ""male"" or ""female.""I wish ""regular"" families in books were so sweet! And the illustrations are lyrical and easy on the eyes. You get a sense of personalities but the characters are not too cartoony.One star deducted for writing that's just a bit uneven in quality, switching at times from a nice fairy tale-ish narrative to ""educational.""I've read that since the book was published, the penguin couple had a painful break up, one of them leaving for a female. WHO CARES? This isn't the Chronicles of Narnia; it's a picture book."
2,It was not what I expected.,"I thought it would be better than the last video of the X-Games, but it was not, was a big disappointment, so much equipment was supposed to be an excellent video. The above video is by far surpasses this. Make no coverage to bmx, with as many variations in that competition and other disciplines such as in-line skate. Disappointing."
2,not that good,in my opinion this product is a horable. it has no power to it and it takes so long to reload and pump it. mine broke after about an hour. I made my mom send it back. if i were you i would get a nice dye paintball gun insted!!!
1,Ours simply won't work,"We must have received a bum product because despite the other reviews, ours simply won't work. We've gone from Jet puffed marshmallows to the cheap kind, even tried minis, still didn't work. We tried greasing the rubber washer in the chamber, still didn't work. We're out of ideas. We can get a build up of pressure, but not enough to propel the marshmallow out of the chamber. Bummer; this seemed really cool."
2,Mediocre,Def to much for a price of plastic.. I was hoping for something a bit more impressive but it failed
4,grand kid fun,We have these for the grand kids and grandpa to play with. Great harmless fun. It does leave litter of marshmallows laying all over the farm. But in Oregon after a couple of days the rain has washed them all away.
1,Not Even Compatible With Its Own Equipment!,"Bought the RangeMax wireless router about a year ago and don't notice that much difference from Netgears old 108 Super G router. That one was rock solid for me and connected to everything as advertised. However, after 3 different computers and hours of frustration I've about given up on getting anything above 54g using the WPN111 with the RangeMax router. Technical support was no help after several frustrating email exchanges there.The fact that the WPN111 won't connect at 108 speeds is particularly frustrating when Netgear's old Super G card does so without a hitch!(...)"
1,Please Look At Other Wireless Adapters,"I have had this adapter for about a year now and this has given me a major headache. When I first got this adapter it worked just fine, I can surf the net and download files in an instant then about 2 months later the problems began. I first noticed that it took hours to load my home screen of my operating system account. It usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes to load my background and programs. then once it connects to my router it takes another twenty five to thirty minutes to connect to the internet. I have also faced the same problems with the adapter dropping the connection when I am connected to the net. In summary, this is one of the worst wireless adapters available in the market today. Please, I encourage you to look at other alternatives for wireless adapters. This one is not worth your money."
2,A waste of money,"I purchased 3 of these adapters for different users. Each user had constant connection problems. Since I wasn't sure at first if the problem was the adapter or the router, I replaced one of the adapters with an internal PCI wireless ethernet card. The connection problems went away for that user.In addition to really lousy connections, the adapter overheats. It gets so hot, you can hardly touch it. This strikes me as a fire hazard.Avoid it, if you can."
4,Decent in its category...,"This category of products - wireless usb adapters - seems pretty new, as it is not yet plug-and-play compatible (it needs a software CD), and it has spotty connectivity. This adapter has fairly bad reviews, but compared to its competitors, you wont find too many better products.Installation was a pain - after spending hours trying to install it (on Vista), I finally figured out a way to make it work. And when it does work, it is very fast - so no problems there.However, it does not automatically start after waking the computer from sleep mode, and heats up after only an hour of use (or of idleness). Whenever it shuts off, you have to unplug it and plug it in again, and pray it works! Overall, though, it is a decent product that is well worth trying out."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I purchased this product and ran home to try it out. not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer, my computer freezes. I restart and it says my device is malfunctioning. I manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again. I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I'm a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect. This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing. I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn't supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn't even let me return the product. My advice: go with linksys or d-link or SMC, ANYONE but netgear."
2,Unimpressive,"I bought the RangeMax router along with two WPN111 and two WG111 USB adaptors.I am unimpressed with all of the USB adaptors. They seem to have significant issues with any sort of long-term connectivity, and were extremely difficult to even get working.Furthermore, installing the latest drivers for this product seem to break it, and stop it from communicating with the AP entirely. It took complete removal of all the drivers and re-installation of the old ones from the CD to get these adaptors working at all.The router is approximately 3 meters away from the adaptor with an uninterrupted line of sight. There's little or no EM interference, and yet the setup still only manages to get a signal strength of 65%.Recommended only for those that require ease of use, such as occasionally connecting a laptop to the wireless network.For anything else, get a better device."
5,Splash Bar Tape; Pleased,"I was pleased with the bar tape that I received. It's nice to see such a variety for splash bar tapes, you don't see that very often."
4,Excellence realized upon the Exodus,"This is the full-length conclusion of one of the truly defining ensembles of a genre. Perhaps extending the road that the Velvet Underground, Spacemen 3, and Galaxy 500 had laid, Bedhead perfected rock music that leaves you as content as a warm bed on a cold rainy Sunday morning. You are not going anywhere, and there is no place you would rather be.Transaction De Novo provides a hint of aggression that I have not seen from them, but it still seems comforting despite of its dissonance. Bedhead's ability to demonstrate complexity with the simplicity of its variables achieves a work of art that generations should cherish. I'm just sorry I didn't appropriately embrace them until they were gone."
2,"Too much summary, not enough real emotion","The reviewers have not been kind to this book and having read it, I know why. It has too much intellectual stuff and not enough true emotion. It has too much summary and not enough rendered experience. The locales, the historical references, the literary allusions all add up to prove that Erica did a great deal of authentic research about ancient Greece and Delphi and all that. But making a non-tendentious novel by the non-episodic coherent intergration of all this information is something she didn't do. You will get more enjoyment from reading her other works such as Fruits & Vegetables, Half-Lives, Fear of Flying, and Witches."
2,"Way inferior to PSAPPHA, a novel of Sappho","I bought this novel together with PSAPPHA by Peggy Ullman Bell and there is no comparison between the two nor should there be. Jong's Sappho's Leap is an obvious parody of Greek fiction through the ages whereas Bell's PSAPPHA may well become a modern classic. Where Sappho's Leap is based on mythology and comic plays, PSAPPHA stands on a firm foundation of Sappho's own words - what few of them are left to us after centuries of censorship and deliberate destruction.For those contemplating purchase and wanting a quality read, I hightly recommend PSAPPHA, a novel of Sappho instead of Sappho's Leap. Or, buy them both. This one is good for a lot of laughs."
4,"Very useful, in some respects","I was assigned this book as an undergraduate and quite honestly, didn't give it much of my time. But looking it at it now, while doing my MA, I wish I had! The practical information about writing theses, footnotes/endnotes, and stylistic problems seems especially important for any student. The examples and formats weren't particularly useful to me...I think the space would have been better spent on straight-up research papers instead all the unique ones, like writing policy recommendations and book reviews. Perhaps this will be useful to some students though. All in all, I think it's a great reference to have the shelf and I use it now as a guide to answer any of the basic questions about research that I may have."
5,A Great Farming Simulator,"Harvest Moon 2 is a great game. It is relaxing, serene, and will keep you playing for hours at a time. The object is to create a booming farm within three years. The game can be challenging at first, but will become fun very quickly. It upset me at first because the instruction booklet does not go into great detail at all, but like I said, when you figure it out, it will become your favorite game. You can play as a male or female farmer, and you can also pick a dog or a cat as a pet. There are many challenges, but overall a great game. If you are interested in something different from the majority of GBC games, I would recommend this game to you. It is a really great game!"
5,One of the best games for the Gameboy,"This game is DEFINATLY one of the best games for the gameboy. you start off on a farm, you either have to make it a booming farm, or the land will be turned into a cheesy amusment park. You have to clear the feilds of weeds, rocks, and tree stumps before you can till it to plant seeds. If you water them every day, they will grow, then you can sell them. You can also raise cows. They are the Cutest drawn cows i have ever seen! In addition to cows, you can raise chickens and sheep. If you have a friend with Harvest Moon 2, you can trade cows, chickens, and sheep. it is essential to comleting a treasure hunt that gives you something that is one of the best items in the game. There are yearly festivals, including horse races, thanksgiving, and the new years. I would encourage anyone who loves to be ocupied for hours with an interesting game to buy this!"
3,Saving Problems,"This game is soooooo frustrating! Everytime I save the game and not play for awhile, I turn it back on all the saved data is erased! I hope Natsume has improved on Harvest Moon 3!"
3,"It's troublesome, but also fun","I've found this to be a really fun game, but at sometimes, it's more trouble than it's worth, it's work instead of play sometimes. Most of the time I find myself trying to please my cows, all the while having to run everywhere I go just to get part of a days work in. Since there is only about 15 minutes a day, it's fairly difficult, but I think that it is worth while! However, even this game has it's rewards."
2,Harvest...Yawn,"I personally thought this game would be fun and a long played out game for road trips, boy was I wrong. Sure it was fun at first, but then you just wait for everything to happen. The message board hardly changes and you do the same thing every day. (That's the game's day) Fun points, It is long and pretty easy. I beat it on on very long road trip. Second, the mini-games are fun. (Better than the actual game)"
3,I got the double DVD,"I got the double DVD,hopefully I'm reviewing the right one here, and the insane abs is boring and it is not challenging enough like the bootcamp abs are. With the bootcamp abs at least I can still feel my stomach hurt for a couple of days. With the TaeBo Extreme I got tired of doing all the butterflys. Billy does keep you going but when he starts talking about the beat of the music and asking us at home can we feel the beat the music is a bit off from what kind of exercise were actually doing. Don't get me wrong I love doing TaeBo and I'm not complaining its my review and I find both DVD's not challenging enough like his bootcamps are."
3,"Hard to follow, Hard to do, but great for your body","As someone who doesn't know my left from my right, I have a hard time watching the people in the video moving to their right (my left), and then translating that while doing it at the same time. It would be more helpful if it was shot from behind (the way you would actually learn it in a class anyway).If you're not as dyslexic as I am, this video would be pretty effective. My husband and I do it together and it is hilarious to see how lame we are."
1,Doesn't Work,"This is a really bad Paul Simon album (I never thought I could even think those words). It is by far his worst, so far below anything he has ever released. I recently went on the net and read a few interviews with Paul Simon. All of them referred to how Paul is a craftsman, takes great care with his work, and won't release anything that he is not proud of. In light of his comments over the years I am frankly surprised that this is even out there. I have just about everything that Simon has released and I like everything except You're The One. The songs are unmemorable, the lyrics are often forced and awkward. After I recently had a renewed interest in Paul's music I went back and listened to this cd again, thinking perhaps I was too hard on it. I could barely get through one listen. If you are considering getting this you would do much better to instead buy any of Paul Simon's other works."
3,Greatest?,"I'm a long time fan of Roger Whittaker and saw him live at the Jahrhunderthalle in Frankfurt, Germany, over 30 years ago. I was disappointed at the number of cover tracks in this set. There seemed to be a lot of filler tracks to make this a large set. I guess those define the ""finest"" part of performances."
5,Highly Recommended,"""The Ultimate Guide to Goddess Empowerment"" by Sophia is simply wonderful. If you are interested in learning more about the great goddesses (or, the goddess in her manifold forms) and/or learning about the magical path and its relation to the goddesses, you will be glad that you have this book as a reference guide...I've read two other books by Sophia and must say that I truly appreciate her clear, straightforward, and supportive style and admire her considerable store of wisdom and knowledge...This book is well-researched and offers much for both beginner and 'seasoned' practitioner."
2,A Mottled Album of Life in Belken County,"This book was interesting in its style, but other than that it was muddled and hard to follow. The body of the book was merely vignettes of life in Belken County and the people that live there. I had a hard time concentrating on which character was who and who they were related to and why they were important. The style was an interesting one to read, but extremely hard to follow and left me wanting more of a plot, not just many small ones interlinked by the commonality that the people in these stories were all living in the same county."
5,Sanese con los Angeles,"Este libro no solo es para leerlo y guardarlo en un cajon, este debe ser utilizado como una herramienta para lograr muchas cosas en la vida, todo aquello que te ha tenido mal puede ser curado, puedes ver una guia, puedes solucionarlo por ti mismo con ayuda de estos seres celestiales y maravillosos, que para muchos solo estan pintados en cuadros religiosos, pero en realidad estan a tu lado para darte la mano en cada paso bueno y advertirte de si este paso podria estar herrado.Leelo una y otra vez, practica cada cosa que te enseña y trae, ayudate a ti y a todas las personas que estan contigo, haras una buena eleccion si lo has de comprar.gracias."
1,Doesn't work with our critters,"I really wanted the Havahart Critter Ridder to work, but unfortunately it hasn't helped with our critter problem. We have squirrels around our house daily, and skunk and raccoon that come into our yard every week or so to dig up our ground cover looking for grubs. I have tried repellent sprays and other products before, but nothing seems to deter them. I followed the directions on the Havahart Granular Shaker, and applied it where we most often have a problem. Although we continued to have squirrels appear every day, I was hopeful about keeping the other animals away because nothing happened for about a week. However, after about seven days I awoke to find my ground cover dug up in many of the places where I had applied this repellent. Even if it did work for seven days (which is doubtful because we've gone that long before with no incidents) it would be far to expensive to apply it every week. I won't try this product again."
4,Great cat repellent,"I recently noticed that a neighborhood tom had started marking my front porch -- not exactly the kind of fragrance you want to welcome your guests.One application of the Havahart granules in the planters he was spraying and he hasn't been back, woohoo! On the negative side, it will get washed away so you need to reapply more often than every 30 days if the area gets irrigated or if it rains, so it can get quite expensive. But hey, it works!"
3,"Works, but for less than a week!","I ordered this because I needed to find something that would keep Lady, my black lab mix dog, out of the garbage. The mice like to burrow underneath the garbage cans, and Lady loves to dig, trying to get to the mice. This worked. In fact, after the first application, she tried to dig under the garbage cans, and she looked at me in disgust and walked away. Unfortunately, this only worked a week, instead of the 30 days promised. Lady is back to digging.If this had worked for the full 30 days, I would have bought a year supply of it, just to keep Lady away from the outside garbage cans. Unfortunately, it is too expensive to apply every week. I'm still searching for the perfect product."
5,So far so good...,"It's generally hard to prove a negative so I am going to have to pledge to come back and revise my review if things change in the future, but so far so good. We have a very bad problem of chipmunks (and possibly other types of animals) digging tunnels in our yard and under our house so we were very hopeful that this would work. After sprinkling it everywhere we saw a hole and near all the access points to the under the house areas we are not seeing any more animals, but then again we only saw them every few weeks or so before. This weekend we are going to fill the holes with fill dirt and then after that we will see if this product is really working based on whether or not we see new holes, especially near the house. anyway, like I said so far so good but this will need more time for monitoring. If I find later on that this product is not helping I will revise this review so if you are reading this now everything is still OK."
4,works well,"I had a terrible time with ground squirrels and rabbits eating our new plantings this year. I used this item in conjunction with other products, including moth balls, and it made the difference between survival and replanting. I can't say this product did it all, but as part of the mix, I was very pleased with the results."
2,Another dud,I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly. I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden. Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants. What a disappointment.
2,Doesn't work for squirrels,"We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house. Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied. He stayed quite a while, dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me. I'm not at all impressed with this product and don't recommend it."
4,Seems to work (for cats). Smells bad (but that's the point),"It is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working, but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas I used this. It has a peppery smell which is an irritant. This is obviously how it works. In areas that do not get rained on the odor, and presumably the effectiveness seems to last (several weeks now). In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective. This may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates.The shaker container is easy to use and stays closed/sealed between applications.So far, so good."
2,Sorry. Can't tell it did a thing,"I really thought about buying another brand of this, just because my neighbors little dogs always runs into my front yard and I don't mind but it sets my dogs up to barking and that is annoying! Well, I used the whole canister of this across the whole front of my yard and my neighbors little Papillon and Chihuahua just came right on in, right across the ""barrier"". So, I don't know how it works to repel varmints but I certainly didn't see any result with small dogs."
3,Used around our birdfeeders,"We wanted to try Critter Ridder to see if it would help keep the squirrels away from our birdfeeders.To be honest, it seemed to keep them away but it also seemed to keep the birds away too."
3,Cridder ridder Granular,"Not nearly as good as the liquid in a dry climate (Aizona). I suspect the oils in the composition evaporate nearly as fast as water here, enen in the cooler winter months. I was using it to keep pack-rats from munching on my car wires (newer cars are using soy based insulation to be green but rodents are certain it is food). It worked for about a week and then more rodent damage and a $200+ car repair for the same. It is supposed to last 30 days. I found moth balls, lights, and ultrasonic repellers have been a lot mote effective. The liquid Critter Ridder was sprayed on the wires and the granular product was used as a perimeter. It didn't deter pack-rats but it does keep rabbits away (they seem to like the shade under my cars and they keep away so I don't have to shoo them away or worry about crushing them when I drive off if they still think they are hiding, they aren't too bright you know)."
2,It seems useless,I spray the repellent in my backyard to repel those little things. But useless they keep moving to my backyard everyday. I need to do some thing else.
3,"Keeps wild things away, does nothing for suburban creatures","I have a lake house in the Pennsylvania woods and have long had problems with small wild creatures in my shed and trash area. I had only partial luck with ammonia, commercial urine products and other repellants. I found Havahart worked quite well, although as other reviewers have noted, an application does not last 30 days, more like 10 days depending on conditions.I recommended it to a friend in the Connecticut suburbs, it did nothing for him. Scanning the other reviews, this appears to be consistent. My guess is the repellant resembles something common enough in areas with moderately dense human population that the local creatures are indifferent.So, based on my experience, use it for wild creatures in the woods, but do not expect good results in areas with too many humans around."
2,NOT GOOD!,"I bought this about a month ago and used the whole container in a 300sf area in my yard to deter pests from coming on my property. I had noticed for about a week it seemed to be clear of some cats, but after that, it was a field day!"
1,DO NOT WORK!!!,Hello.I tried this product and found out this DO NOT WORK AT ALL AT LEAST WITH DOGS!!!!. What waste of money. Unfortunately i cannot return the product. I'm still having problems with the dogs in front of my balcony. Does anyone know i REALLY GOOD product to keep away dogs? Thanks
1,Does nothing to deter dogs,"This product does nothing to deter my dogs from digging in the lawn. They smell it and quit digging for an hour or so, then they start up again. It's a waste of money. Am going to try Liquid Fence, as they have better reviews."
5,This is the best series ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"I used to live in Hong Kong, and a lot of people there love Diadem. I have read all six books in the series, and I really love them. I think John Peel should write more. I don't live in Hong Kong any more, and it is really hard to get books here. I don't know what else to say, but you should definetly read these books!"
5,Incredible!,"Even though I never saw this DVD,I have a taped video of the special right here in my house. Once I taped it,it was awesome! DVD or not,watch it!"
1,Elvis by the Presleys,"It was Okay, I think it should have had more Lisa andless Priscilla. Elvis and Priscilla were divorced and shedoes have a boyfriend and son, which she never mentions. Ithink she don't want to give up the Presley name. It seemedinstead of talking about Elvis, Priscilla was defendingherself from all the stories that have been told about her.She said she divorced Elvis because you can't serve twomasters, and it was for the baby. Yeah right, she was livingwith Mike Stone in an apartment. She forgets, People remember!When they sat down at the table, Priscilla was in Elvis'chair. I think they should have left it empty, and at theend Lisa should have said the last song was the one Elvisfinished his concerts with and went to the empty chair.Lisa should have been hosting the show, not her mother."
4,Sega GT: another worthy addition to your Dreamcast library,"I'll be honest: I'm not into most racing games because many of them just don't appeal to me for one reason or another, but Sega GT is an exception. The graphics are pretty good, nothing revolutionary here, but very adequate. The game runs very smoothly and luckily, there are no irritating pop-ups, with the backgound and buildings gently coming into view as to not distract too much. The one thing that is great about this game is its use of lighting effects; everything is rendered beautifully and looks gorgeous. However, the one negative is that the controls are a bit sensitive and you have to get used to that, so a lot of practice is needed to truly master the game. The first time I played this game I wasn't all that thrilled because it does have a high learning curve, but then after you really sit down with it, you begin to appreciate its beauty. Sega GT offers a very realistic driving experience that will make you come back for more!"
4,So addicting . . .,"This is one of the best games ive ever played on sega dreamcast. You get to get some nice cars (and some ... ones) and you can ... them out. This means upgrade and ad parts and engine, and even get nicer rims!! There are two cons to this game: 1. you cant make the apearence of the car better besides the rims. 2. you can drive your beast into ne thing and it will stay in showroom condition. I really like the reality of racers where you can damage your car like in Need For Speed for the PC, but other than those two things, this game is exelent.So buy it!!!!"
4,"Dorothy Jordan, the real woman","Dorothy Jordan has claimed her part in history in two ways: her talent as a stage actress and her connection with Prince William, the future king of England. Looking back, it is hard to say which gave her higher notoriety, or which lead to her fame. This is a sympathetic but realistic potrayal of this very interesting woman. She is presented as a real person as opposed to a legend, with the shortcomings and endearing qualities of a real individual. The character comes through as being ahead of her time, a financially independent, talented, ambitious, yet compassionate, loyal and honest woman who loved her children, and the men in her life. For those who want to find out more about Mrs Jordan, this book is for you..."
2,Misleading photo- not 3 but 1 mustard,Why show a picture of 3 mustards when you only get one. Real easy-- just take a picture of the one. Should have read the reviews.
2,Only one type of mustard!,The page does not specify that only ONE jar of ONE type of mustard will be sent! Would have been better off buying at a food store for the price paid for just ONE jar!
3,The clock is a little bit bulky and the chain is already broken,The clock is a little bit bulky and the chain is already broken. It was easy to fix it but I would have expected more.
4,Nice watch.,"AS promised this watch arrived brand new, in the Fossil box with all the tags on it. Watch was double in price than most Fossil watches."
1,Out of sight,"The Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven & Hell - Live at Wacken DVD has not arrived as of today, Saturday, June 16, 2012. Happy Father's day!"
1,Where's the BLU RAY!!!!!,This concert was recorded in 2009 and there is no Blu Ray version available??? What a crying shame!!!! It is a ripoff!!!
3,its ok for the price,its an ok mattress pad...though it easily fits most thick mattresses...it does make an annoying noise everytime to climb into the bed.
4,"Good book, but mom has twins",Good book for the toddler set that watches Dora and adding a baby to the family. My daughter really likes the book and it does have the same interactive element the TV show follows. One caution is that Dora's mom has twins at the end of the book and if you're only preparing for one baby in your family that could be a little confusing!
4,Great intro to the theodicy (evil) problem,"I used this book in a seminary class on theodicy along with two other books. By far, Inbody does the best job at presenting the many ways to look at evil in God's creation. Especially interesting was how the book takes views of evil and demonstrates how this defines our view of God. Some of the definitions were uncomfortable at best and really made me think about my belief in an all-knowing, all-powerful God. A definite weakness is the abrupt movement to the concluding chapter (the author told me his editor cut out the next-to-last chapter to make the book shorter). Inbody is definately coming from a process theology view in this book, but does so in a wonderful, fair, and comprehansive way. It's the first time I really saw much value in process theology."
2,Outdated and overpriced,"This product is extremely outdated and overpriced. It can be found at many other outlets in the $20 range. The only wireless encryption available within the firmware have been compromised (wep and wpa-psk tkip) and Netgear has not released a firmware update for this hardware since April 2005. It appears they have given up on the product. Be careful, do not buy this apparent end-of-life product, especially for the ""special"" price of at least 60 bucks Amazon is wanting. It has been available for 20-25 dollars for over a year now."
1,Too many problems--unreliable,"I purchased this print server to work with my Canon and HP printer. After a somewhat counter-intuitive setup, I got it to work with the Canon, but it wouldn't work with the HP Laserjet 1012--which is a very common laser printer. I tried different drivers, configurations, settings, etc. The printer would either print gibberish or fail to print altogether.The product doesn't include software to work with Apple computers, but it would be possible to set a printer up through Windows and share it out to the macs.I returned this and bought a Linksys printer server that worked fine with the HP printer.Unless you are very technical and want to work through a frustrating setup, avoid this one."
2,Worked great... to start!,"Started out great... easy to setup, no problem printing from my laptop, now i have to unplug the power to reset it every time I want to print anything!!"
2,Works when it wants to,"As with some of the other reviews, the print server has to be power cycled on a regular basis. When printing, we listen intently for the sound of the printer starting up. If we don't hear it within a minute we know the server is down again. I've updated the firmware as well as replaced my wireless router (not to solve this problem, just an upgrade) and still the problem persists. Invariablly, all the print jobs will get stacked up unless we get up and walk into the room with the printer to unplug the power and restart it. Then it works. This happens about 30% of the time. I write this as I search Amazon for a new print server to replace this one."
3,Didn't work as expected,"Perhaps it's just me (this is the first time I've tried a wireless print server), but I didn't realize that it also serves as your wireless access point (talking to your wireless router) for your PCs. This seemed very awkward to me, and didn't work as well as I expected (another point of interference for the internet connection, and seemed to act funny when printing). It also didn't work with one of my printers, but they do warn against that and have a website to check this, so while I can't really complain about it, it does impact usability of the server."
2,Great book but DON't BUY IT ON KINDLE,"The maps and glossary to Will Self's amazing invented language are critical to the story. They are poorly scanned and blurry. The glossary is difficult to read and the maps are actually impossible. Some of the transliterations from futuristic cockney to written word were just wrong. For example ""ol'"", a dialect pronunciation for ""whole"" appeared on Kindle as the numeral ""61."" This particular error happened with several words. I only discovered it because in my frustration to understand what Self was writing I got ahold of a hard copy text and tracked down the words.It is frustrating to read such a remarkable book and be unable to access the tools and even some of the language. Get a hard copy. Don't buy it on Kindle."
1,Ordered twice - the watch did not work both times,"Ordered twice - the watch did not work both times, the first one and the replacement one. I don't know whether it did not have any battery or a dead battery but the hands refused to move."
4,great book for non-specialists,"This books provides a great survey of the movement from classical to formal mathematics, physics, and logic in the twentieth century, as well as giving a good overview of the major players in the drama and their ideas. Definitely go into this with a little bit of background, though - towards the end, it's not what i would call for the faint of heart, but if you really want to know about the subject, you're manage to plow through. And while I don't necessarily agree with Omnes's conclusions, he definitely provides some good food for thought."
3,The story line flounders to fill time slot.,"The potential for the storyline is good, but because The Outer Limits is a one hour time slot the story line had to be 'fluffed' to fill all four 'acts'. There are incongruencies in the character's actions and it appeared to me as though a half an hour story was stretched to meet the needed hour slot. This was a short-short story that had to be elongated to fit into the series. I loved the appearence of a very young 'Dick' Dawson i.e. Richard Dawson of 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Family Feud' fame. Also Comissioner Gordon of 60's TV Batman fame."
3,my review of Publisher,"I'm finding it a little difficult to do what I want - I want to create my own designs, and the stock designs are not what I want. I found one that I am using for my business cards, but is there a way to make up my own? Also, I just haven't had time to get on and learn all there is to learn about the program, so that is my fault."
1,A loser in every way,"Don't let the starring of anthony hopkins fool you, he's only in this movie for a short scenario......you'll spend the movie watching for him, and he's there and then he's gone. The rest of the movie is filled with unknowns or little seen actors you may or may not even know.....the movie tries for high spiritual lessons......it's 2 hours of your life you can never get back. Skip it and move on."
3,360 is OK,This movie was interesting in that the characters were interconnected & there were surprises. I enjoyed it. The acting was great.
2,"Some nice upgraded features, but major headaches added","A little known aspect of this product is the fact that Autodesk will only allow LT to plot one drawing at a time (except for dwf files). This is a MAJOR hinderance. The layer command is slow and sheetsets and fields are unable to be created. The old LT versions were basically 3d disabled, now the drafting features are being removed/disabled as well. If your going to spend the money get autocad full or look for another product, we are very unhappy with this change, especially how it was not very well publicized and we didn't find out until we purchased enough for multiple offices and had it installed."
2,Filters not same size as original manufactured,Filters barely fit into furnace. Will be difficult to remove since they are larger than original manufactured one. Could be a problem when replacing since they could tear and leave residue inside the furnace which in turn could damage furnace. Will not purchase these again since the actual size was not the same as the original ones.
1,sounds like too much medical advice,"I would rather go see my doctor because I think just doing things as said in this book could be dangerous and goes against what my doctor says to do, so I think you should always see your doctor before changing what you do."
3,This band is great but,"the recording on this record is terrible! Where was this recorded? A concrete bunker? A tin can? Behind a three foot wall of mud? If you want to know how this band should sound, listen to Source Tags. The recording on this one almost kills it. I really do dig this band though and these songs would be great.."
5,last man out,this book should get 10 stars. all the vn books i have read have been terrific....this one is the best to date for me...parker is the man....thanks for your sacrifice... s heinz..qui nhon 68/69
5,Great read,Very well written. We will never fully understand what it was like to be in he Vietnam War (unless you were there) but this is some great insite into what the soldiers went threw and felt. I purchased it for my son who was and is thinking of going into the military to give him some information about what he should expect. I feel better knowing that he will at least know what to expect and not to join thinking it is like a vidoe game or movie. Good buy and good read.
1,Kee MacFarlane,"It is unbelievable that this woman has actually been allowed to publish in the field of child psychology. She ruined the careers, and nearly demolished the lives of innocent people-look up ""The McMartin Preschool"" case. This psychotic woman led children into giving false testimony against innocent people, the McMartin family, several of whom were elderly. She should be banned from contributing to the child psychology field for what she did, preying on innocent people. Watch the film ""Indictment,"" which is an accurate depiction of the McMartin Preschool trial, based on false allegations, which Kee MacFarlane was responsible for starting by leading children to lie about about being molested."
1,L.A.'s opinion,"I live in the L.A. area and saw this trial un fold. kee macfarlane was the main instigator against the Mcmartins. raymond buckey spent 5 years in LA co. jail awaiting trial. macfarlane claimed to be a psycotherapist but, had no license or training. her techniques were bizarre and later discounted as being suggestive and leading. as far as the book, ""steps to healthy touching"", I wouldn't read it if it was free."
4,Quite interesting,"This book was quite interesting. It's about a young Finnish girl who learns about life, love, and sex. She struggles with finding who she is in the world and what place sex and love have in her life. She ends up getting hurt by a man-not only through physical abuse, but also emotional turmoil. But she determines to continue with her life. She understands that she wants more than just sex from a man. She feels empty inside. She realizes, with some help from her grandmother, that SHE is the one who has prevented herself from fully living and enjoying her life with her good friends and family. She decides to try love again with a new man. The ending is ambiguous, which leaves the rest of the protagonist's life in the readers hands. Readers can decide whether or not she will conquer her fears, self-doubt, etc. and be able to live her life and be confident in who she is as a human being."
2,It's just not very good...,"I have no Spoon history so I think that unlike most reviewers I have no preconceptions about liking or disliking the record... I just don't like it.After several full listens, I find the songs sounding amateurish and weak. The tunes that I think are supposed to rock (Jonathan Fisk) never really do, and the ones that are supposed to come off as perhaps more meaningful or introspective (Paper Tiger) never succeed in hooking me in. I like two and three-chord songs as much as the next person but these just don't have enough else to them to really deliver.Instead of comparing this one to other Spoon albums or even albums from other ""indie rock"" bands try comparing this to good albums from any genre. With this approach I think that you'll agree that Spoon's Kill the Moonlight is just not very good."
3,Nice compendium of basic information,"As with all of the Osprey books, I find the combination of hard fact and imaginative reconstruction drawings very helpful. This Osprey is especially useful in conjunction with two other Osprey Warrior volumes that cover other military men of the period, namely, Norman Knight and Viking Hersir."
3,Get What You Pay For,"When you buy a $5 car, you get a $5 car. Didn't steer well and you best be close to it to run it."
5,Harmonica,Very good sound and quality at a great price for kids. Even comes with a case and cleaning cloth. Most fancy cheap harmonica I've ever seen.
4,Walk at Home Fast Start,"My wife was wanting the Leslie Sansone American Heart Association workout DVD, but settled for this instead. She found the workout to be a little faster than she wanted it to be. Still a good workout video, as are all of Sansone's videos."
5,NFL Greenbay Packers Towels,"This is an awesome product, very nice sewn on lettering and decals. Made a great Birthday Gift.. Great Price too.."
2,No real purpose,"964 Pinocchio is an acquired taste. If you like movies that are wierd just to be wierd, you might like this. It really has no narrative structure and is nothing more than a series of disjointed scenes strung together for ninty minutes. The plot concerns an underground manufacturer of sex androids, one is let out and is befriended by a street person. After the first ten minutes, all real structure is thrown out and it turns into an arty student film with massive jump cutting, grotesque imagery, etc. I admit, it held my interest just to see what strange things would happen next, but overall, I wasted my time. I bought it, you should rent it-you will only need to see it once, if at all."
3,Too many insignificant details... not enough horses,"I love good horse stories, but this was not one in my opinion. Lots and lots of words spent on details that really didn't matter, made the story drag for me, and there wasn't near enough true horse detail. I struggled through the whole book but was quite disappointed. The love scenes were very watered down. I get the feeling the author has dabbled in horses but does not know them in depth. The most glaring error being the American girl who gushes on about showing ""Standardbreds"", when by a few other comments it becomes apparent she must mean SADDLEBREDS."
2,Watch Crystall Fogs Up,The price was good but I guess you get what you pay for. The watch crystal fogs upfrom the moisture in your skin when you wear it.Stu
5,How to tell apart Franklin Library editions of Madame Bovary,Franklin Library 1979 - Faux Leather binding. Brown binding with gold detail. See image: [...]Flat spine with three raised bands. No ribbon market. Brown patterned endpaper (not moire or marbled).
4,Great for the pool,We bought 3 of these at first and then loved them so ordered 3 more. These are better quality than the comparable ones we got at Target. Perfect for the pool! They aren't water tight so I don't recommend dropping them in your pool but they do float well. The construction is nice and doesn't feel cheap. I have only tried these with ice cold drinks in searing 110F Vegas weather and it works like a charm - keeps the drinks cool. These also come in nice vibrant colors so highly recommended for the summer!
5,All Of Buck's Best Hits!,"Buck Owens and his famous band The Buckaroos not only had a major impact in Country music but also in Rock n' Roll too.With his hugely successful 'Bakersfield Sound' Buck achieved an impressive amount of hits throughout the 50's,60's and 70's.This collection includes all the big hits such as I've Got A Tiger By The Tail,Together Again,Waitin' In Your Welfare Line and Love's Gonna Live Here.Other classics include Act Naturally,Cryin' Time,Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass,Johnny B Goode plus his two Bluegrass-inspired songs Ruby(Are You Mad) and Rollin' In My Sweet Baby's Arms.Buck's classic Bakersfield sound kept country radio close to it's roots during a turbulent time and his songs still live on today.This fantastic collection is a must have for any true country music fan.You can't go wrong with this gem..."
4,Good for the price,"If you already have some weights and want more, than these will do just fine. they are bigger than my old steel weights but that is not really an issue. Good for the money, and free super saver shipping!"
4,Bar Bell Weight Set,"Product purchased from Amazon.1- very good price, 2- items seem to be well made, The bar is 2 pieces which connect easily but once connected do not come apart,this could be a drawback if the set (bar) needed to be shipped anywhere or over time the connection fails.Main things I wanted to know prior to purchase was total weight and cost. Much less expensive than at local stores.I do not know if additional weights are avaliable to add on later if wanted.Basically it's a good product and I am satisfied as I use it daily to exercise.I'm 74 years young, 180 lbs and in reasonably good health so by all means all you older, overweight, couch potatoes buy a set andstart working out if you want to keep your ladies happy. It's cheaper than Viagra."
3,It is okay,"I am female and I really only need (2) 2.5, 5, and 8 pound weights. 31 pounds is really the most I want to lift, these weights offered here are much too big and you can only change them up or down by 16 lbs minimum, that is too much weight!!! So I don't recommend this weight set for girls. I never use the 20 lbs and only one 10 lbs. It was a great price but not worth it.They are made in the USA, which is sweet."
1,DO NOT BUY UNLESS SERIOUS BUGS HAVE BEEN FIXED!,"Though I just finished installing 30 other programs on my computer without a problem, VERSION 15 of THIS PROGRAM NOT ONLY CRASHED on my Windows 98 computer, but IT CRASHED MY HARD DRIVE and TOLD ME I NEED TO REINSTALL MY OPERATING SYSTEM! When I contacted their tech support, I was told there had been many calls from people having similar problems, and that I needed to not only download and install fonts, but had to download and install 4 OTHER UPDATES, including Internet Explorer, even though this computer would not be connecting to the Internet! If you do not know how to fix problems this program causes, do not buy this product unless they have fixed these fatal bugs!"
4,Casio women's watch,"The watch is light, don't even notice that you are wearing it, and it keeps good time. It's very small, and the band could be a little longer and more substatial. The watch falls off in the shower because of the length and size of the band. But it's a very inexpensive watch, so what can you expect?"
3,Good selection of okay recordings,"This disc contains many wonderful pieces of classical music and operatic choruses, but the quality of the recordings leaves something to be desired. It's a great disc for someone who's just starting into classical music or who doesn't want to go much beyond a few ""collections"" CDs, but I wouldn't buy it if I only wanted it for a specific piece - there are better recordings of each available, mostly separately."
5,Ready for another ONE!,"I received this book as a Christmas gift and I could not put it down. It truly would make an ""action-packed"" movie. Characters were realistic and believable. Fantastic Writing."
3,Not that Great,At first i was very excited about the topic. But the book doesn't deliver.Maybe good for a second grader... some illustrations o.k. but i had a problem with the artist description of the soldiers... some illustrations make the warriors look like old men in pampers... all the warriors are depicted as oldsome biased eurocentric...
2,Not Funny at All and I'm a Fan,"Seriously disappointed. I think I ""chuckled twice""...if that! Harvey falls into that trap many comedians often do...use cussing and vulgarity to mask unoriginal content. He sounded more like DL Hughley than Steve Harvey! So if you like the DL brand of comedy..have at it. Nothing clever or original in his material."
5,Hilarious!,"I had seen the edited PG version on Comedy Central, and wanted to share it with my sister. She called me half way through watching it to tell me how much her family was laughing at it. She said that they had to keep pausing it to recover and mop up their tears! Now whenever we go over there, we watch it again. It never gets old."
1,Be Warned of the Profanity...,"I watched Steve Harvey's DVD, ""Don't Trip, He Ain't Through With Me Yet"" and it was hillarious! Good, clean, funny. Then I ordered this one, ""Still Trippin"" and was serious disappointed! Within the first minute of the DVD you hear the profanity. If you're a Christian or a person who is offended by a lot of profanity then don't buy this one."
1,Doesnt work,"I received the disc in secure package, with the standard cellophane and security package. There was no damage to the box or case. There are no scratches on the disc either. Yet the disc doesnt work at all. It just reads disc error. First time ever something didnt work from Amazon."
4,very good and on point,Steve Harvey is one of my all time favorite Comedians. i have always dug his takes and he cracks me up a whole lot. he is very versatile and keeps it moving. he doesn't miss a beat. he ain't lost a thing and he keeps it real.he is far more funnier than that kermitt the frog jive turkey Katt Williams.kevin hart can't hang with Steve Harvey on stage either.
5,I love it!,"I got this book from the library, and now I'm about to order it its so good. In the starting its kind of stupid...because they fall in love almost emediantly.But after wards its almost perfect! Its very unique in that there maried threw most of the book so thats nice because usually books end were he asks her to marry him and....The End But this ones different! Mrs.Chaiken has a talent for writing fasinating books were there all diferent but you can tell there written by the same person.I love it"
2,Great pies - arrived stale though,"I've always enjoyed moon pies. I thought I was getting a pretty good deal from amazon when I ordered this box. When it arrived, I realized why: they were stale..."
5,Great dresses for photography studio work,"I purchased 3 of these dresses, 1 of each color to use in my photography studios(1st) The models love the way they fit, and look in them(2nd) The one size fits all is perfect for photography studio work(3rd) Would love to buy even more of them in different colorsI posted a photo of model Starr in the Lime Green version of this dress"
3,Good all-rounder,I like this book but it is not my favourite palmistry text. It certainly covers many aspects of palmistry in a humorous and memorable way but I would probably recommend it to someone who has been studying palmistry for a few years.
5,Not really for idiots,"Robin Gile has presented an excellent introduction to the art of palmistry, well laid out and very informative. It has many very good illustrations. It also has sound information for the professionals. His work on the fingers is some of the best I have read and I have about 150 books on the subject. The lesson plans are well laid out. I have a few professional disagreements over nomenclature, but these do not detract from the information to be gleaned from the work. Any good library on Palmistry must include this work."
4,Another good Iain Banks novel,"I've read most of Iain Banks's novels, and enjoyed all of them (that is, all of the ones I've read). He has great writing style - no cliches, good turns of phrase, lifelike characters, and lots of interesting ideas. This book's relatively straightforward compared to the others, with a pretty simple plot, but still enjoyable. I particularly liked the ending. So, four stars!"
5,Excellent film about spiritual revival happening in Fiji,As a missionary who recently came from Fiji it was great to see a film that told a little of the history. Not just what I heard from the locals
1,Worst book I have ever read,"I love reading, but I hate reading this book. It is trite and inane. If T.A.Barron cut the book down to one chapter, you would lose nothing of importance.This book is repetitive and worthless. It uses weird stories in the beginning of each chapter. ""I did this, then you did this. You were a hero and rescued me."" What is that all about?The only satisfaction I got from the book is when I burned it, while ironically reading Fahrenheit 451."
5,Great product.,"This cap was a replacement for one that came with my bike. I like the universal fitment and the fact that I don't have to take my key out to gas up. The cap is a universal fit for the Vortex base and while my base was a chrome unit, I chose the black lid to match the rest of my bike. I love this product and Amazon had the lowest price listed in my search."
5,My thoughts on the Bible,"Uh, folks, this is the Word of God!!! I would recommend that everyone, I repeat, EVERYONE, should read and follow it. It'll get you to Heaven. If you miss Heaven, then you've just missed all there is!"
1,Defective - did they ship me a return?,"The beater that came out of the box was not burnished and shiny as shown, but almost black and when I touched it, left a dark powdery substance on my hands. Clearly unfit for food, I have no idea what on earth they've sent me! It is NOT what is shown, not what I ordered, and a total disappointment."
1,Burnished or just plain BAD?,"I purchased two of the ""burnished"" blades for my KitchenAid mixer. After one run through the dishwasher, the blades blackened. They also had tiny white spots that felt like bits of salt. We've had to hand-wash the blades to get this residue off. I am unsure if the discoloration and white bumps are just unsightly or harmful, so I am returning the blades."
5,A healthy dose of military aviation insights.,"You may recognize Clyde Edgerton's name: he's written eight previous novels but here provides a compelling saga in SOLO: MY ADVENTURES IN THE AIR, a biographical memoir which provides the true account of his flying experience, from Air Force training and combat missions in Vietnam to his own personal plane. The joy Edgerton holds for planes and flying shines from every chapter: any with an affection for planes will love this celebration of flight, which holds a healthy dose of military aviation insights.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Good read as a historical type true to life book,"This gave me a personal view of life during the dust bowl. After watching the Ken Burns special on the subject, this seemed to be a good way to experience a bit of what the poor Americans went through during that horrible draught."
3,"Good, but just the hits","I liked the CD, but only for ""Frozen,"" and ""Ray of Light"" I still think it was a worthwhile buy though. Ray of light is the BEST SONG!"
5,VIVA MADONNA!!.....,"Madonna's latest Album stands for itself: an outstanding change from Evita to the upcoming millenium. Her sound is very fresh an perculiar. There are great dance tracks like 'Sky fits heaven' or the unique 'Frozen' but also tender ballads are on it like 'Substitute for love'. My favourite is 'To have and not to hold'-try it, it sounds like walking on clouds..."
4,Over 3 Years now..,"For over 3 Years now, and this albums still spins in my CD Player.from the time Underworld/Substitute for love starts till Mer Girl ends.If you still haven't bought this album, You're missing out alot."
4,Madonna's Ray of Light!,"Madonna has been around for almost three decades which is hard to believe. I remember when she first came on the music scene with Borderline and the rest is musical history. With the recent and sudden passing of Michael Jackson, Madonna even paid homage during one of her concerts to his memory which I thought it was touching.Madonna's Ray of Light is above average but not excellent but she keeps trying and recording. Her songs here are fine but not groundbreaking anymore. She has broken a lot ground during her career and there is not much left. As a mother and wife, Madonna has matured and so has her musical inclinations. She is a solid performer and can dance as well as sing a tune. The collection of songs here are mixed and no two are really alike."
1,please this music is so not madonna,i absolutly hate this cd i mean she used to have such good music .then she had a baby and her music all changed now her music makes me want to throw my radio. why would anyone like this music if i could have given her a 0 i would have. madonna go back to your old music when you were cool.
1,The very best -and worst- of electronica,"Boy, what a pile of dung. All of it. I fully agree with all the electronica fans who rated it as garbage.Oh, hold on a second: I just remembered, all of electronica sucks, every single ""song"" or whatever electronica is.So let me rephrase my critic: this album is a great, perfect example of today's electronica."
4,Excellent cd new direction (grouth),I love madonnas music she continues to grow as an artist. this cd is great but i do think it takes a step back from erotica madonnas best album to date. in erotica madonna constantly pushed the envelope. ray of light is great but doesnt push peoples butrtons.
4,Impressive,"I like this album, I never really listened to Mads b4...Evita was bad. But most of the songs on here are really cool. My faves are:Frozen, Ray of light, Little Star, Power of Goodbye and Drowned World/Substitute for Love. Her voice is impressive and the music is really differnt to nething I've heard before, or since. I look forward to hearing her next album...GO MADS!!!"
3,The Power of Good-bye,I am not the worlds biggest madonna fan or anything...I mean I like her music but the one song 1 song on her new album I absolutely love is the Power of Good-bye. This song puts me in the best mood....Im not realyl sure why but I just love it!
2,Disappointing!,"While it should be credited to Madonna that she has proven to be very versatile and often tries something new, this time she didn't really hit the bull's eye. A couple of songs (mainly the hit singles) on this album are pretty okay but the rest is really horrifying. This overly electronic music makes you nervous! There are many better albums in Madonna's rich opus. The best about this one here is the pictures in the booklet. So if you care about the music, you better buy another Madonna CD!"
1,"Been There, Done That","Madonna has pulled up the sounds, beeps and bleeps from 80s techno and tries to pass it off as new. Pet Shop Boys? Communards? Erasure? Sounds like them but the thin voice is obviously pure Madonna with a shallow New Age twist."
5,The Power Of Madonna!!!!!!!,"All I can say is ""The Power Of Goodbye"" is one of Madonna's best songs ever!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great dance beats,"A great album. Not only very danceable but also soothing and kinda spiritual as well. The title track is very techno and was a big hit for her. Some of the lyrics to the songs are kinda 'out-there'. Like ""Candy Perfume Girl"" for instance. I can't make head nor tail out of them. In fact a lot of her lyrics are like that. It makes me wonder if I'm missing a screw or I've gone dyslexic or something. But at least the music is great so it doesn't matter so much. In fact, ""Shanti/Ashtangi"" is sung in Sanskrit, and even though it has the English translation, I'm darned if it makes sense. But all in all, this is an album that most Madonna fans will love. And 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and lots of photos."
4,A very good pop record.,"I can't understand the people who gave ROL only a star. True the album does tend to drag at times but it is miles better than the other pop stuff comming out right now - Backstreet Boys et al. The title track, Nothing Really Matters, Little Star are pop gems and even though I bought this album over a year ago it still sounds as fresh as ever. If you want to listen to an unchallenging but intelligent pop album you've found one with Ray of Light."
2,Familiar music with a new twist,"Much has been made of Madonna's recent ascention into the realm of enlightened spiritual goddess via a trek to India. Far from raising her lyrics to a new level, Madonna's newfound spirituality has instead made her songwriting incessantly annoying. Songs like ""Nothing Really Matters"" and ""Drowned World"" are examples of the kind of self indulgence that is intolerable even from the woman who invented the concept. And the music, while certainly listenable, contains familiar sounds and melodies wrapped in Orbit's new wave and rave foil. Madonna's voice is pipe-cleaner thin, perfectly suited to the lyrics she weaves. All these elements add up to a Grammy favorite that will appease most fans and may even earn Madonna some new ones. But true dance music fans will only respect the album's title cut and the sole sex-romp ""Skin."""
5,Got me.,"Let's just say that I'm a long-time alterna-techno fan who has made a living poking fun at mainstream music. Intrigued by the possibility of an electronic Madonna album (I always did like that Vogue video (and others)), I bought it. I'm not sorry. It's incredible."
2,A very interesting cd.,Madonna has done a fair job at capturing what is happening in clubs and making it go pop! Consumers who are clueless to underground trends will appreciate this cd.
1,I can't believe people like this!,"Something is truly wrong with the world when critics and people are praising this album. Madonna jumps on another bandwagon, and makes a fool out of herself. This is NOT electronica, and if you don't like this album, don't let it deter you from checking out the good stuff like Fluke, Crystal Method, Underworld, Photek, etc. , as all of it is much better than this boring pop junk.Everything Madonna has done in the past has always been incredibly cheesy, with some of the worst lyrics this side of the Backstreet Boys. The critics are absolutely wrong - don't waste your time or money on this awful disc, unless you are looking for an expensive coaster."
1,What?,"Last year I really liked the song ""Ray of Light,"" so I tried this album. All of a sudden it seemed as if ""Ray of Light"" was being played too much on the radio. Also, I never really liked ""Frozen."" The only song I liked on the whole album was ""The Power of Good-Bye."" I realized that this album wasn't worth my time. I really wanted to like this album, but I just couldn't listen to the rest of it. I finally sold it to a used CD store today."
2,"Good album, bad attitude","I have grown up listeing to Modonna ever since lucky star nad Borderline I have idolized her ...until i saw her attitude, yes this album is her best yet, her vocals are beter than any other album and her lyrics are too. This is my favorite album by her however, it is not origional, Bjork is the starter of this trend anyway, I saw on the MTV awards and for her to say ""many people don't impress me"" is so ridiculous b/c shes been around a long time and has surely created a name for herself but there are people more talented than she for example, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Tina Turner, Aretha ect. so for her to say that is just dopey. However I love Madonna and thsi album is her best work yet."
4,Another change...for the best!,"If there is one thing you really cannot blame the woman for, is the lack of changes.Again she surprises the world with a different music style.This album was widely conceived with british ambient producer William Orbit.FROZEN is damn good, full of dark atmosphere and with a counterpunction of orchestral elements against a synthesizers arrangement.Romantic and haunting at the same time...RAY OF LIGHT turns to the rock side, great guitar riff.NOTHING REALLY MATTERS and SKY FITS HEAVEN are dancefloor-oriented.THE POWER OF GOODBYE is what you'd call a ballad once it is set in this type of project.And just to remind you of the new spiritual journey she undertook, here she goes singing the praise of her new-found religion in SHANTI-ASHANTI.If you can't be any more surprised than listening to Madonna singing it, then you run out of love for music."
5,This game rules,In the past I'v played games such as Trickstyle for dreamcast street Sk8ter for playstation and many others and im being totally honest when i say that none of those games even come close to Tony Hawk Pro Skater. With the games wide variety of characters levels boards and oh so awesome tricks this game is endless hours of fun.
1,Cheap piece of junk.,"This is a review written after 3 years of ownership. This printer is an over priced piece of garbage. I've owned 3 of them. Canon replaced it several times under warranty. I print very rarely and the printer is used on the desktop and never moved. Every time I needed to actually use the printer (once a month) it was clogged or the ink had dried up. 30 minutes needed to be spent hooking it directly to a computer to perform maintenance and figure out what was wrong. Finally, last night when I really needed it, the black print head died all together. I took the thing out and washed it by hand with alcohol and water. Scrubbed it raw. Pleaded with it. Screamed at it. It still wouldn't print black. I have a $250 brick sitting in my cabinet now. My next print with cost a lot less and have lasers in it and no clogging parts. Canon can kiss my print head."
2,had to return it,"i bought this item for my son, thinking he could take it when he travels. however, it was too big and heavy and i had to return it. he said if it also faxed and copied, it might be worth packing, but not for just a printer. i'm sure it's a nice home printer, but just didn't fill his needs."
4,Great little printer,"I was thoroughly impressed by the quickness and clearness of print. The printer can be lugged anywhere to use. The printer cartridges are used quickly, so make sure buy double the printer cartridges when printing a lot."
5,Big fan of this classic comedy!!,I've loved The Three Stooges since I first saw re-runs of this show when I was about 7 years old. I still watch it on Antenna TV (a channel that pretty much airs old episodes from shows way back in the day). I prefer watching episodes that feature Shemp but I also like Curly's episodes too *Curlys laugh*Highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves watching The Three Stooges featuring Shemp Howard. Plus this DVD has like 3 episodes in 3D and comes with a pair of 2 3D green and purple glasses. Enjoy!
5,Top-notch!,A Christmas gift for my son who was thrilled. This completed his Three Stooges' collection.
5,Dad is loving it,"Got this as a gift for my dad, and he sure does love it. All of the collections are amazing except for Volume 8, I didn't get that because of ''curly joe''. No thanks."
4,"Struggle, Hope, Endurance and Progress","This book is absolutely fascinating and was difficult to put down. I am no bookworm by any sense of the term, but I found myself chewing through pages like a madman. The last few chapters were somewhat slow when compared to its bulk. What the Donner Party went through is simply amazing. Our society today has absolutely no clue of what survival or courage means. Its a tragedy this stuff is no longer taught in school -- a true pioneer classic. This is a must read."
3,Misleading product image,"*** Note this review is only with regard to the product image on Amazon.com, and not a review of the product itself. ***If you have an old X-Fire mask like me with the retention hooks on the bottom of the goggle/lens, and you actually want the lens with the holed tab for the hooks, THIS IS NOT IT. With the exception of the image for the ""chrome"" lens, all the other images show the lens with the holed tab. I can't say for the yellow or smoked lens, but I ordered the clear lens, and returned it for a replacement - both times,the lens sent to me was one that didn't have the holed tab.Now, I did write JTUSA/Kee Action Sports and they told me the hooks were more form than function. ""They were just for looks"" was the specific reply I received, so you can probably get away with using the non-holed tab lens if you want.With regard to the lens itself, it is an excellent product, as the original one from my mask lasted a long time before cracking and it never fogged up."
4,JT Thermal replacement Lens,"I bought this (about $16+shipping) for use with the JT Mask ($24.99) that I bought at Sports Authority. I have used it once and it did resist fogging through a 25 degree day of airsoft in a snow storm. It definitely worked a lot better than the standard lenses, and for the price (about $50 total, including shipping and tax, etc), was worth a shot before investing in a fancy $200 mask with a fan.Results may vary - if you tend to sweat a lot, you may see some condensate, though I still didn't get any fog. Probably not perfect, but much better than my $90 paintball mask... seems to resist scratches and dings well."
5,Just what I needed.,"I'm a big time budget player. I dont paintball as often as I would like, so I look for solid, low end deals for the casual paintballer. I ordered these lenses as a replacement for the single lens that came with my JT Elie XFire mask (its an older model mask, but has excellent coverage and a basic tactical design).These got rid of the Glare, and dont fog like the single lenses. I give the smoke lenses a 5 out of 5."
3,Hitch for a new Trailer,"The hitch came from Amazon with just marginal packagiing, but no parts were lost.The hitch is well made and has good instructions. The rated load is accurate.There is one design fault: the adjustment for setting the angle of the hitch ball bracket [ to set the spring bar load] is kept in place only by the friction of the side clamping bolts. there is no ""keeper"" to prevent the bracket angle from changing, relying on the spring bar load to hold things together. Should the hitch be used w/o the spring bars [as I do sometimes for short distances] the bracket angle can slip down letting the setup plugs fall out. I added a 1/2"" bolt to hold things together after the spring bar load is setup."
4,Tulip Fever is Hot,"Great book, Tulip Fever. Very simply written, short sentences,brief paragraphs. But the plot is thick and convoluted, set in the 1600's amidst the canals and tulip craze that valued tulip bulbs as high as that of a house at its peak. The story actually centers around a couple, with a generous near 60 year old widower and his young 24 year old bride. A portrait of the two of them is contracted for, and from that the intrigue begins. The climax is classic. Very worthwhile reading with the feeling of what it feels like to gamble on a sure-fire thing, even if it is a tulip bulb. That kind of looks like an onion or a leek. There were points in this tale where I had to stop, because the story was unnerving. But the reward was immense. As it has been said: every book you read changes your life. This one did. Especially in gaining historical perspective on a craze that will bubble off and explode..."
2,Beoordeel geen boek door zijn dekking.,"After reading such good books as ""The Girl With the Pearl Earring"" and ""Hyacinth Blue"", I'm afraid I found this book rather disappointing. I felt like I was reading a cheesy bodice ripper dressed up as an arty historical novel. Such a lovely cover too. What a pity!"
2,Good but gross,"Tulip Fever is a really good book. It would be a great book if there weren't discriptions of what they did in bed together. I read historical fiction to get an idea about what life was like back then, and the parts in bed back then are the same as now."
4,This is the second Historical fiction that I read,"I also read, Girl with a Pearl and I liked that one, but I do have to say that I enjoy this one more.It was fast moving, short chapters, and a good ending. It kept me focused for the whole story, and I read it in very short time. Who needs a brain draining book to read in the evening?I recommend this book when you need a ""break"" from the hecticlife that we call ""normal""."
4,"What happened to the ending of ""Night on the Bare Mountain""?","Overall, the album is terrific. But track 17, ""Night on the Bare Mountain"", just abruptly stops in the middle of the piece... at least it does on my copy. Has anyone else noticed this?"
2,Not sure I agree with the reviews here...,"I'm not sure I agree with the reviews here... To me, Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto is one of those strongly Russian pieces that loses a lot of its vigor if its Slavic edge is muted, as it is in this recording. Fritz Reiner conducts the orchestra with leaden overstatement, as if it were Brahms or Wagner or some other Germanic composer. Van Cliburn gives a typically energetic performance, but in my mind it lacks the Slavic edge that you hear in, e.g., Rachmaninov's own performance of the piece. It's too optimistic and not harsh enough--in short, it's too American and insufficiently Russian.To me, Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto here is even more obviously lacking. The orchestra and Van Cliburn clearly fail to play together more than once. RCA seems to have added this recording as padding to fill the CD--don't treat it as anything else."
2,Not as represented,"The primary reason I purchased this one was due to it (supposedly) being 16"" wide to cover up the hole from a removed light. It is NOT 16"" wide, more like 11 1/2"" which was quite disappointing. Due to a time-crunch, I did not go through the hassle of returning/exchanging it. Nice light though, just misrepresented."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This has got to be the absolute worst kids DVD I have ever seen. The music is horrible, the singing is a-tonal and horrendous, and the animation is hideous. If it wasn't bad enough that they butcher the classics, their original songs are completely without merit. I strongly suggest that Amazon burn its' entire stock. Do not buy this DVD.P.S. Amazon, why is there no 0 star rating?"
1,Can't say - won't play,"All of my other Amazon movies download in a snap. This one claims I own it, but it won't play. Now I have to call Amazon on the phone. Hate that."
5,Great!,It was very great and crystal clear! No buffering at all; just smooth streaming and great quality. It was definitely worth it.
3,Good Overview of How People All Over the World See God,"If you want general information as well as a non-proselytizing overview, this is a good documentary. A few celebrities are interviewed and asked about their religious experiences. Since Islam has been in the forefront of the news for the past 20+ years, more than one ""expert"" is interviewed: one a true scholar, the other a bigot. The message seems to be that most people of different faiths can co-exist peacefully with love and tolerance. If a more ""in-depth"" approach is needed, then different sources should be consulted."
4,Worth every penny and it doesn't cost a lot of pennies!,"I purchased this for my daughter who is beginning piano lessons. We have been very impressed with the sound and feel of the keys. For practicing, we use the grand piano mode. This keyboard can do so much more than we need but those extra features are a great incentive for her to practice. Practice first then play second! I find myself dabbling at this keyboard almost daily. This isn't a very technical review. But from one parent to another, feel confident that this is an excellent purchase. I'm very glad that I didn't spend $600+ on a digital piano. I recommend the Yamaha LC3 stand for this keyboard. It is not listed as an option but after calling Yamaha, they suggested it as well. It bolts to the bottom and is collapsible as well."
5,need to learn chinese and want it to be easier!,"My son is in a chinese speaking area out of the USA and he's findning these study aids as the best. He had High School chinese and one semester in college and he said these were better by far then the ones the school or the college used, they show the tone marks and make learning the break down of sounds alot easier to get right!!!! Best ones' out there! This along with a certain dictionary and you've got what you need, I'm reviewing the dictionary next... together they are the best combo, available! That includes many of the lang. programs! After buying two other sets of cards (other companies and 4 other dictionaries I wish someone had reviewed them for me and saved my cash!) Good luck!Excited Parent!"
4,Great whale Hollywood adaptation.,"Image quality was surprisingly strong, with a few imperfect passages. Many great gothic touches by Whales.Performances always entertaining, especially the bad guys."
3,Had to return my first 3170,"Upon receiving and unpacking a 3170 from Amazon, I immediately inspected the scanner glass, since any imperfection will show up on hi-res image, photo, or film scans. I found a piece of dirt or lint adhering to the underside of the glass and also a small linear scratch or stress fracture, so I repacked the scanner without ever having plugged it in. I shipped the product back to Amazon as defective and am now awaiting shipment of a replacement. I'll post a follow-up review when I've received the replacement and used it awhile. Meanwhile, if you buy a 3170 and intend to use it for hi-res image and film scanning, you might want to inspect the glass carefully when you first unpack it"
1,1 star if you use MAC OS X 10.4 (Tiger),"My 3170 worked beautifully with OS X 10.2.6 (including smart panel) Using it with 10.4.x is so klunky and so many functions do not work, I'm gonna trash it if I don't find a fix soon. At the moment it is essentially useless to me just taking up valuable desk space. Epson tech support sent me an email saying they do not officially support 10.4 but try.XYZ.it may work. I tried, it didn't."
2,Not for intel Mac Owners!,"While the hardware appears fine, let me be frank - EPSON software is useless. Clunky, crashy, and worst of all it won't even work with Adobe CS3 unless you run it in Rosetta mode.If you like the polish of function and form that comes with a mac, you will be particularly irked by the software that comes with this scanner."
3,Decent book,"This book is an ok book. Ive seen better, but I believe that you must have a THOROUGH knowledge of advanced calculus for this book. That means a very good understanding of vector calculus in 3-dimensions. My only real gripe with this Vol II version is that the book constantly refers to equations and examples in the Vol I, so if you dont have Vol I then you are missing out. Other then that I think the book does a pretty good job of explaining the concepts."
4,great t-shirt,I got a lot of compliments when I wore that T-shirt to an adoption event. I'm involved with animal rescue. Everyone liked it.
2,WAY OVERPRICED AT $155,"Ordered and received one of these direct from Wayfair and paid $104.99 including delivery. The finish is much darker than shown, there is probably $20 worth of costs to make, the unit was uneven at the base no matter where I placed it, the divider I received was broken and there was only 1 though 2 are shown. To give credit to Wayfair the first I ordered was ""natural"" and was a dark red oak finish and they were great to return and work with. I got clear which is still darker than pictured but reasonably close. The problem is that wood DVD holders are hard to find, yet at $155 this is incredibly overpriced."
4,A Fantastic Zombie Journal,"At first I wasn't too sure about this one. It is written as a journal, and usually those types of stories don't read well for me, but as he goes through his struggles day after day, trying to survive I really got into it. The journal is told by a Navy man who was on leave when the plague struck, turning almost everyone into zombies within a matter of days. As the government collapses he travels from his home in Arkansas to the coast of Texas, picking up a few stragglers along the way. Though the story is told from a military point of view it is by no means a tough guy story. This character has depth, feels remorse for the things he is having to do to survive, and often wonders if the dead aren't the lucky ones. Great story!"
1,Not as good as the other zombie novels,"**WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS!!**Of all the zombie stories I've read so far this is my least favorite. The main character is too well prepared for the apocalypse: a fortress-like home, generator, guns, food. At no time did I feel an attachment to the character or felt that he was in danger. Once he rescued the attractive co-ed and found the nuclear missile silo I completely lost interest. Also, its the first of a series so prepare to be disappointed by the ending.Skip this one and read the Morningstar series."
2,journal?,"Overall I did enjoy this book. However I feel it should have had more of a journal feel to it. It should have been handwritten, it should have had doodles in the margins, and it should have been more rambly.It was too polished. When you write a journal you aren't writing for anyone but yourself. You don't need to tell yourself about what you already know.Also, a pilot who can fly jets could easily fly a Cessna.My biggest complaint is that at the end (SPOILER) he felt bad for killing people? Its the end of the world, people are trying to get to your survival mechanism. Its kill or be killed, so if you wipe out 50 rednecks who are dumb enough to drive their fuel tanker onto your site then they deserve it.I enjoyed it, but it could have been much better."
1,Dead Awful,"Quality zombie fiction is hard to find, and you definitely won't find it here. Poorly written, laughable right wing propaganda at best; boring, shallow, pedantic tripe at worst. Save your money and check out the superior ""World War Z"" or the excellent anthology ""The Living Dead."""
5,Solid Zombie Fiction (that reads like Non-fiction),"Bourne's interpretation of the Zombie Apocalypse is hair-raising and intelligent. Unlike so many other books in this vein, the writing is solid. I actually had a nightmare after reading this, which is a testament to its quality."
5,"My personal favorite post-apocalyptic novel, zombie or otherwise.",Never drags. You won't be able to put this one down. Free time will be well spent reading this book!
5,Day by Day,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The book covers the day to day events in a navy pilots life after the Zombies attack; although I did believe that the character was obsessed with the end of the world. He seemingly had enough supplies to last him for years. I liked the grit and the misspelled words. The book created the feeling that I was reading someones journal. Which is what it intended to do. The book was a quick read I think that I finished it in about a day. I can't wait for part two.
3,A little cold,"Day by Day Armageddon is a decent book, but for me it fell a little flat. I had high expectations based on the number of raving reviews. I'm not a fan of the journal style in general, and that may have been the problem for me. It's hard to get a feel for secondary characters without any dialogue or insight into their motivation. What I really thinks holds the book back from being great is that it lacks emotion. There is great detail about all sorts of things, except how the main character feels about anything. When there is some hint of emotion, it falls flat and seems out of place. It's still a good book if you love zombies, I just can't give it my strongest recommendation."
5,Great Read!,If you are a fan of Zombie books this book is for you! I came across this book in a book store and was unsure about it but against my better judgment I took the book home anyway. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. J. L Bourne's style of writing I thought at first wouldn't be appealing to me but I feel right into place with the journal type entrees the book is compiled of. The only problem I have with the book is that it had to end. At the time of my purchase there was no notice he would be making a sequel to the series but it is now out and on my list of must reads.
4,Another Zombie Book To My Collection,"I'll make this short and sweet this was a great read. Not the best I've read but brought up some new ideas on the Zombie war. My only complaint way to short and the the middle seemed to drag along. I found my mind wondering as I was reading it. Without giving to much away, the whole time spent on the boat/dock was way to long and rambled on. But all that aside great book and can't wait to read the next after the cliff hanger ending!"
4,good solid zombie book,"The book is written in a journal format, and I found this took a little getting used to, but once I did, I read it straight through (thank God for booklights). There were quite a few grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors, but if you don't let that sort of thing get to you, you'll enjoy the book quite a bit.The storyline is very solid and follows the George Romero style of zombie tale, which I enjoy the most (slow moving, have to destroy the brain to kill the zombie, etc). The character development was a bit shallow, but not distracting. The author's ideas were quite good, and I'm looking forward to the sequel to this book, although I hope it's longer next time."
1,not worth 11.99,Very short book for 11.99. The story was not very imaginative or very detailed. Might have been a decent read for .99 but do not waste your money on this very short story. I believe most of the reviews are highly over rated.
5,A survival horror masterpiece,This book was amazing; I could not put it down once I started reading it. I have been a zombie fan all my life and it was very refreshing to see a original story that wasnt a clone of others. The problem with most zombie stories is you can predict what will happen because it happened in every other one. When I was reading this book I could not stop because I wanted to know what could possibly happen to the main character after all hes been through. I can not wait for DBDA2 to come out because I have already read this book like 5 times and its still great each time.
5,AWESOME READ!!!!!!,I went to the web link published here and read some of the novel before I purchased the work [only about 70-80 pages online]. I then ordered this book and two days later I received it via UPS and a day later I was finished with it! I can't wait for the sequel! I have to find out what happens to the survivors!!!!! Don't leave us hangin'...What a great zombie survival horror book!
4,engineers make great side kicks [no spoilers],"""Day By Day Armageddon"" begins a first person point of view series with a narration via a diary starting January 1, 2004 until nearly 6 months later. The writer details his exploits as he discovers a contagion is destroying the world's population. Both the real author and fictional character are naval officers with flight training, adding an extra dimension to the transportation possibilities. The characterization and environmental details are respectable, and the action can be rather engrossing.Having to handle the emotional stresses of being a survivor, his dry humor helps add levity (""ask the local population for help"" cracked me up). There is great potential for the series and a few open plotlines for the next book. I believe there could have been a smoother transition to the ending, it seems abrupt.I highly recommend the series to any fan of the undead genre.Thank you."
1,Dull + Flat + Boring = This Book,"Don't understand why so many people rated this 5 stars on Amazon!! Journal format makes this flat and without any dimensions at all. The author spent too many pages on preparations, finding foods, cleaning guns, looking for transports....! What's the most wanted elements in Zombies novel?? Excitement, Tension, Suspense, Dramatic!! Where is it?? Summed up there may be only 5 to 10 pages are worth reading!!The main character seems a very lucky man, when he's around the ""supposedly zombies infested streets"" there's only handful of zombies wandering. And he doesn't have to fire many shots but just out run them and always found a secure places to stay!! I don't see any point of reading this novel. Totally waste of time and money. Just pick any decent zombie movies will be a lot better than this!!"
2,Boring,"I think that there is an epidemic of over rating books on Amazon. this book was just plain boring, don't care about the characters, don't care what happens next...I gave up half way through. I want half my money back."
3,Dan Katz,"This novel wasn't bad. It was an interesting perspective seeing it from someone who didn't know what was going on other than what the news was telling him. I almost felt as though it were me preparing to hold up in my own house, as I followed him through his days. Grapping goods from the stores, boarding up the windows and doors. I had no problems visualizing what the author was writing. But I found myself getting tired of the day-by-day and wishing it was week by week. You can only be in someones head for so long... if they have a boring personality."
4,Great zombie book!,"I greatly enjoyed Day By Day Armageddon. A fun, quick read that leaves you wanting more (which, BTW, I've heard is coming or maybe already out). The thing in the water is one of the best zombie scenes I've read in a long, long time!"
2,Not worth the $$,"I can't believe what I paid for this on Kindle, when it contains errors like ""wearing a pear of jeans"" and ""applied the breaks"". C'mon, is there an editor in the house? The author does not know how to use a comma. Totally flat characters with practically no physical description, let alone personality. The pictures were nice, though."
4,Excellent book!,This was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the zombie genre.
1,awsome!,"loved it! it worked better that I expected, I can't wait to order some more. we made bath fizzies and the came out fantastic!!!"
3,"fine product, poor packaging","The citric acid arrived quickly, but was packaged poorly, so the bag broke open. The postman even left a note about it."
5,Bought this to make diswasher detergent,"I needed citric acid to make a all natural detergent for my dishwasher (it contains the citric acid, baking soda and salt, and works great!!!) This was a large amound for a good price, I think it will last me forever!"
5,"Excellent product, but...","The product is very nice, heavy and well made. My wife wanted a large mixing bowl with a lid for making homemade ice cream. This fit the bill and has worked out great. My only problem is that I saw it last weekend at Target for $9. Usually Amazon is very competive, not so this time."
5,Album of the year... and it's only April,"When I first heard that this album mixed rare groove with classic hip-hop i wasn't convinced it would gel together, but gel it does.Katalyst takes you through the records that have influenced his music and also stood the test of time.From the superb and timeless 'California Soul' by Marlena Shaw through to Run DMCs 'Down with the king' this double CD will have you moving in your seat and trying to work out what record that sample has been used on."
3,Not as good as their first,"Not as good as their first album but it's still decent, there are a few boring parts though. Mathias Blad voice is still great as it was on the self title. I give this a 3.5 out of 5, this is not a great album but it has it's moments."
3,"The research was wonderful, however...","The research was wonderful, however the writing style made it very difficult for me to get through. The content is worth the repetitions and unpolished style."
5,Great Experimental Music!,"If you are looking for a different sound, it would be hard to find sounds more different than these! This book provides a great overview of a number of very diverse experimental musical instruments. The accompanying CD is essential to illustrate the sounds and timbres, and contains some quite good music as well. Where else are you going to hear a daxophone?"
4,"works great, but won't play protected files","This player works great, but it will not play wma's purchased from the walmart downloading service (it does play unprotected wma's and mp3's without any problems). This isn't because there's anything wrong with the player, but because of the way they encode their files."
4,"good, inexpensive, kid-friendly","I bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loved it. It was easy for him to use. It was available in cool colors. It even worked great, until he dropped it in the toilet!"
5,One of my Favorites,"I really liked this book. When I first found out what it was about I thought that it was going to be boring, but I read it anyway. It was awesome. It was like you knew the character's and could relate to their problems. I would read it again and I've already read it three times. It is one of my favorite books."
5,Good Summer Book,This book was about a girl named Colie that was forced to spend the summer with her crazy aunt. Colie meets a girl named Isabelat the Last Chance Bar and Grill that teaches her to have confidence. This was just a wonderful book. I read it in one night. I could not put it down.
5,A Wonderful Self-Esteem Booster,"Keeping The Moon, by Sarah Dessen is a remarkable book. This is a perfect book for teenagers that are going through those awkard years. Anyone that has low self-esteem and low self-respect should read this book. It will help you to like yourself and let others like you in return."
4,Must have for fans,"Being a MCR fan for quite a while, I was eagerly anticipating Life on the Murder Scene. So far I have not been dissapointed. The cd has live versions of most of their songs plus a new track called Desert Song. The DVD's have their videos plus the making of and various live performances and a two hour video diary. All in all this great cd/dvd combo."
5,This was effing amazing.,"Life On The Murder Scene was absolutely amazing. I had my friend over the day it came over and we watched all of the stuff, it was great. 4 hours on the Vidio Diary and then live preformaces from various places and a live cd wich had a new song (Desert Song). I loved it. && I love MCR. Those guys are all super. You won't be dissapointed. All though I will say, the menues on the dvds were creepy, rather demented. xD whatever, I got over it quickly."
3,i cant wait,same as the other guy i have searched the internet and alternative press said it already came out but one site did say it comes out in 2010 come on!!!!!! i want it so badPs. my 3 star rating is just because this is turning into a message board so i just put that even tho the dvd is going be kick ass
1,where is it?,what the heck guys where is the anticipated album??? it was soupposed to come out today and i drove all over Georgia looking for it. When is it gonna come out?mon u cant just change the day the album is coming out the day its supoosed to oiriginally come out
3,Great Music But A Bad Title,"While I love the music of John Williams, it has nothing to do with the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey and you have to wonder why such a title is given to a collection of Star Wars related pieces of music. So I don't know how to honestly rate this album: by the music which would get a good rating or the fact that the title is so misleading which would cause me to rate it low. So I roughly split the difference but only for that reason."
1,NETGEAR FAILS,"MY WGX102 BEGAN TO FAIL ROUGHLY AROUND THE END OF THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY. WHEN IT DID FINALLY FAIL DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS 33 DAYS AFTER THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, NETGEAR WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT IN ANY WAY. UNLESS YOU'RE INTO BUYING $100 DISPOSABLE NETWORKING GEAR, AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
1,Initially Great. Now it does not work.,"When I first plugged it in it worked immediately. I had a brief, 4 minute power outage. Now it does not work at all. I have rebooted, unplugged and replugged. Nothing. The customer support response was less than intelligible to me. The device is not in use anymore."
4,Good for internet. Not good for more resource-intensive use.,"I've used the range extender with the XE102 unit for over two years now and they have always worked great for normal internet browsing. However, it is VERY SLOW (around 1 mbps) transferring files between computers, and the whole thing just crashes if I try to do something like streaming media at even a moderate bitrate. The crash is easy to fix--unplug the wireless unit, then plug it back in a few seconds later. But it is clearly a pain if the wireless unit is in another room (or in my case, on another floor).But for normal internet use, the wireless unit has always worked well -- no probs at all."
1,"Great, but unfortunately...","This thing does exactly what it's supposed to, and set up couldn't be easier. So why am I returning it? Because I left it and its' sister piece the XE102 in for only ten minutes, and when I went to remove them, they were so hot as I pulled them out of the sockets that I felt like I damn near burned my hand. Furthermore, they took an entire ten minutes to cool down! This CAN'T be a good thing. It's too bad, too, because they really work great---but not at the expense of burning down the condo."
3,Good value,This item did need some of the parts glued together to make it more sturdy. I would still buy it again.
1,Received wrong version of book!,I ordered this book recently and received another version than was pictured. Not at all happy. This is deceptive marketing.
3,Okay,"Well my daughter got these for her first bow...they have hit everything in the yard except the target and they still work fine. No damage after hitting, the fence, the garden, the shed, the playset, some retaining wall etc...Good price and quality.!"
4,Good practice arrows for beginners,"If your looking to start practicing and have zero experience, look no further. These will hold together when you miss and hit the garage door. I've had mine for about 10 months. They only just now started falling apart. Out of six, one tip broke off, 3 feathers are frayed and only 3 are in good shape. The tips tend to deform too. I got them for my dumb friends who want to shoot my bow but cant hit the broad side of a barn. No sweat off my sack if they break."
3,American DJ Par 38,Not the most solid of Par 38's. I bought them as spare lights to keep in my kit for a variety of productions (on and off stage). They arrived timely. Nothing was broken and they worked. Can't ask for much more. Good thing about most of the par 38's is that they'll take any standard light bulb.
3,"it's not that bad, its good if you like classic freestyle","i think this cd has what old school freestyle fans are looking for, songs like,""DRUMS OF LOVE"",""DESTINY""and""LOVE IN DISGUISE""Is the reason why they called this cd classic freestyle, put itthis way- this is a GOOD cd to have in your collection!!!!."
4,Good Buy,"Having bought this set on sale, I do feel as though I got my money's worth. Once thing to know is that this is a *powerful* set, too strong a vibration for some sensitive areas."
2,Failed on me,"Worked for 3 weeks, and then stopped for no reason. It turns on, but is permanantly frozen. A peice of junk. Also, there is no real user manual or software. And when it did work, it doesn't let you order your songs, it just plays whatever it feels like"
4,Great for the money. Easy to use,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He uses it at the gym. Great for the money. Easy to download songs. Sound quality from ear buds is not great, but he swapped out the headphones from his CD player. I have ""borrowed"" it so many times for walks, that I am finally breaking down and buying one for myself."
2,Rock and Ice UK offer safer instruction,Fairly good reading - but Rock and Ice offer climbing instruction that would get most people climbing in a weekend! I reccommend taking a course with them. Jump to: www.rockandice.co.uk and have a look!
2,no stopwatch,I checked the casio website. There is no stopwatch function as is claimed here.I repeat- there is no stopwatch function as is claimed here.
1,"It just works for 4 month, then goes dead.","I bought this watch from amazon in July. Now it goes dead itself. No damages, but it just stoped quietly. It is still in warranty. I am wondering if it is worth to pay for the shipment myself to send it to casio for repair, since the watch only costed me $14.45 at that time. Personally, I do not want to take my time, pay for their bad, and buy one more unhappy experience.BTW, this is my 2nd casio watch. The first one still works, it is not the one with 10-year battery. However, this one just works for 4 month and died, even though it has a 10-year battery.Do you think I should send the watch to them for repair?Thanks for your time."
3,Watch,"Good looking watch; rating it lower than ""5"" due to uncomfortable band!It never feels right on your arm..."
3,Another Curate's Egg.,"This is a very patchy CD. It has some charming moments. ""Good Morning Annya"" has a lovely feel about it. ""City of Angels"" - especially the second half - is blistering. And the steel drum arrangement of ""Giant Steps"" is beautifully psychotic. The main problem with this album is the playing of Jaco himself. Listless and uninspired. Going through the motions. The other musicians make up for it though. Especially the pianist on ""City of Angels"". Many apologies to the man but I've forgotten his name. A local Florida musician, I believe. He's the real star on this record."
1,Zero Stars If I Could.,"This album was never intended to have any bass playing on it. It was really a showcase for Jaco's skills as an arranger (his bass chops were long gone by this time), and a showcase for Jaco's long-time jam partner and friend Othello Molineaux, a stellar drummer. After Jaco's death, the idiot who possessed these tapes got some flake to play bass tracks over Othello and put it out. Jaco's family has gotten legal proceedings worked out to block this album from ever being heard (and rightly so). This guy doesn't have a blessed thing on Jaco, and even if he did, he isn't. Enough said. Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,NO DISRESPECT TO JACO,"The bassist on most of the tracks is not Jaco, it is a Jaco imitator who doesn't do too great of a job. Since he left this album unfinished someone completed it with another bassist. DON'T BUT THIS IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR JACO!!!!!!!!"
4,good overview of the battle,"Osprey does its usual excellent job in this short manual, an overview of the buildup to the battle of Kursk, the battle itself, and then a short capsule on its meaning and aftermath.Osprey's long suit has always been outstanding graphics, a wealth of detailed illustrations and pictures, and maps that you can actually use and refer to while reading the text, and this volume is up to that standard. The text itself, though short, is remarkably balanced and sober, and the battle comes to life in an almost day-by-day account once it is kicked off. Meanwhile, we get short looks at the opposing armies, strategies, leaders, and weaponry, as well as the general grand strategic situation during the summer of 1943.For a short treatment, this volume does an excellent job of getting the reader to understand generally what went on, and why."
5,great color,"this is my favorite red hair dye. the color is so vibrant, you cant find anything like it, beleive me i tried"
2,Neither virgin nor snow,It didn't do what I expected.It turned some of my white hair golden.I applied it a second time and it was no different.
3,Doesn't get White blonde,"We've tried this twice now, and despite our best efforts, cannot get it to make the hair go snow white in color. First attempt was on hair that had been colored numerous times, then used professional product to pull any remaining color out, then bleached before using this. It made the hair a bit lighter, no doubt, but definitely not white in color. Second attempt was on a head with much shorter hair where the only product ever used was the professional bleaching kit, which gave us a base start of light yellow/blond hair to put the Manic Panic on. Again, lightened the hair up but no white blonde to be seen."
2,not that great..,"shipment came in a reasonable about of time, color just didn't show up at all, I'm very disappointed that this product didn't work=/"
3,Will turn your hair light but be prepared for a little bit of purple,"This is a great product and it will turn your hair light, HOWEVER you will have bits of purple left over what will wash out in a few washes."
2,One song glory,"The only good song on this album is it's first (and only?) single, ""Just A Dream"". Written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, Madonna sings backing vocals on this track. Donna sings backup for Madonna on her concert tours, but Donna just doesn't have a strong voice. It's an ok album, but the only real gem on it is ""Just A Dream""."
3,buy only if you like to read about nutrition,"This is a review of the paperback version of this book. Author is a registered dietician. Basic recipes are a small part of the book.If you've never heard of the components of the Mediterranean way of eating and are interested in basic nutrition, you might like this reading. If you are interested in cooking, search for a cookbook."
2,Fruits and vegetables are good for everyone.,"Book is too old; information not up to date; would not purchase again due to outdated information. Overall, good initial information."
2,Did not find the diet easy to follow.,This book is not for a person that likes a diet that is simple and easy to follow. Their are recipes in the book but they are not simple. I think with people having very busy schedules they want a diet plan that has a easy menu plan and recipes with five ingredients or less.
5,amazing book on LIFESTYLE - not just food,"Tons of great advises and explanation on why things work the way they do.For example it was interesting to learn more about vitamins and why it's preferable to eat vegetables and fruits and grains vs taking supplements. It also gave me a pretty clear idea of when I should add some vitamin C into my diet instead of just blindly taking pills every day.Overall this book is about common sense and a tested lifestyle which most Americans (me including) have a hard time following. I have compared it to Okinawa food pyramid and found a lot of similarities, except Japanese also clean their bodies with antioxidants such as tea and bitter melon.Definitely recommend this book to everyone."
4,This is still great stuff!,"I haven't heard this stuff in decades, but it still moves me. As noted in another review, the Recolletions album has more songs for less money, but doesn't include some of my favorites. What a voice! What a message!"
3,Sturdy but steps too narrow,"These steps were very easy to assemble. They're light-weight and the lamb's wool ""carpeting"" is a very nice touch. Although they support my 49 pound Corgi, the stairs are too narrow for a chubby, long dog with very short legs. Teddy manages by skipping a stair to get to his spot on the sofa, but these stairs are more suited for a smaller or miniature sized dog. Delivery was very quick also."
3,not top of the line but good enough...,This product proves we have to read the description to make sure we know what we're getting. I have 5 Havanese who can't quite jump up to the couch. This litte stepper is good enough for them to use and it's not so big they are intimidated byit. Snap together construction and think covering. The cover wears down quickly with use and from vacuuming. I wish I could buy replacement covers.
1,"Low Quality, No Cushioning","Just when I think that companies can't stoop any lower on quality to make a buck off of customers, something like this arrives in the mail. I bought two of these steps for my Mini Schnauzer who has Arthritis in her rear leg. Thinking this was going to be a plush, solid cushion design that would be comfortable for my dog to walk up was my first mistake. This item has a nine piece, hard-plastic, internal skeleton that snaps together and then you drape the cover over it. But the pieces kept coming apart as I tried to put on the cover, so I ended up having to tape all the joints with heavy-duty strapping tape. And it's a very rigid frame, with no give to it. Nice, deceptive presentation ya'll. I fell for it."
4,Very Lightweight,"I got these steps to help my 5 pound Chihuahua get up on our waist-high bed.Although I had to go on-line to buy the kit that adds a fourth step, I would definitely recommend these steps to anyone.They are simple, just a plastic frame with the cover, but they look good and my chi is no longer trying to jump on the bed!And you can't beat the price!"
5,doggie steps,"My very small shih tzu can now make her way onto the couch all by herself! The cover is washable (which is great) and they are very sturdy (even my grandson can sit on them though I don't let him very often)!!!! Thank-you for having an inexpensive solution for dogs, many other sites had the steps but they started at $50-60."
5,happy hound,Great set of steps I have a sheltie with short thin legs. She uses these steps every day several times a day and I don't have to worry about her having hip problems down the road from her always jumping on and off the bed and sofa. A real life saver as far as I am concerned.
5,Occasional Cow,"Occasional Cow is about this girl named Imogene. She always goes to camp but this year she can't, so she has to go to her aunt Bobo's house in Iowa. She has a hard time fitting in at first and then she gets to know them and starts playing with her cousins. She spies on their neighbor with them, with her new sunglasses. She is making the worlds longest gum wrapper chain. Her best friend is Eddie. I think you will like this book. I sure did."
5,probably one of the most fun books ever,I work with pre-school children and I just happened to find this book in the public library. I can honestly say I have used it in a storytime setting and never had so much fun. The children ranging from 2-5 yrs laughed and had a ball . There is something to be said for a fun book nowdays. They seem to be difficult for young children to be attentive for any length of time. Not so this one. They LOVED it.
1,Why Write like This?,"I may be too high-brow or too critical, but I kept wondering why anyone would spend time writing this, no less reading it. ""In Fidelity"" is full of pseudo-wisdom and half-truths, is very busy manipulating the reader--which made me wonder about the writer. Where is the pleasure in recieved ideas and two-dimensional, at best, characters, and with a plot that never soars, but plods. All the seams are showing and yet this book gets much attention. Can someone tell me why? If we want potboilers or sexy one dimensional stories, there are far juicier bad writers."
5,You won't be able to put it down - or stop thinking about it,What is so unusual about this book and Rose's writing in general is that she keeps you turning the pages and then for days after the book is over you are still thinking about some of the issues and questions her characters and her story line have brought to light.The reviewer above must have skipped over a whole lot of this book to not understand what the fuss is about.This is quality writing that is also entertaining. Smart and satisfying at the same time.
5,cute,These mini high lighters are super cute and are great to hang from badges and keep handy. They are useful and great colored.
1,worst purchase from amazon,This is the worst item I've ever bought from amazon in terms of the cost. Can one belief that I saw a similar product longer in length than this one at $1.95?
5,"Casio Watch - supplier ""Justin Calculatora""",Terrific performance by this supplier; they beat the projected delivery date. The product (Casio Watch) is excellent - I am one happy customer
3,really small and feminie,Watch works fine. It's really light and cheap as expected. I think it is better for a woman due to it's size - very small for a man's watch.
3,"Tiny watch, but good customer service","I just need a cheap watch for work. My last one of 10+ years finally had the strap break. When this one arrived and I tried it on I was surprised to find out how small-ish it was. It was about 3/4 the size of a regular watch, and the band barely fit around my wrist. I put it right back in the box, sent in a return request and mailed it back same day. Getting a refund and will try again. Thanks Amazon."
4,"Simple, Functional","It's just an inexpensive watch. Absolutely no frills. No date, no depth gauge, no heart monitor or any means of contacting Gotham City. It's just a cheap watch that, if it get's lost.. meh..The plastic wristband makes my arm sweat but it's comfortable. It doesn't cut in anywhere. It's ok."
4,Nerdcore original style for 1/10th the price,"Saw these at a designer store in town for $40. Then saw them on here for $11. Ordered two pair, and another dozen (yeah, 12 more!) for my nerd designer friends. Can't go wrong with a classic."
3,"Good looking watch for the money, but...","Mine died after only about 6 months. Not worth it to replace the battery or find out what else is wrong with it, so it's going to the trash. I'm going to do what I should have done to begin with (and what I recommend for others) and get a nicer watch. It's trite to say, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for."
4,Relógio para o Papai,"Casio é Casio. Tive um quando criana que durou até hoje nos meus 26 anos.Meu pai gosta de coisa mais tradicional, foi a escolha perfeita, ele adorou. E eu ainda irei usar em algumas ocasies, compra em parceria hahaha.Atualizarei quando tiver com o produto em mos. Comprei por intermédio de um amigo."
1,"the example ""webaution"" is not working","supposed it uses cloudscape. But actually not, finally I updated the cloud_table.dll users ""anno"" to ""annocloud"" and oracle_table users ""anno"" to ""annooracle"". and then re-initial the env and restart the servers, only user anno can logon! the user nameis in the program not in the database. How the author can do this??? the application does not use any database. read this book is wasting time!"
3,works as a replacement---but-----,"it replaces a damaged valve, BUT it wont allow the air tank to fill above 90 psi (the old valve it replaced would go to 120 psi). also, the air guage fitting is 1/4"" pipe thread, instead of 3/8"" of my old valve."
3,keeps the air in; perhaps too much.,"The valve did replace the faulty one on my portable air tank and fit just fine. It takes a long time to get the air back out though! Even fully open, it takes a long time to top off tires by just a few pounds."
1,Freedom from Fear...Seek Christ not Neil,"Once again Mr. Anderson ignores the fact that when we have accepted Christ into our lives, he heals all the problem areas in our life.As a therapist, Neil seems to continue to direct people to his programs and workshops rather than Christ. In acts we start with 11 scared men who only 43 days earlier watched Christ killed. They hid in FEAR of losing their own lives. But once they were blessed with the Holy Spirit, they were transformed into bold, fearless men who carried the message of the gospel until their deaths. Peter, who denied Christ 3 times, healed the sick and performed miracles.Got a problem with fear...seek Christ, not Neil."
3,Average Collection.,"This Album Has Some Classic Hits On It Like Sweet Caroline,Holly Holy And Cracklin' Rosie But It Is Not The Essential Package. I Think You're Better Off Paying A Bit More Money And Getting Alot More Great Music Than Paying Less And Getting Considerably Less Music. Having Said That, This Compilation Is Not A Bad Introduction To Diamond To A Casual Fan,But Not For Hardcore Fans. There Are Also Some Boring Cover Versions On It, But Worth A Listen."
1,Liberal Claptrap,"It is difficult to discern any interest here on Fr. Lewis's part other than to break his arm patting himself on the back that he is better than those horrible dispensationalists. Except for N.T. Wright, I don't think any of the people he cites even believe Jesus to be the Son of God."
5,SHAKEN UP!,My dogs were shaking their heads and then I received the ear cleaner promptly and packaged well. Everyone is back to normal!
2,Won't work in most US BluRay players,Can't get this to work on any of our devices. I have no idea if it's a good buy because I've still not seen it.
3,Fundamentals of Fast Swimming,"This video is for more advanced swimmers. The video does not discuss racing dives or flip turns which I consider techniques in the fundamentals of fast swimming. There were some excellent recommendations on how to reduce drag and increase speed for more advanced swimmers. If you already know all four basic swim strokes, this video will help you improve speed. This video is very short and does not cover as many swim techniques as I expected for my beginning racer."
5,Love Yo Gabba Gabba!,My son has had this DVD for awhile and continues to enjoy the music from the show. This is only one of the many Yo Gabba Gabba DVDs that he owns. I find enjoy the songs from this tv show too! It is a DVD worth buying because it will hold the little ones interest for awhile.
2,"A confusing scenery, changing the terms of the reality.","Very Briefly: As a Spaniard, I think the author has confused the terms of the conflict in Spain. So, the references to Catalans probably must be changed for example to Californians (very rich and self-sufficient), and to Basque people to any other State of the United States. In other words, Mr. Clancy ignores the reality concerning cultures in Spain, and only could be excused so that he introduces this book as a good exercise of fiction and negative sense to the real panorama in the world.Notwithstanding, I am a full supporter of this author, and it means that I estimate no fault in his work so the controversy between Catalans and the rest of Spain is in force now promoted by some politicians in our country."
3,Great book,"I thought this book was a little hard to get started with but when you got to the end it started geting better and better. It is about how a leader is corrupting spain and op-center is taking drastic measures to take him out. alot of action more and suspense but not one of tom clancys best booksThis book has torture scenes and bloody scenes, some surprises but mostly the usual stuff I do not recommend a parent buying this book for there kid they would probably get started then stop reading it because they thought it was boring."
1,Op-Center's strong anti-spanish bias,"This book represents a blatant insult to any sensitive person of spanish culture. It looks like having being written from a strongly prejudiced standpoint, and it is full of inaccuracies and negative topics with respect to my country (or to any latin american one, which seems to be confused with present day's Spain). If the authors consider it just fiction I would expect having such a kind of fiction about the author's country. By reading it one can realise that we, the spanish cultured people, do not have in Mr. Clancy & Co any enthusiastic admirer."
1,"Again, an evidence of american people ignorance","This kind of histories into the mind of american peolpe are dangerouses. Only serves to increase lack of culture about other countries and that is very sad. I don't understand you, Mr. Clancy what is your porpouse whith this garbage. Advice: you should travel little more."
3,"Although quite innacurate, it is also foretelling.","When I was reading this book, I was having fun. Despite showing innacurate information about Spain and its people, Clancy succeed in taking the basic roots of the current situation in Spain and modified the facts to imagine what could happen in a near future. Readers shouldn't take into account the classification of people in ""ethnic groups"" and the existence of ""famílias"" and some other things -- these are unreal. However, this book is fiction, and it has to be taken like this. The Spaniards who are attacking the book and the author seem to forget this fact, and also that all these things could really happen if there is no desire of tolerance between Castilians and Catalans/Basques right now. Here is where the author was wise, and it is owing to this fact that the book seems more realistic to me than to my Spanish fellows. Worth reading."
1,And I used to enjoy Clancy ....,"The most hilarious, pathetic and stupid novel I have read in the past years. The good thing about Clancy novels was that they were accurate: Red Storm Rising painted a chillingly exact third world war, down to the smallest political and military details. This one is pure nonsense from the word go.The problem, the real problem, is that millions of people will read it and think Spain is that way."
2,"This book is a nosense, Spain is not the third wolrd.","In that book Clancy translate the spanish sentences whit a computer and you can see that some are false. The ""Guadia Real"" is not a elite group of de Spanis army. And there are not any political problem in Spain, Catalan and Basques arel good people an we have our diferences but we won't do other civil war. And If someone wants to take the control of Sapin, he won't go to the Royal Palace it is a nosense, there are other political and military places more important than the Royal Palace."
2,Not a clever story teller,"This is the first TC's book I read and maybe I'll give him a second chance. But someone can tell me where's the plot? Spain is willing to have an upheaval, so what? Nobody there want the CIA involved so they make some kind of gore war. I've had read awfully better books than this one.Query: Did the CIA thwarted a revolution in Spain?"
1,Disjointed Stinker -- Gets a 9 on the Sominex scale,"This is my last Op-Center purchase. They have slid downhill since the first, and Balance of Power is by far the worst technothriller I've ever attempted to read. The cast is large and hard to follow since there appear to be numerous political groups at work to bring down the Spanish government. For all of that, there is the infuriating trademark conference between Op-Center regulars that drones on and on trying to set up and explain the plot and the political premise and background. These conference meetings between protagonist Paul Hood and his staff have a very strong preachy tone about them of which (I infer) it seems the authors wish the reader to become aware of these horrible socio-political injustices that make up the plot, as if they exist. I stopped trying to fathom this book on page 269 and literally threw it away."
1,Not up to Clancy's standards,"Clancy's books are usually well paced, gripping and built on plausible facts, but the Op-Center series is generally sub-standard. This one is sub-sub-standard. I feel thoroughly cheated. The action is spasmodic and the lack of knowledge of Spain downright pitiful. Clancy, haven't you ever been to Spain? The interplay of Spanish political forces is less than primary, the knowledge of Spanish people nil. The names are sometimes ridiculous and the characters can't even speak Spanish! Who wants my copy? I won't keep this one for a second reading."
5,Bonnets - for HS play,Bonnet was perfect for our high school play. Hat was large enough for adult. Gingham patters was bright. Shipped quickly.
2,Bogus Exodus to unlikely Arthur,"The first half of the book is good. It is an educating introduction to dendrochronology for the novice. I liked it. The author is an expert in this field. The material is well presented and easy to read. In the second part, unfortunately, the author writes on issues in which he is ill informed, including the history and archeology of Egypt, Israel, and Ireland. The second part of the book is repetitive, boring, and misguiding."
2,Starts out good but ended up curing my insomnia,"Even though this book excellently demonstrates how exact dates can be assigned to historically signifcant events (both localy and globaly) the author deviates too often from the original subject making it a difficult read. Secondly, large number of conjectures written in this book (in my opinion) are very questionable in there very nature or poorly presented.With the exception of the first 50 or so pages, this book put me to sleep every time I attempted to read it."
4,Could have used this earlier,"I wish I saw this book earlier. I could have used this on having a good impression on my woman's family. This book has plenty of things that I could have used on that particular instant in my life. Well, enough of that, that was in the past, moving on with the more formal review of this book. The author(s) clearly knows what they are doing and they have done it well in this book. I also readDating: Be Successful By Getting The Basicin which that book and this one goes along well."
4,VERY interesting -- not as insightful as I'd hoped,"Very good review of the basics -- excellent for young adults/early career types""what you don't know about how others see you"" gave me the impression that it would be more insightful than it really was ---book is EXCELLENT for base-knowledge"
3,"chapters cut off in Kindle edition, otherwise good","This is for the Kindle edition only. I've just started reading the Kindle book on my PC and am very new to Kindle. But twice now, two chapters are cut off in mid-sentence. Very bad for a purchased item!The book seems to be good and specific. Discusses body language, conversation, and appearance generally. Will update this review once I've finished reading."
