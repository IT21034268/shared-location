4,waterproofer.....,Applied to my tent to beef up the factory waterproofing. The tent has been up through 3 very hard rains and numerous early morning dews and fogs. No water inside what-so-ever. I'll be giving it the final test in about 3 weeks as I go camping with it. Didn't give it 5 stars because I want to see how it does while in use.
3,"Solid effort, actually 3 and a half stars","This is a really good album. Strong melodies/good song writing. One of those rare modern rock bands out there with talent. My favorite tracks are ""Exusable"", ""Air We Breathe"", ""Carolina"", ""Give and Take"", and ""Get There"". I hope these guys get some recognition for their work because they deserve it."
2,Prefer the EP,"'Get there', transition's second full length, isn't even as close to being as good as their last ep. On the EP, you could tell the band drew alot of inspiration from Relient K post-the anatomy of tounge and cheek, which made the songs faster, catchier and more pop-punk. This full length is actually closer to pop than pop-punk, and once again, mike herrera reminds me of why I don't like MxPx; his dull, mundane vocals on the especially bad track ""winters"". Basically, I blame mike and the recent popularity of [...] bands like ""october fall"" and ""the click 5"" for this upsettingly bad release. The whole record just feels so safe and commercial, like the all american rejects, but not quite as bad (to their credit). Fans of the EP should look elsewhere."
2,Poor photos,"While this book might be of some use to an antiques dealer, the photos are much to small and of to poor a quality to be of any use to a student of jewelry. I was very disappointed."
1,"Predictable, boring, not worth the time and effort","I was very disappointed in this book. After the first fivechapters, I couldn't go any further. Rather than trash what Ihad paid good money for, I attempted to give this book away to one of my friends who might would have a different opinion. Nodice--couldn't even give it away. Sorry to say but I could haveread something of similar nature, or better, for free in mylocal newspaper. I apologize for this poor review because theauthor's husband is one of my favorite writers."
3,Characters Underdeveloped but Entertaining...,"I read and very much enjoyed King's Same Sweet Girls, and the premise of this book sounded good to me, so I gave it a look. While overall, I enjoyed it, I found the character development to be lacking in many ways. For example, the narrator's minister husband, Ben, is completely unlikable from page 1, and I could not grasp how these two characters ever got together in the first place. The title character, Dean, kept making references to how she used to adore Ben, and I just couldn't fathom how. I didn't feel particularly sympathetic toward the plight of any of the characters, due to their 2-dimensional nature, though I found the story to be a fairly easy and painless read."
4,I know these characters,"This book was consuming. The characters were very well developed and the story kept me interested to the point where I wanted to be sitting in my reading chair with the book all the time. I read one review on the book that said something about it being a ""slice of life"" story, but I beg to differ. I said, several times, to my husband, that I wish I could meet Augusta (a central figure in the book). I feel like I do know her and Dean (the main character), but that I almost miss them!! I'm an avid reader and I have never felt that way before."
1,seat cushion,seat cushion began to fray at edges after 1 week. walmart product lasted longer @ less than 1/2 the price. very dissapointing!
5,perfect!,EXACTLY what I have been looking for! I remember my paretns and grandparents using these when I was growing up and knew this was what my boyfriend for his older model truck. It took me a long time to hunt them down but when I found them I knew this was what I wanted. We love them. They're wonderful. They allow the air to circulate under and behind us as well as offer some support in otherwise sagging truck seats. I'm not sure how long they will last based on other reviews but at least I now know where to find them. Highly recommend.
1,"Unreliable, lasted a week.","After the first week of use, this thermometer started giving bogus readings. At first reading, I found that my stated oven temperature was 25 degrees off for the thermometer; I had to turn it up to 375 to get the thermometer to go to 350. After a week of use the thermometer read below 200 degrees when the oven was set at 400. Just from the rush of hot air out of the oven, I could tell that the oven was much hotter than the thermometer was registering. Very disappointing to have such poor performance from this thermometer.If you found this review helpful, let me know with your vote below."
2,mine is not accurate,"This guy reads 350 when the oven (and a second thermo) reads 400.... Don't know if it is slow, but it's not accurate in my book. Would not recommend."
3,Andy Spletzer's constipated view..,"Andy Spletzers review suggests to me that he was not 8 years old in 1968. He is missed the magic of it totally. His review is is definately one of a kind, his. All things considered it was decent just not enough stills and discussion with cast members and to much about the sixties in general."
2,Not Thompson at his best,"Thompson is going through the motions here, with what is for him a very typical, even ordinary plot and an inconsistently characterized protagonist. The two female leads are unusually annoying, and the stakes never seem very high, despite the increasing body count. It's got its moments, but overall this is a major disappointment. Still, it's better than Texas By the Tail.If you want a taste of Thompson, just about any one of his other books is a better starting place."
2,Pseudo-comedy-romance-Thompson-not-good.,"This novel is interesting for Thompson completests, but do not make it the first novel of his that you read. There are a number of his novels that are much better than this one. Still, it's a pleasant time-waster if you are Thompson fanatic."
5,Takes out the chlorine,I change my tank once a week since my turtles are so little. It is essential that my water is ready to go after I do a tank change out each week. This product seems to do the trick - it takes out the chlorine.
4,Really like the product,Is very soft and have a great presentation for applying with care to your eyes. The only problem is that the case is the bad quality of the plastic container. I have used half of the product and the container is almost disintegrated.
3,Meh. I like MAC better.,"I like a lot of theBalm's stuff but wasn't overly impressed with this. Like another reviewer, I thought it made my wrinkles more noticeable and heaven knows I don't need that. I'll use it as an eyeshadow base so not a complete waste of money."
2,Too thin,"I tried this because my roommate raved about it, so I tried it because I naturally have very dark bags under my eyes. Unfortunately I found this product way too this to cover the darkness under my eyes."
2,not what I expected,"I read about this product on aol. The review made it sound like this was a magic fix. I've used it, but its not what I expected. Did not live up to the hype"
3,"Eh, not so much","I found this little item on the same site as I found the Egyptian Magic talking about how fabulous it was and how all of the stars use it, etc. Maybe it works for them but for me, it just sort of runs for my wrinkles and screams, ""Oh, hey! Look! I'm a wrinkle!"" I've tried to use it as a cover up for spot touch ups since it doesn't seem to work as a wrinkle concealer but it's kind of greasy and doesn't really do the trick there either. I won't buy it again and I'm not sure that I'd recommend it to someone else."
1,doesn't work,"We waited several weeks for this to work like the directions stated, however, we saw no decrease in the signs of mice in our house after that time. Had to go to poison which I didn't want to do."
5,10 Unique & Amazing Short Stories,"First produced for Polish television before the collapse of communism, Kieslowski's _Dekalog_ takes it's name from the ten one-hour episodes which comprise the series. While the ten films draw their inspiration -- and sometimes their titles -- from the ten commandments, the mapping is not so basic. And surprisingly, the film is not a preachy lecture on going to church.In each episode, Kieslowski follows a few people from a Warsaw housing complex. He does not create his characters; rather, they become known to the audience. None of them are evil. But getting to know these people means you see how they care for one another and how they hurt one another (often unintentionally).Ultimately, these films convey what it is to be alive better than any other I know. Add to that the rich characterization and beautiful cinematography and you have a wonderful, thought-provoking series."
5,I'm completely in awe,"After watching this remarkable work of art, I can't imagine going back to see Hollywood movies. Each episode of this TV series kept me glued to the screen with a well executed plot, superb acting, and the Kieslowski touch that is luminous in his films. Imagine the simplicity of the setting (an apartment high rise) and so many stories to tell! Each of the episodes is unique and interweaving with others. I want more!"
4,"SWINGIN"" SESSION!!!...","With out a doubt this is a swingin session, but it's not a classic nor does it stay with you long after you've played it but if you want to listen just to a really groovin album and you like Newk, this is the way to go. It's not a classic, but it's passable as a really swingin album. I would have liked to hear Surrey with the Fringe On Top in a more formal setting because it's my favorite song, but this version is o kay."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD.I just bought a 3-CD Sonny Rollins set that includes ""Sonny Rollins, Volume 1"", ""Sonny Rollins, Volume 2"", and ""Newk's Time."" These are the RVG Editions. Cost was $25."
1,Very sluggish,"Nice concept, but does not work well. very hard to set accuratel and bubble response is sluggish so that readings are not reliable. Personally I don't think it is worth the trouble."
2,"Good idea, badly executed","I collect field type watches and have over twenty of them. This model from RAM Instruments looked like a good deal so I purchased the ""Rugged"" model. I loved the look and simplicity and thought it might become my everyday wear watch, but I soon found that it was loosing about ten minutes on every hour. I replaced the battery thinking that might be the problem, but no luck. Regardless of how it looks, if if doesn't keep accurate time then its a no go for me."
4,Good Field Watch!,"I bought this watch for my son as a gift. I remember the ones just like this as a kid. The thin width case is what I like about it. In addition, the band is very strong and durable nylon webbing. The hands and face are very readable; even at night. So far it has survived his monthly Scout hikes and a week at summer camp too. Eight months later, it is still accurate and many people have complimented him when they ask about it (mostly other adults). It's a tough, handsome watch that is hard to beat in my opinion. The description does not indicate this, but the crown screws in to prevent water damage. My son loves it almost as much as I do! Maybe I should buy one for myself as well!"
3,A good testament to a great American art work,"The Watts Towers are one of America's great unique works of folk art/ architecture. The Goldstones' book documents their mysterious construction, the battle for their preservation, and provides many color photographs. But the disappointment is that the authors are unable to provide much insight into Simon Rodia, the enigmatic immigrant who built this mosaic monument in his backyard and then just walked away from them. The Watts Towers are visually glorious, but also speak to the artistic vision in ""ordinary people"" and the importance of obsession."
5,Fast and Easy,Amazon is faster that going to the store to buy this item. I would have to make a special trip and drive 22 miles each way.
1,DO NOT USE THIS ITEM!!!!,"After having my car seat installed by a certified car safety seat inspector, we learned items like this one are not crash tested and should NOT BE USED. You should only use the items that come packaged with your car seat.Bottom line----I love my child more than how the interior of my car looks. This item and others were immediately returned!!"
2,Does not hold car seat secure on leather,I thought this product was the greatest thing unitl I went to install the car seat in the car with this underneath. I have leather seats in my car and this product did not hold the car seat in a secure. The car seat slid around when this product was underneath it. I am sure for cloth seats it would have been fine. I ended up using a regular towel to protect the seat and it holds the car seat just fine.
4,"I really like this undermat,but...","My husband and I both purchased this for our vehicles. It is great to store extra stuff in the pockets, but it doesn't really fit securely in the car. You have to tuck it into the seat a little to get it to stay. As for keeping the car clean? It is really too small to cover any part of the car. As for protecting your seat? Get the plastic undermats instead! I have leather in my SUV and the hard plastic on the car seat still digs into the leather. I like it, but... I would rather have bought a backseat organizer to use it to hold extras like toys and snacks."
2,Not really useful,I think this is a waste of money. Not very useful. There are better ones out there.
3,Good for cloth seats only!,"I bought this mat for my car with leather seats and it made the car seat slide around, no matter how tight I made the seatbelt. If you have leather seats, do not use this mat. Use a thick, rubber mat instead. Not only will this keep your car seat in place, it will protect your leather from indentations from the weight of the car seat. I actually use both now, I put the rubber mat on the seat and then I put this cloth one on top because it has handy pockets."
1,Doesn't Work Well,"I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not. They do not ""grip"" our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit. We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners. They advised us the us to use shelf liner. I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner. It works the same and is more attractive."
2,Do not use -- safety for your child comes first!,"Although I have nothing against this product, I too went to get my car safety inspected by the California Highway Patrol and was advised not to use any after-marketing accessories. This product has not been crash testing and I did find that the car seat had less ""grip"" with the seats and more ""give"". He advised me to use grip lining (typically used for shelves) and I purchased a color to match the interior."
3,Great teachings but lots bad grammar and typos,Anyone else experience this? I have the heart of Sufism which I really enjoy. The typos in this kind of turn me off.
5,Mysterious America,"A real must have. A great book, well researched and written that will keep you amazed and enthralled. You won't be able to put this one down."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I love the idea underlying this book, and parts of it are quite good. But there are problems. First, Loren Coleman's occasional partner, Jerome Clark, writes on the same subject matter much more effectively. Why not just read him? Second, in ""Mysterious America,"" Coleman devotes too much space to phantom felines and other cryptids. I'm interested in cryptozoology, but there are already several books on the subject, including a decent one by Coleman and Clark, and an outstanding one by Karl Shuker. Third, the lists at the end of the book are helpful, but excessive (arguably gratuitous). Last, but not least, I'm sick and tired of Coleman's massive feelings of insecurity and inferiority, and the resultant overcompensating self-recognition and self-praise. My God, it's a miasma that permeates every book he writes!Bottom line: ""Mysterious America"" is O.K., but it's not more than that."
4,Great intro to a different cinematic world,"If you're not used to silent movies they can be a lot of hard work. I've spent a lot of time watching silent comedies (mainly Keaton, Harold Lloyd and L&H) but Stella Maris was my first drama.One Sunday afternoon I put it in the DVD and tied my wife to the chair to watch it with me...no problem. Within minutes we were both mesmerized and 84 minutes later had experienced a truly wonderful film.I'd read about Mary Pickford, but never seen her and really only bought this out of interest because I was reading Samuel Goldwyn's biography at the time.The end result? An good, solid introduction to silent drama and Ms. Pickford and a good quality DVD to boot. Nicely restored with an understated soundtrack.As a bonus there's some nice home movie stuff and news reels of Pickford at the height of her fame."
4,If U love The Quo it's worth it,"I am a life long Quo fan, I enjoyed this because it gave me more insight into the makings of a great rock bands studio album & just how the other half lives. It is a good way to learn about Quo & see some good old videos of their rockin."
2,Experts only,This one I recommend for experienced model builders. I made the mistake of building this as my first one. Now I broke one of my arms. The only thing I didn't like was the little screws you have to put in the arm. I did it too tight an the elbow joint snapped. The model is very detailed and little decaling is needed. So don't buy this as your first model. I would recommend the Guntank for starters.
1,gundam mgrx-79,was not aware that it came in so many pieces and needed to be put together. It's still not put together because the instructions are difficult to figure out. I wish my son could do this him self but he's only 6yr and I ALREADY have enough on my plate to do besides trying to figure out a map i don't understand if it was simple it wouldn't be a problem.
5,Savage Garden Becomes Eden,"What can I say about this album that isn't good. The lyrics are powerful and the melodies are enough to take me back into my childhood. Darren Hayes lives up to the expectation that was left by Savage Garden and even surpasses it. This album is always just a play button away from me. It's very reminiscent of Michael Jackson's early career and I love it. Songs like ""Good Enough"" and ""Spin"" take me back to the good old days. ""Strange Relationship"" and ""Heart Attack"" with the message of I'm not gonna take that from you anymore gives such a strong sense of will, and songs like ""I Can't Ever Get Enough of You"" and ""I Miss You"" remind us of how vital love is and that it's worthwhile. This album turns a Savage Garden into the Garden of Eden."
5,It's Fantabulous!,"I thought that my favorite band was over when Savage Garden broke up. Honestly, I wasn't really expecting too much from Darren's solo debut. I was really suprised!! I love it!! I have listened to it all of the hours that a day will permit. If you loved Affimation than you'll love this. It's got basically the same sweetness about it. With a touch of some more R&B type stuff. This album it the best!"
4,Out of the garden,"Good debut solo album by the voice of Savage Garden. Most of the songs are incredibly catchy. Does not get a 5 star rating due to the over use of synths or electronic elements. There are no tracks that are as good as ""I Knew I Loved You,"" but the first single ""Spin"" is fairly good. However the best track is ""I Can't Ever Get Enough of You"". All songs are solid, except maybe Crush (1980 Me) which is just strange,and the album flows well from song to song. Overall a good album without many solid singles, and a decent value for a 62 minute cd."
4,delightful,What a surprise for me. This was a great earl grey. The flavor was just right and it is a great way for me to wake up in the morning.
2,A Matter Of Preference,"I realize that taste is subjective; a matter of personal preference, and I prefer my tea to be on the strong side. Since I use the JavajigMelitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter System for Single Serve, 1.90 Ounceto make my tea I don't have a lot of choices as far as steeping times, temperatures etc.This was a bland tea with an aroma that is reminiscent to Vicks VapoRub, well at least to my nose. It must have some essence of Eucalyptus and/or camphor in it although the ingredients say not. It is supposed to have been scented with bergamot, but frankly I'm not so sure.A pale gold tea with a pale flavor. It is very, very delicate not the hearty type of tea I prefer. I should have read the description and reviews HERE before buying it elsewhere, like I did.The cost is a bit much at nearly $10 dollars for about 4oz. of tea."
4,well done amy,"For her age at the time of recording this was an excellant piece of music. Grant's voice is like melting butter, something which has changed through her career and become more versatile. Grant writes beautifully straight from the fathers heart. Songs like 'lay down' strike chords in me that take me closer to God. 'oh sacred heart' written may years previously was impeccable recorded by only the grace of God as Grant describes, He provided the thunderstorm at 3am, they provided the vocals. Well done to Amy, the albums that followed only get better!"
3,Better to watch and hear than just listen.,"This CD is OK. Todd Barry is one of my favorite comedians, but on CD, it just don't come across. The content isn't that great, and they feel like separate tracks instead of one continuous performance.I'm sure if this was a DVD instead, and we could see his face, that it would be much funnier."
3,Heartwarming,"I liked the characters in this book and thought it was a sweet love story. How could you not love these two. What a sweet, kind man Will was. Elly was a woman of great kindness and character. There were parts of the book that seemed slow though. Also, although I recognize that the way in which the characters spoke was realistic, I found reading it difficult."
4,Book review,"I purchased this book for my Mother's collection. She and I were totally pleased with the book. We received it in a timely fashion, and it was good shape. I am so glad I was able to surprise my Mother with this nice book. Thank-you!"
5,Descriptively Beautiful!,"When the author wrote this book, she left nothing to the imagination. She drew the most beautiful pictures with her words putting you right into the middle of the story. She described the smells, the colors, the body language, the surroundings, and the feelings from both Will Parker and Eleanor Dinsmore. You knew just how they were both feeling and understood why they felt like they did. You understood what made Will tick and also Elly. She made you want Will to be loved by Elly and Elly to be loved by Will. This is not a Cinderella Story. This is a down to earth story about what could really happen to everyday people. This is a story of true life struggles just to be accepted and to be grateful for life's little treasures. You'll love this story. It's a heart warmer!"
3,Leading Lady with a lot of Heart,"This is not my favorite show on USA, but I do really like it. The lead character has such great heart. It is fun to watch her as she navigates through her personal & professional life in this series. I am going to give it 3 stars instead of 4 -- which was hard to do because I do enjoy it -- in comparison to my others shows the pull & personal connection it has for me isn't as strong. It is in no way a bad reflection on the series because it is a sound enjoyable show."
5,Very Happymom!!,I saw a preview for this show the other night and found the pilot on OnDemand and decided to watch it. I was so happy to find this on Amazon so now I can get all caught up before season 3 starts! Very fun show and keeps my interest all the time!!
4,I'm really diggin' this,"A review I read (not here) bad-mouthed this, but I got a chance to hear it and my ears loved it. Far from a ""blowing session,"" these tunes represent Pearson's compositional and arranging skills, and incorporate tasty solos without abandoning melody and form. A very cool 60s groove."
1,JUST HORRIBLE,"For the first time ever I regret buying a Modern Talking CD.WHAT ON EARTH ARE THEY DOING? This CD is pure [stuff] and thats something coming from a long time MT fan such as myself. I totally don't understand the ratings other people gave this album, but I do respect their opinions. And whats with the ripoff of the Billy Joel ""Up Town Girl"" at the start of Knocking On My Door? Or the Michael Jackson ""Thriller"" riffs, etc, etc. This album is STALE and a rip off of other songs. Thank goodness the last album was so much better. The one song that I ""kinda"" like which is ""Who will be there"" would be better off if Dieter kept his mouth shut. His back up singing is TERRIBLE!! on this song. This Album is a HUGE dissapointment. I look forward to the next album and hope this was just one of those ""bad apples"" that all bands go through. If your wanting some good, I mean real good synth, check out ""Intuition"" the album ""Further"" and the Single ""Two"".Come on MT, you can do MUCH better."
1,Misinformed,"As a Registered Dietitian, I am unhappy with some of the incorrect advice given in the introduction.Total Fat: They recommend choosing foods with a ""big difference between the total number of calories and the number of calories from fat."" This is poor advice, think nuts. Example: 1/4 cup pecans contains 210 calories with 190 from total fat...however only 2 g of saturated. This would be a wonderful choice as long as the serving size was adhered to.Trans Fat: It is completely untrue that ""if a liquid oil is listed first in the ingredient list, it is a sign that the food contains a lot of trans fat."" This is ridiculous and completely false. They should have just gone with the suggestion to ""avoid foods that contain hydrogenated oil"" and added ""avoid partially hydrogenated"" oil."
4,THEY WORK,"A NICE SET OF DEEP SOCKETS FOR THE PRICE , NOT FOR EVERYDAY USE BUT DO THE JOB WHEN NEEDED . AS WITH ANYTHING YOU BUY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!"
3,Not the strongest - but great customer service,"The obvious first: 9 piece set means 8 pieces of metal and 1 piece of plastic to hold them together. The price for this set was very low and I did not expect much, but unfortunately my (low) expectations were not met. I tried to remove a bolt using a torque wrench set to 45 Nm and it stripped the inside of the socket. Socket was of the right size and covered the bolt head completely. I will take a look at their lifetime warranty, but I am afraid that shipping cost will be higher than the price of the set.Update 01/27/2013: Customer service contacted me and sent me a replacement socket (they even sent the upgraded Chrome-Vanadium version). 5 stars for this kind of service, especially in this price range! It seems that the stronger TEKTON 1240 series would have been the better choice for me."
3,sevylor canoe,bought to use with a inflatable sevylor canoe ...it is good for a back up battery ..try getting a wheel chair battery if you need something light weight..it is just a larger version of this and gives you more time on the water :o)
2,Warped vinyl,This vinyl I bought is warped and the review said it was in perfect conditions and that's not true. I don't like it.
5,Redating the new testament with early dates,"Carmignac, a noted linguist, studied the Dead Sea Scrolls. He was astonished to find the Hebrew used in the scrolls to be identical to the Semitisms of thought, vocabulary, syntax and style in the gospel of Mark. Technical investigations into both Mark and Mathew resulted in what Carmignac insists is proof that both were written in Hebrew originally. He also argues that he has proof that the gospels were written far earlier than most scholars suspect.Carmignac believes that Acts was written a little after 60. He places a completed Mark at 45-50, between 50-55 for Mathew, and Luke a little after 50. lAnyone interested in this short but important book may also want to read Redating the New Testament by Robinson."
1,Chaplin Fans -- Stay Away,"This is a sad excuse for a comedy from a once-great filmmaker. Fans of Charlie Chaplin can only be saddened and depressed by this lugubrious waste of time. Chaplin vents his spleen at the U.S. (justifiably so), but his satire is ineffective and the slapstick just doesn't work.There is a second film on this DVD, but ""A Woman of Paris,"" while a wonderful film, is not a Chaplin comedy (he only makes a brief cameo appearance and if you don't know it's him you'll miss him completely), and needs to be seen on a big screen to do it justice. So I can't honestly recommend this DVD for most people. This is only for rabid Chaplin completists who must have everything he ever made. For the rest of us, go out and buy ""City Lights"" or ""Modern Times"" instead, and see Chaplin at his best and in his prime."
1,Insulting.,"God didn't create us to be doormats. Women shouldn't be invisible with nothing to hope for but more invisibility. My assessment: Treacly clap-trap, from a treacle/snake-oil saleswoman.I am female, I am Christian, and I am woman: hear me roar.Reminds me of all the things I dislike in contemporary Christian culture: pop-psychology, pabulum, and schmaltz--applied with a heavy hand.If you like the Purpose Driven Life (tm) you will probably like this woman and her writings. However, I don't see that as an endorsement of either."
1,Rather inconsequential...,"This release did nothing at all for me. The storylines are weak and the art is dated and mediocre. These shorts strike me as the Soviet equivalent of those crufty, ephemeral 8mm films you find at flea markets and in the storerooms of elementary school libraries. Masterworks these are not."
2,"Dont get me wrong ,i'm a hard-core Star Wars fan ...but.....",The problem with this book is it's BORING!..it's not the plot..not the characters..but the writer himself!! The whole story when i think of it now seems pretty good..but when the writing is lousy HOW in the world can u enjoy it?!?!?I for 1 think Mr.McDowell should have been a lecturer NOT a writer.
5,A dazzling end to an amazing trilogy,"This book was incredible. It combined some wry humor with a somewhat darker storyline than is to be expected. The whole trilogy, in fact, explores a dark side of Star Wars that is rarely captured in the other books or the movies. It tells you that this is serious, and that makes it seem much more vivid and realistic. This trilogy proves that Star Wars is a verstile concept, and that there can be many different realities to be considered.To put it simply: Read this book, as well as the other two in the trilogy"
1,How could George Lucas let this published!?,"Look. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but this book (actually the whole trilogy) is nothing but crap!No apologies! The Star Wars universe has been contaminated and this series is the final straw.Star Wars is fun. These books are not. The plot is dull and the writing is boring.I just can't be construction with this - I am angry that George Lucas has let the Star WarsUniverse turn into such dribble. But, I am a Star Wars fan and I will continue buy any and all booksthat come out. I just hope that George Lucas raises his standards or at least that the publishingcompany will look a little harder into the book...and not just that it is Star Wars.We, the fans, deserve a lot more than what this series has to offer"
2,A disappointing end,"After reading the first two books in the trilogy, I was truly expecting something better. The first book was terrible, the second was pretty good, but the third was a little disappointing. The third book failed to fully show a climax; everything just magicly solved itself. If you are going to read this book, then I must tell you to not expect much."
5,Better than the Tom Cruise movie!,Unbelievable true stories about other plots to kill Hitler from secret files. Great new information not found in history books.
4,A Well-balanced compilation,"I just purchased this CD, and am pleased with the variety of jazz styles. I dropped my rating by one star as Kenny G's song nearly put me to sleep."
4,VHS was audible (heard that the DVD wasn't),"This video was very entertaining. It felt like visiting old friends. I highly recommend it. I could hear it all even given a laugh track that could be a little lower or nonexistent.. I felt that the Roast of Sammy Davis was a lot funnier than that of Jackie Gleason - if not for that, I would have rated it a 5 star."
2,No Way!!!!,"I'm not saying this game was terrible it was just really hard. The first two levels in Japan are easy but when you get to battleing the boss you can't beat him. I tried, my dad tried, and my younger brother(7) tried. None of us could beat him. My brother thought the game was fun but he would get really mad when he couldn't beat that level. He had fun with the other 2 levels though. But he couldn't do anything else but play those 2 levels over and over again. He got bored fast and wanted a new game to play. So we traded it in. Trust me if a little kid wants this game and doesn't have a lot of experience with games don't buy it!!!! It's a waste of your [$$]."
4,Scooby-Doo Review,"I only gave this game four stars because it is very hard. I am fairly good at playstation, but I cannot get past the second world in this one game. I find the difficulty on level 2 in this game to be as hard as the difficulty on level 10 in some other games. However, I love Scooby-Doo and his friends. This game is hard to master, but still a lot of fun to play. I find that I still like to sit down for an hour and try to beat the levels even though I can't get past the second world. I would recommend this game to other Scooby-Doo fans."
1,DO NOT BUY,"First of all, everytime you start up your console you have to ""install"" the memory card by putting in a CD and then starting the game from that cd. Second, it doesn't work with all games. I bought 5 games and it only worked successfully with one and to get it to work you have to first put in the memory cd then hit start then put in the game cd then hit some more buttons, then CROSS your fingers and hope it works. DO NOT BUY..."
4,It does TOO work!,"It took me a little while to figure it out and at first it did seem a little annoying to have to go through the loading process, but the alternative is to be unable to save any data at all, as there are NO Sony memory cards available ANYWHERE. My family and I took almost no time to get into the habit of loading the memory before installing a game and now, its no big deal. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those folks like me and my family who are just venturing into the current incarnation of video games systems! (You can't get any ""E"" for everyone-type games for Nintendo 64 anymore!)."
1,STOP!,This card must be loaded from CD EVERY time the console is powerd on! I cannot say enough bad things about this card. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Save your pennies and get the read deal.
4,Not that bad....,"I didnt really want to buy this memory card but greedy sony doesnt keep the official memory cards in stock. I read some reviews on this card none of them good. but i found that its really not that bad, yes you have to load the software each time you start your ps2 it takes about 30 seconds, 30 seconds shouldnt bug you that bad. I haven't had any trouble using it.......works great :)"
1,This is the buggest waste of money,"Bought it and great it saves games, ONLY after loading the special software for it....On top of that it would ""unformat"" every few days. Do your self a favor, watch reruns of the real McCoys or This old home... That would be less painful than this piece of junk...."
1,16mb memory card,"In as few words as I can write....this is a very bad product. Simply put, it does not work."
3,16mb memory card .,this 16mb is very diffrent from the 8mb.you can hold alot more memory on the 16mb.thats what i like alot.but the only thing i dont like is that i have to use a cd every time i turn off the game.
1,DONT BUY,"Do NOT buy this memory card. I bought this card, and have paid the price. I talked with a SCEA representative. He said this product will damage your PS2 after just one use or many times of use. It damaged my PS2 in late July. I bought my product in Early April. I bought Star Wars Super Bombad Racing and it worked on a friend's PS2. But I used it on mine, and and odd noise popped up when I inserted the disc. It has done the same thing with 1/2 of my PS1 games. The representative said that the company has NOT licensed their product, and it has not been tested on the PS2. The representative said stick with the Sony cards, for they have been tested and approved on all PS2 games. Besides, you don't need 16MB of space. 8MB is fine. Do not buy Flash Memory 8MB either."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This Memory Card is not liscensed by Sony. It requires you to load a program prior to using the memory card every time you turn on or reset your system. My system was unable to read data after a few days without accessing it. This card and its program are now in the trash where they belong. This was a waste of money, and a completely worthless product."
1,Biggest mistake I ever made,"This is the worst memory card I've ever had the displeasure of using. It wiped out 3 of my video games so now I can't even play them, when you contact their customer service they will not respond to your letters or calls. I can't believe they are allowed to sell such junk. DO NOT BUY, instead spend the extra 5 bucks and get the real one, believe me it will be well worth it."
2,Dont buy,This card is really bad because some of my games cant use it like gta2 and you have to load it whenver you want to use itdont buy it. The extra money for the 8 MB is worth it
2,The thing is a pain,"First, I hate having to load the software any time you run a game.Second, when you get up to 99 or so save, it takes an eternity for the software or a game to read the card.Third, I can't prove this for a fact, but it's my opinion as a programmer that the memory management software uses enough of the Playstations memory that it slows the game down. I had Grandia II slow down considerably and even lock-up. Please, if anyone else does or doesn't have this problem post it here."
3,i like this product,"i just got mind yesterday..and yes, it takes an extra 30 seconds to load the software before u start a game..but that's it. given that there is such a lack of memory on the market.. i settled for this and found that it works fine... it works on my regular US PS2 system on HighHeat2003, GTA and madden 2001 so far. haven't seen any problems yet. i would say give it a try if you can't get the sony card"
2,This is stupid!,"This Memory Card is the worst, because every time you want to play a PS2 game, you have to load the disc in EVERY TIME!Every time I crushed a file, I could never delete the normal file! I got far on Final Fantasy X, and MGS2, then it froze, saying I didnt insert a PS2 disc, plus the disc cracked, since you dont get a case with it. I totally prefer the Sony Memory Card. Dont waste [your money on this junk]."
2,Sizing issue,Apparently the designer of this shirt expected a pregnant woman who wears an extra large to also wear an A cup bra!
3,Not for new users,"My 5 year old daughter received a gameboy advanced with this game for her birthday. She tried playing it, after I read her the instructions but soon became frustrated. For a kid who has not had much exposure to video games this is not a good first game. I had a lot of fun with it but it does not ""guide"" the player, so you need to be able to read (and remember) the instructions."
4,this game is pretty good but gets boring once you beat it,i liked this game until I beat it! it is fun but there needs to be some more game modes or longer game modes but other then that it is pretty damn FUN! if you like basketball then it is your type of game! even if you don't it's still fun
5,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!,"I've heard so much about this game, and i have not even played it yet. I can't wait until i get it in a couple of games. People say that you can be NELLEY! All i want to do, is throw the ball againsts Shaq's head, like in the commercial."
4,Great Game BUT liked the first one better,"I Loved the game really so much fun. The best is be a legend it is like you try to be the best street star. You also can make a team in the regular version like the 1st one. I made a team with Yao, Kobe, Shaq, Iverson, and MJ. It was so much advaced and every thing but i like games that are simpile."
2,Robert Forward has done better,I could not finish this book. Dr.Forward has produced some excellent speculative fiction including Rocheworld and Neutron Star. This book did not measure up to those standards. I found the character's to be unbelieveable and the attempts to inject sex into the book to be extremely distracting. Two different characters daydream about feeling someone elses fingernails down their back in the first 25 pages. I know Dr.Forward can do better than this.
2,nothing to tell,"This biography of Kay Francis is short. And spare. The problem seems to be there is nowhere to find anything out about her life, just her diary, a few letters, and the biographies of her friends and employers. Seems all she did was work and hop in the sack with just about anyone. I was hoping for a lot more, but there is a dearth of material on her, it seems."
4,bulky and repetitive... cool shield though,"This is a decent model and some parts of the plastic have a very nice feel to it. The material is also very thick like the PG series, which is good. What I liked best about this gundam is the shield, which is probably the best looking part of the whole kit. It has a lot of details and color variation and feels and looks like something you would get from an action figure. The downside is that the arms are very weak and falls off very easily. There is also no way that it can hold up the shield without and modifications. At the price of $20.. I cant complain. Buy it."
5,Very Large Model,This is a great model. Its very detailed and is a blast to assemble. Out of the box expect 3-6 hours for the average builder. There are very few parts that require painting to make look original. As is from Bandai this is a great model. only downside to it is that the large boozoka wielding shield is to large for the arm to support by itself. You can get it to rest on the leg but it doesnt rest very well. Overall I highly recomend the purchase of this model to add to your collection. For the price its done nicely.
5,Such a powerful group!,"I was introduced to Jodie Manross and her band last year, and I quickly ordered the group's CD. If most definately deserves 5 stars. Jodie has the most powerful, beautiful voice, one that can rival and stand up to those artists that are so popular today. Her lyrics are moving and poetic. The band is also awesome. The blend of soulful ballads and funky beats is unforgettable. I also saw the group live in Knoxville, and the sound just as great live as they do on the CD. Everyone should check this one out. It is wonderful! There is no other word to describe it!"
5,OMG buy one now!,"I have caned sauces, stews, chili....sending the cans to college with my kids. Now I am making gifts. This product is so easy and reliable! This is the SAFE way to can!"
3,sealing with out gasket,product seems to be well made but i have a hard time getting the lid to seal. it allways seam to leak in the same spot
5,Heavy Duty Pressure Cooker,Heavy Duty Safe & Durable Pressure Cooker. I highly recommend this pressure cooker for canning. Its awesome! The canner won't dent and the clamp down lid makes it safer than lower cost versions.
3,"Bought it to cook beans, can't cook beans.","The inside is very rough - not great for cooking with. This is primarily a canning item.thankfully the one I have is big enough to put in another container to hold the food - I just put water on the outside to keep it from burning.I bought it to cook things with a solar reflector. it will do it's job, but given another choice I would buy one meant for cooking and not canning.Also, the instructions say it isn't meant to cook beans or rice. WTF?"
4,great music,"when i bought this cd it was only because i was a sporty spice fan and i wanted to see what she was up to, i wasnt expecting much. i didnt buy or listen to northern star so i didnt know what type of music i was going to listen to from reason but much to my surprise the whole cd was great. the whole thing flowed from song to song, i got a little uneasy when soul boy started because the opening beat was different from the other song but it turned out to be a beautiful song. the last few songs are a little edgier. all the songs fit perfectly, they all add something different. on the horizon is a little more upbeat and one of my favorites along with soul boy which is very different than anything ive ever heard. melanie c truly is the most talened of the spice girls, and surprised me with this album. its easy listening and i love all of it. the only reason i didnt give 5 stars was because the songs water and home didnt fit well with my type of style but they are still well written and sung."
5,Better than Brittney or Christina!,"As a Yank, I was blown away by this album. I had heard her single Never Be the Same Again, and liked it enough to buy the Reason CD...glad I did. Outstanding work...wake up America and check her out! As far as writing goes, this outdoes anything Brittney or Christina could come up with. Great mixture of emotion and pure energy. The whole CD is good, but favorites are: Positively Somewhere - Very reflective; Let's Love - pure rock and fun!; Yeh Yeh Yeh - Party!; On the Horizon - Makes an optimist out of me :)"
2,A bit disappointing.,"I expected a much more interesting memoir than this book turned out to be. Mrs. Albright seemed to do a lot of stroking the many people she worked with in this book. It felt more like an advertisement for different politicians than an insightful, thought-provoking read. I was very sorry as I admire Madeleine Albright, quite a lot."
4,Interesting look at the other side ..,"I disagree with the comments reviewer: Beth Hartford-DeRoos ""motherlodebeth wrote.I thought this was very helpful. And enjoyed her honesty about her insecurities. I thought Beths' review was very judgemental. You have never dated someone and made fun of them with your friends? We all have at least once. You missed the point in the book, that we all have our own issues and dont know what the other person was or is feeling or going through.I am a Burnt Toast eater, a 33 year old married mother of 2 that hasn't learned how to do things to make me happy. Like Teri, when my kids are away, I feel lonely and bored, wondering around an empty house. This is for us mothers that spend 3 hours feeding bathing and putting to be d out children to squeeze 20 mins to do the same for ourselves.I cannot wait to take a wine bath tonight. won't be until about 1 am - when I am done gettign the house in order .:)This is a worthwhile experience. Eat the good toast!"
3,great,a must read if you are strugglin with self esteem issues...or if your just a desperate housweives fan..it was a great bookand she did reeally great in writing it...its definalty a keeper and i will go back someday and reread it again.
2,Worked well until the DVD broke,"The picture is good and the combo was convenient. However, after 1 year, the DVD broke. Now I have just a TV. This is the problem with combos. It is better to get components separately."
5,Where is KZON 8?,"I love the KZON series, but I have been searching for volume 8 for years. Why does it never show up here or on Ebay....ever?"
3,Interesting enough,"Though every song on this cd doesn't satisfy my particular taste, there really is SOMETHING on there for everyone. One day, a couple of weeks ago I stuck this cd in with six people in my car. We couldn't skip ONE song, because someone would scream ""Wait!!! Don't skip it, I LOVE this song!""It's definetly not my favorite cd of my collection, but I do love to pop it in to hear some of the fun early 90's tunes I remember from what seemed like yesterday (ten YEARS ago!!! What?) I think it's definetly worth LISTENING to, but you'll have th decide for yourself if you're interested in purchasing it."
4,Hidden Hitch 70530,"Was pleased with the time it took to receive this item. The hitch itself was a bit scratched up for being new. I used this to pull a tow dolly and car from Delaware to Arizona, and it worked great."
5,A star has been reborn...,"Charlie's cd has been a work in progress and a labor of love for quite some time. We've been promised something special, and Chuck has delivered, with a sonic treat that will not leave your CD player for a long time."
1,Cup holder a puzzle,"Despite warnings from other customers, bought this and tried to get it to work in my car (Mazda 3, 2012). It is, as noted by others, difficult to ""operate."" And believe me, ""operate"" is the right word. Directions of no help. I got it to adjust once, but I couldn't duplicate the procedure in the car and ended up breaking a piece of the plastic/puzzle."
5,The next step in fundamentals!,"As someone who has been in sales or sales management for over twenty years, this was one of the best books I have ever read on selling! Whether a person is new to selling or an experienced professional this is a MUST read! Its all about the fundamentals of reaching the next level of sales success. All success starts with self then moves to servicing the customer. Brian starts us on the track to building a strong personal plan: then carrys that plan forward towards a rewarding sales career. Thanks, Brian"
3,Redneck relapse,"This may be their most expansive official studio output, though is still only filled with half-compelling songs that do little to bring the sacred energy they spent their entire careers trying to recapture."
3,Not the best Donald Fagen has done..,"I just never seemed to find where this was going, You get no sense of direction throughout the entire album. It's lost. I guess it's hard to top Aja and The Night Fly. Maybe buy a remastered copy of either of those albums"
2,Can you spell Sequencer?,"Or can you spell loops? The only reason for rating this a two is that: 1, someone took the time to sequence everything. 2, someone took the time to lay down musical loops on top of the sequencing. Hopefully the vocals aren't sequenced too. There are already enough things that are routine without listening to sequenced music loops."
3,A Steely Disapointment,"I own about everything Steely Dan has done. I rarely play this CD. I might play the H Gang, but this is a big miss by a great artist. I can't put Donald down. He is amazing, but I don't play this much at all.Sorry Steely,It's a miss. Nice audio if you like CD's. I don't. I play vinyl and based on what I heard, I just won't pony up the money to buy it on vinyl."
1,What happened?,"Did I get a bad copy? This sounds so muddy, I went through all my equalizer settings and it still sounds awful. I've been a Steely Dan and a D, Fagen fan for years, but this CD sounds bad, I'm sorry but I wish I could get my money back."
5,Morph The Cat by Donald Fagen,"Morph the CatIf you are a fan of Steely Dan, you will enjoy this album!"
3,All I want was some fun...,"As a Steely Dan fan since 1980's, I was shocked by the first listening of MTC. Nothing was new and surprizing.The musicians are like allways technically brillant, but the work itself smells old fashioned.Sorry Mr. Fagen but I will continue to turn The Nightfly on my CD-player..."
3,This is mostly Two Against Nature redux,Let me start by saying I love Kamikiriad and Nightfly which I listen to regularly to this day. This is NOT either of those two. MTC sounds like it came from the same sessions as TAN which I was not a fan of. Becker's guitar playing just doesn't do it for me for more than the rare contribution. There's also only so much of that upbeat tempo of Brite Nitegown a person can take. A few songs are pretty good....you'll know which ones I mean.
5,Donald Fagen Delivers,"First off, I am a huge Steely Dan fan and I like DF's solo ventures as well. I loved the Nightfly, but was a bit disappointed in Kamakiriad...thought it was a little bland. I was even slightly disappointed with EMG, but I loved Two Against Nature, so I wasn't sure what to expect from Morph. Rest assured, this album is great and is destined to become a Fagen classic along the lines of Nightfly.As with most Steely Dan/Fagen work repeated listenings pay off immensly. At first listen I liked Morph The Cat and What I Do the most, but now after listing about 10 times I can truly say that each song is excellent and satisfying in its' own way. The lyrics are sharp and the melodies are layered beautifully and Fagen's voice do each song justice.If you like great, sophisticated music or would like to be introduced to it, go out and buy this one...you won't regret it."
5,Today's 'King of Cool',"Granted this may not be as stylistically diverse as older Steely Dan albums, although I love this album. What blows me away is the purity of the sound quality. You need one of two things to enjoy this thoroughly- either a high end set of loudspeakers, may I suggest Klipsch Cornwalls or modified pair of Realistic Mach One/Two Series- the highs are crystal clear, and lows are so clear and extremely deep-ended. Vintage Stereo equipment will illustrate this album far better than today's run of the mill retailed audio.If you like rock-jazz, this album is for you. Hat's off to Donald Fagen, today's 'King of Cool'...But follow the advice on DVD-A players vs DVD-V players discussed here in the review section.If you use a DVD-V player, stick with the Audio CD release or LP of this recording."
2,This does not rock.,"There a many hibrid, cross-chart, FUSION albums trying to convey some sorts of various jazz/pop, in this misguided effort. This fusion pathology is the most likely the product of narrcissistic/ borderline artist. Well sometimes it works and mostly it doesn't. Miles, John McLaughlin and some have produced lasting listenable ""Morphed"" rock, jazz, new age gobbledegook. I have to hand it to Fagan; he's hanging in there with the predictable semi-surrealistic commentary and what appears on it's oh so memorable classics with Becker. The thrill is gone."
1,Slightly Better Than Junk,"How many plastic trees gave their lives for this toy? One is one too many.The sound, visuals and gameplay are worse than 1970's video games. The speed is so fast (you cannot adjust the speed) that you end up just hitting steps in random.I thought this would be a good toy because it is the dance game which you can plug directly into the TV; you don't have to own an additional game system.Skip this and get something else."
2,Poor Journalism,"I bought it as a photographer interested in improving my photo-journalism techniques and street photography generally. But this book - a text really - seems to be aimed at professional journalists, as much of the information is obviously intended for them. (eg: How to deal with your editor/boss etc) yet, it's too basic for professionals, unless, indeed, they are still studying journalism as a course. I found it to be poorly set-out and awfully presented. Perhaps it was intended to resemble a newspaper?! Poor photographic definition, bad type-face and bland and confusing overall presentation. It gave some good insights, but you had to search for them. Bill"
3,"Buy it if you have to, but look for a bargain price.","This book is the text for a course I took. Although there is some interesting material, the majority of it is way overdone."
2,Drama or Parody?,"Whether it's a drama or parody almost seems a moot point. More appropriately it can be asked: Why? In all seriousness it looked, sounded and played like a parody. Even beyond that, it seems almost sacrilegious to remake a film from the cinematic portfolio of Alfred Hitchcock. At best, this film is a curiosity piece for the not too curious film enthusiast."
1,I have not seen...,...this movie nor do I plan to after reading about on Wikipedia. Hithcock's Psycho was perfect and did not need to be remade!
3,"Well-Done, interesting.","In the realm of slasher thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" stands as the best.So why do we need a remake? The truth is, we don't. But who knows what Gus Van Sant was thinking when he decided to make a shot by shot remake of a classic. This new version is in color, has richer cinematography and some extra opticals inserted. So why do I give it three stars? I liked it on the level where even in the 90s ""Psycho"" can still be thrilling and intriguing in a weird, macabre way. I also liked watching it and comparing it with the original. Other than that, it's not really worth it considering Vince Vaughn is tragically mis-cast and we already know what's going to happen. The new ""Psycho"" should be passed over for the old. Besides, there is no difference anyway."
1,.,"It's true that it never should've been made, and it's equally true that it's a very poor remake. Why are the people of the 90s so obsessed with re-doing things that've been done well enough already? And always adding that ""hip, 90s spice"" to those things? It's sick, gaudy, soulless, and dull. As for the movie itself ... Vince Vaughn is atrociously poor and terribly miscast ... Anne Heche is adequate at best. I'm not sure about the rest because my interest lapsed in the first 30 minutes and I have to admit I only paid scarce attention for the remainder."
3,An okay remake of an OK movie,"OK, what was that stock footage all about when Norman killed the detective? It showed a naked woman and a cow getting hit by a car.Overall this movie was okay, but it just shows how even though you think the old films are great for their time, they're not so great for OUR time.(although some classics, like All About Eve, could be successful even now if it was remade properly)"
2,"its ok, but trust me WAIT!!!","i saw this movie in the theaters, and i was kinda disopointed about it, i loved the originol, and i was expecting a hole lot more, some of the scenes were so unnecesary, like norman masturbating, who wants to see that, and flashing rolling cloasd and bulls during the shower scene was so stupid!! it took it all away, and the music does not play till after sh turns around to see him/her theit witha knife, it doesnt play when he pulls the curtin back. although it was good, i give it 2 stars becuase it is only ok, i would not eve buy it for this much, i will wait till it drops to about 30$ becuase you can buy the originol wich is much better for about $9.99, and its better!!! so please trust me, and WAIT!!!"
2,Where's the scary part?,Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. This movie was simply not scary. It had no suspense at all. Everyone could have guest who the killer was after watching the first 30 minute of the movie. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
3,PSYCHO SOMATIC?,"Sure, it's not as good as the original. Vince Vaughn is not Anthony Perkins, and yes, he was probably miscast. Anne Heche fills Leigh's shoes okay; Viggo Mortensen is just like John Gavin in his somnolence; and Williah H. Macy digs in to Martin Balsam's role. Julianne Moore puts some unusual spunk in the ""featured"" role, and Van Sant did make it frame for frame. But still, the story and the production are still chilling and I'll still think of this every time I step into a shower. Better than the irreprehensible BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!!"
5,Come on....give it a chance!,"Being a Hitchcock buff and a great fan of PSYCHO, this new version has not been given a good response. Why is this so? Because we all feel that classic movies should not be re-made!While this new movie is bold and daring, thanks mainly to Vince Vaughn's extraordinary and brave interpretation of ""mild-mannered"" Norman Bates, its lacks the same calibre as Hitch's 1960 original. The cast is top-notch especially Vaughn, with his quick bird-like reflexes and canny laugh.The shower scene could have been elaborated a lot more ie: more blood and gore. This also applies to the second murder.I think this should be given a second chance...it may be flawed granted but this was a brave venture by Gus Van Sant."
4,Hitchcock would be proud!,"van sant's version of psycho was extremely enjoyable. although i am partial to Hitchcock's movie magic and janet leigh's brilliant performance as the doomed marion crane, van sant and anne heche pulled through like two old pros. Bravo! julianne moore must be given a standing ovation as well. her performance, i must say, rivals that of vera miles. oh, and mr. viggo, please, no more movies for you."
1,STAY AWAY if you have any decency!!!,"I just finished watching this movie and.....................I was never so disappointed in all my life. This movie is absolutely horrid. Save your money and spend it on the original 1960 film, which still gives me chills (even though I've seen it a dozen times), by Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense. I don't know what Universal was thinking when they allowed a director to do a remake of a timeless classic."
1,Insane!,Misguided and failing on every level this remake should be listed as THE example of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy. And what would possess the stellar supporting cast to join up with this carnival of stupidity? Every word of dialogue only serves to remind the viewer that they're watching some kind of backyard production compared to the irreplaceable original.What's next Gus? Redoing Gone with the Wind? Ben-Hur? Citizen Kane?
2,Psycho (1998),"This lame remake by Gus Van Sant is effortless and a waste of time anyway. Vince Vaughn has absolutely no comparison to the master, Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates and Anne Heche as Marion Crane, is a character I really do not feel sorry for. Janet Leigh was much better.This remake of Psycho is a remake in every sense of the word, having the majority (maybe 2 or 3 words have been changed) of the lines from the original kept, and the shots are pretty much the same. The crew has also added some unnecessary things such as the crude shots of bare bottoms and sideview breast shots. And what was up with the cow in the middle of the road and the blind-folded lady when the detective comes flying down the stairs???This is an awful remake and really embarrasses all the cast and crew involved. A waste of time in the making and in the viewing. Don't rent it and certainly do not buy it."
2,Another useless remake,"In the original Pycho, there was suspense, intrigue, and shock. In Gus Van Sant's remake of the excellent original, he merely mimicked camera angles, dialogue, and positioning. Yet, he missed the fealing of the film by a longshot. Vince Vaughn (Normand) was horribly disguised as an old woman. It was obvious that he was ""mother"" by his quick, agile movements. The only fun part about watching this movie is comparing it to the original, which is a BIG laugh! However, the actors/actresses are minorly interesting to watch. With the exception of Viggo Mortenson. He does an awful job of pulling off his character"
1,I thought this thing was supposed to be scary??,"I was looking for a good horror movie...thought this was it..NOT. I have never seen the original but if it was anything like this, I can't imagine what all the hoopla was about. This was a boring, boring movie. The plot was not hard to figure out before you were halfway into it. It seemed as if the famous ""shower scene"" happened way too soon, with little build up...you know the kind...the kind that keeps you on the edge of your seat. For this to be some kind of ""remake"" of a classic...one has to wonder what was so great about it to begin with. Did they leave that part out?"
3,Norman's Five-Knuckle Shuffle...,"... was actually written into Joseph Stefano's 1959 revision of the original Hitchcock script. Hitch didn't even shoot it, for Hayes Code purposes.Van Sant was honoring that deletion in his flawed remake. I believe, it too was included in Robert Bloch's novel.Make no mistake, Norman was always intended to whack it to Marion's bathing visage..."
1,This is going to be lengthy....,yuck. oh wait....it has to be 20 words long... yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck....well I guess I might be a little biased. Psycho is my favorite Hitchcock movie. but this is just so awful in so many ways. But not quite as bad as Madonna's remake of Swept Away....
1,Slow and rushed I find,"From the days I was Young I enjoy the orginal ""Psycho"" then this one was be madeand I though finally One for our generations boy I was Wrong!Anne Heche Is wasted in the role and Vince Vaughn Will never be ANthony Perkins.Theres a scene where in the orginal Norman was talking with Marion and he dominated the scene making it very creepy and in this one Anne domaniteds the scene.A real Dissapointment! Psycho A+ Psycho""98"" F"
1,"Perfect Cooler, not perfect delivery",Great cooler and the hard liner makes it very easy to clean. The low key exterior makes it perfect for discreet use in hotels that discourage mini-bar competition.Low rating based on Target's slopping handling (product was cut when unpacked from China) and their inability to replace it.
1,Not The Secret History,One of the worst books I have ever read. I had read it based upon recommendations from readers of The Secret History by Donna Tarrt which I thought was brilliant. This book is not.
4,Good Enough To Finish,"This is the first of Carol Goodman's books I have ever read, and the cover pages notes this is a debut novel. I wouldn't classify it ""gothic"" and it probably should be in the ""mystery"" section however, it was good enough to finish. I have to agree with other reviewers - I definately figured it out pretty early in the book, both the ""who"" of who dunnit, and the ""who"" of who she was with May Day. With that said, the book was definately a good read, too much latin, yet I did want to see how it ended. The ending was a little rushed, but satisfying. I will be curious to see how Ms Goodman's other novels compare."
3,To Put it Succinctly,"If Donna Tartt's _The Secret History_ were the Addams Family, Goodman's _The Lake of Dead Languages_ would be the Munsters."
3,A good book with a Great cover!,"I heard this book reviewed on the Today show so I bought it. The story has an excellent plot and the writing is strong. The setting and scenery evoke a wonderfully sinister mood of winter in upstate New York at a private girl's school. The lead character is strong and their are plenty of suspects along the way. As a male, I had hoped it would have been a bit more compelling in terms of the crimes and the lack of male suspects. You never really understand everything that happened but you are told most of the hard facts by the end of the story. I would have expanded the ending and conclusion to a few more chapters rather than profess all details in the final few pages. Don't get me wrong, it was totally enjoyable, however, I think it is geared more towards women and teenage girls. I would definately read another one of her books. And by the way, there are no figures floating on the lake on my book cover. What's up with that?"
2,Bleh.,"Jane Hudson, the protagonist of this overwrought and under-written book, is a supposedly bright woman who, nevertheless, can't seem to put two and two together. The plot is intricate, but only in the way a train wreck is intricate.The story depends heavily on a series of unlikely omissions and on Jane's apparent inability to recognize... well, just about anybody, ever.Descriptions are sparse and clumsy and, in most cases, act as little more than an excuse for awkward foreshadowing, hastily introducing a character trait or prop just in time for it to be used, a few pages later, to advance the increasingly unlikely plot.A barely passable mystery, all in all, but not worthy of the comparisons it has drawn with Donna Tartt's far superior _Secret History._"
4,Very Enjoyable!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It held my interest, and made me want more. There were great descriptions very vivid."
3,"There were times that I really liked this book, and then...","I really found myself absorbed in this book for the first couple of hundred pages. I thought about it throughout the day and looked forward to reading it in bed each night. I had some problem with the characters' obsessions with Latin and the odd pagan rituals surrounding the lake, but I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the storyline. As the novel continued, though, the plot became more and more problematic, predictable, and just sort of creepy. The novel had great intentions but didn't quite deliver. I would try another book by this author, though, because I did like her writing style, but I can't really say that I recommend this book."
2,Too Predictable,"This book essentially rips off The Secret History by Donna Tart. While the storylines are different in some ways there similarities are too many to ignore. The focus on Classical Studies, the reenactment of ancient Greek rituals...those things aside the book doesn't develop characters well (it's hard to tell apart Jane Hudson's three female students, all we know is they are goth and take her latin class) and the plot ""twists"" are utterly predictable. Who is the person secretly stalking Jane? I figured it out almost immediately. What is the big secret that Domina Chambers tells Lucy? Not too tough to grasp if you read a little into how the woman treats Lucy...And what was that ending? It was painful to read. Everything is wrapped up in a nice neat little package. Again, it was utterly predictable.The book had potential, I liked the basic ideas but they just weren't developed effectively."
4,a little too late,"this looks like a great product, too bad i already had everything hooked up, it would have saved me a lot of time...[PYLE PLAM14 20 Feet 8 Gauge 1000 Watts Amplifier Hookup For Battery Head Unit and Speakers Installation Kit"
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I was very interested in this item given the price and everything it includes. But, what everyone says is right. The actual width of the wire is 8 gauge; but the wire itself is 12 gauge. You're paying for insulation. Also, the hardware is cheap and not durable at all. Save your money and get something else."
3,got the job done,got the job done but i found out after the install that the wire isnt the claimed gauge. go to walmart and get their true-claim wires for about the same price. scosche is way better quality.
1,hurtful,I found the pictures in this book to be very distasteful. My brother's skull (Sheldon) shouldn't be viewed by anyone.
4,Great product,"I'm a casual photographer and I don't have a permanent studio so I needed a backdrop that could be set up and taken down quickly. It also needed to be versatile and durable. For the price, the Savage Port-A-Stand was exactly what I was looking for. It's a breeze to set up and dismantle and comes with a handy carrying case for easy storage. Although the included paper is a bonus it has generally been too narrow for my needs. So I'd recommend that anyone purchasing this item consider how much width they will require and consider buying a wider seamless. Outside of that I am very pleased with this product."
5,The dog doesn't bark now.,"Had the 10R model for a couple years for our larger dog, but it was way too big and heavy for our 11 lb. terrier. This model is much lighter and works well. The first unit has a sensor issue but was replaced with an extra collar by the factory. They have excellent customer service."
2,Mediocre,"If you liked the sound of ""Punk Song"" on the first album then buy this one. If you liked the darker (better) songs then don't waste your time. There's only a couple here that match the intensity on the first album and even those aren't as good. I guess it's another 2+ year wait for another attempt."
1,simply terrible and pointless,"you won't remember any of these songs after you've auditioned this disc: there are no strong melodies or innovative musical turns. shameless rip off of a great band (jesus and marychain) who wrote deceptively simple lyrics. the lyrics here are just seemingly penned by simpletons. much better CDs in this dreamy category were released this year by the black watch (awesome songwriting--kinda like the house of love), sun kil moon (wonderful return of red house painters' frontguy), and robyn hitchcock (the acoustic ""Luxor""). the languid (read: airhead) rock by these poseurs (you have heard the term associated with black rebel a zillion times now) is a sham. look up the aforementioned discs instead..."
1,BRMC really does suck,"This band has no impact point in their music...no pauses, no nifty chord changes. They turn on the amps, buzz, and play nothing that is interesting nor inspired. It's like if Marilyn Manson was the lead singer of a crappy, angry uninspired band. Wait..."
4,The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club Delivers,"I've been a fan of this band since the first album, which is itself a very good introduction to this three-piece. The material is very good: at times they sound innocent and vulnerable, other times wild and sexually charged, and other times full of bile and loathing. In each case it delivers savage blows from start to finish, promising never to let up until the last notes resound. With all that said, not only does their followup, 2003's ""Take Them On, On Your Own"", deliver on that promise, but it bludgeons the listener with even more fuzzy guitars and excellent songs. My only qualm with this is that the album is chock full of excellent pop songs, and therefore paints less of a story in my mind, whereas the debut had pop songs bridged by litte interludes like ""If I'd have been Jesus"" and ""Take My Time"". Still very highly recommended."
1,It does not work w/Windows 98SE...,"They say it does, but I've had mine since last June and I still get an error everytime I turn on the computer. It will acknowledge that there's a router nearby, but it refuses to connect.I've had problems with installing it as well. It would request the Windows 98SE disk that came with the computer, and when I inserted the disk, it would say it couldn't find what it was looking for.Motorola tech support is no help, b/c I asked them what was wrong and they said I needed to download drivers, but that wasn't the case. I just needed to find the cabs file in my Windows folder. An easy fix that I had to find from a random tech site.I'm currently shopping for another adapter, so if you have Win98SE, I would strongly recommend NOT buying this adapter."
3,Bad condition,This item was definitely in a used condition. I have only used it a few times and I already feel like its falling apart and will break any day. Also the picture did not match the item I received. Not even close! The color is completely off along with the condition of the picture to my item. Definitely a bad choice for me.
3,Easily Broken,"This nerf gun may look cool on the outside but mine broke. To find the problem I took it apart and the tigger had broken. The arm that presses the air valve is under a lot of pressure, and it's also made from plastic. After just a few months of use it snapped. Final word: WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!"
1,i bought this gun for my son's birthday,after about a week the air chamber inside broke and it could no longer shoot save your money and by another toy for your kid
1,terrible!!!!!,I had the Rapid Fire 20 for a total time of 1 day and it jammed and the gun stopped rapid firing and it sucks!!!!!!
5,"If you're a SERIOUS nerfer, READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Okay, let's get started:THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST NERF BLASTERS KNOWN TO MAN!!!!!!!!! First of all, you've got TWO firing modes! Plus, it makes a machine-gun-like sound when you fire it! Also, I've read all the horror stories of kids being ROUGH with this baby, and complain that it's a piece of CRAP. If you're careful with this blaster, it shouldn't break. Also, it takes FOREVER to re-load and pump, but if you've got cover fire from other nerfers in a NERF war, this is a VERY powerful asset. Now, some tips: don't be rough with this gun, don't over-pump it, and fire in bursts to conserve ammo. HAPPY NERFING!!!"
5,A Nerfers Dream,This is a pretty good gun if you like automatics.Its prettypretty durable and great for suprise attacks.The earlyerverstion isn't that durable and NOT WORTH BUYING!
2,Rapid Fail,"We are active Cube Warriors, and i purchased this to gain an edge. This Nerf weapon is not what i was expecting. with the massive amount of pumps require to even unload 1/2 of the darts, it takes too much time when under fire. I think if you could mod this with a CO2 cartrige or hook it directly to an air compressor it would help you gain the superior firepower i had hoped for. I do not reccomend this to my fellow Cube Warriors."
5,I Have a Great Sleeping Baby!!!,"I am so happy that I finally found a book to help me get my baby sleeping through the night AND taking great long naps. It's such an easy technique and I probably could have figured it all out myself, but for some reason just didn't or couldn't. This book was such an easy read and got me right on track to what I needed to know to get my little angel falling asleep without me. Thank you, thank you, thank you! This will be a peaceful and well rested house from now on, and that's for sure."
2,Dissapointing,"I generally found this album uninspiring. The electronics are somewhat laggard, and the beats have been done before."
1,Author is a Nazi skinhead,"The author of this book, Matt Buschbacher, is a neo-Nazi who engaged in white supremacist activities throughout his stint as a Navy Seal (see the Southern Poverty Law Center's website) prior to penning this garbage. While Buschbacher wants us all to take into account peoples' status as Black, Jewish, or homosexual, and he has advocated violence against the aforementioned people through his involvement with hate groups, he wants us to ignore his disgusting past and make him rich by purchasing this dribble. Don't buy this book. Buschbacher is about as good of an author as he is a human being."
4,"A Great, Quick Read","Although ""The Voice of the Night"" doesn't have some of the deep philosophy and ingruiging mysticism that some of Koontz's books have, it's still a great novel. It's interesting from the beginning, and builds smoothly to the conclusion...I finished it in a day and a half! Although it's not particularily frightening, it is certainly suspenseful. Also, the characters and superbly realistic and I must admit I identified with the hero of the story. :-)The only thing that I might say against this book is that it contained a fairly simple plot and was rather short. However, the ending is satisfying and it makes a great point about human nature, putting this near the top of my list of Koontz's books."
1,Did we read the same book?,"I picked up this book based on all the favorable reviews here. From the beginning it was slow. The dialogue between the characters is stilted and unrealistic, especially between Colin and his mother. This story just seemed to be all over the place, and just when it was getting interesting, the story ended abruptly. I like Dean Koontz but this book is awful."
2,It's not worth the bother,"I love Dean Koontz, but this book was just a waste of time. Character development, what's that? The story has been done before. In all honesty, you might like it, I however did not. Whatever you do, borrow it from someone if you must read it. Don't waste your money."
4,the voice of the night,"i love dean koontz. i will read almost anything he has written. good plot, realistic people represented. will rad it again, i am sure."
1,Why no text to speech?,I would pay extra for text t speech.But I will not consider this book. I am disappointed.
1,Jeez! What a creepy novel!,"Jeez! What can I say? I threw this book in the trash. I have read about five Koontz novels and for the most part I enjoyed them. But...this is an abomination of the one star degree. Every single aspect of this novel is weak. The plot, the characters, the scenes...Bah! It is about as solid as string cheese. Another problem is that the dialogue comes in chunks, and the exposition comes in chunks; the two hardly ever mingle in a chapter. BAD. Koontz should have left Brian Coffey responsible for this one."
2,Mediocre at Best,"The characters just did not behave in a believable way. The story kept me mildly interested, but was certainly not engrossing. At times this book is slow, and at its worst points it is boring."
3,It's just so so,"As another reviewer has said, this is a typical teen sex comedy. There's nothing really special about it. It's just 3 guys that go on a cougar hunting trip. Then, later you will have 2 guys wanting cougars and one guy just wanting love. This is where Jillian Murray comes in and she HOT! I thought the jokes weren't that good as I would had been. The acting is okay compared to other stuff I seen.Another reviewer said this movie made in to the theaters first, and I didn't know that. I thought this movie was a direct to DVD movie, because it sure felt like.Don't waste your money and buy this movie. This is a pure rental."
1,This book is all ego,"I was hoping for a book about the Hudson River. What I got was a smug self-portrait by two guys who think they, and they alone, are the river's salvation. I wanted to learn less about Cronin's and Kennedy's coming-of-age stories, and more of the Hudson and its predicament. The necessary book about the Hudson is, I suppose, yet to be written."
4,Does not work on XBox 360,"Buyer beware, this game will not play on the XBox 360, only the original XBox (it is not upgradeable). However, NBA Street Volume 3 does work on the XBox 360. My son ranks Volume 3 as ""pretty fun""."
4,Helpful for the first time mom!,Great for the first time mom who is confused about what she should feed her child. Also has recipes for playdoo and silly putty too.
5,Buddy!,"This is an amazing series of performances by two of the best guitarists, including Buddy Emmons, who rules on steel. ""Song of India"" is a powerhouse of give and take."
3,What might have been.,"This record was recorded in the midst of SRV's resurgence. The In Step tour with Jeff Beck had just ended and Jimmy, fresh out of rehab, was in need of a project to resurrect his career. With a mix of songs written both individually and collaboratively, Family Style was the end product. This was neither the hard blues from Double Trouble or guitar pop of the T-birds. We find ourselves in the middle. I recommend this record not so much for the music but as a souvenir of the love of two brothers and their talent."
1,Griffin iMic review,"This thing is pretty much a piece of junk. The cost of making this item has got to be less than $5 and it looks it. What's worse is that it doesn't really serve any useful purpose as there is significant noise on the microphone input. As best as I can tell the quality of the line input is no better (or worse) than what one could get by going directly to the line input on the computer, but with the noise on the mic input this thing really isn't a good substitute for a powered mic. All in all, not worth having."
3,Better options for same price,After I got the iMic I read some technical reviews that said it had poor sound quality compared to other options. A similar item Behringer USB Audio Input/Output Adapter was rated as better quality and was about the same price. I got one and did a direct comparison. The Behringer sounded noticably better and had much better construction (sturdy metal instead of plastic and a better cable).
5,Saved me!,"I have a lot of audio cassettes with jazz from my dad I wanted to digitize. The problem is that I have a laptop, so there is no way to connect the deck to the computer's soundcard. This device saved my day! And the price is great, too."
3,not so bad,I recorded a house mix. The sound is kinda flat. There's no depth to the music. The bass is a little flat that you just can't get that ooomph you need. But its ok. I really didn't expect much for its price
4,Griffin iMic performs well.,"I have many audio tapes which I wanted to put on iTunes. With just a tape deck and the iMic adapter, I have been able to accomplish that. I really haven't noticed any significant loss in fidelity (not enough to affect iTunes playing, anyway). Hook-up is simple. I did not use the supplied software. Instead, I used ""Audio Hijack"" which recognized the iMic input right away. I cannot evaluate the software's ease of use, however I am very satisfied with the hardware interface."
3,"A little pricey, but works good","The iMic has done its job. However, I wasn't fully aware of what that job was when I bought it. The iMic will not boost your guitar level. So, when you try to record the guitar, you have to crank the gain up so high it is terribly noisy if you use any distorted sounds. You will still need some type of preamp to run your guitar through to get an acceptable level. I use the Digitech GNX3 or an ADA MP2. That was the only thing that would get rid of the noise. One positive is that it does the D/A conversion outside of the computer which helps reduce noise."
1,The Worst CD Ever Made!,This is one of the worst cds I've ever bought...The only way it's worth my money is to put it on the concrete and crush it with a hammer so no one else has to hear this dreadful singer...Sorry but that's how I feel...If your thinking of buying this cd Please listen to it before you do because I would have to say it SUX!!!
4,Very listenable,"Tim McGraw has a way of touching your heart with his music. His softer side comes through more so than most other male country music artists. This is a warm and heartfelt cd and is very refreshing to listen to. As far as country music, you really can't go wrong with this cd."
1,Crudtacular,"It is egotistical, sexist, and extremely boring. Go ahead. Waste your time AND your money!"
3,correcting a reviewer,"i'm a long time fan of low and i also love electronic music. sure this cd will come as a shock to harcore low fans but, it's really not that bad. also, alan told me personally at a show in atl. when the cd was released that, ""he did not have a problem with the artists"" he said nothing about not liking the mixes. sure electronica artists on other labels like morr music, fat cat or even kranky could have done better but, hey! the fact that the project ever happened with such diverse styles is a plus in that idea alone! buy it used, i bet you will like at least 2 songs!"
1,the original beauty of the songs was destroyed by remixers,"i very much enjoy LOW's music. i listened to this twice. i think it sucks. yes, the songs were re-mixed. so what? they sound horrible. the original beauty of the songs was destroyed by remix artists. LOW isn't happy with this remix project either.i recommend the live album ""one more reason to forget"". it presents what is greatest about LOW... the awesome unique sound they create."
4,A nice electronic punk-rock group,"I got the album after finding the band on Myspace years ago. I heard the song bratcore, which isn't likely on this album-but is on youtube- and enjoyed it. The other stuff wasn't quite to my taste at the time. I really like the songs Mega God Blas, Really Something Destroy, and Do you wanna triumph?. It's not quite everybody's taste, and the singer does in fact sound like he's drunk and slurring at times, but if you're a fan of electronic-oriented music, punk-rock and its various upbeat tempos, you just might like this. I would recommend if you're not sure if you want to risk paying for the album, to get either a track or two, or just play the samples. Also if you listen to this, headphones/decent speakers are a must. I added the tracks entirely to my phone, and it doesn't sound quite too good from the phone's poor speaker, but through headphones the bass-guitar and keyboard sounds great."
3,Informative if Inconvenient,"I have had a copy of this book around since the 1970's. It is hard to find all the ingredients that are present in our everyday household substances, but if you are willing to do a little scrounging, you can make most of the items you use in everday life and save quite a bit of money. Read the ingredient list of most of the liquids you use at home and you will find that water (or alcohol) is almost always the first or second ingredient. Make your own shampoo and hand lotion and you can save money and feel empowered! A fun book to read and reminds you of the days when our grandparents were self sufficient and made their own soap, ointments, liniments, and minor medical supplies."
5,string algae,"I have a small (150-200 gallon) ornamental pond in the front of my house. it gets full sun all day. before the lilly pads can even get a chance to grow & start shading my pond, the string algae takes over. for the third year in a row, i have used this product with great success. i have live plants and fish in my pond and have had a lot of difficulty finding a product that will kill the algae without killing either the fish or the plants or sometimes both! I highly recommend this product."
1,Do NOT USE! Fish nightmare!,"Algae fix, is a horrible fish murdering product. No one should sell this product - nightmare stories all over the internet and now a nightmare in my tank! My Fish are still very very sick days after using less than the recommended dose. I had to remove my guppies within minutes as the looked half dead, several hours later all my other fish became very ill. I performed a 50% water change and 30 hours later my fish are still twitching and won't eat. They almost appear to be blind. Oh my water is crystal clear but who cares about the water if the fish die! Google Algae Fix dead fish - this has happened to many users of this product!"
4,Smart Buy,It makes total sense to purchase this extension kit. Gives the Playzone a bit more room for my daughter to roam around in.
4,Good for safety containment!,"With a 2 year old brother, our very active 11 month grandson was not always as safe as we would like him to be while needing to tend to our 2 year old. This ""play fort"" as we called it worked wonderfully. While potty training the 2 year old, the baby was safe but interested in the ""fort"". In reverse, the 2 year old used his ""fort"" as a private place to play without having his blocks knocked down by his baby brother. We also have used the flexible configuration to corall ""play dough"" time by the older child...Mom and Dad have been known to have their ""time out""s in the playspace as well!!! Good product!!!"
3,A must for collectors - get it while it lasts!,"Sure there are better albums by Perry, but this is a rare one and as such is a must have for any serious collector. I have mixed feelings about the tracks offered here, although when you put it in the historical perspective it still sounds great almost three decades later. Production quality also varies heavily. For a single slice of Perry's best work I would probably go with ""Arkology"" set. On this one, pay attention to Ethiopia, a very nice dub with some smooth sax to spice it up. This may be the only CD you'll find this track on. Liner notes are pretty poor (like most of Perry's albums) and no one even gets credit for the sax playing. I also like Irie Irie with some out of sync cool drunken piano work. I don't think this track is available elsewhere (this is an instrumental version of Iry Iry from Stay Red).[...]"
4,Harry Nillson Personal Best,"Just like the name says, these songs are the highlights of his career. Check out his version of the Beatles' ""You Can't Do That"" which precedes their ""Love"" album collage by a few decades!"
2,father time slows the texas tornado,"it has been over a decade since johnny winter has recorded a studio album, the excellent 1993 album wheres your brother. since then struggles with illness and substance abuse have quieted the mad albino resulting in a much different album than any of his previous releases. gone are the growling vocals and the blistering solos replaced by a softer wispy voice and carefully played solos by a musicians who realizes his limitations. the best songs on the album are the acoustic ones that don't overwhelm his softer vocals and complement his more laidback style. it's when we get the the harder electric blues that the album really suffers and makes you long for the days when johnny winter was the unquestioned king of white american blues."
4,Is this Johnny?,"I was being kind giving 4 stars. He's losing his voice.If you didn't know it was Johnny, you'd never guess it.Old age gets us all in time. THE GUITAR'S STILL THEIRTHOUGH!!"
3,Winter Hours...,"I am a huge Johnny Winter fan, first and foremost. I knew going in this CD might have some missing qualities, due to what he's gone through the past couple of years.Consider a palsy that paralyzed his right hand, hip replacement surgery and heaven knows what else, the fact that Winter is alive and still making music is a wonder.The blazing speed of past recordings is not the same, but it's soulful, gutsy blues guitar...just what I wanted.Vocally, Winter reminds me of aging blues singers who still had the soul and skill, but it had changed. Winter almost sounds like he had a mild stroke, as his voice doesn't sound as articulate as it once was.But the band is good, and one thing is for sure--Winter pours everything into it."
2,"Something of a disappointment, but to be expected.","Johnny Winter is something of a hero of mine. I love his stuff and listen to it often. In the last 20 years, his career and output have, to say the least, been uneven. I gather he has faced his share of personal problems in this period and I think this album shows it. I had hoped he would return from the wilderness with a stronger will and powerful band, but it was not to be. This is an average album with below average playing by Winter. I think that age has finally caught up to him, and that he has not gotten better in recent years, just weaker. I wish him well and hope that he will improve over time."
4,Covers Its Topic Well,"I've bought 3 Editions of this book (1995, 2001, 2002). It was worth buying a new edition from the 1995 to 2001 gap; it really wasn't from 2001 to 2002... Hardly anything changed, so I learned a very disappointing lesson there.I like this series since it concentrates on Kids (from infants to teenagers); it offers great advice... If you're like us, you'll probably ignore most of it, and then look back and say ""Hey, she's pretty smart!""As a general guide, however, it leaves me underwhelmed. The Restaurant Reviews in particular are done at a very high level just to establish the ""kid"" factor. For a general guide, I much prefer Bob Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide. In addition, Sehlinger covers kids in great detail with very similar advice. If I only had one book to buy, I would pick Sehlinger's book over Wiley's in a heartbeat.Some people are put off by Sehlinger's ""tell-it-like-it-is"" style and consider him anti-Disney. Wiley is the opposite and rarely says a negative word."
3,"Huge Priest fan, pretty good album","This live album is somewhat the antithesis of their seminal live album, 1979's ""Unleashed in the East"". That one was scaled down, fast, and raw. In fact, I think they hurt the songs by not giving them thick crunch and dialing back on the RPM. Rising does justice to classics like Ripper, Exciter, and Green Manalishi, which should be played mid-tempo (or slightly slower) to bring out their power. OTOH, I routinely skip Breaking the Law, Living After Midnight, etc., because they're live pop staples and ehh. In fact, it seems they've slowed all the songs down so that he doesn't have to sing as fast. As I said a moment ago, that's actually a good thing. One odd thing about Rob is that he actually looks better older. Ok, maybe not 55 old -- though he still has plenty of charisma -- but when he was younger he actually looked too ""pretty boy"" to pull of the metal thing. If you like old metal, you'll enjoy this album, even though Rob's voice is shot on it."
3,"great concert, not so great dvd",Poorly authored DVD - could have been made better and could have included more stuff. Great to see Judas Priest in action though.
4,Gets Better With Age,"I agree with some of the others that say Rob's voice is lacking, but just it seems to get better the further you get into the show. I was ready to turn the DVD off after the first few songs because he sounded pretty bad and drowned out by the band, but by the time ""Judas Rising"" rolls around it's as if the old Rob has returned. I actually think he does a good job with the high notes; it's some of the normal lyrics that sound rough. But by the time we get to ""Victim Of Changes,"" all that is forgotten. And as usual, KK and Glen and the rhythm section don't miss a lick! Not as good as the Memphis show (23 years ago), but definitely a keeper."
4,ALMOST FIVE,"A great CD all around. From SRV BLUES to straight BLUES to ROCK with a bit of FUSION and some very cool instrumental tracks, it's all here and not one weak track. This is another outstanding guitarist that had to work for 20 years to become an overnight sensation. Well he should be anyway. I love discovering these gems and rarely regret it. Buying this without knowing a thing about the man or his musik proved a good idea after all and more PRINCIPATO will follow. If you like any of the above styles, this should be in your collection. It is so much fun to watch the curious faces of my guests over drinks, trying to figure out who this might be and inevitably failing while being unable to control their tapping feet."
3,A bit disappointing,"I was really excited to read this book after I had finished The Passionate One. Its sad to say I was disappointed with this book. I expected a follow up of Ash and Rhihannon, but there wasnt. I enjoyed the book more towards the end when the book picked up its pace. Raine and Favors relationship was beautiful."
3,Unbelievable,"The book starts out good and is going great. It is hard to believe that Raine would go home and not confront his father. He could then look for the treasure with ease. He certainly could have attempted to explain to Favor that if she married him she would also have the Merrick name and would have as Raine's wife been able to live in the McClairen castle. If she truly believed that all she had to do was go the Italy and wait until Carr died and then she would inherit her husband Carrs property. Wrong, scotland law would not prevail, English law would as scotland was under English law. The title Earl of Carr would have passed to the eldest brother in the Merrick line and certainly Raine could have gotten the property Favor wanted from his brother. It is still a good book by Connie Brockway and I am looking forward to Fia's story."
2,"a big let down, boring","I enjoyed the first book in this series, The Passionate One, and I never like to not finish a series so I bought the other two. Well I was very disappointed by this book. The story dragged, the plot was dull and the characters never really came alive for me. I hope the third book is better."
5,Great product ... even better price,"This is my second JBL iPod docking station. I also have the larger version, which has better sound, but also costs more. I use the smaller one on my desk at work and it is perfect. The remote is also handy. I also love that it so much cheaper online that in your typical retail store."
5,Read this book,"This is a great book. Its simple, precise style and its focus on detail of everyday life convey the horrors, which are mostly left out of the narrative but which hover above and beyond it, so that the effect is as unsettling as anything one is bound to read on the H. This book should be reissued so that it can reach many more readers."
1,Reason the rating was changed.,Some people believe it was a mod that added content to the GTA:SA. but the mod wasnt a mod at all but unlocked content that was already in the game. Without the mod however there was no way to get the hidden scene. On the console version you have to use a gameshark or similar device.
1,Waste of Money,"What an utter waste of money. You can get 160 minutes of music on 2 CDs and they expect you to pay all this money for 90 minutes worth. At least the 1 album used up all the disc space. Can't they just make a 1 vol. 2 to add the tracks they couldn't fit on 1. For good continuity they could call it ""2"""
1,Very dull account of the social impact of Eminem,"This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book."
4,Not a bio.,"This is a great book if you want to read about Eminem and the hip hop/rap history, but if you need to read a biography this isn't really the right book. The fisrt 2 or 3 pages of each chapter is about the time Bozza spent with Eminem, nothing about him. I am pretty much obsessed with Eminem, so I enjoyed this book."
1,Wow! This is shockingly bad!,"I bought this CD because I thought it would be interesting to hear Harry S. Truman's amateur piano playing, which I expected the modern professional musicians who made this album were going to jazz up with accompaniment. Instead, the people who made this CD got ""artistic"" and did all kinds of weird things with sound effects. I'm sure ""Give 'em hell"" Harry would be giving these people hell for making an unlistenable album using his playing, which was probably not meant for public consumption in the first place. This CD is truly, shockingly bad. I do listen to tracks 1 and 3 occasionally because you can at least make out Truman's piano playing in those tracks."
2,Hold your horses - look back for a while!,"It's very clear that something happened to ZZ Top after releasing the ground breaking ""Eliminator"". On that album, ZZ Top did it more or less naturally but since it became such a huge success, they couldn't let go. ZZ Top have two separate directions - the pre-Eliminator when they were a great blues band making excellent music, and then there's the modern ZZ Top trying too hard to make another ""Eliminator"". I would prefer if the little band from Texas took some time to look in the review mirror - maybe they'd discover what made them special in the first place. ""Antenna"" may not be an awful album but it sure can't compete with anything before ""Eliminator""."
1,Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)-Vinyl Release,"This review is for the vinyl release of 36 Chambers. The album itself is classic, no need to review the content, rather I am reviewing the quality of the pressing. It is terrible! Don't waste your money, it sounds as if it was pressed using a dubbed cassette as the master tape. It's all muddy mids. It's as if no one listened to it after it was pressed. Shame on the folks who were responsible for this debacle. Can't give it zero stars for some reason, but that's what it deserves"
1,Says Explicit Lyrics but it's censored!!,What the hell?? I got my all time favorite hip-hop album and what a disappointment!!! Protect ya Neck is censored!!! They put this funny noise when they say the 'bad words'!!! The thing is Amazon's product info said explicitly EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! Come on!!!!!! Had it been the real deal I would have most definitely rated the product FIVE stars!! What a disappointment...It even features the Parental Advisory thing on the cover!
1,Weak excuse for a rap group.. stick with Lil Wayne for REAL gansta rap.,"Wuzup ya'll? I love hip-hop to the fullest.. my favorite rappaz are Fred Durst, Kid Rock, Lil Wayne, Vanilla Ice, Young Jeezy, Ja Rule, and Soulja boy.. but these Wu-Tang fellaz are WACK! These guys can't rhyme to save their life and they have no real undaground feel.... The Song ""bring da ruckers"" makes no sense and doesn't have a catchy beat at all! These posers should take a few lessons from Lil Wayne and Pitbull if they want to be successful in the music world!Be sure to avoid stupid wanna-be rap groups like Run DMC, Wu Tang, Public Enemy, NWA, and those annoying Beaties Boyz!!"
1,this rap sucks!!!,"I used to love the wu-tang clan. It was the first rap cd I ever bought. But after I started buying better cds like mobb deep, the pharcyde, flimode squad, and all types of techno, I noticed how crappy, and how comercial the wu-tang clan had become. The wu-tang clan are full of them selves, and the whole ""shaolin"", and ""ninja"" crap, is just Retarted."
1,WTF?,"I love rap. But Wut Tang is garbage. With high expectations I heard this album, and im like WTF is this. its trash, pure trash. the beats are horrible, and the lyrics are too.W U T A N G S T I N K S B A D L Y."
4,a powerful cool listen!,"forceful rhymes, made imagery, cool production. If you take away the historic significance of this album in hip hop, it's only a 4.5 , but i'll give it a 4, it's only fair...We've all heard much better lyrics and much better production in our time, but this is a great collection of tracks and the beginning and a downslyding repetoire.peace,"
5,Best Group Of All Time,"Not just rap, best group ever. 9 people (Excluding Cappadonna) that can construct great solo and group efforts and this is where it started. Still gritty nd grimey but Wu-Tang Forever is the better listen but this album is where you should start for the full Wu experience."
3,Average,"Not as funny as normal Black movies, but it does have a big heart. predictatble but still fun. An easy movie to watch."
4,Jack Black in his element,"We netflixed this one last night ... and I thought the movie was pretty funny. If it had been a bit shorter - I would have enjoyed it more. Jack Black is obviously having a great time in this movie - using his Tenacious D skills and his over-the-top humor with a really talented group of kids. (Actuallym, I found the DVD extras far more hilarious than the actual film. Black seems to be really genuine with the kids - not putting on a show.) In short ... funny film and don't miss the DVD extras"
1,"Jack Black is great, but this movie is terrible...","I don't know what this movie is rated, but it might as well have been G. This movie is a embarrassment to rock 'n roll.I really like Jack Black. He's got a great sense of humor and he's always saying the funniest stuff, but this movie is just not very funny.For the most part, there's a few laughs, but I found myself not laughing at things that were supposed to be funny.I was really trying to enjoy it, but towards the end I gave up. After seeing Jack Black's slap stick humor for an hour, it get's old and that's what this movie completely relies on.We left the theater in a bad mood and my girlfriend said, ""I'm not letting you pick the movie next time""."
3,A Megadose of Jack Black,"If you love Jack Black, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, probably not so much, as it relies heavily on large doses of Black in the starring role as a grimacing, hyperkinetic ruffian bent on turning a bunch of fifth graders into punkish rockers. Joan Cusack lends just the right amount of support as the uptight principal of the stuffy private school where Black's subversive activities take place. It's all great fun in a PG sort of way, but you really have to work hard at suspending disbelief most of the time. Thumbs up, but not WAY up."
3,School of Rock,"School of Rock was a halfway decent movie, but it kind of tells you something when you're not really laughing at the star of the movie, but at the other people in smaller roles. The children in this movie are the best thing about it, and they make all of the funny scenes funny, not Jack Black. In fact, I think Jack Black is what holds this movie back from getting a higher rating from me. He was just not funny in this movie. However, the story is decent, although it has been done plenty of times before, and the kids in the movie are just fun to watch."
4,Rock On!,"A big, fun, good-natured romp for Jack Black who plays an unsuccessful musician turned substitute teacher who ends up teaching a bunch of uptight prep school kids how to rock out. The cast is excellent, the kids are adorable, the script is really well written. My only regret is that the hilariously edgy comedian Sarah Silverman was given such a limited role as the shrewish girlfriend. But aside from that, I highly recommend this film!"
5,TAILOR MADE ROLE FOR BLACK! TOUGH TO DISLIKE!,Black is his usual over the top self in this very funny crowd pleaser. The supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. Throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. The original release on DVD has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.
3,Rent don't buy,"the first time you watch it its pretty funny, But i dont think its worth watching a second time because besides jack black being funny its the only good part about it"
2,not for me,I ordered this movie before seeing it at the theaters or on dvd. I thought it was going to be a good movie because Jack Black is in it. Well I was wrong. I thought School of Rocky was just a little boring.
4,"Excellence is educational, and fun","OK this is exaggerated, medium-quality drama. But it's also sweet, non-violent, and has most of the right messages. And some good music too. In the genre of ""wronged adult apparent loser molds group of kids into a winning team"", School of Rock is actually exceptional for its emphasis on heart, self-expression, and excellence as their own rewards. A good movie to watch with your kids, and talk about regarding school. And a chance for parents of the 60s and 70s to get a bit nostalgic too."
4,Jack Black puts on a great performance!,Jack Black does a good job in School of Rock. He has a lot of talent on the guitar.The kids in the movie are really talented. They all contribute well to the band. The reason I gave this movie 4 stars s because at times Jack Black overdoes it. Overall this is a great buy and you will enjoy this movie.
5,To those about to rock....,"This is one great movie. I have never been a fan of Jack Black, but things may change because of this gem of a movie. It does not deserve it's pg-13 rating, it is a great movie that kids and adults will enjoy. The kids are adorable and Jack is a master in the School of Rock. If you are a teacher, had a teacher, were a kid you need to see this movie. The music is great the performances top notch. WOW!!!!!!!!!"
4,No surprises,"After much anticipation, I just saw this movie on DVD. My expectation were high because I really enjoyed Jack Black in his prior movies, however, those movies never did him any justice I feel. So when he finally got a lead role (in School of Rock), I was excited. Also, reading all the good reviews on Amazon.com fired up my expectations. However, I sadly have to say that I was a little disappointed.The movie had many funny moments, and Jack Black is just crazy. He really tries hard to make this movie work. But I felt something was missing in the movie to make it a sincere laugh out loud movie.It's a great family movie (if you have older kids), even though the kids cursed in some occasions, with a nice moral. I recommend this movie to everybody. It's a nice movie with a good cast - the kids a great, but I feel it never takes off to be a great movie. Go and see it if you just wanna have some immature fun."
2,50 PAIRS IN 15 YEARS,"I work in the woods and in construction and I shoot so eye protection is an issue. I've purchased and broken 50 pairs of these sunglasses during the last 15 years. They are comfortable, cheap and have saved my eyes from flying debris many times. What they are not is perfect. They make everything yellow look white and they make it hard to see a green light. They break VERY easily, the last pair I broke, fell apart when i tried to take them off. SNAP! They are made in China and no longer have a guarantee. All in all, I'm looking for another brand."
4,"Original film version significantly different from remake, but still good!","Having read Neville Shute's book, and seen the three hour miniseries (and really enjoyed both), I really wanted to see this original film version starring Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch. The screenplay is a trimmed down version of the story, eliminating the development of Jean's relationship with her barrister, and eliminating entirely her development in Australia.Still, I thought the actors and director did a nice job with capturing the conditions of the forced marches, and although tame by any modern standards, I did have a sense of the horror of Joe's capture and crucifixion for stealing a chicken (and hitting a Japanese soldier).If you were going to watch both of these films, I'd suggest you start with this version first, and then let thenewer versionwork its magic on you later."
2,Poor printing,"This edition is poorly printed. It appears to be a copy of a previous edition. The type is smeared and often tilted. The font is archaic, such that an interal s appears as an f."
4,first time using amazon,"since i have never bought anything from amazon i wasn't sure they had the best prices......so i kept waiting for the price of this bag to drop, but it didn't and i still got a great deal. The bag's last year's model (so what!) and i wanted a different color, but i love the bag....plenty of pockets....sectioned off for each club.....and the putter tube is a real nice touch.....for 79 dollars i'd quickly buy it again.........and amazon shipped it through the golf warehouse and it was here three days before scheduled....."
3,Basic,While it has a lot of info....I feel that the info in the back of the book should be in the front and vice versa. It was a little basic.
2,"the fastest way to get discouraged, naturally","This book was the first I purchased on the subject of fertility, and while it did provide me with information, it also discouraged my hopes of getting pregnant. I came away from the book with the idea that both aspiring parents must be in superb physical condition in order to become pregnant; and if the woman is over 35 the chances are between slim and none. After reading other books and talking to other over-35 women (none of whom were in 'peak' condition) I got a more encouraging view of the situation. Armed with a different perspective I did spend some time rereading sections of Dr. Williams' book and found it less disheatening. This book might be best for someone who has already done some research on fertilty; I would not recommend it as the first read on the subject."
4,Great place to start!,"I found this book a very helpful introduction to the world of pre-pregnancy. We have not yet started ""trying"". I'm just over 30 and wanted a resource to find out as much as I could about what I should be doing now, in the month or so before stopping birth control, to be an informed and healthy pregnant-person-to-be! This book is a perfect place to start. Careful though - it's easy to get discouraged when reading about all the possible reasons you WON'T get pregnant, especially if you're over 30 and sensitive to that fact."
5,Great Toast,"the Big guy does a great job. Nice havng everyone's toast at the same time,exactly how you want it."
5,The world in a wildflower...,Emerson knew... Audubon knew... Steichen knew... Jack Sanders knows... an exhaustive yet never exhausting catalogue of the world beneath our feet... that which we ignore... yet which means so much... Jack Sanders... Carl Sandburg... a poet of nature... The Big Eye appreciates the ones who notice...
3,A bit basic,This book is OK but doesn't go into the level of detail needed for most people wanting to further their knowledge on all things scuba. I think it would be good for a completely new diver who knew very little about scuba diving and wanted any easy to read introduction. Divers who are already familiar with Scuba diving will not be as well rewarded
1,**UNAVAILABLE**,I am not specifically rating this book however I would like to note that I placed the order for it on May 12th and it wasn't until June 6th that I recieved an e-mail from Amazon stating the manual was unavailable. I just wanted to let everyone know that purchase for this book should be done elsewhere. Any and all items should be removed from the site if they are unavailable so that consumers don't waste time waiting and can purchase elsewhere. I have ordered the Complete Diving Manual via another site and again anxiously await its arrival based on the reviews of the book.
4,Cultural Misplacement and the film of Ann Hui,"From the director of <I>Boat People<i> and <I>Song of Exile<i> (who just won the Hong Kong Academy Award in 2000), this film definitely shows the serious (but interesting) side of Hong Kong's independent filmmaking. The film examines the cultural differences between East and West by focusing on a grandfather who looks after his 12-yr-old American Grandson. Very insightful and humorously done! Ann Hui herself, a director who separated from her family in mainland China and struggled to establish her career in Hong Kong, understands cultural differences. I would not say that this film is Ann Hui's best, but her better ones are not yet availiable in North America."
5,Pure evil black metal,"The most grim, kvlt black metal album Immortal ever did. Besides Pure Holocaust I would say this is one of the Greatest Immortal albums of all time. For fans of early Emperor (Wrath of the Tyrant), early Gorgoroth and Satyricon (Dark Medeival Times) Personally I really love this album but most people will say they prefer Sons of Northern Darkness. That album is really amazing but its not a evil and black metal as this album. Very raw sound, simplistic playing and Abbath sounds a bit different on this album then he did after it on Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North. Easily a 5 star album. Classic Immortal. True Kvlt Black Metal."
1,Discographie Sofronitzky-Scriabine,je desire connaitre le detail de tous les CDs disponible de Vladimir Sofronitsky pour ses enregistrements d'Alexandre Scriabine ainsi que de Claude Debussy et de Franz Liszt Merci d'avance Cordialement Gilbert Bouvier
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY A MOVIE!IT'S GARBAGE!,"I ONLY SAW 25 MINUTES OF IT-THEN THROUGH IT OUT!IT WAS BORING,AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO IT.A BUNCH OF NOTHING.JUST WALKING AROUND SEEING DIFFERENT THINGS.NOTHING OF INTEREST.JONATHON INTRODUCES HIS FRIENDS.LINDA TEACHES SCHOOL.AS SOON AS THEY PLEDGE THE FLAG-THE STUDENTS PUT A MASK ON.LINDA DOESN'T.A GIRL GETS MAD AT HER-THEN BITES LINDA.JONATHON SEES THESE PEOPLE GOING TO THIS HOUSE WHERE BRYAN WAS GOING.BRYAN'S PREACHING.THE GROUP LEAVES.SOMEBODY BROKE INTO LINDAS HOUSE.LINDA SEEMS TO BE NUTS.SHE ATTACKS JONATHON AND THE OTHER FRIEND SHOOTS HER.I FAST FORWARDED IT-AND THEN A MENTAL HOSPITAL IS SHOWN FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE.THAT'S IT."
5,One of the top 10 foods out there!,"Forget the TV advertised foods (purina, etc) as they are full of grains and wheat. Switch to this, specially if your dog is a small breed and overweight. Our 7 yr old Jack Russel was looking portly; we switched to this brand and within 4 weeks he had a waist and muscles, and more energy!"
2,This book is not worth your time or money.,"The author apparently believes that she can write an interesting book simply by having the protagonist say the word ""pussy"" every other page and have sex at least once a day with whoever is around. Despite the attempt to hold my attention with sex, the book is boring and appalling. In short, don't waste your time"
4,All you need,"I was looking for the best inexpensive cooler for an AMD 64 X2 that I salvaged from an HP 3100 Slimline which had blown its third motherboard in one year! (stay away from that model!) Anyway, the proprietary CPU cooler did not fit the new case/motherboard so I needed something new. I was very happy to find the TR2-R1 AMD CPU cooler; it looks solid and of very high quality and very inexpensive; it's also very quiet, compact and keeps the 'puter @ 35C which is great for a Micro ATX with onboard video. The only change I made was I replaced the thermal paste on the heatsink with Artic Silver 5 Thermal Compound. My client has been very happy; I would recommend this cooler to anyone except extreme over-clockers."
2,Disapointed,"Two stars because when it works it works wekk, problem is it doesn't work very long.I bought this TR2-R1 for an HP Pavilion hM7580N desktop in which the cpu fan had been intermittently vibrating enough to feel. The tr2.R1 was not too hard to install and cut my cpu temp by about 10 degrees. But on about the 3rd reboot I got a cpu fan failed shutdown from the bios. I reseated the MB connector and everything worked but the next reboot I again got the cpu fan failed and the fan was not spinning. Now to fight the return wars!"
2,Nice when it works right,Seems like a decent fan but I had a bad experience. The fan would not spin on start up. I have to spin it with my finger first and then it keeps going but its acting like it dont got enough to kick over. I even tried taking the fan off the heatsink and rotating it around but it made no difference. Guess I will just go down to local pc spot and get a new one.
5,Quit and cool,This product installed quickly and keeps my system very cool with almost no noise. Make sure to clean your CPU if you are replacing an old fan. This is very quit and really good. I would highly recommend this fan.
3,"Cooler is cheap, and it shows","Well, I bought this to replace the stock cooler and it does work better and quieter than the stock cooler. However, I am sure it would work a lot better if they had done a better job of smoothing the working surface. I mean, it is really rough, the stock cooler was much smoother and it was not smooth. I thought about lapping it but don't really have the time or the tools. Besides, I found that the biggest noise source in my system is the power supply, not the CPU fan."
4,Does not accomodate thick car keys...,"This item is very well made and, as others have said, the key clip rings seem strong. However, if you plan to put an extra-thick car key (like so many newer vehicles have today), don't bother. My Honda Pilot key (about 3/8"" thick) makes the case hard to snap shut and sticks out the bottom of the case about an inch or so. Because of the thickness you can't put it directly on the clip ring but have to use an intermediary ring. Except for this, all my other keys that I use regularly fit well in the case. I should have considered the Anello zippered key case, also made by Dionigi."
1,Stupid White Man Writing Stupid Book,This was not the author's best work and I found it rather tiresome - enough! Turn on CNN or CBS instead if you want rantings of this nature.
2,Not sure what to think...,"I was excited to read this book after all of the hype surrounding it. Unfortunately, it seems that the author spends a couple hundred pages ranting and raving but doesn't really give us any options to solve the problem. And he is very ""mean"" in his presentation. The information is good and helpful, it is just hard to ""wade through"" all of the outragous mud slinging."
1,Michael's Gibblets!,"They shake when he talks like a scared little turkey!!!!he needs cranberry sauce!I'm a liberal, but the dude is weird."
1,"I really, really, really tried to like this book","My small but lively book club chose this as our last selection. We thought it would make for some interesting discussion, especially after viewing ""Bowling For Columbine"". Instead, we could barely make it through Michael's incessant whining. Although at times you can see his feeble attempts at humor, you ask yourself constantly what's his point. He offers no solutions but has a great ability to rant like a manic-depressive off their meds.The kicker was his comments on Cynthia McKinney. At that point, he lost 100% of our respect. We decided it was time for a ceremonial book burning to rid ourselves of this inane writing.The worst thing is that we actually purchased the books and gave him $$ to continue pumping out this crap.Don't waste your time unless you have ample time to waste."
1,Moore Lies,"Lies, Lies, and Moore Lies by the Fat Trickster. Moore deceptions from the Left's Minister of Propoganda. Sheer fantasy. Skip it."
3,to Malcontent Colossus Of Rhodes Nurses.,"""Moore Has Yet To Be Laid Once In Life!!!!""You know that he has a daughter, right? The only way to have kids is to get laid. Kids don't appear like magic! Also he's married.Learn your facts before you write."
1,Not a funny book,"This is a great book of you are in the choir and like getting preached to.I'm sorry, but this book seemed rehashed and canned. It felt like I had heard everything before. I also find Moore to be an untrustworthy source, and question his claims. If you don't like Republicans read this for your own succor, but don't take him seriously."
4,One smart white man,"This book is mainly just one long rant by Moore, but I found it entertaining and insightful. Moore's wry sense of humor has never been better. However, I'm only giving it four stars because the whining does get a little annoying after a while. Nonetheless, Moore makes a strong case that the policies of the Bush and Cheney White House are, well, not too smart. ... Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
1,Wildly Overrated,"Remember that kid in high school that was full of angst, angry at the unfairness of the world and telling anybody who'd listen about how sucky his life was? Never really doing anything to make it better, but griping nonstop?Imagine that kid all grown up and, considered a spokesman for the disenfranchised (though he's now wealthy), still telling anyone who'll listen, spewing it onto a page and considering it literature, or, God forbid, ""advice"" on how to improve the state of the world.This book makes me ashamed to be a liberal. Save your money and subscribe to a newspaper, so you can get your facts straight, instead of the re-hashed, re-spun poser nonsense."
1,Awful,"This book is terrible, the author rags on Bush, yet makes no sound argument of how he would change things. If you want to read a book by a Democrat ... , buy it, it won't dissapoint."
1,I'm the Stupidest White Person!!!,"For reading this book that is! A complete waste of money. It was required for a class that I took and provided for some lively discussion. Fortunately for myself I was able to find it in a library and spared providing Michael Moore with any additional income.His endnotes are all but worthless! He documents little and places his own opinion in place of facts. While it's humorous it's sad to think that there are really people out there with the lack of individual thought that take this book seriously.If you mistake much of what's contained within this book for fact then you probably believe just about any conspiracy theory out there. Get over it! This is ""junk science"" at its finest. So before the government reads your thoughts it might be best if you covered your head with aluminum foil."
3,Left overs,"This book warms up the old morsels of heresy that are growing mold in every left winger's refrigerator. The world is a global village and Americans have made the village...their president. That is obvious. The book is unimaginative, politically correct, and the humor egotistical. Still, it might be a good gift to introduce reality to your ignorant cousin who thinks television news and the respectable print media contain anything besides misinformation for the oil and banking cannibals and their war machine. But is only an introduction to a small portion of what every reader of Counter-Punch, Z-Net and Indy Media already knows. Moore's analysis is not exactly cowardly, but it is conventional and timid. If you want insight from authors with the courage and acumen to challenge the Big Lies of the ruling elite, try Edward Hermann, Alexander Cockburn, Edward Said, Robert Fiske, Mazen Qumsiyeh, and Howard Zinn, instead."
4,"Excellent, especially with a grain of salt","It's unfortunate that people who don't agree with Michael have to slam him for the sake of hurting his ratings. I don't agree with much of what he has to say, especially in this book, but you must keep in mind that this is *entertainment*. He's very funny, in my opinion, but you have to realize that, just like any writer, his word is neither gospel or total lies. His opinions are rather skewed, but he brings quite a few scary facts to light in this book, regardless.Sit back, take a deep breath, enjoy the humor and listen to the message. I wouldn't want to live in a Michael Moore world, but we need men like him to do their best to keep the people on the opposite side of the fence honest (or at least as honest as possible). I think this book does just that."
5,YOu must this book!,"Michael mmor has taken courage to write this book, the essence of non-pc so he is thinking for himself. he is saying what should and needes to be said against this country. alternativ voice is what Jefferson and was all about."
1,Misguided!!!,What a waste of time and money! Doesn't he know they kill trees to print his garbage on!
5,Crazy but good,"Yes Moore is crazy but lets face it: he's funny, and he can cut to the heart of things. This is a great book, and well worth your time."
1,Written Just to Make Money,There is enough to criticize conservatives about without having to just make stuff up like Moore does in this book. He wants so badly to be clever he creates a fairly worthless writing. Too bad Moore can't write or present material as well as Coulter.
1,They're not limited to one end of the spectrum!,"That is...snotty, biased loudmouths aren't limited to one end of the political spectrum.Michael Moore may be less venomous than his conservative counterpart Ann Coulter; but, if anything, he's even *less* articulate. This book reads like an angry rant from a bad stand-up comic. Moore slings schoolyard insults, describing Republicans as ""stupid"" and Democrats as ""wimpy [and] spineless"" (p. 10), and rivals Coulter in the sloppy-research department..."
5,Funny and Thought Provoking!!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. MM uses plain language and humor to get right to the point. This books allows the reader to analyze our government, recent justice decisions and to take a real stand on the issues we deem important! Thumbs up to MM and I look forward to reading another of his books! Would definately recommend, but not if you're a REPUBLICAN (HA, HA)!!!"
1,Factually inaccurate and grossly distorted,"This book is an unmitigated piece of trash. I read more than half and then just skimmed the rest because I couldn't justify wasting the time to complete it. The book clearly is based in very poor research (footnotes indicate he has used very few if any primary, authoritative sources), and gross distortions and misapprehensions of fact. This book is an embarrassment to liberal causes since it is so obviously flawed in so many ways. Rather than promote points of view Moore undermines them with mindless ranting that adds no clarity or insightful analysis to the debate.Take this book with a bag of salt."
3,Al Franken he's not,"Even as a liberal who likes to trash Republicans for their open greed and disdain of the common man (when they're so more than common) I didn't think this book had much to offer. As a humorist, Micheal isn't that funny (certainly not an Al Franken) and as a political satirist, I would have liked more political fact than fiction. This book really seems to be about Michael Moore and does an adequate job of ripping up those who deserve it but it could have been so much better."
4,Stuied white men,"I thought this was a very good book. As a Scotsman married to an American, I would consider myself as very pro American. Though this does not mean that I am pro GW Bush's administartion. The chapter on the enviroment really impressed me. I think it echoes the genuine alarm, felt across the world regarding GW's enviromental(or lack of enviromental) policies."
1,Save your money!!,"Instead of calling this book ""Stupid White Men"", Michael Moore should have penned it as an autobiography and titled it ""Stupid White Man""..."
1,Close Minded Drivel,"Michael Moore has done it again. I don't know how people can buy this garbage. He is about as extreme a liberal as you can be on every topic and close-minded to boot.If you like reading one-sided innacurate drivel, buy this book. When I first saw the title and saw he was the author, I thought he finally wrote an autobiography (""Stupid White Men"")."
4,Mike & the Librarians Strike Back,"Mr. Moore has a way with simple declarative sentences. He uses them effectively. That talent seems to tick off the people who are the subject of his latest book.Why is the book #1 on the NYT best seller list after 4 weeks (this written April 22, 2002)?It is funny. It is profane. It is pedantic. It is not what we should be reading ""in wartime"".It is a quick read and it is a funny take on what we all ought to know by now.Consuming satire is the only way to live though the next few years without having a nervous breakdown - and it's cheaper than SSRI meds."
3,Interesting. but not all facts.......,"It is good to know that people around the country are reading this book and usually enjoying it. The viewpoints and facts of Moore are by all means anchored in liberalism, but the presentation is wonderful!If you want solid facts, avoid this book. This is not top notch journalism or 60 Minutes material. This book is sometimes sad look at the state of our nation in 2002. Regardless if you fall left or right, this book will at least give you perspective.One important thing to remember is this book will anger the right wing snobs and spark passion in the left wing wackos. Both groups need to understand that there is no liberal or conservative majority in America. If you read this book with that in mind, you will be entertained."
1,Spare yourself the agony,"I tried listening to the audio CD version of this book. Maybe Michael Moore's vitrolic rants are a good read but after just 2 hours I was sick of listening to it. Its just not funny, not interesting, and just plain irritating in the audio format."
1,Full of Baloney,Michael Moore is certainly off-beat with the majority of people in this country. Lucky he lives where he is free to share his views. I'll be sure to donate my copy to the local library so no one else has to waste their money purchasing it.
1,Misleading and Factless - Controversy for it's own sake.,"I read this book after a friend asured me it'd get me thinking and know the truth. The only problem is that there aren't any real facts and everything is a one-sided argument. Parts of the book are actually disturbing. The chapter ""Kill Whitey"" where basically he blames how horrible this country is (here I was thinking it was a pretty keen place) on white males. The bit about him firing all his white employees because they were white was pretty feeble. The gist of his book was all the world's ills are caused by republicans, jews and white guys...nice. I notice that he didn't mention that he lives in a 2mil dollar home in New York nor that he owns more than one luxury import.The truth is that Moore sold out after the success of Roger and Me and now he does anything he can to generate controversy and trick liberals into buying his tripe. I'd avoid this book and anything Mr Moore tries to hock in the future..."
2,"It's not worth the money, check it out at the library!","Dennis Miller meets George Carlin!! That about summed it up for me. Parts of it were wonderful, other parts like the beginning of chapter 4 were ridiculous!! I am not a conservative nor a liberal, and this is the first time I have read anything from Michael Moore, be assured it will be the last!"
2,Not worth reading,"So I finally got around to reading Stupid White Men. I was disappointed. I have enjoyed reading other left-leaning political satire, especially the works of Al Franken and Jim Hightower. However, this book wasn't funny, wasn't insightful, and was pretty stupid. The best part was the chapter on education, where Moore clearly states what is wrong with America's education system, and what needs to be done to improve it. At the beginning of the book he explains in vivid detail exactly how the 2000 Presidential Election was stolen. The rest isn't very good. In the chapter on the environment, I had hoped Moore would use scientific evidence in his arguments. I was disappointed. Don't expect to learn any science from Michael Moore.I think Michael Moore should stick with film. That's what he does best. I would recommend any documentary by Moore, especially Fahrenheit 9/11, and the book ""Adventures in a TV Nation"", over ""Stupid White Men""."
1,Thank goodness I didn't pay for this...,"My neighbor tossed this book into his recycle bin. I saw it sitting there so thought ""what the heck, free is free"". What I forgot was that I would nor could ever had the time it took to read this drivel refunded to me. Should I be conscious while I take my last breath of life I can guarantee that the thought that will cross my mind is how I could have had at least one more day of bliss had I not read Mr. Moore's garbage.However, not all is lost. At least the ignorant and maniacal left have something to keep them busy."
1,The best of the left....distorted facts and half-truths!,This book is a big waste time. Full of distorted points of view that can only being appreciated by a new york times reading socialist. If this is the best modern day book that the left can call their own...it looks like they have hit rock bottom!
2,Stupid for sure,Thank God for free speach! Only in America could a clown like Moore have a book like this published. Not part of the solution Mr. Moore continues to degrade the fabric of this country with his silly little book of fiction. Good for a fast read when you have nothing better to do than stare at the vacuum tube. I see why GM moved out of Flint. Michael Moore is the Stupid White Man.
1,AWFUL AWFUL READ,"Michael Moore sounds like an angry man pointing fingers at everyone and encouraging people to blame others for their problems. I started reading this book with an open mind, hoping to learn something from him. But the more pages I read, the more I feel alienated by the author. He is constantly angry, blaming and blaming and blaming other people for today's problems. He sounds like that girl who sued McDonalds for making her physically fat. ... I do not recommend this book at all."
4,"The ultimate rant, you'll enjoy it.","This book reads like one non stop rant. Its funny, charming and packed with a lot of good information. At times Moore seems too one sided and that might turn off a lot of conservatives but at the same time he raises a lot of great points about social and environmental issues that everyone should be aware off."
2,There's Plenty of Stupidity To Go Around,"Washington D.C. is chock-full of stupid people, Democrat and Republican, but Moore plays to the ""D"" crowd in this failed attempt at political satire and humor. P.J. O'Rourke's ""Parliament of Whores"", published over a decade ago, is far more instructive and entertaining.The problem with Moore is that he stretches reality a bit too far, and thereby kills the most effective element of satire -- its underlying truth."
1,Standard Fare,"There are no surprises in this book. It is standard fare for those who live in the make-believe world of the bonafide liberal democrat. In typical liberal fashion, the so called ""intellectual elite"" characterize anyone who doesn't share their particular set of biases and prejudices as stupid and unsohphisticated. Readers with the same bent will probably enjoy the book. Those in pursuit of a serious discussion of the issues facing America today would be well advised to look elsewhere."
2,GEEZZZZ Relax Man,"This book is nothing more than a rant. However I do give Michael Moore Credit due to the fact that he isn't one of those people who you run into everyday who just rants and complains about everything and does nothing about it. Michael Moore has always spoken his mind by means of writing and movies hoping to make a difference. His views seem to be a bit to socialist for my tastes and they become quite apparent in this book. Probably the only thing I did like was the beating on Bush even though it tends to go on and on, I agree with a lot of it. Even though I voted for Bush. Overall I can't say that I quite got the point of this book which attemts to be funny but really isn't."
5,Thank You Michael!,Finally a book written for the rest of us about the 2000 Presidential Election and other affairs. Michael is a great author who uses humor and common sense to make light of how messed up this country is. Michael doesn't hate America and for all who say he does needs to read this book. It's about time someone stood up to our government and showed us their B.S.
3,No less accurate than his right wing counterparts,"Summary: Michael Moore gives his take on the world, targeting the predictable standbys of the 2000 presidential election ,the war against terrorism, and the military. He also shares personal anecdotes, including a personal look inside the Nader campaign.The Good and the Bad: Some of the arguments seemed strident, and even slanted, which is becoming a common criticism of Moore. On the other hand, the rip on the presidential election really got my dander up.What I learned: The 2000 election was unequivocally stolen. Moore had a good idea to use the power of the Nader campaign to modify the Bush campaign, but the Nader people wouldn't go for it. At some point a propagandist sounds like a propagandist, even if he is shilling for the left."
1,One big liberal LIE,"This bright mix of propaganda, baled-faced lie, and false emotions should work strong on under educated audience like the author itself. Some more community college would be helpful."
4,Pretty good,its worth a read for the price. he makes some good points and i think that it was interesting.the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it is too gloomy and it leaves you MAD MAD MAD about the Bush administration.overall though it was pretty funny and the facts are suprising
5,Excellent,"Part of the fun of Michael Moore's work is that even when you disagree with him, he makes an extremely strong argument that is difficult to refute. Perhaps this is why he makes conservatives so angry. But this is healthy, if he makes conservatives angry, he is clearly accomplishing his goal.Moore's style is to pull no punches, this is a refreshing counterbalance to the PC reporting that we are deluged with in the mass media. Whether you agree with Moore that Bush stole the election of 2000 or not, it is interesting to read so as to understand the reason that such a large percentage of Americans are outraged by what took place. While I had mixed feelings about ""Downsize This"", I can highly recommend Stupid White Men."
1,Perfect title for a STUPID WHITE MAN!,"Somebody must have dropped Michael Moore on his head when he was a child. Something has to be behind the babble and ignorance that this STUPID WHITE MAN dishes out. THANK GOD I DIDN""T BUY THIS BOOK!! I borrowed the book from a friend, a fellow democrat, who agrees that the book is drabble! Yes, I am a Democrat. SURPRISE! This book is not worth purchasing from a garage sale 50 cent book bin!"
2,Well intentioned but not informative,"This book is probably not worth reading, other than as a primer for those who are interested in the problems relating to Corporatism, but know very little. The first chapter (talking about the 2000 election), is decent, as is the end. Everything in between is pretty much a bad attempt at humor, and is not very funny and definitely not informative. I'd skip it if I were you and read something a little more educational by Nader or Chomsky."
1,Another ...,"Its no surpirse that Micheal Moore used his Oscar time to preach politics and promote his book, ... Moore, a man who obviously relishes a position as being a liberal arm chair general ... offers what others have been saying for months -- only with Moore, he thinks that his fantasies (no, only a handfull of people boo'ed me at the Oscars) are somehow orginal. But what can one expect when such tall tales and urban legend are spun out by the same man who looked in the mirror one day and said eureka, ''I have a title for my crumy little book.''"
5,Chucklicious Political Read,"Are you sick of Republican lies?Are you tired of those Democrats lacking a back bone?Annoyed by those weird, high strung Liberals?Answered yes to one or all questions?I know I have.Then this funny, but painfully true book is the way to go. It may turn you into an activist (what type of activist is up to you), as it has done to me. At the very least, it will get you to vote and pay attention to community and county issues.Republican, Democrat, or Liberal; if you agree or disagree with him, it doesn't matter because; if anything else, he will make you think about the issues, politics, and questions concerning our nation. And THAT'S the point.Thinking about and discussing the issues that concern our great country is something I'm sure you haven't done in ages.Shame on you."
1,Screed - Could Not Finish,I could not finish this book. It was just too over the top anti-Bush. I am not a Bush fan and I loved Bowling for Columbine so I thought the book might be entertaining. But it was just a screed. One note played over and over.
3,"Entertaining read, but loose.","I enjoyed this book, it is certainly funny and says many things I agree with, but this was only for a few chapters. The rest is all over the place topic-wise. Moore writes about his personal peeves, as is his wont, but 60% of this book is probably more interesting to him than it is too others. I recommend it only for the single chapter that deals with the book title."
2,Ha Ha Huh?,"The truth is that this book is NOT very funny. It misses much more often than it hits in trying to pull a chuckle out of the reader. Mr. Moore seems to have moved so far inside his own little world that he apparently doesn't realize that his work is getting to the point where it is only ""clever"" to (or even worthy of the serious attention of) the most extreme conspiratists and businessophobes in our society. Whether you think he's a moron or a genius, he used to be amusing. This book is just tired, cliched, and kind of loopy in a way that is more pitiful than humorous."
4,STAR WARS - EPISODE ONE,"Episode one did not have as interesting a storyline as episodes 4, 5 & 6. Impact of the movie was lessened viewing it on a small screen."
1,I'm reviewing the Full Screen DVD not the movie,"DON'T YOU FULL SCREEN BUYING PUBLIC KNOW THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE SCREEN HAVE BEEN CHOPPED IN ORDER TO FIT YOUR TV SCREEN? YOU'RE LITERALLY MISSING HALF THE MOVIE, SOMETIMES YOU'LL HEAR A CHARACTER TALKING THAT SHOULD BE IN FRAME AND AREN'T BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN CUT OUT TO FIT YOUR SCREEN. WITH A MOVIE LIKE ""STAR WARS""(ANY ONE OF THEM)THATS GOT TONS OF COOL SPECIAL EFFECTS; DON'T YOU FEEL CHEATED? IT ALWAYS GETS ME WHEN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY WHINING BECASUE SOMETHINGS NOT AVAILABLE ON PAN & SCAN, BUDDY THEY'RE DOING YOU A FAVOR. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE ALL YOU FULL SCREEN BUYERS WERE AWARE OF THAT, THAT'S ALL."
3,A good movie on VHS = 3 stars,"Like the movie or not, I was very disappointed with a VHS copy. Even though I only paid $5.00 for it, the scratchy soundtrack and grainy video is exactly why VHS needs to be retired.Instead of taking the initiative Mr. Lucas continues to milk a dying format for more money. I am saddened that Mr. Lucas chooses to showcase his work in this manner and I can only hope that the DVD's will be seen sometime in the next few years."
1,Lucas should sue himself for licencing this flick...,"I saw it in theatres and it made me laugh... not a good laugh either. Jar-Jar Binks is the worst screen character, digital or otherwise, to have ever been created. Stan Winston's gnome in ""A Gnome Named Gnorm"" is the only character that I have ever seen that comes close to Jar-Jar in annoyance. The kid (Annakin) can't act, and Lucas can't direct. Visuals are good, but overrated. Good actors (Portman, McGregor, and Neeson) flounder under Lucas' direction. The story is great on paper."
3,Three stars,"I almost didn't write this review. Unlike so many others, I have not seen the original trilogy. While I cannot hope to know the significance of this film as a part of the entire phenomenon, it does give me the advantage of being able to look at it unbiased light. I can well understand why many loyal fans of the trilogy were disappointed. This film desperately needed a Harrison Ford. It lacked the emotion and charisma he brings to all his roles. And whether or not you consider the character of Jar Jar Binks to be racially offensive, you have to admit he was so annoying that it was a relief when he finally shut up. I gave the film three stars purely for the special effects and the fight sequence between Darth Mol and Ewan McGregor. If you're a fan of the trilogy, then this film is a necessity to your collection. I, however, felt that the story line was rather weak. And aside from Darth Mol, none of the other characters are particularly interesting."
4,Deleted Scenes Still Deleted...,"Everyone talks about how the deleted scenes are so wonderful, the problem, they remain deleted. Usually there's a cut and paste option, as with the new Die Hard releases. You won't find that here. Perhaps in the next release it will be. As for the story line.... Lucas is brilliant. Sure it was a little kiddish, but they will age with the film just like the rest of us did with the origional trilogy, think about it. A new hope looked like a one time shot, so he couldn't take the kid route. It's a trilogy, this was only Part I. My guess is that Part III will be pretty rockin, Part II will have to be better or Part III will never be made. The next films greatness will remain to be seen, but I can see where Lucas is headed."
1,c'mon george lucas,"this is just another ploy by george lucas to make money off of a failed movie, don't get me wrong i love star wars, but i'm not the biggest fan of the new ones, ESPICALLY episode 1, the hype was so big for this movie and i believe that lucas defiantly failed to deliever. Now he's trying re-release this movie, what's new about it, widescreen format and a few new documentaries with the same footage used in other documentaries about the movie that you could probably see on cable tv.In my opinion just another attempt to make money, is this really worth another $20 dollars to you?"
2,Quizzicality,I remember the disbelief and awe I felt when I saw this in the theatre.That someone could make an absolutely stunning work of art like THX-1138...AND THEN MOVE ON TO MINDLESS DRIVEL.
2,Disappointing at best....,"Well, what a disappointment... Of course the movie, technically speaking, is marvellous. But there's no substance. Lucas transformed the ""series"" into a show for all the family, totally inofensive, almost ""Disney-like"".The boy-actor that plays Anakin was a bad, real bad choice. The poor boy simply can't act.Jar-Jar binks was a bad comic relief.And now we learn that Lucas even intended to put NSYNC in the sequence (ATTACK OF THE CLONES), due to a request from his daughter!!!!The series is now nothing more than just a merchandising enterprise, and Lucas really lost his touch for direction. I hope the new sequence is better than this one."
2,Just not a good movie,This movie is nothing like the original series. I loved the first three and I was so excited about Star Wars P.M. But it was a real let down. All Star Wars fans should watch this movie but I am pretty sure most will agree with me. It just is a huge dissapointment.
3,"Hard to understand,hard to say",I am completely confused after watching the film.I don't know what the director wants to show us.I feel the producers have some commercial purpose.They were telling us a middle-age story but had a modern appearance.
4,See Through You I Can...,"For those who thought this will be the worst episode of Star Wars, don't be so cynical. Although there is hardly any fighting and the characters are a little plain...ITS ONLY THE FIRST EPISODE! Why didn't Qui Gon Jin disappear? What will happen between the senators of Malistar(?), Alderan and Naboo? What happens to Anakins mum? Why is Yoda so important and wise? What happened to the orginal Sith Lords?Remember, THINGS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER!"
2,Only for kids,"I'll make this short -- Episode One is suitable for kids only. However, it's a pity kids today don't have a better film to bond to, like I did over 20 years ago."
1,What a rip off!!!,"Jar-Jar?A kid in a Star Fighter, flying through a station, killing the bad guys? Not even The Force can explain this. Arrrr!If I could, I would submit without giving it even 1 star. I'm sure it's not worth that much. 'nuff Said."
2,really bad...almost not watchable,george lucas says this will be a good movie after episode 3 comes out. but i can't see why.i've tried to like this movie but its so hard. its not good at all. its painful to watch. its too juevenile.its just dumb and jar jar is the worst character thought of in the movie universe. he actually makes Howard the Duck look respectable.
1,An Epic Racist Travesty!,"This movie is so horrendous, I could go on for hours! The lifeless cast must have gone to the Acting School for Wooden Indians, pretty sad when a completely digital character(Jar Jar Stinks)seems more alive and interesting, and the brain squishing script left me cringing in horror. There are too many CGI things flying around on the screen it became quite irritating, this is the quintessential blueprint film for people with ADD(crisis every 5 min) and is a nightmare for anyone with an IQ over 80. Lets not forget the racism; Mexicans, Blacks, Asians play all the shady/weird characters in the film. I'm white and I noticed this."
4,STAR WARS:EPISODE 1 WAS A GOOD MOVIE.,"This movie doesn't have the most action in thw world, but it is still a good movie. When I saw it the second time, I understood it more.The movie is a good start for the next movies of the series. I think the visual effects were great. I can tell a lot of imagination and creativity went into the scenary.Jar Jar wasn't that bad either.The actors were o.k.The light saber fight at the end was really hype. I like the movie overall. I just don't agree with the discrimination of people of different backrounds in the movie."
1,"No DVD, No Stars!","If I could give 0 stars, I would. That being said, I enjoyed the theatrical presentation of this film. While the story line had some slow/superficial spots, the sound, imaging, and cutting edge effects more than compensated. UNFORTUNATELY, Lucasfilms, in all their brilliant arrogance and stupidity, opted against DVD release. Bad move Georgy boy! Why should us common folk be made to suffer just because you're still miffed at the fact that you would not support a technology that proved successful even without your support? Come on, put your pride on the shelf, along with some DVD star wars triolgies/ prequels/ Indiana Jones flicks/ etc...."
3,"Great special effects, dull human characters","This movie has great special effects, but the human characters are dull. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, but in this movie, he appears listless and bored. Ewan McGregor, who plays Obi-Wan, has some potential, but his lines in this movie were too simplistic and banal. Natalie Portman was about as animated as a stone monument, and her costumes and makeup were really bizarre. It made Carrie Fisher's hairdo in Episode 4 look stylish. Darth Maul was an interesting character, but his face makeup and horns were silly looking. It reminded me of a WWF wrestler. I found Jar Jar Binks to be an annoying pest. Jake Lloyd's character was too young for me to believe he could accomplish everything he did in this movie. Let's hope George Lucas learns from his mistakes in Phantom Menace, and makes a more serious, mature film in Episode 2."
4,What is old is new again.,"George Lucas had a tough row to hoe: He had already created the most successful movie series of all time, but after a nearly 20 year gap was expected to take up where he left off and meet everyone's anticipations and expectations. Well, he met mine! I was very pleased with this movie! I especially liked the way the design of the movie implied that the republic was at one time the pinnacle of galactic achievement; the architecture, spacecraft, fashion, etc. The later years (witnessed in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) show decay and the breakdown of the organized consumer base. This was reminiscient of the ""Foundation"" trilogy by Isaac Asimov to me. I give it a thumbs up! WAY up!"
3,George Needs Our Money!,"I guess what chaps me the most about this video is the price. I didn't need a book and some lame slide--I just wanted the movie. It was simply a way to justify charging almost double for a widescreen version. I guess when Lucas decides to release it on DVD we can all buy it again! I already have two box sets of the trilogy. God, I feel like an idiot. Thanks George!"
4,"Lucas, get your head into DVD","A very good film, perhaps the saga has gone on for too long though. And forget all these boxed VHS sets, when are they planning on releasing it on DVD! .Apart from that though, buy it,.. all your friends will want to watch it. Exciting."
5,Excellent addition to the Star Wars saga,"Regardless of what some might say, this movie is one of thebest Star Wars ever, and is definetly worthly of being part of thesaga. The computer animation was absolutly mind boggling. As I watched the movie I kept thinking, how did they do all of this. The Podrace scene inparticular, is just awesome. I could watch that a hundred times and still not get bored of it. The combination of live actors and computer generated characters was seemless, and to think, the next one will look even better. END"
1,A complete waste of time..,"If I could've given it a zero I would've.. I loved the first 3 Star Wars flicks but this one has none of the suspense, charm and fun of the others. I wish they would've spent more time developing the storyline and characters rather than the special effects. Sometimes more is just more, not better..That's the problem with hollywood these days, they feel that they have push the envelope with explosions, chase scenes and graphics in order to keep us interested and to spend our hard earned money at the theaters. Then again, like everything else, it's supply and demand.... Maybe it says more about society today."
4,Not everyone has a DVD player.,"People seem to either love or hate the movie; see the reviews below. Yes, for numerous reasons, Lucas is downright greedy (i.e. multiple film versions and releases, no standard widescreen tape for sale in North America). Lucas needs to cut back on the toy/product endorsements; he is only contributing to society's problem of materialism.That being said: I'm sorry to hear so many people whine about DVD. It's great that you have the latest technology, but many people only have VHS players, if that. I enjoyed the widescreen version of the movie, and life goes on.Listen to the news.... hear whats happening in South Africa and your DVD problem is no longer such a big issue. If it is, just be patient and wait a few years until the DVD release. Of course, by then there will be newer and ""better"" technologies......"
3,Effects Alone Do Not Make A Great Movie,"Despite Jar-Jar and the kid from ""Jingle All The Way"" (yeah, he couldn't act in that one, either), ""The Phantom Menace"" is a pretty decent movie. In no way does it compare to ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but it does hold its own in the Star Wars mythology. And with episodes two and three quickly approaching, ""Phantom"" will surely find its niche.Besides, after watching it over again, ""The Phantom Menace"" began to grow on me. Maybe it's the podracer sequence or the lightsaber clashes with Ray Park's (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""X-Men"") Darth Maul. Or maybe ol' George is just putting something in the water; I don't know. All I know is that ""Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace,"" once you get used to it, is pretty darn cool."
3,Great scenes and effects,"I liked the first trilogy, I thought it was pretty good, but this movie didn't seem to be in the same catagory. The plot was kinda boring, and the acting was ok, the only thing that was great is the effects, and the light saber fights. I always like watching those. It didn't seem like a Star Wars movie, it was missing a whole lot of stuff. Don't get it I would say, unless you collect Star Wars movies or something. Not a recommendation."
2,garbage,"episodes 4-6 are in fact some of the most outstanding movies I have ever seen....but this one, is just [bad], i really didnt like it at all, I can't believe I saw it in the theatre. The only cool guy Darth Maul has like two lines, but on the plus side the computer animation is top notch, other than that you'd have to be an ultimate star wars nut to like this."
4,episode I : The Phantom Menace,"I think people are being way too hard on this film. The main reason people don'tlike it is because they were expecting Lucas to just remake the original trilogy. What people do not understand is that this is an entirely differnt galaxy that we are in. The entire galaxy has been changed as e enter episode IV. People don't understand that it's a differnt age.The only thing wrong with this movie is the Gungans, and that is a very minor annoyance."
2,Lucas must have needed money,"This movie was terrible. It has no right to have ""Star Wars"" anywhere in the title. Bad writing, bad characters and a bad move by Lucas to put out this sesame-street-meets-FlashGordon garbage."
4,Definitely worth the money...,"Despite constant media criticism, and the annoying Jar Jar Binks, this is a solid movie. Keep in mind as you watch that it is only the beginning, and will seem far more complete when the prequels trilogy is finished. If for nothing else, buy it for the lightsaber battles alone!"
1,SENT WRONG DVD!,"I ordered Star Wars Episode I and, although the case was correct, the dvd was totally wrong! It was a CHEAP dvd that you typically see free in some magazines. As angry as i was i was too unmotivated to do anything about it because it was only 6 bucks."
2,Talk about a big TOY COMERCIAL,"Yep...to me, all this movie was was a big toy commercial. It was totally directed to the way younger audience that could still laugh at characters like Jar Jar. The fx were amazing but the movie itself stunk. Infact, the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars is because of the special effects. I'm sure many star wars fans have clouded their minds to think that this was a great movie so that all that waiting and money spending didn't go to waste. I planned on seeing it like 20 times before I actually saw it...after I saw it...I'm glad I didn't do that."
5,outstanding!,"i just read that the dvd edition of this movie is sceduled to be released october 16,2001 in a 2 disc special edition....and the rest of the films are to be done in a 2 disc editon also and released one per year until they are all out....i don't know how firm this announcement is,but i hope that it's true!"
1,Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace,Don't get the 'regular' cropped screen version. Other reviews you may have read warn of this tragic viewing experience. Only the wide-screen version will do. I was very upset at the cropped version which I viewed the other night. Don't waist your time.
3,"""I'll stick to the classics""","Thank you Mr. Lucas. I think most of us have been wondering, what ever happened before A New Hope? I think we can all agree that Star Wars is one of the best movies ever made. The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie but the classic originals are better. Attack of the Clones is better but still doesn't compare to the oringals. This is the beginning. This is what we've been waiting for. The explanation of it all. Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. Darth Vader) is just a young boy and is taught by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) to follow the Jedi ways. You have to watch this movie though. Watch for Episode III to hit theaters in May of 2005."
3,NEAT EFFECTS! Choppy-weak story. Still Worth It.,"If you are familiar with the first 3, this one lacks a compelling story, and fails to maintain any suspense. [We already know what will happen with most of the characters--we've already been told the ending in the 1st 3 films. None of the rest of the Star Wars series yet to be made will be able to maintain much suspense either, for the same reason.]Still, as an exercise in Star Wars stuff, it is moderately entertaining, and the special effects are really neat. Chaulk one up for ever improving computer technology. However, the effects may lose something in the translation to the smaller TV screen. The letterbox edition should be better than the cropped version."
3,This Movie Was Ruined By...,"The brat who plays Anakin (or Annie) and the demented ""Jar-Jar Binks"".If it weren't for those two,this movie would be a lot better.But there are still one problem with this movie.-Why did the Trade Federation take over Naboo? Is it for power...or glory...or what? The movie never explains why.See,I would have given this movie five stars if it weren't for that little **** Anakin,and the kiddish Jar-Jar Binks.Luckily,Jar-Jar will die in Episode III.Star Wars fans,rejoice!"
4,A stage setting epic,"Many people have criticized this film. While i agree, the childish humor of jar-jar is tiresome and annoying, it captures a more simple, open feeling which is reflective of the young Skywalker. This film sets the stage for the upcoming tragedy that the other films part of. Peace is coming to an end, innocence has no place in the story being created by Lucas's vision. The parallels between Luke and his father are so easy to see in this film. My only dissapointment in this film (aside from jar-jar) was the Jedi council. It seemed a bit too oppressive and narrow minded... not that i would have any idea what such a society would be like. In all, i liked this film. By the third time i watched it, i was able to tune out Binks and focus on the story of the Jedi and Skywalker."
3,I doubt I will buy this,"While I did love the first three Star Wars, this version was not up to par.... I hated Jar-Jar Creap and the wasted storyline they had with the young Darth Vader could have been better.... I don't think they should have made him so young, it would have been better if he was in his early teens, where you can say, yeah I see why he went to the Dark Force... Instead we have a boring race to save the day. YARN!!!!But their is light at the end of this narrow tunnel... The other characters were way better.. Queen Amidala played by Natalie Portman was a freshing change in the story.Darth Maul was, well; what can I say EVIL.For the life of me I don't know why they waited 2 years before they put out the DVD I thought that was pretty stupid. Even if I really like this movie, and I had to have it I would never buy the VHS version, No way.Hopefully when the other two comes out they will release the DVD as well as the VHS."
1,Worst movie of 1999!,"The most anticipated movie of the year or should I say the past twenty years, was nothing more than a spectacle of computer imagery (even though the Matrix got the Oscar for special effects). Jar Jar Binks was nothing more than an annoying stereotype. I couldn't stand the fact that they made Anakin Skywalker a ""Christ-like"" figure, and the fact that they called him Annie was just outright appolling. And the fact that the Force isn't a spiritual enlightment, but rather micro-organisms swimming in the bloodstream makes it seem like you'd need a vaccine rather than see this movie."
2,A bland film gets what was ONCE a long awaited DVD...,"But now it means nothing to us. The movie wasn't great, and when it was first released, we were ticked for it not having a DVD release. Now that that 'phase' is over, a DVD is released. I know I don't want it anymore.The movie has already been played on TV. Why waste the money?"
4,Not the best- but still a great flick!,"Star Wars continues to break new ground, and what this film lacks in story and stupid characters- Jar Jar, it makes up for in Special effects and new ideas.I thought the light sabre scenes were fresh and interesting.The pod-racing was awesome, and the Jedi training area most interesting.The casting was on the whole pretty good, with Ewen MacGregor and Liam Neeson stealing the day.The extra scenes and stories that come with the DVD version are also very interesting and gives one more insight into the philosiphy behind behind the story.Still a great, if not brilliant movie, and will keep you entertained for a couple of hours!"
3,Not Bad,"not bad, special effects are good, held my interest. Not as good as the orginals (in storyline) seemed kind of strained trying to keep it interesting"
2,Great Jedi Battle.....,"If you like special effects and want to see THE best Jedi fight of all the Star Wars movies , then I recommend buying the movie.Otherwise, just wait until it comes out on HBO and they give it 50 times a week.It's not worth buying."
1,I can't believe this...,"I can't believe that the most eagerly awaited movie of all time is such a waste of your time, everyone thought that it was going to be almost a religious experience, something close to what the first three movies (ROTJ weakest but it had it's high points). This is the movie that had the potential to beat Titanic from the #1 position, this was going to be something historical, something to be remembered, but nope, Lucas probably gave his old ideas from the 70s to someone to write the script for him, he filmed it and later sent it to his team at ILM, and guess what something mutated with muppets movies, star wars and Roger Rabbit came out, dissapointed millions of fans and made little kids crazy for stupid characters."
5,A MUST HAVE MOVIE!,"This movie is one of those that you must own. There are more questions to be answered that may be answered in the next installment(s) of Starwars movies. Such as ""What happens to the Jedis'?"". This may be answered in one of the next two movies.I could go on for over my limit for this review but I will not do that.This is a great movie and one you should own."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"Seriously the best critique is on youtube - check out Redlettermedia 's 70 minute review - George Lucas is a hack, this movie is just a lame attempt to show how much CGI he could generate, and the hilarious part was he was outdone by other that year. These movies were made to showcase ILM and make money from merchandise - the story was probably cooked up two days before filming with triple space action to make it look better."
1,Star Wars a new failure..,Worst star wars movie in lucasfilms history. This movie sucked. I suggest episdoe 3-6 those are the only ones really worth seeing....
1,bad movie,"this movie is a joke, george lucas is couting up the $$ he's making off of this new trilogy trash and he doesn't even have to bother coming up with a good script. he just uses a bunch of special effects and slaps the star wars name on it and probably laughs at all the people who shell out their money to see it."
1,Jar Jar must DIE!!!!,"I realize that this isn't exactly original but I need to cleanse myself of the built up JJ angst that is welling inside me. This film promised so much and delivered so little in large part because moviegoers were forced to endure that nauseatingly brutal creature and it's infuriatingly annoying voice. There is no way in hell anyone with a light saber and the ability to use it wouldn't have decapitated that annoying piece of dung within ten minutes of meeting ""it"". In the end this movie goes down as one of the biggest disappointments ever, boring, pointless and worst of all ANNOYING, you couldn't pay me to sit through another viewing of that film, I'd cover myself in honey and dive in an anthill first. DON'T BUY IT."
1,Menace to Society,I spent 30 minutes with my PS2 controller watching Phantom Menace... I thought it was a game!Just kidding. This movie is horrible. Nuff said.
1,Let's face it...,"The movie was basically [bad]. Some nice visuals, Darth Maul was pretty cool, but it had SO MANY flaws in character development, credibility, and plot that it's essenially a very annoying movie with some good effects. It's not just a case of 'my expectations were so high and of course it couldn't live up to the blah blah...' This is just a BADLY written and directed film.The 1 star I do give it is for the making-of part of the DVD which was interesting."
2,Oh Brother,"What the heck was Lucas thinking when he decided to make this movie? (...) This is a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars movie. Lucas really should have quit while he was ahead. This movie has SO many problems. bad casting, bad acting by the child stars, horrible characters like Jar Jar and Darth Maul. Under developed plot AND an over developed plot (only Lucas could screw up on both counts) He tries to cram too much into this movie. I mean what are the chances that Darth Vader built C-3P0. He totally killed the magic of the force and annoyed the heck out of everyone by having the characters over explain everything. Ant the worse thing, The fact that Lucas used toilet humor in this movie. The only good to come of this movie is the soundtrack, the podrace, and the lightsabre fight. The rest of the movie is really lame"
1,oh dear,"a tip for the film industry when following up on a successful film or films try to remember what happened in previous films. george lucas ignores all that facts from empire eg ben was trained by yod,the force is a living energy field."
1,DVD Please,"Sorry, I won't buy it on VHS. I'm more than willing to wait until the DVD version comes out. George Lucas is just trying to milk everyone for more money buy getting them to buy the VHS now and then hopefully getting you to buy it on DVD later. No thanks! Say no to VHS!"
2,Stinker.,"This movie will never be good while the title Star Wars is attached to it. The characters were boring; Qui-Gon Jinn died before we could get to know him, Obi-Wan was bland and expressionless and Darth Maul? Come on, horns? Yeah, right. Plus, we get the stupendous Queen Amidala was just about as exciting as a stuffed frog. The only exciting person in the whole wretched flick was Anakin, but we know his fate so it's not too exciting. And where the heck was Han Solo's father? That would have been sweet.As for plot, it wasn't intriguing because they introduce you to the problem, think it out and solve it all in the same movie. The only thing that saves this movie from the dump is that it has decent special effects and it is part of the Star Wars saga. Just watch Episode 2, it's alot better.@lex"
2,"Re-release, re-release!","Please Mr. Lucas, please re-release this movie. Take into thought what the fans are saying. That's why Star Wars is as big, the fans. I've been a fan since the 80's and I collect Star Wars. I love the originals (ANH, ESB, ROTJ) and watched them regularly, I couldn't get sick of them. Then when I heard that there was going to be prequals, I was so excited. I can't believe that is the result. It's more of a joke to Star Wars than a part of the Star Wars Trilogy. Just cut some of the podrace, take out ""Wizards"" and ""Yipeee"" and Anakin's accidental blow up of the Droid Control Ship. The future Darth Vader couldn't do it on purpose. He's so strong with the force. And please take out Jar Jar's stupid antics and dumb jokes and sayings. ""Ex-squeeze me"" It would be a much better film and I think the fans would love it more. It would seem more like Star Wars."
5,Episode 1,"Matrix is not even a close second to this movie! Yes, the movie was geared towards children but that was good. The story was fast and fun and the plot was rich enough to enjoy as an adult and simple enough to enjoy as a child. The star wars trilogy was a hard act to follow and Lucas succeeded in in almost every way. The picture quality of the VHS version was blurry and drab but I suspect this is for reasons of the eventual release of a THX "" SPECIAL EDITION ""version in the future. That's it sell them the video two or three times not just once. I still think it's worth it even if the picture could be better."
1,Worst Star Wars Movie!,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, but this was the worst one!Pros:-Good Sound Effects-3-D Effects-Pod Racing! :)Cons:-EXTREMELY complicated, boring storyline-Repetative music (Your ears feel like they're gonna break!)-NO DARTH VADAR! :(-Anakin acts dumb!Overall: There are better Star Wars movies out there. Please skip this one!"
3,"Help, Lucus is out of Control !","Though the special effects and final 30 minutes of the film were fantastic. The storytelling, screenplay, characterizations, and editing seemed to comercial, un-interesting, and inept to telling the tale of the first Star Wars sequel. I do plan to buy the tape in order to have the entire set. The magic from the orginal three films is noticably absent from the extravagent proceedings. I for one waited in line 9 hours for Day 1 tickets and was momentously disappointed. The film did have the Star Wars heart just not nearly enough of it. Lucus, go find Irvin Kisinger NOW."
1,"If there was -5 stars, that's what I'd rate this movie...","Okay, it's kinda hard to rate this film. If it were written and made 20 years ago, the screenplay would have been better(considering nowadays people don't make movies as well). But now that it was made in our present day, the graphics are better. Either way the plot was way too weak, it was boring, the cast was bad, the screenplay was bad, and it wasn't interesting. For some REAL science-fiction movies, check out the Abyss, the ORIGINAL Star Wars movies, Aliens, or the Matrix. If you ABSOLUTELYMUST see this movie, I suggest renting it first.ñ"
2,The Old series is way Better,I personally don't like this movie. I like the old Star Wars much better. There are better special effects than these new ones. This movie should be setting the standards for graphics like the old ones did when they first came out. Again its my personal opinion.
4,Pure innocent entertainment!,This is a really entertaining film with great techinical effects and the visual feeling of the film is perfect. The dialouge could have been cooler but the actors look good in their roles and it's just an escape to another world for circa two hours. I recommend it as an entertainment but nothing more.
2,Jar Jar Must Die...,"The Star Wars series deserved better than this drivel. Perhaps Lucas shouldn't be allowed to run with this ball by himself.While most of the ILM computer graphics were impressive, the inane characters like Jar-Jar and the young Darth made the 4th movie nauseating. Not to mention that Jar-Jar is an offensive, thinly veiled Rasta step-n-fetch stereotype. And where did Lucas get off turning the FORCE into some internal parasites. He apparently was trying to turn this part of the Star Wars myth into some sort of Judeo-Christian chlorophyll. I don't need Hollywood to instill moral character through artifical religion based on viral infections. Bleeechhh!"
5,Awesome-To all you purests out there,"Its time people realize somthing important. When George Lucas sat down to write star wars in the early 1970's he wrote episodes 1-6. Not 4-6, 1-3 but ALL six!!! He couldn't make a movie that long. So he came up with the story from ep 4 because he felt it was the best part for the time. It was the greatest film of all time. He did not expect it to do that well. He was exhausted from working on it, and vowed never to direct again, which is why he did not direct ep 5 and ep 6. However, years went by, and so did the technology (which his company developed!! ILM) which became CG. Now that it existed, he could tell the story he wanted to tell- ep 1-3. BY KNOCKING THIS MOVIE YOU ARE KNOCKING LUCAS HIMSELF!! Its his baby. NOW PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, get over Jar-Jar!! I was frankly blown away by the lightsaber scenes in this movie. And the other characters-awesome. For those that think Jar-Jar was stupid what about C3PO and R2-D2 they were comic relief as well."
3,The Phantom Menace,"The Phantom Menace was ripped to shreds by the generation which waited 16 years for the Star Wars prequel. Fortunately, I am not in that generation. Devoted fans may have learned a lesson, not to expect too much from a middle-age writer who has made his fortune. The kid who plays Anakin has no personality. He exhibits no sign of being fated to become Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks is controversial. Some saw a racial stereotype. I saw a duckbill dinosaur crashing into Star Wars from Jurassic Park."
4,"Good movie, but....","I am a Star Wars fan and will always be a fan. I absolutely loved the first three films and had high expectations for the fourth, ""Phantom Menace"". It did'nt live up to all my expectations but it lived up to most of them. The character Jar Jar Binks was annoying at first but he kind of grew on me after a while. The actors were sort of wooden and stiff but even that became bearable. The 'star' of ""Phantom Menace"" was the incredibly beautiful special effects. George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic have created another special effects masterpiece. I hope the next installment of the 'prequel' will be better."
1,Bad Movie All Together,"Undoubtedly, this is the worst Star Wars movie of the four. It is pointless, silly and pretty much stupid. The plot is somewhat confusing and the characters speak English with such an accent, nobody understands them. Jar Jar was another bad idea. What moron at Lucasfilm's thought of him? He was completely designed for kids yet many fans are kids AS WELL AS Adults. Jar Jar had absolutely no point in the movie. He could have easily been drafted out of it. This movie all together was a bust. The only reason it wasn't a flop was because it carried the prestigious name STAR WARS. If George Lucas had brought this script to Fox Studios 22 years ago, they would have rejected him along with every other movie company in the world."
3,Waiting so long...barely worth it..still not enough!,"Pretty Good Video, but the audio can sure let you down at times, and the fact that we waited a while for this DVD, can't explain why Lucas couldn't of slapped on a DTS track in the first place. I rented this so I could get a dose of the special features and see some deleted scenes, and compare with the full screen video version with the DVD. It's good, and I like to see a wider shot of things.But someone, PLEASE KILL JAR JAR BINKS. He's the reason why this movie doesn't pass for me and why Star Wars Episode I was such a big disappointment. He also ruins the sound quality, and he hurts my eyes, so yeah, you can tell he is pretty annoying. But the DVD passes, not the movie. But the DVD is a disappointment as well, if Lucas made us wait so long, where is the better quality?"
4,Not the best of the series,"This film has a great cast, but suffers from a weak story. The origin of the Star Wars saga should have been a strong story. This film failed to entertain me in the way that I had expected it too. I like the whole idea about the invasion and war on Naboo. The origin of young Skywalker, and Paopatin were pretty interesting. I also liked the character, Darth Maul. The part of this movie that bored me to tears was the silly pod race on the desert planet. It was very unnecessary and boring. The rest of the story is okay though. It's possibly the weakest of the Star Wars movies, but it's a must see for any fan of the series."
2,The Worst,"The visual effects are outstanding. The duel at the end is spectacular. Now that the ""good"" is out of the way, the story is awful! It seems that Lucas tried to fit too much into this movie. Everything happened too fast as though the Jedi started in the morning and defeated Darth Maul by lunch. The characters were rediculous. You can't help but hope Jar-Jar gets shot in the head, or hope that you do. At least one of you has some relief! And the Vice-roy. These guys sound like Japanese being stereotyped with that ""bad english"" accent.The acting in this movie was pathetic. What was Lucas thinking when he cast Anakin? This kid CAN NOT act. Any kid could act as good as that. There are many child actors who would have done well in that movie. It wasn't just him, no one in this movie did a good job. This is definately a rental, don't buy it!"
2,A Sad Ending to a Long Wait,"I, like many others waited long and hard for Star Wars 1 to come out. I was extremely disappointed. In the first trilogy released, while there were three movies that were separate movies but tied together, Star Wars 1 just seemed like the first installment in a miniseries.The inclusion of Jar-Jar Binks as a main character was, at best, a travesty. He has neither the warmth of R2D2 or the bumbling antics of C3P0.I can only conclude that, should George Lucas insist upon making the rest of the trilogy in this vein, he'll lose more and more fans. And should he continue to make the last trilogy in the line, there'll be no one left to watch."
3,"A good effort, George. Must try harder.","This is a fact: The Phantom Menace is not as good as the first three Star Wars movies. Sorry, George. I watched the original trilogy mere days before viewing Episode I and the problem is clear. The old movies were based on humanity and close friendships, and the new one is all technical talk and machinery. Lucas has seriously misjudged the characters of Anakin and Jar Jar - skipping around exclaiming ""yippee!"" does not suggest a dark soul, and falling over a lot isn't funny. It's a pity Lucas didn't recognise the good stuff and throw out the bad when writing his screenplay because he has to realise the Star Wars movies ARE sensational, and to make a new one it MUST exceed them, or at least match them. Otherwise, what's the point?"
3,Good,"""~Here is the first chapter to a six film story. Now as beginnings go, it wasn't too bad. The story itself was involving and interesting over all. But some moments really detracted from the film. Specifically Jar-Jar. What his purpose is, I don't wanna know. But I could see where Lucas was coming from that he probably had his six year more in mind than us 30+ who saw the original as kids. something without fully understanding what they are writing about. It was an OK story that will continue on and if some people cannot reclaim some of that child like awe when viewing this, that's a shame."
1,0 out of 5,"I love Star Wars. I hate Phantom Menace, it is not Star Wars. The only thing that has anything to do with the original movies is the title. This movie is absolutely horrible in all aspects. I was in utter shock at what was done to a series that I love. Take the money you would spend on this and give it to charity or buy a homeless man a sandwich, you will feel better. This movie has nothing to offer and after watching this I have no interest whatsoever of watching Episode 2 or 3. Which is too bad cuz I love Star Wars, but this is not Star Wars. It's just a way to make money, and just because this movie made alot of money at the box office doesn't mean it's any good, the script decides that, and it's not wise to assume that everyone who paid to see it even liked it. That is just silly. It was hyped up alot and fans of the real Star Wars movies expected this to be as good as the others, sadly it is very much below par. Avoid this at all costs."
3,It's ok,"This was ok. I was expecting more for the actual beginning of the sequence. There was too much special effects, it ruined the prospect of the movie. There were some cool parts, but the storyline was weak. Attack of the Clones along with the original trilogy were MUCH better."
1,Shame on Mr Lucas!!!,I did enjoy the parts of the movie that had the Jedis but the whole thing about Jar-Jar ruined the whole movie for me. Lets hope that if he is in the 2nd movie that he DIES at the first so the movie can be good.
4,"Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)","The whole family really enjoyed this special effects thriller! Although we have the whole series now, this film could stand alone and be very enjoyable because they fill you in on any detail you may have missed from the other films, without seeming out of place, and they don't even have to do that very often."
4,Good,"I really llike Star Wars, and this movie was no exception, but why did there have to be so much Jar Jar?! Yeah, yeah, he was sort of revalant to the plot, but as one of my friends said, ""Less Jar Jar, more Maul!!!"" he has a point. There aren't a whole lot of lightsaber fights with the jedi in this episode. The pod racing and whatever duels there were in the movie were exciting, but it was a bit more talky than episodes II- VI. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent movie and has a place on your shelf, but episodes IV, V, and VI should be there too. (So should Episodes II and III they're really good)"
1,what a waste....,"I went to see this the first day, waited in line for an hour (like a good fan), and what did I get? Disappoinment. The kid who plays anakin is horrible, The Bad guys were 1 dimensional ( Does any one notice that darth maul doesn't even speak! ) The only part I enjoyed was the final fight scene. Lucus went a little too far with the power of the force. I hope the second one is MUCH better (sequels in trilogys are always the best...)"
3,Star Wars - episode 1,I saw Phantom Menace in the theater shortly after it came out and then saw it again on VHS. The second time around got no better. This movie could have been ten times better. The plot was a convoluted mess of political garbage. The storyline should have focused more on characters with the political scene happening in the background. That was the secret behing the first three movies. There was focus on the characters. ...Long live the force.
4,"Great content, terrible execution","Deffinitelly worth a buy, due to the content.Pros:* Deleted scenes documentary, which also tells you why scenes get deleted, and how they are chosen.* ""The making of..."" documentary offers rare insights into the financing of the movie.* Two scenes added into the movie.Cons:* It forces you to install a terrible DVD player, which tends to crash, does not install properly and drastically decreases the movie quality on under-1GHz computers."
1,Great DVD! Bad Movie.....,The picture and sound on the DVD are great....but the film is one big cartoon!
2,LESS is MORE,I'll only bother mentioning the special effects because that's all that people debate about. Everyone acknowledges that the plot stunk.The computer generated people just didn't look real. Maybe compared to computer games but anyone who has been outside and seen real things knows that something is wrong.What's wrong with using costumes like they did in the good Star War movies? I'd rather see a cantina full of costumes and Muppets than an arena full of cartoons.I'm optimistic that the next one will be better. PLEASE don't animate the wookiees.
2,A Historic piece of JUNK!,"Wow this movie was bad. It was boring, the script was lame, the acting was bad, and I did not even see the plot for I was too busy sleeping! I love star wars but this movie did not even have to come out. They released this movie for a smaller audiance but Im sure they did not like It because it was soooo boring! Episode 2 should have been the first one. The fact that Anikan is like 10 and Padme like 17 is a little creepy considering they marry in episode 2. Wow that was bad! Thank god for DVDs."
3,"Not George's best, but still good","A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, A New Hope was made, and was a hit. 2 years later, Empire Strikes Back bravely carried on the tradition. Return of the Jedi was another box-office smash. Everyone anxiously awaited Episode I to take us where we had never been: Darth Vader's history. And it comes out, not exactly what we had expected. Lucas' main mistake was trying to fit too much in to too little time. 3/4 of the viewers couldn't absorb it all. At one point he had 4 battles going on at the same time! Still, the effects are amazing, if too heavily relied on. Hope Episode II's better."
3,Where's the DVD?,I think not releasing this on DVD but on VHS was a BAD marketing move - and what's the deal anyway? Where's all the Indy flicks too! I'm not buying any LucasFilm/LucasArts DVD's until they treat DVD owner's fairly!Here we are - going out on a limb supporting a new technology - and a big company like LucasFilm won't release stuff on DVD! Give me a break!
2,25 Word Or Less Review,This is an excellent movie for people with a very low threshold of amusement. I highly recommend this film to the intellectually unambitious.
1,Star Bores,"So this was it? The great cinematic event of the 20th century I waited over a decade for this? What a dissapointment... As the film slowly wound its way to the final unoriginal, predictable ending, all I could think was ""when will this movie end...when will this movie end"" The most frustrating aspect of the movie was that the dialogue between Darth Maul and Sidious refered to an unexplained event between themselves and the Jedi forces; at one point Sidious states ""...and then we'll have our revenge.."" Revenge? Revenge for what? Boring, unintelligent, a huge let down from the ""original three"" George better clean up his act before Star Bores Episode II: The Return of Jar Jar"
4,Time sure goes by..,Well I went and watched phantom menace at the theatre when it first came out and I was just excited and happy to finally see the prequel to my beloved Star Wars..And what I got was a very well done movie that showed the start of Darth Vaders end and the beginning of Obe Wan's legacy..The battle scenes are well done in CGI.. and the costuming and casting is superb for this.There are two reasons that this movie received a 4 instead of a five.. One I felt that they dragged the intro of Anakin out wayyyyyyy to long.. there are a few things that could have been done differently to move it faster.. Second reason.. This like the first movie features actors that are not quite comfortable in there roles and it does show at times..Besides that this is a credit to the original Star Wars Series!
4,Why are scenes missing?,"As a huge Star Wars fan I was very excited about this movie and I was not disappointed at all when I saw it in the theatres. I was disappointed when I got my Widescreen Special Edition on video and noticed at least 4 (so far) scenes that were in the theatre but NOT on the video. They aren't major scenes and won't be missed if you didn't see it in the theatres, but it would have been nice if they were there. Other than that, this movie is a wonderful prelude to the entire Star Wars saga."
4,But no DVD?,"The sole purpose of my DVD purchase was to buy the P.M. when it came out, and to eagerly await the original trilogy's jump to DVD. Apparently, I may be a long time waiting, as Lucas has no plans for it to be released on DVD...Or is this perhaps another ploy to sell the video, then re-release it six months later with deleted scenes, and then re-re-release it again on DVD 5 years from now?People can kick and scream and complain about PM, but the fact is, it was brilliantly cast, directed and produced with some of the most incredible CG work in the world. True Star Wars fans will love it, but may be bothered by the fact that it won't be available on DVD."
1,Huge Disapointment,"I was REALLY looking forward to this movie when it came out. I am a big Star Wars fan (watched the movies hundreds of times, read the books, etc.) and had been watching the reports for another movie comming on its way. I rushed to see it and after the movie was over I sat there wondering ""What the heck was that?"" It was terrible. The whole story was ment to run on effects instead of a story line. Though it did follow the story I feel as though much of it was thrown together just around the computers and what they can do. The guy with the long ears (sorry don't know his name) was compleatly anoying and though he was there to be funny he was FAR from funny. Why does he need to be there? In the original Star Wars, there were no chars. added just for comic relief. They were funny on their own. I am not even sure if I will waste my time on the next one. It will probably be a waste of my time and 6 buck."
1,I finally broke down and watched this movie,"I finally broke down and watched this movie. About 10% of the way into it I re-affirmed my original wisdom. It was as anothe reviewer said ""tedious and boring"", that was at it's best. As far as I am concerned this movie ruined the spirit of the original trilogy for me, and destroyed the Star Wars mystique in my mind. When you compare Liam Neeson's role in ""Rob Roy"" to this disaster, you can see it Liams eyes, he appeared almost embarassed to be there. I was at first miffed that this was not released on DVD. After seeing it on VHS ( it was hideous ) I say to Lucas: ""don't bother"". This is the space version of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" I usually at least finish a movie when I see it, but this was an exception, I was bored silly about midway. The onoy other movie I stopped in the middle was ""BattleField Earth."" Yes folks, PM is THAT bad."
3,decent,"I thought this was a very good dvd.Jar Jar Binks stinks like nothing I've ever seen in a movie. A complete waste of film space, and completely unnecessary! He nearly RUINED the film. A few scenes could have been incredibly powerful were it not for him swaggering around with his floppy ears filling up half the screen.But I prefer streetbrawls.com There are even people who have taken the time to make Jar Jar hate sites! A total goof ball... agh... I can't go on writing about him."
4,A VERY GOOD OPENER,"This is a very good first cd. The standouts track are ""Dancing Nancies,"" ""Jimi Thing,"" ""Warehouse,"" & ""Ants Marching."" Tracks 8,11 & 34 sound like mere filler and the whole track 12-33 thing is annoying when I have all 3 studio albums on random play but I would rate this as one of the better debut cd's of all tme."
5,This CD is Amazing,"I bought this cd, and along with every other DMB CD on the market now, it's wonderful"
5,Good stuff,I don't know how or why I didn't already have this album - I've only heard it a million times - but I'm glad I found it for $5. Money well spent.
5,"Dave Matthews Band, you can't go wrong","This Cd is excellent. From ""The best of what's around"" to the "" # 36 "" this cd will make you feel good and experince the fun to listing a band with great melodies and lyrics."
4,"awesome, but not for everyone","i love DMB, but apparently this is one of those love em or hate em bands...most people who dont like them either hate the vocals (which i personally really like) or think that its boring. thats kinda how i felt about the 2nd half of the crash album...its slower but definitely not boring. if you listen to each of the individual instruments, and then see how it all meshes together its just awesome. DMB's music is complex and each member has tons of talent."
4,Old Cadfiel short stories,"In this volumne Peteers at last takes us back to the beginning when Cadfiel was still a returning crusader. In the course of the first story she tells us how he found his way into the monastery. Two other shrt stories give us a few more insights into his past as well. As a Cadgfiel fan, I found the stories interesting and enjoyable. But nothing in the title of the book lets you know that it is not another book in the chronological sequence that begins with ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" If you are looking for a typical book-length story like the others, you won't find it here.I love short stories (even better than full books) so I rate the volumne very favorably, Peters, of course, shows her usual skill at contirving puzzles to solve and Cadfiel's insights and skill in unravelling them."
5,Great quality (sound and build),"Stands work well with speakerset. Build quality good and assembly a snap. Hint: drop a piece of string through stand body and tape to the end of speaker wire to pull through, otherwise you'll spend all day trying to feed thicker wire."
5,Great book!,"This is realism at its finest--sharp, poignant, with plenty of redemptive moments but no magical solutions. Biewald's characters have to scrape and struggle for every scrap of luck. They dangle love in front of each other and then snatch it away.But don't worry: this isn't just a portrait of dysfunctional behavior. The characters move and grow and, ultimately, show us the kind of people they could have been long ago, if grief hadn't buried them.A finely crafted novel, well worth the read. Don't pass it by."
4,Almost perfect!,"This CD must be the best ever Gospel compilation by an individual artist, or group, in the history of recorded music, but it would have been perfect had most of the impromptu songs on Side 2, as well as one or two, also on this side, been left out in favour of the inclusion of one single additional song: the alternate take of ""You'll never walk alone"" (found on Platinum)My favourite of the ones I hadn't heard is ""There is no God, but God"". It soothes your soul, to no end! Check it out! Buy this 1996 CD, which incidentally is ranked #12 by Amazon.com in their gospel best-sellers list and, in the process, let's all make it go Triple RIAA Platinum, now!"
5,High Priestess for a reason...,"Yes. This is an excellent album. Everything Dr. Simone does is wonderful, but this is the most emotional album I've ever heard. ""Here Comes the Sun"" is, thanks to POINT OF NO RETURN, quite popular (and quite good, too). Nina singing Dylan is always remarkable, and ""Just Like a Woman"" is even better than ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" and ""I Shall Be Released"" from Volume One. In ""The Human Touch"" we get to hear a calm, melodic Simone... Her voice is perfectly-- PERFECTLY-- suited for singing Jacques Brel's songs. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" is powerful, but ""The Desperate Ones"" is even more emotionally (and artistically) extreme. AMAZING! Of course, ""My Way"" is terriffic. Imagine Nina Simone doing anything her way. Much better than the Sinatra version. MARVELOUS ALBUM. BUY IT!"
4,My fish keep attacking it!,I have aggressive fish and they will always seem to bite at the bottom for some odd reason. So i recommend this product if you know your fish won't try to break open the glass and allow mercury to get in their water.
3,"OK CD, if you like pure pop.","Mandy Moore is good, if you like pure pop. Her voice is good, and everything, but I'm not a total pop person. But I admit buying it; I listened it to awhile and eventually got bored of it and right now I think it's somewhere in my closet. If you are a pop person, go ahead and buy it-to me she just seems like another Britney Spears to me. I'd rate her CD a 7/10 because I don't like the type of music she sings. I like more rock-y people and bands like Avril Lavigne, T.a.T.u., and the band from the Josie and the Pussycats movie."
5,THE GREATEST CD!!,"Oh my gosh! this cd is so cool! i am mandy's biggest fan(seriously) but this cd is her best yet! i especially love these catchy tunes: Saturate Me, 17,Turn the Clock Around, and Cry! I got this as soon as my music store opened, and u should ALL get this cd! it has all these really catchy songs, great love ballads, and her voice is magnificant! please buy this cd and vote for Mandy's video IN MY POCKET on TRL! she deserves it!"
4,"Growing up, slowly and surely","After purchsing Mandy's last 2 albums, I was sure that I'd hear her next single all over the radio. Nope. I think I heard it once, and after listening to the album a few times I say it's a shame that radio hasn't embraced it more. ""Hand in my Pocket"" sounds nothing like anything else out there, and that's a good thing.So, Mandy may not do vocal acrobatics, but she still has a very pretty, silky voice. It doesn't matter that she's not reaching for a high c, she can sing. And, she seems to still be having fun, unlike some of her counterparts.As for the restof the album, I really enjoy a lot of the songs, but the one that I'm unsure about so far is ""Split Chick."" The rest are good quality pop music. Fun, easy to dance to, and they bring a smile to your face. It also helps that you can ""hear"" her smile!So, fave songs? ""Pocket,"" ""17,"" ""It Only Took a Minute"" and ""Crush."" I'm sure I'll end up loving the whole album, as I did her other two.Nice job Mandy!"
5,"A talent wasted, again.",Mandy has talent and yet it is wasted by the bland offerings of this album. There are some exceptions like In My Pocket and Cry. But that is it. Her voice is brilliant. It's only the songs. Maybe Mandy should try her own hand in songwriting. It would do her a lot more good than the ... the songwriters are giving her. I am hoping Mandy Moore will shine in her next album and not waste her talent again on such .... God bless.
2,2-1/2 stars -- Here's the problem...,"When Mandy Moore first came out, her lyrics were okay but the singing wasn't so good (remember ""Candy""?). I didn't hear her second album I Wanna Be With You - or maybe I did, because some of the songs from her first album are on it. On her self-titled album her singing has definitely improved, but as for the lyrics...The only song where Mandy's singing and the lyrics go hand in hand is the very last one, ""When I Talk To You"". ""Cry"" is okay too, and ""Crush"" is tolerable, but nothing else really impresses. Diane Warren's ""From Loving You"" isn't all it's cracked up to be, and to this day I don't know what ""In My Pocket"" is about. ""Split Chick"" is ridiculous, while ""Yo-Yo"" and ""Saturate Me"" are metaphoric mistakes.Maybe Mandy should get some better writers if she wants to stand out in the crowd. Because if she keeps going at this rate, people will probably just dismiss her and her albums as disposable pop mess."
5,"Man, does this thing have power","By the size of this thing, I didn't think it would be efficient for my take. But when you turn this bad boy on and open the valve all the way, it shoots out like a mini fire hydrant. The air hose it came with is also a nice feature to get air into your take if you place it under the water level. Very happy with this item. And at the price, who couldn't be?"
2,Serious design flaw,"Bought the cascade 300 to filter a 58qt. tub with a hatchling snapping turtle for a few months. The little filter has plenty power,circulates the water very well, runs pretty quietly and does a decent job with keeping the water clear. One problem is that that part of the filter is clear and you can always see all the filth that's inside and algae has started to grow in mine and seems impossible to clean out; it just doesn't look good.The next problem is that the way its made it has an opening in the front that my feeder minnows can swim into. I lose more fish by them swimming into the filter getting stuck inside and dying than I am by the turtle eating them. Luckily my turtle has gotten larger and it's now time to upgrade. If it wasn't for this problem this filter wouldn't be too shabby for a small turtle or amphibian."
2,Broke after 1 week,"This filter does not do very well with smaller substrates. My cascade filter died after about 1 week of use, and the motor was totally shot. The filter circulated the water well with a good flow rate, but this probably contributed to its substrate intake and demise. The filter would probably do a lot better in a tank with no substrate or larger sized substrates, but there are definitely sturdier choices available for internal filters.-TBM"
2,Not a complete product,Ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information. Was not like the picture. Returned 1st one and ordered a second which was identical to the first. Also was returned.
5,Art and business can learn from each other,"The popular view is that art and business are separate spheres of life. If not incompatible, pretty close. What these authors do is make an excellent case that this is not true and specifically that there is much that business can learn from art. They then offer specific suggestions. It is a very interesting and thought provoking book. It made me think differently about business and even a bit differently about life in general. Well worth the read."
1,Gold? HA! More like tarnished and rusted bronze,"This is horrid. They screwed with the Beatles!!! NOOO!!! How did they get the rights to the songs, anyway? Michael Jackson owns all of them. (red flag!)"
1,bad!,yay that guy who wrote the other review is so right. kidz bop cds suck .what about the real artists who wrote these good songs???? when kidz bop sings those songs they get ruined!!!!all the credit goes to them. they didn't even write the songs.
1,U MESSED WITH THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!!!,For the record I have never bought one of these pieces of junk they try to pass off as music and never WILL!!!! I hope you are all happy! You've officially tainted some of the best music ever with your high pitched pre-puberty voices! Yellow Submarine can never and shouldn't have ever been done by anyone but THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!! in the future please leave the singing to those peoples with some taste and artistry! Who is the guy trying to be Ual Mc Cartney in Here comes the sun! I normall ysing this song to make myself feel better: but now I'll only be able to think of those freakishly squeaky voices!GOOD JOB(I only gave it a star because my review wouldn't have been put up if i didn't)
2,there will always be crapola in the world,"honestly people, this is like making fun of Barney. Who cares? I winced when I added Kidz Bop 4 to my shopping cart but that is what my nephew wants for Christmas (...not MY kids and NOT in MY house ! ). I would rather have bought him KidzBop Gold, at least he could have learned the words to The 59th Street Bridge Song and Here Comes the Sun instead of Complicated or My Boo, some of the songs they have to censor but the subject matter is the same and its just wrong... Did they make kids' versions of Stones and Zeppelin songs? ...that would have been cute...or Romeo Void or Van Halen? kiddy porn. But anyway I think KIdzBop Gold is the best one, if you can call it that..."
1,Sigh...,"Just when we all thought Kidz Bop couldn't get any worse, it did. The kids sound bad enough singing songs we like, what makes people think we'll like the kids singing songs that went out years ago? Some of them still sound good, but just the thought of the kids singing these songs is disgusting. Save your money and buy a different retro CD. Your ears will thank you, I guarantee!"
2,fragile,"In the dark I nudged it off my 2ft high night stand onto a carpeted floor. The clock reset itself back to midnight with date 01/01. The ""radio controlled"" feature is broken. Should be more robust look elsewhere."
1,"Don't bother, it's cheap but it's useless","I purchased this device on the fly while looking for a pulse rate watch. The closest competetion was $50 plus so I thought I'd give it a try. One click buy later I decided to read the reviews! Wow how bad could it be for [item price]? Well, today I received it, the battery was dead and after trying to replace it , a small spring popped out. Ten minutes later I'm still wrestling with it and finally get it together! Then I find another even smaller spring! This review is the last bit of time I will spend on this small poorly designed product. I will read the reviews before I ""One Click"" next time!"
1,nire in iowa,Pathetic and scary. People in Idaho haven't heard of sexually transmitted diseases? This woman was doing more than her part to spread what's out there. And after decades of feminism this is where we end? A whiney nincompoop feeling she's failed utterly if she hasn't latched on to a man (apparently ANY man) to prove she's really alive. I didn't find this even remotely funny just sad sad sad and depressing
1,Narcissism on Parade,This woman is such a disgusting social climber with a daddy fixation. I am sure she wrote the book to move into a different strata not because she's a great writer (because she's not). It felt so self absorbed and so attempting to be clever. Don't buy this book. The whole premise is bonkers from someone who was desperate for her five minutes of fame. She got it and Thank God it's over. Did anyone see that humiliating interview on the Today show with her and her creepy husband twice her age. Stomach turning! Katie Couric could barely conceal her contempt.
1,Truthiness,Anyone else considering the possibility that she made it all up? Doesn't it fit the mold of every young midwestern girl's fantasy of what New York is a little to patly? Does anyone else feel that this is just too contrived too narratively convenient to be even close to reality? Because I sure as hell do.
4,Sex and the City for Smart Girls,"This book is hysterical and inspiring. It's about a real woman with very believable dating neuroses. I felt connected to her dating experiences, although I've never dated a homeless man who thought he was Jimi Hendrix but my ex was pretty close. I would read anything she writes in the future."
3,Not the best !!,Purchased this hose in June 2012. Already leaking (hole in hose). Hose kinks must be used straight out or loses pressure.
3,O.K. book about Indians fleeing their home,"This book is an ok book. I did not find it very detailed. I would suggest to read this book if you're o.k. with lots of people dying and being scalped etc...It wasn't the best book I have read. It only lightly touches on the big details and gives a very boring afterward. It is easy to read, though and could be a useful reference to how cruel people have been to the poor Indians. If you want a book filled with excitement, this won't fill the bill."
1,Don't bother,"If you are interested in learning about the way the Native Americans were once treated, this may be a good choice for you. Personally, I did not appreciate it all. The violence was extensive. It was just plain horrible. I certainly would not recommend it for young children, or anyone is easily upset by violence. Historically however, it is well done. ""My Name Is Not Angelica"" was better."
1,STAY AWAY!,"This dictionary is poorly edited (with numerous typos), incomplete (random information that does not reflect the needs of a basic speaker) and, in parts, embarrassingly childish (the introduction suggests, among other bizarre comments, that Bosnian may be too difficult to bother to learn well? ).Although it is difficult to find detailed Bosnian dictionaries, older English/Serbo-Croatian variants are still quite relevant (the nuances for advanced usage notwithstanding) and the English/Bosnian dictionary from Nikolina S. Uzicanin is a SIGNIFICANTLY better purchase (for a pocket-sized book) than this one."
3,103.1 Sean Rubio In the Mix,"Well, if u miss Groove 103.1 as i do, we would do anything to get hear music like that agiain. But this CD, isn't like the kind of mix Sean Rubio did on Groove, it totally different. This CD is mostly ""Trance"" rather than ""Dance"" or ""Techno"". My opinion is.. i don't really like it"
3,Not A Great Buffy Book,This is not my most favorite Buffy book. I really wanted to like it but found that I couldn't get into it.I couldn't even finish the book. It does have it's moments. It isn't a bad book.Just not that great.
3,Another entry in the Jedi Quest series,"After reading all of the Jedi Apprentice books and many of the Jedi Quest books, many story elements begin to repeat themselves. It seems that many of these books follow the same plot, one of the protagonists gets captured, the other protagonist disguises himself as a maintenance worker to sneak in and make the rescue, then they escape and save the planet in less then 24 hours. Maybe I'm expecting too much from a book that's targeted to a younger audience, but it seems there must be something more that can be added to these stories. Not only are the plots simple, but there is little descriptive text about the aliens, planets, or any of the other characters in the book. I think these books would be better with an additional twenty or thirty pages so that there could be more immersion into the uniqueness of the Star Wars universe. As it is, there's nothing really special about this book."
2,Projection is too small,"I have several Oregon Scientific Atomic projection clocks and rely on the projected time on the ceiling. When my last one quit projecting, I ordered this as a replacement. While it looks identical to my older Oregon Scientific clocks - the projection is indeed very small. It is at least 1/3 the size of my original clocks. Very hard to see. The other functions of the clock work great - but the projection is way too small and cannot be rotated or adjusted like the older clocks. I ended up taking one of my originals from a guest room and replacing it with this new clock. If you don't care about the projection, the clock is great."
2,not what it use to be,"I had an older Oregon Scientific projection clock that worked great. No matter where the clock was you could rotate the time on the ceiling so it could be read in bed. This clock you can not rotate the display, so position the clock is critical if you want to read it on the ceiling. Also you can't adjust the size, too small and not very bright. Very disappointed with this"
1,not happy,Not bright enough or big enough... :(I had hoped this would be a larger font and brighter. I cannot see it without my contacts in.
1,poor product,A very poorly designed product - time is difficult to read in the light (it doesn't light up) and projected time is so small I can barely make it out. Would never buy it again.
1,Worthless,"The actual article that arrived seems to be six years old. The manual is very limited, and I had a problem with the orientation of the display. Both the customer support phone number and the website were no longer active. After I found a site via Google for Oregon Scientific, I attempted to tell them about my problem. To do so they demanded that I provide the UPC code from the package. After digging that out of the trash, I submitted my request, only to receive an email from them a few minutes later stating ""Action failed... access denied""!!!!!!!!The clock is worthless crap! Their customer is worse than non-existent - it is insulting and time wasting. This junk is going back just as soon as I can get it to the Post Office!"
1,Disappointing Oregon Scientific Product,"This is my third Oregon Scientific projection clock so I had few misgivings even after reading some negative customer reviews. I was so mistaken for not taking heed! This is a terrible product. First, the project effect is minimal and impossible to see because there is ZERO magnification. Also, the clock and alarm settings are not intuitive at all and it makes using them frustrating. I wish I had kept the receipt and returned it but I am just going to put it in a spare bedroom and try to find a projection clock that actually projects with some sort of magnification so I can SEE the time at night on my ceiling or wall as I intended."
4,funny,it was just as funny as the series but to under stand the plot you have to watch the first 5 seasons
1,the worst quality,"the price is cheap but the quality is the worst. The black tint is gray and the colors, you can't define. It's better find another seller."
1,Not worth the $$$,"Not easy to put together as most of the screw holes, especially for the drawer, are misaligned. The hex wrench that comes with it strips out more screws then it secures properly, and nothing on the cart seems to fit securely. It's very wobbly when any force is out on it. The quality just really isn't what I expected for this price. I would certainly return this product if not for the hassle of taking it apart again and shipping it back. Really a big disappointment.Eventually I did end up returning it for a refund."
4,Genealogy of the settlers of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon in the,"Carl Laurence Duaine provides an excellent insight into the historical background of the first settlers of the nothern provinces of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon (northern New Spain late 1500s and early 1600s). Duaine describes the fate of the first settlers of Nuevo Leon who came with Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva to Nuevo Leon from their origins in Spain or Portugal to Nuevo Leon. His detail listing of names make this remarkable book an excellent source for genealogy research. Mr. Duaine could have listed his sources for his research. However, the reader can use the aouthor's research and statments to dig further into the history and genealogy of the men and women of the northern frontier of New Spain who are the ancestors of many Hispanics who traced their roots to Texas and northern Mexico."
5,A media server made easy,"The combination of AppleTV, an iTunes server, and an iPod Touch remote for the whole system has made our music and movie enjoyment much, much greater. The AppleTV/iTunes combo makes it very easy to set up a wireless media storage and playback combination through your living room home theater system.The only slight complaint I have is that the appleTV isn't always automatically found by the remote iTunes server after a re-start, meaning I have to go through the code entry nonsense again. However, this is rare, and doesn't otherwise detract from a great system.Oh, and 40 gigs is more than plenty if you are using an external system to stream content to the AppleTV. Otherwise, I might suggest the bigger drive."
3,Won't replace Netflix,"I wanted to cancel Netflix and use the Apple TV as a replacement. There is a very limited selection of titles you can rent, and buying everything will get way too expensive. Its fine if you want to spend $15 for a soft copy of a movie or $50 for a season of TV shows but that is too steep for me."
2,not for everyone,"I don't buy or rent from iTunes, I rip my DVD's. I really got the AppleTV so I can control what movies my child watches by ripping certain movies onto the AppleTV for her, then she can pick and choose on her own.The good thing about AppleTV is that it allows you to organize and watch your movies like you have video on demand. The bad thing is that there is no playlist support for movie organization, just one big long list.There are a few more bad thing about it that really stands out. It sits there hot even on standby. It is slow - takes forever to start any kind of HD download. The HD only supports maximum data rate of 5 Mbps H.264, better than DVD but not as good as OTA HD or Blu-ray. The SD trailers look terrible.It definitely deserves its ""hobby"" status."
4,Great,"My only complaint is the inability to connect a wireless keyboard for easier searching. Otherwise, this thing is great!"
1,Mainly for video from iTunes,"Why spend $300 on a hardware device that really is only good for playing video content downloaded from the iTunes store? Right now the quality of that iTunes video is not even as good as DVDs. Personally I own a few hundred DVDs. Although one can convert individual titles from DVDs to Apple TV compatible files using Handbrake, this process is very time-consuming and fruitless. The quality is not as good as the original. You lose all the menus, subtitle options, (true) surround sound, and director's commentaries. When I converted a dance DVD made from a telecast, the frame rate was decreased to 24 fps and the dancing became very jittery. When I used the 29.97 fps of the original, iTunes would play the file on my computer, but refused to sync it with the Apple TV. Although glitches like these may be fixed in time, they are very frustrating right now. I returned my Apple TV for a full refund."
4,Great Product For Price,Pros:- Cheap- Good HD quality- Movie Rentals- Ease of use- Well built- Looks greatCons:- Limited functionality and playback options- Small hard drive with no option of upgrading using external sources.- Syncing can take a while- Must store movies on a home computer or ATV. Cannot redownload multiple timesOverall this media center is a great bang for it's buck. Highly recommend with the price cut! Take Two software makes it even better!
3,gets you started,"this will get you started on working on your own motorcycle, But if you want the ultimate source of motorcycle mechanics knowledge, get the latest Honda Common Service Manual. at least get the edition that is newer than the bikes you will be working on. Older versions are free on the net if you look."
4,Good Product - some drawbacks,"Heating with this unit for volumes under 4oz is hit or miss. The amount of water needed, indicated by the calibration on the tube to fill, is guesswork. Still, this device is very good at heating bottles and it sure beats submerging a bottle in hot water and waiting a very long time - especially when a baby is crying. The unit heats f-a-s-t! Again, at lower volumes, I suggest using more water and monitoring the unit. It is usually under 90 seconds anyway for smaller volumes. At larger volumes (4 oz plus), you should have no problem with the unit.Very good money spent."
5,serves its purpose,"This bottle warmer serves its purpose just as well as the other more expensive warmers with bells and whistles. My baby sleeps through the night, so there was no need to have an insulated unit to keep bottles cooled overnight. Besides, I just pull bottles out of the refrigerator. The temperature doesn't come out exactly the same each time, but it does take the chill off the milk enough to satisfy my baby. It works great with all sizes of bottles, including Avent 9 oz bottles. Furthermore, this unit is smaller than other bottle warmers, therefore it doesn't take up too much countertop space. Great product!"
2,disappointed,"Well I thought this would save me time with my second child - warming up breastmilk in a hurry. It has been inconsistent and not trustworthy so far. Out of the 6 times I've tried it - 2x it was WAY too hot and I didn't have time to cool it off. And the rest of the times it wasn't hot enough. Maybe I misread the directions, but they weren't the clearest either. I'll give it another shot - but at this point it's more reliable to just use a pan/cup of hot water."
1,Got burned,DON'T BUY THIS WARMER!This warmer only works every once in a while. Today it boiled the breastmilk in the bottle and didn't shut off! Often times it warms the bottle to much making the milk to hot for my baby (any baby for that matter). And other times it doesn't warm the bottle at all.
1,What a pain,"I bought this bottle warmer while I was pregnant because it was the cheapest one Babies R Us had and it has all of the safety features. After trying to get this thing to work for about a month, I finally splurged on the Avent bottle warmer. This warmer is impossible to use! Everytime you want to use it, you have to fill up this tiny measuring thing that clips onto the side of the warmer which is impossible when you have a crying baby in your arms. If you leave the bottle in the warmer until it automatically shuts off the bottle will be scortching hot! You also have to take the bottle out of the warmer with a towel because the it will be covered in boiling water."
2,Doesn't warm well,"This warmer does a fantastic job of warming about two ounces of liquid if you use the maximum amount of water. If you're trying to heat up anything more than a snack for your baby, you're going to have to either run it through several cycles in a row, or just find another way to warm it up. This warmer emits a lot of steam and barely accomplishes a thing. I wish I had kept the receipt from my purchase at Target so I could get my $20 back."
3,overflow issue,"This is useful for those middle of the night warm ups, I actually keep it in our upstairs bathroom with a cooler for our bottles to avoid treking downstairs in the middle of the night. If you leave the bottles in the warmer, they can overflow and cause a scumy build up on the warming plate. This happened to us with soy formula and it really smelled! Also make sure you don't overfill with water or it can splatter...otherwise works well."
2,Completely inconvenient,"As many other reviews have said this bottle warmer is totally inconsistent. There is a fill line but it doesn't really matter. It heats differently every time. We have only been using it for 3 months and I think it broke this week. I left it unattended and it never turned off so the formula started boiling and I wasted 5 ounces of formula. Also, I don't know if it's the bottles we are using or the warmer but something is causing our bottles to leak all over the warmer and we have this terrible soy formula burning smell throughout our house. I think it's the warmer doing it because when we warm the bottles in a pan on the stove we don't have a problem with the bottles leaking. It has become much easier just to warm bottles the old fashioned way on the stove since this warmer is so unreliable."
4,MUST HAVE,"This is a great product! I have bought 3 additional ones for baby showers after I used the first one myself. It is quick and easy. Although you have to guess how much water to put in the warmer, but you will get used to it pretty quickly. I can't live without it and recommend it to everyone."
4,can't get it just right,I find that I have trouble getting each bottle to the perfect temperature. It either under or overheats about half the time. But it is convenient and compact and it does do it's job even on the wideneck bottles. Wish it came with a travel pouch/carry handle b/c I take it with me for overnight traveling
2,Inconsistant!!!,"My review would read exactly as H.G. from Westland, MI -- very inconsistant for who knows what reason when you are heating the same size bottle each time! I have used it for 7 weeks, and am on my way to find a better one. Spend the extra $$, if that helps -- I'll soon find out if it does!"
1,Melts Plastic Bottles,"When searching for bottle warmers, my wife and I were aware we would need a product that would not destroy plastic. We thought we found the product we were looking for in this bottle warmer. Imagine our surprise when, after the first warming, the bottom edge of our Playtex Drop-in System bottle had melted! Needles to say, we are hugely disappointed."
1,Product was of such poor quality,"I thought this was the coolest thing, when I discovered it just before my baby was born. HOWEVER, after 2 weeks of using it, the numbers on the measuring tube wore completely off!!!! It also developed some brown crust in the bottom. It did come off, but who wants to clean one more thing when you have a brand new baby at home. It did warm bottles nicely though and fairly quickly. However, a plain old pot of hot water works wonderfully and doesn't cost a thing, and you don't have to measure!!!!"
1,waste of money,we returned this bottle warmer because it took a lot more effort and time to warm the bottle in this warmer than just put a bottle in a mug and run hot water. absolute waste.
2,The quality is going downhill,"I purchased my first botther warmer in 2011, the color was dark gray.. have no complain at all. perfect!! stupid me, bring this overseas and forgot to use the volt converter so it blew up hence i have to purchase a new one. However i cannot find the dark gray anymore, go to W supermarket and purchase from Amazon, and end up getting this new version - the light blue and white version.I practically have to heat up twice in order to be warm. sometimes only heat it once and it burning hot.Seems cannot get it right. Hate it so much, good thing my daughter is drinking whole milk now so micrawave is my new best friend, i have enough with this warmer"
1,WASTE OF TIME AND $,This was purchased in an attempt to save time - it actually doubles the time needed to heat a bottle. The reason is that you try the warmer only to find out it doesn't work (heats the bottle but not the milk) and then you are forced to heat by hand with hot water.
1,Doesn't work!,"We couldn't get this warmer to work. It would heat the bottle just great, but the milk inside was still cold. Because you have to wait 10 mins before you can use it again, we found it worthless. Our goal was to speed warming time, but using hot water took the same amount of time as this product. We returned it and got the Avent one and are much happier."
4,Great Warmer,This is a must have item.... I've been using the Avent warmer and it either made the bottle too hot or not warm enough and in the middle of the night it is a hassle to have a bottle that is not ready for a screaming baby. So this warmer it is great although the instructions tell you to use 7oz of water for 4 oz of milk... I find that the milk doesn't get warm enough so I use 8oz and it works great. The only thing that I wish it could improve is that you have to put water every time you warm the bottle. I think it should automatically refill it self after each use.
3,Better products out there,This bottle warmer is slow and seems to accumulate some guck at the bottom. It does get the job done so I gave it three stars.
2,So disappointed!!!,"I registered this item for my Baby Shower, but I ended up so disappointed because even though is compact (great on your countertop), reasonable price, and quick!, it's very hard to find the correct water measurement. You either get it too hot or too cold and you have to run cold/hot water under the sink for it to warm up or cool off. Who has time for that when you have a baby crying telling that he is hungry.This would have been a great product if the actual instructions would work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS []!!!!Jan 24, 2003 - I am rewriting the review since i finally figured out the problem of being too hot and cold. This system works if you dont make the bottles ahead and put them in the refrigerator; in other words, make the bottle right then and there, so you cant have the bottles already prepared with the formula but it only takes 2 seconds to do, and if you have a hungry baby just prepare it a few minutes before you think he's going to start crying."
1,Not for Playtex Drop Ins,"This bottle warmer is not for the Playtex Drop In system. Although the instructions say it is suitable for these bottles, I ruined 2 before I gave up on it. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with cold breastmilk and melted bottles. I returned this item."
2,Good if don't expect much,"I should give this product 3 stars. It is quicker than using boiled water. Also convenient because you do not need to worry about turning off anything. But just as other reviews, the performance is unpredictable. Sometimes it gives too hot sometimes not warm enough. I am using Dr.Brown's narrow bottles. For 3 ounce cold breast milk, water at level 6 (suggested by the manual) only makes it not cold. Anyway, I would say it is really fast.However I would like to give only 2 stars because I received a used one!!!!! It is so dirty on the bottom of the basket!!!!!!! This is really ridiculous for a product sold by Amazon!!!!! But I really need it immediately for I do not want to boil water in the midnight. Also the price at this time is acceptable. Next time I would require a replacement. Just be aware."
3,Inconsistent heating,"It is slow, inconsistent but it gets the job done, sometimes too well. The breast milk ends up boiling and I have to run it under cool water. This is first ottle warmer I have owned, so nothing to compare to, besides a glass of hot water. I don't think this is much faster!"
4,Works for disposable bottles,"I was tired it taking forever to warm my disposable bottles and tried this bottle warmer out. I am happy with my purchase although I am still trying to find the ""magic"" amount of water to heat the bottle. They either get too hot or not quite hot enough. But I would say it is a good buy and worth it."
1,The auto shut off didn't work,I bought this bottle warmer but when it arrived the auto shut off function wasn't working. So i returned it and i got a new one. Same problem. Now i am returning it again and i will buy a different brand. Maybe i wasn't lucky...but i am definitely disappointed by the product.
2,Don't waste your money,I'm only going to say: measuring system doesn't work! Sometimes i have to use the warmer 3 times because with the measuring they suggest the milk stays cold!
2,Not impressed...,"This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to. However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle. It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold. By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle. The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top. That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning. You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us."
1,Steamy,Don't like it at all I was just looking for a simply bottle warmer but i got this thing that steams to heat and it heats uneven to slow and to fast.The directions about how to measure the water it confusing. i have used other warmers in the past and wish that i had remembered their names so i didn't end up buying this one.
4,i like it but,i dont like that if you stop it mid cycle when you come back to warm another bottle it starts halfway through the cycle. it does not re-set. it warms by steam. there is a hotplate at the bottom then you pour water into the chamber and the steam that is created warms the bottle. it comes with the container that you fill up with the water to pour in.
2,Does the job. I guess,"Pros: heats a bottleCons: No auto shutoffTo any first time parent, you will NEED some type of auto shutoff once it hits 100 degrees. Trust me. It's always the things you don't think about, and then your wife's hard earned milky white gold is scorched and you are left looking like an idiot for letting all 4 ounces of your screaming kids milk boil into a stinking mess all over the kitchen counter at 2am, only to have your exhausted wife look at you in disbelief as you explain your case.Fella's don't repeat my mistake. Here is your warning."
3,Nice to have,"It's small and efficient. HINT: when in doubt, take the bottle out, shake the contents and assess temp. if still cold put back in if not go ahead and use... It's cheaper than warming up bottles by running tapwater and less cumbersome than using the microwave to heat water to then heat up bottle... although it needs some tweaking (or more precise add-watter guidelines) I'd buy it again."
2,Pointless item,"It may be my son only but he doesn't care if his bottles are cold or warm and I use water that is in gallon containers which sit on the counter so his bottles are generally at room temperature anyway. This product did work, however, for my standard size Playtex Vent Air bottles but did not heat up my friend's wide mouth bottles when she tried to use it. All in all, this was a pointless purchase on my part; but the return of the item was easy cheesy!"
1,Teflon comes off,We found that the teflon on the bottom came off after a couple months of using this product. I am replacing it with another product and am disapointed that it only lasted about 2 months.
4,I like it,It saves us from having to go down stairs to heat a bottle. You have to find the right amount of water to heat up a little trial and error but a great product. If you are lazy like me i say buy this. Ha ha
3,disappointed,"In my undergraduate days, vying for a Ford Foundation Fellowship against stiff competition, (which I won), I was mentored by the great Lothar Witteborg, then Chair of the Department of Exhibition of the Field Museum of Natural History, with complete carte Blanche to roam the museum at will, study and note behind the scenes activities. There, in the midst of a triple BA, in Architectural Exhibit Design, Painting and Anthropology, I was captivated by the huge murals Charles Robert Knight throughout the building.I was expecting a book with full color reproductions of his murals. I should have read the details but I got it confused with the full color calendar, so I ordered the wrong item. This book, though the cover is in color is full of only black and white pencil/charcoal preliminary sketches of paintings to come. So, if that is what you are looking for, this is the book, but if you want color images, this is not."
2,Don't Start This Series With this Book!,"I have to say that I am very disappointed in M. I have loved the series so far but I have picked up and put down this book at least 15 times. With the others, I barely stopped reading long enough to run to the bathroom!! The characters lack depth, the most interesting character gets murdered, and quite honestly, the other characters are so ..., I didn't even care who did it. Overall, great series, poor book."
4,M is for Malice=A suspenseful novel,"M is for Malice was the first book that I read from the Sue Grafton alphabet series. The book was easy to follow and thoroughly understandable for those who have not yet read other books in the series. The plot was realistic, and I enjoyed the emotions brought about by the selfish Malek brothers and their disowned sibling who had long awaited reunion only to find nobody cares about him. This book was easy reading and suspenseful until the last page."
4,"An easy, fun read","""M"" is my first Sue Grafton book but definitely not my last. I intend to buy A-L and work through the series. It was an interesting book, but not too heavy and not too gory."
4,Interesting,"Imagine being attacked by everyone, including your own family for actions in the past when in fact the real culprit was the other brothers."
1,M Is For Malice,"This is a completely sub-standard ""closed-room"" cozy mystery that lacks plot, good characters, and movement. I've read a number of Sue Grafton mysteries and she seems to get lazier -- or just more complacent with her core readers -- with every book. There's way too much description about things that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, which really doesn't get started until more than halfway through the book. In fact, the murder -- which usually propels a good contemporary mystery -- doesn't even happen until around the 200-page mark. If you want to read what Kinsey Millhone is eating, wearing, or driving, this book is for you...otherwise, forget it."
3,Not Up To Par,"I'm a big fan of Sue Grafton's, but I was disappointed in this installment in the Kinsey Millhone series. The first half of the book was tedious. Too much introspection by Kinsey. Detailed descriptions of every room she enters and the clothes worn by everyone she meets. Things improve when she finally has a murder to solve, but the mystery itself wasn't challenging. Maybe it's time to branch out and find some new characters, these are getting a little stale."
2,Slow and Boring,This is the first and probably the last of Sue Grafton's alphabet books I will read. The storyline is slow to develop and I didn't find any of the characters very interesting. It was only half way through the book that anything interseting developed. M Is for Maybe Her Next Book Will be Better.
2,Depressing and disappointing,"I've loved most of Sue Grafton's books, but this and her last have been downbeat and slow. Kinsey isn't as much fun as she used to be!"
4,Worth the price.,"This product was recommended by Fine Cooking Magazine. They usually know what they are talking about. After years of pinched fingers and uncrackable nuts I was ready to pay $14.00 for a nut cracker. Well it works, even on Brazil nuts. But it often doesn't crack almonds if they are small. And it's kid friendly! I don't have to stop what I'm doing every other nut and crack it for them."
1,terrible,I didnt even get my package and the tracking number is invalid. i would like you to send me what i ordered bc you took the money and didnt send it. so i think i was ripped off!
5,Good First Book for Literature,"It can be a tricky task, trying to suggest non-lesson-book pieces to very young students. If the book contains something other than the subjects present in the lesson book, we run the risk of frustrating the student. That is why I really like the ""Introduction to Classics to Moderns"" text. It has just enough challenging material without being out of the league of younger players. The subjects presented are fun, but educational at the same time, and because the pieces are presented outside of a lesson-book format, the students must rise to the occasion by meeting whatever the pieces require. All in all, a great buy, I also have a series of YouTube tutorials based off of this text at: [...]"
5,Older purchase of Oregon Scientific Remote Sensor THR138,Probably can't find these anymore but was the cheapest price for this sensor which worked excellent with other Oregon Scientific weather monitors that I own.
3,Buyers Beware,"This is a sensor for the older models. It does not work with the latest offerings from Scientific Oregon. I own 3 Scientific Oregon Thermometers. That are all very good. Two of them are from the older line, and I just bought a new one today. The old sensors won't talk to the new main unit, and the new sensor won't talk to the old main units. I wished they preserved backwards compatibility but they didn't. Oh well!"
4,Oregon Scientific Remote Thermo Sensor,"This is a great way to monitor the temperature in another location. It can either be inside or outside, but it must be within 60 feet of the main unit. Walls or other obstacles can reduce the distance. You can monitor up to three different locations.The only problem I have encountered is that the main unit sometimes loses track of a remote unit. However, it always automatically found the unit within a few minutes."
2,there must be better ones out there,over sized and fairly noisy makes this a paper shredder you should probably pass on.
1,Warning: 2009 remaster is horrible!,"Neil Young - Harvest (1972)I'm hardly an audiophile and sometimes I actually get annoyed with reviews that trash albums because of the remastering job. But even I can hear how bad this version sounds. It sounds flat but with too much bass and not enough treble. It's muddy and sounds like it's compressed to hell! (note - some audiophiles in the comments below have analyzed the sound waves and claim there's no frequency ""clipping"", but that still doesn't mean it sounds good - to my ears, it sounds terrible!)This rating has nothing to do with the music itself - it's intended to warn people to avoid this particular release. As for the music, I would rate HARVEST four stars on the strength of its best songs, especially ""Heart of Gold,"" ""Old Man,"" and ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" which rank among his best ever."
4,An asset to the library,"Excellent as an additional resource, but not a stand alone reference textbook. Should be in every therapists office!"
5,THE ORIGINAL DIRTY DANCER!,"Almost every teen ager in the fifties loved the hot R&B dance music. The personifacation of ""dirty dancin'"" came when Hank Ballard's Midnighters sang those double entendre lyrics to classics like ""Work With Me Annie"" and ""Annie Had A Baby"". This fabulous compilation produced by the Masters at ACE RECORDS has made these classic dance cuts come alive with new vibrance. These fabulous recordings have been restored to flawless perfection. Every cut on this CD is fabulous. The original ""The Twist"" is the best I've ever heard it. Along with ""Henry's Got Flat Feet"", ""Finger Poppin' Time"" and ""Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go"", all sound the best I've ever heard. I've heard the ""Twist"" thousands of times and on this CD, I hear things I've never heard before. The durums, the backup singers and the saxaphones are in your face. It's fabulous. If you want to take a trip back to the good time days of rock'n roll and r&b. Take my advice, this one is well worth your time and money."
3,"i love robbie williams but,......",robbie williams is a great artist he comes out with great ballads and great dance songs but..... he is kind of lacking like he use to to for me...especially for the track 'angels'... this song is suppose to be written for a female. you can tell by the high notes he is trying to hit on the song... a strong female voice should be able to hit it....like jessica simpson...hehe. she sounded excellent on her version... but that is another story...robbie is great but he is fading in the states and needs a huge comback to get my attention again....
4,good daily time with God,I like the format in some ways I found myself wanting more some days on the topics than was given. It was almost an empty feeling. I love the way they had more time however on Sundays and I have never seen that in any other book and found this format very intriguing and spiritually uplifting
2,A Bit Disappointed,"The Title of the book does not clearly define the pages that follow. I am disappointed in the way the book was setup, and content thereof. I expected the information to be more inspiring than it is. But, its an okay Devotional."
3,This gadget is not bad at all with this price,"This inexpensive pedometer does its job as long as you handle it correctly. It measure the steps very accurate after a very easy adjustment. The heartbeat rate works ok. At first, I press my finger to the two spots at the back, and the reading is not stable. But when I just put my finger in the loop and use this single finger hold it, the heartbeat reading is very accurate. I guess this is the right way to use it."
3,"Nice pedometer, nice features, but...","I bought this about a week ago, and I'm glad I got it. It does pulse measurement, and calorie calculation (based on weight, so it's at least trying to be accurate). So far, so good -- it's been fairly accurate, and I'm glad I got it.But, my one gripe about it is that the hinge design's a little weak. It can be difficult to open when it's hanging on your waist, and because it's difficult to open, the little pins holding the cover on it have a tendency to pull out. They're easily reseated with an unbent paperclip, but it's not necessarily something I want to worry about while I'm walking along.One week later, and one of the hinge pins has snapped. The other one is seated firmly, and while the case is stiff to open now, it's at least holding securely. I've moved this from a 4 to a 3."
3,Good story,"Kind of hard to belive John Wayne as a German Sea Capt. but then again one does not watch a John Wayne film for his accent ability. I like this picture, have seen it many times."
4,John Wayne at Sea,"As usual, John Wayne plays the strong type with a sense of duty to his country if not it's cause. Even though Wayne is not a Nazi, he feels duty bound to get his German steamer home. The characters are rich and the story line is good. A must see for any Wayne fan or action fan."
4,A surprising engaging movie,"The only reason I gave this movie rating 4 stars is that it is impossible to listen to John Wayne's voice and accept the fact that he is cast as a German freighter captain. It fits that he is both patriotic and anti-Nazi in the movie, but he simply doesn't come across well as a German.It's surprising therefore, that the rest of the movie works so well. Best friends and now political and romantic rivals chase each other across much of the south Pacific. There are spies, secret allegances, and other intruige galore. It's well worth a look, though I'd rate it in the category of B-movies (which I very much like)."
5,Stupendous,"It stupefies me that one company can get something so right when another is way off. When my son was 7 months old I purchased on a whim the So Smart Letters and the Colors DVDs. He has loved watching both them, which I'm sad to say isn't true for any of the Baby Einstein videos I've got for him. Now at a year old he gets excited as soon as he sees the So Smart splash screen. I would be eager to recommend these DVDs to anyone."
2,Boring,This video is very boring and SLOW. I have a 22 month old and it didn't hold his attention 10 minutes. It seems like someone could have made this on his or her computer and passed it off as entertainment. It may be good for very small babies but not for ones that are used to Baby Einstein and things that captivate their attention.
5,Excellent product...a must have,"I am a student at a major university and it keeps everything from homework assignment, deadline and other project organized and convenient. It sure beats using a dayplanner. It has it all, I do know how I had ever managed to keep organized, more or less live with out this outstanding product. If your a student or anyone who like to be organized BUY it, it is worth every penny!"
1,Lost all my data--twice,"Does Palm have a problem it's not admitting? My two-day old Palm IIIx lost all its data this morning--garbage on the screen, no response to power button. A soft reset ""restored"" the unit--not the data, of course, just the factory defaults.Funny thing is, the Palm IIIx replaced a Palm III which had lost all its data the day before I bought the new one. I figured the old Palm III had probably had it, but at least it had served faithfully for two years. The new Palm IIIx didn't make it through two days.Palm tech support says the ""solution"" to lost data is a reset. Sure it is--that restores the unit to its factory condition. And then you synchronize it again to restore from your desktop. And again and again and again? Tonight will be the third attempt to get the data I depend on every day from my desktop to a Palm III model. All I want is a Palm IIIx that can hang on to my data for more than a day!"
5,The little engine that could,"I bought by Palm IIIx on a whim. I figured, ""Well, everyone else seems to think they're great."" They were right. The Palm IIIx is fantastic. For me, the best features are its address book and the ""To Do List."" Gone are the little scraps of paper I used to use to keep all my lists of stuff to do. I've been completely neglecting my paper address book ever since I got the IIIx. Between its small size, its ease of use, and its versatility, this Palm is a winner all around. BTW, I highly recommend the O'Reilly PalmPilot guide to go with it. Like all O'Reilly books, this one cuts right to the chase. It makes the IIIx even easier to use."
3,Looks cheap; but good for children's room,"I bought this clock to set on the master bedroom nightstand, but the plastic makes the clock look cheap so I returned it. I would recommend this clock for a children's room only."
5,Guinness for the Mind,"Like Guinness, this book is both filling and tastes great!Why America Never Invaded America is a blast to read. It is PG-13 only because the author uses LBJ as an example, a good example at that. This is a book that really should be read by any Entrepreneur or young person working in business wanting an idea of the big picture.The book is easily read and flows so quickly with great examples, humor and wit you could find yourself up to the wee hours reading. Actually, I found me self talking with an Irish Brogue by the time I finished it.In my management coaching I not only suggest reading Why America Never Invaded America I require it. Pick up a copy and give yourself a treat. Reading management or business books are seldom both enjoyable and valuable. Why America Never Invaded America is."
3,Better Than No Time To Kill- But Not By Much,"This album has the same commercial feel as No Time To Kill but I think it is a little better as the songs are better written. The best songs here are One Emotion and Life Gets Away. The latter has a similar sound to When My Ship Comes In but isn't as good. Summer's Comin' is an okay beach song but the video was repulsive. Clint's Wife Lisa is among the many celebrites in this video with Joey Lawrence being the most annoying. And who does Clint think he is fooling with ""I Can Get By"" which is a clone of ""Tuckered Out"" from his last album. The closing song, ""You Made Me Feel"" is pretty good but would be considered pop but is a welcome finale to a mediocre album."
4,Good book,Good book I think it covers the basic info you need to run. I place this book second to the book The Ultimate Guide To Winning Elections.
5,Excellent,This rinse aid has a citrus scent and does quite well getting rid of spots. It works well in my Miele dishwasher.
3,Good at measuring,I found the measurements to be pretty accurate but I have a lot of trouble opening and closing it. I end up adding 10 steps just trying to get it open. This is probably because the clasp is all plastic and there are some variaions in the plastic. I hope that after using it a bit the clasp will loosen.
1,Choose a different pedometer,I ordered 24 pedometers for a weight management class that I teach. 3/4 of the pedometers do not work correctly. The majority overestimate steps taken. A few froze and will not work at all. My group is very disappointed in the quality and has requested that I return them. I have used other pedomters in the past for my groups (America on the Move pedometers) and have had no problems.
1,Very Difficult to Open,"I've got blisters on my thumb from trying to open this pedometer.I have suspicions that it isn't really accurate, but I can't tellbecause I can't get the thing open. (I'd like to check it severaltimes a day, but my thumb hurts. Ouch!)"
1,Counted steps when sitting on a table,"This pedometer was horrible, and I returned it to Amazon (which was a painless process, by the way). I noticed a problem when I took off the pedometer and put it on my nightstand at night (and then cleared the steps) - and woke up in the morning to have 100+ steps! The pedometer never moved but steps were added. I counted out my steps on the way to work one morning, and it was off by 20%. Very unreliable product, in my experience at least."
2,Do Not Buy For Improvement,"This is not the best middle game instruction book due to the author's poor teaching skills and baffling statements. He will show you a few moves demonstrating his topic only to top it off by saying things like, ""A simple yet strong move"" only to follow with ""Blacks takes advantage of White's weakening the f4 square"" on Blacks next move. OK-If the simple yet strong move was so strong, please explain it.Why is it so strong when the very next move Black is able to take advantage of it?? Or, ""The dark squares are permanently weakened,enhancing White's dark square Bishop"" yet when Black does a mini combination that trades off this Bishop he says, ""Black's remaining pieces are hopelessly uncoordinated."" If the Bishop reigned supreme how is Black worse off with it gone?Overall, this is a shallow book. It's only good point is that the actual examples are quite interesting to study. Just ignore the author's inane comments."
4,a John Wayne favorite,I always liked this John Wayne movie. It is a little different that the typical fare for him and it makes it more interesting.
3,Not as good a movie 40 years later...,This was one of my mom's favorite movies. She too had left Communist China after the 1949 revolution. One of our customers at our laundry was an extra in the movie. I've always been a big John Wayne fan but this was not one of his best performances. It looked like he was walking through the role. Lauren Bacall could have also given a better performance. Seeing Blood Alley forty years later from the viewpoint of an adult was a little disappointing.
1,not reliable,"Only shows outside temp whenever it feels like it. Remote unit is only 50 feet away and in line of sight,but still dosn't want to work. Outside temp reads 8 to 10 degrees cooler than my other thermometers.Very unhappy with it."
5,easy to set up,and use. Works well. Great value! Does a better job than the more expensive one my daughter has.
1,Negative experience,"NOT SO GOOD TRANSMITTER & RECEIVER WORKED FINE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. THEN TRANSMITTER SHUT DOWN. NEW BATTERY, TWICE, MADE NO DIFFERENCE. UNABLE TO FIND A PATH TO CONTACT AMAZON. DID FIND A PATH AT OREGON SCIENTIFIC WHICH PROMISED A RESPONSE WITHIN 4 DAYS. BEEN 2 WEEKS NOW AND NO RESPONSE FROM THEM. RECEIVER STILL WORKS FINE BUT GIVES ONLY INDOOR TEMP. TRANSMITTER WAS IN SHELTERED SPOT AND SUFFERED NO DAMAGE OTHER THAN ZOMKING OUT.BAD EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH COMPANIES"
1,Doesn't Live up to Promise,"This seemed like a great idea, but then I learned from the instructions that you are not supposed to place the remote unit outdoors in the weather! What good is an outdoor thermometer that can't get rained on? Then, perhaps because I placed it in the weather anyway, the remote unit completely stopped functioning after only a few weeks. A total non-starter iin my opinion."
3,"good, but not great","This CD is worth getting, but don't listen to it too often or it will get boring. Potential for improvement. Great Vocals. Lyrics lyrics and programming good, but repetitive and repetitive style as well"
2,Beautiful vocals don't make up for insipid intrumentation,"I came across this CD by accident and was inspired to listen on by the ethereal quality of the first track. I was increasingly dissapointed by each subsequent song. Depsite Ruth Anns' fabulous vocal quality, the songs were a bit insipid, sounding like a teenager experimenting with a new synthesizer. Olive should maximize its strengths before the next studio effort!"
3,"Three stars, then one, then five...but a solid three.","Born in the 60s, grew up with 70s AM radio, and lived the late 70s/early 80s 'rebellion. Olive really delivers on this CD. When I listen to it, I'm at once yelling at the speakers ""F*ck you"" and grooving. Two of the songs on the CD remind me of mid-80s grrl bands (a la Bananarama and Lucious Jackson), and the rest remind me of Dukkakis-esque poorly written ballads of lesbians stuck in straight marriages. Don't listen to the lyrics, and you have a very fine hip hang-out backtrack, where the beat keeps the velocity of the conversation going. Slow the velocity of the conversation down, and focus on the lyrics, and one might find a veritable made-to-order CNN bloodbath. Men don't fare too well in the lyrics (I should say 'lovers'), but they can get a groove nonetheless. All in all, a fine background CD that should keep the hip in hipster patio parties, and the guests wondering, ""Who is this?""The CD isn't great, but it comes in far above 'sucks.'"
4,"Absolutely radiant, surely to have something for everyone","Olive's lead female singer has a low, mercurial voice that isn't too abrasive, songstress-ish, and is very interesting. The song YOU'RE NOT ALONE has a very, very sensational beat...and mind you, a YOU'RE NOT ALONE remix is a hidden track if you let the 13 min last track play until it reaches about 9 mins--then the fantastic mix begins!This is a great collection of trip hop. TRICKLE is outstanding too, but i'd check out this album first...the outstanding cut on that album is undoubtedly ""I'M NOT IN LOVE"""
4,the samurai in us,"I purchased this item hoping that I would be an extra in the remake of Seven Samurai. Unfortunately my dream is dead. However, the sword, now displayed on a wall in my bedroom, seems to provoke a kind of aggressive wisdom in my spirit. This product is a pleasantry, a kind of artists gift. It seems to compensate for my lack of martial arts ability. The case of the sword is perfect. The blade itself is weak, but it still can provide the illusion of being something majestic. I recommend it to anyone who has a severe lapse of conscious thought. It's a tool that has lost its place in the world. Technology has murdered the grace of the sword. If you're looking for something a little more practical, purchase a pen. Maybe a quill? If not, spend your earnings on a sword, preferably this one."
5,And the rush is on,"This song was one of the very few songs to get my blood pumping, heart racing, and adreanaline rushing. It starts off calm, then the song skyrockets you on a awsome 5 minute+ trip. This is my 3rd favorite song of hers. Right behind To Be and M.As for the remixes, only Dub's remix is worth listening to, but that doesn't bring me the energy bursting experience that the first one did. I mean I gave the remixes a shot, but just like others they just can't match the original.This song is awsome, and it should be one of those songs they ise in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution. If you're a diehard fan of Ayu, you should grab a-hold of this, if not, then you should walk on by and get I am. It has the originial plus some of Ayu's greatest work.peace"
5,"Great remixes, but can't compare with original.","Feels good to be the first to review from the east coast, meaning her music spans many countries, coast to coast, or boarder to boarder. She's very attractive, and a great singer. her voice is stunning, and very addicting in a sense that you just won't get enough of it. Granted, one or two remixes on this cd didn't shoot par, but were good overall. it's good that the original is on here too. that is by far my favorite song...EVER!!! this is the cd for you if you're an Ayu collector, or you love the song."
1,Inexcusable; Brady should be ashamed,"Do not waste your money on this steaming load. Not only is it missing a TON of maps (CoP zones, I can understand.. but no Boyahda, Quicksand, Onzozo, etc.?); for the maps it does have, that's just about all you get - a map. There's a little info on some NM pop locations, but that's it. This guide doles out useful information very sparingly. Not a single damn coffer pop location.As if being an ATLAS WITHOUT MAPS wasn't enough, the guide is spotted with misinformation here and there. For example, don't try to use this guide if you need to go to a specific location in Western Altepa Desert - the grid is completely wrong.The one useful thing you get from this guide is level ranges and aggro information for different mobs in different zones. Knowing whether raptors in the Valley link or not is a good thing.. for this, I give the Brady Atlas 1 star."
3,variable sound quality & volume,"If you want a comprehensive, economical collection of wonderful Disney songs, then this is the set for you. Although I am a Disney music fan, I was disappointed in this collection. First, I was surprised that other reviewers did not mention that the sound quality and volume vary. This problem is annoying to me while listening. Second, the collection contains a number of songs that make good background music for Disney movies but are boring to listen to on their own. Third, the songs seem to occur in a random order. I would have preferred that songs from the same movie be grouped together. Personally, I would have preferred a complete set of ""greatest hits."""
5,A great way to start your Disney music library,"I bought this box set before I acquired any other Disney movie soundtracks. It's a great way to start your collection by getting most of the songs that you would want from many classic Disney movies. It's also nice because it has some songs that are from movies that are not as popular. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and a must have for any Disney fan or any family!"
4,C'est un bon choix à un bon prix,"Comme tout produit Disney, la qualité est bonne. Il y a parfois des variations du niveau d'enregistrement entre différentes pièces mais hormis ce détail, c'est un bel ensemble. Il y a parfois certaines longueurs car certaines pièces contiennent une partie du dialogue du film ou une trop longue introduction musicale, mais cela n'enlève rien à la qualité et à la diversité de cet ensemble. Vous pouvez acheter chacun des 5 CD individuellement mais si vous aimez cette musique, je vous conseille d'acheter l'ensemble qui revient réellement moins cher. Personnellement, je préfère les CD #1 et #2 mais d'autres personnes pourraient préférer le #3, le #4 ou le #5. Comme toutes les pièces sont identifiées, achetez celui qui vous convient."
2,Batteries not easy to find...,"This pedometer requires 3 batteries to operate. It takes 2 LR43 batteries and 1-12 volt battery. It comes with the batteries initially, but the replacement batteries aren't easy to find. I had success at an 'all batteries' store."
1,broken!,Although it kept time (which indicates the batteries were good) this didn't work the first day I used it. It worked the second day. It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost. This was a complete waste of $19.
1,with radio? what a joke!,"This is the second one of these I've owned...my first one the screen went blank after about a month and a half...not an uncommon problem with this, I can see reading the other reviews...But I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular pedometer, so I bought a second one...Big mistake!As far as the radio, what a piece of crap. I live about 20 minuters' drive from downtown Houston...maybe there are too many radio stations around here. It just won't lock on to anything, not even the strongest stations. Tons of static and stations fading in and out. I bought a pedometer with a radio because I wanted a radio while I walked. If you're selling a pedometer with a radio, the radio should work.I would give this 0 stars if I could."
2,Beautiful & Classy Set .....but bad quality,"When I saw this online I loved it. The colors and the nautical theme were what my husband and wanted for our baby boy. However, when I saw the set at Babiesrus I was disappointed. The pattern was very nice but the bumper was so poorly stuffed as well as the comforter. For $199. Nautica should stuff there comforter and bumper with cotton instead of polyester which made this beautiful set feel cheap.I recommend seeing this set in person before purchasing it online."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this game because I was sick of the commercials on Pogo, but this version of Scrabble is almost as frustrating as those commercials. I have now played over 100 games at the ""Smart"" level and it seems that rather than the computer getting more skilled at the higher level, I have been getting more difficult tiles to work with, such as trays full of only vowels or only consonants over and over again, z's, q's and j's at the very end of the game, and never the right combinations to make seven-letter words. In addition, replacing the tiles in the tray doesn't help because the same tiles seem to reappear much too frequently. If you love Scrabble as much as I do, get another version."
1,If you like cartoons.,"Do not buy this book! The subject is hashish oil, and thats fine. And you could problaby produce some fine oil you read this book. But it seems the writer has read ""Cannabis alchemy.."" By D. Gold, and then made into a cartoon. There is so little information in the book, and insted the writer has filled the book with pictures of a mad sicentist.If you want to make hashish oil then buy ""cannabis alchemy"". Here you will find many details and a lot les junk!"
3,living on the edge in NYC a century ago,"Moderately interesting, if rambling and loosely edited, recounting of socially marginal individuals of various descriptions; I'd recommend ""Five Points"" instead"
1,"wrong product, you send smoke, i buy clear","Please note that the picture of this item its wrong, you are showing a clear lights and the one i was thinking.instead I find a very dark cristals,maybe its my mistake for not seen the word smoke.....the picture confuse me.Send me the clearones PLEASE !!!! i dont have money to bay them again..."
1,Photos were lacking,"I was a little disappointed in the that the book has no photographs of the cockpit of a C-5 yet, the author did manage to get cockpit photos of a C-141 and a Russian An-124! Also, I would have expected some photos of the plane under construction. There were none of those. There weren't any photos of the troop compartment and not very many photos of the cargo compartment or of anything being loaded onto the aircraft. In fact, a lot of the photos appear to have been taken at airshows!"
4,just good music,"Every week I visit this site to see, if there is a cheap ""the lost weekend"" cd. And so I see also every week the real bad review of ""cast iron soul"". Sure, ""cast iron soul"" is no second ""lost weekend"", but it's a great cd from two great musicians! Steve Wynn and Dan Stuart! It's a fine combination between straight rockers, easy going country songs and some darker material - just good music!p.s. I hope my english was good enough..."
3,Lower quality but better than nothing.,"These do fit my older Electrolux model vacuum. However, I still had one of the original Electolux filters and in comparison, these are of relatively low quality. They are thin and do no have the same high density of fibers as does the Electrolux one. I'm sure they're better than nothing, but I'm going to keep trying to find some Electrolux ones."
5,Makes muscles happy!,"This is GREAT for preventing injury and rolling out sore or tight muscles. I prefer it over ""The Stick"" because it won't pinch and it feels better on the skin. I highly recommend the Tiger Tail!"
2,Adventures In Boogabooga Land,"I watched this dvd with my 6-year-old son. He was not impressed with the music. He said he didn't like it. I asked what he would do to make it better and he suggested Tony Hawk. He did laugh a few times, such as when the monkey was on fire or when the squid was stuck to the monkey's face. I also let the movie keep running after the first time through and he did continue to watch it. But I don't believe that this will be one of his favorites. I do happen to know the third parable that the dvd was based on and it is a good idea in theory. I just don't think that it did enough to relate to the Bible. If there had been a better explanation of the Bible verses, it might have been better. I think it seemed more like 3 random cartoons put together."
5,Incredibly Helpful!,"Some friends of mine gave me an older parrot(about 20 yrs). I had been told he was not stick or hand trained. The first two weeks, my hands were shredded. Then I saw this book and thought I'd try it (after all, I only had a few fingers left to lose). The book taught me how to approach the bird, how to use ""body language"" to communicate with him, and what to avoid doing. I put the information into practice right away and what a difference it made! I couldn't believe it! He acted like a completely different bird. I am still getting bitten, but only occasionally. I would recommend this book to anyone. I can't say enough about it. It works miracles!"
5,Wonderful book,This is an excellent book. The anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides. The authors book on Senegal parrots and their family is also full of information.
5,Great Book!!,I got this book as a part of my research when I was collecting information on Greys. I wanted it for a reference so I wouldn't do anything wrong with my Timneh. I wanted to make sure I made her happy and well adjusted. This is a great book for that. Mattie Sue knows her birds.
5,How can any young dinosaur-lover not like it?,"In typical Melissa and Doug quality, this set is solidly and well made. It contains everything that a young dinosaur-lover would want - cool stamps and colored pencils to color them in. Who can't love that? I would highly recommend it!"
5,Love this show. British comedy at its very best.,"I use to watch this show on tv,but happily I found it on here to watch. It's very dry type of humor & love it."
1,Defective product,Received this coffee pot in December and the bottom has rusted out and it will no longer hold water. We set full of water on the stove ready to turn on in the morning and it was empty when we tried to make coffee in the morning.
2,useless!,A book not good enough for beginners ...really more of a how-to-paint magazine lacking actual info on how to paint...better to study masters and take classes
4,A historic release,"After releasing this material in haphazard fashion over the years, BMG/RCA finally put this 2 disc set out containing all of Dizzy's recordings for the RCA label. In essence, this showcases Dizzy's dream of uniting bop and big-band music. There are some outstanding tracks here, notably ""A Night in Tunisia,"" ""Two Bass Hit,"" ""Cubana Bop,"" and ""Dizzier and Dizzier."" Ballads such as ""You Go to My Head"" are handled tenderly. However, I found novelty numbers like ""Hey Pete Let's Eat More Meat"" a waste of time. But, warts and all, having these complete recordings is a welcome addition to the jazz catalog."
5,Delightful reference book,"I got the last copy in the store and all others will just have to go wanting! I spent hours searching for an herb book that would fullfill all my interests and questions on general herb usuage and this book is it. I keep it in the ""library"", that's how good it is!!"
1,"Copy ""Controlled"" CD","This EMI CD displayed the following message when I tried to copy it to the music library on my harddisk:""To listen to the CD a number of files need to be updated on your PC.""From the research I was able to do on the Internet, this is a rootkit which is attempting to install. It is what Sony got in trouble for at one time.I have other EMI CD's which did not do this. To anyone posting products on any Web site, please be sure you identify this issue when it applies to your CD."
2,Making the Simple Seem Complicated,"This is essentially an exploration of the circumstances surrounding the government crackdown on the Falun Gong craze that swept Red China in the 1990's. Unfortunately, this wasn't clear until the end of the book. This book might be interesting to an anthropologist accustomed to dense writing but I don't think it's very useful, or interesting, to the non-scholar."
4,Breathing spaces,Breathing spaces by Nancy N. Chen shows a good connection between psychiatry and Qigong. It gives a rare insight to the non-Chinese practizing qigong and psychiatry.Aliza
4,a lovely floral bouquet,"Imagination and innovation are hallmarks of designer Issye Miyake. Born in Hiroshima where he was a student of graphic design (think his ""Pleats Please"" line), he later moved to Paris where he worked for Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy.In the late 1960s he moved to New York and the salon of Geoffrey Beene. Just a short jump from there to opening his own studio two years later. The rest is couture history and today his clothing is worn by the very fashionable.Miyake brought the same exuberance to the creation of his fragrance that he brought to his designs. While it is a floral essence, it is enhanced with a variety of flower scents: lotus, cyclamen, freesia, carnations, white lilies. Base notes are sandalwood, moss and cedar.It's a delightful fragrance for women of all ages."
3,Would be 5 stars if reasonably priced,"These are well-engineered for exactly what they do. But come on, it's a folded piece of steel and some plastic! I got an extra set so I could mount my thickness planer to the DW723 miter saw stand. Works well for that purpose, and I may do the same for a couple of other benchtop tools."
2,Previous back clamps were a much better design,"You'll be disappointed with this newly designed level clamp. It is difficult to place on the table and more difficult to remove the saw from the table with the 2 or 3 point levers. The previous set I have, (note same model), lock on much better with the old style levers. It works fine if you're going to leave the saw on the table though I bought the removable ones so I wouldn't have to."
3,Missing something...,"Well, the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack does indeed have some interseting music on it...but the fact is it is missing one minor detail...THE MAIN TITLE...which happens to be the reason I bought the friggin' thing. I gave this only three stars becuase it is missing the one song I wanted but the other tracks on it are somewhat entertaining and very interesting."
5,Answer to the Review about the title of the Song,The title of the song that is played when Lloyd is walking down the street is called Red Right Hands by Nick Cave.
3,Mary Moon,"Great Soundtrack but missing a few songs as stated earlier. Especially, Mary Moon!! But I suppose you can't have everything."
1,Problem with sale not with product,I added this item to my cart twice and even checked out because I wanted to give one as a Christmas gift. I have one that I bought last year and love it. Every time I tried to pay for it I got charged the original price and not the special sale price. I even checked out all the way but ended up having to cancel my order because it never corrected the price.
4,Nice Product for the Price,"I got this product on special and absolutely love the Foil Cutter and Wine opener part of it. The wine chiller is currently serving as my utensil holder on my counter-top however, so that was a refreshing bonus. I thought it didnt work at first because I kept pre-maturely releasing the ""Down"" button, just be sure to press ""Down"" until the Opener stops the cycle or else you will just remove the corkscrew without the cork attached. The Foil Cutter fits nicely on to the back of the charger and is simple to use. I think that for the money this product is well worth it."
4,Oster Wine Opener,"It worked perfectly after we got the hang of depressing the ""open"" button until the mechanism stopped completely. The foil cutter and opener make uncorking wine a much easier and enjoyable experience than the old ""screw and pull"" corkscrew method."
5,wine opener,These wine opener was great. It opens the wine really easier and its also a really great gift to give to someone.
4,....eh,"This is actually two pieces. You get the wine opener and the wine chiller.The wine chiller isn't really anything special. It looks pretty but we never use it.The wine opener is pretty neat. We have used that and it defiantly opens the wine. Which for someone that for some reason has issues with corks, is fabulous.I wish we used it more, but in all honesty, we don't."
4,Nice idea!,I like this a lot...my hubby got it for me and I liked it so I got my cousin one for Christmas. It is a little strange to get to work right but other than that it's a great buy and a nice treat to opening wine for wine lovers. I just wanted it to show off... haha:)
3,Secret Santa,I love the price and the idea of this product. I think it could be a little more user friendly. You have to pull up on the whole device and cork to get it out. Wish it would just bring it out for you. Other than that my friend loves it.
4,Pricing,"The product was a gift for my son. He loves it. My only complaint is that while I had the product in my cart waiting to get my son's address, the price went up. It would be nice if they honored the original price, but I ended up paying more. Unfortunately, I think this is an Amazon problem. :("
4,I LOVE IT I LOVE IT,LOVE RICK SPRINGFIELD AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I LOVE THOSE CHESSY 80'S MOVIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU
3,Rick's Best Flicks,"Romantic and fun. It kept me watching with my jaw dropped. Rick Springfield did it all. I loved it, loved it, loved it. A must see for Springfield fan's."
2,Mobb Deep is NOT even close to bein one of tha best,"Mobb Deep has sum good songs but only a few.Their stylez borin,I dont need Mobb Deep 2 tell me shit thass goin down, if I wanna know, I'll juss open up tha door..is that tha only thang they can flow about??If u want a TIIIIGHT cd...go buy Makaveli,E. 1999 Eternal,Creepin On Ah Comeup,or Guerilla Warefare. (dont look under mobb deep)"
4,A great single...,"""Tonight, Tonight"" is of course a great song, and its accompanying b-sides mix very well with it. These are all pretty good songs, and are mostly laid-back. ""Rotten Apples"" is a nice little sleepy song, and my favorite of the original b-sides. ""Tonite Reprise"" is the biggest reason to buy this single (make sure the version of the single you're buying has this song on it!). It's a beautiful acoustic version of the a-side with a slightly different lyrical arrangement.The singles from Mellon Collie all had great b-sides included on them (except 1979), and this is one of the better collections."
1,A lot about everything but the crimes,"I tried but could not read past the first half of this book. Pages and pages are dedicated to the history of the rubber industry, the creation of the beer industry, the childhoods of people who eventually had buildings or streets named after them... but very little about Dahmer's crimes. When the book finally starts discussing the killings, each victim gets about a paragraph of text. The writing is poor, and it reads more like a history paper and a discussion of current world events, with a few blurbs about the murders thrown in. This book is not recommended."
2,"Informative, but poorly written.","This book has a lot of information about Dahmer's childhood, his early adult life, and his life as a serial killer. It also describes in detail his apartment, where he commited most of his murders, as well as his mode of killing. There are very brief descriptions about each of his victims, and how Dahmer met them and killed them. These descriptions are boring, and perhaps that is somewhat to be expected since Dahmer's method was so formulaic.However, I was surprised by how poorly written this book is. It is filled with repetitive descriptions, stupid metaphors, and generally awkward sentences. Also, I was surprised that there was not more of an attempt to understand the man and his motivations. There is an interview with a psychiatrist, but it barely scratched the surface of Dahmer's psyche, and also roamed quite far off topic.In summary, I read plenty of information about the man and his crimes, but doing so was not a pleasure."
1,UGH,Very boring! Was more concerned with what was going on during the time Jeffrey Dahmer was committing the crimes than with Jeffrey Dahmer himself. I feel this book was more of a history lesson on Milwaukee than a true crime book about Dahmer. I am VERY disappointed. Horrible horrible reading.....had to force myself to finish it. Who'd have ever thought that a book on Dahmer could be so boring??
2,Hard to read!,"I`m Swedish and doesn't really have a hard time reading books in english.. but this one uses many words i don`t recognize and the author jumps back and forth in time!I find myself having a hard time in concentrating on the book, and i wonder if it really is necessary to describe so much environment and other happenings that i have a hard time find is relevant to this book!I get a bit confused when the author jumps back and forth in time, i don't get any good grip of the handling."
1,I had the same problem,"This is my first vacuum.But it is like a nightmare.For the first use, it is hard for me to put the dust bin back.For the second use, the belt burned really bad without any excessive slippage.It is just terrible.I am returning it."
2,Belt keeps breaking. Vacuum works OK.,"Pathetic reliabilty with regards to the belt. Engine runs hot. I don't know if this is the reason the belt keeps on breaking. Replaced 3 belts in last 6 months of service. I don't know if there is any explanation to this. Put your money some place else.Regards,"
2,Not what we had hoped for,"With various Panasonic and Amazon rebates, we were able to get this vacuum for a great price.It seemed to work well at first, picking up a lot of dirt and hair (the dog & cat shed like crazy) from the carpets. The first issue we noted was that it was difficult to empty the canister, as the dirt & hair would wedge itself between the filter & the cansiter. It was a pain to get out, dust would get everywhere.Then the vacuum started throwing the belt, eventually it would come off every couple minutes. We had purchased a couple replacement belts, but they did the same thing as well.So, we made the decision to return it. Kudos to Amazon for making the return experience a pleasant one. Ended up buying a cheap Eureka 5550A model, which has worked much better for us."
4,Good vacuum at cheap price,I got this vacuum at less than $80 with several promotion during last winter. This vacuum sucks much better than my previous ureka bagles vacuum. Hepa filter makes me feel comfortable during vacuuming. Dual sweep system really works well. My dust cup also fits well everytime. Convenient light at the bottom enlightens even dark corners and closet in the room.The only con is that it is a little bit hard to empty dust cup. But this would be common problem of all bagless vacuum.
1,Pure Fluff...*puke*,Ok...this label really is putting out some of the fluffiest music in new age/chillout. I think they should stick with the new age stuff like garden of serenity and chakra in my back pocket. Please stop putting out wallpaper music...
5,Sony MDR-EX81LP earbuds,Use them almost every day have been working out even better than I thought they would. I use them with a Sony Walkman am fm radio and they actually make the radio sound better. I use them while walking through the city and while at work and they block out interfering noise very well.
2,uncomfortable,I purchased these earphones mainly to use when working out. They were uncomfortable in my ears and kept falling out while running (even trying the different sized foam inserts). I would not purchase this item again.
1,horrible product,i expect better than this from sony. i realize they are earphones i just didn't think that meant i would have to insert them into my ear canal just to get half decent sound from them. a truly craptacular product. i used them once and now they are in the trash.
2,Wade Asher,"The sound quality is alright, but the volume is too low, I can hear my cheap one better. I'm sure they did that to, protect your ears. When I'm mowing grass I need more volume. They are very comfortable. For the money I should be able to hear them better, I'm using my cheap ones the most!"
2,No bass but do stay in place...,"I as well was looking for a quality pair of in ear-bud headphones. I found these Sony's and thought they would be the ones. After payin $40 and using them in the gym, I found out that the junk creative headphones that originally came with my MP3 player delivered better base as well as quality sound..The only problem is that they do not stay in my ears..Hence the entire reason I bought the Sony's.. I'm still looking for good base and loud volume for a decent price..."
1,Decent until they break,"Originally I would rate these a 3-4 star product. They sound was an incredible step up from the default Ipod headphones. The fit wasn't perfect, but they needed less adjusting while I was working out than most other earbuds. About 3 months after I bought them the left earbud stopped working. No sound at all. The warranty process was painless as Sony sent me a new, not refurbished, pair. After 6 months the 2nd pair had the same problem happen. The left earbud went out. I'll be looking elsewhere for a new pair of headphones."
2,Just OK,"I am disappointed after having listened to these Sony earbuds for a while. Very little (if any) bass response and the mid-range seems a bit flat also. It is possible that I have not yet found a proper fit in my ear to experience all these have to offer but so far, I get better sound out of my $10 Seinheissers. If you decide to buy these make an effort to go to a local retailer and listen to them first."
2,Not for you athletes,"These earphones have pretty good sound, and 3 sizes of buds to adjust fit to your inner ear, but they do not fit the outer ear snugly enough to not bounce up and down annoyingly when running, jumping rope, etc...which is exactly why I was looking for this style--something to fit the ear snugly and securely during activities. The result is they may move around enough on your ears to actually fall off during vigorous exercise, as is the case with me. I have ""normal"" size ears for a 6'2"" man, so I don't think it's a sizing thing. Probably fine if you never get past walking."
1,Not as good as I thought it would be,I just ordered these and got them in the mail and tryed them out. While I was jogging they would just not stay over my ears they kept falling off. They seem like they should be used for just walking use. I guess they work better with people with larger ears. I tryed using the ajustments that came with it and it still didn't fix the problem. So take it from me buy something better you would be alot happier.
2,Not good for running,These refuse to stay in your ears while running. They even fall out on an elliptical machine. Sound is good- if you can get a good fit. I would suggest looking for some earbuds that fit tightly inside the ear canal.
5,Great set of earphones!,"I'm really enjoying my new Sony earplugs! They work great, stay on my ears at the gym and sound out of this world! Lots of highs and lows, very pleased!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about these... Admittedly, I'm not a headphone expert, but I do go through (meaning lose) quite a few lower-end sets each year at the gym.First, the sound of these is very good for the price.Fitment, however is iffy. Between the earpiece not fitting exactly right, and the post extending upwards from the earpiece, these just won't stay in my ears if I'm moving around. Running??? forgettaboutit ;)I suppose I'll relegate these to office use and go in search of something else for the gym."
1,"Sound great, then fall apart","UPDATE: Six months after my last review, and after Sony sent me a replacement for the last earbuds whose wires became exposed, the right ear on my new earphones died. Because my two previous Sony earphones were fragile, I only wore this pair at work and never put them in my pocket or looked at them with malice. They sounded great for a while, but then gradually got quieter and, now, monural. If two to six months is a good life span for earphones, these are for you.As noted in other reviews, these earphones sound really good, but the cord starts to disintegrate after a month. My first pair were white, and when they fell apart, I returned them to Target. I hoped that the problem effected only the white earphones, so I bought a black set in Nov. 2005. By the end of Jan. 2006, the wires became exposed as the rubber-ish coating fell apart. I'm sending them back to Sony for replacements, but I would rather have bought a set of earphones that would last longer than eight weeks."
2,Pretty poor all around,"The only good thing about these earphones are the actual buds that go into your ear. They are comfortable. On the other hand, I don't see how the wraps fit anyone's ears. I have pretty big ears and they are still quite loose on me. The sound is very poor. If you like earphones that lack bass, then these are for you. My iPod earphones blow these things out of the water. This is my first review. I usually don't like wasting my time writing reviews, but I just couldn't resist on this one."
2,Poor sound quality and Bud-style isn't exactly fitting.,"The sound is WAY too soft. I understand that it might be Sony's intention since it does drown out the ambient noise and there is no need for turning it too loud to listen to the music, but I wish it had a bit more power in the lower frequency and a bit LOUDER.Despite it being the ear-bud style earphones, the wrap-around-your-ear loop isn't a customizeable fit. Unless you have huge ears they tend to slip off around your ear. It would have been better if the loop was adjustable. The earpiece turns at maybe 2-degrees for fit into your ears a bit better, but I'm not sure if the product was made that way intentionally or if I just have strong grip of things. It's okay for the price on Amazon.com."
2,bad fitting earbuds,"The earbuds sound pretty good but they do not fit snugly over the top of the ear, unless I guess, you have really large ears."
1,Not for small ears!,"These are supposed to be good-fit earphones, but between sweating and having small ears, they don't fit at all. Not a good choice for the gym, or indeed if you are moving around at all. A real disappointment."
1,Second pair of defective MDREX81LP headphones - Thanks SONY!,"There are two good reasons NOT to buy these headphones: 1) they may very well fail without cause, as two pairs I've own have failed; and 2) SONY is so contemptuous of their customers that they offer to replace your defective $30 headphones with a `reconditioned' pair for $25. What a deal!Do yourself a favor before buying: consider my experience with SONY repair. I mailed in my bum buds - the second pair that failed - but I objected to SONY's pricing. Surely they have a better deal to offer? Nope. SONY shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap. Oh - and they invited me to get back to them: ""It would be our pleasure to accept a major credit card.""I bet: $25 for used headphones with no cut to the retail middleman. This is SONY standing behind its product. ""You're on your own, sucker."""
3,Handle with care,"Like many others can attest to, these headphones sound great. My first time putting them in I was truly amazed, I felt like the music was being played in my head versus just streaming in from my ears.Be warned, however, these things are flimsy! The cord is very thin and where it connects to the plastic piece it started coming apart and exposing the copper wire underneath. It's rubberrized texture doesn't help the cause either. Additionally, the odd shape of these headphones makes these very difficult to simply wrap around your MP3 player and stow in your pocket. And lastly, those silicon end pieces can fall off while you're pulling the headphones out of your pocket and they're absurdly expensive to replace (I paid $11 after shipping to Sony for one piece!).Bottom line: great sound, but don't wrap them around your MP3 player and stow in your pocket as they'll fall apart. In other words, handle with care."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this headset few days ego. I was expecting something similar to Shure e2c which I already own, hoping for some noise blocking ability for lesser price. Unfortunately I did not get what I wanted. Although, these go in your ear similarly to shure ear buds, the rubber material making up the tips is very soft and thin and offers almost no noise blocking. The headset itself feels very fragile and cheap. I wish I just spent another 30 bucks and bought another pair of Shure e2c's, which are very well made and are great for the loud environments. One positive thing I can say about them is that the sound quality is OK."
4,Second time around,"This is the second pair I have owned. The sound is quite good for the money.They stay in my ears no matter how active I am.The reason I had to purchase another pair is that the case that they come pinched the wire and caused them not to work.I am going to purchase the same pair without the ""hooks"" over the ears. Although they are perfectly comfortable they are inconvenient to stow because the hooks catch everything and they still would stay in your ears when not exercising."
2,Nice Sound but poor cord quality,"I just looked up my order for these and I can't believe I bought these in September of 2005. Why? Well Even though its april of 2006 I retired these in March of 2006 because the wire casing dissolvd exposing the copper wire and such...I mean it looks so ghetto...what a rip. Don't get me wrong the sound quality is pretty good and they do a good job of blocking out noise, but I only used these when I commuted not even outdoors and such so for the wires to be exposed after six months is quite ridiculous! Good luck!"
2,Several Problems,"First of all, if you have small ears, the ear loops will not fit comfortably. The headphones are effectively being held up by the earbud inside your ear, with the loops sticking up above your ear.Secondly, static electricity problems. I wore these while at work, on a carpeted floor - I got shocked a lot, and it is VERY unpleasant to be shocked in your ear.Third, sound quality. I'm not an audiophile or anything, but there's kind of a staticky background noise at all times. And when listening to podcasts, whenever someone says something with the ""s"" sound it's screechy and very painful for the ears.On the plus side, they look pretty cool. Other than that, I can't recommend these headphones."
4,Concerns about lead in hoses,"I wanted to buy a lead free hose for the garden and pool, this one is manufactured as 'drinkable', and it does its job."
3,Could be sturdier,"We use a drinking water hose to fill up our fresh water tank on our boat. It's also safer for the kids to drink out of. It offers a clean taste without the usual ""garden hose"" taste and offers no chemical leaching. I used to be able to pick up very sturdy drinking/garden hoses from our local hardware stores, but they are no longer available. I can't even find any online anymore. They were much more rugged than this hose. They were light green in color and very sturdy. Our new hose doubles as the garden hose and when a lot of pressure is put on it, such as when using a lawn sprinkler, a hand held sprayer or when it's hooked up to our power washer, it bulges quite a bit. I don't know how long it will last. It feels flimsy and kinks easily even though it states that it doesn't. It's not a bad hose, I just don't think it will last that long. I wish they would make a stronger drinking hose available instead of these little wimpy ones."
3,Great Brando.,"I would love to see this movie again and own it.I saw it years ago as a kid.I loved the part when brando knocks over the beer bottle by accident, and then finishes the scene. Lower the price by 70.00 dollars and I will buy it."
5,A Fun Book to Read,"This is a fun book to read. Though entertaining, it is also educational and will serve you well when you are ready to invest in stocks. In fact, it is packed with important information that is easily assimilated. This book is so interesting that my spouse read it and became interested in the investment process. This has saved me hours in trying to explain how the market worksStrongly recommed this book for family reading. Especially if you have children in high school,college or just entering the work force. A terrific book to take on vacation and read while in the air, at the beach or on ship board."
5,Mittel-Europische Sparkle and Sheen,"Kohaut, a Haydn contemporary from Vienna, was unknown to me before I heard this disc, but I'd love to hear more of this fresh, crisp and inventive style. The six works here, five of them billed as lute concertos, come through to me as elegant chamber music that no doubt features the lute (Kohaut's own instrument), but gives the three string players plenty of chances to shine.All credit is due to the crack California ensemble (lutenist John Scneiderman, cellist William Skeen and violinists Elizabeth Blumenstock and Lisa Weiss) who play with true Mittel-Europische sparkle and sheen, and to the technical team that has provided them with just the right sharp and clear acoustic. Bring on more Kohaut!"
1,Not recommended for anyone who has pets.,I purchased this vacuum for my daughter for Christmas. She has a golden retriever and this vacuum was recommended by several amazon customers. Based on their positive report I purchased the vacuum thinking our pet-hair problem was solved. The belt broke during the first use. I had it repaired and she used it twice when the belt broke again. If you have pets I would not recommend purchasing this vacuum. I now use it to vacuum the basement and it works okay.K. Veronda
1,Where's the Art?,"How could you write a book about the anime art of Hayao Miyazaki without one single illustration??? Someone else mentioned a DVD, but there's no DVD with my book."
5,Absolutely the finest funk-jazz.,I recall when this was released in the 80s. We listened to it constantly. It's a shame it goes so unappreciated and is so hard to find at a decent price.
4,Not bad,"I'm not a big fan of this movie. I bought it from Amazon because I thought Marisa Tomei was the star. I was wrong. I thought this was a love story. It's not. I was disappointed with this movie because it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. But besides that, this movie was ok. It wasn't boring, but it isn't one of my fav's."
3,type WAY TOO SMALL,"not is the font way too small, but the cryptoquips are written very close to each other. If you make even one mistake, your paper will be so cluttered you wont' be able to finish working it. Someone who doesn't have experience working cryptoquips obviously published/printed this thing!"
3,For the cat lover,"If your toddler or preschooler is a cat lover, this a short, charming story. Cookie is a naughty cat making a mess all week long. On Sunday Cookie rests or does he?"
5,Great Piece of Baby Gear,I have a baby that can not regulate her body heat properly so we have to go for walks in the early morning or early evening during the summer. Unfortunately at this time the sun is very low in the sky so there is a problem with it shining directly in her eyes if we are walking towards the sun. This sun shade is awesome in that it can fold entirely down when the sun is so low that the visor part is too high to block the sun. I highly recommend this product. It is not at all difficult to attach and folds up well.
2,Disappointed,"This is a beautiful cake stand. Made well and sturdy.....HOWEVER, after assembling, I noticed that the top tier metal is bent....and through no fault of my own. I just screwed it into place.....fortunately, I will be able to return it in time for them to replace it prior to the big event."
1,Teresa W. Edwards,"As soon as the roaster was plugged in, there was a strong electrical smell, and the cord was very hot to the touch within just a moment. We were not able to use the roaster at all."
1,pathetic packing for a great product,"The roaster is a wonderful product that I own, therefore I ordered it as a gift. The way it was shipped, however was terrible. The carton it was in was way too large and not properly cushioned. The box that contained the roaster was very badly abused. It looked as if it had been sold previously and retaped. The box was also badly scraped and scratched. Fortunately I was able to retape it and the contents didn't appear to be damaged. I reported this to customer service and John was very sympathetic but could do much else since I needed this gift and had no time to send it back. I would hope in the future that Amazon improves it's packing by training the packers and making sure that they use their new found skills."
1,zero bass,"I'm very dissapointed on regard this headphones. For the price, brand and aspect I expected a great sound. None of the above, the sound is bright in excess an you won't hear any bass. Is unpleasant. I tried different ways to insert them in my ears and no change, changed the plastic cups and nothig, readed and search in the instructions -which are just a few lines- and nothing, looked at te web and no more info. Conclusion, if there is no info, there is no answer. I wasted my time and my money. You know it, now is your call."
2,No need of ear hanger,"I like the color and sony's technology of the earphone itself.But the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless.When I put the earphone in the ears, the hanger part is just hanging in the air, not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady.Because of that, the earphones easily pop out of your ear."
2,over-the ear hook is bad,"If you're the kind of user who can always carry the (included) carrying case, then my comment will be irrelevant; enjoy the earphones, as they're as good as EX71.However, I usually keep my earphones wrapped around my iPod, and unless you are super careful, the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles. The same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle.Also, the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while I use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses. It's doable, but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears.Finally, the white color goes well with the white iPod models, but after a few months, they tend to show the grime all too well.My advice: I don't think that any (claimed) audio improvement over EX-71 is worth the extra hassle. If your heart is set on this model, get the black one."
2,Ear Pieces,The headphones have good sound and the buds themselves fit into the ear well. The problem is with the ear pieces that fit over the ears. They fit either my wife or me. They evidently were designed by an engineer with big ears.
3,if it fits...,"As far as sound quality goes, these headphones exceed the poor sound reproduction of music downloaded off of iTunes. The biggest issue for these headphones is fit. If your head is large enough, the Sony's are a match made in heaven (probably). I am a thin 5' 9"" male and the clips on these headphones are far too big to even consider wearing while running. I recommend spending the extra cash and purchasing these locally for an easy return option, I didn't and now I have to pay shipping twice."
1,Don't be fooled by the other positive reviews...,"This is the worst earphone pictures I have made. I usually don't write reviews, but felt the overwhelming need to write this one. After reading so many positive reviews about these earphones, I decided to pull the trigger and buy it. The sound is okay, but it was like hell trying to get these to stay in your ears without sticking all the way in your ear drum. Get the standard earphones without the loop, it will be much better!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I picked this headset over many other options for the price and comfortable, secure fit they advertise along with ""premium sound and superior bass""If you like listening to all your music filtered through a tin can - these are for you.there is little to NO bass and the earbuds fallout with great ease. Makes for a great time at the gym if you like messing with your overpriced headset and not working out... DO NOT BUY and if you do want to buy them - you can have mine since i can't return them now...."
2,TOO BIG,"I played around with these headphones as soon as I received them and soon realized that the aluminum shaft between the ear piece and the speaker was much too long. The bud itself fits into my ear just fine and I can see how they would be useful in the gym, the very reason I picked them up. If I wear them as they were intended, inside the ear canal, then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose. I played around with them and realized this problem could easily be fixed with a shorter shaft about half the size. If you have large ears these would fit and feel great. I consider my ears average, in no way are they small. The speaker is remotely adjustable swivling a tiny, tiny bit. Bottom line these ear phones would be great if they had about five more ways to adjust them."
5,Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style Stereo Earphones (White),They are very decent ear phones. They may be a little large in the center for some ears. They sound very good.
1,Very disappointing,"First, I bought these because I HATE earbuds inserted into my ear, so I thought the over the ear feature would be great. However, the sound quality from these is very weak. The stock iPod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound. To get any usable sound, I have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible, which is exactly what I hate. Even then, the sound is hollow and tinny.Second, the over the ear feature doesn't work for snot. I cannot get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time. Plus, this is a non-adjustable element. I think my ears are a pretty average size and shape, but I can't use them. I guess it doesn't matter anyhow, since the sound quality is so poor.The carrying case is a nice touch, but about twice as large as it should be."
1,Worse sounding earphones of all time,I did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews on these earphones. When I took them out of the box and tried them with my IPOD I could barely hear anything unless I turned the IPOD volume 3/4 up. I have to believe they sent me damaged merchandise because these were the worse sounding earphones of all time. I immediately sent them back and opted to just stay with my basic IPOD phones which seemed 5 star compared to the MDR-EX81LPs.
2,One Major Flaw,"Indeed the sound quality on these is excellent. But I am on my second pair, namely because of the cord attached to the right earphone. After a few months it loosens and inexplicably develops a 'putty' like quality which soon peels away from the inner wire. Sony should have fixed this issue long ago."
3,Too big,The product is ok but is a little large for my ears and slightly uncomfortable. the covers come off to easily. This is a mediocre product. good sound quality though.
1,Not for me,"No matter how much or little I put on, I don't feel anything but my pain. It does smell. I sprained my back a few days ago and my husband let me use his ActivOn. He warned me that it gets really cold then really hot and I didn't feel it. He claims it works for him, but I still have the full blown pain that I had before applying it directly where it hurt. I guess it isn't for everyone."
5,Awesome!,"These things are great. Used them to mount a coal shovel in my trunk for messy winter plow-ins. They are heavy duty rubber, easily hold the weight of the shovel mounted upside down, with the opening facing down (the worst loading scenario). Easily installed with #10 self-tapping screws (bought at lowes)."
5,solid mount,"Soild molded tool mount. Easy to mount with one bolt each, holds any handled tool IE axe or Shovel or Hi-lift jack. nothing has move even when out on the trail. Nice easy to use mounts."
2,Not the best for AGM,"Purchased to keep Odyssey batteries (AGM) topped off due to infrequent use. The marketing materials suggest the charger works well with AGM batterys, however I don't see that. It would appear the unit is a bit conservative, as it goes in to monitoring mode well before battery is fully charged. An Odyssey battery that has been rested for a while should show 12.8v or higher volts when at room temperature and fully charged. The charger went into monitoring suggesting full charge, so I removed the charger and found only 12.5v. If I had rested the battery, it would have been even lower, so I'm concluding that this charger could be good for only preventing deep discharge, which is not a big worry with AGMs anyway, so for me this charger has very limited value."
4,"small, dependable & powerful","Excellent choice for keeping the battery on my home generator always ready to turn it over. Works too for motorcycle battery stored for the winter, snowblower batteries that lag in cold weather stay up easily. Has a long cord which is very useful in keeping items plugged in but stored out of the way and some distance from the nearest plug. Status lights are clearly visible from a distance and easy to understand. Would have liked to see some kind of clips included to affix wire to pipe or wall or shelf etc.. I used velcro straps and they are just fine."
4,Satisfied,This unit maintains charge on a gel cell battery that supplies my marine radio. It appears to avoid the overcharge problem that I had experienced with an ordinary 12 volt power supply. I am pleased with the unit and the optional connectors.
4,Works as expected,Keeps your battery fully charged while an LED indicates when the charging is occurring. Cheapest charger I found.
5,"Great item,great price","This tender works like a champ,the convenience of the battery terminal adapter is ideal so that I do not have to remove my motorcycle fairing to use the clips."
5,Great,I used to have problems with the battery draining on my motorcycle but once I installed this item the battery face charge at all times
4,Power wher/when you need it,"Small package, great for storing your vehicle for long periods of time; priced right too. Recommended to us by motorcycle owners who have three of them."
2,Tender didn't work for long,I put the tender on my bike and leave it. When I go back to check on it it doesn't seem to be working.
4,Battery Tender,Easy to open. Easy to set up. Would like the portion of the cord that attches to the battery to be longer. Not a deal breaker. Plan to buy at least one more.
4,Plugs directly into outlet - no cord,"I ordered this through Amazon, without having seen/touched the product. Although the photo and description are true and accurate, I failed to notice there is no electrical power cord to the outlet. The unit plugs directly into the outlet, unlike the large Battery Tender I own.I own more vehicles than I can use, regularly. When I require the specialized use of a vehicle which has not been started in two weeks, I want the ignition to have full battery power. Battery Tenders are on three of my motorized vehicles. They work!"
5,Satisfied,"The Battery Tender Junior was delivered as promised. I installed the pigtail attachment to my 2000 Wide Glide and the plug tucks away nicely behind the battery. I use the alligator attachment on my other motorcycle and lawn tractor. I have used both attachments twice and they work as advertised. The junior does take longer to initially charge a weak battery but if you have the time, it is the best deal for the price."
2,Worked well at first,"I bought this one because I lost my first one. I used the Balck and decker model and decided to try this brand. MISTAKE.It worked well at first, but when I decided to use it a few months later to trickle charge my motorcycle battery, it wouldnt charge.I checked the fuse: GOODthe electrical power point: GOODI think the transformer inside the box some how burned out.Good: I like that it came with the different wiresBad: i used it 1x and it burned out some how.So, I bought another Black and Decker."
5,great product,perfect operatin battery tender has always been my favorite small battery chargerI have it on all my motorcycles and watercraft
4,Awesome,Well I had to buy something to keep the battery on my motorcycle charged and this seemed like the best thing I could find. I plugged this in the night I got it and the went out to the garage the next day to see if I could start the bike and presto! It started right up. The price was better than anywhere I had looked and I even ordered the carrying case for it so I could take advantage of the free shipping for cheaper than I could have bought only this. $33 bucks! My brother was so impressed he had me order him up one. I only gave this 4 stars because nothing and no one is perfect except the man up stairs.
4,"So far, so good","Haven't had it long enough to know about the long-run ops but it's good, initially. I liked the long cords - can alternate using it on two bikes without moving the charger."
5,battery tender junior,"This is my fifth. Great product, great warranty backup, original of the five still working."
1,Used to be good,"Started using these tenders over 10 years ago, back then they worked great. I have a lot of batteries so I am continually adding tenders and the ones I have bought in the last few years have mostly been junk. As others have said the warranty ""isn't"" so you basically are tossing 20 dollars away. I'm buying another brand now, they cost a little more but have been rock solid for the last couple of years."
4,uses of charge,I bought this battery charge to use between my lawn tractor and portable generator. Purchased a extra harness so that each piece of equipment has it's own harness attached to each battery. This battery charger works great between the two.
5,Works as stated,I bought this for my scooter and it works like it's supposed too. I like the extra clips so that you can hook it up easier. It feels like it is quality made.
5,Battery Tender for our Harley during the winter.,"This tender is small, compact, and very easy to install. The light indicators make use completely fool-proof. I would recommend this unit, especially compared to the ones sold at the dealer for considerably more money."
5,tender jr.,i had one of these in the past for my seca 2.now that i have a fz6 a tender jr was a must.i live in north dakota so winter storage is important.with these you can hook it up during the winter and forget it.(until spring that is).these are very good quality and there are man knock off brands but you get what you pay for so go with the original.
1,battery tender junior,"works intermittenly (have to move or jiggle to get to work, it's not the 110 volt connection) poor product. required word"
5,Great during winter!,This unit works as it should...by keeping your battery up while you are riding for an extended amount of time due to weather and etc...
1,Does not charge,"This product does not work for any of the batteries I own. I thought it was because my battery was dead, but I had it tested and it was healthy."
3,"no problems here, just as described","This equipment has preformed great, made in china was a little disappointing never buying another for that reason. but other than that no complaints"
1,Can not charge empty battary,"The product is useless, it's unsuitable for empty batteries. I highly recommend to not purchase this product. This is a hidden fact, you won't find it in the product description."
1,Piece of junk,"2 months after I got it and went to vacation, this piece of junk failed, went short and destroyed $100 battery. You don't need this ""fancy"" thing with LED lights to tell you what it's doing (or not). They are trying to invent Ohm law all over again. To keep your battery charged, you need ordinary battery charger. You can buy 12V/1000 mA charger for much less and use it at the same way without flashing lights in different color. Don't waste your money on fancy junk."
4,Junior is a great bang for the buck charger,"I have owned a Battery Tender ""plus"" for many years, 15 at least. The plus has always worked, so I bought this one. I connected it to an Odyssey 680 AGM battery in my recently ridden BMW motorcycle. I got a red light, then a flashing green light about an hour later... then a solid green light by the next day.With a solid green light I read 13.1 volts with a digital volt meter.Mixed reviews here, but for the price it is a smart charger that works as advertised in my case.Quik tip: always connect any charger to the battery first then connect to the wall outlet.do the same in reverse when taking it off, remove wall power first, then disconnect the battery."
2,Battery Tender Junior,"As a charge maintainer, it is great. But if you need something to recharge a dead battery, be prepared to wait a long time before you get a full charge. Mine took two days to recharge even after I borrowed a larger battery charger to get a partial charge for my Ford F150 which has a large, heavy duty battery."
1,JUNK don't last long - don't waste your money,I had one of these and paid way to much for it. I bought it to top off three 12v scooter batteries before daisy chaining them for a 36v scooter. Got it out recently to do the same with 4 small scooter batteries and it burnt out before I could them done. I'm buying a real SC-300A charger/maintainer for about what I paid for this thing. This is a miniscule 0.75AMP compared to 3.0AMP for the SC-300A. Both come with the same 3 connectors.
4,My Moto battery Charger,"Great price, short delivery time, looks good made product, I'm happy with it even I did not test on my bike yet, my bike is new!! but I have it for back up or the winter."
5,Perfect for a truck I drive sparingly,"I have a truck that I drive about once a week. When I start it up, it seems to struggle just a bit to turnover. Since car batteries last longer fully charged, I bought this float charger to keep the battery happy. Now the truck turns over just fine.There is a larger, 1.5 amp trickle charger available but this one brings my battery to a full charge in about a day after a short drive. Since its just a ""wall wart"" with a cord, I plugged it into the same outlet as my garage door opener and bought the cigarette lighter adapter. Connecting the truck is quick and easy and I never have to mess with opening the hood. Note that you must have a cigarette lighter adapter wired for always-on power for this to work or you'll have to re-wire it accordingly, though."
5,Small footprint and easy to install.,"The device works well so far, was easy to install and I can leave it connected to the battery during normal use. I installed it on the Yamaha Rhino Side by Side. I have only had it a short while so can't attest to longevity."
4,As expected. A++++,"Recieved as expected and in a timely manner. 4 stars, nothing deserves 5 stars that is perfect but this was pretty close."
2,Maybe not this one!,"This is hard to review as the alarm is loud enough to wake the dead, not too sure it hasn't here. However, my star rating comes down on functional frustrations. It worked fine for awhile (about 2 months) and now I can't get the delay part of it to work so I can leave with it still in tack. It is supposed to work so you have two minutes to leave before it goes off. But the second you open the door the 10 second warning starts counting down. Great when it works, but frustrating to get it to work if you ever can. Not worth the money in my book."
2,one hit group,Neil Sedaka knew what he was doing when he went solo and broke from this group...the lion sleeps was a good song but just that nothing else to add...
4,Good,"I bought a book I needed for school and got it at a really good rate. It was in the condition described when it arrived, however it took a while for it to arrive at my home. Good packing, good price, all around I'm happy!"
1,Murder in Suburbia,Disappointing story lines.Too sloppy acting.Did not develop characters.Expected better of Caroline Catz. Really loved her in Doc Martin.Very sexist towards.
3,Could be better,"This puzzle has a great visual appeal, however the pieces do not fit together well, they are too loose and come apart easily. If the frame is jarred just a little it will come apart, so care has to be taken when working the puzzle."
2,not very happy with this company,"the product was fine & shipped very quickly. But i was sent the wrong size. I couldn't get in touch with the company by phone. Instead they e-mailed me a few days later & said that I could mail the product back & when they recieved it they would mail out the replacement, but i did explain that I needed the costume sooner than that. I was also told that I would have to pay for return shipping again & then shipping for my new product. I don't think that's right when I was sent the wrong size!!"
2,Brando Spinning in a Void,"The first film in Marlon Brando's five-picture deal with Universal, ""The Ugly American"" (1963) is a dreary political drama that the actor cannot bring to life. Flat direction by George Englund - further hindered by the obvious backlots substituting for Thailand. Brando tries, but has nothing to work with here."
5,Girl who Knows Her Dolls,"Nina Antonia knows her stuff. Carefully researched, written with a real feel for the music - and the clothes - this is the book for anyone who wants to know the truth behind the Dolls story. With 3 of the principals dead - 2 of them chaps that our authoress knew well - it's unlikely that anyone will write a better Dolls retrospective than this.Nina gets close to the core of this strange, doomed band and examines what it was about them that so intimidated the straight musicbiz. Not that they needed any outside assistance in wrecking their career. This book pulls no punches when it comes to the dirt...Ultimately, one concludes that if Johnny Thunders wasn't a great guitarist, he was certainly a Great Poster."
5,A great book about a great band,"ok maybe their music wasnt perfect or their playing abilities werent the best but they were way ahead of their time. This book has everything, addictions, lovers, music and sad endings for some. A great tribute to the most forgotten band. They never got the respect they deserved for the style they started which is so copied now."
5,This Bear was a Life Saver!,"I received a bear like this for a baby shower gift. I thought it was adorable and planned on keeping it as a keepsake. But my son had his own plan! By the time he was 6 months old... he was grabbing for it and it ended up going every where with him (car, bed, grandma's, outside, ect..) From previous experience... I knew I needed another. Of course by then, you couldn't find them at the store. I ended up finding it here. And 4 years later, he still has both of them on his bed :-)"
5,Gonna bang in your face,This is heavy aggressive damage and it's gonna bang in your face just like Westwood.
5,Prison to Praise,I have bought cases of these booklets to give to servicemen. They are a great witness for the Lord.
5,GREAT BOOK,I SENT THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE IN PRISON.HE SAID HE ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND IT WASHELPING HIM.
1,Spool Diameter Incorrect,"The paper is fine but the spool it comes on is the wrong size for standard dispensers. Image shown showed a 1"" center roller when in reality it was 3-4"". Rather than send it back I had to ""reroll"" it on the old spools which was both time consuming and impossible to keep even and tight."
4,1000mAh Eurus Internal Li-Polymer Battery for Palm m500 m505 m515 PD,"I aquired an old IBM C500 (identical to the Palm M500. except IBM branded) with a bad battery. After searching for a replacment I chose the 1000mAh Eurus Internal Li-Polymer Battery for Palm m500 m505 m515 PDA. This is a great battery, added lots of capacity and I can use this PDA for weeks on end without a hotsync. It was fairly easy to install, if you are not too squeamish about taking stuff apart. I would warn you to be careful pulling your old battery away from the glue. If you pry too hard you can cause the LCD to have permanent splotches. I have one bad patch because I was in a hurry to get the upgrade done."
4,Turn of the century CSI,"Absolutely loved it. Interesting characters, intriguing mysteries and the beginnings of forensic science. Entertaining and intelligent"
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"Although the title makes it sound more legit and/or serious than The Complete Idiot's Guide to Latino History and Culture, this is by far the inferior product. It isn't organized nearly as well, and the questions in the Q&A; format are written ... well, stupidly ... no one would ask some of these questions and if they would, they wouldn't ask them like, ""What kind of food do Puerto Ricans like?""The author has an obvious political/racial bias beneath his transparent attempt to appear the objective historian. That might be okay, if he didn't make sweeping generalizations and cheap jabs at certain groups of people.Having said all that - though it's not the best book on the subject, if you can get past the irritating characteristics, it might be a good buy if you can get it used ... or from the library."
5,This is a much under-appreciated artist.,"martina mcbride has been looked over long enough, and this album should show anyone interested in music that she has the range the voice to sing any genre, any song. ""Bornt to Give My Love to You"" is one of my favorites on the album, along with the emotion of ""Phones Are Ringin'."" Every song on the c.d. deserves any country music fan's atttention. Her voice flows quietly like a river when needed,and explodes powerfully to cover you from head to toe in feelings."
2,"Beware, Some Re-records May Be Present","This commentary applies to CD numbered: NSCD 003.The following note is provided inside the liner notes: ""For the benefit of the listener this product may have been compiled from a variety of sources, including where thought appropriate, live material. Due to the age of some master tapes, tape hiss may be audible. Where this is an unacceptable level tracks may have been replaced by re-recordings by the original artist.""I think they should have been able to edit out the hiss, but maybe not in 2001. I can remove a lot of it with my little home program."
3,It's Pronounced: Ralph One To Foresee For One!,"This is the seminal work in sci-fi by the man who's editing direction shaped the modern genre, Hugo Gernsback, the guy they named the Hugo Awards after.A future where everyone wears electric roller skates, has a number instead of a last name and cities have moving side walks... One of theose travelogues of the future extrapolated by a writer from the very beginings of the pulp era. The gadgetry seems almost Victorian, the philosophy seems dated, yet somehow you'll never forget this book.I read this book in the early 60's and it was already very quaint and dated even back then. But somehow I've never forgotten it and parts of this book come to mind even now almost 40 years later. If you've ever seen the 1930 film ""Just Imagine,"" then this is the literary equivalant."
3,"You'll need one soon, get a spare now.",The DeWalt miter saw stand increases the usefulness of the miter saw by many orders of magnatude! If you use your saw and stand as often as I use mine you will break one of these support arms. I rare this a three out of five stars only because I have had to replace two of them. There seems to be a problem with the welds on the clamp nuts.Great stuff. I think I own one each of everything DeWalt makes.James HatsisJames1@OconeeAirService.com
1,"""Hawke""... a real clanger","The book ""Hawke"" by Ted Bell is a thrilling adventure novel. Sadly, the story was poorly edited. Research was really lacking in the novel and errors were so blatant that even average people who read thrillers but are not in the military could notice the mistakes. The word 'obviously' was obviously overused.In the end one painfully finishes the novel to see what other thriller cliche the author will use.You find yourself looking for errors because you bought the book,you want to finish it,you know the author must have done this on a dare,so you slog your way to the end. I hope Mr. Bell has got ""write a novel"" off his list of things to do in life because ""buy a Bell novel"" is sure off my list of things to do in life."
1,The best book in the world ever...! If you're 12.,"Very rarely do I buy a book that I absolutely cannot stand. Unfortunately, this is one such book. There was no medal awarded for having read it, although I feel like I deserve one.I wonder if a cross between Treasure Island, Sherlock Holmes, a Boys' Own adventure and a modern day thriller is something that any author can pull off. One thing is for certain: Mr Bell can't and nor can his editors.Annoying, childish, poorly researched and written are just some of the ways I would summarise this book. There are so many better books out there (pretty much anything other than this one), so do yourself a favour and look elsewhere."
1,Juvenile at best.,"Seriously, the target market for this book is adolescent boys between 15 and 18. I'm not in this category and thought this book was childish. The hero ""Alex Hawke"" would make a better villian character. I didn't couldn't bring myself to finish this book but I hope the hero was killed in the end."
5,Clancy in his dreams...,"...writes 'em as good as this! The author has done his homework and it shows--you get inside the minds of the people who would do us harm and it is terrifying. Don't walk, run to get this book!! I can't wait for the sequel and the sequel and the sequel!!"
1,Silly,"This book is a totally mindless read and some may enjoy it for that. The main character is one of the most silly and irritating characters that I have encountered. I must confess, however, that I couldn't finish the book, so perhaps I am being unfair."
1,Disappointing,"I was very excited about this book when I first read the synopsis - the idea would get 4 stars.The problem with this book is in the execution. Gardner's characterizations just don't ring true, and I found them very distracting. In particular, I had problems with comments about Lorne (that he's a ""party demon"" and ""needs direction"") Wesley (if this is early season 4, as I expect it is, Wesley's relationships with the Angel Team were still pretty strained) and Connor. (thinking that ""Angel and his friends have never been anything but nice to me - I just need to find a place where I can think.""). Connor's confusion comes across clearly, but his rage does not. I tried to give the book a chance, but I was unimpressed with Gardner's grasp of the characters. I would probably not buy another book by this author, and I would DEFINATELY not buy one of his without reading a little of it first."
3,This book was good,I finally read Angel: Dark Mirror. I really enjoyed this book. The plot was good so was the background story about Wesley. I wish they were making more Angel books.
3,Death to Bored,"I am only giving this three stars because this season should have been strong enough to convince HBO to give it another go. Instead this turns out to be the final season of the series.Charming in turns and worth watching, even if you're wanting it to have more purpose than is ultimately has. Considering the collective talent involved, this series should have become ...something more than just bored to death."
3,Short and Sweet,"Written for the middle school library, this lavishly illustrated brief work, gives examples of major bridges with emphasis on engineering principles. More advanced than other bridge books for juveniles I have reviewed.Too bad it is going out of print.Good to encourage the new ""pontist"" (c.f.)."
5,tekton 1903 rectangle magnetic tray,"Good magnetic tray,has rubber coating on thebottom to protect what you use it on.Largeenough size to hold plenty of nuts, bolts,or what you need to put in it.Good price to."
5,Unique and Creative - Good resource book,The book is just wonderful. Has so many unique ideas on how to use green tea . Loved all the summer recipes with ginger and pineapple. Recipes are well thought out and very doable.Great Photos
2,Really Not Like My Other Birkis,"I have other Birkenstock mules, but this pair felt really narrow. I usually wear a 40N, but these were tight and uncomfortable over the top of my foot. I ended up returning them for a refund since they never left the house. As soon as I put them on I knew these were never going to work and ""breaking them in"" was not an option. I had a similar problem with another Birkenstock style and returned them as well."
3,Better than people say,This has some flaws and is camp in places but worth the watch! Buy it! See these early directors and stars do movie magic on a shoe string budget.
4,Decent book,"This is a good place to start prepping for the test. Also, the CAT tests are fairly accurate. I got a 690, 700, and 730 on the CATs and got a 710 on the actual exam. But this book doesn't cover everything you need to hit 700+ on the test. Go to GMATClub.com and research how others have prepped for the test. I used PR, Kaplan, Veritas, Manhattan GMAT, etc."
3,3 Year Expiration Passed,"The product is great. The CD ROM is great. Now that I have taken it, it feels like the real test. However, I have two complaints.One, the CD ROM written portion does not have all of the shortcut keys that the test has. Kaplans version is closer to the original. Maybe my keyboard was messed up, but some of the CTRL+RIGHT ARROW, CTRL+LEFT ARROW, etc. combinations did not work. That actually gives you less time than you think, because you can't control the keyboard as well as the actual test.My second complaint is a big one. The test results have to be uploaded to the Princeton server website to be scored. That is a problem because after three years, the website is no longer able to calculate scores. They expire. The Kaplan CDs are good only with the CD, but nothing else is required and there is no time limit on scoring. So, any Princeton CD that is older than three years is useless if you want an actual score and not a scaled score."
5,I wish I was the fly,I must say that out of all Trista Russell's book i loved this one i read this book in one day. I love how she made you feel like you were right there looking at the whole thing.When i was done reading this book i wanted more. i love the dialogue between the 2 characters it felt very real to me. The only thing that i wish that Mrs. Russell would have done or maybe can do in a sequel is tell us what happen next the ending just left you hanging.
4,Hoping for a Part 2,I love this book. I gave it four stars just because I think it could have continued. The ending didn't really sound like an ending. Did Theo make it to the NBA? I would like to know.
3,Worth the price,"This book was good, and will make you think differently about business and life. I found it to be a very fun book to read, and Bo is a good storyteller. What he has to say about the importance of having a network, his networking style, the way that networking has helped him, etc make the book worth the price. Is Bo a shameless self-promoter? - sure he is, but most people could use a little more of that in their lives.Bo is not a professional writer, and does not pretend to be. What Bo is very good at is getting his point across and making you think. This is a good book for those just getting into networking, as it will get you pointed in the right direction. Follow this up with ""Dig your well before you're thirsty"" by Harvey Mackay and ""Networking is a contact sport"" by Joe Sweeney."
1,I can't believe this got published,"This is perhaps the worst book ever written on any subject. Bo may be good at some things, but writing is not one of them. If you can pick through the ridiculously poor grammar and structure, you will find that the book is a collection of uninteresting stories from Bo's career that have no value for anyone other than Bo.This man makes Donald Trump seem outright humble. Please don't waste your money."
3,be aware,"Please be aware that the item you are purchasing matches the picture displayed on the product page. It does not match the ""boxed"" picture. You do not get all of the toys that are show on the box."
3,a little disturbing,"The first episode is quite disturbing. Loved the books, the series may be a little too graphic for me to watch."
2,Brunetti should be Italian,"I had for a long time been an enthusiast of the Donna Leon Brunetti novels, set in Venice, because of their atmosphere and authenticity; I was extremely disappointed to discover that the DVD series was made by a German company with german speaking actors. This destroyed the essential Italian nature of the work."
1,really bad adaptation of books,"if you are a Brunetti fan be warned-they are NOT true to the book at all, they don't even match up actors based on the character descriptions the author provided.This is in German with subtitles- and it is a really old show, the film quality isn't great.:(I love Brunetti, hate this show."
1,Don't buy from PC Universe,Don't buy from PC Universe for the advertised $9.03 (if it is still there) because they will simply cancel your order. I thought the deal too good to be true (yet they wouldn't honor the price). Hopefully you are reading this review and it makes absolutely no sense because PC Universe has retracted the Imation 4 GB thumb drive for $9.03 ($6.98 S&H) from this site.
4,Average,"Its ok nothing much exciting, video quality is average, I have read a lot about Nostradamus, and Edgar Cayce.There are other stories about the fatima in portuguese, and Roman Catholic Church,Leonardo Da vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, Antichrist, Hitler and some thing about Book of Revelation and all that, but nothing in detail, so I did not get what I expected. but for the price under $10 it is alright I would purchase it."
5,Where's the Blu ray???,"Great series, great production just like ""Ancient Aliens"". There's only one problem, where's the HD version of this in Blu ray???"
2,Samo Levski :-),Eho mnogo qko IMA i Bulgarski par4eta. Ina4e cqlata muzika e interesna i inovativna za men.
5,love it!,"This canister looks great and has basically two parts inside so I can put the q-tips on the outside and cotton balls for me on the inside. I guess they are all like that??? Have not had one before, but it is more aesthetically pleasing to have this on the counter instead of the q-tip package!"
4,Night Scope Once The Night Light Is Gone,"I grabbed this for my son and it came yesterday.Listen, it is not a professional night scope. But the kid liked it anyway. I had him running around claiming he was a spy all day. And for him, there's no difference between a tinted light and a real night scope.For daddy, however, that isn't the case. But I need a few more Amazon bucks before I make that purchase. :)"
4,The boys loved it!,I gave this to my two 4-year old grand nephews. Both boys loved it and wanted to play with it immediately. It was a big hit!
3,Nice gift for a child,"Gave this gift to my 5 year old nephew for Xmas, and he loved it. He didnt seem to care that it was basically a flashlight with the binoculars. The older kids wouldn't have liked it as much."
5,A good gadget,"If you want to get a good look at what's crawling around in your backyard at night, if you have a strong desire to play a prank on your older brother at midnight, or if you just want a way to get to the fridge without using that REALLY, REALLY noisy light switch, has Wild Planet got a toy for You!!!! The spy night scope is good for taking a closer look at things at night. It features magnificaton and a pop-up light. And for those covert missions, there is a green stealth light that dimms-down the total radius of the light beam(and it looks stealthy). I've had this for a while, and it only takes 2 AAA batteries. And for those of you who are REALLY into Spy Gear (like I am), check out the SPY MICRO KIT, the XP-4 SPY PEN, the XP-5 SPY WALLET, and the SPY BUG."
3,Fun with Fright,"To find the true measure of this tongue-in-cheek horror movie book, put it on your coffee table and use it to compare notes while watching a monster/horror flick. This thing is dead-on...and funny! The hilarious intro, written by drive-in movie expert Joe Bob Briggs, is worth the price of the book. You can easily use B-Movie Survival Guide to set up beer drinking games while yelling at the screen. (example -- drink a beer every time someone opens the cellar door.) Killer (no pun intended) illustrations, too."
2,Not really worth it,"I've had some self-taught experience learning German, and have pursued it through books only. This was my first venture into language tapes. At the end of two CD's you will have a vocabulary of perhaps twenty words (I didn't actually count them)and an ability to put together a fairly simple series of phrases into a reasonable sentence. $27.00 + for one sentence???No. There must be something out there a little more useful than this.On the positive side, I think about thirty such CD's going to a higher level would be useful and a lot of fun. But not at the price."
4,what doing good for your parent(s) can do for you.,"Convinces the reader faced with ""taking care"" of an aging parent that it's an opportunity as much as a burden. Book's strength: such a variety of real examples that you understand the need to search for an individual accommodation to your specific situation. Schiff's concept of the child who must now be the adult is good, though the phrase ""chadult"" seems silly. I have bought the book for both my sisters to help us work out a way to help our 92-year-old father."
5,Fantastic album,This is an amazing compilation of LED's own music. They are a hidden gem that is well worth finding. BUY THIS CD!
3,The ever changing world of Mike Scott,"Mike Scott has certainly found a way to reinvent himself. Even though he took the Waterboys name back to in his words ""reach a wider audience"", He is still pretty much a one man show. This album is a full sonic rock attack and a return to the big music sound. There are some great songs here. ""Let it Happen"", ""Rock in a weary land"" and ""Is she concious"" are some of the best stuff Scott has written. The sonic sound and distorted lyrics are a first and some of the older fans will be put off as they expect a crisp delivery from Scott. This is not a groundbreaking album and if you want the early 80's arena rock Waterboys or the late 80's folf/celtic Waterboys you may be disappointed. But if you like a full hard rock sound with some gadgetry thrown in. This is certainly as good as most of the big label stuff out there."
5,YOU FOUR LOUSY GUYS!,"AN EXCEPTIONAL FILM BY THE GREAT LEE, HOWEVER ONE WITH AN ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS MISTAKE. IN THE ENGLISH VERSION OF THE FILM, WHEN LEE IS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ENEMIES, THE DUBBED OVER VOICE CRYS ""YOU FOUR LOUSY GUYS"". ESSENTIAL VIEWING!"
3,Mistakes and Gaping Holes,"I honestly cannot believe they published this guide with so many mistakes. There are parts of it where the writing stops, and, when you expect it to turn up in the next column, it's got a new heading and talking about something completely different. Dan Birlew does a decent job explaining the dungeons and everything, but there is no map, and there are times where he gives you just a vague command. The best of the entire guide is the subquest listing. Especially since there are a lot of guides online that don't mention subquests, but just stick to the general storyline. Otherwise, I'd urge you to not spend the money and just find a good game guide site (gamefaqs.com is one I can think of off the top of my head)."
4,Good guide,"I remember liking this guide as I used it to beat this game, but at the same time it occasionally left with me unanswered questions. Perhaps there was an occasional error as well. Still, overall good buy to get all the little bits you're missing."
3,No dungeon map.,Bad: No Dungeon Map!!!! Hence I don't konw where those chests are. I have to search around myself.Good: Everything else is like other strategy guide.
4,Kneeling Chair offers a good change of pace,"I bought this to allow me to shift from my usual desk chair to something that would force me to move around a bit differently, stiffen my back, and alleviate some back strains I was having. Although it is a bit awkward to actually have two chairs at my desk, it's been a great help [when I remember to shift!]. It came unassembled but was easy to put together and works fine, the knee pads are comfortable and I have no complaints."
3,good chair,"It takes about 20 minutes before it really conforms, bit over priced. Good quality though."
4,Desire walks... away !,"In my opinion, not the band's best, but still a very solid effort, and Ann's voice is as addictive as ever. The sound is flawless, as usual.A very serious technical issue with this CD, though : my original copy (1993 release) suffers from the infamous ""Disc Rot"" symptom, which eventually made it unreadable. I had to re-order one copy (reissue), which arrived with the very same defect (though not as widespread as on my first copy) ; fortunately, I could duplicate the disc and it is now safe. I faced just the same problem with the Band's ""The Road Home"" CD.Does anyone know of a way to have the ""wasted"" copy replaced ?"
3,"Biased, but not without value","A scholarly, if admittedly selective survey of Africa's history from the mists of prehistory to the present day, this book manages to present a pro-African and often pro-Islam perspective to African history that is nonetheless unsettling. Keeping an optimism about the ability of post-colonial elites to solve the major crises that fit Africa, and somewhat whitewashing the Muslims (who come off much better than the Europeans in this tale), a certain anti-Western bias makes this book less excellent than it would otherwise be. It is nonetheless very well written and easy-to-read, its manifest bias obvious but not without value for those who wish to understand African history better from the various African perspectives. The book also contains a thoughtful analysis of the problems of town & country in African societies and the difficulty of solving structural problems of underdevelopment."
4,furstrating,I can get on this scale 10 times and get 10 different readings. it's been frustrating to say the least. an hour after I weight it may say I am up 2 lbs. it was a total waste of money.... I accidently gave this a 4 stars. it needed a 1.
1,Precise but not repeatable,What good it is knowing your weight to .5lb when weighing yourself twice in two minutes gives weights that are 2-3 lbs different? I don't have _this_ scale but I have a pricier WW scale that is next to worthless because I can't get consistent weights off of it. How can I know if I'm gaining or losing weight day to day or week to week if it gives me erratic readings minute to minute?
3,Sisters of Death,"During an college sorority initiation ceremony, a pledge in the Secret Society of Sisters is accidentally shot and killed. Seven years later the six remaining members receive invitations (and $500) to attend a reunion. Only one of the Sisters knows the invitation was sent by the dead girl's father.From the Farrah Fawcett hairdos to the Starsky & Hutch clones, the low-budget SISTERS OF DEATH looks like a made-for-tv movie. This 1978 movie stars 1970 Playboy Playmate of the Year Claudia Jennings (Sorry, no nudity in this one.) The girls, driven to a remote desert estate by Starsky & Hutch, soon find themselves prisoners behind a powerful electric fence. Papa's hidden somewhere inside, packing gunpowder into some nasty looking bullets when not roaming through hidden passages.The plot of SISTERS OF DEATH is tried and true and a little tired, and a few too many twists are thrown in at the end, but the movie is pleasant enough."
4,Again?,"i havent listened to this one yet, but i heard its missing one of the best tracks in the movie - The A La Menthe. this is the same thing that happened with the first soundtrack, the music of the scene where danny is first coming out of the jail cell is missing, that was one of the best tracks.i was overall disappointed with ocean's 12 anyways. the first one was pulled off so perfectly, it was artistic. then, in the sequel, they get screwed up or screwed over in so many ways. and they couldnt even keep the camera still the whole movie, i hate that ""effect""."
4,good buy!,"Even though it had no booklet, or seemed to be a non-sellable item, it was well worth the price. I was also disappointed with the fact that it was missing one of the last tracks (the ""laser"" song), but that is not your fault.Great buy!"
1,Night Fox song,"The previous post was exactly what I was looking for, leave it to the soundtrack folks and amazon to leave the best song off this site."
2,"Good, but.....","Like everyone else we wanted the best song of the movie and it's not on the soundtrack. My mistake, next time I'll know better."
4,"Good Stuff, Missing Stuff","This is a good compilaiton but missing some key tracks found in the movie. Most importantly is the track ""The A La Menthe"" by the group La Caution. This is the piece found in the scence where the nightfox dances around the lazer field. This is im my opinon the best piece of the film and its very hard to get i had to find it from an alternate source. If you find a place to by the album called ""The sounds of kourtrajme"" by La Cation please post its location."
4,The Nightfox Song,For all of you who are loking for the Nightfox laser dance song you can download it off what I believe is the artists website. Enjoy. http://www.kourtrajme.com/accueil.htm
4,"The Nightfox ""Laser Dance"" Song (more information)","The song that plays when the Nightfox is breaking into the museum is called ""The À La Menthe"". To be specific, the version played in the movie is ""The À La Menthe (The Lazer Dance Version)"" as the original version has rap lyrics provided by the talented brothers Hi-Tekk and Nikkfurie of the band La Caution.It's true that there is a two minute sample available from the website of their production company (called Kourtrajme). This is not the full, six-minute version of the song though. You may be disappointed. It's here at the bottom of the page: http://www.kourtrajme.com/accueil.htmThe album on which both versions of the song appear is available here on Amazon. It's called ""Arc En Ciel Pour Dal Toniens"".The soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic but lacking as far as this song is concerned."
4,The Blue Laser Lite song by Nikkfurie....,"If you saw Oceans 12 and wanted the Blue Laser Lite Song, follow the intructions from the review""Here's the FULL song!!!, The instructions he provides are right on the money. It's a very cool song. If you don't find the review, here's the link.http://www.zaycev.net/pages/111/11109.shtmlI'll copy his instructions as well;""Now...the page is completely in Russian text, but you will find a link that looks like this: [mp3] next to a few other choices. Right click, save as, and POOF. You have a 6.18MB mp3 file with the full song! Actual song is 4m30s long.Enjoy.............Thanks to "" Non-personalized ""Alan"""
4,Good! Could Be Better.,"so I bought this soundtrack the day it came out. I personally think that the Oceans 11 soundtrack was better, but this soundtrack has an amazing ""twist"" to it...if that makes sense. Its got a bit of European twist i guess, considering the movie is pretty much in Europe and what not.Most of the tracks are ""urban mix"" with a ""twist"".There are a couple of french songs...Wish I could say more, but I just got it...so Im listening to it now! Can't wait for the movie this friday!"
2,ocean's 12 soundtrack,expected something much better- the actual music from the movie instead of instrumentals
1,Dream Interpretation,"Does my subconscious know that there are rules to be followed when it comes to my dreams? i hope my mind has read this book before so it can accurately symbolize my feelings. Are our minds so predictable that a few sentances can decode the same symbols in the same exact way in everyone's [different] mind?""A dream of an accident is usually a warning to avoid whatever was involved (knife car, train, plane, etc)..""This books is as helpful as a stale bag of fortune cookies."
2,Broken...,"I bought these and probably dug about ten 3 foot holes before they broke at the pivot point. The actual bolt that connects the two handle pieces broke, and it looks to be about 3/8"". The way its built, you can not just put another bolt in to fix. I would not recommend, there are better post hole diggers out there.UPDATE* I talked to Fiskars and sent them a picture of the broken axis bolt. They sent me a new pair in the mail quickly."
3,Great phone - weak Cingular reception,The features are great including the display. I am not pleased about the low bar/ no bar recpetion I get in areas that the Sony phone I had (but didn't like ) did much better at.
2,"Good phone, bad software","This is a nice looking phone packed with functions and features, and it can be used anywhere in the US and Europe for making phone calls. It has the additional advantage of being able to make use of 3G service in Europe as well. The downside to this phone is that the phone was made in Singapore, the software has a particularly annoying bug that prevents the phone from notifying you of a voicemail receipt, and US Motorola will not fix it on warranty. Amazon shouldn't be selling a product that isn't covered by a US warranty."
3,"Works well, as advertised","The product pretty much does as it claims. I got it mainly for the glass wipes, and I wish the container was bigger (for some reason I thought it was bigger when I ordered it). But the wipes are good - they clean the windows well, although I do wipe them down after with a papertowel to remove any residue. The interior wipes are good - the cleaning ones work well on all surfaces. Not sure that the protectant ones are all that useful, but I guess we will see over time if they help."
5,This book has a depth that creeps up on you,"This book has become an integral part of my daily life. The depth of knowledge creeps up on you. You will be quite suprised. I love it. A grateful reader, from, the Sonoma Valley."
2,Horrible packaging,"This sticker came in a huge box with some sort of company book in it, which I assume caused the sticker to get smashed and completely wrinkled. The decal was already peeled off part way, otherwise if it were straight and not packaged with a book, im sure it would be fine."
1,"A derivative, cut-and-paste cheapie.","A definitive biography of Lana Turner has yet to be written. Wayne has read Turner's memoirs and those of her daughter Cheryl Crane and Turner's ex-secretary to produce this trifle. The book is not sourced, there is no original research, and the result is a rehash of old info. Wayne even relies on supermarket tabloids for details she includes about Turner's final illness. A few pages of grainy snapshots of Turner round out this meager effort. Save your money."
5,Excellent Recording of an Under-Appreciated Work,"Beethoven's Christ on the Mount of Olives is rarely performed or recorded, and is often criticized for its mixture of operatic and oratorio forms (which are not so different to begin with). However, it's a wonderful little piece that has more affinities with Mozart's Magic Flute than Bach's Passions. It includes a lovely duet (gorgeously sung here by Gedda and Deutekom), an even better trio, a neat little fugue, and an awesome choral number depicting the Roman soldiers capturing Jesus, which sounds like a German drinking song! Gedda sings a heroic Jesus with a voice that is both powerful and mellifluous. His performance is itself worth the price of the CD. Sotin and Deutekom (one of the most under-appreciated sopranos on record)are also excellent, and the orchestral playing conducted by Wangenheim is extremely spirited. Needless to say, I highly recommend this recording."
3,Should have read the reveiws,"I just purchased this game and after playing it I wish I had looked at the customer reveiws first. Although it isn't a really bad game, it is at best mediocre compared to others of this genre. The controls are not as solid as in other aerial shooters. The throttle control is a real pain and the fact that the bombs and rockets automatically replenish takes away some of the challenge. The graphics and sound are good and the missions are pretty interesting. I haven't flown all the planes yet but it looks to have a wide variety of British and American planes. Good game but wait for the ""Platinum"" version or buy it used."
1,The Accidental Tourist,"Did not care for this book at all. Too disjointed, situations too unbelieveable. The book was very slow moving and actually dull. Characters inside and outside the main family were bizarre."
4,A really fun book about the fear of involvement,"This book is very entertaining. Better than the movie...William Hurt was about right, Geena Davis wasn't. The heroine defies decription."
2,the accidental tourist,the accidental tourist is one of the worst books i have read in years! it is not worth the price of $11.99. i did not finish it and wish i could get my money back! (i did not ask AMAZON). everything else i have bought from amazon for my KINDLE has been wonderful!
5,One for the Male Ego,"Anne Tyler has writtenm a wonderful engrossing satorff filled with fascinating people.And, wonders of wonders,. she tells of a man who is not a vacuous, passive, cipher of life.At least in the last pages."
3,Warm up to it by Accident or Design,"This is not an action-packed novel and it does not get off to a galloping start. But trust me, it does get better. About a third of the way through the book, you discover you really are interested in the characters and what is happening in their lives. You begin to develop hope and optimism for the relationships they pursue. That's when the story runs away with you. By the time you finish the novel, you feel inspired by the various kinds of love and ties that bind each relationship. Keep it on the shelf when you're through with it--you may want to read it again."
4,worth the read,"I also thought this was so boring in the beginning and doubted the merit of finishing it. Now I'm so glad that I did finish it - so many real characters, some real, some very shallow.. I came to love Macon's honesty with himself. It was almost as if he was gradually reborn into a life of spontaneity, joy, love and confetti."
3,Tourist review,"This is good reading, low key, entertaining. If you are looking for sex, crime, thrill a minute, it is not for you. It is for the person who just wants to relax with a good book."
2,JLRRAD - BORING,I was so surprised. This book had so many glowing reviews. So I boought it at one of Amazaon's great low price. I had the hardest time getting into it. I am an avid read and no matter how bad a book is I am going to finish it. This was almost the 1st exception to that rulle. It was very hard to keep up with who was talking and to who they we talking to or where they ever where. She really missed the mark on this one for. me.
1,Out-Based Massage,This book was one of my required text during Massage school. I found it to be a very hard read. Too much fluff & not enough stuff. The majority of my fellow classmates felt the same.
5,That First Review is Incorrect,"This Cd is sweet. Yes, it would help if you liked Strangefolk when you purchase this Cd, but even if you don't, its still awesome. I have given copies to friends as gifts and they have been thanking me ever since. AOD is on the rise to becoming a major band and its great to see their first live album hold so much energy. Buy this album now or you will forever live in a world of unhappiness."
4,Commander Silly Pants,"I thought that this book was one hootin' hollerin' good time!!! It made me jump, it made me cry, but most of all it made me pee. I can't tell you how many times I've looked at a story like this and said ""Boy, I'd like a snowcone right about now."" but when I read this fine piece of reading material I found myself squeeling in extacy. I like the pretty colors and the way my eyes cross when I try to read the small text...."
4,Live and kickin',Dion rocks as always. Good selection of songs from his all but thin songbook.Rather poor audio though. This one is for the real fan.
1,This movie is for the horn dogs,"Within the first two minutes a woman is showing her ta-tas. Then in the next, everyone is naked. I thought I was getting a version of Snow White, not some cheesy 70s horror/porn flick (LOL, should have known), but this will appeal to someone out there."
3,"Contains some hard to find info, but much is dated.","Bought this looking for some hard to find livestock feeding info involving crop screenings. Has some tried and true advice for raising livestock, but much of it is dated and in some cased it is good that agriculture moved on from the recommendations."
3,I love the author's work,"I would and do recommend Bell's work. I will include him in my next purchase of reading material, as a nook book hopefully"
2,Didn't bother to finish it.,"I have to agreee whole-heartedly with the negatice reviwes of this book. Not a great follow-up to the first installment. Stokes' character is laughable as is the ""bad guy"". I got about 100 pages into it and could care less what was going to happen on 101."
3,Quite OK,"While Mr. Bell will never sleep in the pantheon of writers (or of researchers, for that matters), this book is a good beach reading.Sure, his characters are poorly defined, the author has no knowledge of the topics he covers (a 200ft yacht with Aegis anti-missile capability? An emir ""somewhere in Africa"" about to launch a worldwide Jihad unbeknownst of security services worlwide? but of course), he has a delicious skill at writing witty, funny dialogues and interesting interactions between those poorly written characters that make them spring to life.An entertaining reading"
3,Hawke is on the loose again.,"This is a book with lots of killing, and you should know that going in. I found though that this book was a bit disjointed and it didn't have the tight storyline of the first book in this series about Alexander Hawke (a new James Bond figure). There were two storylines in the book. In one we have Hawke and some of his buddies going into Indonesia after a particularly gruesome villain), and in the other we have Stoke and Ross in the Florida Keys after a villain that got away in the first book. I enjoyed the Stoke-Ross storyline better. Anyway, the book was exciting enough to keep me going and I will read the third book."
2,killed my desire to read more,"This was my second Ted Bell book and I must say it was better than the first (which is really not saying anything). The action is fast paced enough to keep you interested but in the end the horrendous technical inaccuracies, ridiculous characters, and poor writing make you wish you'd never started it.I made a long list of technical inaccuracies as I read, but I will limit this rant to only one. Hawke's super yacht (which we know already contains a plane and a speed boat from his last book) is now equipped with an Aegis radar system! Most commonly seen on US guided missile cruisers and destroyers, Aegis' SPY 1 radar uses 4 gigantic phased-array panels that emit enough energy to cook a human being. Somehow he has secretly attached these to a yacht without anyone seeing them. ARG!"
4,"Tight cd, wish it wasn't an ep","Automator is fresh. If you lik tight beats and kool keith then this is the album for you. Kool keith is on most of the cd. Pretty much every song is good ,and kool keith rips it up. I also recommend Deltron 3030.."
4,"pre-DR. OCTAGON,great hip-hop blend!","Sorry KOOL KEITH makes this album,""King Of N.Y."",""Better Tomorrow(s)"",""I Want Da Mic"" and my all-time favorite ""Carton Capers"" bang this whole LP (EP whatever). THE AUTOMATOR and KOOL KEITH remind me of ULTRAMAGNETIC. Dan replacing CED-GEE on the boards and beats,Q-BERT overpowers anything MOE LOVE has done on the scratch (love ya MO). The other tracks of THE AUTOMATOR instrumental are cool. The other rappers SUCK badly! This album is why DR. OCTAGON (the group of KOOL KEITH,AUTOMATOR and Q-BERT) was so successful. I'm glad I bought this."
4,Loved this book.,"I've read this book at least twice & loved it every time. Perhaps because I am a musician, I have no problem with Reed's improvisational style, and I loved the concept of ""Jes Grew"" which pits uptight European culture against more expressive African culture.The main reason I wanted to leave a comment however, is to point out that it is interesting that the story deals with the same period and some of the same themes and characters as E.L. Doctorow's novel, ""Ragtime"" -- however Mumbo Jumbo came out before Ragtime did. I would venture a guess that Doctorow was aware of Reed's book before writing Ragtime."
5,One Hit Wonders,What a fun CD. Put it right into iTunes and onto my iPod. Great oldies by original artists and a joy to remember all those wonderful times all those years ago.
1,AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THIS INCORRECT POSTING,"NOTE: The title and production details provided here are incorrect, but the Product Description / Editor's Review is right. This title is ""Treasures of the Twilight Zone"" on Panasonic DVD [ ISBN 607865100595 ]."
3,MAMAS DON'T LET YOUR DAUGHTERS GROW UP TO BE NEANDERTHALS,"Robert Sawyer's TALES OF EUGENICS combines contemporary Western FASCISM with the growing ""marvels"" of genetic technology to give us a good look at what the future holds. To offset this depressing,pessimistic and somewhat cynical outlook he gives us a future filled with protections of the consumer's genetic makeup,a strong wife that loves her husband even given his physical frailties resulting from huntingtons,a PRESS that helped bring down corruption in corporate America and finally a WOMAN president of the US. I found FRAMESHIFT basically interesting with strong writing towards the end. Just think if Robert Sawyer had a gift for prose and unstilted dialogue,then maybe we could see one of his quotes as a Nobel Prize winner."
1,HP 6210,I returned this item!!! You had sent me a second one which I did not request and said you were going to charge me for it even though I had refused the UPS delivery and had it returned !!! I told you and requested you acknowledge your error which you did NOT do!! Now acknowledge this one!!
2,Paper jams and paper feeds multiple pages when printing,"When printing, paper feeder feeds 4 or more pages at a time and make the printer to jam every use. I returned it within a week of getting this issue and Amazon.com doesn't refund full either."
4,It does what it is suppose to do,My only issue is that the ink does not dry enough to use a highlighter on it.
2,"Good features, good quality, very short life","Good print/fax/copy quality - although colors tend to fade when documents are scanned (and reprinted). Nice set of features for its time (about 3-4 years ago now).BUT:I have gone through 3 HP printers the last 3 years: A PSC 2210, an original OfficeJet 7210, and a warranty replacement for the same. All three broke down with internal firmware/hardware errors, each after a period of ever-more frequent paper jams - the latter 7210 broke down yesterday with a cryptic error message on the front panel (someting like ""Error: 0xc500034441:some_file.c"") and all LEDs blinking rapidly. According to the HP support person I spoke to, this indicates a hardware malfunction; the printer is by now out of warranty as well. That ended my relationship with HP printers."
4,Good Followup To 'Encounters Of The Spooky Kind'.,"I'm not sure if this was intended as a sequel to 'Encounters of The Spooky Kind'. I enjoyed this film a lot. Basically, it was about Sammo's character trying to avenge the death of one of his friends, played by Wu Ma, who he suspects was murdered.There isn't much fighting in this one, compared to the previous film. Sammo has one big fight scene in the middle, and that's pretty much it. But the comedy is hilarious, especially when he's going around town arguing with his ghost friend who no one else can see!Lam Ching Ying didn't do any fighting in this film. He pretty much played the same role (Taoist priest) he would go on to play in his Mr Vampire films.Overall, a fun movie, even though the ending is sudden - like jumping off some cliff."
2,Sypnosis,"This story is about a Vietnamese Child who came to America.She needs money for her mother to come to America, so she and her class makes a fair so she can come.But Ut waits a long time and she never camed to see her.Then finaly it is the last day of school.And she sees her father and Little Quang.And beside them...her mother!"
5,Great Story and Art,"""Hammer of the Gods"" is stylish, operatic yet irreverent, sometimes reminiscent of the best bits of ""Samurai Jack"" in its terse, poignant storytelling and art, true to its roots in ancient Norse legend, well-written and composed... Michael Oeming and Mark Wheatley have outdone themselves in all aspects. It's ahead of its time."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of much of Michael Avon Oeming's work, but not of ""Hammer of the Gods"". It starts out reasonably well and has a decent premise, but the narrative rapidly devolves into a weird mixture of mythological memes and pop culture. Personally, I found it jarring to have a character hold forth in theatrical language in one panel - ""Though I most surely seal my own doom!"" - and then have another say something ""sucks"" a few panels later.More importantly, the story is all ""tell"" and not enough ""show"". Everything is explained and laid out too neatly, and there is nothing for the reader to do but sort of follow along and look at the (pretty) pictures. ""Hammer of the Gods"" simply didn't engage me at all, and while it isn't terrible, neither is it very good."
5,Awesome,I love this artist. Have two of their CDs now and they are perfect for relaxation and massage.
3,Not what I expected but I still play with it..,"When I saw this toy I wanted it very badly. Dont let the picture fool you. When I got it I was SOO happy! when we opend the box, Peopole could see the disapointment in My face. It was not like the picture at all. Its nose was all soft , the color was a very dark brown, The tail was short and rough, It was Kinda a huge disapointment. But Me and My friends still play with it."
2,Costuming From The Hip,"The book was a ""be creative"" summary. I expected more. (creative patterns) I did appreciate the references and the male dancer costumes."
1,this book is CRAP,"i buy this book for my girlfriend...its not a book, its a stapled pile of paper at the price of a hardcover book"
2,Taming the Star Runner- By S.E. Hinton,"Book Review By Sam K.In S.E. Hinton's Taming the Star Runner, a sixteen year old boy named Travis travels to the countryside to visit his uncle Ken. Travis is a tough looking city boy who can get himself out of any situation, and he has a hard time making friends at the ""hick school."" He decides to go to the barn to meet Casey, who introduces him to the Star Runner, a crazy untamed horse. Later Travis finds that he and the Star Runner have a lot in common.I didn't care for this book because it didn't have a lot to do with the Star Runner. I think S.E. Hinton should have added more detail on how the Star Runner got tamed. I would recommend this book to a young adult like Travis: a procrastinator from the city. I think this because I feel if you're like the character you can understand more about the story you're being told. It was an okay book."
4,Refreshing,"This is the first time I've ever read an S.E. Hinton book, and I must say that it's iffy if I read another. Taming the Star Runner had a great plot, but it could have been given a more in depth look. Taming is about a 16 year old boy going through problems and is sent to live with his uncle. His uncle happens to live on a ranch where he meets a girl named Casey who he starts to like. A friend of his comes to visit and he realizes that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.Although the book is quick paced and thrilling, it is pretty 2 dimensional. I felt no real depth within the characters to feel more close to them - and depth in character makes a book more enjoyable."
3,My Idea of Taming the Star Runner,"Taming the Star-RunnerI thought Taming the Star-Runner was an okay book. I thought it could have been better if it was shorter, because it was a little drug-out. The only reason I thought it was drug-out is because I don't really like long novels. The book is about a young man named Travis. He gets in trouble with the cops and is going to be sent away to his uncles house named Ken. Ken owns a ranch but is in the process of getting rid of it. Eventually, Travis falls in love with a girl named Casey, who is a jockey. Travis sometimes confused me with all of his mixed feelings, but I thought that it was a pretty good book. If you're looking for a little action and a little of romance, then this is your book. For those of you that enjoy medium-sized novels then this will be the book that you need to check out at the library."
3,"Not her best, but not bad","I read this book in a matter of days at a camp at the University of Tulsa. It, like her other books, deals with serious situations that a teen gets himself into. And, like her other books, the role of his parents in the book is not big, at least not for the mom. He tries to kill his step-dad, but I'd hate to give away the entire story. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it was possibly the worst S.E. Hinton book I've ever read, although I've only read three. It's about a teen who gets into some big trouble with the law (I already told you that one), and must go live with his uncle in small town/rural Oklahoma. This is funny because I go to school in the town in which this book takes place. If you think you like this plot, then try The Outsiders and Tex. This book isn't a waste of time or money, it's just that those books are a couple of the best I've ever read."
4,Taming the Star Runner,"Taming the Star RunnerI thought the book ""Taming the Star Runner"" was a good book. It was really interesting. I thought that the characters really seemed like they were real. The characters that they have chosen to play certain parts are great for them. I thought it was real interesting when Travis went to his uncle's so he wouldn't have to go back to juvenile hall. The one thing that I didn't like about was that from the title it sounded like it was going to be all about a horse. But it didn't. It was mostly about Travis going to live with his uncle and meeting some girl. But other than that I thought it was a really good book overall."
4,Purchased Book Review,"The book was in great condition, however the only problem was the fact that there was excessive highlighted marks. It made it difficult to differentiate my notes from theirs."
1,I know it when I see it,If you don't think this book is pornographic look at the other things people who purchased this have bought. Most involve the nude photography of children and there sensuality. This book also comes up when you search Amazon for pedophelia. Why is that? Stop deceiving yourselves.
1,A total waste of money,Sally Mann hasn't a clue how to capture the souls of those she photographs! If you are looking for artistic shots of 12 year olds then this book isn't for you. The picture on the cover is deceiving about the books contents. You're better off with buying the David Hamilton books (oh and by the way he is much better at photographing his subjects than Sally Mann could ever hope to be).
5,This Is The Countown To Exinction,"This is another favorite Megadeth record of mine. I bought this on cassett along with So Far, So Good...So What! back in the summer of 1992 and every now and than, I would pop it in my sterio. It's still has the same appeal. With this album, things are a little bit different. The heaviness, brutally, intensity and assualt is still here but it's more in the direction of The Back Album by Metallica. There are a lot of catchy, groovy, slow and mid-paced songs, plenty of melody, solos and magic moments. Some fans of the older Megadeth stuff may not like this album or they might just give up on Medegeth after this one but I cetainly find nothing wrong with it. I love poping it in and it always keeps me entertained. Some of my favorite songs here are Skin O' My Teeth, Symphony Of Destruction, Forclosure Of A Dream, Sweating Bullets, This Was My Life, High Speed Dirt and Psychotron. But this or become extinct."
5,An awsome c.d!!!,"This c.d rocks. I bought ""Risk"" 3 to 4 months ago,it is nothing at all compared to the total kick butt rock this c.d displays. Dave and Mary rule the guitars!!! Lyrically I think Megadeth is better than Metallica, but not as good at guitars ,but anyway, buy this c.d fast!!! Metallica and Megadeth are the best bands in the music world!!!"
3,MEGA!,"Metal metal metal. If you like metal you like megadeth. I respect these guys musical prowress but I don't partically love them. A few tracks are good, but it all sounds the same after awhile."
2,Digital Remaster sucks,"Anyone who purchased this album years ago will wince at the errors in the remaster, entire words missing from 'Countdown' and the remakes on the 2nd half of the album blows. I'd rather listen to Ween. Recommend if you are a true Megadeth fan is buy nothing but the original soundtrack, not the remasters or remakes."
2,EH.... my least favorite so far,"Hey, I have a lot of Megadeth albums, and this one definitely interests me the least. It just seems so uninspired and repetitive, and doesn't really grip you. Of course it couldn't be a Rust in Peace, but I wasn't expecting that. The solos in High Speed Dirt are good, but fail to amaze in most other songs. Skin O My Teeth, This Was My Life, Captive Honor, and Ashes in Your Mouth, are fair tracks, but only fair. Cryptic Writings and Youthanasia are really good. I haven't heard Risk really, but from what I've heard this one might be a better buy than Risk. I'd skip this one until you have Youth and Cryptic already."
2,what is wrong with you people???,"This album was a big disappointment for me. a few years ago when I was just another big Metallica fan I heard of a great group called Megadeth and one of the greatest metal albums called countdown to extinction. so I bought this album and instead of the great metal album I expected to I got simple chords, silly lyrics and some good guitar solos. luckily a good friend of mine loaned me Youthanasia and I really liked it then I got Rest In Peace and So Far, So good... so what? and those were killer albums also. now I got most of Megadeth's work and I can't believe I almost missed this great band because of one bad album, C.T.E. if you haven't heard Megadeth yet do yourself a big favour, get R.I.P and pass this one or you might miss a great band."
1,"Carful when purchising from this seller, i was lied to.","I bought a Remastered, Bonus content Edition CD from this seller, and when it can it did not have the bonus content, If you about buying a CD from this seller, be carful you can be lied to."
2,Don't fix what ain't broke!,"If you listen to this new version of countdown you miss out on so much. And you might think; well I don't care it's the songs that are important not the production and I get alot of bonus songs with this one but when the producer miss out on basic things like getting the volume levels right and maintaining the atmosphere it just isn't the same anymore. This album is sloppy produced with only one thing in mind, and that is to milk the most money out of fans possible from this already perfectly produced album. The only bonus song that isn't a demo(shrug) is crown of worms and that is available on the terrific maxi-single 'train of consequences'."
3,It didn't need it!,"I bought So far, Peace Sells, and Rust in Peace and This one. I thought the first three needed the remixing and mastering, but this one? I really think Dave messed this one up. He took all of the ambient reverb out of the recording, and now it sounds thin and weak...I mean Ashes in Your Mouth is one of the heaviest recordings...but it sounds Crappy, andworse than the original. Do your self an favor and don't buy it. I regret it!"
3,Remastered version not for me,"I bought this album not knowing what ""Remastered"" actually meant in terms of changes to the original works. I used to own the original a long time ago and wanted to have it again. At first I thought the tracks sounded slightly different, then I started to get real pissed off when I figured out that some of my favorite riffs and solos were completely changed.This version is weak, and I wish I had paid more attention to what I was buying. If you are looking for the original works, don't buy this version."
5,Great cd!,"This cd I believe is one of their best albums ever! I give all A+'s to each of the songs, especially Countdown to Extinction (title track). It's a really good song! After all, it reminded me alot of Metallica's self titled album that was released in 1991."
3,Great album,"This band has sold more than twelve million albuns. It's a great accomplishment by a metal band who never sold out ( well, at least totally ... ). So, why I'm givin this great album ( no doubt the best album of the Marty Friedman era )only three stars ? BEcause I keep guessing how many more albuns this band would have sold if Dave Mustaine were a humble person and hired a real singer. His voice destroys the songs, it's great suffering to hear them because of it. It's not because it's a ugly voice. ( Brian Johnson from AC/DC also has an ugly voice, but he could set it into the band's music ). The trouble is that Mustaine doesn't have a clue how to sing !!!! OF course there would be no MEGADETH without Mustaine, but he must recognize the fact that he is one of the worst metal singers ever."
5,SKC Case,"Great case for carrying a Combo-barrel shotgun! Much handier than a hard case at the range, as you can use it to cover your gun in gun racks. Super value compared to others on the market!"
3,"Second in the series, repeats the first.","Enhanced version of the first book (Costuming from the Hip) and not as comprenhensive as the third (Bedlahs, Baubles and Beads) this book is a good beginner's guide to creating belly dance costumes. The information is well laid out and easy to follow with good illustrations where needed. A nice variety of illustration styles throughout helps inspire ideas and the extensive list of resources at the end is a terrific way to round out the book. A good volume for the novice costume maker."
1,shipping rates and poor quality,"This product is made of very thin nylon. The quality is poor. The shipper charged me $22.90 for shipping when the website clearly states that it should have been $7.90, extra for added weight. This is a very light product. I will not order from this shipper again."
4,Good...bad movie,"Interesting little horror flick with decent bad acting and good characters. Story is pretty cool too. Having seen almost every b-movie available on dvd, this one ranks up there pretty high."
1,"Yawn, & a bigger Yawn","OMG, I found this book so boring. I kept listening for awhile, up to Part 2. only because Tavia Gilbert is the narrator. Ms. Gilbert does do an energetic and enthusiastic rendition of what can only be called the most boring book in the world.The author frankly, had a very boring childhood and not even remotely remarkable. Much of it would be more appropriate for the psychiatrist couch not a book. I noticed years ago that the more boring and un-understandable a book is the more the more academic portion of society holds it in high esteem worthy of tearing apart phrase by phrase.Save yourself the wasted time or money and get something interesting to read. Preferably something that has a real story to it not someone's meandering reminiscent of a boring childhood. Growing up in the 50's was not this boring. The only thing that kept me awake was the lovely rendition from Tavia Gilbert."
1,The worst book ever,"I have read this book for my literature class and it was the most dull and most boring book I have ever read. I read an average of about 20 400 page plus books a year and this book isn't even on the list of good ones I've read. The story has absolutely no point and plot and is probably another way for Annie to make a quick buck. I could not put this book down because I wanted the nightmare to finish. Who cares if you collected rocks and labeled them. If you have enough time to do that you have no life. Plus your going to write peices of junk like 'An American Childhood'. If you can't sing then don't sing, if you can't write then don't write. Leave it up to the experts Annie, you can't write."
2,An American Childhood,"As a child who grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa during the timeframe of the book. I was expecting something along the lines of ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash"". Instead I got a self indulgent muse of a pampered life that did not embrace working class Pittsburgh of the 50's and 60's. A great let down."
3,A collage of unusual childhood pictures,"It took me three attempts to finally make it all the way through this book. The problem is not the vignettes, which are often amusing, but the fact that the book lacks cohesion. On the first page of the book, Dillard says, ""the story begins"". But she is wrong. This is not a story. This is a collage, a scrapbook of snapshots from her youth that lacks the unity of a good biography. Many readers of the book enjoyed this sort of format, but I found it prohibitive. Once I finally made it through to the end (on the third try), I enjoyed the experience, but it was a struggle early on in the book to keep going."
1,Terrible,"This book is possibly the worst piece of literature that I have ever read in my lifetime. I do realize that the book is an autobiography and is by no means meant to be an adventure fiction novel. However, if you are going to write about your life, please do something interesting. Nobody wants to hear about an average person leading an average life with no specific events to back it up. Dillard tries to make her life seem interesting by filling the book with useless descriptions and seemingly random transitions. I will keep this book by my bed simply because if I am having trouble sleeping, it will put me right out.Here is a quote to show exactly how disjointed the writing is.""I was hoping the streets would fill and I could shoot my cap gun at people instead of at mere sparrows. My project was to ride my swing all around, over the top. I bounced a ball against the house..."""
5,Damn Funny Stuff,"Just blew threw this is 2 days, one of those 'couldn't put it down' books. Rarely do I laugh, or even chuckle but Mr. Q provided 2 days worth of jollies. Interesting to see how some of these movie moguls have progressed (or degressed) in the few years since the books has been published. If you too feel insulted by what Hollywood offers us as 'entertainment' get this book. Enjoy!!"
2,Attention all MP3 manufacturers,I am writing this reveiw for above product and also all other mp3 players. I bought above product it worked fine for 3 months then it went down. Sound quality was in acceptable limits. Its that you have to try different freequecies to get best sound. One major drawback is that this players starts from song 1 whenever its powered on. So if you are at 100th song and you restarted your car it goes back to song 1. This is a basic/bare bone requirement that most manufacturers fail to specify. Please if you are a mp3 manufacturer tell us if it starts where it stoped last.
4,"A good read, I had trouble putting the book down.","Very enjoyable. Mr. Simmons definitely did his research on the fantastic/scary creatures from many cultures. Solid and well written. I look forward to seeing more work by this author. As a side note, I live in the area where the book takes place and it is indeed spooky to have everything accurately described in vivid detail. You won't be disappointed."
2,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,its so bad its brakeble its no good and you hear way better without it!!!!!!!! i got this for christmas and i dont like it
4,Danceable,"Group formed in the '90s, with musical structure rich in mergers of various rhythms, jazz, swing Funky, very good, happy, danceable."
1,Good product...BAD supplier,Super product....I have three in my laundry room and one in each guest bedroom. They work great to hang throws or even clothes. BUT.....BUYER BEWARE....Look for a different supplier other than ANTonline. Packing on last one of three for my sister's home was so damaged I can't believe they shipped it. Even looked like rats had eaten thru the box. One rod was missing too. I waited beyond 30 day limit to assemble for her so I was out of luck. ANTonline told me to contact manufacturer on warranty card but THAT was missing too.
2,excellent introduction to quantum structures,i read this book and it seems to be very readable. it explains the physics behind the quantum heterostructures in a lucid and tractable manner. i recommend this volume before reading the treatise by weisbach & vinter. those who want to start research on quantum structures will find this book as an invaluable resource. its comprehensive and almost exhaustive.
4,A bit smaller than the pad on my Bosch multitool,"Good product, great price. I have used my Bosch Multitool for a lot of things I never expected to use it for, and these pads are perfect for their intended purpose and at a great price. Just a bit smaller than I expected."
5,Better than the first in the series...,"...and that's saying something, for a trilogy. Most of the time, the second book is the weakest; the author has to raise the stakes, while resolving the present-time problems though not the larger ones. Butcher does an excellent job at this, while developing the characters of the people we met in the earlier novel. He also manages to throw in a few delightful surprises.The end result is a story that I simply kept reading. In fact, I stayed up way too late to finish the book, because I just had to know what happened. And now, alas, I have to wait for book #3!"
4,Better than expected,"I thought this was way better than I expected, after reading some of the reviews.Lots of action and page turning. Tavi and then Isana, win hands down for the book. The characters Bernard and Amana bore me to tears, and their wars go on and on, and forever repeat themselves. I skim their chapters. I don't know why those two cannot interest me, but there you have it.Tavi and his chela! Fantastic! I love Tavi and his development. Can't wait to read the next one."
5,Excellent but for the Sexual Content,"When a mysterious creature from Tavi's past resurfaces and hundreds of people throughout Alera disappear, no one realizes how far the danger has spread till it is almost too late. Academ's Fury introduces us to Tavi in the throes of the political upheaval, treachery, and diplomacy that permeate life in the capital.This fantastic read sucks you in from the beginning and leaves you looking for more pages when it ends. It deals with the complicated issues surrounding loyalty, greater good, sacrifice, and compromise. The reader should be aware that it contains some gruesome violence (arms getting ripped off, people pulverized, etc) as well as some sexuality. The sexuality ranges from suggestive comments, to lead up sequences and is my main angst with the book as it prevents me from recommending it to just anyone."
4,The picking is still the main issue...,"The system is excellent, and the author offers you many combinations to max out the chances of multiple wins for the numbers that you successfully pick... Now there's rub, as Shakespeare said... However brilliant the strategies may be for maxing out the wins for a given number selection (6 for the Lotto 6/49 etc.) you are still left with the problem of picking the RIGHT six numbers.If you use his System 20 and pick 10 numbers, it will max out the wins for any of the 'drawn' numbers from your chosen ten; but as even ten numbers out of 49 still leaves 39 that you didn't choose, the odds on winning are still slim.This is not a criticism of the book whatsoever, I just want potential buyers to understand that this is a way of maxing out any wins that you do get, if you successfully pick e.g. three or more 'drawn' numbers. Instead of winning e.g. $80, you could win $80 three or four times over in the same ticket batch.Good luck..."
1,Being generous with ONE star,OMG....I felt as though the book did not break down the enormous amount of info on the different strategies. SMH
2,"Average game novel, at best","If this were any other type of book it would have failed miserably in ever respect. But you can't hold campy game novels to the same standards you do actual works of literature. Even with this in mind, it's still not a good book. The plot is uneven, with enough holes and nonsensical twists to nearly kill any coherence it might have had were it not for the absolutely godawful exposition. Again, this could be sidestepped, but the central problem is that the author really doesn't demonstrate any knowledge of the Lara Croft character. She's not nearly intelligent enough, and doesn't that that Tomb Raider edge. If the names were changes, the author could have been writing about any female hero on the run. It's really tragic that this is an official book. Kind of a waste, even for a game novel."
4,note that this is the single-line handset,"While the description says this is for 8800 series phones, note that the TRU8866 2-line phone requires the TCX860 handset."
5,Best phone set I've ever owned.,"Love these things. I have 5 handsets so far, and I'm thinking I need two more.I set the banner on each handset to things like ""Kitchen"", ""LivingRoom"", ""MasterBed"", ""Garage1"", etc. Once you do that, you just hit the ""intercom"" button and the list of handsets pops up with the banner names, and you select the appropriate destination by name. Love that. Every handset can be a room monitor by a similiar function.Every handset has a speakerphone function too:) Joy. Easy to use, easy setup. great functionality."
3,OK,"I looked at lots of gates and returned some. This, like all, has a ledge on the bottom that a tot can stand on---not good for those bolts in the wall! They need to make a totally flat gate. Installing is crazy hard; you have to line stuff up. It is at the top of thestairs, and a bit of a hassle to push on, then lift up. Not very easy but OK. It'll keep my baby safe, but I am worried the toddler will break the bolts in the wall."
4,Sturdy and easy to use,"WE bought this gate and it is very sturdy and easy to open with one hand. It would be a 5 star if it was not so hard to install. However, i suggest hiring a professional; it is worth it if you are not handy as ANY gate will not work well if not installed properly."
4,Most solid gate I tried,"I use the gate to keep the two dogs isolated in the kitchen when the house is empty. I first purchased a KidCo gate about 10 years ago for one doorway into the kitchen. At that time I purchased a second gate from a different vendor for another, wider opening into the kitchen. The original KidCo gate is still intact, solid, and is working fine after 10+ years. The second gate broke on a regular basis and was repaired multiple times until it finally became un-repairable. So I replaced it in 2010 with a new KidCo brand gate and extension. I'm happy to say the new KidCo gate is just as sturdy as the 10+ year old one. It is a pleasure to have a sturdy gate that will also likely last 10+ years. The difference between the two gate brands is in the mounting hardware. The gates themselves were essentially the same, welded steel bars. But, the KidCo gate had much sturdier, much higher quality mounting hardware. That meant we could use the gate for 10+ years without any problems at all."
1,Not practical,Not easy to open and close when you are carrying a baby up and down the stairs. It's not very satable and secure.
5,"After trying several, this is the one + exc customer service!","I installed two other brands of safety gates and was thoroughly frustrated with them...one in particular required both hands to operate (meaning I had to set down everything I was carrying to operate the gate), yet my young child figured out how to defeat it easily!Finally I tried the Kidco Safeway and...it just works. Easy for an adult to get through, tough for a kid to defeat, easy to install, all metal, sturdy, and low profile.At one point we moved and I lost an essential piece of hardware for the gate. I called Kidco, they shipped it quickly and at no charge. How rare is that? Kudos to this company."
2,"Loved it, Until my 11 month old learned how to unlock it himself!","When we first put this gate up, I thought it was great and for the first month saw no problems at all. But, after only a month, my 11 month old son has learned where to push to unlock it. He has never actually opened it up on his own, but he has unlocked it (I always get to him before he pushes it open. We will be removing this gate and finding one that he would not be able to open on his own, since that's pretty much the point!"
4,"liked this product, bought two!",Came in great condition. I purchased one a few months prior to test it out and liked it so much I purchased the second. My dogs figured out how to pop it open thankfully my toddler has not!
5,"Top-notch, durable gate--used for 5 1/2 years","This gate was a champ. Survived two kids and daily opening and closing. Just took it down today because our youngest is now quite capable on the stairs. It does take a little time to install, but I think most attached gates would. You have to align everything. It does have a template to help with that process. Also, the latch is too tricky for a smart toddler (aren't they all clever) to figure out. Impressed with quality of materials, durability."
5,this is a great book!,i really liked this book!i think it was a great tale of a lttle field mouse who has to move her family.her youngest son timothy is struck with pnemonia and he can not be out in the open air.she meets the rats of NIMH and they make a plan to move her house.she is trapped and is afraid the plan will not work.she is freed and the plan works as they wished it would.this is a great book and i recommend this to anyone from the age 8 and up!i also think that if you get the chance that you should see the movie secret of NIMH.that is just what i think...now you read it and see if you enjoy it as much as i did.
5,An Instant Classic!,"This is one of the most enthralling books that I have ever read (this includes adult books also). I have read it many times since I first did five years ago. I think that all parents should read this novel to their children, or the should encourage them to read the book themselves. It is a book that will never be forgotten and will, perhaps, encourage the reading of many more books in the future. It will hopefully be available for many years to come."
5,A very exciting book,I like this book because it's hiliarious in some parts and then it's serious. The auther makes this book suspensful beacuse he leaves you cliff hanging. I would recomend this book to 3-12 grades.
5,Some thing about moving,"I really enjoy Robert o'Brien books. I really enjoyed this book because I really liked how Mrs. Frisby helped the rats through the duct work. It must be frustrating for her, and how she helped the rats move her house. If you like rats or mice this is a book for you!! Oh yea the main thing that is the problem is that Mrs. Fribsy has to move her house before Spring."
4,Mrs. Frisby and the rats of NIMH,Mrs. Frisby and the rats of Nimh*Mrs. Frisby seeks help to try to cure Timothy. Timothy comes down with pneumonia and if a slight of cold air gets into Timothy's lungs he could die. The book was a race against time. It is spring time and the field needs to be ready for plating.My favorite part was when the rats moved the cinder block. It was very intense. I would change the ending. I would say who the two rats that died.I give this book 4 stars out of 5. I don't give this book 5 stars because I didn't like the ending. It left off alot of description. For example: We don't know who the two rats that died were. Be sides that the book was really good.
4,Wonderful Children's book to be enjoyed through your adult years,This book is a wonderful story of adventure and bravery. Highly recommended for readers of any age.
2,Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of Nimh,I dont really like this book because its to old of a setting and it really isnt acitting to read. You get board really fast. They should of made more adventureous and should make one point to the story like u find the cure 4 Timothey or a story how you find the new home they need to surrvive.
4,What goes around...,"A mid-70s Newbery winner, and a bit of a surprise to me. I wasn't expecting something I liked from the spin passage on the back. After giving it the couple of dozen pages I'd allowed as a try, I found myself wanting to keep going. It turns out that Mrs. Frisby joins mice Stuart Little and Ralph S. Mouse as an engaging character. The rats she deals with take on almost science fiction aspects, as escapees from a successful run in a scientist's lab. They work with Mrs. Frisby to their mutual benefit through a number of challenges. Bottom line, I liked it enough to finish it fast. I think girls would identify with Mrs. Frisby enough to take a lot of pleasure in the story, and boys will appreciate the action and danger and various male characters in the story. The themes of altruism coming back, what goes around coming around, is a good one to encourage acts of kindness in the children. It would be a good read aloud, and a good book for intermediate grades or middle school."
5,Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you are a 9 year old girl like me I think you should read this because it is exciting and there is lots of fun and adventure.
4,I give a thumbs up!,"I was oly in secont grade when I red this book, and that's pretty good, but I loved it so much! It is about a mouse, who goes to a communtity of rats (the rats of NIMH) for help, becouse her child is utterly sick."
3,A good book,"Mrs. Frisby and the rats of nimh is a great book. I like it because each chapter makes you wonder what will happen next. The auther uses personification so it is cool that it has an animal's perspective. I rate this book a three because it is not a bad book, but it is not the best book I have ever read. It is a great book. I think anyone would like it if they wanted a good book to read."
4,A must read for everyone,"Michael Dallen's book, ""The Rainbow Covenant"" is a must read for everyone. I have studied ""The Seven Law's of Noah"" for several years and have found Michael Dallen's books a great read for both the novice and the serious student. This book is both wide in scope and inclusive. You do not need to be a religious person to read ""The Rainbow Covenant"" for it is the stuff that nations are build on."
1,Very bad experience.,"The Panasonic ""Compact Fax and Digital Answering System (KX-FP145) is defective and your supplier - Shoplet - refuses to replace same with a unit which works. Spent two hours on the phone with a Panasonic Tech. Rep.who could not fix the unit's deficiency (extremely light printing image). She advised I return the unit to the supplier who - presumably - would send me a replacement. Shoplet advised they would not cooperate as it was ten days beyond their shipping date (April 7, 2009) so I am stuck with a defective unit. Please advise."
3,so so,"not really into this movie.sounds silly i don't like it .since i just rent it doesn't mind ,pass ,onya !"
1,trash,"If you like punk, you'll hate this garbage. A total mess, and not in a good way. Throw any copies you find laying around in the trash and be done with it."
1,not ready for prime time,"I would not recommend Bio Drive yet. the technology is not quite ready for mass use. difficulty recognizing fingerprints. had to use rescue password, which my unit forgot. Since I already had secure work data on it, I did not want to return it as that was the tech support solution. So I am out $125."
4,Great book but Kindle version not best for group study,I'm kind of new to Kindle but other books I've read have page numbers at the bottom. This book doesn't so is hard to follow in study with others using hard copy. The book itself is exceptional. Well researched and supported by scripture. Definitely the authority on Elder led church polity. A great resource for anyone considering serving as an elder or those who already are elders. Very helpful for churches considering elder leadership too.
3,An opinion.,"Most of the teaching in this book was helpful in pulling out the scriptures which related to a particular subject heading. However, the author's interpretation of the scriptures and understanding of the culture during the times the scriptures were written was, in many places, poor.The chapter about leadership being male was interesting. He really had to go round the houses to justify what he believed.This book is one man's interpretation and opinion, and should be read as such."
4,Biblical elderships,This book tells how to divide a church against itself through the use of grandruerious leaders. An excellent read for megalomanical pastors. A must read for all Christians.
3,Already Dated,"These DVD's are already dated! ""Inside Air Force One"" and ""Inside the White House"" are both back in the Clinton era, and there is much too much fawning about Bill and Hillary. ""Inside the Pentagon"" is more recent, however it is well before the Second Gulf War, and the revolutions that that war has seen in the area of freeing a country without destroying its civilian population or destroying its intrastructure. While these DVD's are appropriate for children, they are too dated for most adults."
3,Not great,"This was a required text in medical school. It is long on text & short on illustrations, which I personally find uninviting so I did not use it as a go-to reference.[...]"
3,Good but fragmented,"I have to say I was disappointed in this book; enough so that I returned both copies I'd bought (one for me and one for a gift).There are some good tips in it for dealing with common ADD challenges, but I found them hard to reference, even though they're grouped into chapters based on topic. And when I'd try to read straight through like a regular book, I'd find myself becoming overwhelmed by all the varying tips (how very ADD of me). If, instead of writing in sound bytes, more had been written about each tip, I think I would have appreciated it more.Anyway, having said that, it does have some good basic hints and tips, especially for newly diagnosed ADDers."
3,Where's the early stuff?,"To call this ""essential"" would be likened to editing a good book & saying you were getting only the ""essential"" stuff. ""Essential"" in who's opinion? While this does concentrate on his big mega hits, where are the early songs that made him big such as ""Mexican Joe"" & ""Bimbo""? As short of a running time as this has, BMG should be ashamed of themselves. We need a volume 2 to concentrate on the early stuff!"
3,good but there's better,"I've been looking for some good teagarden songs, these songs are good but there are better, and i've almost given up looking for songs of the quality that i found on a jack teagarden - red nichols and his five pennies/ orchestra record that i found recently. It includes songs like "" that's the kind of girl for me"" and "" I'm one of gods children"" , "" Smiles"" , ""Keep a song in your soul"", and more which i do admit to seeing on other cd's available now, such as beale street blues. But nothing compares to these songs that i've mentioned, The record companies should re- publish more material around 1929-1935 cause that's where the real great stuff is concentrated. if anyone is interested in learning more about these songs don't hesitate to contact me, on sean_vb@excite.com or the link with my name."
4,get inside someone's head,"Don't expect this to be explicit erotic writing. Some of it is. But really, if you find intelligence, emotions, and digging into someone's past as related to their own current secrets and fantasies, it's really very sexy. The stories are wonderful gems (some better than others) that seem to intertwine with each other the further you get along. There's no set cast of characters, other than what goes on in the deep dark recesses of the author's brain. Do you want to go there? Be sure, because you'll be confronting an eroticism you weren't even sure you had yourself."
2,haven't finished it,"be prepared that most of (but not all of) the stories are fantasy (made up lands and places or dream, etc), and not realistic....probably a lovely collection if that's what you're looking for. also, mine was bound up-side-down and backwards....anyone elses???"
1,Sorry I Listened...,"I always read the customer reviews of books before I buy them here. And as always I did the same for this book. The reviews were great!! I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Wow, what an absolute dissappointment. The stories were tedious and boring. Almost everything in that book could have been written by the same author. Even some of the same exact phrasing and scenery description was used in several different stories. It really made for dull, repetitive reading."
1,Another Extremely BAD Zombie Movie!,"I was highly disappointed by this movie. They don't even show the zombies toward the end of the movie, and the movie doesn't even seem to be about zombies. It's about these college students going to an abandoned house were some killings took place to learn about birds. NOT COOL!!!"
4,question,"before I purchase, I am unclear whether there Is there sanskrit text in this book, roman transliteration, or both? can someone please let me know?"
5,"A Fortunate ""Accident""","I bought this book on vacation. I'm a person that frequently judges books by their covers and this one looked interesting. If it weren't good, it would be cute on my bookselves later. I read it in about 5 large chunks spread out over 3 days. Got a little preoccupied by it to be quite honest. It drew me right in.I've reccommended it since to friends who have all thanked me. It has a lot going for it: history, personality, humor, honesty, insight. Memoirs are hit or miss, but Matthew Chapman is a genuinely intruiging person. What is different about this memoir is that it wasn't intended to be one. The author realized ultimately though, that his own story is the one that should be told. He wrote it with a sense of humor, candidness, perspective, and without being self-indulgent. It's a great, well-written story."
5,Fox Run Cork Puller,"Great product. Rocking cork puller into bottle neck, twist and pull takes corks out with ease. No more half corks left in bottles. This puller does not expand the cork allowing one to put the cork back in the neck of the bottle with ease."
1,A waste of time & money,The assembly instructions are a nightmare. The light does not work despite pulling out and removing the tab as directed. Cute idea but it's a poorly constructed toy. Just glad that I tried it out before having a very disappointed 9 yr old on Christmas. Returning it tomorrow for a more durable toy.
5,Jump start your busness brain,"We run a corporate learning center in rural Nova Scotia . Getting our message out as always been difficult. I have read many marketing books by academics Jump Start your Business Brain is not only the best book on marketing I have ever read it also has research and the the entrepreneurial methods of how to do it. It's fantastic I am just reading it for the second time. I would highly recommended it to anyone who wants to "" to win more, lose less, and make more money. Charles Bower Ledgehill"
5,Filled with VALUABLE information,"This book is AWESOME!! I'm an architect so I have close zero to no marketing background. For me the value of this book has been immense! The study cases he presents, the practical tactics, the way he explains things has been eye opening. I do believe this book covers very basic stuff! So if you're looking for a more in depth reading on marketing you probably might want to look elsewhere. But for someone who is just beginning to get in the marketing theme, i believe, this book is a MUST!!"
5,A Must Read for ALL Small Businesses,"Through Jump Start Your Business Brain Doug has enabled Small/Mid-Sized businesses to steal shamelessly from the Fortune 500 corporations. The principles he discovered could increase the probability of any business's success. It's a well written book with plenty of real life examples. Doug, thanks for being a friend to small businesses."
1,Peice of...,"I'm almost posative the guy who wrote the first reveiw for this works for the company, there is no way this peice of rubbish can be compared to the miraculous peice of equipment in the first review.Its very uncomfortable to wear and you can't adjust it for size at all, it struggles to work in almost all light conditions, in FPS its horribly jumpy and slow to respond to your movments and shots."
4,Unexpected Treasure,"After the disappointing ""Left Behind-The Movie"" and the ""Noah"" fiasco, I was a little cautious in purchasing this video. But the videos in this series have proven that there are excellent quality, biblical, movies available. I was very pleased with how close the director walked with Scripture. I wasn't certain upon viewing the movie so I had to go back and check for myself. Solomon never married the Queen of Sheba. Solomon just gave her whatever she wanted and she simply went home (I Kings 10:13). But I understand the desire to read a little romance into the story. It helped me realize that it's still ""Hollywood"" and helped me research a little more. I can't complain about that.Overall this was an excellent movie! It's a good way to spend a few relaxing hours. Ben Cross was convincing as the ""king with many wives"" and Vivica's eyes worked perfectly behind the veil. Hard to resist. Great series! Great movie!"
1,"Very upset to hear ""God's voice"" as a little girls.","I pulled out Jeremiah first. I am extremely upset, and will watch more to comment later. I bought this a couple of years ago I believe. Surprised that there were no ratings speaking about more than just ""license"". Where on earth does God present himself as a little girl's voice? In Benny Hinn's bedroom while he seeing little angels and/or describing us as ""little gods""? I have to say I am dismayed (although it is what we are to expect), of the amount of false Biblical portrayals and books. I'll give some more info later."
3,the movie was okay but not all that great....,this movie has some exposed body parts on it that i didnt like and it showed alot of intimate scenes which i think they should of left out. Me being a christian dont think that it is good to see some of the scenes like that on there. warning all christians that this movie is okay but not good for the kids to watch.
3,Nice Collection of her Work,"Nice CD, have been looking for the original to no avail. Great thing about this CD is you get two albums for the price of one. It is some classic impossible to find songs on here. Worth the price and a nice CD to put on to take your friends way back. They will ask ""where in the hell did you find that"". Another plus is Mrs. Simpson explaining her life story and writing a little bit about the history and her thoughts on each song. No artist does that anymore. A very nice CD for your collection."
5,Simply Amazing,"Valerie Simpson is a diva, and her music speaks for itself. I loved Collection, and I just wished Valerie had released more solo material.Great Job!!"
5,Filled in a nice gap I was missing in WFRP,"Great sourcebook for me. I love the explanation of a Dwarf Hold and the surrounding city that grew up around. I knew of Kara Azgal from playing a ""Mordheim"" scenarios and this sourcebook brought the place even more to life. Additionally it provides some real nice stuff on dungeon delving. Something I have done in D&D stuff, but not very much in Warhammer. In fact I plan to use Karak Azgal to start a new campaign with a bunch of d20 players. They will be a bit familiar with dungone delving and will allow them to transition into the game easier."
2,?Que qu? vio la mujer de Lot?,"La verdad es que como no vale la pena este libro les dar? la respuesta: nadie sabe lo que vio mas que ella misma.El principo del libro es interesante pues habla de la vida extraterrestre (si es que existe) y de como ?sta estuvo presente en el principio de la vida del Hombre, yo no digo que no exista vida fuera de la Tierra, pero todas las teor?as del escritor se basan en los rusos, el libro fue escrito en los setentas y en 2004 ya sabemos que la mitad de las investigaciones rusas fueron inventadas, pues tambi?n sabemos que en Marte no hay vida ni hojas ni nada, cosa que los rusos y el escritor afirmaban en 1975.?Por qu? no se bas? el escritor en la NASA??De d?nde decidi? el escritor que los rusos eran los de mejor tecnolog?a cuando ahora sabemos que no es cierto?Definitivamente este libro hab?a que leerlo antes de los ochenta y lo m?s recomendable ahora seria quemarlo."
2,Not What I Expected,"Unlike most sf novels, more character development here. Unfortunately that is about all I can say for this book which was a great disappointment. We are presented with the existence of an alien being early in the novel and then not much happens and the ending is unspectacular."
5,It sooooo hard to find it,"You can find other nations such USA, cuba, mexican, and other latin american nations that played in the WBC. But for those Asian nations, it is hard to find. It took me a lot of time to find it eventually. The quality is as good as other New Era products."
2,Cheap yet Decent,"I wanted a pair just to supplement ear buds at work - I hate eating or talking while wearing ear buds - so these at least give you ability to hear some surroundings. They do have an ""hear the ocean"" negative - they are Tinny - too much treble but they are big enough to wear for hours - they might be a bit quiet - I noticed I have to turn ipod volume way up, to get right MIX. Good for the price though"
2,Broke and Can't Afford Headphones?,"Hey maybe you don't have a lot of money, but don't throw it away on these headphones. They are poor sound quality and generally I love Sony products. For about ten dollars more you can get the Sony 200's which I DO recommend. But if you are really strapped for cash I would recommend getting the mini Panasonic with bass ports or some other smaller headphone meant for portable CD players, MP3's, or iPod's and use those. Mini headphones are the way to go with an adapter at this price range IMHO."
2,not a good deal,"at first time I was excited with the price and apparently the product...When I got I first realize that the wire is really too long, good to use at home, make you able to walk around, but extremily exagerate when you are using ion your mp3 player...the sound is clear but to low...sometimes, mainly on the street you want more volume and can not get it!the isolation also not good there is no isolation...and the plastic is resistent but very simple and not what you expet from as sony product...I do recomend to add 10 dolars more and buy other headphone as I did one month later!"
2,Why would anyone buy these?,"I bought these because I trust Sony quality and because they seemed like a good deal at $17.99. However, I am anxiously awaiting another set of headphones to replace these after just a month. I need some sturdy headphones for my daily 45-minute bus ride. I thought the big cups on these would block some of the noise around me. The weird thing is, it actually amplifies it. Put these headphones on and you can hear a conversation two rows back on the bus that before you would not have even noticed. It's sort of like listening into a seashell. I hate these headphones and I will stomp them to death as soon as a replacement arrives. They are not particularly uncomfortable, but I have grown to hate them with a passion in only two weeks. The cord is really really long and will not even stay in a tight knot. Good non-tangle headphones. Bad-usability headphones."
1,I hate these things.,"The design of these is like a sick practical joke. They are very uncomfortable and feel like they're about to slip at any second no matter how you adjust them. Any slight movement of the head causes a ""Uh-oh!"" feeling like they're gonna slide off and if you do actually lay back or bend over, they fall off. Add to that the fact that they don't block any surrounding noise and people around you can hear what you're listening to and this product just fails, fails, fails.Total junk. All that + they don't have any bass and sound like pop garbage."
2,Excellent sound while they still worked.,"I'm not sure how to feel about these. Hopefully I just got a defective pair, because the sound was fantastic for all of about three weeks before the left channel stopped working completely, and the glue holding the input jack in place was found to be falling apart."
2,Cheap...,"Do not trust reviews... I searched all over the internet for some nice headphones, came to decide on these after... all I can say is cheap. The headphones are flimsy, its a plus because they don't push against your head, Which brings me to my next point. Absolutely no noise canceling with these, it actually echoes... very annoying. The chord can be a plus because its 11.5 ft.... What can I say, I got what I paid for.... $20..."
2,poor sound quality,i really like the lengthy cable but i hate the sound quality of this ear phone .It has ZERO BASS.I think it filters the bass in the music and delivers a low bass audio quality.
4,Basic but brilliant,"These headphones are a bargain for what they offer. The overall range is excellent. They are light, but robust enough for regular abuse.I know these aren't high-end, super-expensive audiophile gear, but for those on a budget these will get you by very nicely. I mostly use it for watching TV or for computer applications. I'm sure they are adequate for most folks. If you're doing musical recording, that would require an upgrade."
3,ok but on a good price,"I was excited to get this headphones and when I finally got them I was a little disappointed,the comfort is outstanding ,but the bass is not as good unless your watching a movie ,but when I plug it to my I pod it doesn't really hit the deep notes and I'm a big bass lover so I was a little sad to find this out ,but overall the price for these handphones were outstanding and the extra long cord can be a pain sometimes ,I had to have it tied up in order for it not to drag on the floor."
2,Pretty low quality,"Sound quality is pretty low on these, and they feel a bit cheap. To be honest I was surprised that these were Sonys."
5,rurouni kenshin fans listen up cause you'll love this anime!,"WOW!!!! Samurai Deeper Kyo! What can I say! It¡s definitely a five star anime! There¡s romance, sword fights, ninjas, comedy, drama and much much more. The characters are well developed and drawn so superbly. The animation is top notch. The music is just really awesome. There¡s something for everybody. The story line is somewhat similar to rurouni kenshin¡s yet it still has a story of its own. [...]. Well it gets greater every episode. Like I said, this is something for everyone and even if you don¡t like samurais and fighting, you¡ll definitely enjoy this series!!! I¡ve said enough so now that you heard so much about it, go out and buy it! I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!"
2,Good concept but lacking,I've had this for a couple of months now and I have to agree with the previous reveiwer... the phone does occassionally come out if you're not careful. I have a pretty fat phone too...LG VX8100. The headset has come out a couple times as well so I've gotten used to push it all the way down. You just have to really be careful. I just don't know of another case out there that holds your phone and your headset though.
5,Red Hot Early Jazz,"Back in 1926 and 27, when these recordings were laid down, jazz was fresh and exciting, the exploration of a musical world of freedom. More than anything, I love the sound of musicians quite literally playing their way through this sort of journey."
1,Please don't waste your money,"This did nothing to deter my cats. I bought this and the diffuser, neither provided any results. The spray leaves my walls sticky, and the smell is low, but unpleasant. Please don't waste the money."
5,Experiments in Terror,"Henry Mancini is a musical genious!!!!!This boxset is pure Mancini bliss. My favorite song of his is Experiments in Terror. jamie smith band plays that song every night to start out our show. We realize it goes over most people's heads but we use it to set the mood and pay tribute to the master. We also sat around a fireplace, each with one of the 3 discs for this set and wrote a song called Mancini. I can't say enough good things about him. From his days playing piano for Glen Miller to Charlies Angels, this cat has covered it all. I wish I could've seen him live because there's no one like him before or since."
3,The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz,"This encylcopedia was a huge and expensive dissapointment. If you are not a jazz freak with 1 million cd-s, you wan't find this peace all that very usefull. I mean, the article about chet baker is only twice as long as the article on chave baker, cheese baker and other non relevant bakers. This is advanced guide for real experts. On the top of it, all articles are dull written, not even close to a readable and interesting biographies of people but only as a list of information, many of which is not very usefull. Some hints about nightclubs are good, but that couldAvoide it....."
2,Readings are substantially irregular...,"I agree completely with the previous review. It looks really nice, but I could get the exact same reading three times in a row and then 15 minutes later have a reading a pound or more different. I really can't even imagine why this would be. Its gonna end up being a tinkering project to figure out the problem sooner than I will bother sending it back... =P"
1,Too big for any normal sink.,"I ordered this soap dish because I badly needed one, but when it arrived, not only was it cracked, but the things is monstrously huge. I can't forsee a time when anyone would have a sink big enough for this thing. No. Wait, I guess you could use it if you typically have 2-3 different types of soap in use at the same time. If you're that person, this dish is for you. If you'll be using it for one bar, look somewhere else."
2,soap dish not well constructed,The base separated from the top and had to be reglued immediately after setting it up; clumsy on the counter; water spots on metallic base make it look sloppy.Delivered on time and in good condition.
2,Not Branded to Kill,"This is one of two films that I regret buying. I bought it because it is a ""spiritual sequel"" to Branded to Kill, which I felt was a pretty good assassin movie with just a couple incoherent scenes. But this is way more nonsensical than Branded, it barely has a plot. This movie seems like just an excuse for the director to film a plethora of what he thinks are ""interesting"" scenes; including one with guys in the background wearing sarongs, covered in grey paint that are not even acknowledged. Yep, that had zero relevance to any part of the story.The only positive things about Pistol Opera are; one or two cool scenes (i.e. Stray Cat's assassination at the pool and part of her gunfight with the blonde guy), the movie's theme song and some of the characters are kinda cool too. This could have been an updated, modern day Branded to Kill, but is just another ridiculously wacky Japanese movie."
5,16 bucks for a saw'sall,$16 bucks for a saw'sall thing works great uses the same blades as every other saw.
3,Very Nice,"I liked this chair cover very much, although I thought it was made of cloth, but it fit in my chair and it will decorate my halloween party perfectly!"
3,If you like American history you will enjoy this read,Mallon gives a glimse of life during one of the most crucial periods in American history. I came away from this book understanding a great deal more about the Civil War era. Although I wasn't particularly fond of the characters involved I found the story very intersting and entertaining.
2,"Good Plot, Bad Ending","The book, Henry and Clara, written by Thomas Mallon, is about the couple who sat with the Lincolns on the night of Abraham Lincoln's assasination. Lovers from the ages of young teenagers, the basic plot is about Henry and Clara trying to convince Clara's father for them to marry, while Ira Harris (father) keeps putting it off longer and longer.The basic plot of this book was very imaginative and could be useful to people curious about Lincoln's assasination, though it lacked depth. In some parts of the book, it was horribly slow, and most of the military information really was not necessary. In the end, Thomas Mallon was most likely trying to speed up the writing process to get his book off to the publisher because the ending was the worst I have ever read IN MY LIFE.Though it was a fairly decent plot, it would be stretching the limits to give this book a rating of any more than a three because of the dullness in parts, occasional lack of description and terrible ending."
2,Not Really about Umbrella Mike - Title is a misnomer,"I picked up this book because the title and description on the back cover make it sound like it is about a gangster's life style and his interest in the Indy 500. While there is a wisp of a thread that runs through the book about Mike Boyle and his interest in the race, the book is more about the early years of the Indy 500. It goes through the winners of each year in a repetitive fashion in a manner that 5 chapters could easily be condensed to one. There are also a number of sentences that are repeated, nearly word for word, over and over in several different chapters that lends the book a redundancy of thought. Specifically note the references every few chapters about WWII.If you are a big fan of Indy Racing, there are some interesting facts (not necessarily enough to warrant reading this book), but if you seek history on a gangster life style, skip this book. The rating of 4.5 stars on Amazon (Aug 09) is definitely overrated."
2,Just a little sticky,I like the grit; but the sticky side was only a little sticky and parts wouldn't stick at all. I ended up glueing parts of the sandpaper where I needed it to stick on.
1,Was not as advertised on specification sheet,The product specifications was listed as silicon carbide( a premium abrasive). It was actually aluminum oxide ( a lower grade abrasive). Vendor claimed it was equivalent. They continure to incorrectly advertise a material they can not supply
3,Not as soft as I thought it would be....,I'm a side sleeper and my hip still aches with this pad. I had to also top it with a fiber fill topper. Much better now. Can you believe I supposedly have a plush mattress? My bad for not buying a sleep number...
1,Disappointing,I think there must be something wrong with me. I thought I was a 'die-hard' Sandra Brown fan but that is gradually changing. I have yet to read one of her mysteries which I enjoyed--they go on and on and don't say anything. Exclusive was worse than Mirror Image and I thought that was bad. They're just not believable. Give me the old-fashioned simple romance novels any day. Exclusivedid not fit together--it was unreal and boring. No romance--none!! Comparing it to Patterson is really stretching 'it'.I have Witness--hope it will be a pleasant change from her mysteries I've read up to this point.
1,Exclusive,"The book shipped pretty quick. The condition of this book is unexceptable. It is dirty, and sticky and we intend to just throw it away."
4,Happy and upbeat walking tunes!,"This CD has a young, and fun upbeat feeling to it. I will use it while walking to ""keep up the pace""!"
2,Bummed Out,"Got it for the kids, remembering it from my youth. This version is too cheap to be any fun. The bowler drifts off the lane before he gets the pins, every time. The kids quickly lost interest and it was relegated to the bottom of the toy box in short order."
5,The only ex-Can Member who still sounds like CAN.,I've seen Damo Suzuki twice & he absolutely gives his all live. Both times he played for about 2 & 1/2 hours & was absolutely soaked in sweat afterward yet went around & hugged audience members during the encore. A brilliant vocal improviser he sings mostly in nonsense stream of consciessness type lyrics. Anyway great melodic repetetive rock ala early CAN when Damo was in them. If you like that you'll like this.
1,Garbage,"Same thing happened to me as the other review mentioned, after 3 weeks of use. Contacted Amazon and they send me a new one. So far so good, but it sounds like it isn't going to last.Update. This one lasted a bit longer, a month and a half. It's total junk. Get one made out of metal."
5,Best of the best,"This has to be the best book Robin Jarvis has ever written. A fascinating look at the Elizabethan period as a whole and key figures within that time as well as a marvellous fantasy novel. The main character is an alien from another world, but few aliens are easier to identify with. He is seemingly perfect and wins the adoration of the villagers he meets but deep down is flawed and faulted. Adam o' the Cogs, the novels main child character, is also well drawn, being a welcome change from the standard 'cipher' characters of young adult fiction. The supporting cast is odd, likeable and occasionally dislikable. As usual Robin Jarvis illustrates himself and the quality of the drawing is even higher than usual.An ultra-recommended read."
5,This Band is Killer!,"Thank God (or Satan) for this band! They blend a punkish / metal sound that reminds me of The Ramones, Brides of Destructin, and early Motley. Great guitars! It's a nice break from all the ""New Metal"" [...]. I hope they are around for a long time. They could save Rock-N-Roll. Do yourself a favor. Pick up a case of beer, crank it loud, ENJOY!"
1,Never Came Through,"I ordered this item from THE FACTORY DEPOT and was given a conformation. Yet a whole 13 days later I was sent an email informing me that the item I had purchased was out of stock. I realize that many of these companies have massive inventories and may not be aware the second that an item goes out of stock, but really it took you two weeks to notice? Subsequently I had to reorder the item from another retailer and at best will get it three weeks or so after I originally ordered it. Lastly, I find it amazing that companies never forget to bill you, they only forget to send you the product you purchased. Yay free market enterprise!"
1,Trash...Sound Quality and Quality of Product,These headphones feel as if they were stamped from one piece of thin plastic. They are pure plastic with the exception of the ear area which feels like a thin plastic bag filled with cotton. Sound quality was not any better. They just did not feel like Sony quality at all...not sure if Sony is going cheep on us or what but avoid these cans like the plague.
4,"Good Sound Quality, Low Price Excellent deal","These headphones are really comfortable and come at an affordable price. Best used for I pods, Mp3 players and listening to songs and they come with big puffy comfortable head cushions.Overall I would rate them 8/10. Not the perfect headphones overall but definitely good quality sound.Pros:1)A 10 foot long cord and could be better used if you are an active Gaming person.2)Presence of miniJack.3)Low price for good sound quality.Cons:1) Being so big, you would warrant second-looks whenever you use them outside( on the street or subway rides). I usually use them at home or at work.2)Even though there is a small switch for different modes there is not any majorly noticeable difference between music and movie mode with the small exception that movie has a bit more bass."
4,Pretty good for the price,"Excellent sound quality/utility for the price. Durable and COMFORTABLE construction. Thick wire so it ain't cheap and won't twist and rip. Comes with a adapter so you could plug it into your keyboard, sound system, DJ Turntable systems, etc. Or you could not use the adapter and just plug it into your PC or any 3.5 mm jack.I'd recommend 100% to get this if you just need some affordable and quality headphones you can use ANYTIME."
4,"Sounds Great, Warms Ears","These headphones sound great but they do tend to heat up your ears after about half an hour wearing time. Great value for the money, otherwise."
5,Awesome Headphones!!!,"I had a pair of HD202 headphones that didn't permit me to wear them for more than an hour or so. I let my brother try them on too, we both thought the part pushing against our ears was causing pain so I threw those away. After reading reviews I brought these for $22, and I'm not disappointed. The ear portion of the cuffs encircle your entire ear so there is nothing to pressure your ears and cause pain like other headphones with smaller ear cuffs.I'd easily rate the comfortability of these as a 9/10 out of 10. Sound quality is fine for standard headphones. If you're looking for something cheap, yet durable and comfortable these will work."
3,way too big!! Good only for giants!,"This headphones are way too big for my head, I look like an alien with them lol. I guess for people with a big head it shouldnt be that bad.other than that, the sound and confort are quite good."
4,Good for the Price,"Bought this to use with my 5 string bass Guitar.....this is perfect for what I wanted, some static here and there when you move around but overall its good"
4,DESCRIPTION SONY MDR- XD200 HEADPHONES,THE HEADPHONES ARE FAIRLY GOOD. THEY DO HOWEVER NOT SHUT OUT THEOUTSIDE SOUNDS AS I EXPECTED. I DO ENJOY USING THEM OFTEN. THANKSD.LANDSBERGEN
4,"Pretty Good, But Didn't Block Out Any Noise","I bought this to be able to listen to music in relative quiet at work. The sound was pretty good, much better sense of the music than you get with iPod earbuds and the like. It also doesn't have the huge bulky look of a lot of over-the-ear headphones have. But, in its ability to block out noise I was pretty disappointed."
3,"Nice cans, bad sound","Nice big comfy cans. They are light weight, fit over my big ears and don't touch, well suspended by the adjustable strap. Extended wearing is quite nice. Best for the buck as far as this is concerned.They sound like shit. Lows are not existent, mids are muddy, highs are sharp. Basically they sound bad.Verdict: For 30 bucks, they are 'aight. I wear them at work to drown out office noise, don't worry about them getting stolen."
2,not studio quality,"if you're looking for studio headphones or any headphones to listen to metal music to, stay away. these are probably the worst headphones i have ever used. they're fine for listening to podcasts or youtube videos but completely useless when listening to music. do i regret this purchaseyes,I do"
3,"Great sound, but no sound protection.","Comfortable with great sound. I was trying to save a few bucks hoping that large pads would block outside noise. Do not use these for ""monitoring"" purposes."
1,Simply awful... buy the Sennheiser!,"I am a huge Sony guy, but these are some of the worst headphones I have tried. The bass is often overwhelming, the construction is shoddy at best, the plastic cheap and uncomfortable, and they are UGLY! They are huge and don't adjust well. The sound switch on the ears is foolish and useless (makes no difference). They are extremely uncomfortable, especially on the top of the head. I returned these and bought the latest Sennheiser HD202 headphones which blow these away for about the same price.BUY SENNHEISER HD202 instead!!! Trust me!Sennheiser HD 202 HeadphonesI love your TVs, cameras, PS3, and laptops Sony... but you dropped the ball on these!"
4,Value headphone for semi-serious listening,"Bought for semi-serious listening at home - not to real audio system, but to MP3 files. It's certainly not ideal format to start with, but that's the reality. Initially I was shooting for Sony MDR-V6, but after reading T. Woodard's review I decide to give it a try. Quality is OK, plastic parts looks cheap, and the pads are probably not gonna make it to 2 years if used daily.There's great soundstaging (good for watching video I guess), and tonal envelopes between instruments are clearly articulated. Volume response at every frequency is neutral and even. Bass is clear, no enhancement distortion, but higher frequency is definitely kind of muddy, at least to my taste. Again my quick fix is to boost frequencies over 4k a bit thru EQ, which brings better balance to its relatively undistorted bass.Overall I'll say it's great value, but there's only so much you can get. Hence the 4 stars."
2,You get what you pay for,"Well for $20 I shouldn't have expected much. But most of the reviews here were so positive I just couldn't resist. What have I got to lose? With taxes shipping and handling...about $25.The construction of the headset is very flimsy, almost toy like. But thats ok, if handled with care they could still be servicable for some time. The real problem was with the sound quality. My intended use was for late night TV watching. But the bass frequencies are so muddy and rumbling it was annoying to listen to and made voices almost unintelligeble(sp)."
2,Looks & Brand names can be decieving,"I bought this headphone last week. I was really excited to see a Sony muffler headphone so cheap. I have worked in professional studio in past and I know what a great quality headphone sounds like, obviously it would be dumb of me to compare it with such a headphone, BUT before i bought these headphones i was using headphones by ""Cyber Acoustics"" which probably cost $ 15 aprox, and honestly they have a better sound, a little more comfortable as well. I have no idea why the button for movie and music is there it doesn't change the frequencies a bit.Some people mentioned trouble using it with glasses, i wear glasses but there was not so much of trouble, a little more pressed but not uncomfortable. I wore it for 5 hours, but it's comfortable till 1-2 hours.Pros:1) Profesional look2) Long CableCons:1) Sound Quality not worth $ 252) You can hear the outer environment easily even when the headphone is properly worn and songs playing on it."
3,OK but .....,"These are fine headphones except for one thing. The ear pads have a ""cracking"" sound when they are moved. I think it's just the sound of the pads moving in the brackets. But still it's annoying."
4,Steady Sony as always,"Bought these for my computer to listen mostly to Spotify and Youtube stuff, saw them eleswhere for twice as much. Good solid performer for the price, but a better sound card would imorove your listening pleasure."
2,It is not sound insulated!,"I thought that this headphone will help me to listen music in a quiet area such as library. But it didn't! Its' foam ear pads do nothing except make the headphone comfort. In addition the sound spreads from back surface of the speakers. However, the person beside you will hear the sound clearly and you will hear ambient voices.Generally it is not as good as it looks."
3,Really big and a little cheap,The main problem with these headphones is that they're huge and don't block out other sounds at all. Otherwise they're great for the money.
3,Okay for the price,"Item works well for cheap headphones, but they have developed an annoying static feedback that comes and goes intermittently. Very comfortable and are good for listening to audiobooks at work though."
5,Nice,They work really well. I should have bought two of them. They are great for watching movies and not disturb others.
3,Terribly Uncomfortable,"I'll list the pros first: 1)The sound quality is pretty good for this price, 2)They hold up well under regular use, and 3)The cord is a good lenght. I've had these Sonys now for around 2 yrs and they are still working fine but they are not made for long durations of wearing. They get to a point of being painful because it has nothing covering the hard palstic bands that sit on your head. They actually dig in after a while, what a horrible design. I remedy this by wearing a baseball cap whenever I use them. The price of 22.00 is very reasonable but if you're into listening to hours of music or tv then these won't make you happy."
2,Poorly made,"I got roughly two years uses out of these headphones, and then the plastic band broke for no apparent reason. The sound quality was good before, they were comfortable, but ultimately you get what you paid for in quality of construction, which is not good. If you plan on using headphones a lot, spend a little more money and buy yourself a quality pair."
2,Decent sound for a quiet location,"I was looking specifically for over-head headphones to help dampen the noise in the environment I work. Unfortunately, this don't do much at all to dampen outside noise. They have decent sound, but it can only be appreciated in a quiet environment."
4,"Outstanding, except that they look ridiculous","These headphones are significantly bigger than I thought when looking at the pictures. They stick out a full 2 inches from your ears. The only way you could wear these headphones and not look absurd is if you were Andre the Giant. Their size also makes them difficult to fit inside my bag.That being said however, I love them. They're extremely comfortable, even though I wear glasses. The sound quality is fantastic, as far as I can tell. They're a big step up from my previous pair. Despite their size, they're also really light.Overall, these headphones are great. I just won't be wearing them in public."
5,Made for a great xmas gift...,"Got these for my brother for Christmas since he constantly has headphones on for watching movies and making his own videos...got these for him (a serious upgrade from what he was using), was very pleased when they came in the mail...I almost want to order a second pair for myself. The price is more than fair, these headphones look good and are comfortable."
3,BIG SOUND,"The sound is great, but they are much bigger than I prefer. When on your ears, they are quite comfortable, but if you drop them around your neck (for standby mode), they restrict movement like a neck brace. Also, I had hoped they would block outside noise when worn even without music playing but this is not the case. Music sounds great though."
4,Awesome quality for great $$$,"Very good sound and built quality considering the price ($35). Almost all my friends guessed the price to be above $100 after hearing the sound. The only issue is that the padding that covers the ears tends to heat up the ears after keeping it on for more than 30min. Need to take a break every 30min to let my ears get some ventilation! Other than that, really good buy."
