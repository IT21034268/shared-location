5,Great bookshelf speakers,These are great bookshelf speakers. The speakers are very well made. The removable grill is on the speaker with magnets and is very easy to remove. The audio reproduction is very clear and better then any bookshelf speaker I have owned. The speakers are very efficient and require little volume to get full sound. Each one comes with four rubber feet to put under the speaker. The Klipsch Reference series is not like the Klipsch Synergy series. The reference series are mid to high end home entertainment speakers that you have to get through an authorized dealer.
2,Practical Advice for Making Money Reading Books,"I give this 2 stars because, after reading 72 pages, I had found at least 7 typos. One would think that a so-called professional writer would at least grant a cursory look at his typos. That said, I must say that his advice is clear and to the point. Also, he offers several good references."
2,i think this is electric piano,i bought this for my son to help him learn one of the pieces. i was disappointed to discover that the recording was done on an electric piano. tends to sound very mechanical.
4,"Good Package, Bad Ghost","This product is a great way to get your hands on Underworld and Resident Evil on the cheap. The only thing is, you have to put up with Ghost Rider. It makes sense loosely based on the 'theme' of the pack, but the movie pales in comparison to the Excellence of the other two.That being said, I am glad I bought this! Go ahead and pick it up. Resident Evil is cringe-worthy on Blu-Ray and Kate Beckinsale is amazingly gorgeous in Underworld."
1,To think that I paid money for this bad game,"stick with the classics/well made games like Final Fight, Knights of the Round, Batman Returns, Death and Return of Superman, etc. avoid this crummy game at all costs. 1 star."
5,The Best of the Simpsons: Boxed Set 1,"Yes, if you are a died-in-the-wool Simpsons fan like I am, then you definitely need this product. Not only do I recommend it because it's hilarious, but it comes with lots of interested facts on the Simpsons inside of the box. But, just because I'm totally crazed about the Simpsons, I'd say something like that, but anyway, if you are a die-hard Simpsons fan, you must get this set now!"
3,Description is lacking,"My complaint isn't as much with the product here as it is with the description. I'm a beginning photographer and I never developed my own film before so it would have helped me to know that a lot of clips (maybe all but I'm not sure) come with little prongs to hold the top of the negative through the sprocket holes. That's wonderful but I shoot medium format and the sprockets are way farther apart than the prongs on the clips. Not sure that will be a huge problem but it is bothersome. Maybe the description should mention these are only for 35mm film. That said, I did notice that the ""weighted"" clips are really just the same as the regular ones and the weight popped right out of one of them. Also, I think they were overpriced and I'm pretty sure I won't bother to buy any more."
5,LaCross Wind Sensor,I have had and used my LaCross Pro Wireless Weather Station for well over 10 years.I love it and this is the first time I have had to replace my Wind Sensor. We have very bad winds here so I really missed it not working. I hope this replacement is as good as my original. So far so good but it is new. I to could not find a replacement through LaCross. I really count on Amazon for buying many items I need. I have never had a problem with anything I have had to return which was just once. It was very easy and fast.
4,very fun,"We have really enjoyed our ice shaver. The ice is crunchier than real shaved ice, but we found that if we freeze the ice ourselves (rather than buy bags of ice) the shavings are lighter and less cruncy. It also seemed to get better the longer we used it."
2,"overrated crunchy slushy ice shredder, falsely hyped","Read all reviews and believed them. What a mistake. I have eaten shave ice from Hawaii and Los Angeles, and this machine does not make japanese or hawaiian shave ice or shaved ice. Anyone know what powdery snow feels like and that is what this machine and many reviewers promised--but the machine is a big disappointment. More like crunchy ice which is supercold since the ice mound becomes more dense and watery almost immediately. Brain freeze. Even the title of the item is misleading since the box for the crunchy slush maker clearly states it is a snow shredder!!! Kinda sad that this machine doesn't make ice better than the manual one I already have. I used store bought smaller ice cubes but that made no difference--still crunchy and melted fast. DO NOT BUY THIS if you want real shave ice."
4,Great Fun for all ages,"I bought the Hawaiice Electric Snow Maker for my husband's 11 year old niece for Christmas 2003. It was a huge hit. On every family get together since then, she wants to make ice treats for us. It turned out to be a gift that remains interesting and fun. The machine is well built and the blade is protected so little hands are safe...it does need supervision...I wouldn't let a child clean it...just operate it and make the treats."
5,Very pleased,"Very fast and easy to use. I've lived in both Maui and New Orleans and am very picky about the consistency of my shaved ice. This machine made light and fluffy shaved ice out of regular ice cubes from my freezer. Great deal for the price. Kids loved it, too."
3,"Poor packaging, good light","The light is sent out with minimal packaging that results in major damage to the reflector. Overall, I think the light looks good, but a new method for protecting the light in transit is needed."
4,Sarah McLachlan knows something you don't know.,I was at Lilith Fair this summer and heard Sarah McLachlan (my heroine) was going to get up and sing with a new band (Talking to Animals). So I checked them out and had the best time. I bought the cd and it's just as great. And I think it's cool that artist's like Sarah M. support their piers.
1,Zalestra - my side effects,Took the reccomended dose yesterday and felt fine. Today took the two pills before breakfast and developed a migraine and rash on my abdomen. It was so bad I had to leave work. Very dissapointed with this product and the remaining pills went straight in the trash!! Buyer beware.
4,zalestra or red wine?,"Menopause could have made me an alcoholic. I was feeling old, fat and ugly...and need I mention that my grand-daughter just got married? That can drive anyone to drink. Fortunately I have alot of people that care about me. My sister's mother-in-law recommended Zalestra. Since taking itI feel much better about myself and I actually have the energy to go to the health club in my condominium complex and swim like I used to. Oh and I am more pleasant to be around."
4,This is heloping with my energy level and mood swings,"My symptoms were severe before taking Zalestra, now I'm back to my old self. I haven't lost any weight though, then again I've only gained 6 lbs."
1,Zalestra Disappointed,This product was all hype and no results. After several days on this drug I not only had no relief from symptoms but also had no change in appetite. I was very disappointed. Didn't expect a magic pill but expected a little something to happen.
1,Oprah has NEVER endorsed this product!!!,"Some of the reviews on this product are simply incorrect/fraudulent. Oprah has never endorsed this product. After doing a search on her website and finding no information about her using this product, I contacted the Oprah show, who stated in writing that Oprah has NEVER endorsed this product, nor does she Even know that it exists.Folks do not believe all these reviews, just see what the reviewers are also reviewing in addition to this product (those that claim Oprah used it) and you will see what I mean."
4,Works for Me,"I've been taking this product for 2 months and I can see a big difference in my weight, mood, sleep, etc. I'm nearly 40 and was having trouble losing weight. I can't take caffeine because it makes PMS worse. This product is fabulous and I feel great."
3,Zalestra,"Well, the jury is still out. Having tried EVERYTHING I was skeptical about the efficacy of Zalestra but since I have been taking it-almost two months-I haven't had a hot flash and am feeling pretty level. The only downside is that I haven't lost a pound (I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) despite proper diet and exercise. i am keeping my fingers crossed that the weight will start to come off but no hot flashes is a welcome relief."
3,"Great product, wish I found it sooner","I didn't start taking Zalestra till almost the end of my menopause. I did gain alot of weight however, I'm in the process of working it off with my early morning walks. I also started taking a yoga class which helps me feel relaxed yet energetic.I highly recommend yoga to not only women going through menopause but everyone: Man, Woman, and child!"
5,Theoretical as well as practical insight,"The first part of the book is essentially of a theoretical nature, with a thorough treatment of fractal geometry at a mathematical point of view. The second part on the other hand provides a flavour of the problems of fractal geometry in practice...so mathematicians as well as people interested in applications only should both find this book interesting. The maths are not easy but quite ""understandable"" for science undergrads...some notions of calculus or topology would help... but the introduction is excellent and allows anyone to follow the course of the book (but for understanding the proofs a good math background is required).Excellent for understanding the geometrical properties of fractals."
4,An outstanding account of the life of William Slim.,"Read in conjunction with William Slim's ""Defeat into Victory"", Lewin provides a superb appreciation of the forgotten WW2 battles in Burma and the life and times of Britain's outstanding Army commander of the 20th century. A splendid portrait of the soldier, general, proconsul and man. A must read for any serious student of 20th century warfare."
3,"Good, but impractical information","While covering a lot of infomration, this book still did not answer basic questions about how to use Sharepoint. It is geared more for the tech/programmer rather than the end-user."
2,"Nice graphics, gameplay is weak","This seemed very cool when i first installed it. This game concept is just like Dungeons and Dragons online. I thought it was going to rock as soon as i started choosing my character and class. The graphics look really good but just can't compare to DDO. The quests in this game just drag on moving from one loading screen to the next. Also the combat system is really slow, and depressing when you click and it takes 5 seconds to hit the monster. Its just like playing an old school game with new graphics. I just left the game in its box and uninstalled it, I can't even sell it on ebay now because its not even worth the shipping costs. I'm never going to buy a game brand new in a store as soon as it comes out. 50 bucks on this just put tears in my eyes...depressing!"
5,Neverwinter Nights 2,"A very intricate game with nice graphics and endless options.You character can be anything from a righteous, high-class warrior to an evil vagabond rogue of the slums.The dialogue you choose affects your relationships with your comrades and the weapon system is entirely able to be customized.I enjoy the story and the endless options which make it possible to play the game repeatedly and find new things.There is a multiplayer option, but I haven't tried it yet."
2,Very Disappointed,"As a fan of the first NWN, I was really looking forward to this.The game lacks in quality like I've never seen before."
1,just not into it.,Now im not gunna bash this game because i bought not knowing what it was. However it is good to play around on with ur friends. There are also better free games online but its cheap enough u wont miss the change.
2,"Bypass this, play NWN1 Diamond Edition","As a devoted player of Neverwinter Nights 1 and the expansions, mods, etc, I was very excited to play the new game, Neverwinter Nights 2.What a disappointment! The graphics are poor, there are many fewer character customization options, the performance of the game is hideous, and the companion AI is [...].The storyline is pretty good although sometimes it's not clear what is really happening and some quests/moments aren't woven into any part of the story at all.The story is linear, as was NWN1, but there seems to be much more railroading of the PC than in the first game.Overall I wouldn't recommend this game. Instead I recommend the Diamond Edition of NWN1, other downloads from Bioware and a browse through community made modules."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This game is resource and diskspace hog, and it is at times hard to see why. Graphics are better than NWN1, but not great. Game play is good, but the player interface is totally different from NWN1, and that appears to annoy a lot of people. Over all, a decent game, but not great. If you like the D&D; dungeon crawl (which lets be honest, that is what a D&D; game IS), it is a good game. The current patch was over 100 MBs, and solves many problems.For all those who are upset, remember what NWN1 was like when it was first released. This is a step above, and a good game. But just not quite great."
5,Harry Chapin: the authentic story teller,"I consider Harry Chapin one of the greatest songwriter and balladeer ever. I think that Harry Chapin and John Prine are two of the most overlooked treasures in music today and yesterday, and both are among the few I love to listen to over and over and over again. I buy every album he put out and all other CDs that are put out. I love his live albums and video and to ""studio cut"" for albums. Harry was taken from us far to soon. Do your children a favor and turn them on to Harry, and John. I got my heavy metal, rap, and hip-hop listening son to listen to Harry and John and he is a fan."
3,Bob Mackie set,The lotion was old and I could not use it. Colone was great as usually. This is my favoriet colone.
3,Who'd-A-Thunk It?,"Being from Michigan, I used to have a sort kin'ship with Target, and it's family of stores. Hudsons was the LAST of the real department stores, and although I'm not sure I ever shoped there, I still remember THE Hudson's store in Detroit. And who could for get the Hudson's Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade? So when I found this book in a discount bin I though... Why not? What I didn't realize is how wide ranging and insightful the company is. As your reading the book, you find you self saying over and over again.... ""WOW.. I never realized that that was what I like about Target"" For example, ever notice there's no music playing overhead? Me either, and till it was pointed out. If you have a background or even an interest in retail, marketing, or corprate structure this book is a must. If all that stuff bores you, and you just love to shop... well... then it's still a great book."
5,Good find,"Truthfully, not many manufacturers are making these baskets out of copper.I was happy to find this one.This is well-made, however, I would wish they had made the parts holding each basket to the chain heavier to take some overloads (make them able to hold more weight in fruit and vegetables than what it is rated).Otherwise, I am pretty satisfied with the product."
2,Don't do it!,"Don't waste your money. Like some of the other reviewers wrote, my basket broke with a few apples and oranges in it. I used a pliers to squeeze the chains back together but now I'm afraid to put anything in it. I gave it two stars because it's still hanging. I wouldn't buy it again though."
2,three tier basket fell,"purchased three tier basket not even month ago secured hook to roof and added three pound bag of small apples and three small bananas. during the day the basket fell apart at tier chains sending fruit all over kitchen. I initially thought it was a very nice looking product but after it fell apart at chains, I'm beginning to wonder if it is suppose to be functional or just for looks with plastic fruit?"
3,basket,What can you say about a hanging basket. I does what is is designed to do and you can use it a s a decoration with a bit of craft skills.
4,Priceless,"I am retired and live on a pond in southern NH. I spend my summers pond to pond, bass fishing. My aim is to fish them all. Clarks' guide is the single most important thing in my tackle box! I pick an area on the NH map and find a lake. I look it up in Clarks', and review it and all the water bodies on the way. It has an excellent section on rivers. It also covers aquatic plants, access and depth info, dissolved oxygen levels etc. on a plethora of maps and charts. It features an introduction which explains in detail the lake cycles and fish habits. I have a 2003 edition and it is quite complete, although I believe there is a later edition."
3,Microdermabrasion Kit,The system works pretty well but it appears that the hardware itself is a little under powdered. If you press a little harder to scrub the unit will stop.
3,"Good, but there are better choices available","Good machine, but I would recommend Nespresso E350 Romeo. It costs $150 more, but if you really love good espresso it worth it. You will get much more choices and better quality from Romeo and it is very easy to operate."
4,"Great concept, great espresso, so-so machine quality","I have two Nespresso machines and generally love the concept. Great coffee, quick and easy to make. Outstanding when it works. Two issues:First, I've had my D290 for 18 months and have had two break-downs (it gets regular use, but at home, not the office). The first breakdown(after 4 months) was related to the electronics, the second due to a leak. Customer service was excellent, though I had to negotiate a warranty extention on the second breakdown (one month out of warranty). I had heard rumors of machine quality problems before I bought, but found the concept too compelling.Secondly, I find the milk steamer performance only so-so. I usually only drink espresso, so it's not that big a deal for me, but people who are really into cappuccino will want to look into the steamer capability, especially if you are not using whole milk.Bottom line: great concept, great espresso but for the price I would have expected fewer mechanical problems."
3,"good coffee, but noisey","This unit makes good coffee, which I knew and that's why I bought it. But it's a noisey little bugger. The pump is loud and causes the whole unit to vibrate and make noise, which is mildly disturbing and irritating when I press the button in the morning. I guess it doesn't matter, but it would be a lot slicker if it were quiet and smooth. I previously had a bottom of the line model (not a Nespresso) and it's pump behaved similarly, so I think it's a matter of the pump, not anything being wrong. Still, I know the Swiss could engineer it quiet and smooth if they wanted to. Also, my brother compared the cost of the ""club only"" coffee with the coffee he buys for his Keurig (which, by the way, is quiet and smooth, but uses a lower pressure system) and the Nespresso coffee per cup costs a bit more but not much."
1,Millenium Collections Suck!!!!!!!!!,"To begin with, it's an insult to any decent artist to limit their 'best' to ten tracks--doubly so when you can generally fit at least 20 cuts on the average cd. Instead of using the opportunity to act as guardians of our cultural heritage, 20th Century Masters is doing their best to ensure that all but the most overplayed hits of any one band are lost to future generations. On general principles, avoid Millenium! Don't give these bastards your precious entertainment dollar! As for Sublime themselves, they only really released two cds. Why not purchase the originals? The debut, especially, is all killer, no filler."
2,"Good Music, Bad Album","Sublime's great, and these are great songs. But I have to agree with others. They are not all here. Either buy the two (three if you get the acoustic) albums they put out, or go buy ""Sublime: Greatest Hits."" For some screwy reason, that album is only available by import now, but that's the one you want, and it is available new from a number of reseller's here on Amazon. I'm buying it for the third time today as a gift for someone."
1,"Nah, skip this one","I bought this from Costco online for about two hundred shipped. I've had it for four months and while I was initially impressed, the temperature sensor has gone out. When I open the door to grab a bottle, the temperature reading will go crazy, and when I close it, it sometimes goes back to normal, sometimes gives me a flashing ""EL"", and sometimes it will give a low temperature, between 10 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Then I have to keep reopening and closing the door, or the unit will not stay cool. The warranty is a joke, too, lasting one year - except after two months you have to pay for shipping to send it back to Whynter. I've noticed that Costco has dropped this item from inventory. Gonna try my luck with a Vinotemp next.."
3,"A very good, but limited support","This is an excellent tool for mild toe movement control, but in my case, the big toe is prone to move almost completely beneath the second toe and it requires a strong brace to hold it in place. This brace does not do that. It does not do the trick for me on my one foot that has a real major problem with the big toe. My other foot has the same problem but much milder. So I am using this Wheaton Bunion Brace on that foot and am looking for something much stronger for the other foot."
2,Rubs on second toe painfully,"The seam on the inside of the big toe part digs into my second toe so hard that even when I wear it overnight, not walking at all, it creates a deep red-purple line that bites into my toe and remains visible and sore for nearly two days after. I don't have large feet (women's 7) so it's not that my feet are too big for the size.I'm still holding out hope that I can alter it a little with some sewing, because the overall concept is good. I just wish it corrected the lean of the big toe a little more firmly as well. Anytime I put weight on it the toe just goes back to the wrong position."
3,book,"I'm sure I'll enjoy this book.I liked the fast shipping, and I would do business with this seller again."
3,"Dead, all right...","While the story does move around the George Romero concept, and involves several key characters, each with the possibility of dieing, it lacks depth. You don't really feel for the characters, who seem to be going through the motions.Still, the storyline itself is interesting enough, with a unique perspective on the whole "" Living Dead "" concept, by throwing more than one or one group of main characters at the reader. It just doesn't grab you and eat your brains like some others in this genre."
1,A barf bag in every seat pocket,"There's a barf bag in every seat pocket, but not for scenes of graphic voilence or the heady sickness associated with fear. Mostly, it's a bag of disgust, such as that one feels for the indigent talk show guest or for the sad, rheumy eyed Wal-mart greeter who's soiled himself in the middle of second shift. It's the smell of the cheese used in Big Macs, only amplified until it screams and begs you to kill it.That's where this is at, and it's in no way related to any of the above. This book is vanilla ice cream, laced with cardboard, shot with a wide angle lense."
3,"Good start, poor ending","I enjoyed most of the book, but there is a subplot involving a priest which just did not cut it for me. The ending felt rushed, although I do want to find out what happened to this merry band of survivors."
3,Pretty Good,"I liked this book fairly well. It had several patterns in it that I enjoyed using. However, the only patterns in it that I could use to knit for the men in my family were in the charity knit section--one hat, one scarf. I was really disappointed on that point."
2,Absolute waste of time,"I think this book is very wordy and could have been cut short by atleast a hundred pages. I really don't understand how some of the reviewers have praised the hero of this novel so much.I think he is too perfect, too experienced(in matters of sex,of course.Seems to me he spent a major portion of his thirty nine years perfecting the art of sex), too rich, too controlled, too everything to be normal according to me. There should be atleast some shortcomings in a hero's character to make him more interesting.This guy has been there, done everything. And the references to his past sexual escapades are really not necessary.If the author was trying to project Etienne as some sex god, she really overdid it!There were too many secondary characters from her previous novels and too many scenes which were completely irrelevant and which bogged down the pace of the book.I should have paid more attention to the title of the novel before purchasing it."
3,Adequate medical mystery-conspiracy thriller,"Teri Knight is spending her evening home alone watching television when she answers a knock on the door.Standing before her is a young woman and Teri's 11 year old son Gabriel.Gabriel disappeared some 10 years earlier ,aged 11 and now he is brought back into her life looking exactly as he did at the time of the disappearance.Later that night Teri and Gabriel are forced to flee when heavily armed men arrive at her door and try to abduct the pair.They seek the help of Walter Travis ,an ex cop now a private eye specialising in tracing missing children.They investigate and discover a government covert research plan to prevent ageing lies at the root of the mystery.Good characterisation and well described action scenes keep the momentum up and the book , while covering no new ground,is diverting and will appeal to readers whose taste runs to the likes of Robin Cook.Good solid reading ."
1,Faulty Pump Head Fitting,I have purchased and returned 2 Bell Airstrike 1900 pumps before I found one with a pump head that would fit my tire valves. These are very cheaply made pumps and Bell does not have a quality control department that can ensure that their pumps will perform the basic function of fitting smoothly but tightly over valves. This flaw can be costly to consumers; I have torn 2 tire valves while trying to force the Bell pump heads to fit correctly.
5,Fishboy,"Whoa! Like a cross between William Burroughs' ""The Western Lands"" and Amos Tutuola's ""My Life In The Bush of Ghosts."" Surely Mark Richard's ""Fishboy"" is on that level of mastery.It took me about two months of casual reading to get through this short (227 pages) book but it was worth it. Getting lost in this book is part of the journey, as you'll soon discover. Eloquent chaos and heart wrenching beauty. But not for linear readers!"
5,perfect buy,bought this for my friend's 3yr old daughter and she loves it wont give it a break my friend told me she has the house under control
3,Misleading Product,I was disappointed that it was Joe and not Steve. They have bonus features showing the episodes with Steve but overall it will be Joe. I have a 16 year old and we all grew up with Steve and I purchased this dvd combo in hopes of passing along the Blue's Clues tradition to my 2 year old. I am under the impression there was some deliberate false advertising because when I ordered it the first name they had starring was Steve Burns followed by everyone else.Overall the teaching fundamentals are great but to be honest Joe just doesn't cut it.
5,Wonderful,"My daughter is crazy for Blues Clues. We bought this set of videos a while ago and still watch them at least twice a week! I wish Blues Clues were still around, but these videos help with that."
3,This is Nothing More Than a Discounted Repackaging,"Those who were hoping that perhaps the release of ""Blue's Clues"" box-sets might bring new special features, such as commentary or behind-the-scenes documentaries, are going to be disappointed. If you've been keeping up on your ""Blue's Clues"" DVD releases, then there is nothing here you haven't already seen. ABC's 123's and More Collection is nothing more than a repackaging of three previous DVDs: Blue Takes You to School, Shapes and Colors, and Blue's Big Band. If you don't have those, or haven't seen them before, this box-set might be worth checking out, since you get a lower price than you would purchasing all three separately. Otherwise, I recommend passing on this box-set."
2,boring,"my 15 month old son loves the blues cues doll he received as a present, but the video doesn't hold his attention. it's slowpaced and was advertised as teaching abc's, but never seems to get to the point fast enough so that he's not pouring through his books or something else on the other side of the room.my son doesn't watch a lot of TV, but sesame street holds his attention and this just doesn't."
2,Sorry to Disagree,"It appears thus far that I'm the only one who doesn't believe this book is some profound work. After reading the reviews on the back cover, I wondered if I even read the same book. I must state that the premise of this book had extreme potential. The storyline was great with a HUGE event that happens to the main character, Frank Gale (not wanting to give anything away). However, the pages and pages and pages and pages of describing ""WHAT IF this event DIDNT happen how would things be"" made reading it unbearable. Every other scenario was disected and I just had to skip over this overkill of filler and get to the real story. I understand that some may say that the point of the book is to understand Frank's every thought but is it really necessary? Tolkin should've just stuck to the story."
5,Good,"great product, I need 17 more words to submit this review, so Here goes. It is worth the price. Won't hesitate to get more"
2,Australian EP by Matthew Tow from 1994.,1) Help me to understand(Finding my way) 2) Sunday night 3) Olympic white 4) Silver city 5) Shine on(backward reprise) Written & performed by Matthew J. Tow. Released in 1994 by Shock Records.
1,decieving,"I did not know I had to buy a special Cd player for this 16 dollar cd. They range from 300-500 dollers.My bad. I guess I had to read the FINE PRINT.bad description, especially when this cd format is not widely known."
4,Beautiful Punjabi Movie,Truly a Punjabi film entrenched in sorrow and the overwhelming feeling of happiness in due time. Beautiful roles played by Jimmy Shergill and the main actress.
4,As an adoptive parent I found the stories to ring true.,As an adoptive parent I found the stories in Parents at Last to ring true. It was so encouraging to see many different kinds of families gathered together in one book. There are many ways to go about creating a family. The only constant is love and commitment. Several of the stories reflect the parents feeling that their child was meant to be theirs. We also experienced that faith as we searched for our daughter 5 years ago. This is a beautiful book that I plan to share with our adoption support group.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity."
2,"I agree, Where is Sheryl Crow's Safe and Sound?","If they use a song by an artist, especially to open or close the movie, then a deal exists somewhere, that the artist was paid for their song to be used and should be included on the soundtrack. I was very disappointed when I couldn't find ""Safe and Sound"" by Sheryl Crow. I didn't buy the soundtrack. If you can't put the most memorable songs on the soundtrack, which evoke the feeling of the movie all over again when you listen to it, what's the point?"
4,Forget the dope/shortbus/Sesame St refs,"Seems like every review of this record feels obligated to mention the fact that it sounds like some bored suburban stoners sampling Sesame Street records and placing them to a backdrop of downtempo 808 beats. OK, so that's not entirely untrue, but look past all that for a second. Mall manage to create some tantalizing and amusing songs by picking a ridiculously simple melody line and stacking well-placed samples, loops, and digi-ambience atop it all. It's a mess, but a very entertaining and soothing mess that really clicks in more places than fails. It may not be anything you can't do yourself at home with those thrift-store keyboards hiding in the closet, but Mall have done it, and maybe that was the point to begin with. Go blow the dust off that cheesy Casio and start blipping away. Make your own noise."
5,Great Watch,"This watch is very nice looking. I didn't need it, but if your wrist is larger than medium sized, they do include an extra band in the box.FYI for those who might want to change the band: I tried to change out the bands by myself but I think you need special tools or get a professional to do it."
3,Still Would Buy It,"I expected this curler to curl like a regular hair hot curler (fast), but it doesn't. It does work though - with practice. It almost seems like the curling effect is cumulative. In any case, I do like it as it does curl once you get the hang of it."
5,A delightful book about experiencing Christmas through a child's eyes,"Featuring a main character, ""Mr. Finnegan"", based on legendary celebrity Dick Van Dyke, Mr. Finnegan's Giving Chest is a Christmas-themed picturebook about Maggie, a young girl who enjoys bullying others, even during the Christmas season. She unexpectedly meets the mysterious Mr. Finnegan, a toymaker who looks after the Giving Chest. The Giving Chest disburses gifts; its purpose is not to reward oneself, but rather to help others. Mr. Finnegan sends Maggie on an seemingly simple errand with the chest, and in the process, she learns more about holiday cheer and begins to feel the warmth of Christmas spirit. A delightful book about experiencing Christmas through a child's eyes, striking illustrated with smoothly rendered, three-dimensional digital art. Mr. Finegan's Giving Chest has a fair amount of text for a picturebook; an accompanying audio CD offers a read-aloud performance by Dick Van Dyke himself."
3,"Nothing great, nothing bad about it","My daughter (aged 4) and I read this book together. It is a bit mature for her and therefore did not hold her attention as well as books usually do. The book explores the topics of friendship, how to handle difficult feelings, how to adjust to change, and how to say goodbye/deal with a loss (divorce is also mentioned a little). These topics are handled well, which is why I gave the book 3 stars. The reason that I did not give it four or five stars is that the book was not particularly witty or engaging, not did Amber and Justin really 'sound' like third-graders (at least not in the same way that Junie B. Jones sounds like a kindergartner). I would recommend this book if your elementary-aged child is confronting the issues that Amber faces in this book. Otherwise, I would probably not recommend it."
3,"Sweet Story, Predictable","This is a sweet story about third-grader Amber Brown, whose best friend Justin Daniels is moving to Alabama with his family. Because the two kids can't express their feelings about losing each other, they quarrel and then don't talk to each other. At the end, they make up. A quick read with sympathetic characters, but nothing unexpected or surprising in the plot."
4,Vandal Hearts,"Vandal Hearts is a good game. Graphics is ok for it's time, though the character images are really sad. It's hard to take seriously a bunch of characters that look like rats or constipated monkeys. I recommend this game for the story-line, which is actually pretty decent. But it's a really easy game and can be beat relatively quickly."
3,MONO sound,I bought this album on CD in order to get a non-compressed (lossy compression/data reduction such as mp3) version of a great tune; Without You by Peabo and Regina Belle. When getting the album home and hearing it was in mono I was propelled into a dimension of ultra-pissed off.What the hell happened? I downloaded the mp3 version from this album on Amazon and it was as stereo as the day is long.What's even more amazing is that no one else apparently even has noticed it. Certainly there are others that have gotten mono copies too; Rhino/Elektra/Whatever didn't just produce one copy of this in mono.This needs to be corrected. We live in the damned 21st century and these recordings were done in the 80's and 90's in STEREO. Fix your QC Rhino/Elektra/Whatever and recall these; no excuse.Addenda: I saw another review here also noting the mono sound.But where do I get another copy of that song on a non-compressed format?
1,BORING,"My entire family was bored to the point of parody by the end of this movie. How many times can you show the same wall art in one movie?? This one breaks a world record I'm sure. At best this should have been 20 minutes long to setup the find, deliver the images and then give final impressions. Instead it drags on and on and on. The 3d on our set was double image as well. We all (family of 5 diverse people) give it 1 star."
2,CAVE of forgotten english,"I Bought this 3-D movie, becuase I love 3-D. However this Documentary is Terrible. the color is faded. the Explorers all all French with very heavy Accents I found it very difficult to pay attention. the 3-D is passible. But I will warn you all. It is not the 3-D that we are used to seeing at the movies. I could have Done a Much better Job with my 3-D Equipment."
2,Cave of Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzs,"Holy Snoozefest. If you want to see some real dreams really fast... watch this. ""Zees cave haz bean heeya fo zounzands of yearz, vee mast beez carefulz eenzide zee cave..."" Ugh."
4,Archeology + Cinematography,"This film has what it takes to engage both sides of the brain, five stars worth. The narrator (sonorous) and the soundtrack (screechy), however, became monotonous over the course of the film. Recommended overall -- certainly would be even better in the original 3D!"
3,Just ok!,It's ok! The pictures in th cave does not look like real.(I really need to type more than 18 words?)
3,His verbal understatement begins to claw after a while,"First of all, the cultural and artistic significance of this discovery is astounding, and the visuals are great.Yet, the stereoscopic advantage of viewing these graphics is of questionable value, and after a while his nearly monotone narration began to irritate me.I guess I would buy it again for the price. It is somewhat of a relief to have stereoscopic video about a subject of cultural interest as apposed to pure visual eye-candy."
2,review of cave of forgotten dreams,"I was very excited to order this video , unfortunately, it was long on anticipation but short on content. very little narrative , alotof video of the same images set to music. The authors/producers could have done so mmuch more with this ancient cave art. It is a shame."
4,A great sequel to the CONTRA Series,"Another game in the popular Contra series, this one goesto show why the series in so popular. It managed to capture the market because of it's simplicity in it's jump and shoot gameplay and the intuitive game bosses. The Alien wars continues in the tradition with simple gameplay and a lot of baddies hogging the screen. The sounds are good and the gameplay is easy at first and gets progressively harder every stage. This is a good game for all the action freaks and will certainly fulfill your action quotient for a few hours at least. There are about 6 levels and the bosses go in the typical contra style with huge obnoxious heads and potruding multiple limbs. The storyline is not that great and seems to be just an afterthought to the action. Buy this one and you will not be disappointed.OVERALLGRAPHICS-4/5SOUND-3/5GAMEPLAY-5/5"
5,Whip a pitbull's A$$,"Wesley Willis is by far one of the most influential musicians in the United States. His work is pure genius, from the haunting refrain of ""Vampire Bat"" to the story of Wesley's own run-ins with urban violence in ""He's Doing Time In Jail."" Wesley opens up and tells his fans what drives him in ""Chronic Schizophrenia,"" and he shows his softer side in the powerful ballad dedicated to his cab driver friend in ""Who Killed John Columbo?"" Wesley's girth is almost as vast as his musical prowess. Log on now and pick up this harmony joy-ride. SCREAM DRACULA, SCREAM!"
1,Sony Laptop Flaws,"Let me start by saying that I do not own this laptop, but have 2 other Sony laptops, a GRX580 and an FXA-10, and both laptops are about 14 months old. Both have 512M memory installed, and both have the same problem with one or both of the SODIMM slots. They only read 256MB of memory. I've inspected the SODIMMM connections to the mainboard and the solder joints are BROKEN!!!There is a potential class-action lawsuit that will soon be started. DO NOT BUY SONY!!! They are ignoring our problem. This is widespread. Go to http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/ and read about our woes.DO NOT BUY SONY!!!Regards,Ron S."
2,"Good for a disposable printer, it just doesn't last long","After owning a seperate scanner and printer for awhile, I bought this combined unit to save some desk space. The price seemed right, and I didn't need the extra fancy features of the more expensive units, such as the LCD screen etc.To me, HP should have removed the memory card slots and put more engineering into the paper feed tray. My unit has worked flawlessly for about a year (or maybe less). I was very excited about the copy feature and scanner as it worked so well.But now as I sit, the paper tray will not feed paper. One sheet, multiple sheets, the tray will not grab the paper. I suspect to fix this unit, it will cost more than what I paid for it originally. The scanner still works wonderfully.If you search online, there are some other people that have experienced this same thing. I haven't even burned thru the original ink cartridges yet. Very disappointing."
5,Don't Be Put Off By The Bare-Bones Production,"The first time I watched this film, it was not with an open mind. To me the cheap production and utilization of hokey cartoon characters made the film a joke. I didn't even watch the whole thing. But a few points the film made stuck with me, and later I watched it again with an open mind, paying close attention to the arguments that were being made. Turns out the film is well presented, argued, and documented. I am thankful to the filmmaker for opening my eyes. Very interesting revelations about George Herbert Walker Bush and others."
5,Howie Nave = F U N N Y !,"If you love music AND you love to laugh, you're going to SO enjoy this compilation of funny and zany songs by Howie Nave. There's so much joy coming thru on each of his songs and he hits a 10 out of 10 on the originality scale. A must buy!"
4,Lyrics More Revealing Than You'd Think,"A collection of funny tunes about life, love & sexual confusion with a few heartfelt songs thrown in. Hard to believe a guy that funny and talented has to rent dates!!! Keywords Howie Nave Dating!2007 update - Still a funny album, but the artist really needs to come with a warning label. There IS a reason this guy shouldn't be dating. Only thing missing from that CD is a song about Ben!"
3,Book is a good read very light reading,"Good book for a beginner, with little dog experience. I bought it for reference as I had seen her video and thought it was fantastic. I would buy the video over the book. The book is still informative."
5,Brilliant,"Michael Gira's first solo outing without Jarboe is some of his best work to date. This album will completely absorb you into its miserable complex. From the opening clatter of ""See Through Me"" to the reflective vocal of ""Blind,"" Drainland twists and turns and takes you through every recess of uncomfortable emotion. Fans of Swans' later work will not be disappointed. One of the most important albums of the decade!"
1,I never got it,I bought a lot of things at the same time I bought this and just realized I never received it... Not happy.
3,Some what disappointed ):,I heard the book was awesome and couldn't wait to hear the CD. I think it's just because I wasn't familiar with the artists but I did like the lyrics.
3,It's got Bruce!,"Oh how wonderfully horrible. There's more cheese in this game than there is in a triple-decker Mcgrease burger but it's oh-so-good. And no narration in recent memory can top what the Bruce offers here. Game-play is surprisingly deep, the story complex and convoluted enough to stay interesting to the very end. I have to admit though, it's tough to slog through to the end."
1,Poor Quality Item,"The books I got was in such poor quality I could not gift it. The book had extensive water damage, and the binding was broke. Not a great seller."
3,A Necessary Burden,"So many needless rules and so much that is left out or too vague. The set up is poor. Rather than organized bullet points for quick reference you have to pour through paragraph after paragraph searching for the information you need. Likewise, the back of the book where all the charts are supposed to be collected for simplicity only contains a handful. If you are playing a second edition campaign like I am (probably because you were outvoted for version 3 or 4 like I was) then you still need one to help you as best it can. I definitely would not pay top dollar for it though. In the end, probably best to ignore most of the rules, use common sense, and see the book as nothing more than a guideline at best."
2,"A sad, broken classic...","We may have all started gaming with Ad&D, but the game has failed to change with the times. Its rules tend to straitjacket players into certain types of behavior or choices (classes and alignment) rather than encouraging variation. Just one choice (class) determines almost 90% of your powers, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses! And the focus of the game is still on the dungeon-crawl monster-whackfest that might have been satisfying when I was in my teens, but leaves me cold now that I'm a bit older and demand more complexity from my storylines. There's precious little in either book about techniques for telling stories, world-building, characterization, etc.And the book itself...yuk! The artwork is HORRIBLE! The previous edition was really pretty."
3,Only 1 song on the disc...,"I really love John Conlee and was looking for a DVD of his songs. Unfortunately, only 1 song is on this entire DVD. The entire disc is probably less than 10 minutes long. On the bright side, it seems a portion of the proceeds go to a good cause. We need a label to publish a real DVD featuring Mr Conlee. Too bad this technology didnt exist in the early to mid 80's or else we'd probably already have something."
3,But what happened to him!?!,"This book was really great at filling in the gaps in my knowledge of Lenny Breau, but I was hoping to find out more about his death under mysterious circumstances. I had heard that his wife at the time was a suspect, but unfortunately the author couldn't get an interview with her, so the reader is left with nothing new on that front. I would have liked to hear her side of the story. I also was hoping for some fresh quotes from Chet Atkins. Chet and Lenny's relationship was a special one, and to not have any new stuff from Chet's perspective is a bummer. I guess Chet died before the author could get ahold of him. Other than that, I found the book a very enjoyable read. Makes me want to sith right down and practice!"
2,Orthodox Translations of the New Testament,"Our local Orthodox church here uses the Gospel lectionary that Holy Apostles Convent publishes. While the book itself is very attractively done and laid-out, its rendering is awkward to bad English, often hard to understand, and above all more interpretation than translation. If their ""Orthodox New Testament"" is like this, I would not be impressed."
4,GOOD DOG FLEECE TOY,AVERAGE TO ABOVE AVERAGE FLEECE DOG TOY WITH SQUEAKER. A BIT LARGER THAN EXPECTED (a good thing) and decent quality.
2,Flippers,"I could kick myself. I read all the reviews on Amazon before buying them, but sure enough the reviews are right that these flippers run very small. There is nothing wrong with the flippers....they just don't fit. Buy bigger than what you think you need."
1,As misguided and erroneous as the rest.,"This author is infamous for writing atrocious books on C++ (check [..] for reviews written by people who are familiar with the subject), but I haven't actually seen a review of this book -- it's the textbooks that do most damage and get most attention -- so I took a quick look at it myself.I opened a random page and read a totally false statement about something as trivial as the return of main(). I opened another random page and read a misleading statement about overlapping regions for copy(). Opened another random page, and read a false statement about placement new, mercifully brief since he didn't explain anything about it -- that's another weak point of the book, it only names most parts of the language and the library, barely saying anything about their purpose or function, with the exception of the C language and C concepts, which are discussed (relatively) at length."
1,"It's bad, derivative, typical rock",let's just say that I am glad I got this disc used and that it won't remain in my collection past my next visit to the record store. The album seems to contain nothing but a mix of derivative cuts that regurgitate recent rock trends with a slight hint of hip-hop influence.
4,Works Well,"The meter works well and is fairly accurate. Good battery meter for the money, it should be more waterproof though. Easy to read and easy to carry. Recommended."
3,This is a good start,"When this album was recorded, Deist Requiem had a different bassist, guitarist and drummer. They had the right attitude though. Listen to Fucked Up Way to Die, Harder, and Wanna Be God. There will be better music from this band. Check out ""Hate Songs From the Heart"""
3,Works but too expensive,Works just as it said it would but costs way too much for such a simple little piece. JMHO
5,!Give me more!,"I don't like rap-beats, i don't like 4/4 housebeats, i don't like dumb sampling (-Fugees have set a trend).., i don't like stupid loops! * * AND THEN THERE WAS JAZZANOVA! * * Combining technique with musical feeling. It's above the other loungy stuff, it's jazzy (worth that name more than other dance-music); it's not sleepy like most 'jazzdance' stuff. A fantastic album! Up to 1100 samples per song?! Love them or hate them. * * Hopefully their career will continue with music as good as this!!"
5,A Must Read,"Looking Like the Enemy is a not-to-be forgotten book. I savored every word and image as I tried to imagine how I would feel in Mary's Matsuda's shoes as a teenager imprisoned by her own government simply because of her parent's ancestry.Mary's writing is so vivid and she makes the internment come alive as she shares her thoughts and feelings at being plunged into this terrible situation. While her anger and fear are so real, so also is the hope that her mother in particular, instills in the family.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand our history and also racial discrimination. In our world today when many are punishing those who ""look like the enemy"", may this book serve as a lesson to us all."
3,"Not bad, but he's composed better...","Though I am not going to throw the CD in my closet, I expected more based on some reviews I'd read. There are three or four nice tracks, but the others are mediocre at best; track three is possibly the most annoying tune he's ever written."
2,Dangerous item!,"This is a very pretty item, HOWEVER, I ordered this for my mom. She had it for less than 2 months and one day the plastic base caught on fire! Luckily she smelled the plastic burning and was able to get it before it burned the house down! The item was not even turned on. It was simply plugged in. I have written to the manufacturer to let them know of this problem. It is very pretty, but I do not recommend this item."
1,Don't bother,I ordered these timers for our middle school track meet. They brand is a good brand and one that we have used in the past. Unfortunately when we received the 6 that we ordered only one of them worked efficiently. The others either did not stop or the button on top stuck.Do not waste your time on these.....
1,(not) Good enough,"I had an Accusplit stopwatch that was simple and worked really well, so when I lost it I wanted to replace it with another Accusplit. One thing I don't like about most stopwatches that you find at sporting stores is that they make a beep sound when you press the buttons (and my first Accusplit was silent). As it turns out, this one beeps as well. And it does not seem to be made as sturdy as my first Accusplit. But it has worked well so far, so I can't argue with the price.Update: after a couple months, the buttons have stopped working. They ""stick"" and cause ""double tapping"" like others have mentioned."
5,ACCUSPLIT Survivor Stopwatch with Clock and Extra-Large Display,it really works well and we just love it it also very easy to use especially the stop watch my wife uses it whwn she exercises so she knows how long she has been at it
3,OK product,"I purchased this item several months ago and find it to be an acceptable stop watch. However, the instructions are overly complicated and hard to follow (I should have know better than to try to read instructions!). A good product for the money."
4,stop watch,The stop watch can be a bit confusing.Sometimes it sticks inone mode or another and youre stuck inthat mode till the device decudesd to move to the next mode.Other than that it works great
4,Excellent performances of hard-to-find new music.,"Having seen the MCE a number or times I bought this disk at the first opportunity and was not dissapointed at all. ""Four For Tango"" and ""Chaconne"" are definite standouts as well as ""watch...wait"" and ""rituale"". Both Siskind and Trenka are names to look out for in the future. Those familiar to the genere of string quartet should note that the performance of ""Four for Tango"" exceeds the recording by the Kronos Quartet in my book (and I am a devout Kronos fan)."
1,More Promotion of the Big Bang theory.,"The big bang myth leaves many holes and just goes arrogantly on its way ignoring them. Perhaps the author has chosen a nom de plume that is the antithesis of his philosophy. He bases his ""history"" on suppositional myth."
4,Interesting view of world history,"Dr. Christian's view is that history should begin with the creation of the Universe and look at over-arching themes. While this is an interesting concept, Dr. Christian fails to provide enough background information to the non-historian to see how the details support the bigger picture. It is a good methodology book for historians looking to see larger concepts, but it assumes a level of historical knowledge lacking in many laymen."
3,"Nice warmer, lame massager - not for pet owners...","This is an OK product - if you need to warm your feet up, go for it. However, the product is black and collects pet hair as quickly as your favorite pair of black pants. Massager is lame - but heating works pretty well...if you use one feature or the other you get much better results than trying to use both at the same time. Would be nice if they made this as booties, so you could actually move your legs and not have to sit in one position while using."
5,Short and Sweet,"This little gem has genuinely helped me to unlock the writer inside me! It is full of practical advice but most of all it is from the heart. If you are experiencing writer's block or are looking to expand yourself or even have some unresolved issues with yourself, I highly recommend this book!"
5,Lowepro DryZone Rover Backpack,"I gave this as a gift and was a little worried after reading some of the reviews. The recipient was very very excited! We tested out the water bladder and it holds water very well, he had a back up plan in case...there are other companies out there that make smaller water bladders, it's not a big deal to replace it. The zipper on the waterproof camera case on the bottom is crazy hard to open and close, but they kindly include zipper grease with the backpack, so we put it on and the more you open and close the zipper, the easier it gets. I really think he will get a ton of use out of the backpack seeing as we hike a lot...and are in a hot climate (yay for the water bladder!) and we are also planning on hiking around lots of water as well (yay for waterproof covering) The price at Amazon is also outstanding if you visit Lowepro's website and inspect what's going on over there..."
3,Some Problems with Waterproof Zipper System,"The overall quality of both Lowepro packs that I have is good to excellent. This bag has been out with me in rain and snow and other typically wet Southeast Alaska weather. My only issue with this bag has been that the waterproof zipper on the lower case is a little sensitive and if you are not paying close attention and making sure the two halves of the zipper are lined up, it will separate. This is happening more as the bag gets into its second year of use. If you decide to get one, just make sure that you are watching the length of the rubberized zipper and that it is fitted together well before you actually try and zip it up."
3,"Look great, quality just ok","The chairs look fantastic. But the construction is a bit rough around the edges and putting it together was a nightmare. The directions are not clear and I had to reassemble the first chair 3 times before I got it right. The first chair took over 2 hours to assemble, but once I was clear on how to piece it together, the second chair only took 30 minutes. They are not very sturdy, but for the price I should have expected it. Next time I'll probably spend a more to get a more solid chair. Overall, though, I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Can be difficult for toddler,I bought these for my 3 year old. He loves the spoon. But he doesn't like the fork because he can never get food to stay on it. The tines aren't very sharp so it can be difficult for him to stab his food with it. But I love the bamboo and recommend the spoons for sure!
5,For Grown-ups too,"I am ordering these as an alternative to plastics. For chemo patients, metallic aftertaste is a problem but plastics are toxic... so I searched for something else and found these. I am very happy."
5,Definately not for Beginners!,"This DVD is great if you have already mastered ""Heartbeat of Bellydance"" and ""Jillina's Level III"" Instructional cd's to name a couple. Not to mention having had some instruction from a teacher of Belly Dance! I was skeptical too because of the price, but it is worth the money! Of course nothing replaces having an instructor, but you do get alot out of the DVD. The chapters are user friendly for review- which some DVD's out there are not! And the moves are broken down easily enough for an intermediate/ advanced dancer. The moves are challenging and useful. They are not bland like some combination series are. I too swallowed my tongue when I saw the performance of the choreography to be taught and couldn't wait to learn it. My only complaint is that I wish IAMED would release a cd of the music used in their choreographies on their DVD's!"
5,Discus,I purchased a discus 40 and really use it a lot. Wanted more and purchased a number of sport discus's. Use them all the time for both music and dvd transportation. I highly recommend this product for keeping discs protected. I love this product.
5,Excellent vendor,The item came promptly in excellent condition. I would highly recommend this vendor
5,Great pens,"Very good if you need to write on paper.Also, I love how these pens write and feel. They last me a long time too."
1,NOT WHAT'S ADVERTISED,"These folks make it hard to return (answering machine full and didn't pick up) and charge a 10% restocking fee. The tail light is not as pictured (mine is all red).May be a good product, but not quite right for my bike."
5,Fits,"It's small enough to go anywhere, yet big enough to handle everything I need. Best of all no tired shoulders. One tough little bag."
4,ARCHITECTURE THROUGH THE AGES,"Found in the Legacies series, ""Architecture"" is a compact introduction to the various examples of architecture that we see every day.Beginning with the ancient world, illustrations, photographs, maps and charts guide the reader through the world's architectural styles and building methods.Lots of colorful facts and pertinent information in this one!"
5,"Author is Unix-focused, this is THE best dummies book.","Congratulations, Ken Coar! We're ready for the next edition. If every Dummies-series book were written like this, we wouldn't need O'Reilly titles...Seriously, this book is a really first-rate introduction that will get most of us who operate in the Unix/Linux space where we need to be. It's not Windows oriented at all which is just fine since Apache belongs to Unix, right? Friendly advice: Use the Apache Server Bible by Kabir if you must deploy on Windows. But better yet, dump NT and go with a stable OS for a stable, scalable web server."
4,Solid tent for the price,We really like this tent for car camping events. Not at all a backpackers tent -- quite heavy. but we really like how much tent we got for a resonable price. Kevin and Alexis
2,"Way too difficult, problems if you are not already 'in shape""","I thought there was more individualization - NOPE ... if you can't do a medium grade cadio workout, this isn't your program. I can't do impact exercise - the initial ""see how your fitness level is"" STARTED with ... JUMPING JACKS ... I did about 10 ... then there was no way to personailize it to say ""I couldn't DO this"" ... other issues of the same type - I'll be selling mine - I have not found anything for the x box and also using konect to say ""placement is correct"" - oh well. I hope this is useful to you... i'm 57 years old btw."
4,Very good exercise routines,"This is a good exercise ""game"". It is adaptable to your needs and is a different exercise every time. I take a Power Class two day a week and this is an equivalent exercise and really gets your heart rate up."
2,It's Ok.....,"Well I just saw everyone posting that this is the best ska album ever and giving it 5 stars..... Well it is not the best ska cd ever and really not worthy of 5 stars. The lyrics get kind of old after awhile.... kind of like listening to a jerky boys cd over and over again. There are some good songs on the cd, but if they are going to be a serious band why must they have those silly narrations in songs like midget pirates?... Listen to it like 4 times and it is dumb..... Thats all"
2,"Good, but not floored","I use tents in the desert at Fort Irwin, and use a Bradley tarp underneath. Even with the tarp, after about 10 nights total spent in the tent, the floor already has holes in it. The floor material is just too thin. I cannot even see how the material of the floor would ever hold up to wet weather if you didn't use a tarp underneath. I should say I am conscientious about putting my boots in the vestibule, but still - that floor material is just way too thin."
4,Informative and interesting,"I found this book to be informative and quite interesting. I certainly was not fully aware of the rich, ancient cultural history of Wisconsin. It is a tragedy that the arrogance of the 'later' settlers of this northern territory would eradicate such historically significant sites . . . but then they did the same all across North America."
2,how to make a complex subject obtuse,"The study of cognitive illusions within the discipline of social psychology is fascinating but not always easily accessible to the layperson. There is already a wealth of jargon that has to be explained in order to help the reader better understand this phenomena, and this author, by introducing the metaphor of ""tunnels"" and the like, manages to create confusion rather than clear it up. I suggest, without qualification, that the reader purchase Thomas Gilovich's book instead ""How We Know What Isn't So."" It was published about the same time and is a MUCH better guide. Also Scott Plous offers a straightforward, albeit less stylistically appealing and anecdotal presentation of many of the same illusions in his book ""The Psychology of Judgment and Decision-Making."""
1,Defective,"This book contains a decent explanation of the Monty Hall problem. That's the one OK part. The rest is just a pointless meandering through well-known illusions. The fundamental problem with the book becomes obvious near the end, where the author dismisses biological evolution out of hand! Light dawns: of course the book lacks critical analysis and depth, as the author's thinking is enormously defective. Without powerful, modern tools like evolutionary psychology these illusions are mere curiosities, and inexplicable. In this age we can do better, much better. For an in-depth look at puzzles and oddities of perception and consciousness by an author without such a glaring cognitive handicap, try a book by Douglas Hofstadter, V.S. Ramachandran, or Antonio Damasio."
4,A Tough But Rewarding Read,"This was a tough read for me because this book covers a lot of concepts related to probability with which I've always had trouble. Nevertheless it's a humbling eye-opener to know that we sometimes make decisions based on faulty reasoning but are not even aware of it. And it's not a matter of education or intelligence but appears to be the way our minds work. With awareness and experience we can identify and emerge from these ""mental tunnels"" and make better decisions and especially avoid potential disasters. For me, this book will require one or two more reads before it is fully grasped. My only real criticism, and therefore why I do not give it 5 stars, is that the author addressed critiques of his point against one particular individual in a tone that borders on mean-spirited. It's a rather jarring detour in an otherwise challenging book."
2,Amazon vendor delivered product timely,Amazon vendor delivered product timely. Preferred a more automated pet feeder in a different category.
4,Exceptional value,"I do trail riding at night in pitch black darkness. The trees are so dense that they block out moonlight. The Eos casts a far enough beam to see curves, puddles, and imperfections in the surface several feet ahead. My average speed is usually 11-13 mph. If I was moving at a faster pace, I'd want a brighter light with longer, wider beam, but this does the job acceptably.I considered a brighter rechargeable HID at twice the price but the 2-3 hour runtime on most HIDs would leave me in the dark on long rides. Out of all the low-cost cycle lights I've looked at, this is easily the best. Its also very light and easy to mount on a helmet or handlebar. I do wish it was a tiny bit brighter for trail rides, but its more than adequate for urban cyclists. Its probably not bright enough for mountain biking."
2,"Ehh, not that good.","Don't get me wrong, I love Eminem, and this CD is great. But not this version. Definitly get the unedited version. Much better. The best songs on the unedited are Lose Yourself, Rabbit Run, R.A.K.I.M., Spit Shine is the best. 50 Cent is terrible. He only talks about himself. I mean, it seems like he's happy he got shot nine times. Personally, I would be happy if he got shot ten times. And if one of the bullets was about an inch higher. One of the bullets in his mouth woulda killed him if it'd been an inch higher, I heard."
2,book i purchased,"I am sorry but i was dissapointed in the fact that, the description of the book was not accurat. i returned the book because in the footnotes before purchasing the book it said it was unclear that my purchase was a study guide and not the actual textbook. for future reference advertise your book as a study guide because it seemed to me like it was the actual text book. you might say its might fault, but im pretty sure not because i also purchased the study guide from another vendor that stated it was a study guide. in other words i was stuck with two study guides for your lack of information."
3,Not the ADF style I had hoped,"Well written, with a good eye for wit and humor as usual by ADF, but I couldn't seem to care for either Cheelo or Des, there is not really an effort by ADF to make you like them..."
4,Back to his and homanx' roots,"Having read nearly all books of ADF, I am very glad about his return to the Homanx area, where ADF really has his most intensive moments. The story is tough, sometimes moving, even thrilling and leaves me curious for the sequels. Des and Cheelo are interesting characters, especially the always enjoying way of getting to know a thranx personality (well done, ADF !). My best moments: seeing Amazonian nature (as I have already seen live) through the eyes of Cheelo (kind of alter ego of Alan, I presume) and even more through the multiple eyes of Desvendapur. I don't want to tell too much, it's just a little bit sad, never to hear again of Cheelo & Des... Keep on, Alan !"
4,My 8yr-old niece loved it,"The crazy names the grown up uses to describe the dances got a laugh out of us and my niece did the routines over and over again. She especially loved the hip hop routine. Each routine gets done a couple of times and gives the kids enough time to practice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got it for her as one of her Christmas gifts and she did it for weeks non-stop, but was tired of it by the time her 8th birthday came around in March. But I guess that's how kids are, right? Lol"
2,a new low,This was the worst book in the series. Why you ask? Because it was boring. Dull. I just couldn't get into it. Everything about it was boring. In fact the only reason I'm even going to read the last two books in the series is because of the time I've invested this far. (and I never did see the Spanish conquistadors mentioned on the back cover)
4,Grand Dames,"If you are over thirty, and female, you will either recognise yourself in one of the characters of the Grand Dames, or you will recognise friends. Brilliant characterisations. I was hooked after 5 pages."
4,Worth the Read,"This book was definitely a page turner. After 500+ pages, I was disappointed it was ""over."" Following these four women for more than a decade, Fielding keeps the reader riveted to the page as we laugh, cry and gasp as their stories unfold."
5,Great Reference Book,I was amazed when I got this book and read it. It was just full of so much informationa dn beautiful pictures. I am new to gardening so I found it to be extremly helpful fo me in that area. This is a keeper! I highly recommend it.
1,Avoid being ripped off!,The images on this CD are of such poor quality that I would not want to use them on any material that was associated with my name or my business. All of the images look like they are badly out of focus or were produced using photographic and/or scanning equipment of incredibly poor quality. It's difficult for me to believe that the professional photographers who originally took the photographs allow their names to be used on such poor quality reproductions. Don't waste your money on this CD. You will be very disappointed.
5,really cool!,I used this to outline words and an arrow on an 8ftx4ft canvas. I painted over regular black house paint and fluorescent green spray paint. It dries a yellowish color and if you want the glow in the dark to really show you need several coats (4-5 on the black) but it was definitely worth it! The paint goes on easily and dries fast.
2,Dirty girls finally get zapped. ZBOP!,"This movie was the feature attraction at a recent bad movie night with my friends, and with good cause. The premise is that a guy whips up this device that controls women's sexual urges at his very whim. That's it. Really. Little motivation is included in his playtime, but who really expects any? One remark I had was something about there not being enough plot to carry the film for a full 90 minutes, and I was right. Some thing to look out for: The underground lair where some strange sacrifice is taking place during which the box gets put to use; and the watercolor paintings reflecting some of the film's most powerful scenes (probably the highest-budget part)."
3,guerin sizzles,"this film is by no means a classic, but if you would like to see the sexiest woman alive, then this is perfect for that purpose."
5,Fantastic reference,"For anybody interested in making metal handplanes, this book gives complete directions. Including, history, technique, materials, etc. Beautiful color photos of the authors handiwork too."
3,Indianapolis HipHoppers Dont Sleep On These Kids.,"Aaight its like this yo,I am from indianapolis so i gotta show love to these kids for putting indy down so lovely.This is exactly what i am feeling right now,beats and rhymes,its that simple,but you gotta make the beats dope like el-mass who musta dug outta similar crates as Mood,another dope group from the midwest reppin' cincinnati.As for the rhymes,cHoc,puts down lyrics that make you rethink what y'all think hiphop is about.Its not about the money,not about the fame,but rather its about dropping conscience lyrics,and maintaing a dying art of being dope on the mic,something a lotta rich mc's forgot about after their first ASCAP checks rolled in.Anyways this cd shows that mc's from all over can make dope records check out freekya,rap can do,and i met this kid for proof.This should define the indianapolis hiphop movement .Fake mc's beware.Aaight...........Chill. Tak317 aka B.I.G. Don"
2,"Friction, but not fire.","BORING!!!!! Sorry Shark Quest, but compared Gods & Devils, this album falls flat. While I know for a fact that everyone playing on this album is creative, quite talented, and perfectly capable of enthralling an audience, they never quite seem to lay down anything worth mentioning on this album. Many tracks appear to be traveling towards something remarkable, but get a flat tire before arriving at their destination. Perhaps the title refers to the fact that band members were battling one another when composing tracks. If so, this power struggle resulted in friction, but not fire."
3,Found myself wanting a more Nick Twispian flair,I was really disappointed with this one. I read Youth In Revolt and Revolting Youth. They were both hilarious and they really got me excited about this one. The description of the book was pretty funny but I just haven't been able to get in to it. It does have funny parts and I am not saying it is bad but it is just not my thing.
1,Poor Customer Service,"I have a different Fontaine faucet, actually, but we had a problem with water flow. I contacted a couple of plumbing places, and they didn't carry any Fontaine parts, so I contacted the company directly. We corresponded about the part, and then I heard nothing for a week, so I contacted them again. Customer service said they were sorry, but they'd forgotten to send it - they would send it immediately! Three weeks later, I still have no part and no working kitchen sink! Now they haven't responded to me contacting them. We loved the faucet, but it's not worth the money if I can't get any replacement parts! Save your money and go with another company!FYI: Their customer service number is 800-476-2950. Email address: CS@fontainefaucets.com - that's for customer service. Not that it'll do you any good..."
1,Clunky and inaccurate,"Urgh! Not the program I had hoped for.The scanning part is fairly straightforward, but even with clean original scanned music, Photoscore 3's recognition is pretty bad.However, you can then go through the music, correcting errors in each bar as you go (they get highlighted in red, although you've still got to look out for the misread/missed notes/rests).This process was almost enough to make me throw the computer out the window... the editing process is clunky and non-intuitive. It seems partially linked to the Sibelius tools, but unfortunately not in full. This would make the editing process much simpler and quicker, but it seems you've got to use the Photoscore editing tools before you can export a correctly timed score into Sibelius or other program."
3,Interesting but improbable,"It reminded me a little of Shane, the story of a killer trying to leave behind his past. The reasons for his being hunted after so many years were never made clear. The main character's abilities were highly exagerated - a 50 year old man spends days on strenuous hike, than runs 40 miles (!) in 6 hours and has enough left to take on all the bad guys single handed."
4,interesting new direction...,"simply put, this is an ambient version of ""cassette"".. but that is a good thing, because SND are positioning themselves slightly towards a larger audience by making their sound a little (just a little!) more friendly and less monotonous. Imagine ""cassette"" with almost no kick drums, some pads (!) and some trace melodies. The second half is just fantastic. If you put that together with the best tracks of ""cassette"", then you would have one hell of an album.its worth checking out if their last album caught your ear.."
1,Wrong Book,This isn't East of Eden by John Steinbeck. It's a quickie guide designed to help students write papers on East of Eden without actually reading the book.
5,I was in this band and it was awesome.,"It's all part of My Rock and Roll Fantasy, I met The Victims Family, My favorite band on Earth, and started jamming with Larry. I moved to California and Ralf joined us. Larry Played Drums, I played Bass, and Ralf played guitar, mostly.Ralf is currently in Jello Biafra's new band, Jello Biafra and The Guantanamo School Of Medicine, Larry is one of the best bands on the planet, Tri-clops, and I play in Crapulence, and SEIZURES! find this band and the new bands on tardspace and rock this stuff out. cheers, Jason."
3,Crimper,"I have only had this for two days, but have yet to figure how how to get the best design to show up. I tried it on two different hair types, mine which is thick and my daugther who has thin little girls hair. Neither, seems to do better. Hope I can get it to work tomorrow morning....."
5,Works as promised.,"I've had this wine cellar for two months now and it has been perfect. It holds a nice, steady 51 degree temp and makes less noise than the PC sitting nearby. I may buy another as a Christmas present."
4,live is best,"This is a good CD, I spent my ""formative"" years in Lawrence KS where they originated and can tell you that the live shows are infinitely better than the CDs however this is some great work by Ernie and the gang. I've struggled for years to find a band to compare them to and can't, sorry. Perhaps they are a slightly more ""bluesy"" version of Reverend Horton Heat with just as much attitude...but that's not right either (closest I can come). Blasting harmonicas and heavy guitars is about what you end up with. It's blues meets hard rock meets local bar. I imagine this is what Led Zeppelin would have sounded like to the first people who heard them, no band to compare them to (not making a comparison on their sound, just how original they are). I think their earlier work was a better but more raw and not nearly as refined as they are on this CD. If you listen to Pawn Shop and aren't immediately moved to play it over and over then this is NOT the band for you."
4,A detailed history of the science of physics,"Mr. Thorne offers insight into an important world of science that only a person who has first hand experience could. While this book is a book about black holes, it is just as much a book about the science leading up to the ability of science to recognize and study them. It is very detailed with numerous ""boxes"" that include extra information. While it is not necessary to have an extensive science background in physics/astrophysics etc..., it would help. If one gives the book the patience that it takes, a world of information is available. It is not a quick read, but it is very interesting stuff no doubt."
5,Mind-Boggling,"This is a great book on its subject. It somehow gets across the key ideas of black holes and general relativity while showing a glimpse of the intricate mathematics behind the scenes. I wish I understood the details well enough to go where the notes point to, but this book does a great job of guiding me through the shallow waters."
5,Good for specialists too!,"Kip Thorne wrote a magnificent book. Though I work on this area I learned quite a bit. Particularly outstanding is the description of how the whole thing of Hawking radiation was born, starting from the ideas of the great, ebullient russian physicist Zel'dovich. The analogy Zeldovich found between electromagnetic waves emitted from a conducting rotating sphere and the waves (which should be ) emitted by a rotating black hole is so aptly dercribed taht I had to stop reading to try my hand on its consequences. I told about this to a former student of mine, then at Brown University, and he eventually produced a paper based on it!"
5,Great AC for HP laptop,"This AC Adapter is better than the original from HP. Great price, no complaints at all. I use the one from HP for like 3 months and suddenly the AC stop working."
1,Cute radio.,The radio is durable and does pick up most radio stations. The volumeis adjustable enough were you can hear it over the shower. Good buy for Scoobydoo lovers.
3,Pretty good account of the Ayatollah of the Rocky Mountains.,"I found this book informative and yet very readable. It is not intended as overly indepth book on Brigham Young but all in all it's good starting point. I applaude the author as a BYU proferssor he does not deny the Adam-God Dcotrine that Young taught as opposed to Spencer W. Kimball who said the the doctrine was ""allegedly taught""."
3,Boreing.,The review of this movie gave the impression it was a good story. The movie was actually boring not meeting expections.
3,TOOOOO Short,These boat plugs are just too short to be very secure in a boat hull. What is wrong with making them a bit longer???
1,One day I will be able to see this movie,"As this is the only place this movie can be purchased, the method of sales must accompany the review.I cannot view this movie, although I have paid for it. This ""unbox"" system has been completely useless for me, and I cannot get the movie, although it is paid for.I truly wish it was made available in another format, as the help to get it has been worthless as well.In short, make sure to try out this system of amazon's before buying the movie.There is no help desk, no assistance, and no movie, for me at least."
4,I can't believe only one person has reviewed this.,"The unbearable Dave Matthews band gets so much attention, while this beautiful work of art is ignored? The music here is like a romantic walk through Central Park on a cool, crisp day in October. It's got the great, late Joe Henderson doing some fine work and Gil Evans trumpet player Johnny Coles laying down some melodic sounds. In fact, the album was influenced primarily by Evans. If you want some soothing sonic brilliance to keep you company, give this a try."
3,Accusplit Pro Survivor S3CL Stopwatch,"Although the stopwatch works as advertised, it arrived with a dead battery! I was not a ""happy camper"". Any savings which I thought I was receiving, was quickly removed after spending approximately $5 for a new battery."
2,already past it's free service date,"I didn't read the reviews and was swayed by the large display and silent operation. It does achieve both of those advertisements. However, it arrived on so don't know how long it has been on. Embossed on the back of the case is the ""5-year NO-Proof-Of-Purchase Limited Warranty"" and the following info:Through Mar 2009/Free serviceApr 2009-Mar 2013/$10 Fee for serviceAfter Mar 2013/$10 fee service may not be availableAs this arrived 7/23/2010 I assume I will not get any free service if needed, and have already lost almost 1 1/2 years of the $10 fee for service. I would also assume it has been turned on for at least two years. I understand why so many people receive theirs with dead batteries.I will keep it as it is functioning and has the large display. I am disappointed because I buy a lot from/through Amazon and this is only the second time I have not been totally satisfied. With all the negative comments I am surprised Amazon still uses this supplier."
2,Quiet Stopwatch with Flaws,"I bought this stopwatch to keep accurate time during testing. A great plus is that it is silent. The stopwatch does not make any beeping sounds.But there were two significant negatives. First the battery lasted less than 5 months before dying on me. Second, the buttons need very hard presses. Sometimes I need to press the start/stop button twice for the press to register."
5,Awsome Book,The writting style allows all of us to get up to speed. i have been programming VB for almost 4 years and never have i learned so much in a book. From begining to end this was fun and a intresting romp. While some of the features could have showed us how to save a game to a file format that way we could have saved state machine he gives most of us WHO understand programming a canvass to unleash our thoughts. However the game engeinering chapeter could have had a sample Design Doc or more accuratly depict what a design document should be.
1,Why waste your money?,Why spend any money at all on this thing when you can download a Playstation Emulator and have EVERY GAME work perfectly! The emulators even have a gameshark!!!!!!I would think twice before buying this........
4,Can be a bear to work with...,"But it is really a fun yarn when it's done. The Tangerine yarn is a great, true orange. Vibrant. Obnoxious. And fun!"
1,"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","This is takes horrible to a new level! On a 1-5 scale I give it a -9999999. The graphics are bad, spiderman's and everyone else's moves are limited, the sound effects are....(lets not even go there) and the game is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. You would get frustrated, you would be ripping your hair out......... basically your life will get miserable. You will keep loosing no matter how hard you try. Even if you use a game genie. WHO THE HELL DESIGNED THIS VIDEO GAME? I WOULD LOVE TO KNOCK THEM OUT!!!!!!!!!"
2,I haven't gotten a chance to use it!!,"The thermometer came with the line of mercury separated from the main line of mercury at both the high and low ends of the thermometer. We tried all the things recommended in the instructions to fix the problem, and nothing has worked. I have tried calling and emailing the company to get help, and get no response. I am very frustrated with the product as it was to be a Christmas present for my 85 year-old father. Am looking into returning it to you and getting another one as replacement."
2,A good book for children who want to know about networks,"If you don't know anything about networks, this is a good book to start with. It has clear concepts and graphics to help understanding. Even a child can understand the whole book. About the depth of the concepts, I'd say it's a book for children."
1,Spastic!,I purchased this for some variety in my workouts. It was horrible! All three workouts are extremely dated. Kathy and her w/o buddies leave a lot to be desired. They are not in sync and they move like jumpy robots. Spastic is the first word that comes to mind when describing this workout. Kathy is not good at leading or announcing upcoming movements. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,Echo of the elephants,"The product came later in the mail than originally said and the cover was a bit crinkled up, but it was a gift for my grandmother who really enjoyed it so overall it worked out well."
4,Excellent,"Although some of the songs are the same as on previous Club Anthems CDs, it is definately worth buying. I bought the CD in England and it has all of the songs we danced to at the clubs. 666, Derude, Moby and others all make me want to get out of my chair and dance. There are a few songs that I could do without, and some that I would like to have included, but it is still worth the price (which isn't bad for 2 CDs). Better yet, take a trip, hit some clubs, and buy the CD there!"
2,Disappointed!,"I really think this CD was poorly titled. I picked it up because the title was exactly what I was looking for... the best club anthems ever.I tried to judge the disc by what songs I did know on it, and hoped that all the other stuff was as good or better. I was actually excited that there was so much music on the disc that I didn't know.I already knew and liked the songs by Delerium, Zombie Nation, Darude, etc... but very little of the stuff I didn't already know was any good at all."
4,Nice scent,"Bought for my husband who is a cologne collector. We both like the scent, although it is a little heavier than expected. I tend to like his Galltier and Guerlain fragrances a bit more. He liked the unique bottle also."
1,Not worth your money!!,Weak weak smell. Disappears almost instantly. Aptly name Aqua- it's like spraying water.Not worth the money at all.Never buy this product again.
4,Hunted by N. M. Browne,"The book Hunted is about a young girl (Karen) that sets out on the adventure of a lifetime while her body lies in a hospital bed. I found that Hunted tugged at all the emotions that could be felt. As I flew through the book I could feel just as she felt, so much that I would forget that I was reading it and just feel that I was in it. I felt it so much that I was there with her feeling the pain, agony, and utter instinct to survive. It was so good that I didn't want to put it down, but mysterious enough to always keep you wondering what the next page would bring. I feel that this is a good book for people who consider themselves one with nature."
3,I like alfa matrix releases but ...,I've bought multiple other compsilations from Alfa Matrix (including Endzeit ... 1 and 2) and enjoyed them but this one disappointed me.
4,This watch is exactly what I needed at the hospital.,"This watch is a good buy for the price. I was impressed when I received it, and I'm glad I chose it. It's light weight watch, the screen' size with the numbers is perfect to see when I'm working at the hospital measuring blood pressure and other vital signs. I can easily move it upwards on my arm when I'm working with the patient and it doesn't interfere on my way especially if I'm washing my hands. I recommended for nursing students. Only one problem I have found is that my expensive watches are now in my closet because I'm using it everyday."
4,Just what I wanted,"This Timex is good looking; the day, date, and time are easy to read; and the style is bold--exactly what I wanted. The battery lasts 10 years, and you can light the dial when it's dark by pushing in on the stem. I would rate it 5 Stars if it hadn't been so difficult to remove a couple of links in the expansion band. It was worth the trouble, but it was a challenge. This is a great watch for sports and casual wear, and the price is right."
3,Timex watch,The watch keeps time and does what I need from it. The band is too tight and I dread going to a jeweleer to replace it. The band will cast more than the watch!
5,Timex Easy Reader,"I bought this watch because of the Easy reader, both during the day and night with the blue light.-I LOVE IT !Hard for me to take it out.- Nice look. I wear it all the time , for work, and even at home."
2,Times T20461,Decent watch. Very annoying/difficult to set the day/date. Easy to see and fits well. Not easy for a senior to adjust the day/date without assistance.
3,Timex T20461 East Reader,"The good and the bad. The watch is just what my husband needed for work, inexpensive and easy to read, a workhorse of a watch. Setting it was a problem. Did not go according to directions. Finally left the day out which he didn't really care about anyway. The expansion band fit perfectly, which was a blessing. We thought we would have to take it to a jeweler for adjustment. The shipping was free and prompt. All in all, he is happy with the watch."
1,Poor Quality,"Just received the watch, and after carefully reading the instructions, cannot set the day function. The watch is supposed to be able to be read in the dark, I cannot, again after carefully reading the instructions, turn on the light function. Since the watch is relatively cheap, I will not return it. Not like my old Timex"
5,first rate,"My husband loves this watch. It is easy to read for those with poor eyesight, and the light is an added plus. I was surprised that it was so inexpensive. The quality is very good, and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,band is very uncomfortable,This is the most uncomfortable watch band I have ever owned. Should have gotten the leather band.
3,Didn't work,"I gave this to my Dad. We removed the plastic tab to jumpstart the battery, but it didn't work. My Dad wanted to keep the watch and replace the battery, however the timex box was crushed somewhat during delivery, so I returned the watch and choose another. Just to be on the safe side."
5,Nice watch,"I bought this for my husband. He likes the large, easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable. A very nice watch at a reasonable price."
1,Regret purchase,"I wanted an inexpensive easy to read watch, and got this watch. The stem pulled out of the watch the first time I tried to set it.Amazon sent another and I returned the first.After 4 months of operation, the 10-year battery was dead. I opened the back and removed the battery. It measured 1.3 volts on my meter. If good, it should have been about 3 volts.Maybe my luck was bad, getting two clunkers in a row. But I don't trust this watch now."
4,Usual Timex Top Quality,Watch serves my purposes very well. Wrist band could have been a tad larger. Otherwise an excellent choice. Kub
4,great toy for hours of fun,when I bought this toy I had no idea it would be such a big hit for my 3 year old. She has not put it down for 3 days. She has taken it everywhere. I love it because it is only water and so it can't mess anything up. My only complaint is that it won't last. It is holding up now but because it is made with cardboard backing it can't take the water forever. When I compair it with a color book or other art item it is worth it because they keep on doing it over and over. And it lasts about as long. If your going on a trip or something and you need a project to do on a plane or in a car. I highly recomend buying this item.
2,Stick with the book!,"I have used the book by the same name in working with clients, and have found it to be one of the best sources available on understanding anger and learning new skills. So I had high hopes for this audio CD, and thought it might be useful with clients who were less inclined to read a book. I am very disappointed. The information provided is very basic, and he takes forever to get to the ""meat"" of the material, and then doesn't spend enough time on the important parts. In one part he goes on and on about the importance of exercise, diet, and sleep, and in another part he goes on and on about keeping a diary of your anger, and how you could do it in a notebook or on a computer, etc. Like he is speaking with kindergartners. My husband and I were sitting here laughing because we were becoming quite irritated by listening to the CD!! Do not waste your money on this -- stick with the book, which is excellent."
4,Electronic Drumsticks,"Graet price, shipping a few days longer than I thought. Product hooks up to many other electronics you can use it with. My grandson seems to love it,"
3,Very basic drumming sounds,"At first glance, you think...'Dang, I'm going to be bustin' outs some awesome drum beats with these sticks.' Unfortunately that's not the case. Since each sound is produced with only 1 stick (either the left or the right) you can't get any rolling type sounds. You can actually bust out better beats tapping with your hands on a table or your lap. Also, the sound isn't produced by tapping the sticks on a surface. You have to actually air drum so your timing can be slightly off. It's like playing the drums on one of those a digital keyboards except you do a drumming motion instead of tapping a keyboard key."
2,Too many mistakes,There are countless errors in sentence choices for this workbook. This makes it hard to learn correct english grammar.
3,Entertaining yet REPETATIVE,"One thing the creators of this game obviously didn't spend to much time on was variety. It took me 4 days to completely beat and in short, the game went kind of like this; stop an armored car robbery, save an idiot hanging off a building, chase a balloon, chase a car, save an idiot hanging off a building, stop a cop shooting, chase a car, stop an armored car robbery, CHASE BLACK CAT, chase a balloon - u get the idea. So my main concern is why the missions were hardly thought through! MAN THAT ANNOYED ME! Yet i must say that the graphics were impressive along with the geography and a couple fighting moves. So basically, if u can't get enough of this game, playing it's demos at stores, at ur friends house, at the mall, ..............DON'T BUY IT!!! just do what i did and rent it for a couple days. trust me it isn't worth the mula. and u'll beat it in a couple days anyway! so for your sake, DON'T BUY THE GAME"
5,totally effective,"I've tried samples of this herb a couple times,...it is the bomb!Totally works. Obviously its not healthy to be going out drinking to the point that you have a hangover,...but hey if its your birthday and you're hitting the bar,,,,a nice thing to have on you. Sadly, its very hard to find in any store."
4,Nice product,"The Pro Survivor is somewhat better than the survivor because it offers extra shock resistance; more water resistance; no fail switches and an extra large display. The XL display was important for me. The watch is simple. It measures minutes, seconds and 1/100 seconds up to 40 minutes, then it only measures hours, minutes and seconds. The time and date features were not important to me. It has a five year warranty without proof of purchase."
5,Coach loves it!,"Bought this for a college baseball coach and he absolutely loves it! We recommend this product, and love forward to using it everyday."
1,Seller was less than honest and unresponsive,"The stopwatch is great. The seller sent a really old manufacture, so old the 5 year warranty was expired. It was obvious since the manufacturer put the warranty expiration date on the back of the stopwatch. The seller has been unresponsive. I am wondering how long the batteries will last. Be careful who you buy from!"
5,A Surprisingly Good Vampire Story,"It is hard to find a vampire story that is actually good, what with all the Twilight stuff going around. This is a character based story revolving around Jiro and his little brother. It takes place in a world where people know about vampires, but chose to co-exist. Jiro and his brother are trying to get to the ""Special Zone"" (a place where vampires are welcome) but run into problem along the way and afterwards. There is also a fair amount of comedy in it, a rare thing in most American vampire stores, but common in anime. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of vampires or anime. It will probably convert you to the other depending on which one you started from."
1,"""Live Trucker""","""My friend waited by his computer for like 2 days to get this album and when he made me listen to it I really didn't like it. I'm not really a kid rock fan so maybe that is why i did not like it. he loves kid rock so naturally he like it. He said it the best think he has ever listened. If it were up to me i would not get this CD, I would spend the money on something else like a multi-platinum selling Tupac CD."""
1,Only God Knows Why.........This Album Was Ever Made,"Don't take this the wrong way, I am a Kid Rock fan. However-This CD absolutely stinks. I was really looking forward to this CD, I thought this would be a great rocking live album. What it is is an incredibly boring waste of time and money. Even Kid Rock sounds bored as he gives uninspired performances of some of His hits. I honestly can't think of one single good thing to say about it. Go buy David Allan Coe. Go buy Hank Williams III or Hank Williams Jr. Go to see Disney On Ice. Just don't waste your money on this crap."
5,Rocking out !,"The Live Trucker album explains the real Kid Rock, true blue. You get alot out of his music and showmanship. He's very talented and a great song writer, get this Live album, and see his concert."
4,EXCELLENT TRUE METAL!!,"ironically,one may enjoy this the most being ignorant to the fact that the twin guitar GODS on this disc are the dudes from Mercyful Fates glory days.Being familiar with Fate,one cannot help but try to measure this release with that of earlier,and yes superior,releases.so now that we have that out of the way,buy this album NOW!!it is a well constructed TRUE metal disc that will grow on you more and more with repeated listens.it truly is great to have Denner and Shermann recording together again to show the majority of todays crap-guitarists how it's done!!"
3,I expected more,"Given the praise for the book I guess I was expecting more. As noted by another reviewer, it seems that Mark Wetmore over trains his runners as evidenced by the stress fractures and injuries that plagued that season. The author mentions Wetmore pondering whether he is training them too hard. It would have been interesting to compare the training of the NCAA Champion Team from that year (Arkansas) vs. what CU was doing. The writing style was a bit odd as well. It sometimes read like a police report of events that happened at certain times. Kind of like ""4:30pm Men run Mags and die in the process"" etc. Overall, it was good to read but not my favorite."
3,Rather get the Very Best Of compilation,"This collection includes three chart hits: the title track, What Are You Doing Sunday and the classic pop number Knock Three Times - a massive hit in 1971. The rest is made up of cover versions of classic compositions from the 1970s like Laura Nyro's Up On The Roof, James Taylor's Carolina In My Mind and others. These are fairly straightforward pop interpretations of much covered songs, so nothing special and not worth pursuing in my opinion. To get the real meat by Dawn, it's best to get the Very Best Of compilation with the above-mentioned hits plus Tie A Yellow Ribbon, Strawberry Patch With Sally and Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose. I loved the sound of Dawn when I was a kid and still appreciate this kind of melodic vocal pop."
5,Nostalgic and alot of fun,WOW!This takes me way back to my childhood! I loved it then and I still do!Shirley Jones was and still is a beautiful woman.Looking forward to the 4th and final season
2,Season Three? Nah.,"Alas, my five year old daughter has outgrown the Partridge Family before the release of season three."
1,don't buy this book,"i don't recamend buying this book. I got it for my birthday last year and from my uncle right after i purchased my new g4. the book taught me nothing. nothing was totally new in the os and if it was, it was easy to use. therefore, all you need is common sense in this case. save your money."
2,Furi Ozitech revision ruined the sharpener.,"I had been giving these as gifts, and used them myself for some years. The last order or two Ifound the sharpening stones are applied 1/4 of an inch down from the top. This forms an edgethat the knife edge hangs on and instead of sharpening it dulls the blade. It is a shame thatafter making a great product a manufactering change ruins it. I will no longer buy these due tothe above."
4,Good sharpener,"Purchased this item as a gift for my parents. They love it for keeping knives sharp, but it doesn't work as good on very dull knives. Very easy use. They are happy with it."
3,"Nice, but poor design","The sharpener works fantastic, no complaints what-so-ever. The issue is the plastic housing around the sharpener is really poorly designed and cheap. My wife broke off one of the plastic hinges the first day because it is so ridiculous to open and close. Now I just sharpen a knife deal with the shoddy design and throw it back in the drawer - it does what I need it to do, that's the bottom line."
4,sooo easy,"The knife sharpner, is so easy to use. You first must open properly and it's ready to go. No matter what, or how you use it it sharpens everything, sharper than new. I love it. Finally, one that is easy and truly works."
2,Didn't find this good for really dull knives,"I wish I could write a rave review on this product, but I can't. I will say the device is lightweight, has a great design and is easy to use, but I found the product to be ineffective on sharpening really dull knives. The directions I received with the sharpener also stated that extremely dull knives may need additional professional preparation. I used this product on dull old Chicago Cutlery and Henckels knives and received little results."
4,"Works well, easy to use","Easy to use, does a good job. Would give it 5 stars if it did serrated knives."
4,Best $20 knife sharpener in the world!!,"Too bad it costs $35. I like this knife sharpener and us it as my primary but, I just can't see the premium Furi or Rachael Ray adds to the price."
3,book has arrived,"...., a follow up to a previous posting. My order arrived today, one month and a day after placing it."
2,Paws & Claw my eyes out!,"I got this game as a bonus to a used Game boy advance system. I have been clicking my way all around the game for a while now. I see that there is cats, dogs and horses but I am still on the rabbit stage. I am still trying to satisfy the 6 rabbits taken in and returned requirement. There is no explanation about what the different codes mean and how to boost them up. I am new to the world of GBA and I hope that there are other more fun games around."
1,Don't get suckered into this one,"I'm a professional audio engineer for a church that seats over 2,000 people in the main sanctuary. This book is literally the Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook with chapters torn out of it and an intro written for churches. If you're looking for a reference guide for audio , just get the Sound Reinforcement Handbook. Don't waste your church's money on this, it's lacking quite a bit."
5,Fallen Angel,"This book was the first Kurt Cobain book I read and being a graphic, interested me. It still is the only Kurt Cobain book I've read as I only read it a couple of days ago.I think the authour and the illustrator really hit the point and got the message across. Flameboy is a very tallented illustrator, I think he really captured what Kurt must have been feeling at that time. Also, the authour uses very simple yet effect words and phrases, whether Kurt acctually used there I don't know but I think they create a really good blunt and shocking effect in parts.Overall I love this book, I think its a relly visual insight into Kurts downfall that perhaps explains more and is easier to interpret.R.I.P Kurt Cobain"
4,LOVED everything but the luminosity,"I found this watch to be nearly flawless when it arrived: perfect size, style, finish and functions. Everything about it was of a very high quality, and at $140, it was an amazing deal. I love that it has both the date and day of the week, and I love the traditional diver dial. The watch almost perfectly filled my needs, but sadly, I had to return it based on one major (for me anyway) flaw: while the hands glow very brightly in the dark, the hour markers are almost invisible, even after a fresh charge in bright light. I'm not sure if I got a defective watch, or if this is the standard for this model.For anyone not concerned about glow-in-the-dark performance, or if you don't mind only seeing the hands at night, you'll be very happy with this watch. I wish the luminous paint had been applied to the markers too, because I was really sad to let this one go."
4,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT! 4 1/2 STARS,"i DON'T DO THE LONG DRAWN OUT REVIEWS AS SOME OF MY COUNTERPARTS SO READ THEIRS IF YOU WANT DETAILS. GENE STARWIND IS SOOOO COOL REAL AND LIKEABLE. GREAT SUPPORTING CAST, PLOT AND VISUALS. ONE STRANGE EPISODE I BELIEVE IT'S # 11 OR 13 (NOT FOR KIDS) BUT OVERALL GOOD STUFF. IF YOU LIKE ACTION, THIS IS YOUR SET."
2,Good show but problem with the package.,I've always liked the show Outlaw Star... but when I received my order it only had 5 discs in it instead of the full 6. Not sure if anyone else has had this problem or believes me but just wanted to point that out.
5,Great For Sci Fi,"Sci Fi + Great Anime = freaking sweet. for a series of Anime this is short and sweet, but worth every dollar. I guess this is simmilar to Cowboy Bebop? Never seen it, but the story when you look at it is like one big movie all together thorughout the series, and I find myself watching one right after another. Its a great series! I love the episode where they enter the big race!"
2,"inconsistant, almost as if two people were writting this book","I picked up the book because I though that it had an interesting premise, but I think that it was disappointingly developed. Parts of this book are good, but overall there is no consistancy within the story, and some direct contradiction, almost as if there were two people writting on this book, neither of who reads what the other has written. Not always on minor things either, sometimes on major points. Also, sometimes effort will be made to develop a point, and then it is just dropped, never to be seen again. Could have been good, and probably could be edited into a good novella or short story. Can't recomend it as a novel though."
2,"No,No,No","I was looking for something dark and twisted. I got dark alright. 2/3rds of the book takes place in the dark in an underground cavern......Monotonous. Maybe Hell is supposed to bore you to death and that is the authors point. In which case, it's Genius!The description on the back of the book sounds good. It describes the first 3 chapters, which are excellent! Too bad the rest of the book is all downhill.....maybe that is why it is called ""The Descent""."
3,"Interesting, but not interesting enough","This book has great visuals. That is about the best thing I can say about the book. It really put some entertaining and interesting images in my head. There are a couple decent characters. You don't really meet one of the main characters till 150 pages in. That is just far too much for me, personally.It is a very interesting concept, and that is the only reason I kept pressing on. Eventually, I just couldn't take it anymore, as almost nothing was happening. I could only get through about half of it. I try to never do that, but The Descent gave me little options.If the idea interests you enough, and you have a good amount of time on your hands, give it a read. I am pretty confident that the second half of the book (that I did not read) was entertaining, but I just couldn't continue."
2,Too far from the Center,"Although the premise of the book is far from original, it does have some interesting moments. The book opens far too many avenues of possibilty that can not be fully explored in so short a treatment.It seems that Mr. Long gets a bit lost in his own abyss. We have a psycho-sexual element that begins to explore a dominant/submissive society of protohuman slavers that is hardly touched upon. The religious beliefs of early judeo-christian history that almost seems like a window dressing, and a bailout ending where the author seems to grab a handful of disjointed threads and tie them into a dubious conclusion.All I can say is it was a heroic effort, akin to free climbing El Capitan."
5,Absolutely the best book I've ever read.,"I've never read anything by Jeff Long, but this is ABSOLUTELY the best book that I've ever read. Long's intricate writing style completely wraps into his world. The background descriptions and dark overtone allows for an extremely real experience. I recommend this novel to anybody who is looking for suspense. The novel is not only entertaining, but extremely thought-provoking. I came out of this novel with different perspectives on many issues in life. Give this book a chance, you won't regret it."
5,Great Story,"I bought this book to take on vacation when it first came out, and have read it several times since. I don't care what the other reviewers have said, it is a great story, leaves you with a haunted feeling. It is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi horror."
4,Pretty darn good,"I bought this book (...) because it looked well above their usual selection. That it was. The concept of an ancient subterranean civilization was interesting, and much of the writing was exciting. It was overlong, and there were so many sublots that a number of loose ends remained. The ending was (I am sure) intentionally left somewhat ambiguous, and in such a way that it did not all hang together. The unintentional activation of the ""homing device"" by the two main characters, Ali and Ike, near the end of the book, seemed unlikely. The treatment of the reincarnation concept was also rather confused."
2,Interesting... implausable... unfulfilling.,"How are people supposed to breathe, five miles below the surface of the Earth?If Satan is really a living organic being, how has he managed to stay alive for tens of thousands of years?Why do people who spend a few years underground suddenly develop horn-like protrusions?Why would a multi-trillion-dollar excavation project send only a dozen people down as its top-level security force, and then not check in with them for months at a time.The answers to these questions and more are NOT in this book."
5,Awsome,This book is by far the best book I have ever read. I could not stop turning the pages....only hope that his next book is half as good !!!!
1,A book without a direction,"It's a science fiction novel!, no a fantasy novel, no a mystery....religous thriller......oh for cryin' out loud. The only thing worse than a book that is just downright lousy is one that starts out strong, draws you in then takes a plummet all the way....well to hell.If just one of those themes delivered anything of quality it might have been worth slogging through Jeff Long's long winded dialogue, chapters and weak plotting. Even skipping to the end will leave you with an incredibly absurd ending that comes out of nowhere with no support of the preceding pages."
2,My time would have been better spent reading something else,"The only reason that I finished reading the book was just out of morbid curiosity. I kept telling myself that it had to get better; it had to come together somehow, somewhere - - But... sadly it never did. The book jumped around without any congruity to the storyline. The characters were poorly developed, hard to identify with, and hard to keep apart from each other. Some of the characters tended to bleed over into each other making it difficult to know who was who. Couple this with a disjointed storyline and you have the makings of a complete dud!. This is the first book that I have read by Jeff Long, so I will not totally rule him out - - - just yet. Everyone gets a second chance. Hopefully ""Year Zero"" will be a better read. It at least sounds interesting; but then again, so did Descent."
2,Disappointing,"As others have written, when I saw the novels description, I had to order it immediately. Once I read the first chapter I was hooked. The entire premise of Hell being real and co-existing with Earth as we know it is an incredible idea. The idea of real devils capturing human beings and forcing them to be slaves and a real Satan is unreal. The problem is that halfway through the book the original premise is deserted and then the book becomes a novel of self sufficient preaching by the author on what's wrong with society. He totally abadons what started as an incredible idea.It has the makings for an incredible movie provided they write the screen play to focus on Hell being discovered and existing and a war for the human race.Very disappointing."
5,A Most Excellent Adventure into the Intellectual Dark Side.,"In many instances ""The Descent"" is one of the most intellectual books I've read. The depth of knowledge Mr. Long brings to this book is wonderfully refreshing. From Mythology, Religion, Philosophy, and History...the reader is taken on a journey through a wonderful tale of the Unknown."
2,"Great promise, empty reward",This could've been a great book and it was leading to a fantastic climax until it petered out like a car that's just run out of gas. Don't waste your time or money. Neither's worth reading this book.
5,"A ""classic"" Tish album for the Christmas holidays.","This is one of Tish's best efforts, a mix of Spanish and English lyrics in songs with a Christmas celebration theme. Her strong, beautiful voice, intelligent lyrics, and excellent guitar backup combine for a truly memorable album."
5,Beautiful!,"I already had 8 of these, but needed four more to set my dinner table. Absolutely stunning, heavy and well worth the price. My mother paid twice as much at a department store when she gave me her 8, so I lucked out! Use a little brass cleaner every year and the older ones still look like the ones I just bought. Would recommend. It so elegant and shows beautifuly under my fine china. The painted gold chargers that are available at the local stores, are not worth the price after seeing these. This will last a lifetime."
4,Great game,"This is is very, very good fighting game. Though the graphics could've used some work. It's really good that you can play as good characters. But there are secrets too. Like swithching costumes. If you switch Luke's costume, you'll switch to his Jedi Master lightsaber, too! Buy or rent. Rent first, then buy though."
3,"The Good, Bad & Ugly","I recently learned that Ennio Morricone had written some songs that I dearly loved. However, when I purchased the CD, I thought the music was grainy - like it was recorded off of an old soundtrack. I have heard better renditions."
5,poulan carb adjusting tool,"this was so simple,just what i needed for my chainsaw. couldn't find part anywhere, so this saved me from the small engine repair shop."
5,right tool for the job,arrived very quickly. The tool work perfectly try to adjust without it could not do it. what can I say it did the job
4,Hard To Do Without,This tool is exactly what I needed to be able to adjust the High and Low carburetor settings on a Poulan chainsaw. None of the local hardware or small engine repair shops would sell me the tool although they had access to them. Pretty dirty on the manufacturers part to sell a product that requires you to take it to a repair shop to adjust the carburetor.
3,don't fit adjusters,dosn't fit adjusters on the weedeater keep the adjuster as it cost more to send the item back then it's worth.I bought one from a local dealer .
5,Fits Poulan Pro Chainsaws,"Purchased this tool to adjust the carb on my 18"" Poulan Pro Chainsaw. It is a quality tool and works well. This is a must to own for adjusting Carbs on Poulan small engines."
5,A Masterpiece!!,"This is truely a masterpiece. I remember the first time I saw it I was touched deeply and yet terrified from the moving performance Maria Falconetti gave, in her only picture. The script was taken from the trial of Joan of arc. And I highly recommend this movie to all."
5,Best Silent Film Ever Made,"The best silent film ever made, and in my opinion one of the top 5 or 10 films of all-time. There are very few films that I can watch repeatedly, and this is one of them. A masterpiece. Totally original."
1,Do not buy,"This reference is filled with omissions and errors. If you do not know html, buy a commercial program that will do it for you. If you need a handy reference because you write code, you cannot use this because it is not describing the real world, but only the imaginary world of the authors. Look to Osborne's Programmers Reference for a better quick source."
3,Excellent product and price but the set up is difficult,Overall the product is excellent the only reason why i give a three start is setting up the whiteboard is a hassle and i spend a good 30 minutes setting up with the tools that come with the board but the good thing this board does not weight much and i was able to place in my wall by using exterior adhesive tape and it only took about two minutes. Another small detail in order for this board not to leave any ghost marks you must buy quartet dry erase markers any other brand will leave ghost marks. Overall i was satisfy with the product although I should have chosen a bigger size but the price and quality of the whiteboard does not make the seem like a big issue
2,new stuffed animals,"I am really sorry to say, but this book was a disappointment to me. Lots of pictures, but all small, odd-coloured (orange, reddish), straight from some old selling cataloques. The teddies were a minority compared to the other stuffed animals. Furthermore, there were not many pictures of the old Hermann teddies, the vast majority of the teddies were quite new or newer. I found the information part -values etc - rather strange and difficult to use."
2,Book Very Disappointing,"I purchased this book hoping to identify a Hermann original that I own. A great many of the teddy bear images look like they were taken with a red light bulb; consequently, they all look the same color. I found no way to identify my particular bear, because captioned under each image is just a number. No reference to a bear name, or other identifying information. My bear has the original tags, but no reference to a number on the tags, so this book is of very little use to me.As my title states, this book was a huge disappointment and I would never have paid over $20 for it."
5,Fabulous CD!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack, as I did the movie. Toby's singing, and songs, are superb, as usual. Lindsey Haun has a beautiful voice, and does a wonderful job on her songs. Flynnville Train is a very good southern rock band, and their song ""High on the Mountain"" lets the listener see how good they are! The song ""Uncloudy Day"" done by Toby, Willie Nelson, and Bebe Winans is a moving old-time gospel song, and I loved their performance of it. I recommend the CD whether or not you have seen the movie yet!Elsietee - TKIFC"
3,Not up to it's price,"The only reason I did not gave it one star is because I am a real Star Wars fan. The gameplay graphics are ok but could have been a lot better.Te soundtrack is quite innovative but the loops are simply annoying. Interface could have been a lot easier, specially construction interface.The command point system is interesting but it means once you start loosing the battle it is extremely difficult to turn the tide, even with superb strategies. On the oher hand Force Commander improves the Star Wars experience and the cutscenes are some of the best I have ever seen. But besides this, I have paid $20 for games of more less the same quality. Somebody should tell LucasArts that the fact it is part of the Star Wars Universe does not mean he can deliver a mediocre product and the public will accept it. I had enough with Rebellion and now this..."
5,this is great,ok i am a star wars zealot and the rating might have been a little do to the fact that i love star wars but i know a good game when i see it the interface is bad but everything else is great the clunk clunk of the AT-AT the look of the tie fighter.and the command points are a breath of fresh air.the single player mode is hard but not unbeatable.worth every bit of the money
4,Confusing but Great,Star Wars Force Commander is a great game and all. At first you think oh this game has great graphics with the 3D Acclerator. Afterwards the play control may seem hard but after a while it's not so hard. The plot is for any Star Wars fan who like Starcraft and Command and Conquer.
1,This Game is Really Bad!,"I bought this game based on a promotional e-mail from Amazon.com I received because I pre-ordered the Episode I movie........... I was a sucker and bought it. I HATE IT! It is hard to play and no fun at all. If you haven't bought it yet, don't!"
2,Not Cool....,"Im yet another Die-Hard Star Wars Fan. As soon as I heard of Star Wars: Force Commander, I instantly rushed too my local EB. I threw the CD in my 'puter and...waited... Once it was done I drooled at the prospect of commanding my troops into battle...as soon as i saw the first mission..my smile faded...graphics are ok sound is a knock off of Pearl Jam, and the camera stinks. If you buy this game, you have my pity my friend."
2,New to Computer Games? Don't Buy This,"As someone who used to play video games as a youngster, I was excited to initiate the process of picking the hobby back up as an adult. Being a Star Wars fan, the box this game comes in caught my eye. It made me think I would be able to jump right in and start fighting the enemy. I was extremely disappointed. This game is difficult to learn and boring. Unless you have hours and hours to invest and are easily amused, please take a pass on this one. I learned that one needs to read reviews of these games and target what you're looking for before jumping in and just buying the games off the shelf."
1,"ALL Bark, ZERO bite.","This game is the typical ""grab headlines and not deliver"" that I'm coming to expect from Lucasarts. This is an RTS 2 years behind in Technology. I've never understood how the Empire couldn't have a battlefield mapped, yet the ""ZERO FIELD OF VISION"" persists in this game. The controls are twitchy, and the graphics are can't even compete with lower class RTS games like Metal Fatigue. I bought the game b/c I'm a fan, but I'd rather spend my time reading the novels than play this poorly done amateurish shrink wrapped goop."
3,Falls flat...,"In the tradition of Warcraft and Age of Empires, comes Force Commander. You get the chance to control a fleet to do ground battle against (mainly) the Rebels. While this all sounds exciting, the controls and interface are not easy to master right away. The 3D graphics make the game harder to view rather than being an enhancement. If it were easy to control and view, this would be one of the best RTS games. Stick with Age of Empire."
1,Do Not Buy an LG Microwave,"This microwave has been nothing but trouble! It was recommended to me by the sales person at the appliance store. It didn't work properly from the time it was installed - it made a strange, loud noise and the sensor buttons (like the popcorn button) didn't work. After many, many visits from the repair people, the store finally replaced it. The new one was installed on a Tuesday and on Thursday the LED panel went out. I've waited and waited for the part and finally told the store to come and take it away. I plan to buy a new microwave and it certainly won't be an LG!"
2,I hope he got that out of his system.,"As a gifted musician, Chris Thile is one of those rare, incredible players that come along once or twice in a lifetime.While I understand the need to move along, to grow as a musician, I found this CD to be a disappointment in general, with just a few bright moments.As someone who owns almost all of Chris's discography, I was looking forward to hearing what he was up to these days. Cut after cut, I waited to hear the inspired, incredibly deep talent I've come to know and love... from as far back as his very first CD. But, he never really appeared.If you're thinking about buying this as your first exposure to Chris... do yourself a favor and don't. Instead, pick up ""Not All Who Wander Are Lost"", or ""Stealing Second"". Both are infinitely better than this, a lackluster effort at best."
4,Excellent mandolin playing!,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this cd, but I am so glad that I did. There are some amazing jam sessions on this cd and Chris' amazing talent is evident in these songs. Makes me glad to be a bluegrass/Nickel Creek fan!"
5,table review,I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase. Delivery was quick as well. This is a very sturdy table. I pictured the tile being broken upon arrival but this table was packaged approriately and nothing was broken.
4,good value for price,Needed an inexpensive side table that didn't look cheap. This table has a little personality as well.
2,unhappy,I purchased this adapter to allow connection of my DVR to my TV. It shows the picture but only in Black and white...I am very unhappy.
4,I AM JUST GOING TO....,"KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET... NICE CD.... I PICK UP TODAY... I AM SATISFIED TO THE MUSIC.. KEEP HIP-HOP ALIVE BAND.. GOOD JOB ON THIS PIECE OF WORK... AND NICE SHOUT OUT TO THE HEARDLESS HERO... ""JAY DILLA"" WILL BE GREATLY MISS... NICE WORK ROOTS.. LOVE YA.....!!!!"
4,More solid work from one of the greates Hip Hop groups of all time!,This Roots album gets off to a furious start and makes a pretty soft landing but overall I can say I like this album a lot. It is a little bit more dark than most of the albums but it some how work. Thank you Roots for more solid hip hop. Not quite Things Fall Apart or Do You Want more but still a great album. Oh and for those that have never seen The Roots live go see them!!
1,Waste of Money,I would never buy another Coby product. Believe all the negative reviews. The unit will start humming and then will stop playing. The CD playback was intermittant. The warranty is useless. I wish I read the reviews before I bought mine. After 92 day it is junk.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is my first product review ever. I'm only making the effort now because I don't want someone else to waste their money on this.I've only had it out of the box for 15 minutes, so I haven't even tried to hook up my mp3 player yet, although I've heard that's also a nightmare.All you really need to know about this product is that the sound is absolutely AWFUL. It doesn't even sound like it's in stereo. Unfortunately, there's no EQ to assist in that matter, either. I hooked up different speakers and it does improve the sound, but what's the point?"
1,Awful!,"I got this as a Christmas gift. Set it up, used it once or twice. Went to use it today. It is non-responsive. Apparently you are not supposed to leave it plugged in even when in the off position. I am furious.Now I get to find a new stereo."
2,brocken,when I got the item any cd put in refused to play.I tyed maybe five or six to no avail maybe this was just a one time occurance but I cannot recommend this product.
2,Keep Looking,"Looks like an attractive cd player, but the sound quality is very poor, it makes the cd skip if the volume is higher & the display is not only small but incredibly difficult to read. Not recommended"
2,It's pretty but sound is horrible and speaker's aren't flat,"This cd player looks great but the sound quality is very bad. I bought it for it's flatness and ability to hang on a wall only to open the box and realize the speakers are not flat at all and stick far out from the wall, defeating the purpose of purchasing a flat wall mounting cd player. The screws were so cheap that one broke off so now I can't unscrew it. The remote control makes a very loud click every time you press a button and the speakers hum even when there is no cd playing unless you completely shut off the power. It's pretty is about the only positive thing I have to say about this item. I would never recommend purchasing this item to anyone."
2,Outdated,Lots new features of JDK should be included.Too much author's personal idea which are really debatable. Do not consider every thing mentioned in this book should be followed.
3,"good book, but did not talk too much about memory","well, I agree with the previsous thought about this books it is very useful book. but I feel it less some topic about the memory management , of course it is a trade of between memory/speed, but it will be nice to talk them together."
2,Difficult to Use,"The basic idea of this grooming arm is good. But what you won't realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate. The clips are extremely difficult to open--in fact, they are IMPOSSIBLE for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands.It was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room, unused."
3,It works okay...,I bought this to help my metro dryer be hands free. this works okay. as good as it can i suppose. I recieved one that does not look like the picture. Not sure if thats a good or bad thing. Mine doesnt have a metal goosneck but rather a plastic one. it was cheaper than elsewhere..but wonder if i got ripped off by getting the one i did.
2,Doesn't work with most 82-02 GM Cars,"I bought this for a 99 suburban, and it only works with 89-91 suburbans. The Amazon 'find parts that fit your car' says it would fit but the manual clearly state what cars it works for. Most GM cars it will either not work for or only work with model years around 84-89."
1,horribly outdated,"This is the worst, most outdated guidebook I've ever come across. For the budget traveler, it is absolutely useless. The so-called ""best hotel on the corniche"" in Muscat turned out to be a dingy, roach-infested dive. The maps for Oman are minuscule, poorly drawn, and lack detail. The entire history of Oman is condensed into five pages. Don't waste your money on this guide. Oman is a very easy country to travel in, and you hardly need this guidebook. This is the sort of guidebook you find yourself leaving behind at your hotel. If Duabi is your destination, go with the newer ""Dubai"" guide. Pity, though, that Lonely Planet charges you the same price for a city guidebook as they do for a two-country guidebook."
5,Piaget's theory and the classroom practice,"This book explained Piaget's theory in different developmental stages clearly. The book offers educators how to apply his theory in teaching. It is a good book for people who are not familiar with Piaget's theory or for educators who are not sure how to apply Piaget's theory in classrooms. It is a good resource for those who would be interested in teaching children based on Piaget's theory, such as teachers and home schooling's parents. It is also a good textbook for college students."
3,great product - but the scent....,"Does the job well and holds shape. tube shape is a plus. The scent is not bad - but it gets to you after a while - meaning to say: it went in the garbage after a three days. for me, I would like more if it was un-scented . I wont buy this product again until they make a different scent. I now I use ""Handlbars"" which works well for me, and the scent is more ""manly"" and not over-powering."
5,All this father needs,"Holds all day, smells great and fits in my pocket for repairs on the go. You can't go wrong."
1,Bad smell,"This was my maiden voyage into the seas of mustache wax and I think my ship has sank. According to my girlfriend, it smells like a dirty hippy grandma's douche. But at least it had good hold..."
2,Not interested,"This kept my daughter interested for a whole 3 seconds. She was absolutely not interested in watching this. The music was a little out dated, as were the dance moves, and they are more for someone trying to learn a routine than someone trying to learn to dance."
4,Viking/Black Metal with a twist,"This has been my first chance to hear Enslaved, though I am familiar with many of their contemporaries. It seems that idealogically speaking, Enslaved has followed a similar path to that of Bathory/Quorthon, starting our Satanic and evil before getting into the heathenism of their Norse forefathers.In any event, it's nice to hear a band reared in the Black Metal movement that's not afraid to invoke some more traditional Heavy Metal elements, such as the Sabbath-like grind that pops up in track 3, ""Entrance-Escape."" The most surprising moment is when track 7, ""Det endelege riket,"" busts into an almost countryish interlude (I swear), and it doesn't sound the least bit awkward.Check this out if you like Black Metal, but are open to other types of music as well."
4,A Must Have Album for All Metal Fans!,"This is the first CD I have heard from Enslaved. I saw them earlier this year when they played with Destruction in SF. ""Mardraum"" is a great album from start to finish. Filled with a combination of black metal, viking metal, and incorporating some awesome atmospheric interludes, this album is a must have for all metal fans. The best song has to be track 2 ""Deadhym"". Easily some of the best guitar riffs I have heard in awhile. Buy this album."
4,pls read this for better understanding of the world as it exists now,"Do you want to know why the USA are rich and powerful and why Russia, for example, can't copy its way ? Why is export of formal institutions impossible in this world without considering ideology, mental structures and so on..And don't even try to force others to be like you, to eat hamburgers and drive fords. We are different! and it lies beneath - in history.It's the only positive and constructive idea that appears in ones mind when reading North. Let his theory be week and not scientific enough, let him mix neoclassics with institutional economics and history - this eclectics will do good for you as a killer of brain limits.peace!"
4,"Ask the experienced, not the learned.","When Don wrote this book he was just out and not a polished writer. However, the guy coming at you in a dark parking lot ain't no Shakespear either. Despite the current craze of so-called knife fighting experts in the martial arts, don't forget that America has it's own knife fighting culture - prisons. This is not a book on art, it a book on the realities of knife fighting. While it may anger many self-proclaimed ""knife-fighters"", Don is the one with the scars. To tell you the truth I would rather mess with them than Don. Marc Animal MacYoung"
4,A really good book,"That fact that this book is short should not be considered a negative. This book gives you some cold hard facts about knife fighting. The author tells how it's not the knife you have to fear but the MAN with the knife. Great practical advice on awareness and avoidance. Despite what ""other"" reviews say, the author does not talk about how tough or how good he is. Development of mental toughness is highly stressed. Something more ""martial artists"" should try to understand. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Home made,"This product seemed to have been slapped together one rainy afternoon while Mr. Southern was nursing a creative block, with whatever tools were within arms reach.The DVD uses Internet Explorer to view the lessons. Internet Explorer rejects playing lessons with a message that says the DVD poses a threat to the system (XP Home).I don't doubt the author's capabilities with the Zbrush tools, but the execution and production of his tutorial struck me as home made at the kitchen table."
3,Humming Bird feeder,"Purchased this as a gift for someone else to celebrate Spring/Summer time. When it was received the recipient contacted me to of course thank me and to let me know that it did not come with a way in which to hang it. Thinking it was simply missing from the original package, she contacted the company and was told, to ""use a piece of string or a ribbon"", it does not come with a hanging device. I was disappointed to think you buy a gift for someone and then make them go to the trouble to figure out how they will need to hang it/ use it...it almost makes it appear like a ""cheap"" gift. The feeder itself is nice, nothing to rave about, but again, it should include something to make it a ""happening thing"" right out of the package."
1,Pato,"I've bought the cable for using it with my notebook (SPDIF out) and my home Theater Receiver YAMAHA. It doesn't fit my receiver optical input, actually is completly different from all others optical cables I have."
1,Possibly the worst surfing video ever made.,"The Seedling by Thomas Campbell is the worst surf video I have ever watched. It was tough just getting through it one time. It has not held up over time. The whole cinematograph was grey and dull, virually unwatchable. There were great longboarders featured, but nothing resembling a semi-close up to see the glide or footwork or anything else for that matter. The soundtrack was so eclectic that it became annoying. No continuity at all. Avoid this dvd at all costs."
1,Poor quality graphics,The 11x17 reprint of the movie poster is nothing more than an enlarged low-res graphic printed on heavy poster stock. Save youself the $19.99 and print an enlarged thumbnail at home.
1,My memory is flawed....BADLY!,"Thought I remembered this fondly from my youth. Seemed like the funniest show ever till I watched it again. Then I thought, nay I cried: Dear lord, what have I DONE? In short, this show is NOT as entertaining as I remember. Also it has the look of one of those $1 DVDs at dollar tree."
3,Animation Looks Great..but boring story,The best looking animation I have ever seen in my life..but the story is complex as hell and really slow. But the fights was pretty impressive!!
3,Like Nintendo Dogs Better,"THe game play is slow. All you do is clean The litterbox. Help neighbors with their pets . Encludes taking pictures, playing with cats. I was disapointed. Don't waste your money."
5,Pretty Earrings,These are very pretty earrings. The chandelier section isn't too delicate where the wearer feels they may bend and break it.The product description is accurate and the gold is a lovely yellow gold.Eve's Addiction had the product to me 7 days from the order date.
4,Captures Even non-Fantasy Readers,"Return of the Queen captured my interest, and I am not a fantasy reader at all. From the independent young queen to the talking cat, who is wonderfully obnoxious, this is a good read. Although there is an ending, there are many possibilities for future stories about the queen and her friends & family. I look forward to a seconed book that picks up where this one ends."
1,Read like fiction,"I had brain surgery and my short-term memory is gone. For Ms. Backer to remember all the things that she says she does is impossible. Anybody who reads this book and thinks they'll have a memory like her's after the operation, I can tell you now, that it will not happen.One thing you will hear often from family and friends when having conversations about events that happened after the surgery is, ""don't you remember"".To recall conversations word for word, it's not going to happen. She remembers to much."
3,About the business,"This book is not a personal biography of Lucy and Desi. It's really about their business, Desilu. It's interesting but not riveting."
5,works as advertised,it works but me a little tight fit and a bit skinny making it feel fragile but it works and see no reason not to buy it its cheap and provides good quality audio
3,You Get What You Buy,"The examples are not great, and the instruction can be confusing at times. The problems are at the end of every section, which is nice if one wants to focus on just one section rather than having to pick through all of them at the end of a chapter."
5,Book Review,I have not had an opportunity to complete the book yet so am unable to provide a review. I generally am reading more than one book at a time so I will be happy to submit a review later after I have read the book.
3,Early effort.,This is one of Previn's early efforts. Easy listening piano jazz interpretations of My Fair Lady and other broadway type tunes. It is a pleasant listening but not up to his later standards.
1,Safety hazard,"I have had this kettle for about a year, and have been very happy with it. However, a couple weeks ago I started having the problem that many other reviewers here have complained about, the on/off switch not staying on. Curious, I opened up the bottom of the kettle, and found the two wires going to the heating element had melted together, causing an intermittent short. I have reported this to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, and I hope that something will be done."
2,"Works, but seems dangerous","Pros:Heats water quickly, easy to clean.Cons:Mine doesn't always turn off when the water boils. It will sometimes sit on the counter heating the water to the point that it causes the kettle to shake around. I wouldn't feel confident turning it on and walking away for 10 minutes. As it boils, steam can escape from the hinge at the back of the lid. I've burned myself twice because of this. I was hoping it would be a single piece all-metal container, but there's a plastic connector to the water meter on the back."
2,Awkward lid,I purchased this kettle based on the reviews I read from amazon and was disappointed to find out no one mentioned how awkward the lid was. You cannot pour water from the kettle without opening the lid or else water will leak from the sides. This means the steam from the kettle will burn your hand. I am returning this kettle and forking over some extra money for a Russell Hobbs that has been tried and tested by me. Its a little bit pricey but my last Russell Hobbs lasted me 10 years.
3,A few quirks,"I've had this hotpot for at least 5 years. The chrome and black is attractive and it heats water very quickly. However, I have 2 problems with it:1) When you try to pour, instead of coming out in a manageable stream, the water pours in the middle and dribbles on each side, creating a mess. I think it is caused by the interaction of the lid and the spout. I get around it by popping open the lid slightly before I pour, and that does the trick.2) The auto-off feature stopped working reliably about a year ago. It will boil dry if I don't keep an eye on it. It still works sometimes, but when it does it will be at a full boil for a good 30 seconds before it shuts off."
4,walter...,"walter never ceases to amaze me. he is truly a master craftsman...and as usual, goes unnoticed. no matter how many times i listen to the song 'susan' tears appear. and 'let's go get some drugs'...well, its probably one of the best driving around songs ever created."
5,Kept me up all night,"I absolutely loved this book and the series overall. The friendship that develops between Adam and Peregrine is wonderful without being over the top. I particular enjoyed the lack of pages worth of details. I don't care about the color of the leaves, etc. I myuch prefer the dialog between the characters and this series fit that requirement for me.While there is some mention of girlfriends and wives I was glad that I was subjected to ongoing drama from the usual emotional female. Likewise it was great not to have to deal with an unrealistic, half dressed, woman on horseback weilding a sword that weighs more than her. The main characters through the 4th book are men and we don't get subjected to female hysteria until the 5th book.A wonderful modern day story about adepts that takes you all over Scotland with a group of handsome, courageous gentlemen who happen to wealthy as well."
4,Great but geting older,"I like it. Many things was unclear for me, since I used to run Linux. With help from this book I started to understand FreeBSD more deeply and I am expert now, I think.However, Greg must think about some update."
4,An Excellent Referance For The Intermediate User,"I found the book to be a great source of info for differances between FreeBSD and other UNIX flavours. For the new user the info can be a little daunting as I think the author assumes a certain amount of basic knoledge. The only improvements I could think of would be a little more info on very basic commands and also some info on window managers (KDE, Gnome etc). Overall a good book."
5,I love this book,Any Latina trying to make some sence of our cultures should read this book. It is trully a bible to live by.
3,okay meat slicer,"it worked well but wish the manual would have told what number is what.cause i wanted it chipped or shaved.and meat keep sliding out of slicer.but it is better than the ones i bought at walmart,lowes.meijers.but thats my only complaint."
1,Lousy reproduction of a good movie,I think that my title says it all. I expected to see a relatively clear movie and it is cloudy and dark.
3,Bring back Storming Heaven,"I enjoyed this book, but Kyle Mills' other books have been better. I hope to heaven that something like this could never happen and that may have been what kept me from enjoying this more. If someone told you you would like Kyle Mills read them in order. Start with Rising Phoenix and then Storming Heaven, those are both a lot of fun to read, I read this because I like the author, and wanted to stick with him. I'll wait a while before I read the next one."
2,No arsenic test included,"I ordered this test kit specifically because it said it contained a test for arsenic, but when I received it there was no arsenic test in it, though all the other tests appeared to be present. I'm returning this unused, so I can't say if the other tests work or not.The seller was helpful when I called them to straighten this out, so I've given this two stars instead of one, but don't buy this for the arsenic test! (I hope they'll update the listing to accurately reflect the product.)"
2,how do pepole acuatlly like this?,"The answer is simple ALW writes good music, but in writing good music he denies his characters real personaitlies,they have no life only lifeless pepole who sing songs ALW writes no more than concerts so if you like pretty music buy it. if you like theatre stay away!"
5,The Phantom of the Opera,"I went to see the Phantom of the Opera in Las Vegas before it was scheduled to close. I had heard that it was great. I also admire the work of Andrew Lloyd Webber, so I expected the best musical score. I was not disappointed when I received the Original 1986 London Cast CDs. They were in excellent condition and they arrived so soon after I placed the order, that it surprised me. I sent the shipper (barry.mart) an email thanking him for his prompt delivery and for the great condition of the CDs. I cannot stop playing these CDs. The music is in my head almost all of the time."
4,"Fantastic Music, but slight volume issue","I love the Phantom of the Opera. I first saw the movie, and a few years later saw it in London. I believe that the Original London Cast far surpasses the movie cast in terms of vocals. I already had the Highlights of the Phantom of the Opera, but I wanted the whole thing. However, I discovered while playing it in my car's cd player, that it has no volume equilizer. One moment, the volume is turned up all the way, the next I'm bursting my ear drums and it has to be turned back down again. I thought this problem might be resolved when I put it on my ipod, but it is not. That is my only complaint with this soundtrack. The quality of the music is phenomenal. I would still recomend it. (For the record, the highlights did not have this issue)"
1,Oh PLEASE!,"I disagree with those who love this travesty of TPOTO. To quote someone:And unlike some reviewers who think that fans of the book only like gruesome, horror movies, it's simply not true. We would just like to see a version of TPOTO that is closer to the book. That's all. And that goes for any version that has been made... stage or screen... Can't someone make a version that would appeal to those of us who love the book?"
4,Can't Stand Brightman,"I love Phantom with all of my heart and love this recording save one detail: Sarah Brightman. I cannot stand her voice. It gives me a headache listening to her, because she is incredibly operatic ALL THE TIME! While this works well for her cadenza in ""Think of Me"", and she's not too bad in ""Phantom of the Opera"", she ruins IMO ""Point of No Return"" and ""All I Ask of You"". That being said, I think the rest of the cast in amazing, especially Michael Crawford. His voice might sound weird (as my friends say), but he IS The Phantom in every sense of the word. His ""Music of the Night"" floors me everytime. Steve Barton is also incredible as Raoul, and I love him in ""All I Ask of You"". So, basically, it's perfection, save for IMO Brightman. I'd take Emmy Rossum over her any day."
5,I LOVE this version!,"This is my most favorite version. Michael Crawford does a slam dunk with him playing the phantom. Sara Brightman plays a very good part as well. I'm such a huge Colm Wilkinson fan, but this time I feel that Mr. Crawford out sang him in this rendition of the characters. But all in all, I would buy both the Canadian and this version to get a taste of both worlds. It's a win win on both parts. :)"
3,Lots of flaws,"Phantom is one of the most overrated musicals in years. The score is nice at parts, especially the thundering opening, but the lyrics are banal; the characters drone on and on about music, darkness, and love, without seeming to have any real insight into any of the above. The characterizations are weak, and the huge chunk of time they waste on the utterly unnecessary Carlotta is unforgivable. Sarah Brightman sounds like she's in pain while trying to hit some of her high notes. Michael Crawford has a great voice, but he doesn't really come off as menacing; he sounds way too much like Data on Star Trek. The guy playing Raoul is good, though. It's a musical which comes off better in person, watching the huge sets and special effects, than on a recording. I still very much prefer Les Miserables."
5,good,I saw the play in San Fransisco with Lisa Vroman playing Christine. I really enjoyed it. My parents adored it. Does anyone know the name of Lisa Vroman's CD so I can get it for my parents?
4,One of the best adaptions since Disney's The Little Mermaid,"Andrew Lloyd Webber has done a superb job with this, ""The Phantom of the Opera"", with all but one exception; Sara Brightman's voice is a little bit less than exceptional. It's very shrill and nasaly, but it could be remedied if she'd open her mouth and actually sing. I'm not trying to take away from the cd or offend Ms. Brightman because I would reccommend this music to people of all ages if they want to hear a romantic story of a sorrowful soul. Enjoy!"
5,The Phantom of the Opera.....,Great purchase...love the CD...played it a lot already...Can't wait to see the broadway musical of it again hopefully in the new future.
3,One died after a year-and-a-half,"One of the batteries died after a year-and-a-half or so of light use. As such, I would not recommend these batteries."
5,"Good, solid Stevia recipe collection","After all the positive things I had heard about Stevia, I decided to give it a whirl. Coming by good Stevia recipes is quite difficult ... perhaps because many people don't know about it and/or because it doesn't taste exactly like sugar. I have tried several recipes out of this cookbook, and I haven't liked all of them. So why am I giving it 5 stars? Because it beats the competition. Also, I think that if you have never had Stevia before it takes awhile to acquire a taste for it. The recipes that I liked the most were ones that had another ""sweet"" ingredient in it to help dampen the bitterness of the Stevia. For example, I love the Carob Chip Cookies, Carob Brownies, the fruit sauces and the oatmeal banana bread. I did not like the coconut peanut butter cookies or the lemon pudding. If you try a recipe and do not like it, don't give up! Move onto the next one and try again!"
4,Why didn't you keep the same web entry as you had originally,"I really like all of the features of the new 'FIRE' Kendle, as compared to the original Kindle, except, web access was more general and available on the original unit."
1,Wrong Charger,"Sorry I guess I needed the ""second generation"" Kindle charger which I ordered yesterday.The first generation charger did not work on my Kindle."
2,Not happy,"I purchased my Kindle in October and I am all ready having to replace the power adapter. It is very fragile. I love the Kindle, but having to put out $17.00 more for an additional adapter makes me unhappy. Since it is so fragile, it should be less expensive or given to owners of the Kindle for free.P.S. There are none in stock now, so I have to wait.Not Happy"
5,Love,I love Monty Python so this was a must have for me. I laughed a lot and I will continue to enjoy it for many years to come.
3,All clipped up.,"I was disappointed with how much filler was included. It's what aired on A&E (I think) and so it's more of a ""clip-show"" format. Lots of interviews and commentary breaking up what I really wanted to see--the sketches."
2,thin and flimsy,"Nothing wrong with the print quality, but these are far too thin and flimsy to pass off as proper postcards."
3,FOR G VAN,This item did not work very well with my G30 1994 Chevy van only used one part that had to be modified to work could be because this van was a camper van or the single din radio I used was some how different
3,Great but not enought,"Great source, tends to be written for the new user, but still enough hints and secrets for the established piloteer to learn plenty. The EverythingCD, Code Warrior Lite, and IntelliSync software make this the best deal I've seen for the PalmPilot.This book is a must-have for anyone wanting to use their PalmPilot to it's potential... includes hard to find info on multimedia, intro to application development, image and midi capabilities, and non-documented shortcuts."
3,It's a start,"What's wrong with 3rd position? It's not taught here, which I think is odd. 5th position is so much harder, and that's taught, when 3rd isn't.Otherwise, my 6 year old really likes the video. I was hoping she would do it independantly, but she doesn't. I think a formal class would be better."
5,Very good!,"Very good service and quick delivery.I rented this DVD at first to see what it is like.Well...I loved it!!!For the balanced quality of content which is very bright,fun,joyfull and professional at the same time.It is an actual ballet class in a fun but yet in real version.I purchased it as a present for my niece who wants to be a ballerina but doesn`t have a chance to join the studio yet.Besides all of the above DVD has 3 trailers that are fun to watch: ballet,hip-hop and jazz."
3,Little Fast,I bought this for my four year old daughter and thought they went really fast in the program. My daughter has even told me that she doesn't want to watch it anymore because it goes so fast. I think this would be a great DVD if they slowed it down. If your child learns fast and you also have some background in Ballet it may work for you.
5,A book that finally glorifies pregnancy and motherhood,"I find it suprising that this book WASN'T available in many of the local bookstores because they told me it was indecent and filth. However, I finally got a hold of it and I can say without a doubt that this is one of the most upbeat and cheerful book I've ever had the privledge of reading. The pictures ranged from funny to strange - but every one of them appropriate. This is a book I would definately be proud to leave out for others to see..."
5,Finally a book about glorifying the pregnacy of women.,"As a soon to be father. I am especially touch by the subject of this book.I loved the poems, the pictures were amazing.I highly recommend this book to everyone. Yann"
2,"Lots of old, ugly women in tacky outfits","If you're looking for a pictorial celebration of all that is wonderful in pregant women, this is NOT the book for you. The women are no spring chickens, the costumes are garish. Just a big no-no."
2,Building Linux Clusters,"This is my first attempt at building a cluster, so I bought this book. The book has the potential to be a great starter book, but the text is so poorly edited, it makes for a tough read. Another problem, is that nothing in the installation seems to work exactly as it is supposed to. I take one step, debug, fix. Take another step, debug, fix, etc. Not being a Redhat fan (I use slackware), it is very frustrating to try and fix these problems. I am still trying to get my cluster to run, so can't comment on the rest of the book, but after reading the errata on O'Reilly's web site, it appears there are more software problems awaiting me down the road. The reason I bought this book, instead of just reading HOWTO's, FAQ's, website's, etc. was to have a smoother entry in cluster building, but I am not seeing that benefit with this book."
4,over seas cpu,this cpu is an oldie but goodie i took out my socket478 celeron and put in this one and it work's great it just took a long time to get it it was something like 2months but worth the wait price was good to overall good deal.
5,Intel P4 3.4GHz 800MHz 1MB Socket-478,"Sometime ago I had thrown a number of old parts together to build a machine for a 478 celeron cpu I already had. It worked well, but I got curious what the set up would do with a faster P4 and bought a used 3.4 Northgate processor. What a difference it made in boot time, etc. At the time I had a choice between the Northgate and a Prescott 3.4. Researched what I could and bought the Northgate. Recently pulled together another group of old components and decided to try a Prescott just for the fun of trying it out. Haven't put it together yet, but I'm looking forward to trying the two cpus against each other. Cheap to do and what ever happens, no big loss. First machine has been a hoot to play with though."
1,Intel processor,Got it and put it in the computer and it didn't work. Returned it and never got my money back! :(
4,An enjoyable game,"I've purchased this game thinking it the same as the first Mech commander from Microsoft, to my surprize it much improved. The graphics were much better than the first and the terrain is a factor in the game. What I also liked is that you can get new mech on the field without spending anything for them and reconfigure them as you wish. On the negative side the game does slows down when units are in combat. The story was intersting but linear and the AI does get trigger happy but it can be control as long as you keep eye on the units. But for the most part a very fun game to play."
1,Too expensive,"The book arrived on time,but I felt it is too expensive because it is only 53 copies on one side.it means there is only 21 pages on the whole book. I'm not sure the book can help the HOAE in such a few page"
2,Good start,"This book started out very good, although it doesn't explain alot of the widgets and getting data from the widgets very well, for example i had search for around 2 hours for ways to get data from the OptionMenu widget that was not explained at all in the book. The book also lacks good discription for what each function does in the GTK+ reference."
2,Too bad it contains mistakes...,"This book is informative, well designed and, in general, a good book.The only thing I did not like about this book is the errors that it contains and the fact that the publisher doesn't publish a list of errors. Sometimes the explanation says one thing and the code that goes with it says another. (ex: Take a look at page 27 (the code) and take a look at the explanation on page 28. It claims that if eventDelete returns TRUE, the window closes. The code says otherwise)Please put some pressure on the publisher so that he corrects the book in a second printing."
1,OUCH!,"These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the toe, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable."
3,Too Bad,I ordered these because I had been hunting for them for months. I love the look and I knew to order a half size bigger but these shoes are stiff and uncomfortable. I was disappointed in the quality and comfort of the shoes.
2,OK product,"I used the product several times hoping it would be better. Clean up is easy, just throw away the pouch. I tried cooking from frozen and the steak came out tough and the flavor was not very good. I cooked the same meat after defrosting in a skillet and it was very tender. It grills sandwiches alright."
4,Great timesaver.,Have had this grill for quite awhile and still really like it. It's a great timesaver especially if you forget to thaw out your food. It definitely works better with fresh or thawed cuts of meat or poultry but frozen items turn out ok. Wish I had waited awhile to get it because it's quite a bit less expensive now. Still a good purchase and one I've been very happy with.
5,Very Pleased,"Sunbeam 7530 Rocket Grill Electric Grilling ApplianceMy sister told me about the rocket grill and how easy it was to use, so i had to go out and get me one. I love it. Works great and so easy to clean up the mess after you finish grilling. The meat comes out very tender and no grease to contend with. It all goes to the bottom of the parchment paper. I have been telling everyone how great this product is."
1,Grill Plates Won't Come Together,"I received the Rocket Grill 3 weeks ago. I've tried grilling steak and chicken several times, but I have never seen a grill mark (because the grill plates won't come together). Food will eventually cook due to the heat of the grill, but it takes one hour to cook one thawed peice of chicken. I called and complained and they say they will send a replacement. They didn't seem surprised when I told them that the grill plates don't close -as if others have had the same problem. I'm pretty disappointed because I gave away my Foreman Grill as soon as I got this. Maybe the next one will work...."
4,sunbeam rocket grill,"It's fast, quick, convenient and grills vegetables, meat, poultry to perfection. The best part is ""no-cleanup"", just toss the parchment bag away. It cooks with little or no fat and removes excess fat from meats. A very healthy meal results."
2,Dissapointed,"According to the review online, model # 685 would boil the water in a minute or less and it does not. I paid 80. for just a regular teapot, feel as if I was taken by you!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Polly put the kettle on-- super fast!,"I love this kettle. I bought it to save money. I love the retro look of it combined with the modern technology. The lid is tough to remove, so I fill it through the spout. The water heats up almost as fast as it takes to find a cup and saucer! I like the auto shut off-- no more burnt kettles or long-winded whistles!"
1,there IS plastic inside and a terrible smell,I just received this kettle and was dismayed upon unpacking it that it smells very strongly of plastic/rubber AND has a totally useless pole/arm sticking up inside that does nothing but indicate the maximum fill line. I am not going to attempt to remove the arm and thus break it. I have arranged to return it.
1,Heated Water Smells & Tastes Like Hot Metal,"This kettle works really fast, but the water has a very unpleasant taste & smell. I filled it full of water & baking soda and boiled it then cleaned out the inside, this helped a bit but I still can't drink a cup of tea made with water from this kettle."
5,"excellent teapot, fast, efficient","I love this tea pot. It is fast, quick and looks much better than I originally thought. People have said it continues to boil for longer than necessary, but mine shuts off as soon as the water boils. I had a Quisinart that died after two years of use, and a friend recommended this one because he had used it for years.Pulling off the top can be a little hard at first, but now it is easy. There is a small plastic part inside, but you are not supposed to fill it up high enough to touch the part so I was willing to live with it."
3,"Good, but a couple bad messages.","I like the book. But, there are a couple of pages I have to change the wording on. My daughter is 2, so I want to instill good messages in her; she doesn't yet under stand some jokes. For example, one page has an image of Alex sticking her tongue out at broccoli. The words say that Alice cannot eat broccoli because it is poisoned. Another page says that Alice uses fairy dust to turn oatmeal into cake. It is hard enough to try to get my daughter to eat nutritious food without her books working against this also!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"We have given this book to all the little girls in our lives. It is a charming book, that promotes imagination."
1,I wish I didn't buy this book.,"I purchased this book at my daughter's school fundraiser w/o reading it first as I normally do. What a mistake! As soon as I got home and got to the page that says broccoli is poisioned, I wanted to throw the book in the trash. What a horrible message for kids! Yes it is a book about the girl's imagination, but young children may not know how to interpret that. I will NOT read this book to my daughter."
5,Love it!,"I am true 'road warrior'- on and off planes, in and out of rental cars every week. So, I need equipment I can count on to perform and protect the tools I rely upon on the road to do my job. I wanted a professional looking case that would protect and securely hold my Blackberry on my belt and I have found it in this case! It holds it securely (good clip); the flap holds it snuggly but it is easy to lift and remove it when I need to answer a call or view an email. I like the leather stitching as it looks professional when you wear a suit. It was delivered actually early and the picture represented the product exactly. I would not hesitate to order another product from this vendor based on this experience."
3,Not bad,"This unit had very good reviews and following those I purchased the it. It works very well and the only problem I had was with the floating wick. This shuts the console off when the water reaches a low limit not to burn the motor out. Well, not being an expert on these, the plastic wick had a gradual bend and I had to heat and bend it straight. I had to contact customer service and they were very helpful and sent me pics to see how the wick system was supposed to look. On that I am happy with the performance of the system and recommend it. Its quite and dont need to fill so often. The anti-bacterial treatment is not needed and good old scrubbing will clean this well.Tony"
3,Another noisy one but was able to fix it.,"When I turned it on it made an awful racket on both speed settings. I removed the fan blade and determined that the motor was making the noises internally. Rather than deal with a return, and possibly getting one with same or other problems (note other reviews), I disassembled the unit and motor. It is very easy to do on this unit if you are handy with such things (just 11 screws in all). The rotor in the motor was rubbing on the stator frame. I filed off the high spot on the rotor (just look for the scrape marks on the rotor) and reassembled. Now motor noise is in what I would say is the normal range. For a $100 9 gal. humidifier, I like the design, just disappointed with the quality control. 2 stars off for the half hour to fix it."
3,had 2 for years,"I grow orcids, and monitor the humidity with a hygrometer, these units work very well.PROS; digital readout easy to set, wick lasts a whole winter with the use of a bacteriostat on every refillCONS; flimsy wick frame it is easy to break off a retaining clip, the float mount is also very flimsy, on my 2ndunit I used Liquid Nail to add strength to the mount. My local Ace Hardware has wicks for a better price thanthe internet."
4,So far so good.,"We have been using this Essick 821-000 humidifier for about a month now. It has been keeping our 1,400 sq ft home at the proper humidity level so far. We did notice that if the display/setting is set at 50%, it actually keeps our home at around 35-40%. Not a big deal as we have stand alone units that tell the temp/humidity. We only run this unit on low as high is quite loud. I am not sure about filter life or dependability yet."
5,"Safe, quick, and easy esp. for kids and teenagers too!","I use this bagel slicer at work all the time to provide sliced bagels for customers. I no longer have to be concerned about being careless or in too much of a rush and cutting myself with a sharp knife.It saves a lot of time too!Older kids and teenagers can use it and put the parents mind at ease(I am not one to allow my kids to slice their bagels)of them cutting themselves, as well as giving both the parents and kids a sense of independence.Great product!"
5,awesome!!!!,".....no more messy (and dangerous) slicing! This thing works great!!! Just be carful when you go to pick it up because you automatically grab it by the top, or side, and then the bottom falls out. But it really is a great item."
2,Don't expect to learn much from this....,"If you are looking for something to read for the sake of reading, try to find this book used and give it a go, it is a short read and has a few laughs. Do not buy this as a guide on how to start dj-ing at a technical level. All you need to here is: practice, practice, practice, and that is all this book will tell you. Other than that it is a bunch of DJs talking about how they got started, their horror stories and their funny stories. The writing style is quite annoying and some of the DJs just rattle off nonesense with zero value added. A good example of this is a guy (can't recall name) saying how you should start a label and produce music if you want to make it as a DJ. In the next sentance he said he used to have a label and that it was a huge disaster and wouldn't do it again. Hello? Don't waste your time on this."
1,An Inconvienient Truth was version 2.0,"This film proves the green movement was around way before it was declared the new religion of today. Hyper envrio propaganda meant to scare the bejesus out of you - snake oil, global warming, one in the same - Al Gore should have given credit to the makers of this film for creating the formula for this kind of nonsense -- purely spun from one angle. Buyer beware."
1,WHAT HAPPENED????,"I am amazed that this is the same band that made ""is this room getting smaller"". I was really looking forward to hearing this self-titled offering when I heard of it's release. I gave it a good handful of listens, while trying to keep an open mind. After all, I owe it to them after such a stellar previous effort. Unfortunately this record is so terrible in so many ways, I just can't enjoy it. The lyrics are awful, and even the way Jasan sings everything, almost sounds like they are trying to appeal to more of an emo audience. My advice is if you want to sing about morning kisses, and relationships... start a solo project. Don't ruin a good bands name. I am guessing there are alot of dissapointed fans. This is radio-friendly garbage. I can't figure out what these guys were thinking. Jasan, sing like a man. Please! Where is the passion that was present before?"
4,The Island,I liked The Island because it really got funny sometimes in the story. But didn't like it when it got into the nitty-gritty details which kind of made me not feel good. I would recommend this book to a nature. Also I recommend this book to someone who has always wanted a special place to themselves.
4,My opion about this book,"My Reportby JoshThe book I read was called THE ISLAND. I really recomend this book because it's about courage,bravery, and honesty. I think you will like this book because it is a great story. I thought it was kind of boring at first but then I got into it and it started to get a lot better. I bet if you take the time to read it ."
1,It put me to sleep IT really did,[...]It put me to sleep IT really did. I took naps during each chapter It really [...]! don't even think about reading it unless you cant sleep at night! It is about a boy who is weird and likes to spend every second of his life on a stuiped island. there is no point in this book! it is the worst book i've ever read!! it keeps going on and on about nothing he does the same thing every day!! it has no adventure like other gary Paulsen books. We had to read a gary Paulsen book for school they said it is full of adventure NOT this book [...]
3,Excellent book ... for beginners only,"If you have some understanding of finance - even basic - don't expect to learn anything out of this book. I was expecting much more than that given the target audience - ""managers"" - and the publisher. I doubt that in today's world, a manager wouldn't have some sort of understanding of finance. Nonetheless, the book is well written, explained and organized. I had my analyst read it as an introduction and he liked it a lot."
3,Good for couple of years...noisy,"I am tired of replacing these for my whole house attic fan. I recently bought a much cheaper 24 HOUR IN-WALL MECHANICAL TIMER, TORK 711AA 125VAC 1000W 1/3 HP. It works like a charm."
4,Not a bad book,"This book wasn't what I thought it was. Alot of the info in here is common sense and advise, but there is plenty of useful info reguarding free stuff and crafty ideas on how not to waste money on useless things that everyone tells you you need."
5,A Great Compilation,This is a wonderful compilation of great songs from various Sugar Hill artists. They are all winners. It is a joy to listen to again and again. I strongly recommend it.
3,Magnavox MVR450MG 4-Head VCR,"During the first month of use, the VCR broke two tapes during rewind. I needed to retread the tapes and came close to sending it back when, for some reason it stopped ruining tapes. One other intrinsic problem, though, it takes a while to set up to tape a program while watching another."
5,Wonderful if you get the right one....,I actually have the full sized version of this statue and I have to admit that I really do like it. The detail is excellent. The paint is even and the balance is very nice. I rated the durability at one star because the only thing that attached WW to SM is a small metal pin at the bottom of WW boot that is touching SM's chest. It is very tall. I actually had to take one of the glass shelves out of my display case so the statue could stand. I am happy with this purchase but must admit that if I had received the miniature I would have been more than upset.
5,Perfection,"I bought this cd several years ago by accident. I was looking for more of a ""dance aztec drum"" cd, thought maybe this was it, but wasnt. Even though it was not what I was looking for specifically, its just what I wanted. The music is beauiful and carries everything from ceremonial traditional to more upbeat dance. Absolute perfection."
5,AJLI has done it again...excellent job!,Once again Junior League has produced another fabulous cookbook. These cookbooks make such great hostess gifts!
1,I returned this book.,"The information given in this book frequently goes againt the canon of ethics set up by the Association of Author Representatives. It gives a detailed listing, for instance, of ""fees"" that an agent can charge an author. (AAR says that legitimate agents do not charge up-front fees to authors.) In addition, it had a severe paucity of useful information. The chapter on negotiation had only one paragraph on royalties, and it did not even address the issue of royalties being charged on retail price versus net receipts--something imperative for an agent to discuss and negotiate."
3,Tasty but Crumbly,"This cereal tastes great. Unfortunately, it doesn't stand up to the shipping very well. A disproportionate amount of every box I ordered was just shredded crumbs. I've bought this cereal in the store and this was not an issue. It could just be my careless delivery people, but I stopped this subscription."
2,Don't waste your money,Really poor piece of work - they were trying to be fancy with images and music but fail miserably -
2,The fitment is not exactly as Milwaukee states,"I purchased this for my 18 volt Li-Ion cordless drill. I did my homework on Milwaukee's website before ordering. This case is listed as fitting not only the new 28v Li-Ion but the 18v as well. Unfortunately the fit is less than perfect. The drill w/battery will go in and will stay secure with the lid closed, however, the way the drill nests is just not quite right.If you are a perfectionist, avoid this case. If you are looking for protection and easy transport for drill, 2 batteries and the charger, do a little work, make them fit and go.This case may work perfectly for the new 28v rig."
5,Reading This Book Is Now On My List Of Life-Changing Events,"Wow. Buy this book, no matter who you are or how you make your living. I actually complained to the cashier at the bookstore about the price of this book, but now I realize this book is worth it's price x $1,000 and surely more, over time. A quarter of the way through the book I felt my perspective on all of my current relationships start to change dramatically, and while I was reading the book, I had to take down notes of all the new ideas I was getting about how to relate to my friends, family and acquaintances. Less than 24 hours after finishing the book, I am relating to people in a very different way, and noticing how much more warm they are toward me in return. Talk about results. Buy this book."
4,Great for kids!,My 22 mo. old son is a toe-head-blonde with flyaway hair and colics everywhere and this stuff tamed his hair. And it's not greasy like some products. We like it and paid the same amount at our local kids salon ($10). I would recomend this product!
3,dated but cute,Anything concerning Bill Gates is bound to be controversial (and the reviews below support that statement)Take the book for what it is . . . simply a spoof on Gates with some interesting book design . . . it wasn't intended to be great literature!
1,Junk,"God, what a complete waste of trees! I mean, I'm not a billg fan, but this was an completely predictable, utterly sophomoric effort."
1,JUST PLAIN SILLY!,"I regret having purchased this movie but maybe by writing this review, I can prevent anyone else from making the same mistake. I watch a lot of movies and horror movies are among my favorites. Thus, I was hoping that this one would be a good one that I had never seen before. Instead, it was just plain silly. It was not scary and the storyline made no sense. Mind you most horror movies are not viewed primarily for their plots but some reasoning or story line is expected. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
3,works but for how long?,Essick Air H12-400 3 Does it work: yes. Should you buy it? Maybe. It is hard to imagine how such a product could be designed and manufactured more cheaply. If I get one more than one season out of it I will be surprised. It makes me sad that American manufacturing has been decimated to the point that we have to tolerate so many cheaply made foreign products. With a bigger motor and more substantial construction this product could last many years.
1,Incoming Aircraft,"This thing is a hunk of junk, expensive to operate and sounds like an airplane. It never gets the humidity up above 40% not to mention the electric it sucks & the filters. The filters cost about $40 every 6 WEEKS that is just crazy!My husband and i finally decided to just shut off the airplane blower so we could hear ourselves think!"
1,Don't buy this,"I bought my Essick H12 400 13 months ago (Jan 07). It would not turn on after assembly. They had to send me a new and 'improved' replacement 'float rod' which turns the fan off when water is too low. The replacement part did not work either---an obvious design error, the stick was too heavy for the small piece of styrofoam to float and turn the motor on. I had to reach under the fan and push the rod up after filling. After 13 months the motor started overheating and stopping. I could hold my hand 4"" above the motor and feel the heat. Threw it out. My old Sears humidifier ran for over 10 years---this one barely one."
3,satisfactory,"We live in Colorado, so I needed something bigger, more industrial than a table top design that would really get us some moisture. The finish is ok - plastic. The controls simple to use. The large water tank was mandatory. This fits most of our requirements, however I don't recall seeing one single review that commented on how LOUD the blasted thing is. Definately can not have this unit running at medium or high speed in any living space. The noise aside, it appears to be working quite well at humidifying our entire home.Would I recommend this product? Maybe. Would I buy it again? Probably not if I could find a similar unit with less noise."
4,Nice but a bit loud,I have been using it for a few months and it does what it is supposed to do but it works just a bit too loud to me.
2,Over priced and doesn't work right.,This unit is supposed to shut off when it runs out of water. It doesn't.Filling the reservoir with the hose provided takes forever. Filling port on the top of the bottle prevents using the tub faucet to fill it. So you are stuck with the sink faucet and the small diameter hose.Seems cheap and insubstantial for the price.Does a decent job of humidifying though.
3,"Almost, but not quite.","John Beardsworth is a bit misleading in saying his techniques will reproduce the effects of great artists. In some, he comes close, such as in the Van Gogh sunflowers, but his fauve scene looks more like washed-out watercolor, and the others look like doctored photographs. He is more successful in reproducing the effects of great photographers, such as the darkroom work of Ansel Adams. The best way to use the Fine Art Effects Cookbook is to ignore the results and concentrate on the step-by-step techniques, which he presents superbly, and use those for your own effects."
3,Nice effects but some assembly required,"There are a lot of good ideas provided in this book for some very cool effects. However, please know that many of the effects/settings are very specific to the images they use in the examples. Your results will vary greatly with your own photos so it will take quite a bit of tweaking."
2,flimsy blade compared to others,I ordered this blade for stripping fine work on my English Cocker. I have used other blades and knew what it should be but this one has a very flexable (cheap) metal blade that takes nickes that show in the coat. A firmer metal would seat in the handle better and do the job more cleaning without marking up the coat.
1,Art Deco Disappointment,"What a disappointment for the price! While I am accustomed to Schiffer Books being mostly lacking in scholarship, this one was the worst. About 99% of the examples photographed have no manufacturer listed, and nor does the book list any. Since these are 20th century lamps, I would think that some catalogue or information about the respective companies would be available. Moreover, their prices--where do they come from? Their own gallery? Auction houses? Thin air? They don't state their sources. This book was not helpful unless you want to look at pictures. I'm sorry I bought it."
5,Works wonderfully,"We have had this humidifer running for 6 weeks now and it has no problem keeping our desert home at 42% humidity. It is a bit noisey because I have to keep the fan on high to maintain the 42%, but I don't beleive it is any louder than the Sears unit we've used for years. I love the air pre-filter, it seems to keep the pad cleaner too."
3,You want a really great deck? Not this one!,"There are great decks, and there are simply amazing decks! As most of you are probably wondering ""is this deck useable out of the box?""Short answer: NO. It is too slow, and the cards required to make amazing aren't in the deck. So how do you make this deck amazing? Add it to spellcaster's command. This deck is a premature version of that deck, however, the Eradicator Warlock is simply one of the best cards anyone can come across. Paired with the citadel of endymion, those two cards can destroy everything.Best pair: Skilled dark magician + Citadel of Endymion to special summon dark magician in a single turn! Then summon the warlock to end the duel in literally as short as 2-3 turns!OVERALL: This is a STRUCTURE DECK. It will ADD STRUCTURE to you decks, but will NOT function as a stand alone deck. I recommend Spellcaster's command mixture with this to produce an amazing deck."
4,Wonderful voice teamed with beautiful arrangements,"The music of Frank Patterson opens the heart to discover the pathos and joy of Ireland's history and people. This album is definitely ""Ireland in Song,"" from the haunting and beautifully performed ""Fields of Athenry"" to the easily identifiable ""Irish Lullaby."" There is so much quality Irish music out today, and this album is among my very favorites."
2,average,"I was not a fan of this book. I kept reading just to see what all the rage was about. I'm not sure why people love this book so much. Average plot, somewhat original storyline, and average writing. I'd try other writers in this field for more engaging reading (I highly recommend The Bride Finder & Night Drifter for comparison as to how this type of story should be written)."
1,holy crap,"how could someone listen to this unadulterated pap, let alone give it a rating that could only be higher then a vomit stain on a couch. the only way this is going to get 5 stars, is if we are green lighting it to be used by charmin toilet paper."
5,"Marguerite Henry, Knowledgable horse woman and story teller","I recently ordered another copy of All About Horses by Marguerite Henry because, once again, my copy had disappeared.I am a horsewoman who has taught horsemanship for over forty years. I also write about horses, Secrets of a Lazy Trainer, Horses For Writers, etc. When I need to confirm my facts there are a couple of reliable sources I always check first. Marguerite Henry's All About Horses is one. Her Album of Horses is another book I use frequently.I loved her stories as a kid, Justin Morgan had a Horse, King of the Wind, etc. and I still recommend them to my students as wonderful and accurate stories about horses."
3,will be the last ESQ that I would buy,"Bought this watch for my mom, and I didn't really like it when she puts it on. For the money, I would rather buy a seiko quartz which is a lot better for the money."
5,Hard to beat a KitchenAid appliance,"I purchased 2 Black and Decker blenders from Target and neither lasted more than 2 weeks. They would start to smell hot than shut down for good. The KitchenAid works really well with ice cream drinks. The ice cream doesn't seem to stick to the side like the glass ones, maybe it has more to do with the blades. The base is very heavy. You do need to hold down on the mixer when doing anything thick or heavy, it tends to pop up."
5,The BEST nature encyclopedia for kids!,"After borrowing this book from the library for 4 months straight, I decided to buy it for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift. She lives, eats, breathes animals & nature and has spent hours and hours in this book. The pictures are big and beautiful and the descriptions are very well written, nothing dry and boring here. In fact, while reading this with her, my husband and I have learned so much more than we ever imagined! We have borrowed every conceivable nature book from the library and this one, and several other DK animal encyclopedias, are our hands-down favorites!"
3,"Pretty Good Value, But S&H Costs are Ridiculous","I purchased two of these batteries for my wife's Canon camera. Canon wanted significantly more for their battery, but these are working just fine and at a lower cost.Keep in mind that ""shipping and handling"" (they must use gold-impregnated gloves to handle these, or maybe they use a limo to run them to the post office) adds significantly to the cost of the item. I know it's common practice for sellers on Amazon to do in order to increase sales by pretending that their prices are lower than they really are.Still, it bugs me that they get away with it."
1,Hi-Tech Savings sent power2000 battery instead of Ultralast Battery,"Beware if you think you will be getting Ultralast Battery, could be they will send a different brand. Not a different type but a different brand battery. You don't always get what you pay for. Hi-Tech Savings must have run out of Ultralast Batteries so they sent a Power2000 battery instead. Unable to reach them by phone and no reply from email sent."
2,Works but...,"Cheap is cheap I guess. This battery pack does not work well with my Cannon compact. The power meter never knows the status of the battery (it either works or it does not - no warning), and often the battery creates an error on the camera. This occurs only at start up, and sometimes it looks like a diagnostic other times it is a very different battery low warning then Cannon Batteries provides (black screen with large white letters warning of low battery). The irony is that the warning has always happened right after the battery is charged. I can say that they are cheap, they work, but they are wildly unpredictable."
4,Equivalent Digital Camera Battery Canon NB-1LH,"This equivalent battery for Canon digital cameras is an excellent buy and so far has met my camera requirements for my PowerShot S200. Considering the price is so much cheaper then the original battery made by Canon, I immediately had to give it a try. I purchased this battery from Thememstore for $6.75 plus the shipping costs and i feel it is just as good, maybe better than the original one that came with my camera. So, if you have a Canon digital camera and you need a good reliable replacement battery this is great choice."
2,Doesn't provide rated capacity,"Bought 2. 2 different analyzers showed one with less than 600 mah capacity, one less than 500 mah capacity. However, this is what I have run into buying 6 batteries from different sources this year."
2,Works great with my IXY 500 (Powershot S500),"Great battery to keep my old Canon camera going. I don't believe Canon supplies OEM batteries for these models anymore but this one works great. I've bought newer Canon point and shoot cameras and I still prefer the image quality from this one. This battery will keep it going for a long time. Recommend!Update Jan 2013: I no longer think this battery works well. Ever since I've had it I've noticed a much longer recharge time needed in between flash shots. Almost to the point where it's annoying if you're constantly taking pictures indoors. Therefore I recommend that you try to seek an OEM battery in case yours dies. Canon still sells it (might have to call them though since it's no longer listed on their website), or find one on eBay."
4,Great template/guide for planning projects/businesses,I enjoyed the fresh & light approach of this book. Doesn't bog you down with too many rules and must-do's and lets you bring out your thoughts directly onto paper. I think its especially helpful in the starting stages of a business where you don't yet have the information to build a full business plan but need to organize your thouhts. It is also a great ongoing condensed format for a business plan that can keep your actions/strategies in line.
1,The enclosed CD is to old for my system.,"I a left very disjointed in the lack of direction that I found in this ""guide"". I can get more information and guidance for free off the internet. If you get one of these books, make sure it is a current year and hopefully the content will be inspiring. The 1 star represents my appointment. I didn't ""hate it"", just think it really needs to be much better. I feel like I wasted my $."
2,mixed review...,"good, if your proposals are typically book-sized documents and you want to slim them down to a digestible size.not so good, if your proposals are already just a page or two in length. Better off with ""Guerrilla Marketing for Consultants"", which has very sensible proposal writing tips."
3,caution: runs VERY LARGE,"Ordered this in my normal size--WAY too big; re-ordered a whole size down--still too big. The shoes are beautiful, but the sizing is way off. Also, they seem like they would be hard to balance in as the sole is quite narrow."
5,Get it if you can,"The sound quality on these recordings is top-notch. Of equal importance, a number of the tunes are in true stereo. Probably the single best Duane Eddy CD extant."
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT WRITTEN MORE FOR THE UK","This is a good book with some good recipes/ideas and history/theory of ice cream, but because the author lives in the UK, some things don't apply to those who live in the U.S. There is a definite slant towards the UK. For example there are many supply souces listed for Europe/UK and only a few for the US, also some of the terms used are definitely British.The recipes are often complicated and/or time consuming, more so then any other Ice Cream book, and I do own MORE then a few. But I guess this book was meant for the true ""expert chef"" not an everyday cook like myself with limited time.Overall I am happy with my purchase and this book, but I don't consider this to be the ""Bible"" of Ice Cream books as so many others seem to think. I don't think this book really deserves the high praise that It has gotten, I think ""Ice Cream! : The Whole Scoop by Gail Damerow "" deserves that honor, especially for those with limited time and who live in the U.S."
5,Migrations ... back to where we came from,"This is yet another Duhks album whose music will not leave you alone. Some of the songs are so haunting, you can't help replaying it over and over. In particular, ""Three Fishers"" (giving us a glimps of Tania Elizabeth's quiet but wonderfully lyrical voice) and ""Who Will Take My Place"" (sung with lead singer Jessee Havey's signature power and depth of emotion) leave you needing to hear the songs again and again.Overall, the album is more dominated by great gospel/blues tunes than their first two albums (""Ol' Cook Pot"" stands out as well) but there are still reminders of the band's wild energy (""Down To The River"" and the instrumental tunes).Once again, the Duhks have graced us with another oustanding album."
4,Enjoyable,Just wanted to say that I listen to the Party CD and Pernell Roberts CD all the time. The music is fun and really does make you feel like your at the Ponderosa. It was worth the price for just those 2 cd's and the book that comes with it-great pictures and stories about the actors. Kind of hard to listen to that much of Lorne greene though as I really don't think he had that great of a voice. I wish Pernell Roberts recorded more songs as his deep voice is very enjoyable to listen to.
5,Best sandals I have ever owned,I bought a pair of these sandals while n vacation my sandals I had brought were giving me blisters and we were doing too much walking to not get new sandals. I now wear only these sandals. they are well worth the money
5,Dog loves these shoes too!,"I bought these shoes will on vacation...LOVED THEM!! Got home and my dog loved them too! I am on my third pair and have finally learned to put them away, my dog has also enjoyed 2 pairs of these shoes. If they weren't so comfortable I would have bought some other shoe."
1,does not hold up,I purchased these because my sister went on and on about Sanuk sandles. I purchased these for my recent trip to the beach. I wore them two times and only about 2 hours each time and the soles were pealing off under my feet. Amazon was good about leting me return them.
5,the most comfy sandal I have ever worn,this is a must buy. esp if you wear sandals most of the time... very comfy.
5,Good for yoga,I like these sandals because I don't slip as much as when I am barefoot.(Maybe more sanitary in the place that I go to).
3,4 for comfort -1 for stink,"They were very comfortable after the first few wearings. (took awhile for the straps to get stretched out enough for me) I like the squishy softness under my feet. I wear them to work 4 of 5 days each week AND on weekends AND tend to wear them around the house more than any other flop I own. Which is maybe why they are beginning to stink. I've washed them off many times and sprayed them with Lysol, but that only helps for an hour or so. I'm going to try freezing them for 24 hours to kill the odor causing bacteria.. hopefully that will do the trick. I wish the surface had a non-porous coating like the cheap flip-flops from Old Navy or an anti-bacterial ingredient (like Crocs) to help prevent foot odor."
2,Just ok.,"I wanted to love these flip flops, based upon all of the great reviews I read. I honestly don't think they are all that great. My Havaianas are much more comfortable, so I will be sticking with those."
5,Walking on air!!!!,"I am typically not a ""flip-flop"" fan but this one takes the cake!!!!! The cushion the Sanuk yoga mat flip flop provides is unbelievable. It simultaneously is able to form fit to your foot AND spring back after wearing for ultimate cushion later! Amazing footwear!"
5,Great sandal bought @ Amazon.com,"Love this sandal,very comfrontable and easy care. found what I was looking for on Amazon.com. Very stylish also and many colors to choose from. Very promt shipping and fast, reasonable price. Would recommend to a friend."
5,Captivating Images,"I'm not the typical sci-fi reader, but once I picked up ""Daydreaming"" I couldn't put it down. The picturescapes on one page led me to the next; they evoked a sense of the familiar and the fantastic simultaneously. I wasn't as interested in the technical side of their creation. It was the inspiration, the depth, detail and coloring which took my breath away.Slawek Wojtowicz is an artistic force to be reckoned with. I look forward to his future work, both in writing and computer imagery."
2,good while it worked---but poor reliability,"This is a big humidifier for adding moisture to several rooms or an entire house. My house is ~1800 sq feet and gets very dry in the winter. This humidifier did a nice job of adding a lot of moisture to the house before it died. Within the first year, the motor stopped working, and I had to send the entire motor unit in for repair. Then it died again---same problem with the motor failing. Very frustrating, and now I have a large piece of useless plastic. I would not recommend Essick/Bemis products because of very poor reliability."
2,Not what I expected,"The toy was a lot smaller then I had thought from looking at the product description. Also, the squeaker inside wore out very quickly. I have a small dog and he enjoyed playing with it, but I doubt I would but a similar item again."
2,This is not an album pout out by Krayzie Bone,"Big Caz put this out to make money, this is lousy, and even though I think Krayzie Bone is the best rapper alive, these are not his best verses, beatz are lousy and some of the songs he is barely in. Look out for Kray on Chammilionaire's new album and Twista's new album both coming out September 18th."
5,Small but a grear solution mixer,"You are a cheap but sound to match your needs,Then think no more,XENYX1002 FX is what you have in yourHome studio.I recommend 100 percent.Carlos art"
4,Katy Smith Yoga Sculpt,It is an excelant DVD for sculpting.I thought it might be a little faster and more fat burning.But for sculpting it is great .Good directions for poses. Does anyone out thtere know a good fat buring yoga dvd? moffatjo@aol.com
3,The Last of the Full Grown Men,"I like Webb's music, but some of these tracks were beyond my preference. Of the 15 or so on here, I felt only two were good enough to keep listening to."
3,I hope I never wind up in Furnace!,"I found Furnace to be a pretty good read. A little slow, but all in all an interesting story that was even a bit scary in some parts, which I thought was pretty cool, seeing as how I can't seem to find any really scary horror novels these days (a hint to all you horror novelists out there)."
5,Loved It,A story that gets you involved like it was happening to you. Josh Spiller is a likable guy ( like Sam Hunt from Trickster). I think this book was great and can't wait for Muriesl Grey s next book out.
4,Exciting new HORROR from a new VOICE,"This is an original piece of horror fiction using a tried and true premise; outsider goes to a small town, uncovers secrets and weird things going on, a race against the ticking clock, etc.Muriel gray does a great in-depth job about this trucker who is carrying an unknown cargo and just writes a great novel. She is a new writer and is one to watch; she has all the tools to scare and frighten.She writes at a break-neck speed and keeps the obstacles coming. The twists and turns are ""realistic"" and she does a credible job at shaping her characters.Definitely a writer to watch!!"
2,Gruesome,This book did not hold my interest. I am a picky reader and I didn't like reading about a truck driver and his buddies. (I can't believe a woman wrote this book!). For people that like the truck driving atmosphere- you may like this book. I thought Trickster was better.
3,Nice chip amp,"The sound that comes out of this unit is not bad. I have not cranked it up passed 1/3 volume, it has been plently loud around that level. The sound quality doesn't destort at that level either. The major down side to this amp is the fact that it doesn't have enough input/out put pairs so splitter may be needed. Also there is no HDMI in/out. I don't really like the controller but I'm using a universal remote now anyways."
3,Good but not great,"It only has two Optical inputs, but three component inputs. If I turn it down more the 5 or 6 DB in a 10 second span the unit displays the ""OVERLOAD"" message then shuts itself off. The remote is rather marginal as well, no backlighting and buttons that are far to small for my fat fingers.All that said it does what it does pretty well. It sounds good and I've had no problems with setup, sound quality, image quality, etc. It is also the first universal remote I've had that will actually control my DVD player (somewhat). Overall I like it, but without that third optical input it isn't likely to stay around here long..."
2,Shame on You SONY,"Aestically the unit is beautiful. Unfortunately it stops there.The system came without a shred of documentation. No paper, no CD, absolutely nothing. There is no diagram illustrating the connecting points and worse, the included hardware peripherals are not identitied as to use or connection. Their electronic guides did not offer any explanation as to how to use these accessories, and in fact did not even identify them.Multiple calls to Tech Support yielded no assistance and in both instances resulted in hangups after waiting over 20 minutes.This was my 1st SONY and will be my last.!!!!"
1,sony vaio VGC LS 30E,"This product is a piece of trash. My father-in-law bought one for my wife and his 3 other daughters. This computer never worked right from the day we got it. Expensive. It came with virtually no software. Nothing works on it other than e-mail and internet. The tv tuner function worked for about one week and quit. The web cam never worked. Tried multiple times to work with Sony's tech support and they were never able to help solve any of the problems. My son has a masters in computer science and computer engineering. He was unable to get anything to work. He suggested deleting windows and re-installing. Only one problem. They don't give you any disks with the computer, so there is no way to re-install. The other three sister with the same computer all had the same problems. One had the computer keep crashing from day one and was never able to even use it. Overall I have decided I would never buy another Sony product in my life after the nightmare experience with this product!"
3,"Decent, but worth it??","This will give you basics of the game, but it won't really do too much for you. It is nice to have maps, as they'll help you learn the layout of the town better, and there are a few secrets in the game. This book was done well and tells you just about everything you could wanna know about playing the game, but this isn't really that kind of game you need a hint book for. The game is a lot of fun, but it's gonna take practice to get good."
3,I probably think its worth it,You know crazy taxi is a great game but whats the point have a strategy guide anyways because on the game there is an arrow on top and it tells you where to go so im going to have it 3 stars because it can give you good driving skills.
5,Great band!,"I was recently introduced to Carbon Leaf and made this album my first purchase. Now, I can't stop listening! The songwriting is tight, the vocals are amazing, and the musicianship is wonderful. I've recommended this cd to numerous friends. If you are interested in hearing five talented guys on their way up, get this one now ... and then come back for some of their earlier releases."
5,Great CD,This is a great album. The War was in Color was my favorite. It is beautiful and yet haunting. One of the few CDs I can say that I enjoy every song.
3,Needs to be larger,"Okay in an emergency, but of no use when trying to read an entire page. Maybe I should have figured that out on my own before purchasing. Great idea and advertising was in no way misleading. Just wish they'd make one considerably larger."
5,Homeschool Mom,"I have been looking for a way to make teaching vocaulary fun and this is definitely it! My three boys have been watching these short DVD's for only 2 days and even my 8 year old is already using many words in the proper context! The quality of the DVDs is obviously ""low-budget"", but this actually makes it more fun to watch. With only a few minutes a day, you can improve your vocabulary gradually and effortlessly. Start young and you won't have to cram for the SAT in high school!"
1,Funny.,"I used this brand before while trying to get pregnant, I tested with this brand for 1 week 3 times a day and had gotton ALL CLEAR POSITIVES! But the sad part is, I made hubby take this pregnancy test and he gotton a Clear positive as well!So either we are both pregnant or the test is not very good.After I had gotton the positives I went to the doctor for a blood test, came back negative, this product is NOT reliable and you should search for a better brand OR go to the doctor."
2,an encyclopedia is not always a good idea,"somewhat confusing since the author gives equal weight to old, not very often used words and more comtemporay terms. Although erudite at most times, the author has the disturbing habit of getting into very personal insights, which may or may not coincide with the reader. A case in point, he spends almost a full page ranting about the now defunct soviet system of psychiatic treatment, something odd and misplaced in this book.Anyway the author is a psychologist,not a psychiatrist, and it shows."
1,Poor photos and printing,"I am extremely disappointed in the photographs. They are not large enough and not clear enough to really see detail being discussed. With the state of art of photography and printing, the quality of the book is inexcusable, especially since having photos of the various grades is the `niche' the book is trying to fill. I realize that using glossy paper would make this book significantly more expensive, but they could have done a much better job with the existing paper stock. The photos make this book unusable. Instead consider `AMA Grading Standards' or `Guide to Coin Grading and Counterfeit Detection.'"
1,preaching hate and spreading racism,"this book is absolutely offensive on every level, the fact this is even given consideration of being used in the classroom cries out for an indepth investigation into the agenda of these so called academic institutes. This book was assigned for a class, upon reading this trash i began to feel isolated and offended that such claims that ""whites can only be racist"" or that ""whites need re-education"" were common themes through out this book. This absolute JOKE of an educated author , seems to follow the idea that creating a larger divide between people will some how end racism, or even lead to anything constructive at all. If you are assigned this book, contest it before wasting your hard earned money on supporting this type of hate filled garbage. i also support the notion to SAVE UR MONEY... the author should be ashamed, and it only gets one star because amazon doesn't let you put it in the negatives."
4,A wonderful product,"This is a fantastic product. It is simply an olive oil that has this wonderful fragrance of real olive oil, a perfume to which I've become addicted to. The oil goes on smoothly, it is heavier than a serum but smooths your skin in weeks. I don't know if it will fare well for wrinkles, but the texture and complection of my skin has indeed improved. This is a much needed elixir for my tired skin. I would highly recommend it as a natural alternative to day creams."
5,Wonderful moisturizer.,"When I bought this moisturizer I was expecting a lotion but instead I received oil as moisturizer, I've never used oil for moisturizer before, I found out is a very good product, nice moisturizer, it doesn't seat on your skin, it absorbs quick enough, and blends so good with any sunscreen I have used with it, contrary with any others moisturizers I've been used on the past, which they will come out in small rolls when I rub the sunscreen on top of it leaving a horrible mess all over my face is just a nightmare especially on morning time when the time is so limited. I will buy it again, love it love it, I will recommend it especially to people with dry to normal skin."
5,Feels Like a Good Treatment,"Love this - it does feel a bit greasy, but also totally nourishing. It's not just a moisturizer, it's like a moisture serum. The mild citrus smell is really nice. I suffer from dry patches on my face sometimes and after two days of this, they're totally gone."
3,Better for a student than a well-read adult.,"I was told this product had over 200,000 words. When I got it, I found out that meant 80,000 definitions...the rest of the word-count was in the thesaurus, etc. There's a big difference between an 80,000-word dictionary and a 200,000-word dictionary! Information about the product needs to differentiate between ""words"" and defined words!"
1,not worth the money,"I suppose if you had never planned any kind of event, this book might be helpful. Once you've planned even a kids' birthday party, this book becomes obsolete. The lists are ridiculous; the same information and ""hints"" are reworded throughout the book to appear ""new"". For example, there's a monthly list of tasks to accomplish in a year-long planning scenario, and then the same tasks are redistributed and reworded for the shorter scenario; it fills up the book, but one would have to be brain-dead not to be able to condense the year-long format into a shorter list. All in all, it was a waste of money and a waste of time."
4,Great but can't match the original,"Fma brotherhood is truly a great anime but it still cannot compare with the original anime, true the fights are better and the animation is nicer but looks can only go so far. No other anime including this one can match the intense drama, perfect pacing and mind-blowing storytelling of the original fullmetal alchemist, fma brotherhood is once of the best animes I've ever seen and it doesn't even come close because it ruins too many scenes with lame Japanese humor that doesn't translate well. I hate to say that the Americanized animes are the best, but this is true. Buy the original series on DVD before you consider this product, it is a better value not just in terms of money, but is a substantially better productFullmetal Alchemist: Season One Box Set"
3,"Useful, but way out of date...","I bought this book for a recent business trip to Qatar, and was dissapointed to find quite a number of things that were very out of date. The phone system has been updated since publishing, and now all numbers are 7 instead of 6 digits. you can fix most by adding a 4 at the beginning of most listed numbers, or a 5 for cell phones. Also, some crucial info, like the address to the US Embassy, was wrong. The Embassy moved several years ago. I found most of the societal and historical info to be very handy in preparing for the trip, however, so it was worth it for that."
4,excellent value,My 3.5 year old received this dvd for Christmas after he has watched Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Frankenstein multiple times. Having both titles on one dvd is great!
5,Alvin and the chipmonks,"This video was a good escape from some of the seriousmaterials that I usually view.It was funny and Iwould venture to say that the artistic direction of blending cartoons with realpeople was masterful. The movie is somthing that the entire family can enjoy, though it was a bit predictable."
5,Great movie!,Wonderfully uplifting story despite unusual subject matter. A must see. Sub-titles were not an impediment to enjoying this movie. Highly recommended.
5,"great!! japanese humor,that is gear to the west.",love this movie.alot of orginal japanese humor and unexpected laughs.The music is wounderful .enjoyed it some bought the cd.funny and touching.
4,"Great movie, meager specials","I love this movie. It's incredibly moving in a subdued way.The dvd is decent. The picture and sound quality are good, no glitches to complain about. However, the specials section has just one single item: an interview with the director where he talks about the themes in the film. Oh, and trailers, if you can count that as a ""special"".I wish they would make a Blu-ray version for the U.S. Or even a Japanese version will do. There is a U.K. version, but sadly that's in PAL format."
5,A truly amazing movie.,"This really is an amazing movie -- Hollywood could learn a lot from Departures. A solid, emotional story that needs no special effects or CGI. Japan probably isn't the first country you think of when thinking about a movie full of emotion, but this may change your mind and make you want to explore similar movies. It's also a great movie for seeing everyday, non-tourist Japan if you've never been there. The soundtrack is amazing, and you can't help but love the ending of this movie. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
1,Mislead,DeeVeeDee ought to be banned from your site for misleading customers. This BD does not play in BD players sold in the US market. Why not state that clearly? I presume the size of the UK vs. the US markets have some bearing in their practice. Please be careful if you want to purchase this product because DeeVeeDee does not assume any responsabilities.
1,Spirit Centered Relationships,"There is no bibliography in this book; it is an opinion of a couple married for 20 something years and their experience. If I want someones experience, Ill ask them .It seems anyone can publish a book. I would never recommend this. My therapist even panned it. One star is an over rating. It wasn't helpful advice at all."
4,Not bad,"Pretty comfy (as far as pads go), fits well, and doesn't restrict motion too much.Over all, I guess I can't complain."
4,Even Better...,"Evermind is even better than the first two Amethystium releases, 'odonata' and 'aphelion,' both of which are favorites of mine - this offering is significantly less cloyingly sweet than the others. But like the editorial reviewer for Amazon, I want the music to go just a bit further beyond into a even edgier place; I agree going in this direction would really make the music something truly remarkable in a collection instead of your standard cool ambient grooves. 'Shadowlands' from this album is a perfect example of where I hope Amethystium will journey next. I look forward to the next release, but am quite happy with this one."
4,relaxing and electronic music in excelent balance,"This is and excelent album, with a perfect combination of relaxing and soft electronic music.Iwill buy the others albums of this artist."
1,Trying another product.,"I bought this last April and used it yesterday for the first time to blind bake a crust for the T'day feast. I should have lined the crust with parchment but didn't think of it until afterwards. The chain stuck to the crust and I had to scrupulously wash each ball on the chain. I then rinsed it and dried it thoroughly with a terry cloth towel, as per instructions, and set it on a paper plate to air dry overnight before putting it away. When I got up this morning there were rust spots on the plate. I will find another pie weight. It is also not long enough to work without thoroughly pricking the crust."
5,Red TV,My kitchen is mostly totally red and this fits right in. I get so many questions about where I got it. It's perfect.
4,Great easy to change filter to go with a great air purifier.,"Part of the reason we went with theSurround Air XJ-3800 Intelli-Pro Air Purifieris because the filters are so much cheaper than many other models (that and the purifier picks up just about everything - pollen, pollution, smoke, dust, allergens, germs...).This filter is large and heavy duty. The purifier alerted us the filter needed changing (the light went on) after about one year of use. It's super easy to change and only takes a minute. Don't forget to check your manual and reset the ""filter light"" after you do it.We also regularly (every two to three months) clean the outside filter (which never needs replacing) by cleaning it off as instructed in the manual and it seems to keep everything working well and the air continuously clean."
3,NOT FOR NANO,"i recently bought this item and it fits my nano but it is not secure and i am constantly readjusting it... if that does not bother you, then it is a great product but it's annoying when driving"
4,Important chronicle.,"I really do not understand how someone gave this one star! It is one of the important Hip Hop books chronicling the violence in Hip Hop from a mid 1990's perspective, and written from the inside looking out. Any serious student of Hip hop should own this."
1,A waste of time,"The author knows that NWA started gangsta rap and not much else. After a promising, well-written introduction, the rest of the book is sheer disappointment. Ro writes about his sexual exploits, his alcoholism, his brother's suicide, and his crush on a young Japanese girl. In short, everything except gangsta rap. The introduction was well worth reading twice, but not worth special oredering this poor attempt at attacking the subject."
1,It Makes Fudge Too Difficult,I have made fudge with my mom and on my own for years. I wanted to try some different recipes so I purchased this book. Fudge is not this difficult to make and it can still look and taste delicious without all the steps the author suggest. Go with Who Wants Candy if you want a fun and easy book filled with recipes and a common sense approach to making fudge.
5,Roc Project Brings adult lyrics to life,"Starting with ""Never,"" a song that brings home an honest vow to never look back and cut all strings the Roc project delivers real songs. The rest of the songs are amazingly upbeat with real lyrics that anyone with a heart could relate to.One of my other favorites is Blessing in Disguise which starts off slow but with Tina's velvet voice it takes you into an introspective love tune that will have you singing and feeling kinda speacial.My next favorite is twelve steps, which at first I thought was a love song then after listening, really listening, this song could be about drugs, sex, love, designer bags, anything you've ever been hooked on. The rest of the songs are just simply great and fun. It feels good to buy a CD and finally get your money's worth of good songs!!!!!"
4,Rcbs Bullet Puller,"This product was exactly what I ordered. It has good quality and should last 20 years,and was received within 2 days after order. All positive feedback on this purchase."
3,SOMEBODY SAW SAW,"ARE YOU SCARED is one of the many films heavily influenced by the success of ---you guessed it--SAW. Unfortunately, AYS isn't as polished or inventive as the SAW franchise.The simplistic plot finds six strangers kidnapped and forced to participate in a reality show called ARE YOU SCARED. Forced to face their deepest fears, the group is given bizarre tasks to perform or they will die. Sound familiar?The acting is unremarkable and the movie's lighting is annoying. The inclusion of the two detectives adds little to the plot, although the twist near the end does explain the madman's motive.ARE YOU SCARED certainly isn't classic material but is an adequate diversion for hardcore horror fans."
3,Good but short-lived,"Bought one of these 3/08 and loved it at first. Smooth comfortable shave and charge lasted for 5 or more shaves. I use it wet most of the time with shaving cream, as I have found this makes blades last longer. In less than 6 months, however, the shave was getting uncomfortable and the charge lasting for only 1-2 shaves. A new set of blades and foil costs over $40, compared to $55 for a whole new shaver. This is a lot to pay for less than 6 months of shaving -- about $10 per month! UPDATE: Panasonic later replaced the entire shaver when I wrote to them about this experience. They won me back as a customer."
4,For the true Haggard Fan,"This box set is a must have for the true Haggard and country music fan. Nashville has long turned it's collective back on Haggard - and he seems to have reciprocated. Unfortunately this has left a void in young people's appreciation of what has come before the Toby Keiths and Trace Adkins' of the world. This set gives not only a great insight into who Merle Haggard is, but also into the evolution of some of the many classics he's written and recorded. We get several inside glimpses into the recording process of the classics through the outtakes that are included here. Untamed Hawk shows you why Haggard will always be a legend in country music and why he's one of the ""First Name"" club members of country music along with Hank, Johnny and Lefty. The only drawback is that this is a Bear Family collection and as such the artist receives precious little, if any, of the money you pay out for it."
3,Don't buy this one; buy Down Every Road,"Down Every Road is a four cd collection of Haggard's music from 1962-1994, thus it is a much more comprehensive collection of Haggard's greatest work. Buy Down Every Road; its fantastic."
5,common sense,How does an organization become a superior customer service entity? How does one maintain that level of service? Poisant's book is the blueprint..and it is so simple. He reminds us that common sense is all that is required.
5,Dolphin loving Daughter,"Got this for my Daughter for Christmas. I don't know a lot about Beanie Buddies, I thought it was going to be smaller and was pleasantly surprised that it was larger then I was expecting. My Daughter who is 8 soon to be 9 loves it. Its soft and cute."
3,"not 100% cotton, but money cheerfully refunded","This is an follow-up to a previous review on this product as purchased from BH MedWear. After posting a review stating that the product (labcoat) was not 100% cottonas advertised, I was contacted by BH MedWear to apologize for the typographical error.I was told to keep the labcoat and that they would refund my money in full. Indeed, within a few weeks I was reimbursed as promised. They owned up totheir mistake and made things right. Very admirable."
3,channel 1 bad,Good router but the 1st channel locked everything on my network up. The other 3 channels worked fine for me.
2,terrible game........no save option available,"i am a HUGE fan of the Terminator series, and i saw The Terminator for SNES for about $5.00 and bought it.honestly, the game stinks.the game play itself isn't bad and compares solidly to Contra 3, but there is absoultely no SAVE option. NOTHING.no matter how far you get, you have to start all over again."
4,A FUN SIDE-SCROLLING SHOOTER 8 OUT OF 10,"Like Aladdin, this is one of the few licensed products that turned out good before the time of Goldeneye 007 for N64. This game in some ways reminds me of Contra III for SNES, another fun side-scrolling shooter. Since, if you really like movies you should know The Terminator's storyline, so I'm not going to explain it. This game has some good replay value to it, but it does need some work to be perfect and more awesome. The enemies you kill in the game mostly consist of the machines and thugs on the street when you travel time to 1984. So it basically works the same as the movie. If you like Contra, you'll like The Terminator as well because it manages to accomplish a lot for a licensed product, especially for that time period in which so many licensed products sucked to the greatest extent possible. So bravo to Mindscape and Capcom for creating some of the first good licensed products which were actually a lot of fun."
5,Pentius Cabin Filter,"This is kind of a no brainer. I have used Fram cabin filters that cost a bit more, but I am sure these are of similiar quality. What makes these an easy decision is their low cost. You can probably find instruction son how to replace the filter on You Tube for your specific make and model of car. I believe brand isn't important; keeping a clean filter is what counts. Save the money and learn how to do it yourself. When you see how easy it is, you will agree that dealers and auto service centers overcharge. I purchased with Prime. No tax, no shipping, delivered to your door. Loved the experience."
3,Good ino if you can get by the errors.,"There was some good info in this book but it is filled with errors. Someone just starting out may not notice these errors and make incorrect choices on the test. Did not like the format of the answers at end of chapters, lots of trues and falses, fill in the blanks and some multiple choice. This does not really help a person to study when the test is multiple choice. They did have exercises to get you using the real product and that was helpful. All and all I felt it was just average. I say, get Transcenders and the resource kit."
4,Thumbs up -- no major complains,Probably the best of the four Sybex core exam study guides. Well-written and thorough enough to prepare you for the exam. You'll see much of this material reproduced again & again in the Server and SITE books -- learn it the first time and you'll be able to skim through hundreds of pages in the remaining volumes.
3,Not up to the mark,"Since there are not many books available as a study guide for 70-73 Workstation exam. I rate this book as better than others. However, this book does not cover every aspects in detail especially in planning, troubleshooting, and performance issues. I still think it is a good buy but you got have another resources for solid preparation if you dont have 3 years experience with previous versions of NT. If you have read and passed the server 4.0 (70-67) exam then this book appears redundant in many aspects. The authors should have made the differences between server and the workstation very clear and should have elaborated the workstation side of troubleshooting, monitoring, and connectivity issues"
5,Most delicious tea ever!,"Two Leaves and a Bud produces the most wonderful organic teas and this Assam Breakfast tea is lovely, strong and dark - perfect for a nice, big cup of tea anytime of day! If you like dark tea, you will like this one! And the bulk purchase is a really great deal!"
3,Not Strong Enough With Cream and Sugar,"I think I need to look for an Irish Breakfast tea because this is not dark/strong enough for me. By the time I add sweetener and cream I dont get the same taste I am looking for. What I would like to see ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" come out with is a:Decaf Irish Breakfast TeaBut on its own with no cream just a little sweetener it is ok, but nothing to write home about."
4,Very Helpful,"Even though this book was published a few years ago, chemistry never changes. I appreciate the way Paula tells you why a product is not good, for instance, a certain ingredient shouldn't be used in leave-in products, that chemical dries the hair, etc. Her non-biased approach cuts through the hype to the cold facts. I love it!By the way, I've read most of the book, and haven't seen her harping on Pantene. In fact, I thought she was quite critical of some of their products."
3,Too much flailing,"I feel dumb but I didn't know that this workout video is basically just kick-boxing on crack. I'm not crazy about kick-boxing exercise videos (it's funner with a bag) so I sent it back. But if you like kick-boxing videos, this is probably the best one out there. It's just not my thing- the movements are so frenetic, I didn't feel like I was really doing anything but bouncing around a ton. The toning work out is great, the band that comes with the package is a good band, and the accompanying literature is motivating and had good nutritional advice. Chalene is a pretty good instructor, her timing is mostly on. The music isn't great, but not as horrible as it could be. All-in-all it's a fine workout program, just not the kind of movement I like."
5,TurboFire,"I bought this program so I'd have to something else to look forward to once I finish the program I'm doing now. Just for fun, I did the first DVD in the series. I had to pause a few times to make sure I had the moves right. The DVD was fast-paced, fun, and I was dripping with sweat when it was over. Looking forward to doing the rest of this program."
2,Ok but too much turbo hype,"This set is an ok set but the moves are very difficult to follow and I found myself getting bored very quickly. Although you do receive a fair amount of workout CD's and you will sweat, they pretty much all consist of the same repetitive moves and music. I would like to see more variation. 15 - 20 minutes into the workouts and I am waiting for it to get over with. I would like to see more body scuplting work incorported into the routines to provide true definition. The set comes with a 5-day inferno plan promising you will lose up to 10 pounds and 10 inches in the 5 days. I followed the plan EXACTLY and lost one pound :( :( :( A little too much hype that it does not quite live up to what it promises. There are several work out programs out there that cost considerably less and provide routines that are easier to follow; greater variation and body scuplting moves which are essential for a toned looking body. This just doesn't quite do it."
5,Amazing Workout Program,"I ordered TurboFire after only reading a few reviews on Beachbody. It was expensive and I wanted to see if I could get it on Amazon. I found a ""used"" set and was a little concerned that it would be damaged, however, it was in perfect condition and in 1 month I am already seeing amazing results!"
2,Data Cable,Kind of sucks when the software isn't included with the cable and you have to hunt for days to find anything close to the software that supposedly goes with it... wouldn't recommend to anyone.
3,Maxine Rebaptized,"Maxine has recently been rebaptized in the Mormon Church. She said she studied ""traditional sacramental Christianity and priesthood. But ""when I got to the point of priestly ordination, I pulled back. I moved into recognizing the value and power of a lay priesthood in the body of Christ. My searching was complete. I had my answers."" Quotes from the Salt Lake Tribune, July 21, 2012"
1,The Re-Emerging Mormon Liberal Women Pity-Party,"Poor me, poor me. This book brought back memories of another waste of money, ""Mormon Women Speak"" which made us wade through page after page of intellectual, stylized self-pity, written by articulate ""liberal"" Mormon women, who choose to view themselves as the trodden-down. The trouble is, reading their narrative gets old and stale, unless you are of the same mindset as those with the same persecution fantasies."
5,exactly as it says,"Key Holders look and perform just as advertised. I understand the comments that the holder can be wobbly if not mounted correctly but just make sure the screws provided are level and biting into strong drywall or studs. Screw them almost all the way in leaving just enough of the head exposed to fit the metal bracing behind the holder. They look good, serve a valuable function and were relatively cheap. Shipped fast too very happy"
2,Not the type of book you think it is,"I bought this book thinking I'd get some classic Gardner puzzles with thorough explanations but that's not what I got. Instead it has chapter after chapter of boring verse with very few actual puzzles (or even the recreational math it promises). I found a mere 10-12 puzzles in the entire book and you really have to scour the book just to find them. Even the few puzzles that I did find are done in such a poor form that it's just not worth it. I think Gardner just wrote this book so he could finally get that new Mercedes SL 500 he always wanted. Bottom line, he sold out to all his loyal SCIAM fans. Shame on you Martin."
5,Witty and the Perfect Gift Book!,This little book is perfect to give to girlfriends for any occasion! It is filled with fun quotes and quips that will make you laugh - all of us women can relate!
5,Hilarious book!,"This book exceeded my expectations! It is full of fun, smart, and hilarious quotes about being a woman. It's separated into different sections, like love, life, and others. The only thing it lacks is an index or table of contents to tell you which page starts each new section. However, it is perfect for just flipping open and reading a random quote to make you laugh! I gave this as a birthday gift to my best friend and she absolutely loved it! I still have yet to read the entire book, but the quotes I read were fabulous. It's full of even more quotes than I ever expected, with a different quote on each page - sometimes more than one. I highly recommend this book to anyone as a gift, or even just for yourself!"
5,Get Hammered,"This is simply the best religious fiction I've read from anyone in the Lutheran Church. While the author's three novellas were largely written to counter what Giertz perceived as rampant Pietism in the Church of Sweden, they also stand as superbly crafted tales having characters with which one can identify. This is one of the books I try to read at least on an annual basis."
5,Recommended for Annual Reading,"Hammer of God provides valuable insights not only into the formation of pastors, a continuous task, but also for the layperson desiring to live out his or her baptismal life. My only recommendation is that future editions contain brief excursuses on Rosenius, Schartau and other Swedish Lutheran theologians prominent in these three masterful novellas from Pastor Giertz. Does your pastor own a copy? Buy him one for Christmas or for his birthday!"
4,Dixieland Jazz for the Ages.,"Album takes its title from the #10 cut, ""Big Noise from Winnetka"", arguably the best acoustic bass and drum number of all times - and the whistling solo makes you want to join in. This cut is worth the price of admission alone. Some other great foot-stomping instrumentals are also included. Some of the vocals sound a little dated - but ""Oh my, that dixie jazz!"""
1,At least it lasted a couple of weeks,This was the most disappointing product I have purchased through Amazon. The interior of the bowl and the head of the pestle were not coarse enough to grind anything without phenomenal effort and the results were always underwhelming. If that was not bad enough I had the displeasure of having the base of the mortar fractured into many sharp pieces in my hand when trying to grind some seeds. Now I have to find a better mortar and pestle.
4,This is real John Lee Hooker,This caught my attention and I am glad I bought it. It seems like John Lee Hooker uncut at times but still gets me going listening to it. Great songs on it. New songs to me like 'No More Doggin' and 'Odds Against Me' are great old blues songs. The bonus cd has great songs from other artists as well. I recommend this cd for any John Lee Hooker fan who can handle some rough cut sounding songs.
4,Good for what I wanted.,"I bought this text used to teach myself chemistry. I never got to take it in school and always wanted to learn. The book came with the cd-rom but I have yet to use it. It's a good entry level book into chemistry. With a little patience I was able to understand and retain the information. My only complaint is that the math isn't always shown and the steps are not always laid out to ease understanding. The book is cumulative. What you learn in chapter 1, you will need to apply to chapter 2. 1 and 2 apply to chapter 3. By the 15th chapter, the book no longer reminds you of the previous concepts, so at times I had to go back to earlier chapters to he remind myself how they came to certain formula conclusions. Obviously, this would have been more clear with a teacher or professor instructing along with the book. So for a classroom text, I assume there would be no complaints. I think the book is worth the buy and I'll hold on to it."
4,Seven Sinners (1936),"A smart-alec PI and an insurance investigator look into a series of train wrecks and disappearing corpses. Clever dialog, likeable stars."
5,veary good choices,after looking all over i find thease are good prices for the fishing gear in fresh water and salt water
1,Great Book-- too bad you can't read it,"This is an excellent book that has been seriously compromised by a bizarre decision to print it in a very compact way that really leaves almost no ""gutter"" so it is difficult to read the start and end of sentences... I returned the copy as I like to enjoy reading rather than wrestling with a badly bound book. This printing decision is no doubt due to more cost cutting misdirection as our book industry hastens its own demiste."
1,"BEWARE - Cheap, yet, but don't work in many DVD burners",Add the Sony line of DVD Burners to the list that these disc's do not work in... I have a 25pack that is boat anchor and worthless to me! Not one disc is recognized by Sony drives. Will have to go back to Fuji... Memorex has apparently made a huge mistake and ruining their reputation buy going on the cheap for manufacturers.
5,GREAT DEAL!!!,I didn't really play the game I bought it for this female I was kickin it with. She really loved it. Said the game played good and that it was a HUGE dream for her to have the game. Came within 3 days in the mail. I would refer anyone to this guy. Reliable products. If I come across him again I would defiantly by from him again.
5,Excellent and detailed info.,"This book is a great supplement for bodybuilders and just fitness-minded people alike. If you're a technician in the gym or just want to know exactly what you're doing when you're doing it, this is a great resource. Highly recommended."
5,Fanstic book,great book for learning the anatomy of the body and for those interested in body building.
5,Classic Debut,"Jayo felony's debut album, Take a Ride slams and satisfies from start to finish. He is raw and rugged throughout. The beats here are hard core G-Funk, with vicious and rapid fiery flows. Songs like ""I'mma Keep Bangin,"" ""They Got Me On Medication,"" ""The Loc is On His Own,"" show cases his hard, but unique persona. He put San Diego on the map, and shows no mercy!"
5,Great Buy,I bought these sneakers for my 12 year old son and he just loves them. He says that they are cool and comfortable. He says that they are just as good as Nike Air. He has two pairs. He is telling all his friends about them and they like them too. I do plan on buying him more in different color and style. These are very strong quality sneakers and the price is right.
2,"Brave attempt to be fresh, but dreadful disappointment","I'm conflicted about a two star rating as the director and excellent cast make a brave attempt to be fresh and exciting.However if rating this from a viewer perspective, it was a big disappointment and barely watchable.Visual noise, literalism and simplistic read miss much of the impact of the material.It may work well for high school kids needing to cover the material but who don't want to read it.If you are familiar with the play or generally like Shakespeare it may miss the mark for you too."
3,banana,This would have been a great play rather than a movie. They actors recited their lines in play like precision. I expected more special effects from a movie like this.
4,Great reimagining of a classic,"Helen Mirren shines as a female reincarnation of Prospero, one of Shakespeare's most compelling heroes. Her supporting cast is strong, and the unusual soundtrack and lush settings bring this magical tale to life in a weird, mystical way that I think Shakespeare would have greatly appreciated. I especially liked the use of Shakespeare's original songs throughout the movie and how the end credit song was the play's word-for-word epilogue. My only real complaint was the complete nudity on Ariel's part - even in his androgynous form, it was a little too gratuitous."
4,Hard to take,"This writer is excellent at describing the atmosphere these kids lived in. He's so good that I despised the seven murderers, yet I could feel sorry for things that had happened to them in their pasts. I wondered why the defense attorneys, all of their clients being tried separately, didn't use a bully defense. They focused on the poor little white kids alienated in society defense, even though Florida doesn't allow dimished capacity as a defense in capital murder. In reality, jurors can still be reached by feeling sorry for the defendants. The story made me feel sorry that all of the kids had access to drugs and steroids. It's too bad that the dealers are able to keep pushing that stuff."
1,This book is 90% fiction ...,"To anyone wanting to buy this book for the ""true Crime"" value , please don't. Other then the shortly described misery Bobby Kent put people through the rest is made up scenerios and untrue accounts. I have had the chance to get to know several people involved and all agree on one thing , the book is full of it.If this was a fiction book it would be great . If you have already read this book and would like to know the truth or ask questions there is a Yahoo group that may help .http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freemartypuccio/"
4,Page turner.,I couldn't put it down. It is frightening to think there are so many people out there with so little regard for human life and can go from never having participated in such violence to unbelievable calousness and cruelty.The only thing that prevented me from giving the book a five star rating is that for a change I felt it lacked in detailed courtroom drama where I feel most books go overboard. I still would recommend it. I am grateful I have not seen any of the videos as yet. I like to read the book first.
1,Did not receive what I ordered!,"I specifically ordered this light because it is shown with a rechargeable base instead of a cord that plugs into the back. I received a plain old Tykelight with a charging cord. I am very disappointed and now have to deal with shipping this back and hopefully getting this resolved in a timely manner. In the meantime, my kid won't have a nightlight when she goes to Grandma's next week. Aaargh!Do not order this product if you are expecting a light on a base - that is not what you will receive! If I wanted a plain old Tykelight, I would have gone to Target."
2,broke the first time i wore them,Very cute shoes but after walking 15 feet one broke between the rubber and the wood under the toes... super glued it and the other one broke. now i still wear just keep super glue with me. its a shame for the price that they dont stay together.
3,CAD Review,Auto CAD Lt 2008 is a simple 2D CAD system. Works great and is cheaper than buying current edition. 2D CAD has not change much since coming from 2000 version.
4,"Good product, but not what was advertised","This is the second time I have purchased software that turned out not to be the product advertised. This was advertised as AutoCAD LT 2008 and when I received the cd, it was actually the full version of AutoCAD 2008. The same thing was true of a previous 2006 version that I purchased. Somehow verification is needed of the type of software being advertised."
4,Now continues to roll out the great music!!,Another great collection with Now 37. There isn't one bad song in the bunch. I give the CD 5 stars but my CD case came broken so that gets a 1 star. I would think Amazon would do a better job of packaging their CDs. The case was in horrible shape. The CD does seem to be ok but too bad I will have to find another case for Now 37.
4,Now 37 CD,I Have most of the Now CD's---it keeps me up to date on the current music.I liked this one better than some of the other ones---not as many rap songs--I would reccommend it!
4,Lots of good info,"I had never made a pie before reading this book, but I was interested, so I picked up a copy. It has a lot of good recipes and advice for the price, and the sections in the beginning about the different ingredients and their roles in pie fillings and crusts were very helpful. I don't like just following the steps in a recipe. I really like to know what's going on in the bowl/pan, and her details really helped me get a feel for how the process of making a pie should work."
5,Japanese Bookbinding an excellent teaching tool,As a professional artist I found the step by step instructions and black and white photos and drawn illustrations to be exceptional. Each part of the craft of book making including the proper tools and glues for the job are described in easy detail. A variety of Japanese style books are included in this book. A valuable addition to the library of a paper craftsman.
2,technical problems,"after purchasing the first season of the bionic woman and being very satisfied with it, i was really shocked at the poor quality of the second season, especially with disk four. not ten minutes into the episode deadly ringer, the audio goes so low you can barely hear it. it also happens on the episode doomsday is tomorrow. although it only lasts for just a few minutes, four at the most.you would think that the people at universal studios would check out their product before they massed marketed it all over. what were these people thinking, anyway? maybe they weren't."
4,Has this happed to you?,Love the fist season. When i try the 2nd season in my dvd player it states wrong region. Has any one had this happen?
2,CAN WORK...BUT BE PREPARED,"When assembling this product I had a problem with the cheap soft metal screws stripping out before I got the screw all the way in. I had to buy better screws with a pointed tip (the item comes with blunt ended screws made of soft metal). I was going to mount three of these on my garage wall to store shoes for our family, but the idiots who designed it didn't put the hooks 32 inches apart (so you could anchor both ends into wall studs) but the length of the unit is about 23 inches...therefore you can anchor one strip into the stud but you would need to use dry wall anchors in the other strip. The units are pretty heavy then add shoes and I think it would be a wall disaster waiting to happen. They are working well stacked on top of one another. Also, there is no back to these units, so when you push your shoes in, you end up pushing the dividers in a couple inches as well, since the dividers are not attached but just slide into the cube."
3,Just okay,For this much money I thought it would have a back to it. I wear a womans size 8 - 8 1/2 shoe and some of my heavier shoes don't fit in it. Very flimsy. The inside shelves move in and out so I may glue it down. I do like the color but all in all I thought it would be heavy duty/nicer quality. Rubermaid is usually overpriced.
1,Not that fun ...,"This game really isn't that fun. I tried it after reading all the reviews on Amazon, and it seemed like it would be a great game -- but really ... it's not. All you do is fight someone and then you get to the next level. There's nothing that fancy. If you just stand next to them and keep hitting the 'A' button on your DS, they'll die in a few seconds and then you just go to the next stage. Pretttty boring."
1,Preaching to the choir,"This book is preaching to the choir that is singing out of tune. Marxism is a failed political system e.g. Stalin and the gulags. And a failed economic system. When Kruschev came to America in the 1960's and pounded his shoe at the UN and said we will bury you, his wife went to an American grocery store and broke down in tears. Regan's ""star war"" brought down the Soviets by showing them they didn't stand a chance. They finally decided to put their money on a different horse.Unfortunately for us these academic philosopher-kings can't stifel their social engineering projects.""Professor"" Wood has a way with words. Too bad he has not much useful to pop-off about."
4,Worked fine for me,"The display isn't the most visible thing in the world, but otherwise it's worked out OK. It's not the most intuitive interface, but there are really no problems with it. Although it's not built like a tank, it is constructed in a reasonable way for this type of appliance (I need it to heat up food, not save my life in a car crash). The ""beep"" is a little annoying, but not anything to really complain about. All in all, it's a good product that could have been designed with a little more user focus. It heats my food up real well and that's all I care about."
1,"JC penny brand ""cooks"" same oven","This product got one star because I could not go lower! I purchased this product from JC Penny under their brand name ""cooks"". They oven has no redeeming quality or any quality at all for that matter. It is one of the worst pieces of Chinese Garbage I have ever bought! The ""stainless steel the is mentioned in the other reviews here is paper thin. This oven gets so hot I would surprised if this Paper thin, almost foil like covering does not melt! IT is a fire hazard.. poorly engineered poorly made.. The door does not even seal tightly there is between a 1/16 to 1/8 inch gap in the door due to the cheap refrigerator magnet that holds the door closed. This Oven is garbage at any price be wary of chain stores like JC penny selling under their own brand or line.. selling this same piece of Chinese trash. IT is sold there ascooks Digital Convection Oven w/ Rotisserie take a look an do not buy!"
4,Love Actually goes to Spain,"This is a charming film filled with attractive actors and good acting; clever and funny, but poignant story lines. This film one-ups ""Love Actually"" in that it includes a story line involving a gay couple. Watch it ""with someone you love"" (if possible)"
5,loved it,it is a place were all these people are supposed to meet but they all get there at the wrong times and meet others and see what happens from there
1,"WARNING: COMPILATION, NOT A NEW STAR TREK NOVEL","This is NOT a new Star Trek novel: it is merely a compilation of three previously released ST novels, ST II: The Wrath of Khan, ST III: The Search for Spock, and ST IV: The Voyage Home. My one star rating reflects my annoyance at having to return what I thought was a new novel when I purchased it. The rating is not a commentary on any of the novels included in this compilation, which I thought were quite good for novelizations."
3,Boricua Author,Good information to ponder for Puerto Rican studies but not sufficientlygrabbing. Needed to go more indepth with some of the excellent minds thatare in this work.
4,Agree but Disagree,"I agree that it is valuable to a child to have individual books to ""snuggle up"" and read but this book allows a child not to miss out on classics or soon to be classics because they are all there together. I advise for you to still purchase some of these stories individually but when traveling what parent doesn't say ""chose one or two books to pack and that's it""? Now you can suggest for them to bring this book and there won't be any complaints. What's wrong with spending extra money on BOOKS? Also it is a good resource for children's ministry and a good gift for lovers of children's books. My sister used this as a resource of books to purchase for a children's book center and I used it as a gift for my sister who is a children's book lover............."
5,Very happy with this book,"I really enjoy this book. As a future teacher and mother, I know I will utilize the various stories within. Some I've grown up with myself and hold near to my heart, while others are new. If you're looking for a nice addition to any library, I would recommend this book. It's great to have for kids because it does include some many stories and there is a good variety of story lines."
5,Precisely what parents are looking for in a bed time book.,"We have purchased alot of books over the years but this one has a collection of stories which hold my five year old's attention. The selection, graphics, layout and text are perfect for the parent that reads to a child or children. The pictures a well done and colorful. The print is just right. This is in the top two of the ""collection"" of story books we have. I highly recommend this text."
5,One of the best children's book ever,I have given this book as a gift either at baby showers or baby's first birthday. It's all of the stories that their dad and mom enjoyed.
2,Shipment Not Padded,"I forgot to include in my previous post, that we bought an expensive text book and it was shipped in a think plastic envelop with no padding and the corners were munched on the book. Not cool!"
3,A Superb ettiquitte manual,"This book does indeed give the reeder a close look at the society and ettiquitte of this period. Since I was researching the Regency when I purchased it I was a little disapointed to find that it's focus is primarily the latter part of the nineteenth century (1830-1890), and is based primarily on American publications of ettiquitte manuals. I was delighted to discover a wealth of information about everything from dance steps to party preperation to elaborate flirting rituals that can be caried out with parasols and gloves. It certainly says everything Emily Post might have at that time as well as providing a vivid picture of society in a bygone era. A must have for anyone enamored of the Victorian era and usefull still though slightly less relavent for Regency fanatics."
1,About My Refund You Guys Owe Me,Hi This Is Linda Lee Im Very Dispointed About I Never Recieved My Refund On One Of The Bun and Thigh Roller. I was Wanting The Phone Number That I Can Contacted About This.Thank You
1,"Pieces, pieces everywhere","This was a Christmas gift for my two boys. I had actually purchased something slightly different and returned it because I thought that this would have the benenfit of using all of our matchbox cars with something that can shoot the cars and race them. I was rewarded with about 1000 small pieces that clumsily went together to form cheap car ramps that don't stay together (so we get the fun of trying to figure them out each time we take them out). The most fun in this is the bank ramp, which has never been a good vs. evil issue but more of fun crashing a wall. Of the whole thing, the boys had the most fun putting the stickers on.So, I would suggest with your $30, take yourself to lunch, buy a sticker book and maybe take the time you would have taken trying to assemble the choking hazard parts building a block wall with your kids that they can knock down with cars. NOT a good product from Hot Wheels!"
5,sleeve fit,"This has been what I have been looking for. They fit great,easy to get on and off. And they otherwise work as advtised."
1,It's just sugar and a little pack of yeast,You can get it alot cheaper than this at the grocery store. You can actually double the sugar amount required in the instructions and get twice the time out of it.
2,Not a CO2 refill pack,"Advertised as a refill pack- sold elsewhere as a pack of three. However, this item includes only one CO2 refill."
3,Good info,"A lot of good theoretical and practical info with drawings and pictures in a concise, outline format, but somehow chaotic and without the flow. Some diagnostic criteria outdated a little since it was printed in 2002. Newer edition would be strongly desired. Overall, useful for review or just to look something up. Good advise: Have covers laminated before you start using the book, to ensure they last longer than few months..."
5,Great,Great vest for running and good adjustable weights that feel high quality. Helps with vo2 levels to improve performance for most sports. Be careful to run with proper form or injuries will occur with extra weight!
1,Terrible Bench,"This teak bench looks real good, but it stops there. The teak is coated in some supposedly water resistent coating. Within in a just a few weeks of use the coating started to chip off. The water then got under the chipped area and the wood started to turn black (mold?).Don't waste your money. I am now looking for a natural teak stool, one that doesen't have a finish on it."
5,YOU DON'T NEED A DEGREE TO APPRECIATE BOB TIMBERLAKE,"This is an extremely readable book about the popular artist, Bob Timberlake. If you are from North Carolina, you will recognize many of the locations he and Jerry Bledsoe write about. If you are not from NC, you are welcome to ""set a spell"" and watch a boy grow up in a small-town world not unlike Mayberry (yes, there were really towns like that in NC). Surprisingly, Bob was not born with a paintbrush in his hand: this is something he happened into as an adult. Many of the seemingly simple events of his life converged to make him the artist he is today. You will learn what makes Bob Timberlake stand out from the pack and the values that keep him grounded."
4,Some gems in Season 4,"Some fans feel Season 4 wasn't as strong as the first 3-- mainly because Bruce and Cybill weren't together on screen for all 14 episodes...only for 6). Nevertheless, I will be buying S4 because of these gems, just to name a few:*A Trip to the Moon (great ""Honeymooner"" dream sequence)*Father Knows Last (emotional scene with David professing his love for Maddie to her father)*Fetal Attraction (hilarious lamaze scene between David and Bert)*Tracks of My Tears (sexy dream sequence/love scene between Maddie and David, inspired by the movie ""Body Heat"")All of these episodes have interesting behind-the-scenes insight published in the online magazine ""Moonlighting Strangers"". If you really love ""Moonlighting,"" you will want to check out what the cast and crew had to say.[...]"
3,operatic tedium with occasional power and beauty...,"Finally on CD almost 15 years after its Met Opera premiere, The Voyage contains plenty of overwrought operatic tedium, but also some choral passages of surprising power and beauty."
1,A pastiche or a parody of Philip Glass's most tedious music,"Philip Glass's opera is the most tedious one for the listener that he has written since his first, ""Einstein on the Beach."" It lacks the beauty of some of his opera ""Satyagraha,"" though it has the bombast of ""Akhenaten,"" and the eccentric mysticism of ""Einstein on the Beach."" All in all, it seems to be a pastiche or a parody of Philip Glass music, supplied with a text by Henry David Hwang (to Glass's outline) that is as meretricious as Marc Blitzstein's ""Airborne"" Symphony.There is quite a bit of Glass music that I find beautiful and have a high tolerance for repetition, but ""Voyage"" considerably exceeds that tolerance. And with the articulation of the cast in the recording of ""Voyage,"" they might as well be singing in Sanskrit (as in ""Satyagraha"")."
4,Good Way to Get Started with ASP.NET 2.0 - Wish it had more advanced topics,"For those transitioning from ASP.NET 1.x this is a fantastic introduction to learning how things should be done with 2.0. The book is well-written, concise, and easy to absorb the concepts it presents.I've always loved the ""Cookbook"" format, which is to present a list of tasks 100 or so tasks that you might want to accomplish, and then give detailed instructions on how to accomplish each one. The one thing I would like to have seen, and the reason it didn't receive 5 stars, is that the book focuses on introductory tasks. Since I've been working with 2.0 for several months I already knew how to do most of the items they discussed.Overall, this book will serve as a great reference."
4,Strange and lovely,"Have you ever listened to an independent, listener-supported community radio station, late late at night, when they let the freaks have shows? And the freaks always have excellent taste in music and play the most obscure little gems, with seemingly no concept of continuity? So you'll hear a silly pop song followed by an ambient/experimental piece, followed by a country tune? That's what this cd is like: really cool tunes thrown together in a way that's delightfully wrong. This is a great cd to have in the car for when you're driving between urban centers at 3 a.m., and you can't stand listening to talk radio any more."
3,I thought Metallica was supposed to be cool.,"This video was pretty good in terms of reviewing the actual guitar method, but overall was kinda dull. Some of the songs Curt played seemed to be in the wrong note or something, and he put a lot of emphasis on the tablature. Not up to par with what it could have been, but informative nonetheless."
5,Easy to make Dolls House Accessories,This is a great book filled with easy to follow patterns. I would add even more stars if I could. This is a definite must have for all that make miniatures. I also recommend any of her other books you can get your hands on. Keep a lookout for this author!
3,great features but limited life,"I had to work through three of these before I got one that functioned for any period of time. First one quit second time in pool, second one band fell off. Then, after a year, moisture got inside the cover on the third just as I started to like it. I sold it after that. Three was enough."
1,What songs are on the CD?,"I love several of the old GH IV songs: Take My Hand for a While; Big Steel Rails; Get the Urge for Goin'. But don't know whether these are included in the box set. I'd kind of like to know what's included for 130 bucks! Amazon, please provide play list. Thanks"
3,It's worthwhile.,Many people go through life serving the goals/purposes of others and a few pleasures of their own. This book is excellent for those who need a swift kick in the motivator to get it on with their reasons for being here.
4,Early AH Punk!,"This album is a great example of AH's 'punker' sound. It's a little less original than the House and Microstars CDs, but it's still got their aggressive 2-guitar attack (if you like their aggressive stuff, listen to ""Kicking My Head In,"" one of my favorite songs on this album) and Todd's amazing singing style. It's even got ""Jerk Lessons,"" which, at every AH show I've been to, is a big request. In my opinion, definitely get this album before you get Superincredible or even possibly Inverse Reverse Perverse."
2,Not worth much without Eytan Mirsky's title song,"Yeah, most of the music on the CD is pleasant enough, but like some of the other people who reviewed this album said, when I got out of the theater I wanted to hear the rest of Eytan Mirsky's great title track, and it's not on the album! What?! I can't understand this at all. I mean, anyone who wanted Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't that Peculiar"" could have bought it long ago; same with the Coltrane and Dizzy tracks. Someone goofed big time on this!"
3,"What, no title track?","This CD, made up largely of old jazz tunes, and filled out by a couple of selections from Mark Suozzo's score and Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't That Peculiar"" is all right as far as it goes. But how they could put together a soundtrack album and not include the title song sung in the film by Eytan Mirsky is real mystery. I bought the ""Tao of Steve"" soundtrack album last year and Mirsky's two tunes are the highlight of that CD."
4,Works well,"This unti is tough and works well. It is simpler, but more sturdy than others that I have tried. My own has indergone much abuse and still keeps going. I am buying more this year."
5,Perfect for walking in all seasons!!!!,"This workout was much more than i ever expected! The moves are simple enough that you don;t get flustered, but there is enough variety that you don't get bored. I love to walk, but the weather has been so cold this yr, so this is the perfect solution! I do this workout almost everyday. If i am only have time for a quick workout, i can choose 1, 2 or 3 miles... I love this so much it was worth the money! My mom is hooked on it and my friends! If you want to lose weight and have a great walk, buy this!"
4,Moving on up,The video is great for people that is starting out...but the downfall about this video is that once you do it over and over ..your body adjust and it becomes too easy and you will have a stand still in my opinion and you must move on too bigger and better things...but it is good for beginners...
4,AmericaFearIsObedience,Would like to see Charlotte Iserbyt-Thomson write a book on S&B since her father and grandfather were active members..well not so much her father
4,America's Secret Establishment,It is quite revealing ---there are a few wise guys trying to run a huge nation of people with their own ideas. They need wisdom from above to deal honestly with people.
4,black sabbath lullaby,bought for my 2year old grand-daughter. She likes to listen to the music when she goes to sleep.great easy listing music.
3,Tech Ed PRAXIS,This is a helpful book but a little dated and dry. I don't believe there are any other books on this PRAXIS test though so good luck!
5,Ferrari in the Bedroom,This a very funny book. All of Jean Shepherd's books are funny and wonderful reads. It's to bad we have lost him.
5,Four Stories,"An amusing and eccentric collection of stories based on some of society's most controversial issues, addressed within the context of one family's everyday life situations. The main characters: a man, his wife and two children are consistent throughout. Killer Joe, the deathrow inmate in The Felinicide, is a stray cat accused of killing the family cockatoo. Dick is the classic struggle of man against nature. Its namesake is the unprincipled family dog who gets the pooch next door pregnant, creating problems with a difficult neighbor. The Doctress deals with the narrator's insecurity and homophobia as he frets over and endures his first prostrate examination. And finally, Nero deals with a fatal hit-and-run and the media's influence in the investigation on public opinion. The hapless Nero happens to be a big, sloppy dog who belongs to the granddaughter of the popular local news anchor. The trial and eventual resolution of events occur at the family dinner table.--- from book's back cover"
3,Not enough function,"There is no good way to calibrate it.It does not offer records in time. For my needs, I should have chosen a more advanced model."
5,Great Covers Album,"I absolutely love this band. There sound is so unique and great. They have wonderful harmonies and vaguely remind me of Simon and Garfunkle. My favorite songs on this covers album are ""Danny's Song"" and ""The Boxer,"" but all of them are worth a listen."
4,Nice second watch,"Good alternative for a swatch - cheap enough not to make a difference if it gets damaged or lost. Accurate to 30' per month - mine tends to gain. Looks nice and feels solid. Water resistant so, no headaches when taken to the beach or having other unexpected aquatic encounters. No need for battery change until you decide to change the watch all together. Strong clicks for the bezel. The bracelet seems to be the weakest point - looks and feels nice but is in fact poor st steel - it accumulates a ridiculous amount of scratches out of nowhere, much more than any other watch that I worn. Would have favored a rubber band, but for this price and overall good quality of the watch, can not complain too loud...And btw, only the quartz movement is made in Japan, the rest is put toghether elsewhere, but again I don't really give a penny on that as long as it functions well!"
5,A very readable presentation of important documents,"See my review of The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English for a description of the scrolls and of the Essene community that owned them. This volume has an introduction of about forty pages describing the history of the scrolls and explaining how to read them. This is followed by an English translation of 131 0f the hundreds of the ancient Essene documents. Each of the texts has a running commentary, one that interspersed in the text to clarify it and put it into historical context. This is very helpful. It makes the ancient work clear and interesting."
3,"Decent coverage of OSPF design issues, but poor quality","I have to agree with another reviewer - I don't see how anyone can rate this book so highly. True, I haven't yet made it all the way through the book, but already I have many, many errors. Most of the errors that I have seen so far are relatively easy to decipher, but then perhaps there are many more errors that I'm not catching because I'm not knowledgeable enough with OSPF yet.I'm giving the book an avg rating because it does seem to give a good treatment of design issues, but there are just too many mistakes. This book would probably be MUCH better in a second edition."
3,I Should Have Stayed In Bed,I was very satisfied because I received my book very quick and the book was in good shape. I would order again from this company because I trust them.
2,Description incorrect: wrong cable for my car,"This review has nothing to do with the product itself. I would be confident that it will do the job...provided it is the correct cable.The title information for the HA08B says 1998-Up Honda. My daughter installed one in her 2006 Honda Odyssey and it worked perfectly. So unthinkingly, I ordered one for my 2008 Honda Odyssey without first checking the detailed compatibility information. Had I, it would have told me that it was the wrong cable. I was disappointed when I found this out after soldering this harness to my head unit harness, pulled the original radio out and was in the process of installing the new head unit. Installation had to wait a few days for me to get the correct connector.I called Scosche and they told me the correct product for my model/year was a HA10B. When I went back into Amazon and looked at the HA10B product compatibility it did not list my car as compatible. Lesson: before ordering call the manufacturer to be sure."
4,ZATHURA,"If you like board games this is the right book for you: ZATHURA, written by Chris Van Alls burg.This is my favorite book and I hope this is your favorite book too.In the story two boys's, named Danny and Walter, parents are shopping for the day.Then they find an old board game named Jamanji and weird stuff happens.But I'm not telling you what kind of weird stuff happen so you'll just have to read it to find out. It's a good book. Trust me or PERISH!!!!!"
4,"A great, imaginative book for kids!","My 5 year old daughter loves this book, and she enjoys hearing the story over and over. Chris Van Allsburg is an awesome children's book author, some of his other books include, Two Bad Ants, and The Witches' Broom.This is a great buy, and for the price was a hardbound book with a protective sleeve cover."
3,An Interesting Batch of Work from Early UFO Days,"Okay, I have a soft spot in my heart for Incident at Exeter (that's in New Hampshire) because I was born there in 1957, the time period covered here. Fuller's work provides a nice window into the 50-60's era of UFOology, before we were paranoid and weirded out by the X-Files et al. At some times these works may seem naively tame, at others just innocently silly, and I suppose that if you are a True Believer, these should be required reading as among the first works to take a look at UFO sightings through a reasonably legit lens, rather than scribblings from the lunatic fringe."
4,Redundant but interesting nonetheless,"I purchased this book because I knew nothing about the incident at Exeter and because the Barney and Betty Hill case is a ""must know"" for any serious UFO research. I found both texts very redundant, yet informative. If you are doing research I'd recommend getting the book, however, if you just want to know the stories find a cliff notes version and you'll be just as well-informed as those who suffered through the redundant material."
4,A comfortable read,"I noticed a few spelling errors in the book, but other than that I have nothing bad to say about it. The relationship between Christine and Erik is sooo beautiful I wanted to cry on several pages. A comfortable read that is easy to go through, but not in the least bit boring. ^^"
1,Will Never Own A creative Product Again,How bad is bad. Owned this unit about a year and made the BIG mistake of trying to update it. BAD MOVE !!! It is now a paperweight and all Creative wants to do is sell me phone techinical support with no promise of repairing it. I have tried a few of the things on the web to no avail. All it does now is show up as a 20M drive instead of the 40GB its supposed to be and any software that Creative has won't reconize it even thought Windows dose. Will never buy anything from Creative again and will warn everyone I see about them.
2,Dead after 1 year 5 months,"My wife & I bought two of these for Christmas in 2005 and loved them (our first MP3 players). Mine died 5-28-07 (5 mos out of warranty) and Creative's attitude is ""so sorry, too bad, pay us for service, including online support or just fix it yourself."" Read the postings on the Creative forum before you buy ANY of their products - CAVEAT EMPTOR. They have posted a firmware ""upgrade"" that frequently destroys the player. Woe be to the owner who hasn't backed up his ripped files. I have, and am shopping for another player, but it won't be made by Creative, I guarantee. We still own 2 Zen MicroPhotos (8 GB) and her Zen Xtra still works, who knows for how long? BTW, Creative's software is junk; you would be much better served to buy Notmad Explorer."
1,Newest Firmware Upgrade Destroys Player,"It's that simple. The newest firmware upgrade for this player halts mid-install, not completely installing. The player will not start, Windows will recognize the player, but because there is not a complete set of firmware on the player, Creative's own software will not recognize it (thus not allowing me to run another firmware upgrade on the player). Do not buy this product.By the way, I'm not alone with my complaint. The creative forums are plagued with complaints of this."
5,Great player for great value,"Before I purchased a portable jukebox, I did my reasearch in which was the best. I saw the Nomad and the features impressed me and so did the value. I was going for lots of hard drive for little money and the Nomad clearly beats the ipod in that catergory so I got it. I have been very happy with it and can take my whole music collection in my pocket. I haven't had any problems with it and I'd recomend it over the ipod anyday."
4,Very Satisfied !!!,"I had the first generation 20GB Nomad Jukebox for almost two years, then the headphone jack went out. Luckily, I purchased it at BestBuy and had the 2 year product replacement coverage.(I had seen the reviews about this fault and poor customer support from Creative) I instantly, received a voucher for the replacement and got the Zen Xtra 40GB. It has worked fine.The sound, ease of downloads, software, file management system all work good for me. The battery is good also , I usually get 10hrs playing time with a 3 hour charge. The car adapter kit works excellent, my moderate quality car audio system pumps a real nice sound with this model. Generally very satisfied."
3,Cannot use Rhapsody or Yahoo subscription services,"Be careful...this is a great MP3 player for the money but the firmware does not support subscription mp3 services like Rhapsody and Yahoo. They need to provide a new release and it's anybody's guess when they will do it. So, don't plan on using it to download subscription music."
4,Overall great MP3 player,"I bought this to play in my car and listen to while I go on my walks. \I have had it for 5 months now with absolutely no problems. It has frozen up a couple of times, but the reset button takes care of it and does not effect the memory.It has superb sound quality and is very user friendly. I don't think I will ever fit all of my music on it. It transfers songs super fast.My only issue is the size. It is bulky to take on walks or to exercise with. But for the price and the storage capacity, I can't complain too much.I like the creative labs products so much, I am buying a smaller MP3 player (MuVo2 512MB off of eBay stores creative.labs at a great price!!!) for exercising with."
4,"A little big, but other than that, a GREAT buy","It is a little big, but it's worht it when you experience all that it has to offer. It works great, never stalls or freezes. I REALLY love my Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player!!!"
4,Mediocre Guide to a Superb Game,"This game is excellent. Any person that enjoys playing a good rpg is totally welcome to this game. Extended gameplay, character advancement, intricate story line, what was missing? So far I have beaten this game well over 10 times, but everytime it has been the same. Where are the several endings, different story lines, and many different characters? I'm not seeing them."
4,Energized,"This stuff is great! Taken as directed I have a full amount of energy all day long. No problems falling asleep, and no shaking, like other pills loaded with caffeine. Having high blood pressure, I have to be careful as to what I take for energy. This didn't affect my blood pressure at all. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone."
1,Torture,"I have had to read many NFPA books over the years and this particular one evidently attempts to impress the reader with overly worded tedious explanations of very simple concepts you should probably already know if your actually going for management. This book was more boring than watching paint dry. As required reading for promotional purposes I gutted it out anyway and I can not imagine any other reason for anyone reading such an overpriced, overly confident useless book. In my opinion, NFPA books are the most condenscending and patronizing reads imaginable and they should apologize to all affected parties victim."
3,Not well written,"I found this book difficult reading due to the fragmented way subjects were covered. There was no natural flow to the topics presented, so I found myself having to reread often. To me, the examples were weak, often lacking details necessary in making good management decisions, i.e. the purpose of the book. Needless to say, if you don't have to buy it, don't! There has to be better options available that present this material."
1,What a piece of junk,"We ordered this off the gold box deal and when it came it either was refurbished or put together so poorly and with gunk all over it, we returned it. Next one was only marginally better but knowing our cat would love it we kept it. It was quite loud and the pump input was loose and finally came out making it only work when jerry-rigged. Complete waste of money, where has their quality control gone? I would strongly advise someone looking for something like this to look elsewhere."
3,Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow,This item is not the best on the market. You have to fill it everyday and it gets slimy very quickly. It is very hard to take apart to clean. My cats like it though and the metal tongue does seem to keep the water colder.
2,Always dirty and louder than a fish tank.,I imagine my cats are like most in that they prefer fresh water. They prefer it so much they've been drinking out of the toilet. To stop this I tried this product (white) and was disappointed immediately. Within days there were hard water stains and dirt collecting in the corners. This is besides being so loud I could hear it from a room away with the door closed. The 'stream' of water was weak and the pump would clog with hair every couple of days. I ended up having to clean it more often than a simple bowl so it saved me nothing.
3,"lasted several years, great while it lasted","My wife has come to love the easy-set count-down timer feature on just a few Casio watches, and this is a beautiful pink (her favorite color) to boot. After several years of use, though, the translucent band has grown discolored (whether due to sunlight or skin oils, not sure) till it's more of a light orange . . . not so pretty any more. Also, the ""mode"" button has broken off, leaving a metal stem that supported the button) that has to be pushed with a finger nail or pen. Time for a new watch."
5,J&amp;L provide an important source for social &amp; literary inform,"Anne Thackeray Ritchie's journals and letters provide a significant source of social and literary information for mid-Victorian to turn-of-the century historians and literary critics. As the editor and principal force behind Cornhill Magazine, Lady Ritchie knew all writers ""worth knowing,"" and can provide intimate daily life insights into the closed world of British publishing of that era. Her writings are a particularly valuable source for feminist and art historians inasmuch as her drawing room wa"
1,60's Blast Off Not worth it,I ordered the Richard Simmons Disco and Blast Off.The Blast Off is not worth it. Richard does not givecontsistant instructions and he goes too fast. I havehad a lot of Richards excercise programs and this oneis not worth it.The Disco is a lot of fun!!
2,Not easy to follow,"I know Richard Simmons helps a lot of people, but I found this DVD to be difficult to follow. Richard's cuing is practically non-existent. Also, it's difficult to follow the moves when the camera is focusing on someone's face instead of their body. I was very disapointed and plan on giving this away to a relative."
3,OK,"We had high hopes for this pillow, but measured as instructed to get the right size produced the wrong size for my husband. Though his measurements prescribe this size, a much smaller one was better for him. Now this one sits there..."
3,Average,This guide could have used more updated information. In listingthe restaurants in Gros Islet/Rodney Bay some of the restaurantsand clubs were either closed or didn't exist. The other information was accurate like the Sulphur Springs in Soufriereand downtown Castries. also more pictures and detailed maps should have been included. Overall the guide was mediocre during my visit in St. Lucia.
2,Maps Are Lacking,I found the three or four maps included were not detailed very well. I was hoping to be able get better maps so I would know what to expect and how to get around.
2,not up to his high standard,"This one doesn't satisfy like his other cds. I miss the humor, the funk, the electicism found on his other work. This one, while not awful, is just ordianry. Surprising, coming from such a talented dj."
4,This should really be 4.5 stars...,"Daniel Littleton and Elizabeth Mitchel have done it again. As if Ida wasn't good enough, they formed a new band (they being the only two members). The sound is very reminiscent of Ida, but with more drum machines and bjork-ish sounds swirling around in the background. The vocals of Elizabeth Mitchel and the guitar of Daniel Littleton are as incredible as ever, and the songs are just as melodic and bittersweet. If you gave nick drake a drum machine and an acoustic guitar, it just might sound something like this. Mitchel and Littleton are certainly two of the most unique and talented musicians out there today, and this album is just more proof."
3,"Good for jogging your memory, but nothing more","While this book has been incredibly useful in times of writer's block, is it not very thorough, nor in-depth. For instance, under ""Ordinary,"" the author was generous enough to include common (English) names - Mary, Perry, Jerry, and Terry. What about Barry, Sherry, Larry, Carrie, Gary, or Harry? In addition, there are not very many entries, requiring you to mentally try to conjure the name of a rhyming word and look /that/ up. However, the format is decent. It's worth your money, if you don't plan to use it very often."
1,Almost Useless as Kindle eBook,"There is no way to input the word you want and go straight to it, or if there is, I couldn't find it. There is no instruction on how to use this book on the kindle. An ebook of this type (dictionary) must have a way to get straight to the word 'Blue' rather than laboriously going through every page, only to find that you now have to go to 'do' to find the rhymes. The only other way was to take a stab at a location number - painfully slow.If it is too much to hyperlink every word, one of two simple things could alleviate this problem: A page at the front with links to the letter of the alphabet you want. or ""A = location 135"" ""B ="" etc. Not ideal though.To be fair, the book looks really useful, I like it's simplicity, and it's content. I would give the paper copy a 4 star rating, but I have the eBook. I think Amazon needs to separate reviews for Paper books and eBooks."
2,Couldn't get past the first episode,"Anyone who's tempted to watch this because of the mech fights, don't buy it. The action isn't too bad, at least it didn't make me want to smash the dvd. But then the main character started talking again. Her flowery romantic dialogue is horrible! A large portion of the show is listening to her internal monologue where she talks to her imaginary prince or goes into way way way way too much detail describing something. Show, don't tell! Needless to say, I regret buying this. The only reason I didn't give it only one star is that I was only able to force myself through the first episode (and even then, I had to split it up into 3 sittings) and there is a slight possibility that it might get better."
3,It's alright,"It's certainly not one of my favorites, but it wasn't too bad either. I watched the whole series once and that was enough."
2,An 'Eh' anime,"I picked this anime up from my local store. I usually go for Funimation's stuff, seeming as I don't tend to stray from the ones they put out. They usually put out really good anime, but this one. It caught my attention when reading the description. But as I watched it, I became frustrated by lack of character progression and was annoyed by the main character, Kuu."
1,Shady Business,"Not only was this not a 12 pack, but it basically was a single bag of sawdust...not chips.Charged me over $12 shipping & handling, to send it 40 miles from their business...plus it took 10 days from order.Will never recommend buying anything from these folks..."
2,little frog mats,Was very dissapointed to only receive one mat for this price. I felt like for this price and these being much smaller than the large ones I would have gotten 2
3,Have not received these YET....,"I am sure these will be very nice when I receive them, however, this has been the most difficult order to receive that I can remember. The full floormats arrived fine, the seat covers and utility floormats had to be resent as I did not receive them......go figure. Don't know if they were not ever delivered, left at the wrong house, or stolen by our wonderful neighbors.....I might think twice before ordering online again, although you are supposedly making good on these orders."
3,"Cute, But Not A Book I'd Buy - a review of Clocks & More Clocks","We like Pat Hutchin's books, this one included, but it is not one I would buy. Cute though it is, ""Clocks and More Clocks"" is sort of a one trick pony.The whole story is centered on the fact that clocks in different parts of the house don't show the same time. The reason: it takes time to travel from one floor to another. But once you figure out what is going on, how entertaining is the story? Not very.Three Stars. Cute. Makes children think, but it's not a book that I imagine children will ask for over and over. Once you *get* the joke/point, the book looses its luster. Suggest getting at the library."
3,"New ""Keith Douglass"" writer doesn't cut it","I understand that ""Keith Douglass"" is the name used by a number of different authors who write the Seal Team Seven and Carrier series. It seems that there's another new author writing as ""Keith Douglass"" now, and I wish they'd go back to one of the previous ones. The dialogue isn't very smooth in this book, and I thought the way Jaybird resolved his coaching problem was extremely disturbing. I hope this isn't an indication of a new ""loose cannon"" attitude on the part of these Seals. They've always been portrayed as being quite professional."
3,Seal Team 7 Shines again,"Douglass' Seal Team and Carrier books are easy reads. The good guys come out in tope shape again, and again and again. Not much concentration needed in handling these books, but they are fun...especially for retired military p[eople. Will end up reading all of both series'."
5,From An Appalachian Perspective,"Loyal Jones has been a role model to me for many years, and as a West Virginian by birth I value his books as presenting an alternative to the stereotypes the ""flatlanders"" often have about us. Would recommend this to anyone!"
2,Digital sucks,"The first show usually go pretty good but the second one and parts of the other shows breaks up so bad you can' t see it. So I lost most of the shows . 1 - 3 season dvds went really good and I still have to see the 5th season. I will see if they will exchange this one and see if the other one is okay . Otherwise I'm glad I got them. I thought that it may be the player but it did the same on other one also. Also there is movies on both sides of DVDs so watch for that. I just went on amazon and other people must have problems. Trying on blue ray now - so if you don't have blue ray watch out! I will report back if that doesn' t work. Well it did do alittle better but than it couldn't run and stop with just a frozen picture, so I will try to get a different one . The fifth season is so far good."
1,"Are You Listening, Universal? Not One Penny From Me","Don't you realize it yet? LISTEN... the people who buy DVD's of a TV show are FANS of that TV show. People who never watched Quantum Leap are not going to BUY Quantum Leap. The people who DO buy Quantum Leap expect the shows to be intact, just as broadcast. OTHERWISE YOU ARE RIPPING OFF THE FANS, THE PURCHASERS OF YOUR PRODUCT.My collection stopped at Season 1 and you won't get another penny from me if you continue to sell what you refer to as ""complete"" when it is in fact NOT."
4,Another Awesome Season!!!,"Get ready to leap again with Dr. Sam Beckett as he continues to put right that once went wrong, with the help of Al. This season, Sam becomes a hologram, reluctantly joins the KKK, becomes a raped teenage girl, a chimp, help an older woman become a singer, a possible gay cadet at a Naval Academy, flies into the Bermuda Triangle, a soap opera actor who is kidnapped by an obsessed woman who wants to have his baby, leaps into Al at a younger age and much more! I highly recommend QUANTUM LEAP: THE COMPLETE 4TH SEASON!!!"
2,a big disappointment,"A big fan of Puccini, I was anxious to learn something about his life. So, I came to this book with a lot of expectations, but, sad to say, they were disappointed. The book reads like a sequence of factual notes for a biography, rather than as a coherent piece of work itself. The style just awful; run on sentences and other stylistic infelicities abound. An good editor would have/could have helped immensely. And so much of what is included is irrelevant, such as the names of steamships on which various personages traveled back and forth across the Atlantic. And there is really no conclusion of any sort. Puccini dies; Turandot is completed and performed (sevaral pages) and... that's it. And...that's it. I'd recommend it...but warn not to expect too much."
4,judes,Got this for granddaughters snow cone machine.Love the shape of cup so much easier to hold.Straws are great a nice size for scouping so nice I ordered a box of 200.GREAT
5,Just Great!,"What you see it's what you get. A must for bonsai and orticulture entusiasts everywhere. Sift sizes in 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 of inch makes a breeze to prepare mixes from coarse to hose big pots to very fine to the top layer or to those plants that need very sandy, dry mix. 5 star product, if you're in the patio, bonsai or even for curing that great homemade compost you do it's the perfect tool; 100% satisfaction guaranteed."
5,One of the Outstanding Textbooks in Geophysics EVER,"Turcotte and Schubert updated their 1982 edition to account for new developments in geoscience, and the result is the most comprehensive textbook on geophysics for the upper level undergraduate/graduate student. It is an outstanding reference, and is clear and concise in its treatment of a variety of geophysical phenomena. Stress/Strain, Elasticity and Flexure, Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Gravity, Rock Rheology, and Planetology are all treated with detail and provide the student with a tremendous introduction to geophysics. I recommend it to all geologists and geophysicists!"
5,Perfect fit for my tripod.,I have an Ambico tripod and have misplaced the 2 quick release platform that came with it. So glad they still sell this item.
3,Two stories for the price of one,"The first story is about the last of a tribe living on the edge to avoid all strangers so that the three young women(the last hope for the survival of their tribe) will become mates in another tribe. Along the way they find a young boy on the run from blood thirsty hunters of a dark god.To pass the time the old woman Ayina tells the history of their people, the Geh-i-nah, who they are the last of. Their story has just as many hardships as they search for a new land for themselves."
3,Hose was too short - But I made it work,"On my car, for some reason the suction line connection was way down in there. I looked everywhere for a longer hose, but couldn't find one anywhere. So, I bought this cheapo one on Amazon. It was short, but I had to do something so I tried using it. I had to route the hose down the shortest path in order to make it work at all. That route was right down along side the serpentine belt. I had the can of refrigerant down in there too and it was quite awkward. Anyway, when I started it up to add the contents of the can, the hose rubber rubbed on the moving belt and I promptly wore a hole in the new hose! I aborted the job in disgust. Well, I went and bought a one foot piece of gas line hose the right size and a couple of connectors. I snipped of the worn place of the hose and cleaned up the two ends. I put in the extra foot of hose and now I had a hose of sufficient length to reach coming into the connection from a safer location. Worked like a charm!"
4,"Pics, people & history. Very cool.","A beautifully presented book. As the operator of a small vintage saxophone website, I really appreciate the information given.This book is primarily a history from the player's perspective, but it also has some info about the design and manufacture of the horn.Few technical or historical errors that I saw. I've seen that he's really tried to research his material -- he was a regular on a few vintage sax discussion boards.I wish the book were longer and had more information on the horns themselves!"
2,"a dissapointing ""coffee table"" book",Anyone who knows much about the saxophone will not learn anything more from this book....the novice who knows even less about saxophone performance will know even less. The pictures are terrific.
1,Yamaha z9 has been discontinued,"Although the older z7 is still illustrated in Yamaha's web page as well as the latest z11, the z9 is conspicuously absent. The z7 has 140wattx7 whereas the z9 has 170x7 while the z11 reverted to 140x7+50x2. Evidence gathered from other users showed the z9 has heat problems that caused the z9 to auto-shut down unexpectedly. Using his knowledge of heat convection, one professional reviewer had questioned the location of the cooling fins unknowingly predicting an imminent design weakness. Inferring from the evidence, it appears that Yamaha has withdrawn the z9 and replaced it with the proven power supply of the z7 plus the extra 50x2 in the z11. If you still are interested in the z9, do ask the seller about the heat problem and a guarantee bond."
4,Southern rooms book,The book arrived as promised (very quickly) and was in the exact condition as promised! It was great to get it so fast and knotty ow that the gift was ready to wrap!
3,Prep for CSVPN,"Hi guys, I have completed this book. Plan to appear for exam soon. Unable to find any free prep questions online. Do you know of any prep site to practice. Also appreciate some tips for this exam. Your early response is awaited. Thanks - Sarah"
5,Love this DVD!,"Love this DVD from Leslie Sansone! I picked it up at my local library and, after working out with it one time, I decided to buy it! I am waiting for it to arrive any day now. What I love about this DVD is the fact that I get a great workout in a short amount of time! The 2-Mile Brisk Walk is the one I do and it is great for an intermediate/advanced exerciser like me. I am 52 years old and have lost 43 pounds thanks to Leslie Sansone and her wonderful walking programs. I keep adding more and more of her DVDs to my collection - this is my reward for eating healthier and exercising at least 6 days/week! Thank you, Leslie!!!"
5,Walk Away the Pounds,"Had this previously on VHS tape and it finally wore out, so ordered a new one. Walk to this 3 times a week."
1,Eats tapes days after receiving,"Ths things has ate more tapes than the last I bought. Now it only plays the grey fuss when a tape is in, but you can hear the sound"
2,"good tv at first , but not anymore and the company is lousy!","I bought this tv about 2 years ago and it was a good deal...for a while. But just a few days ago, I noticed that the tube's color is off in some places. At first I thought it got hit by lightning, which has happened to me before. But then I called the Emerson people and apparently this is very common w/their tvs! Not only that, but they refuse to do anything about it even though they admit that it's not my fault and why? Because I don't have the original store receipt. I'm sorry but do they really think their customers keep their original store receipts that long? What would do they do if a customer called about a product they've had for 10 years? Not to mention that they don't need such a thing anyway to verify that it is indeed an Emerson product - it says Emerson right on the tv for heaven's sake! I'm pretty disgusted w/this company and I won't be doing business w/them again."
2,Don't bother to pick a winner!,"My three year old grandson is frustrated because the blue car always wins. He is now a happy camper. His younger sister just likes to see the cars run. His comment was, ' what does she know'."
5,Great Buy!,I ordered this for my sons 2nd birthday! He loves it and my husband and himenjoy trying different hot wheels to see which one is the fastest! I even enjoy playing with it! Great toy!
3,"good, but ...","... the fire on the DVD is just a part of the cover picture. I wished to see more of the burning wood as it is on the picture. The real good thing is, it is a real wood fire and there are no zooms etc. Finally, I love itand won't buy another one."
4,A very solid look at our first President,"While I understand the criticisms of this work in the previous reviews written here, I do think that they are somewhat unwarranted. I would like to see more written on the portion of Washington's life covering his two Presidential terms. However, I liked Randall's emphasis on Washington's formative years as he built his estate and grew into a politician, military officer, and a leader. Randall does a good job of balancing Washington's role in the Revolutionary War with the role of so many of his trusted advisers, political opponents, and British Generals. There was so much to Washington's life that to cover all of it in detail would result in a work that would be unreasonably long. If you want to understand what our first President was all about, how he came to lead our country through the Revolutionary War and became our first President, this is an excellent choice."
5,wicked comfortable,One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes i own. durable and comfy... good for dress or casual. highly recommended.
5,"Comfortable, stylish, good value","This slip-on is really comfortable. I have the brown one and it is set to all my casual pants and jeans. The value was excellent too. If you choose the right size, you definitely will enjoy that."
2,The Great Brain,"I read the book The Great Brain. But there were some parts that I did not like. Overall, most of the book was great. If you ever get a chance to read The Great Brain, I think you will like it very much. A.M."
5,Panama - The Canal,"This book is full of a history which I was not aware of and is most informative about the way the United States became the builder of the Panama Canal and of how, in the end, we had to give up this great engineering feat. Moreover, being a novel, it is very fast reading. It moves rapidly and intelligently and is, in my opinion, an easy way to learn history."
4,Good product!,This product took care of fine lines around around my eyes and smoothed my 75 year old skin more than any other cream I have used without causing adult acne break outs.
1,No difference,"I've had it with nonperforming products, hence the many one star reviews I'm about to give. Hopefully it will save someone from spending money on products that do not work...at all. I would give this product more than one star if it actually did something, but it doesn't.I'm turning 40 with fine lines starting to set. Laugh lines now appearing. :( there is no firming whatsoever with this product. It's a bit sticky, but once on the face, it absorbs and is not noticeable at all. I have sensitive skin and have not had a problem at all with breakouts. But, it did nothing. Used approx 5 months. Sorry Philosophy... Fail."
4,"I've been a D & D player since around 1980, so yeah...","Watch the movies with a neutral, open mind. Don't try to compare it to the game too much, just enjoy it for what it is!"
4,I always thought shopping was murder,This is the first of the Susan Henshaw mysteries that I have read. I liked the premise of a murder in an outlet mall. The characters were interesting and the mystery fairly difficult to solve.
5,Definitely a must-have for your WATP collection,"I just did this DVD for the first time after completing miles 1-3 of Leslie's regular Walk Away the Pounds and miles 1-2 of her Express Walk Away the Pounds.So far, I've loved every single one of Leslie's walking workouts and this one is no different. It's high energy, fast-paced, and goes by surprisingly fast for 3 miles!My only gripe is that I wish she did 1/2 mile increments again like she does with the 2 mile express. Sometimes that extra encouragement makes a world of difference.But I still highly recommend it to anyone ready for the 3 mile walk.Kathleen"
5,Leslie Sansone 3 mile walk,"I already had the 4 mile Leslie Sansone Express Walk, and absolutely love the 3 mile walk. Have lost over 50 pounds doing her Walkaerobic DVDs!!!!!"
5,Perfect Prehistoric Projects,"This was our five-year old's favorite Christmas gift. He hasn't stopped playing with it yet. It took some time, but the directions were clear enough that he could build all 8 models without help. A super creative set for a great price!"
5,Lego 4892 Prehistoric animals,"This Lego set provides specialty bricks, joints and two easy to read instruction booklets to build the following 8 prehistoric animals:1. woolly mammoth2. triceratops3. parasarolophus4. tyrannosaurus rex5. stegosaurus6. pteranodon7. velociraptor8. brachiosaurusYou can't build all of them at once with the bricks provided, but if you do mix up your Lego sets as I do you could build more than one model using the instruction booklets. And also to scale up the smaller models. The brick colors are mainly red. The instructions given will provide you ideas to build other animal models. If you are into prehistoric animals and Lego, I would recommend this set."
4,Creator toys for my creative boy,My son does not usually like to play with the things he builds with his Lego sets. He just wants to build them. This is the best way for him to do that. It has directions for 8 different dinosaurs and then picture ideas for several more. What a great idea!
2,Buy only if you think you really need it,"I almost regretted buying this product. When I first received it, I couldn't help but notice how small and awkward it was. I didn't believe it could stand upright if I placed my Zen in it. Well I was right. You can't press a button or scroll without knocking it over. So in order to fix this problem, I bought some double sided foam mounting tape and affixed it to the flat surface. Now I can press a button without it falling over. It doesn't flop around or fall over and it stays exactly where I want it to. So if you buy this, throw some tape in the basket along with it. Whomever designed this and allowed it to be produced for mass distribution was not thinking. The price is outrageous for such a cheaply made device. Well, I'm off to write a good review on the mounting tape and how it can save poorly thought out products."
2,Only fits 30 gb version,"there's a difference in thickness between the 30 gb & 60 gb versions of the vision:M. This only fits the 30 gb, which didn't help my 60gb version. probably a good product, but i'd rather just pick up another key instead."
4,A Little Pricey,"Be warned that this does not come with the power cord and brick to actually plug it into the wall for recharging. The one that came with the Zen will do the job fine, but don't kid yourself that you are getting a whole second set. Seems like a bit too much to charge without coming with all the cables, so that kept me from giving it the whole 5 stars.Other than that warning, it works very nicely just as advertised. To set it up the first time, just plug one cable into a USB slot, and plug the power cord into the wall, then slide the Zen onto the cradle. Synchs up immediately and recharges MUCH faster than just doing it with the USB cable."
3,Not necessary,"I give it three stars because it works, and it probably will be conveinient to some, but for me it just isn't worth the money. I bought it at the same time I bought the zen vision m (they came in the same shipment). But, I also but a flexiskin case for my player too. This caused the player to be too thick to fit into the docking station, therefore, every time I want to dock it, I have to take the case off. That's a total pain, and I don't want to risk scratching my player, so I usually end up just using the charger and cable that came with the player. So, if you don't have your player in a case, this thing will be good for you, but if you've got yours in a case, its a real pain to use."
4,Creative Docking Station,"Overall the product works great. No complaints. However, be aware that this docking station does not come with the video cable or the a/v cable. It does include the usb though. Enjoy."
2,Warning: adds no functionality,"This is just a fancy version of the adapter that already comes with your Creative Zen Vision. Which is fine, but not for this price!If you're buying this to be able to charge your player from a wall outlet, or to play media directly to the TV, this is not what you want. You need the separate AV cord and the separate DC charger. These will work directly with your Zen Vision's standard adapter, without needing this docking station.The only value this docking station adds is giving you an extra adapter, but in stand form. THAT'S IT."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,I am dissapointed with this product. When you try to hook up speakers using the a/v outlet in the back of the docking station the zen vision m shuts down and it does not allow you to use the controls. It will keep playing the current song but it will not allow you to do anything else...What gives?...this product is idiotic...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
2,"Died after 1 1/2 years, but now fixed.","I used to be employed by an electronics retail store. When I got ready to buy a flat panel TV, I really wanted a samsung, but settled for this model because of budget. After a 1 1/2 years of use, I too am having trouble with the backlight. It just goes dark religiously at start up every time. After about 30 minutes of hassle (beating it) it will generally stay on for the rest of the day. Luckily, we bought the extended warranty and Best Buy came out and fixed it. The repair guy said it was just a bad ground issue. Looks like he knew exactly where to go to fix the problem."
5,Comforting read for pet lovers,A friend recommended this book when she lost her pet. The book helped me deal with the death of my much loved 14 year old schnauzer. His sudden passing was extremely upsetting and this book was very comforting. I would highly recommend reading this book to anyone that is dealing with the grief and loss of a pet.
2,Animals and the Afterlife: a shameful exploitation,"Basically a vehicle for psychic hoo-hah. Each of these stories attach their ""credence"" to one spititualistic medium or another or some ""animal communicator"" of whom the story-tellers always say had ""no way of knowing"" that they had lost a pet. Yeah, I believe animals go to Heaven, but I don't believe they're all up there talking to psychics. This book won't leave you with a good feeling unless you buy into people who ""talk to the Other Side""."
1,Not A Book For Recent Loss/Grieving,"the first three or so extremely long chapters are a labored autobiography of sorts, plus item plugs, and is otherwise about pet rats. it takes forever to find anything about another animal type. here and there are interesting paragraphs on animal communicators. when you are grieving, way to much verbiage to wade through.a book suggestion that gets to it and is 98% full of brief stories about pets' souls visiting their friends/owners after passing to let them know they're okay is 'The Soul of Your Pet' by Scott S. Smith. out of print, but findable ... next suggestion would be 'Blessing the Bridge' by Rita M. Reynolds."
2,A clock radio with no alarm,"I bought this specifically to use as a bedside clock radio and, obviously, did not understand from the text or photos that no actual alarm is included. The only ""alarm"" is for the CD or radio to be programmed turn on at a specified time every day. I guess that works to wake some people but not for me. There is also no snooze button or other normal alarm features. The price was excellent and the box is a beautiful retro style but even at this relatively low price I can't believe this device has a clock without a simple alarm feature. If shipping weren't so expensive relative to its cost, I would return it."
3,It's a basic guide but doesn't really tackle the exam issues,"I prepared myself with this book, I read all the book, I did all the tests, I ran the CD Test and I still think is not good enough. I realized that when I comfront myself with a good book called ""MCSE Readiness Review for 70-028 Exam"" that book showed me I was not in good shape for the exam. I Use another book called ""SQL Server 7.0 Administrator's Companion"" I was able to address 80% of the issues for the exam which BTW I happend to passed very well. The exam is very loaded with questions on 3 main areas: Replication, Backup & Recovery and Security. I think the MCDBA book does not address the cases, details of those areas to prepare you for the Exam."
1,Very poor to awful,"This book has lots of errors. It will not help you pass the exam; it may only serve to confuse you. Especially after communicating with the publisher, I've vowed to never buy another Syngress book again.Once I bought the Sybex Study Guide, I really learned my stuff and was able to pass this very difficult exam. Stick with Sybex--you'll really learn from them!"
5,An Outsanding Value,"the only problem I had with the test was the sheer volume of material. If I'd had more time to study I probably wouldn't have failed... cam't blame the book though. Its very thorowgh and written in a straightforward and common-sense style. the cd cause d a some minutes of confusion but once i sorted out, and am using it to test myself for the next try."
2,Stay away from this book,"If you have absolutely no knowledge of the rudiments of SQL Server 7.0, then buy this book. If you want to pass the test, look elsewhere. This book glosses over the exam objectives- certain key objectives are handled with single paragraphs!!!"
4,Simple & Not Intimidating,"This book held my attention from beginning to end. I tried one of the recipes right away because they seemed easy and not overwhelming. I liked the suggestions for dining out and also appreciate the statewide resources (restaurants, markets) listed in the back of the book. The book took away any reservations I had about pursuing a 100% raw diet. She's not as strict as others - i.e., eats raw steaks, tuna, cheese, etc. yet appears to have all the benefits other stricter raw foodies have like youthful appearance, better health & energy. sign me up. put me down."
3,hungry for more,"I did like this book and enjoyed Carol Alt's honesty. However, I wanted more information. The intention of this book is to be a beginners guide to a raw food lifestyle and that is exactly what it is. I finished and was very excited, however I still didn't know how to start and had to go find another book. But I will still recommend it b/c it held my interest and I think Alt has good intentions."
1,"So,So","Was not impressed with this book. Very few recipes and what there was seemed very dissapointing. If you want a book with extensive information try ""Rainbow Green Live-Food Cuisine"" it also has a lot of good recipes. Also ""Raw Food"" by Matthew Kenney and Sarma Melingailis is another really good book. I wouldn't waste my money on this one."
1,"Not the best beginner's book, no way","Alt's was my first raw foods book and got me intrigued with eating raw mostly because I'd not seen anything else on the subject before. It's not by any means the best, however. As other reviewers indicate, this is a sketchy raw foodism guide that's heavy on Alt's personal experiences with a large dose of ""glam."" She does offer encouragement and good suggestions for getting into raw eating. However, other books do that sort of thing far better and in greater, more useful detail. Jennifer Cornbleet's recent Raw Food Made Easy is a much better transitional book with detailed shopping hints, even a list of precisely what and how much produce to buy for a week's worth of using her recipes. Also, Cornbleet's recipes require no fancier equipment than a blender and food processor. Take a glance at Alt's, buy Cornbleet's book."
3,A book about a woman who is stuck on herself...,"Once I got past the first 1/3 of the book it was great however it was excrutiaingly ANNOYING to keep reading over and over again things like *I was once called PLAYBOYS most beautiful model* and *I have been on hundreds of magazine covers* and *I was the first elite super model* I could go on and on. This is a book that is about living raw but only if you are willing to tolerate a woman with the notion that she is actually better than everyone and, yes, we know, the most beautiful elite supermodel beautiful pretty elite beautiful super model...blah blah blah...I found the recipes great and the literature about raw was useful in making the transition.This woman really knows how to honk her own horn. The book is written in conjunction with a friend who wrote part of the book and the simple fact that this woman knows someone who will put up with her incessant back patting is beyond me."
1,I hate to even give it a star,"This book sucks. Did Carol pay to have her friends give good reviews? Hey, lets write a book about ME, ME, ME (and a little on raw foods). Please don't waste your time with this one."
1,lost credibility,"I fail to understand how Alt decided that the raw food diet was perfect and cooked food of any kind is bad. She describes how her diet as a model consisted of a slice of brownie pie a la mode at night, apples and carrots now and then and a minimum of two cups of coffee with scotch. No wonder her body was screwed up! It's not the raw food that straightened her out--it was eating a small meal and balanced every couple of hours that did it. Don't waste your money. Cooked food is not evil (for both meat eaters & vegans). Living on alcohol and sugar is."
5,"Great, gentle product!","This product was highly rated on the Internet as I searched to find a great facial cleansing cloth. I was looking for a SUPER-soft cleansing cloth for my sensitive skin and, after trying many brands in all price ranges, these wet cloths are the BEST. I would definitely recommend it for this reason. However, it removes make-up well but no more than some of the cheaper brands available."
4,Pearl Drumhead,"Quality product, as to be expected by Pearl. I find it sounds better without a hole in it. I also added an Evans EMad batter head that really made my drum sound full and deep."
2,Picture is false advertising,"The picture of TWO bottles gives the impression that you can buy two at this price. This seems intentionally misleading. Read the fine print -- you only get ONE bottle.However, the product is wonderful. It helps my digestion, increases my energy throughout the day, and decreases my appetite in the morning!"
2,This Very Small,A very unique item. My son loves it but it's a poor value. The thing is less than 6 inches.
4,puzzle,It's a nice puzzle! The transportation theme is very useful because you can develop different language skills and fmc........for me it's a great resource
1,Useless 101,Reading this book is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Even Dr. Seuss is more informative. The authors have proved that saying absolutely nothing in 14 chapters is certainly possible.
1,toy helmet,"If you are unconcerned with actual protection and are only buying a helmet for compliance and looks, then this should fit the bill. Not only is the liner thin as hell but the shape of the helmet seems to create an airfoil effect, so that the wind is constantly trying to rip the thing right off your head, so any kind of highway riding is like king kong slapping your head back and forth."
1,look funky smaller people and kids...,"I seldom gave 1 star rating, but this is a must. The helmet's shell is the same for all sizes, they just stuff more foam for smaller size. I bought size small for my son, it look funky on him. he looks like spoof darth vader on the movie space ball. The worst part is the seller did not enclose return label so customer have to send it back at his or her cost. From now on i only buy helmet from dennis kirk or chaparral, they always enclose return label."
2,"Good Idea, Looks Weird","My personal opinion is that it sets up way too high on one's head! Protection is very important, but it seems like it carries too much bulk inside and it sets too high up on the head."
4,Jesse's impossible to find band in between Operation Ivy and Common Rider,"All of the musicians from operation ivy, as I say in my ""So You'd like to"" guide, went on to make different bands. This is the only decent one. Rancid was ok, not great, Bokcar whatever sucked. Transplants where the worst band ever. This was the only band in my opinion that was pretty good. Not as good as Operation Ivy, but still great, Operation Ivy fans, this is a must have for you.I don't think it was as Good as Common Rider, but it is still great.This cd is really rare, and I think that the only place you'll really be able to get it is online.PEACE!(By the way check out my guide about Operation Ivy)"
2,Don't pay for 1 day shipping.,"I will submit another review once I receive the watch, but I must express my displeasure at being told that it shipped with UPS overnight on the afternoon of Sept 22, and then receiving a message that states ""We electronically transmitted your shipment information to the carrier but they have not received"" on the evening of Sept 23. I had taken the day off of work to be there to sign for the package, wasting a vacation day that was worth (some would say) more than the price of the watch itself. My excitment, alas, turns to frustration. They shouldn't report a status of ""Shipped and in Transit"" until the item is in the hands of the shipping company."
4,Epson printer ink,I have been using an Epson 2200 color printer for several years now and this ink does the job. I always stay with the printers suggested and recomended brand. Mixing inks with various printing devices can cause several problems. If you do plan on changing things up then I would suggest doing alot of reading on this subject.
4,no complaints,What is there to say?...it's great ink. I use it in my Epson 2200. My only wish would be the cost being lower. :)Buying this pack saves you a little money...
5,Book Review,Secrets of the Prophetic was a good read. I like this author and am encouraged by his life and how he opens up areas of thought and truth that I have not considered before. I recommend to anyone who wants to grow and learn to listen for God's voice.
4,Amazing Truths,Kim Clement has very humbly decribed his experiences and outlined the very mechanism by which God reveals His thoughts to man. Being part of a prayer & deliverance spiritual warfare team it is very important to hear from God and to follow His voice. The principles given by Kim clearly coincides with what our ministry is involved in doing. They really work!
3,7581 is a better deal,"The Q7581a works the same, but has more toner inside. It has a 50% greater yield, but costs 31% more. If you buy more than one of these per year, go with the high yield version."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,We bought this toner cartridge in Nov. 2010 to keep in inventory. Used it in May 2011. It spews blue ink on every page. Cannot call the company (Calitoner). Their line is always busy. No response to my inquiry to their firm using their online form. The product is not an HP product although they use that image. Do not buy from them.
4,You've gotta love it!,"Love the characters, love the plots. Highly entertaining and thrilling TV-series. The first season is wonderful, the second season ok. Hope they can pull it together for the third, even though they have fired Mandy Patinkin from the lead role. A shame, because he ties the team together wonderfully."
4,All Great stuff but subtitled option would have helped,"Super series. Great initiation into the world of BAU. Complex plots, Apt Characterisation and super acting. Only downer was that I had ordered the DVD set after having read that the DVD has English subtitling which was missing in the set that I finally got. A point less for that but all in all a must see"
3,I'm a big fan of Criminal Minds,"If you want to watch a show that you can't anticipate how the episode will end this show is perfect for you. Very well acted although the second season the actors are a little more settled into their characters and their performances flows with less effort. I am a fan of Thomas Gibson, Matthew Gray Gubler, Shemar Moore and of course Mandy Patinkin. Kirsten Vangness plays an eclectic research expert that is fun to watch. It's a great show - I'm hooked !"
2,"Great Series, but they replaced the music!!!","Criminal Minds as a series is great. Part of that is the great choices in music that was used with each episode.How ever for some reason when the DVD set was created, they swapped out the music used in most of the episodes with poor knock offs of what was originally used on TV.If you just want a good tv series, get this series. If you are a Criminal Minds fan, you will probably annoyed by the music swap."
1,Simon Wesseley is a junk scientist,"I wouldn't trust anything by Simon Wesseley; his anti-scientific biases are too profound. For example, he has done an incredible amount to retard science in ME (aka CFS)."
1,"WARNING, you may get worthless booklet instead of real book.","I was tricked by Indoobestsellers. Indoobestsellers sent me worthless advertising booklett 10-15 pages, the size of the postcard instead of the real book that has about 760 pages of illustrations. Please make sure what you are going to get before you order this title, avoid being taken for a few dollars and waisted time. Booklett I received is just advertisement of the real book and should be send free of charge. I was taken but having sense of humor I have to admitt that billing and delivery was very fast."
1,Not Art,"I expected the book to be explicit so no, I am not a prude. I bought these as risque and out-of-the ordinary gifts for my friends but alas, art, they are not. Repulsive and sophomoric, in the garbage they went."
4,Fit my civic,I bought a cd player along with this is install but the cd player turned out being a dud. So cant really tell you how great this product is without that piece not being there.
3,C. Celata,I received this book as a gift and was so excited as my Dad Joseph Celata played in the Beanpot in 1957 and was named MVP for scoring the winning goal in OT. Boy was I disappointed when I read the section on 1957 - as it talked about a Joe Eclat scoring the winning goal in OT. What a shame!
1,Listening to Lessack's listless voice,"When I saw the list of fine songs on this CD, I got excited, but then I actually played it. Mr. Lessack's delivery is so boring and bland that I almost fell asleep listening to it. I'll say one thing for Lessack; he's well-named. Instead of offering me More, I got a lot Less."
4,History of Ford Motor styling in the 30s and 40s,"A very detailed discussion of the Ford Motor Co. Styling Department and the story behind some of the most acclaimed automobile designs from Ford's golden years, The ""fat fendered"" ford products, the inception of the Lincoln Cotinental and the 39 Mercury are all intersting stories for auto enthusiasts.The book is well researched and detailed with good photos. The auther has given attention to personalities, some of whom I personnally knew and who were well drawn by Mr. Dominguez.A good read for those interested in this narrow subject."
3,Madden 64 is a decent game,Madden 64 is a decent game. The worst thing about the game is the hitting. It's really bad you can dive at a player and hit him with all your might and he won't fall down. The passing is probaly the best part about the game. It's a lot of fun to see how far you can throw it. I don't think it's worth buying. There are a lot of better football games out there
2,not up to Sony's quality,"At first this phone was wonderful. Later I found it didn't have the memory to hold all the music I wanted. I've had this phone all of 10 months. During this time the charger and the USB cable have broken. Now some of my buttons will not work. Having a 1 yer warranty I called Sony and they are telling me the buttons aren't working because my phone has been wet. My phone has never been wet. Sony says there is a spot near the battery that changes color with moisture. Well needless to say, Sony now says my phone is void of warranty(because of the moisture that never happened) and the phone cannot be repaired. I am without a phone and now will not only have to purchase a new one but will get charged for upgrading my phone before my contract ends. I will not be purchasing another Sony phone."
4,Nice Phone,"It's a nice phone. Period.Tisk, tisk . . . details. If feels good in my hand. It's light, the screen is bright. The third party PC interface disk I bought for a tenth of what Cingular charges works great. The thing is filled with land mines . . . land mines? Did I say that? Like all phones of this sort, there are millions of sneaky ways that the phone companies trick you into doing things they can charge you for -- like going on the internet. Press the wrong button, whoops, you're on the internet. Worse yet, the menus are set up so that those buttons always seem to be between anything useful and you. You know that all these phones for shills for chumps, but you've got to have them. Don't you hate that? So, in as much as shills for chumps go, it's a nice one."
4,The phone is great,"I love the phone, I have had it now for a week and I love the features. the FM radio, MP3, Internet,and even mobile TV. the sound is great no problems as some people had said and they scared me at first, but the sound quality is great.a couple of things that I dont like is that the charger slot and ear buds slot is the same, which makes it harder for this spot to live long but we will see how long that will last. compared to the phone I have had before its a little slower when transferring data, but works.Another thing that has been mentioned by someone else that the camera is not covered.GOOD THINGS: i can hear my MP3's either in my ears or let everyone hear, there is a radio incase u get bored of your music. there is a ton of features on the phone so you can never get bored. takes great pictures (but kinda slow at picking up the shot)."
3,ok,the first two movies in this collection are pretty good the last two i would not watch more than once. if you old movies or are a billy jack fan you may like this set. I was a little disapointed.
5,Underrated!,"Crossfade's Falling Away Cd is very very underrated. This cd has many hits on it, but it was not well received because they didnt have a mainstream hit like ""Cold"" or ""Colors"" this cd is a must have for any Crossfade fan or someone who likes Rock music in general!"
3,Wow...Where is the razor sharp edge? The hooks?,"If you loved the first album, especially as much as I did, then this follow-up album is not for you.... I'm not sure what the reason is, although there is much speculation--but Crossfade sounds like they have lost their soul, what made them Crossfade. I went to many of their shows when they were touring for the first album and THEY ROCKED OUT. I just can't get into the softer, slower, and sorrow-drenched lyrics they came out with on this one. The bone-crunching riffs found in ""Starless,"" ""Cold,"" ""Colors,"" and ""So Far Away"" are so far away in this second album that they are ""falling away"" to the back of my CD collection very quickly. Maybe on the next CD they will change things up."
3,destiny,"Thanks Marty. As well as being an enjoyable story, 'Destiny' is a guide by example; through your story, it tells the readers that they can find the real them, and that if they just stop for a while, they might just find that there's nothing to be scared of, in life."
5,"The Kinder, Gentler Military: Can America's Gender-Neutral","This is an excellent book. I found the chapters baffling and infuriating as they detailed my experience in the US Army, that ended nearly five years ago, from basic training to ETS. Serving in an Infantry unit, I could only glean experiences of these nuanced gender issues through contact with acquaintances in support units, or in the civilian community college I attended with other students, mostly female enlisted soldiers.I read with fervor and great anticipation of what Ms. Gutmann's conclusions would be at the end of the book. I was not disappointed!No matter what your personal stance on these issues, or your status as active or inactive military or even as a civilian, this is a valuable resource to have in reach, and acts as a potential conversational blasting cap!"
2,I think we can all agree,"I think we can all agree that this question has been satisfactorily answered by our military for the past seven years. Yes, America's Gender-Neutral Fighting Force can still win wars."
1,My dog would not touch it.,"I bought this product for my male mixed breed. He is a Golden Mix and used to weigh about 115 lbs. He is nine years old right now. But he became ill and developed a tumor in his stomach. Surgery is out of the question for him and he is skin and bones. The groomer recommended this product. I looked at the reviews and decided it would be good for him. When the product arrived I discovered he would not touch it. No matter how I tried to mask the taste or hide the product in his food, he will not eat this. I wasted all my money and now I just give him cooklies with his regular food and feed three times a day to try to keep some weight on him."
5,Comfortable and functional,"When looking for a watch, it is always most important to look at two things: comfort and functionality. This watch accomplished both of these objectives. It has a soft band that does not get sticky or rub, and it works extremely well. The hands are easy to see in the dark, and I have had no problems thus far diving with it. Great choice for anyone looking for a comfortable watch to dive in."
2,Disappointed,"Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a vegetarian. I have Sara Foster's first cookbook and absolutely love it. The pages are stained from use and every recipe I prepare is a big hit--scones, cookies, eggplant parm... This book however is lacking in vegetarian options (even sides that can be used as main dishes) and I don't find the desserts or breakfast items as exciting. I would highly recommend her first book however."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but decent pamphlet.","First, it's a pamphlet, not a book. But I expected that.I was hoping for more technical information about the rifle itself. Unfortunately, it was entirely ""this is how to handle the Sharps (and the Colt pistol and army sabre) for inspection"" instructions.If you're a reenactor interested in replicating a Civil War era drill, this is perfect for you. If like me you're more interested in learning more about the rifle itself.. pass on this one."
1,Get it...if you're a woman looking for work at a Madison Avenue firm,"Like another male reviewer, I have to say this book is way too narrow on its approach, which by itself is not bad but a little heads up in the cover of the book or the official review would be nice, hence the 1 star, so other guys will notice that this book is probably not for them.The questions are definitely good, but the answers are not, as the author gives one very specific answer, but rarely gives any general advice on what employers are looking for in your answer.Unless you somehow fit the title of this review, there are better books for you.And good luck in your job search!"
5,One of the best interview prep books I've read,"Vicky Oliver give some great, no-nonsense advice on how to answer tough questions during job interviews. After reading it, I felt distinctly more confident during job interviews and I think it definitely helped me get my current job.-D.M."
2,Infuriatingly narrow focus,"Vicky Oliver is a woman, lives in New York, and works in the advertising industry. Nothing wrong with any of that, except that she tends to forget that not everyone is exactly like her. The result of this is that if, like me, you are a man, live in South Carolina, and borrowed this book from your local library in order to prepare for an interview for an administrative position with the state Highway Patrol, much of the book might as well have been written in Chinese. Good for urban professional women seeking executive positions, but of limited use to anyone else."
5,An Ideal Interview Companion,"No one enjoys sitting in front of an interview board and be judged. And everyone has a pet fear, ""What if they think I am too old to start over"" or ""How do I explain why I quit my first job?"" You will be surprised to know how many people stay in a job they hate just because they don't want to go through the job search, especially the interview.This book is a companion that makes you realize your problem is not unique or unsolvable. For every tough interview question, there is a smart answer presented here that will turn the table around and make a positive impact.Vicky Oliver gives us sensible and witty answers that makes the reading and the interview preparation enjoyable and effective. The chapters are intuitively arranged, with a easy to read page layout, and plenty of tables and side notes. A great resource."
5,Number-one job interview book,"If you're intimidated by job interviews, this is the number-one book to get. It really was ""smart,"" as the name suggests. This book gave me the confidence to actually go for a job opening I didn't think I could get--and then I did!"
5,Great Topic and Book,"""Everything I wanted to know about interviews but was afraid to be asked. Really helpful tips and strategies for getting it right. A good read for the interviewer too."""
2,nothing happened.......,I did the directions but used a smaller amount. ive done this mask about 5 times and absolutely nothing has happened...
5,ice crusher blade,The blade got here quickly and works great. I use it all the time to make smoothies and crush up my frozen fruit. I'm very please with it.
1,Useless ice crusher blade for oster/osterizer,I bought this ice crusher blade to replace the blade in my osterizer blender. It was completely useless!! I don't even think it was the same product it claimed in the picture. It was shipped from somewhere from Mexico and had a funny motor oil smell to it. It did not crush my ice at all. I put in 6 ice cubes and after turning on the blender I ended up with 6 deformed ice cubes still at the bottom of the blender. Piece of junk I will just throw away since I don't even want to spend another $5-$6 just shipping it back...
3,ice crusher blade,Like too much of our manufactured products it is a stamped out thin piece . Looks like I will be in the market for anouther soon.
2,Ice Crusher doesn't crush Ice.,My wife uses her blender to make smoothies. The old blade was not able to do this job so I purchased one that advertized that it would crush Ice. It worked no better than the old one.
2,SONG AND DANCE MAN,BY JOHNNY PAYCHECK BUT MINE GOT STOLEN IN NO TIME FROM HOME. I LIKE HIS GOSPEL SONGS BETTER ANYWAY.
4,Good For Pictures,"This book adds the pictures to the text which is a plus. Yes the information is not new, but it is easy to read. I think it will spice both lovers by looking up the pictures while enjoying the short up to the point instructions."
1,Replacement filter has been discontinued,The Brita AVFR-200 (42647) replacement faucet filter has been discontinued. There is no replacement option for this filter. Customers that use the AVFR-200 replacement filters will have to replace their entire faucet filter system. We have listed several new faucet filter systems below that you can use to replace your entire system. Let us know if you need help selecting a new system. You can also visit our Faucet System page to browse our entire selection of faucet filter systems.
4,Good overall,"I have had this product for I think about 6 months now and I still haven't had to change the filter. When I first got it, I did have to buy an attatchment from the hardware store for my faucet. My faucet is the kind that is supposed to look like an old farmhouse faucet, so it was a little small. The attachment was only around $1 so it wasn't a big deal. The filter does leak every now and then, epecially when I use hot water, but it doesn't leak enough to bother me. It still does what it needs to do and it saves me a ton of money on bottled water."
2,B horror film,"Ok, they tried and thats why they deserved a review: The plot overall is a little old,you know,the mother gets raped and murdered in front of her kid, the kid gets nutts,goes to a hospital,grows older, escapes, and seeks for revenge. Two things in the movie that made me laugh was when one of the girls gets handcuffed to a bed (lift that side of the bed and your free!) and the other one, another girl blocks a door by putting a chair to hold the door closed by the knob(but,the door opens the other way, but nobody noticed during the film!!! o my god) ok, i still enjoy a little watching B horror films."
1,"Polar, freight and importation taxes",What bothered me the most was the fact that Amazon didn't inform that I must pay further taxes when I would withdraw the product at the Post Office.
2,Found out I couldn't take it,"I watched this thinking I would be able to just sit there and the music replacement would not bother me.I was wrong.By the time I got to Toolie's burial and not having Whiter Shade of Pale there, I had had enough.Maybe if the price is really really low, maybe I can consider getting the rest of this series, but for now I am stopping at Season 3."
3,what's up with the music ?,"i am a HUGE NX fan...where's all the good music that originally aired in the show ?????the music helped 'make' this series... (i think season 1 & 2 have most of all the original tunes)...so why didn't they use the original music on these dvds ?did they not get the permission to use all those great songs on these new discs ???doesn't make sense to me at all...VERY disappointing, indeed."
5,Very good season!!!!,"Other than the episode where Shelly sang the entire time, this season was filled with the usual banter you'd come to expect and love from the Cicely, Alaska crew!!!"
4,Northern Exposure,"This was a great TV weekly show many , many years ago. It is fun to revisit this small Alaskan town with it's many different people. It is the job of a youg Doctor to work with morden medicine and old remidies proven by it's diverse population. A moose shows up in the opening scene and adds so much to the beginning of each show."
4,Not for beginners!,"I started using Richard Simmons videos years ago because I saw people like me, overweight, doing the moves. It was motivating because I figured if they could do it (some bigger than me) then I should be able to as well. I like this video. The music is my era, but if you have never done much cardio, this isn't the place the start. You definitely don't get much instruction, as was stated in another review, and the pace is much quicker than in some of his previous videos. One thing I like about all the Blast Off videos I've seen is that you often feel more like you're dancing than doing aerobics, so it's much more fun, and anything that can make working out fun gets a definite nod from me."
2,not a good company to buy from,"i brought is pedometer with in a week its not working, and the company is giving me the run around"
2,"Looks good, easy to assemble, poor reliability","I bought it about a year ago. I used infrequently. After I connected it to Airport Extreme as a shared drive, it died. I believe it is the power supply that has gone bad. Unfortunately, it uses proprietary connector so there is no easy way to test or to replace. I have sitting on my desk as a nice shiny ""gear box"". If they had simply used more standard connector, I would have found a new power supply instead of writing this review.The enclose is attractive, it is really well made and extremely easy to dissemble to insert new drive. Ventilation is good. I just wish it was more reliable."
1,Broke after a couple of months.,This suddenly broke after a couple of months. It looks nice and shiny but is actually a cheap piece of garbage.
2,Poor performance,"Bought this from anther site , and only lasted a few months. took forever to get a cup of water hot.Was very disappointed by this, I had a Large full sized Emerson I bought back in 2000, and it gave up the ghost after 11 years.That microwave was used heavily everyday and was built solid. Just like anything else nowdays,are made cheap, and so many components and parts are made in China. I prefer japan, malaysia products. I recently bought a new Sharp 2.0 cu ft r530ekt. My mom had a Sharp for 20 years."
1,Talented woman but can't hear her voice,"This single definitely says she is in love. It is a great love song but I am not sure about the melody and the hook. It is not a huge effort. The melody outshines her voice. She has an amazing and strong voice, but I cannot hear it over the sounds of the music. Not sure if I would recommend this one. I cannot tell who it appeals to. I would not want my ....daughter listening to it, but as an adult, not sure if I like it. She is a beautiful young woman with an amazing voice, just not sure about this one."
2,Bought this pocket for my Honda DX 2000 4 Door,"This holder fits in my spare space, but it's a bit too small, leaving a noticeable gap between the holder and the stereo above it. And the holder's storage area is quite narrow and it does not use up all the space that is available for it. Moreover, the material finish doesn't match the rest of the area of my car. Not quite happy with it."
3,"Amusing read, nothing deeply profound revealed.","This book basically sits on the shoulders of a few select characters in a particular South Central, LA neighborhood. It is presumably semi (if not completely) autobiographical. The central character Garvy draws sympathy and strength. You feel for him as he is bounced back and forth emotionaly and physically in the trying neighborhood. It's not all gangs and guns like one would think, especially if you have never been to South Central. Moreover, we find a few characters seemingly trapped, physically but travel the world mentally. It's a good easy read. A long plane car/plane/train ride would go well with this book."
4,Just for the Beginner,"If you never had any experience with COBOL, this book is the place to start. Although it doesn't give many full programs for you to see, it does help you understand the way the language works. As I said, this is a great book to start learning COBOL, and you can then go on to the other books to get deeper into the language. The only problem I encountered was the Fujitsu compiler is an expired version. I've been using COBOL since 1982 and this book is on my shelf."
4,Ideal for the beginners,"This book shows you the basic knowledge of Cobol language.It explains quite well the different language features.In addition, throughout the pages of this book, some icons are used to flag important information."
3,OK,This video was OK. It was kind of boring (believe it or not) - there are some exercises where you are on the floor. I can't do that so I cut out the stomach part. I only did it twice and then put it on the shelf.
5,Richard Simmons Tons & Blast,This is an excellent workout. It's shorter than my others and I felt a better workout with it. I highly reccommend it.
5,A MIDWEST SCORCHER WITH NO CHANCE OF COOLING DOWN,"In '92 I saw a band in Manhattan, KS that, at the era of Pearl Jam and Nirvana, blew me away. That band was from Lawrence and were called Salty Iguana. 11 years later, in wichita, when my eardrums craved more hard driven rock i.e. Clutch, Kyuss, Black Nasa....I saw Gulch live with Everylasthing, who hails from Hays, and I knew that Kansas could give the world some excellent hard rock! That night I bought ENEMY OF ME and that cd is definitely in my favorite top 10. If you are fans of any of the bands I mentioned then you will definitely not be disappointed with Gulch. Like the live show, Gulch packs a punch on this cd. I do recommend it."
1,DONT BUY IT!,"Brightness isn't impressive, super short battery live when switch to halogen. Stupid button design makes it hard to switch from halogen to LED. worst of all: THIS ITEM CANNOT BE RETURNED! so don't buy it, or you will regret for sure!!!! Don't think about give it a try b/c it cannot be returned!"
1,Brinkmann light,"I bought two of these for hunting feral hogs on my ranch.I charged them like it said ,they would shine for about one hour using them on and off.That was two years ago now they won't even charge.The led light won't even come on.I would not buy another one.I bought mine from a large store."
4,One of the best!,"Two of the best science fiction books I've ever read. The first one was good, the second was better. There are some parts of this book that I will never forget. I've loaned my copies to a friend and I'll be sure to get them back for a re-read! Get this one, you won't be sorry. (No, I don't work for Amazon!"
5,"Good price, Good tuna, No complaints.",I'm glad Amazon carries this line of Tuna.And at a great price; and free shipping.I wish it was carried locally though.I enjoy eating Tuna right out of the can without having bread and mayonnaise messing it up!Adding spice is makes it twice as nice... :)MJL
3,Different Than the Picture,"When I got it, it looked nothing like the picture. One of the earpieces has a longer cord than the other, well, the cord itself is really long. But you can control the volume with the headsets and the sound is really good."
5,love it,I have been using K&N products for years and they always meet my high expectations!! To me they are the best on the market!!
1,Muffin Top Anyone??,"Yeah so not cool to have muffin top. If you order this bra, order a cup size larger than you normally wear."
5,"Outstanding, thorough, and invaluable","The information and excercises in this book are easy to understand and straightforward to follow. Often confusing design and illustration concepts are very well presented and illustrated. The level of detail is exceptional and the book's thoroughness is impressive. All of CorelDRAW 10's effects are covered with tips for web and print publishing. It includes chapters on Corel's new RAVE animation program, VBA, and Web graphics. It also comes with a convenient quick keys guide which detaches from the cover and the companion disc includes 200 additional pages of content in PDF form, tutorial files, CorelDRAW drawings, clip art, animated GIFs, digital photographs, and special effect files to use with the program. Hats off to the author and publisher. This is likely the best computer book I've seen yet."
3,It's a standard volume of what you need to know,We use it as a daily reference tool for graphic design. It seemed the best choice among several.
5,Exelent !!,"This switch is an excellent product! the quality is very good! I thought it was plastic but to my surprise is aluminum which makes it much more tough and durable! You can choose five lighting modes, 1: steady high intensity light, 2: steady light of medium intensity, 3: steady light of low intensity, 4: flashing slowly and 5: flashing fast! adjustable light intensities are good in differents situations where a flashlight may be needed and the flashing light is very useful for signaling emergency! recommend this product extensively."
1,Crude goods,I purchased two but all did not work. Maglight cannot be turned on or off at all.. besides tail LED also did not turn on at all.
5,Works Great!,"This IQ Switch works fantastic! I purchased this along with theTerraLUX TLE-5EX MiniStar2 Extreme LED Upgrade for Mini Maglite 2AA Flashlightand my Mini-Mag has been reborn into a brighter and better light than the original flashlight ever was. I like the red LED in the switch for locating the light in the dark, you just have to remember to leave the original flaslight twist switch on and turn the light off with the IQ Switch. I love this product and wish they made one for my full size 4-D cell Maglite."
3,Seemed great at first,"I gave this watch winder to my husband this Chistmas past. At first it was great, quiet, smooth. It's now February 1st. The thing spooks me at night as it's become progressively louder and sounds as if the motor is straining. I am going to check the warranty. Having no expereince with watch winders, I don't know if this issue is common. But I did some research before the purchase and had found good feeback on this brand. So best of luck!"
5,Newfoundland - Life in an English Town,"Interesting information especially for Genealogists, a bit slow to find items of interest but well done, well indexed"
5,High marks for this gem of a guide,"I checked this book out from a local library 3 times before it dawned on me that I needed to just buy it. This is an excellent guide for a relatively new knitter who wants to try felting. The author has many great tips and useful nuggets of information about felting andknitting in general, as well as reassurances along the way for when a felting project turns into something unrecognizable! I've made several purses from this book as well as modified a few of the patterns for different sizes and shapes and found the patterns are easily adaptable for simple variations. This is a ""must hav"" as far as I'm concerned."
4,Great Model!,This is a great toy but breaks easily. More of a model than a toy. You might want to glue the wheels so they don't come off. I would recommend to keep it on a shelf so it won't break.
3,Too Heavy,"Lego is a great product, unfortunately this one's just a little too ambitious. My son fell in love with this and begged for it for Chanukah, but once we got it put together it wouldn't stay together to play with. It's great to make smaller planes with, but the original plane just fell apart under it's own weight."
1,Plain out boring,"I got this cd last week, and I really wanted to like it, but the sad truth is that it's just plain boring. I'm a BIG fan of early Pink Floyd, BJM, BRMC, etc., and long songs (12 minutes, whatever) don't ""scare"" me, but too many of these tuneless wonders drag on and on without the slightest hint of originality or anything interesting. It's like they were afraid to use the fader on the mixing board. I'm as ""brave"" as the next guy, but this didn't challenge me, it just put me to sleep."
4,The Quarter After isn't that bad,"I don't know if we are listening to the same cd. None of the tunes are pedestrian. I like BJM, the Paisley bands and am an avid collector of 60's psych and I think this is a fairly decent freshman outing for this band. Their song ""Know Me When I'm Gone"" is a great Byrds inspired tune and I've been an avid Byrds fan for 43 years (125 cds and counting). Comparing them with BJM is a bit unfair since their influences are not really the same. Also, not to be mean, but at least Quarter After play their instruments in tune (unlike the mostly horrid and out of tune sitar and sitar playing on BJM cds). I know what an in tune sitar sounds like, as I've played one for 25 years. I have this cd and have not been bored by it. It could have been a bit more dynamic, but the pelting that it's gotten here is undeserved. Its a very good debut cd."
4,If you remember the 60's you weren't there but you might like these guys,"I was in a Used CD store and the Quarter After happened to be playing. All at once, myself and two other men, who were old, um, well let's say old enough to know Paul McCartney was in another group before Wings, asked the clerk what was playing. One man asked if this was a new Byrds album and I asked what 60's group was playing. Well, we were both wrong. It was this CD. I purchased it and though it might not warrant repeated playings (the lyrics are tough to hear, it seems like the group worried more about duplicating a sound rather than a message), it is definitely a fun nostalgia trip and made a 30 minute drive all the more enjoyable. Some songs sound like the Byrds, one like the Monkees, and another could have come from the Yardbirds. Upon hearing the first chords of the first song, you will swear this is old music. I suggest you purchase it just for the sense of nostalgia."
2,box light review,"It was easy to use, and looked good, however,it didn't give me a bright enough light to read by."
1,Do not buy!,"If I could, I would return for a refund. At first, I was annoyed by the fact that you can't skip the ads, only fast foward through them, so the kids still see the products. Then I realized that even though the packaging says Merry Christmas and calls it a ""magical Christmas collection,"" the episode on the DVD are about ""winter holidays,"" NOT Christmas. Even Sir Topham Hat dresses as Santa and wishes the children of Sodor Island ""Happy Winter Holidays!"""
4,Muy buen producto,"Tengo una montero dakar y para el peso de la camioneta funciona de maravilla, lo recomiendo como parte de los accesorios para el off road 4x4"
2,"Cute, but not appropriate as gift for grandfather","This is a cute book with some nice photos of grandfathers and children. However, I was looking for a book that my son could give to his grandfathers as a gift, and this book is not at all appropriate for that. Many of the entries are either a little weird or simply don't apply to his grandfathers. Examples: ""I love Grandpa because he helps me accept what I cannot understand,"" or ""I love Grandpa because he teaches me how to play pool."" If you're thinking about making your own personal version though, then this book would be good to use for ideas of what to say and what kinds of pictures to include. Some of the pictures are quite nice, and I may try to mimic a few for my own scrapbook."
5,Get it...Get it!!!,"The incredibly talented Eugene IV has set a new standard for independent artists. His music is fresh, exciting, bold and never boring. Fresh, funky and fun on songs like Get it and The Brink and socially conscious and thought provoking on Bloodshed, Dear MC, and Mama Was a Freedom Rider this sexy baritone Singer,MC, and alto Sax player leaves you changed and wanting more. Run don't walk to grab up this CD.....Get it Get it!!!"
4,Used in Toshiba Satellite 2430-S255,"The Toshiba Satellite 2430-S255 came with 512mb using 2 dimms. I had to increase the ram because I am using ms sql server 2005 developer edition on the laptop and it complained about low memory even though the instructions claim that you can use it with 512mb so I had to increase the ram. The front side buss or what Toshiba calls the ""memory buss"" is 533mhz but the fastest ddr ram at the time was 333mhz and from the toshiba website I could only find info on 333mhz so that is why I went with it. I used two 512mb chips for a total of 1gig ram.The first chip I installed in about 1/2 a second. The second chip was a brutal battle. I end up having to use a small screw driver to pull up the plastic tabs so it would hold the chip in place. But I got it together and it worked."
1,Male/Female Difference,The order was for a female USB to male ps-2. Simple. Not. I got the total opposite. All that was needed was for the order to be corrected. All that would have made me happy would have been that the correct part was going to be sent. Well bought the adapter someplace else. No problems.
5,Reassuring Book About a Mother's Love,"This is a wonderfully touching story of a mother reassuring her child of her unconditional love. It brings across very clearly the idea that we mothers love our children -- no matter what! Whether our child be a stinky skunk or a ferocious alligator, he is OURS and that is the important thing in this lovely story. With delightfully whimsical illustrations, this book brings to life the hilarious circumstances that come from a child's imagination."
5,I actually cried!,My 7-year old son received this book as a Christmas gift. I read the book to him and found myself drawn to tears. It is a wonderful book for a mother to read to their child!
5,Wonderful bedtime story!!!!!,"This is a great bedtime story. Talks about all the things that could happpen to the child (e.g. turn into a skunk, into a swamp monster, etc) and how the mom will ALWAYS love him. Wonderful illustrations! Also highly recommend her other book ""I miss you Stinky Face""."
2,Nothing special about the smell,"Don't know what's all the hype about this but it's not exactly the best smelling shampoo I've used. After I've bathed my 2 dogs with this, they had this very strong wet dog smell (or maybe it's just my nose?) the whole day. The next day, they just smelled of clean dogs... nothing special about the smell..."
5,Corvette,"This stuff is like the Corvette of dog shampoos. When you walk into the dog park smelling so fresh and looking this good, all the other males are gonna think your going through a midlife crisis. It won't matter though, soon after the bitechs will flock to you because of the intense glow emanating from your silky smooth fur. Nothing will stop you from holding that tail high while you trot from bush to bush with a pack of wild hyenas following you. Those side street hookres ain't good enough. I'm still waiting for the day I come across a lady who cleanses themselves with this same shampoo. You know if she and her owner take care of themselves as well as I do, then they'll surely be able to care for the 9 pups that I want to have. Until that day, I'll keep this stuff in my routine. It allows me to chase balls in the mud, dive for rocks in the river and sniff butts all day long, while allowing me to still clean up for the next day in hopes of meeting the one."
3,Pretty good,Nice scent. Can't really complain. I wasn't blown away though.I do love the conditioner for the dogs by this brand though.
3,Interesting but not compelling,"The author literally walks us through his encounters with shamans, fortune-tellers, and sorcerers of the Asian continent. His pace is leisurely, and he makes plenty reflections in order to make out what he observes. Perhaps a bit too many, as by the end it feels repetitious. Later in the book the characters the author encounters do not particularly stand out from the ones he met earlier, nor does the author's insight deepen alongside his route. The book is, as with the majority of travel literature, of parallel structure, and its whole does not exceed the sum of its parts (chapters). I would have enjoyed the book better had the author included a heavier dose of social context, which the author should have had at his disposal given his occupation.Overall the book is an enjoyable read, if you don't expect to learn too much from it."
4,Great!,These are so worth the money. Comes with everything you could possibly need for a long trip. Took my two year old to Tennessee and used this set and we still have pieces left that we reuse like the little bowls and stuff. Well worth the money. :) Gave a 4 star though because the sippy cup lids come off too easy which can definitely make a mess.
2,Won't buy again,"I read so many positive reviews on this set I thought I would love them too.PROS: They seal very well, even liquids. I like the smaller bowls because he can hold it with one hand in the car and reach for the snack with the other.CONS: In the dishwasher the lip of the cups and bowls retains water so I have to tip them over after the cycle is done and let them air dry standing upright. I have had these for less than a month and the plastic on the mouthpiece of the cups is coming off from my son scraping his teeth on it. I'm not comfortable with him ingesting plastic so the cups are going in the trash."
4,"Bowls and cups great, flatware not so much","The bowls and cups are the perfect size for traveling with snacks and they're good for storing toddler-size portions of leftovers. The cups are great for when kids are transitioning to ""big kid cups"", without the spill-stoppers. They have small enough holes to prevent large spills, but no rubber spill-stoppers to impede the flow of liquid while the kiddos drink. The plastic flatware is not shaped correctly for small mouths... the forks and spoons are too wide to fit into tiny mouths, so they'd definitely be better for toddlers who have not yet moved to silverware."
5,Good Book Recommended,I won't go into detail but I read this when I was in The Army in Panama. It's a good story as I remember. I just ordered it used which is very inexpensive. I think you'd enjoy reading it. Now out of print but available used. Email:boland7214@aol.
3,Not A River Runs Through It.,The book was fun to read but wasn't anything like Norman McClean in my opinion. What really bothered me was that the main character kept every fish he caught that was within the legal size limit and never once talked about eating any trout. It got a little boring while he slodged around in beaver dams and tried to find his way out of the woods. This wasn't my way of fishing or exploring.
4,An outstanding reflection of one man life and your own.,The authors challenge of fishing the entire length of Cook's Run takes you on down reflecting path of the authors life and your own. If you have a family and enjoy fishing you should read this book.
5,Mom's Heart...,"My mother heard this song on her way back from her father's funeral. It was such a deep and powerful song that she had to pull over to the side of the road and let herself regain control. Everytime she hears the song she gets misty eyed and has to take a seat. I heard the song about a week after she did and her father was more of a father and friend that grandfather, and I cried so hard when I heard the song. I loved the man so much and envy his life so much that he inspired me to follow in his footsteps and join the military. Everyone should listen to this song at least once, even if ya father is still alive, you will feel the pain and sorrow so deeply that you can't help but get alittle misty eyed. I thank the Lord everyday for a song so dear and for a young lady who can bear such powerful words."
2,Wasn't what I thought it was,"I thought I was ordering a new product, turns out it was recycled. The product didn't work well at first leaving streaks on my printed materials. Eventually it worked its way out, but I will not order this product again through this source."
5,Well written script and good acting,"This is a film made from a very well written screenplay and is nicely acted besides. A high school teacher is wrongly accused of improper conduct with a student and comes under even more suspicion and contempt because he is gay and lives with his partner. The real villain of the piece is someone I will not mention, but I think you will figure it out quickly."
3,it's good,I have been to basement bhangra at SOB several times. I really enjoy the music there and had high expectations from this CD. Even though I like the CD but it is below my expectations. I think it's good but I have a better time at basement bhangra. Don't regret the purchase though.
3,flute,"The flute was in the condition as described except a failure to note that all the pads need to be replace, about $80 extra to the total cost."
1,Forget using this in urban areas,"You get what you pay for. Don't bother using this outdoors in urban areas. Everytime you go near a power line or traffic light, the device loses its signal. This is a major distraction while trying run, and makes it nearly impossible to track your activity and cardiac workload in these areas."
1,Stopped working,"The logger stopped working correctly after a couple months. Kept indicating low battery even after I twice replaced (rather expensive!)CR2032 electronic disc-style battery. A great disappointment as it seemed to be a good deal and worked initially with accompanying software to upload my heart rate from exercise sessions and graph length and intensity of workout. Then it would only upload erratically (some days worked, others didn't record), finally the battery problem. Maybe that was why it was sold at such a discount!"
3,A little disappointed,"The dynamic range of this monitor is not very good.It seems to clip off the higher HR reading duringhard workouts. The battery life is shorter thanI expected. Also, I sent email to customer serviceat Oregon Scientific and they never responded."
4,smaller than it looks in the picture,"pros: small and light, easily and unobtrusively clips onto waistband.cons: software is kind of clunky.bottom line: just buy it- it works great, amazing price."
4,Product works,Cons:The cover the protects the usb plug in on the bottom broke or crumbled off on first use (not a big deal). The battery was dead when it arrived and had to replace it.Pros:Easy to use and it is Cheap.
1,"Good idea, stopped functioning after one use.","I bought this product because it fit my specific wants. The battery was dead, I replaced it and it worked fine. I tested it for two or three trial periods to which it recorded fine and data transfer worked great. I used it for one long event; the logger recorded for the entire 5 hour span and data was retrieved fine. Now it does not work at all. Battery registers fine, but the unit only blinks red twice which does not coincide with any patterns in the manual. I've tried it a couple of times since then with no luck. This item is useless to me now. Great potential with a great first couple of uses, then dead and useless within three days."
5,Radical,"I was a huge Duran fan back in the day. This is one of the best albums, album covers, and videos of the 80's. Haven't listened to the whole album in years. It is great as ever."
1,Whazzis?,"The only information provided a hopeful buyer of this album is the title. The music might vary from the sublime to the ridiculous. Tell us, O Amazons, describe the music, the players, give a few soundbites of the music."
2,Gypsy Kings wannabes,"Sar e Roma consists of Stevo, Branko, Goran, Bato and Hari -- that's all the CD tells us. They sing in Romany: usually solo male, sometimes female or group vocals. Instrumentation is mostly acoustic guitar with occasional darabuka, though they play tamburica on a few tunes.Much of the CD is continental Gypsy Kings-style music, performed with energy but not enough polish to be more than ordinary. Three songs caught my ear: Ushti and Baro Foro, two men's songs in Vojvodina style with Rom choruses, and Maljarkica, a pretty women's a cappella song with a similar semi-Magyar flavor. If someone told me this band was the tenth-best Rom cafe combo in Subotica, I'd believe them. If you're fond of Gypsy songs and aren't too picky about musicianship, it might be worth its modest price."
1,Not so Sweet,"The history in this book is wonderful. However, the recipes are very inconsistent. Missing ingredients, etc. make it impossible to use this cookbook. I tried twice to make the Little Tea Cookies (pg.70) with no success. The dough would never come together (obviously some ingredient is missing)."
1,Not Very Impressive,"Great history IF you want a cook book that gives you history VS RECIPES. Too much history....Just the fact that there are ingredients missing....is amazing. I noticed the pistachio chewey cookies....NO FLOUR!!!! Yet, the picture clearly depicts that those cookies have flour in them....Recommending margarine instead of butter where margarine is much more watery than butter....causing very runny batters (cream puffs)....I think it needs review if ingredients are missing. I can't stand typos either."
3,Seems to be helping my game...,"Warning!!! My results probably will not be typical!!! I am a less than average player. My handicap is capped at 18 (that's as high as my league allows for men), and shoot between 70 and 57 on nine holes.I have been playing seriously for the last two years, and only seen marginal improvement. I used these balls as a filler to get free shipping, and because I want to standardize more of my game (I was playing with whatever I could find).My first game after I got these balls I shot a 52. It seemed like I didn't have to worry about hitting the ball hard, just a nice easy swing. I was driving as far as the 7-8 handicappers in my four-some, and my iron shots (the ones I didn't duff) were going straighter. This ball also putts very well. It seemed to fly off the face of my putter. I recommend practicing with these balls to see how they putt."
1,Limbo: Ultra soft or ultra-thud?,"I ALWAYS bounce-test new golf balls against a proven product, on smooth, hard concrete. Of the first four of 16 new Intech Limbo Ultra Soft golf balls I bought today at Wal-Mart, two were duds. No, they were ""thuds."" To be specific, the thuds bounced about 1/3 less than the good ball.Pricewise, they look great. The quality control obviously isn't there.Don't buy 'em. Beware!"
1,Not airtight,"I bought these elsewhere, and now I am on here looking for replacements - moths got into them - imagine that!!Do not buy these - they do not seal properly."
3,"weak on the smaller towns, unreliable for hotels","I have some prejudice against this guide because of its high recommendation of a spectacularly horrible hotel in Corfu (room like a cell, property overrun with chain-smoking German package tourists). It has the usual Michelin virtues of good maps with star-rating prioritization of sites. Not as much information about smaller towns as Lonely Planet and not as many maps. A good but not a great guide."
1,Shocking,I was about to order this watch and the price went up from forty something to over ninety in a week period. I have to find something else.
1,"out-dated information, ambious configuration explaination","You have to buy it, because no other choice. Cisco just want to keep helpful technical documents in secret, and force people to buy their TAC service. No more Cisco PIX firewall after this time."
5,The ONLY solid book on the PIX platform,"Excellent book, well written and concise. This book maps to the CPSFA exam, and is what I used to prepare for the exam. This is the only book I have seen which covers all aspects of the PIX platform, models, software, configuration, etc. Also contains detailed scenarios and references. Highly recommended!"
1,Wonder Years from World Music,The video was not viewable at all. It is very jumpy and choppy. I do not recommend purchasing it.
1,Absolute Junk,They were complete junk. The straps broke after using them to play Church softball for only 1hr. i sent them back
5,Watching Superfriends with your kids is great.,"I purchased these dvds so that I could share the experience, that I remembered as a kid, with my kids. It worked, and they loved them."
3,Doesn't Cover Everything,"I have been programming in PHP for about 5 years now. I was looking for a printed reference to the language, essentially a dictionary for PHP, and decided to buy this. Although it documents some functions well, it does not document them all - for example it does not mention the htmlspecialchars function anywhere in the book. Another bad point that I noticed is that it feels very much like the first version, which it is, and has typos; even typos in the documentation of core functions like labeling htmlentities as ""html_entities"" (real function does not have an underscore).My recommendation would be to find something else, or wait until they publish the 2nd edition."
5,AccuReach Plus massager,"I love the product, but I can't find it anywhere. I have a big knot on my shoulder blade and it hurts a lot. Unfortunately I can't reach it myself. My mom has one and it works great on it. But I can't locate one to purchase. On the websites it either sold out or currently not available."
1,Don't bother with this produce,"I believe this product mentions that it will ""even out skin tones"" among other things. It does NOT. It is also greasy to a degree that don't get it too close to your eyes -- your eye makeup will smudge. It was a waste of money in my opinion."
4,Rip Van Winkle Investing,"Hebner skillfully debunks the active asset management style marketed by most investment professionals and lays out a long term wealth accumulation strategy that works. The book is a visual delight with beautiful reproductions of works of art and has a compendium of apt quotations. However he fails to adequately deal with the newer ""enhanced"" indexes like Rob Arnott's fundamental indexing and equal weighted indexes which many believe solve many of the problems which cap-weighted indexes present. Overall a ""must-read"". Two thumbs up!"
3,"Better Than Horrid ""Maltin"", But Misses Some Movies.","I agreed with theses people much more than terrible Leonard Maltin, ... They gave movies I enjoy pretty good reveiws. Note: Maltin thinks Friday The 13th deserves 1/2 stars. They think it deserves three. I agree. It's not a terrific movie, but it still isn't complete junk. I liked Betsy Palmer. Anyway, Maltin just hates everything, these people seem to try hard to find something good about the movie before calling it awful. Although, the cover shows a shot for American Beauty, but it's not actually in here. And, some of their reveiws are WAY to short. Like, for example, Ghoulies. They said in their reveiw ""Gruesome. Rated PG-13 for Violence and Sexuality."" What a helpful reveiw, NOT! I, myself, don't beleive in criticts, I just watch a movie and decide whether or not I like it. You should, too. ..."
5,Delightful musical journey,This is by far the best of the baby einstein cds. I would highly recommend it :)
4,Interesting,I'm a Tim Tebow fan. I enjoyed the movie and learning more about him. I would recommend it to any sports fan
3,Tebow,This was a fascinating look into how the whole Football draft works and into how much work it took Tebow to get ready for the draft and surprisingly how much effort the Broncos went through to get him only to one year later toss him to the wind. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Tebow - and is interested in his journey into the NFL.
5,What a neat book!,"I always knew that babies were smarter than most adults gave them credit for, and this book proves it. It was facinating to read about how babies learn. As a first-time mom with twins, I struggled with what to do with these new bundles of joy. This book encouraged me to use the world around us as a learning experience for them at such a young age."
2,dissapointed,"Hey I liked the rapper, I've been to Rehab, and I could relate to his lyrics. ""F*ck you motherf*er I need liquor too"" I didn't know he left the band until i listened to the album. The singer is cool too don't get me wrong, i just want a little more cheesy gangsta S, and goofy raps. I give this two stars, for the 7 stars I wanted to give Southern Discomfort. If your in to redneck rap get Southern Discomfort, if you like acoustic guitar and mellow though somewhat melodramatic signin' buy this album, I the only person who didn't like it so far, so maybe I'm the idiot, don't be misled about the rapper though."
5,Better than expected,I was really only expecting to like the Bartender Song but I was surprised by how many good songs are on this CD. It reminds me of 80's music for some reason and that's why I love it.
5,"Good introduction to technic, Great for tractor lovers","Our son is just getting into Technic, and is a huge lover of all things John Deere, so we got this for his birthday to stretch him a bit. It was a little challenging for him, since he is young, and this was his first experience with Technic. He got some adult help in the beginning but pretty quickly worked out how the pieces work.We were particularly pleased that it is a working model. The wheels turn a drive shaft that goes back to cause the blades of the attachment to turn. The attachment can also be lifted up and turned off.He enjoyed building it a lot, but unlike block Legos, usually doesn't take it apart, but rather plays with it built. Months later it still a favorite."
3,Disappointing,"Tim Marlow is knowledgeable and passionate about art. But I'm afraid these programs are spoiled by his words. As if constantly pressed for time, he omits pauses between sentences and paragraphs, forcing one's mind to race constantly to keep up with him. His English itself is surprisingly flawed, suggesting uncompleted lessons in grammar and syntax (compare Kenneth Clarke's ""Civilization,"" which is superb in all aspects except for its Islamophobia). The camera is often used improperly: sometimes it shakes too much, other times it sweeps across a room too quickly, and at least once it is placed at his feet and is pointed upward at him for an effect which the producers presumably thought would be cool but which only comes off as pretentious, I'm afraid. But the program is worth watching all the same, for Mr. Marlow is so good-looking as to compete with that part of the show that is beyond reproach, namely, the art."
1,ink not continuous,"This pen is terrible. The ink doesn't flow continuously, leaving white gaps instead of letters. Also not particularly comfortable to use, as the grip is hard and plastic-y."
1,ABSOLUTE WORST,"Your very foolish if you order this Pen. It is the worst in oh so many ways. The most roughest pen I ever wrote with Does not write on all paper Just horrible. Save your money I thought I was buying something similar to the Jetstram I ordered. I'm so happy Amazon makes returns so easy.Stay away from this one.uni-ball Signo Gel 207 Retractable Roller Ball Pen, Medium, Translucent Barrel, Black Ink, 4 per Pack ( 33960PP)"
2,traditional no but authentic yes,"Although the person before me reviewed this cd as bogus, if one can understand that the people of the Philippines and other countries in Asia idolize many musicians of the US especially from the fifites and the eighties, than can understand how this cd is quite authentic to the people of the Philippines and it's quality to represent the sounds one might hear if they would travel to the islands. In addition, from a person of the US how can they say that this is bogus when swing and rockabilly of the 90's such as Squirrel Nut Zippers and Big Bad Vodoo Daddy obtain their popularity by apporiating sounds from their predecessors."
3,Nice watch,"I really like this watch, it's accurate and stylish, the only thing I don't like is the band is somewhat uncomfortable. Wish it was an adjustable band."
2,"Don't bother. Boring,not a horror movie,stinks.","This is a waste of money. It is boring, a bunch of people talking, will not keep your attention, another words,stinks."
3,Liked the Eerie Visuals but Pace of Film Terrible,"Whoever did the visuals of Alice the ghost for this film, did a wonderful job. I enjoyed the stills, the videos, the cell phone footage. The jerkiness of the footage also makes it believable that the family is trying to get their own footage of her. The rest of the movie, however, is them talking in a mockumentary style about Alice's death, these manifestations, their consults with a psychic, etc., These are very plodding in pace and tend to be one note in rendition. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a first film effort. I think this film shows a lot of promise for its director and cinematographer. However, they really do need to learn how to get a script to move on the screen. It plods and that is not good."
3,Meh,Pretty much what you would expect...not a lot actually happens. I gave it 3 stars because I did enjoy the dynamic in which it was filmed but not much else. The plot is lacking a lot
3,Worth watching but not groudbreaking.,"I liked this film. Compared to similar films in the horror mocumentary / found footage sub-genre (Quarantine/Rec, Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc...) Lake Mungo is polished and well executed. The acting is strong and the narrative tight and well paced.That said, if you've seen David Lynch'sTwin Peaks: The Complete Series (The Definitive Gold Box Edition)NOTHING in this film will surprise you. It seems that Annie Palmer and Laura Palmer are kindred spirits on two different continents. Still, if you like this type of film you could certainly do a lot worse and even though I knew what to expect from the major plot elements it was an enjoyable 90 minutes of entertainment."
3,Just okay..slow moving,"From the previously written reviews, I thought this movie would be better. It moved slowly, was slightly creepy but very anti-climatic. There are a few twist and turns that make it entertaining but these scripted documentary movies have been done before and better than this. It was somewhat original regarding her ""so-called secret life "" but it was not a secret life, just one action that is out of character for her. I wanted them to expand on this concept.Overall just ok and would not recommend."
4,Works and easy to get ribs off rack,"Works for ribs, easy to get them off rack. I tried putting potatoes on the skewers but they get in the way of the ribs hanging out."
3,Book review,"This book provides an quick insight of current OO patterns. Content is somewhat usefull, but related to much to testing patterns. It's good for a beginner programmer who want to start a project using OO.The quality of the paper and ink is like a home made printed book. The price is too high for that quality."
2,"Beware, Kindle users","As most of the reviews agree, the BEST part of this book is the CD, that helps you to relax and meditate. The Kindle version comes with a transcript of the cd and the Text-to-Speech feature enabled, but don't expect it to be ANYTHING like the original CD: no music, no soothing and relaxing voice, no Brian guiding you....it won't do the job. Why wouldn't they include and MP3 with the original content of the cd? Beats me!"
3,Game almost meets expectations....,"The games are fun and you can waste hours playing them! It took a while to get used to how small everything is on the screen and in some cases it seems like they could have made it bigger. Also, the instructions for the games are not very detailed so you sort of have to work out how to play as you go along. Pretty fun overall though."
3,"Good, but not quite as good as brainage","This is a good game, but brainage suduko is better. Some of the graphics in this one are a bit small, and the instructions don't help if you don't know how to play the game already. But good game for the money."
2,OK,This nintendo ds game did not challenge me as the Brain Age games. It appears much more simplistic but a younger individual would have a great time with this game.
5,This album changed my life...,I used to get really high and listen to this when I was a teenager. I used to think it was one of the most amazing albums at the time. Now I'm 30. Recently revisited it. Still holds up! No mind altering substances needed. I love this album. I always wondered if there ever was a studio outtake of Feel Happiness hiding somewhere cuz that song sounds like it could have been included on this album...
5,One of their bests,"I came to this band through Steven Wilson, who said that ""The Seer"" was the best record of 2012. This is, I Think, their second best album, very close to ""the Seer""."
3,Swans burn out into nothingness like a distant star.,"The Swans have always been one of those bands that, if you have heard of them at all, you revered or loathed. Their live shows were terrifying, throbbing, churning blasts that had little in common with their recordings, but seemed to have a life all their own that made them one of the most sought-after tickets of their time. This double album was the ""cleansing burst of energy"" that Michael Gira promised, but don't look for the monotonous grindcore of their early albums or the Leonard Cohen-esque grandeur of 'The Burning World' or 'Children of God'. This is instead a ethereal (one hates to say ""ambient"" in reference to a band of this power)sonic landscape with a handful of actual songs and a whole boatload of found-sounds and synthesized noise. Does it work? That depends on what you want to remember about the Swans. Personally, I view this last studio work as the necessary afterglow to 'The Great Annihilator', a wave goodbye from the wasteland."
4,Nice Big size watch,"I got this watch last week as I liked the dial design . only I could not wear it as my hand rest size is a bit smaller than the watch, the watch is a bit heavy and needs larger arm rest, that's why I needed to sell it.overall it's good for the price and has a solid body and looks expensive and tough."
3,fair,"Seurat has a number of magnificent drawings.Very few are in this book, although if you look hard, you can find a small sampling of interesting drawings, like ""Plowing,"" ""The Colt"", and ""The Invalid.""There are also a couple of worthy primitive figure sketches buried in there.To its credit, the book does let you see how Seurat's mind transitionedfrom heavy textures, to patterns, and finally, to dots.Print quality is decent.There is another, more expensive book that I highly recommend:Georges Seurat The Drawings, reveals an amazing talent."
4,"AudioSource PSW100 10"" 100-Watt Powered Subwoofer","First let me say this sub delivers excellent sound at an excellent price.However I was disappointed to discover that whlie the product description says it is ""autosensing"" for power----that is not the case. There is no auto position for the power switch.Other than that inconvience it is an excellent buy."
1,Why is Amazon selling dogfighting books?,"Seriously, Amazon, you're selling books promoting animal abuse? Have you no standards? You wouldn't sell how-to books catering to pedophiles, so why are you catering to dogfighters by selling this awful junk? Wake up!"
4,Beautiful and easy-to-use for novices like me.,"I don't think vegetables have ever looked as good as they do in this book. Most of the recipes are simple with fewer than four steps to follow. I purchased it in America, and much of the language sounds British which leads to confusion. However, I consider this cookbook extremely useful, visually appealling, and definitely essential."
5,Comprehensive and beautiful,"This cookbook is great for those trying to switch to a vegetarian diet, because it is beautiful and mouthwatering so it will really make you want to try all the recipes and explore the different kinds of dishes.The book had an introduction to vegetarian nutrition (but not very comprehensive, so read different sources too!) and several special insert pages detailing ingredients like soy, tofu, tempeh, and the like, which may be unfamiliar to those of us new to this kind of cooking.It has lots of recipes, for all kinds of ocassions and meal types. I recommend this book to all cooks, vegetarian or not, who want to get more tasty vegetable dishes on their table!"
2,naysayers are right. download nottingham lace and forget the rest,"SOAD collaboration just sounds wierd, i love some of the stuff that SOAD does; in small doses. this cd just feels off to me, i dont dig it. but nottingham lace truly is one of the best songs buckethead has ever written, truly epic."
5,"Stunning, original album","I expected great guitar work, and Buckethead delivers, but the album is also diverse and fun to listen to. Highly recommended. It leans towards the metal / shredding side of things, and has enough changes in the songs to keep you interested."
4,I like this guy,"I like this guy. He really has a command of intuition, but I feel like he is always in a state of self-doubt. He manages to feel the moment and creates a passing second that lives vividly, but then he philosophizes beyond the moment and wastes the opportunity to be profound. Still, I like this guy. He tells me a lot about the beating heart, the hot blood,the cool calculation, the keen insight, the flat out lie."
2,"Dishonest ""Analyis""","As the subject here addressed is relevant to my work as a university administrator, I read this book with some curiosity. There is some marginally good points offered for consideration, but what is good is not new, and what is new is not good. What in particular is not good is the pretense that the book contains true policy analysis. Despite some embarrassingly amateurish posturing, this is plainly a case of anecdotes and statistics conveniently marshalled in service of monocular ideology rather than honest analysis. Indeed, as those of us closer to the situation are aware, even some of the facts that the author harps on are not as convenient as the author would like, which prompts several instances of heavy-handed editorializing so that one side of the competing policy goals is wildly overblown while the other side is closed-mindedly marginalized. Would that this charade were carried of with even a modicum of deft rather than with a tone of barely disguised stubbornness."
3,teen bible,"was older than expected and the cover was damaged. with a twelve year old it didn't last very long before it was torn completely off. i like the bible though. it's informative, motivative and inspires young minds to consider useful questions about the word of God."
5,A great Bible,"This is truly a great bible. It helps teenagers like myself show what the bible says to us. It has some awsome features that help you understand God's word. The ""Dear Sam"" advice column is truly unique he gives great advice based on God's word. Jericho Joe the cute little cartoon shows up in unexpected places and provides a light hearted touch. This bible has really helped me understand god's word."
1,album took too long.... nevermind...,"Since the release of his first single, I eagerly waited the arrival of this album... the record company should have known when a single is hot! Everybody wants it now!!!! not 4 to 5 months, or however long it took for the release of this album... as time passed on... so did my interest to purchase this album.... sorry brian..."
2,"If you've read one chapter, you've read them all",I was astounded by the number of times Lemann said the same thing over and over as if she were making a new point. The only interesting character was the absent husband of whom we saw very little. This novel needed some serious editing and plot development.
2,Dude!,"The one thing I'm really impressed about in this book is the number of worn-out, overused cliches about Southern California that can be fit into one book. And repeated so often. Truly, she is a good writer in terms of characterization and plot. Let's just hope her next book isn't about stupid Southerners, African Americans addicted to watermelon, or women who have hysteria."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas. There were no dimensions, so based on the picture I thought it was going to be bigger. Also you can't detach the horse from the carriage, unless you break it, which my two daughters already did. Luckily, the 2 year old loves Belle and horses, so she will still play with it. But what a disappointment!"
1,Mediocre film backed by poor journalism,"I have to agree with some of the comments made by other reviewers that posted negative feedback. I found this film to be an embarrassment to Nat'l Geographic's prestigious reputation. Several claims and ascertains are posed but are supported with absolutely no evidence. I'd describe this film as sensationalized, not a serious piece of journalism. The tone of the film is bogged down by persistent and repetitive fear mongering, which detracts significantly from the potential of the film. A great portion of the filming time was used to repeatedly describe MS 13 as something to fear, a menace, a quickly spreading ""virus"" that's quickly spreading across the country to your city and your neighborhood. It seems as though the filmmaker's target audience is middle-aged suburban Americans. I feel as though NG could have produced an equally informative film in half the time if they omitted all the noise about being very, very afraid."
1,Waste of Time,"Normally, I'm a big fan of NG documentaries, but this was terrible. The whole thing was redundant and repetitive.Quite absurd if you consider gangs and groups in other parts of the world like Africa, Brazil and even smaller cities in Southeast Asia."
5,Casual----An all time Favorite Fragrance,"Discovered this fragrance in the 90s and still love it, but it is hard to find. I love the women's and men's versions. It is perfect any time of the year, and I get so many compliments when I wear it. Not too heavy and very clean smelling!!!!"
4,"Good item, recommend to buy!!","Very nice!! Had to contact seller for I needed accu-chek advantange and he sent me comfort curve. Still everything works,"
5,A Challenge Worth Taking,"This is not an easy read. The idiosyncratic use of language is befuddling yet amusing, constantly surprising the senses. We are taken through a world of innocence, brutality and sympathy. Does the use of language define our ability to experience life? What are the bounds of human suffering?This book was like a box of chocolates--rich language and images that could only be tasted in morsels. I read the translated version and I wonder if the French version has the same amazing twisting of idoms and strange juxtapositioning of images. A deeply disturbing book, but an enervating read."
3,theory heads from outer-space,"Okay, I admit: the title sounds like a cosmetics manual. But it's really a collection of essays from a NYC conference about 10 years ago. For some reason, the men (Kobena Mercer, Richard Fung) are much better. They seem to know more about work being made. The women (DeLauretis, Judith Mayne) are interesting, but maybe too academic: too much theorizing based on too little material, focus on not-so-good historical (Dorothy Arzner) and more recent (Sheila McLaughlin) filmmakers makes it seem out of touch. Totally misses any of the more recent queer/grrl media, which had begun to surface by that time.Some of the discussions add a bit of ""grit"" otherwise missing from the all-too-polished talks.You'd never guess, from the volume, much of anything about the queer media explosion about to happen."
2,ugh.,"i loved the old harvest moon for the snes. however, this was nothing like what i expected. maybe i just don't dig the anime thing much, but i couldn't stand or get into this game. it was probably one of the most dull gaming experiences i've ever had to experience.first of all, i hate the monster dungeons. when i play harvest moon, i want to be a farmer, not a warrior. the combination of the two seemed pretty... strange. if you're into that kind of thing though, then awesome. i'm not.second of all, you can court/flirt/whatever the girls in the town. all of them have absolutely zero personality. they're boring as hell.it's a shame, but i didn't spend too much on this and i was able to trade it back to a store for almost the price i paid. not my thing, might be yours. unfortunately i got no enjoyment out of this game."
1,Boring...Just no fun at all.,"My son ordered this game, even saved his own allowance to get it. He is very unhappy. He found the game boring, and hard to do. Plus he could not find any cheats or help online to see if he was missing something. Considering he LOVED harvest moon this game was a real disappointment"
4,Better than I expected,"I bought this game for a friend of mine and he did nothing for 4 days except go to school and play RuneFactory on his DS.I think this game is realy good, I tried it out my self and I basicly didn't want to give him his game back.I recomend you buying this game if you like farming games (running a farm) and killing some monsters. This combination worked excelent from my point of view."
4,My wife's playing it...,"My wife loves these games, and now that she flew through Professor Layton, she's deep into this. Some of the controls take getting used to, but it's the classic Harvest Moon formula mixed up with some RPG and adventure elements. A must-have for Harvest Moon fans."
5,the Best Charger I've Used,"This charger just does what all chargers should do: Charge batteries with no drama!As a Photographer with many Speedlights and external battery packs, I go through a lot of AA batteries - 10 per flash, 3 to 5 flashes units per shoot. I want no drama in the equipment I use and would rather leave that for the actors I'm photographing! I've been using the Energy 16 for well over a year now and it has been rock solid; and I just ordered a second.As chargers go, it is by far not the least expensive, but for me, it is well worth it!"
2,dessert plate rack,"I purchased two of these racks, I did not do the math. There was no size plate that this fit. I purchased them keying on pie rack and it came up. Pie's don't fit on this particular rack. I think it would be important to put in the size of plate the rack would hold....oh well that one was on me....dessert plate!"
1,Same Problem Reported By Others,"As others have reported in the past, the projected numbers on this clock are now illegible and can no longer be read.This expensive clock is NOT a good value. I cannot recommend it because based on my experience (and others), you will almost certainly have to replace it before long."
3,"pretty good, but..","this isn't a bad book, it must be entertaining because i read it in a few days. it covers all the drama drama drama surrounding the beach boys. however, i felt like all this was covered, and written much better, in ""wouldn't it be nice"" by brian wilson. if you read that amazing book, there's really no need to read this unless you just need something to read."
4,Wow,"Never before have a read a book so thorough about the people who make up a band and the music that was produced. In a way, too much at the same time as just enough. Incredibly interesting!"
1,Not Recommended,"This Go Video recorder has been nothing but problems for me. It has already been replaced twice in less than six months by the store I purchased it at because it stopped working. The TV Tuner went out on the first two, and now, one month after getting the third one as a replacement, the Tuner has stopped working again. On top of that, when I try to record from any source I now get a clicking noise along with a ""preparing DVD"" message on screen that never goes away. I'm through with Go Video products. If I get another DVD recorder it will be another brand, but I'll read the reviews first."
1,Don't buy anything from GoVideo!,"I bought this exact DVD recorder from QVC for $[...]. It was not user friendly for recording and I wound up just using it as a second DVD player. I have it 2 years but used it maybe 50 times. I can't get the disk tray open and my 3 1/2 year old's Nemo DVD is stuck in there. I contacted GoVideo via email since all other ways were impossible and this is the response I got today and I quote: ""Go Video no longer offers tech support or customer service."" Hello! I looked up reviews on all GoVideo products offered now or at one time from Amazon and they are all basically the same as mine. Stay away from this brand!"
4,"And in the eighth symphony, Branca creates a masterpiece","Choosing whether to rate this CD four stars or three is a difficult choice, since the disc contains two symphonies and not one, and because not all of the music is entirely successful. I have chosen to give the disc four stars, since the second movement of Symphony No. 8 is absolutely magnificent: twenty-minutes of soaring guitars that continually push into higher and higher estatic states and eventually climax into a fanfare. The CD is worth buying if only for this piece alone. Definitely a must-hear for anyone interested in contemporary music."
2,Tedium and more.,"This is my first Glenn Branca record, (It was a d/l not a store purchase). And while the idea of having a electric guitar symphony is nice, there's just not much 'there' there.This is basically just 60 minutes of feedback along with the most pedantic horrible drumming I've ever head. The drummer does just a cymbal ride for what seems like 10 minutes during one song, and the rest of the time it's just the same thumps with no variety or flair.The guitar work is okay, if you enjoy feedback and skronk (I usuually do), but there just needs to be a little more variety for me to recommend this."
4,Excellent Book but Nearly Obsolete!,"This is a title that's desperately needed, but it's November 2005 and DB2 is bordering on version 8.3 or 9.1 already. Where's the update? I know, I know. People say 8.2 isn't THAT different. I disagree, especially if I'm going to shell out $30 shipped."
3,GE phone,"I loved the older model, without the caller ID feature. The only problem I had after 3 years of use (had an extra battery)is the mouth peice over the years began to break away from the headset and you couldn't hear very well at times. You might say the family wore it out! Loved the design, great to be hands free while talking and walking in the house as well as outside the house in the yard! The reception was great! I am on the way to buy the new model and put it to the test!"
4,LOVELY!,"Very pretty earrings and the detail is dainty, yet perfect for every occasion. I bought the matching pendant also and it make such a nice pairing. Casual, but classy."
3,it was ok,I saw the title of the book and I was really excited to read it. I was slightly disappointed. It was a slow read and there were some places where it was unclear to me what was going on. The introduction was really really long and the mystery started a third of the way into the book. There were a few parts that really stood out and caught my attention but then it went back to being a slow read. I guess there was just some bad pacing?
2,An uneventful read,"This was the third or fourth book I've read in this series and found this particular one rather dull. It was just like when kids are in school and the teacher gives an assignment for a 1,000 word composition. You start counting and throw in sentences just to make the word count. I felt as though descriptions were added to the book just to make it long enough. There wasn't much emphasis on sleuthing either - mostly information about the antique cars. I hope that the remainder of her books go back to more needlework themes and more ""detective"" work."
3,Starting to Drive the Wrong Way,"Like the other Betsy Devonshire Needlecraft Mysteries, this story is pretty thin and the characters are fairly two dimensional. But it is light, fun reading for needleworkers who enjoy mysteries.This time the story is centered around an antique car run and is only tied to Betsy's needlework shop by a thin thread. But once again, Betsy is just a step away from a murder - this time, supplying an alibi for the victim's wife.In this installment, I found there to be too much about the cars and not enough about the needlework for my taste. I also thought two of the subplots were left dangling. But as a light mystery novelty, this book was still an enjoyable read. Just don't expect Arthur Canon Doyle's style when you pick it up!I'm certainly glad *my* local needlework shop owner is not this prone to being around murder victims! I'd like to see Betsy solve the mystery to another type of crime."
4,Attempted Return To Innocence,"This certainly is a wonderful creation. Lewis recognized the jumbled priorities of Americans in the early twentieth century. Out of this relization, which became more obvious and blatant the more he considered it, he created Babbit. He designed this character to show that financial success is worthless. In the capitalistic haven of America, financial success is pushed to the forefront of our hopes and expectations. At the same time, Man is endowed with a yearning to return to nature, to innocence. Babbit heroicly attempts such a return. Lewis also sends us a message similar to Thoreau's. He questions the neccesities of life and reasons for our tempestuous need to complicate them. As a bonus, the pages are riddled with wit and humor. I heartily recomend this novel."
1,Documentary? Rather empty video clip...,"This doc tells us anything at all. For example, in the second part, we see people fighting in something like a market place (is it? we don't know), and we don't know at all who is fighting and what for. And, that's immoral Mr Longley, this scene is filmed like a video clip. Unlearning doc. Undoc doc. I do not understand all those film festival prices..."
4,opinionlink,The USB attachment for the watch does not connect to the watch. It is too small. However the watch is OK.
2,Not worth the cost of ownership,"This watch is a fairly good watch, well worth the price and five stars; if it never needed repair. This watch has broken several times in just a couple of years. They charge every time you need it repaired even if it is under the short warranty that the watch has (it's just cheaper)Break history:Weird text on the display won't go awayThe spin thing on the side came offThe watchband brokeIt refused to connect to the computer (it broke this way twice)It got water soaked in it, and the display quit"
5,Review of Data Link Watch,I love the Data Link watch. This will be my 4th watch. I could not function without the Data Link. The only thing I do not like about the watch is it is cheap looking. Can not lay watch flat on dresser because of the curved band.
3,Timex Mens Ironman USB Watch,"I own one of these watches and the resin band broke.I bought a new watch because initially I could not find a new band.The new watch arrived and when you pushed the stem the watch did a reset. The stem is an integral part of how the watch works so this was unacceptable. This also seems to be an all too common complaint.The goods news I called Timex and they sent me a new watch with a box to return the old watch. The cost was $7. The new watch works fine and the repair tech had advised that replacement bands were available on the web, so I got one of those too. I like my watch and am generally very satisfied after the initial hassle."
3,Calor y Frio,"Some facts about this DVD1. Volumes I & II are both on one DVD2. There are 26 sections, for a total running time of 55 minutes3. It's a useful revision tool for beginners learning Spanish4. Some sections are more helpful than othersThis DVD is useful for helping students to remember basics such as the parts of the body, numbers, colors, the alphabet, and simple phrases. The music is catchy, and the pronunciations are clear. The actresses are pretty attention grabbing also.In some of the other sections however, they rattle off the most peculiar phrases that you'll never, ever remember or need to know, and we often just skip over these. I also think that they go a little too fast sometimes, but at least you can listen to the correct pronunciation of the words.We generally just show the section relevant to what the child is doing in school to complement his class work, and reinforce what he's learned.Amanda Richards, April 24, 2008"
1,all dried up,The box arrived as expected but over half the paints had a hard cottage cheese consistancy and were not usable.
5,Rock n Roll the way it was meant to be!,"I have heard many artists who try to write simple, straight from the heart pop songs in the vein of Paul Westerberg and Tom Petty, but few can pull it off like WAZ. These songs have hooks that will be stuck in your head for days. It's catchy rock n roll with no BS! Buying this CD will only make your life better."
5,One Of The Most Underrated Bands Ever....,"This band is incredible. Think Pixies meets Fugazi, but for real this time (that comparison is used so much, but this is the real deal). If you liked Monsula or Fuel, please check this out."
1,Tin foil hats,"The tin foil hat brigade are the only ones who will believe this drivel. Or even be able to finish the book. Repeats a lot of hearsay, spends too much time on UFOs, shilling for the author's previous books, repeating various nonsensical rubber room rants. Some sections are hard to follow for the non bi-polars among us. I don't believe in PX outside of anti-magnetic mine degaussing, and was only reading it for fun. It wasn't, and I gave up."
1,Be careful if you have Win xp or 2000,"I never got this product to work in either of these environments. After many e-mail's back and forth to thier support people(they were always responsive), I finally gave up this weekend. At first they suggested a fix from the Microsoft website, when that did not work I installed a fix from the SAS website. I installed that fix over the Christmas weekend and it did not work either. I was receiving messages similar to ""not authorized to file xxxxx"" and ""v6 engine not installed"". Since my employer uses this software I was really hoping I could get it to work, but no luck. I hope they get these problems fixed, because this product in my production environment is very useful."
5,This book has it all,This is a great book. It covers everything from sketching to color techniques. Another bonus is that there are several framable prints inside as well. Worth every penny.
3,watercolor Faries,"The book is fine. It's not really a how-to or step by step sort of set up. Looks like you would have to do the reading and not just pick it up, find what you wanted to do and do it. Pictures are beautiful."
3,Red Dog,"If you've never read Trouble On Cabin Creek, then perhaps you'd enjoy this one because it is so similar. The reader knows from the start that the Red Dog will in some way be presented as faithful, loyal, and brave and at some point come to the rescue. It does present some helpful thoughts for children being raised by step parents or extended family.The portrayal of the step father and son, is well done and gives some good points to ponder."
1,Not appropriate for children--too much violence!,"I began reading this book with my daughters, ages 7 and 9, and soon realized it was a story of lawless men holding a family at knife point and planning to murder them once ""dad"" returns with proof of land ownership----all very frightening for children. My daughter couldn't sleep that night. I threw the book away---I wouldn't even donate it to anyone else given the violent premise.We were so disappointed, given that Bill Wallace has other much more joyous dog stories that we have enjoyed!"
5,Wishing for More,"Singer/instrumentalist Rick Danko melded country and urban soul influences into a unique sound that some of us will always wish for more of. For us, this collection of previously unreleased material was issued some six years after his death. Three tracks here -- the Motownish ""Turn to Stone"" and ""Cry Another Tear"" and the pure-country ""When I Get My Just Rewards"" -- are among the most beautiful vocals he ever recorded and, alone, justify this disc. Given that chronic sobriety issues hampered his career, it is somewhat distressing to hear him so obviously hammered on certain tracks, including the four live tracks that close the album, but it can't be denied that those tracks rock hard."
1,DO NOT USE IN A SPA - MISLEADING,"I purchased this item through amazon and followed the instruction for my 7 person hot tub. When I tested the chlorine level was off the chart even though I had it set at the lowest level and only put 2 tablets in it instead of 6. The spa has so much chlorine in it now that my eyes burn whenever I go near the hot tub. THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK IN SPAS, AND IS A HEALTH RISK IN SUCH USE! Unfortunately I cannot eturn it because it is now considered used."
1,after a few weeks the bottom did not attach securely,Like the product but can't give it a positive review because after a few weeks the top no longer would thread into the bottom. the bottom basket fell into the pool and the chlorine tabs damaged the bottom of my pool. I would avoid.
3,More essays than a book,"What bothered me most about this book was that I was looking for a little more history and little less political philosophy. While Pipes makes some interesting observations and certainly takes a different, and more conservative, viewpoint, he seems more interested in scoring political points than in taking a clean look at this very interesting period. I was hoping to use the essays in the book to teach a high school class on 20th Century History but ultimately found them to require too much of an understanding of the entire scope of the Soviet experience. This book is better for people who grew up during the Cold War, but for anyone under the age of 30 it lacks any real context. Come prepared!"
5,I love this series,Parnell Hall is a fantastic writer. All of his books are craftily written and well developed. The author expertly draws you in until you feel as if you know the characters intimately. This installment of the series is unique in that it shows a side of Clara we haven't seen before - her love life. I highly recommend this series to any mystery book lover!!!
3,Ghosts in hats,"Julie Bernard dreams of being a detective in Australia, and plays at it sometimes with friends, much to the aggravation of her girlfriend Teresa. Struggling with her relationship with Teresa, Julie meets the alluring Fedora on the same night that a young woman in murdered nearby. Julie soon learns that Fedora isn't what she seems. That is, she isn't a person per se. She is a time-travelling spirit, with a connection to Julie's great-grandmother, who has come to help Julie solve the murder, and locate some missing hats. Really. In a non-stop madcap adventure, Julie finds herself in danger, and unwittingly brings the danger home to Teresa. It's a fun read (and I didn't find it ""laugh out loud"" funny as the book description claims), and it will appeal to lovers of mysteries by Claire McNab, Mary Wings, and Barbara Wilson."
3,"A gorgeous, informative book but not applicable to my zone.","This is such a wonderful, beautiful book. Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't apply much because of my hardiness zone. I live in Zone 6 (7 if I stretch it) and I know there are a number of plants that can help me achieve ""the tropical look"" because I am doing it. If only the author had taken it a step further and included more of the plants that I know are out there, just beyond my reach!"
5,Expert Straight pool insights,"This book offers SUPERB insights into crossing 1 or 2 rack limits to breaks in straight pool. From ambitious novice to excellent player, you can learn a LOT by scanning a few pages. Straight pool, more than 8 or 9 ball, is a mental game and Fels does a marvellous and thorough job of explaining it."
4,Kitty fun!,"My cat is a little fussy about toys, but when he has his midnight runs (or crazies) he loves to attack this robin. He tosses it around for the squeak it makes and drags it under furniture for stalking fun."
4,fun but damaged,I never removed the pallet off the tattered box until yesterday. After putting the table together the damage that had come in shipping was apparent. It still plays and is fun but it has a hole it the side. I am sure amazon will be sure I am credited approriately. I never had any problem before. MERRY CHRISTMAS
2,I'm just not diggin it,"I picked this CD up yesterday and to be honest with you I'm just not enjoying it.As a guitar player myself, the whole thing sounds like he just started learning how to play a couple of years ago. The solos aren't fluid, his tone is horrible and most of the licks sound like every other blues CD I've listened to. Maybe it's just me, but after spending hours listening to Joe Bonamassa and Larry Carlton I guess I'm spoiled? I dunno, just sounds like nails on a chalkboard. The CD drags on and has no momentum either. Is one of his other CDs better perhaps that I could listen to?"
5,"Every parent, teacher, and therapist should read!","Exceptional book...I've worked in the educational system for 30+ years...never had so much good information in one book before. This book will open your eyes to ""why"" some kids behave the way do...just well written."
2,Kindle version a mess,"In agreement with the other Kindle version review, i have to say that the electronic version is very poor. There are frequent misspellings and sloppy formatting (repeated sentences, random indentation) that prompted me to return the copy only one chapter in."
2,Are they SERIOUS??,"Gave my daughter this limo for her birthday ... it won't stay together!! ... COMPLETE piece of JUNK .. an expensive piece of junk! ... Save your money and don't even bother .. it's in a million pieces, and the car just plain won't stay together.. doors fall off, trunk falls (my daughter TAPED hers together)..."
2,Hunk of Junk,"I am writing this review in the hopes that I can prevent even one person from spending his/her hard earned money on this toy.I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she was thrilled. She hasn't played with it much, however. It is very cheaply put together. The doors fall of easily, and I have to snap them back on. One of the front seats won't stay upright. The radio and light buttons feel like they will break off anytime. The radio sounds tinny (no big surprise there). It is very heavy and hard to move around without some part of it breaking off. The side mirrors won't stay on (and I was given two mirrors that both go into the same side!)I bought it at the last minute because my daughter wanted it so bad. It is too much money to spend for such a piece of junk."
1,What a piece of JUNK!,"This was the big ticket item my daughter wanted this year. It was a big LOSER!Impossible to remove from the box,impossible to keep the pieces attached. No wonder why there was so many ties on the box, all the pieces would go all over the place, they certainly don't stay attached to the limo. DO NOT WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS EXPENSIVE ITEM.Item is one day old and can't wait to get rid of it already, but it was just too expensive to discard yet!"
2,Still picking up the pieces,"My main complaint is still the pieces falling off. My daughter doesn't drive it into the walls or hey MOVE IT, but yet it still falls apart. She still puts the Bratz dolls in it and has conversations with them but if Dana's shoe hits the door by accident, off goes the door. It still sits by the Disco cause if you remotely look at that thing wrong, it too falls to pieces. I think that the look is cute and the girls like that, but the parents are very sick of picking piece after piece up off of the floor."
2,waste of money,"i bought this limo for my 9yr old daughter. what a piece of junk. the doors, hood, and trunk do not stay on this vehicle. so if your child likes to play with it without any of the intended car parts then go for it. it is way too much money for the lack of durability. i thought barbie was cheap but this limo takes the cake!"
4,We love it!,"My seven year old daughter loves it! She screamed when she removed the wrapping! I was skeptical also when I read some of the reviews and the high price tag was not an incentive (honestly, I purchased at another site which was $30 less), but if you take your time to remove all the wiring and tape and ""snap"" the back doors, side windows, windshield and hood in place, it works perfectly, even the FM radio has good reception. The directions do not indicate this, but some common sense is required."
2,Christmas toy,"My mother bought this toy for my then 5 year old daughter who just had to have it. She absolutely loves the limo and plays with it nonstop despite the fact that the doors are constantly falling off, and the top never stays put. Somehow it doesn't seem to bother her one bit probably because her father and I are forever putting it back together again. For the price that is paid for this limo it ought to at least be put together well enough so that the children can play with it and not have to worry about whether or not the doors are going to stay on. Overall I am not to impressed with this toy."
4,TO MUCH $$$$$$$$$$,"WHAT ON EARTH DOES AMAZON THINK ITS DOING!!! THIS IS WWWWAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY TO MUCH MONEY FOR A CAR!!! IMEAN I KNOW ITS BIG, IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE 80.00 $'ERS. LOWER THE DANG PRICE ALREADY. SHEESH!!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My daughter received this limo for her birthday. I was extremely disappointed. It falls apart. It was made extremely poor. I believe it was purchased for over $80.00. It is not worth $1.00. Do yourself a favor, do not buy it."
1,No Charm This (3rd) Time...,"This is my third Mallory novel, and I thought her character would be easier to handle, but I was wrong. I can't believe that such a hateful person with no redeeming virtues could be the object of unswerving love and loyalty from her intimate circle. If you want to follow a woman character who solves murders and is irresistably quirky AND wonderful, read Sue Grafton's Alphabet series about Kinsey Milhone. You'll be hooked after ""A"" is for Alibi! Kathy Mallory is as big a waste of time and money as I have ever spent. Please give Sue Graftons novels a try. You won't be sorry.Reviewed by: AppleAllen {Georgiana,Alabama}"
1,fake and really nasty smell,i had purchased tis bottle along wit a 3.4oz other one i was thinking i was getting a great deal they both arrived same day but once i sprayed this one i thought maybe u hav2 let it settle but i let over 1hr. 2go by and still gross cheap smell both bottles look authentic but upon closer inspection i noticed sum sort of particles floating jus stick 2spending a lil more for a lil less @walmart or target wherever its sold at least u no you're guaranteed the real thing
2,Didn't learn much,"I bought this book because I thought that building a single application throughout the book would be a good way to learn Java. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The author generally presents a code listing and then explains what it does. That's nice, but I would have liked to have some end-of-chapter exercises so that I could have applied what was covered in the chapter. There were also some omissions in the code starting in Chapter 8, which kept the class from being able to compile correctly.While this book may appeal to those that can pick up the nuances of a programming language by just reading code, those of us who learn by doing would be better off looking elsewhere."
3,A great starting point...but that's it.,"Buy a used copy of Bear's Guide, as this edition is really justa re-hashing of earlier versions. Nevertheless, Bear's Guide isprobably the only comprehensive source of distance education info onthe market. It is a great starting point for anyone really interested in pursuing distance education. I would point to three areas of concern, however. First, distance education is much cheaper than the traditional format: You get what you pay for...no matter the medium. Bear's Guide touches on this only slightly. Second, Mr. Bear(a pseudonym), has quite a large following of rabid, unquestioning groupies who tend to ""circle the wagons"" any time Mr. Bear is publically challenged. Most reviews of this book, at this site, are written by these groupies...Finally, with Mr. Bear's growing popularity and entourage, I would say the quality of Bear's Guide has been slipping. This current edition is merely a re-hashing of his last."
4,"""Quatro"" is near perfect!","Ska never has had a big following in the US. Which is a shame because it's a fun, laid-back style of music to listen to. And while ""Quatro"" is not entirely a pure ska album, it's influences are clearly there, especially in the opening song, ""Dancin' Queen"", as well as in ""Save Yourself"" and ""Hey Hey Hi"". Other songs I liked were ""Old School Master"" and ""Coffee Girl"" Even if you've never heard of Johnny Socko, chances are you soon will. Listen to the samples provided and decide for yourself. I think you'll agree that ""Quatro"" is ""muy bueno"""
5,Rules,"I like this sitcom, I wish it were still on. I received it fast and in great shape. Good show."
1,Flimsy construction,"We would like to send this item back. The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome. One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled. The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble."
2,Poorly packaged.,"Overall an ok product. It is poorly packed with almost nothing holding its 110 lbs of slick pressed wood from pounding against itself. I had to return the first one due to numerous corners being smashed and the sticker ""paint"" job being torn in many places. The second one was a little better in that I was able to touch up most of the damage, but not all of it. This could also be due to the poor shipping services of the damage masters/late delivers at UPS. What was actually painted had runs in the paint. Once again, needed touch up. The round balls are lopsided which does add a new level of challenge to the game. The game does work, however, and if you don't mind the dent and dings..."
1,is there a zero rating?,"Hard to assemble, crappy once you do. This item never worked and I had to pay someone to remove it from my house since it's so big"
2,Too much upkeep!,"We have this game in a pediatric office. I know that it is not intended for daily use, but the darn thing breaks all the time. The bottom line:1. The assembly is a nightmare.2. The pieces are made of pressboard and will break if any weight is put on them.3. The balls get stuck for no other reason than poor product design.4. I could go on and on.We've had to maintain the device (e.g. went to the lumber yard to replace some of the pressboard with wood). It's fun, but there are A MILLION things wrong with it."
2,"Slow starting, somewhat dated.","I couldn't finish this book. It took about 80 pages to be able to get my head around what was happening, but either because of that or for other reasons, I didn't care about anyone in the story. An interesting premise, and piqued my interest about Chaim Weizmann."
2,great until it stops working,"The kids bought this fridge for my husband to use in his office. It worked for about a month and then stopped working. Thankfully, it was still under warranty and we were able to get a new one. Unfortunately the second one only worked for about a year and then died."
1,Not reliable,"The fridge lasted about 6 or 7 months before failing (which is pretty long compared to some of the other reviews). I used it just to keep drinks cold in my bedroom. Eventually, the fridge would only go hot even when switched on cold.Not a reliable product."
5,So Far So Good as Bedroom Pop Cooler,"I read all the reviews for this fridge and other like it. This one seemed the best out of all the ones available. however, I'm a little worried because some people said it breaks after 3 months. I got it as a present for my nephew who uses it solely to keep pop cool in his bedroom.It seems to be working well for that. I think the most important thing to remember is that it has to have air space around it for the fan to vent the warm air out."
3,Lacking,"I personally like the Glossary written by Robert Perry, it is so much more informative and easier to understand for this old man."
5,"great seller, wonderful book","The transaction was perfect from start to finish. The glossary is a huge help to me, in my attempt to get more out of A Course in Miracles. So happy to find a new, hard cover copy. Seller is excellent"
