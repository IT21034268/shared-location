1,hard to read,"This book is horribly difficult to read, it is very terse. I found that I could easily follow the things I knew already, but it is not a good book to learn new things from. It is a collection of research results, in a sensible order, but little effort has been made to explain things to the novice. In fact there are research papers which introduce more advanced topics than covered here, and are much easier to read than this book (for example Alur's paper on ATL). It is probably good as a comprehensive reference if you are already familiar with the techniques. It is a shame as there seems to be no other comprehensive book available on model checking. The most accessible introduction remains Manna and Pnueli's ""Temporal Verification of Reactive Systems"", although it only has one chapter on model checking."
4,Blood Leaches,"Oh boy. Where do I begin with this movie? I first saw it when I was 11. Then I saw it a second time last summer, when I was in a wheelchair.Certain images of the movie have been stuck on my mind for years, and some of the things that were said in the movie are still stuck on my mind. I still can't look at beaches without a certain image in my mind. I can't say what that is. If you haven't seen this movie, I won't spoil it for ya."
1,Forget about it. . . . . .,"Certainly up there in the top ten of worst movies ever made. Fact is, it's just plain stupid and I'm surprised that it's still available."
4,Sammy's Science House,"My children especially enjoy making their own movies, which is actually a program that teaches them sequencing. They also enjoy putting together the different pictures using the assortment of shapes given."
3,Unconvincing,"Managed to fit a 60-minute subject into a 90-minute running time. Which is even more impressive considering how it only showed one side of the situation. Still, it's worth taking a look at. The art is pretty."
4,Four and a half. Four and three quarters.,"This is *so close* to being five stars. I like his simpler, less-produced albums better, both the earlier and later ones (so maybe this is more a matter of taste?). But there are a lot of really good tracks on here in between the overuse of synthesizers and backup singing."
5,"Involving, creative, exciting...","My husband and I both read this book of shorts. It was really well written, and neither of us have forgotten it.I wish we still had it! But we traded it while in Cambodia at a hostel. *sigh*Highly recommend T.C. Boyle. This collection especially."
5,God's Will isn't as elusive as I once thought,"This book is very short and to the point. I love how MacArthur continually upholds Scripture as the starting and ending place for all things. This book is a continual testimony of how God's Word is the ultimate and only authority for all of life. By reading this book, I now understand that God outlines His Will very clearly in Scripture, and I don't have to look for a ""peace"" from Him. In fact, doing so is unbiblical! I found, through this book, Scriputre has an answer for ANYTHING I might need, and as I am in God's Word more and more every day, I continually find this to be true. I would recommend this book to all Christians to buy and read and give to all their friends."
1,Not My Cuppa Tea,"This book was boring!!! Well, thats, my humble, ordinary opinion. Three stories, three different authors, yet exactly the same - DULL. I managed to complete the first story, skipping a lot of the pages to do so. I tried the second and third stories as I realised they were written by different authors. Couldn't finish either of them. I tried hard to like and enjoy but couldn't. I like story lines with a bit of fun and keep the ""hot and steamy stuff"" out of it. Hot and steamy needs to be written quickly, fast paced and keep it short, not pages and pages. Maybe I'm ""square"" but I just don't like these types."
2,"HARD TO START, EVENTUALLY FELL APART",WE FOUGHT IT FOR 8 MONTHS AND THEN IT BROKE. FROM THE START IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THE CAN STARTED. IT HAS TO BE HELD JUST SO. WIFE NEVER WAS ABLE TO OPERATE.AFTER 6 MONTHS THE MAGNET WENT OUT WITH A LID THEN THE MECHANISM BROKE ABOUT A MONTH LATER. THE KNIFE SHARPENER ON THE BACK WAS USELESS. LOOKED NICE AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT BUT WILL PAY MORE FOR A HOPEFULLY BETTER RESULT
1,Horrible dispenser,"I have recently become arthritic in my hands so I ordered this can opener. It is awful. I have been successful with exactly one can. I just tried several times to open my cat's food, but it just won't catch. I don't ever remember can openers being so difficult. What happened? Design over function?"
2,cheap looking,the can opener works fine. my only complaint is that is looks so cheap. i thought the front would be metal-it's not. it cheap gray plastic. wish i would have know that before i purchased it.
5,Very good opener.,"The Oster Metallic Can Opener is efficient and quiet. It also looks good on the counter. I like not having to keep my hand on the lever while opening, just start it and it will stop automatically and the magnet will grab the lid. An opener that does what it says it will do!"
1,They used to know how to make can openers,"They knew how to make electric can openers in the 1950s. They were simple, easy to use, and reliable. Perhaps Oster should find one of the old ones and reverse-engineer it.This one looks great on the counter, it has a nice retractible cord, and it's easy to keep clean, -it just doesn't open most cans.If you buy this one, be sure to pick up a hand-crank model to keep in the drawer in case you really need to actually open a can someday."
4,Great little MP3 player,I really like this MP3 player overall. It doesn't hold a lot for those that want to puit multiple albums on their player but for me it was plenty. It does seem a little confusing to operate but I am getting the hang of it.
2,ginsu notso,Didn't like anything about this set. The knife edges were very irregular and not honed very well..just not what i expected.
2,Don't get serrated,"Serrated knives are the lazy man's choice in knives. I bought this Ginsu set right after college and have struggled to cut almost everything after the first month. These cannot be sharpened without a special sharpener that costs as much as the block.Upon some research, I realized that Ginsu knives have low quality steel, and that real German and Japanese knives have much harder steel. I decided to invest an extra fifty dollars in a good set with smooth edges, and have never regretted it. Imagine only needing one cut through thick steaks, honing that only happens once a month, and shaprening that only happens once a year.The first review was obiviously written by a Ginsu company rep. How anyone can love these knives after trying a good set is beyond me."
5,EXTREMELY sharp!,"Works so great that while using to cut an avocado, the knife slipped and went right through my finger. Good news is that because the knife was so sharp, it didn't mangle too much. Strange review, I know...but these have to be the sharpest knives I've ever used. Just use with caution! :)"
3,A big let down!,"I was so excited to get some nice knives, but the excitement ended immediately after I opened the product. The knives seemed nice enough, but they did not fit in the wood block! I tried to switch them around because I thought I was doing something wrong. After unpacking everything, I had to pack it back up and return it. I was completely bummed out and decided to order a different brand of knives -ChicagoCutlery Fusion 18-Piece Set including Honey Maple Wood Block. I wouldn't buy these knives or this brand again. Disappointed!"
2,Not Quite The Quality I Had Hoped For...,"I only tried 3 of the knives in this set, but they didn't seem super sharp. I had to use plenty of pressure to get the job done. But what bothered me even more was the block. Firstly, the block that came wasn't the same block that was pictured in Amazon's ad description. Secondly, the block I did receive was designed in such a way that the weight balance was in the front of the block rather than the rear, allowing it to tip forward easily, thus spilling out all the knives. I gave it two stars only because it was attractive in appearance at an inexpensive price. But I was hoping for better functionality. I sent the knife set back to Amazon, and they were great about returning my money."
4,Chop Chop Crappy Block,"I looked at a lot of reviews before buying knives. In no way am I a professional cook but I needed something to do the job. I ended up getting these and so far the knives are great, they work well and look great. My only complaint is about the block, the slots are a little slopping and don't hold the knives all that great.I'd definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a great knife set at a great price."
1,DON'T,"This is a joke, false advertisement on the part of the manufacturer. These knives were so dull I couldn't even cut my finger. I immediately packed them up and sent them back to Amazon and was given a full refund. Save your time and money on this one."
4,Knives,I bought it for my mom.She LOVES them. SHe said they really sharp and really nice looking too!
4,GREAT SET!!!!,I have had this a few weeks and have used almost every knife. I like to cook and have found these to be amazing. The quality is what you would expect. I especially like the chefs knife. The stainless steels looks sleek and hand washing is recommended. Worth the money!
5,GOOD AS ADVERTISED,"My wife is very happy with these knives, so I am happy with them. The transaction between the seller and myself went well. Would buy from this seller again."
4,Good Knives,"These knives are very sharp and heavy, which I like. My package arrived without the scissors included. Since I bought this for the knives, and not the scissors, I simply called Amazon.com, and they gave me a small reimbursement - which was great by me! Good buy...we'll see how they hold up in the long run. I try not to put them in the dishwasher, but that doesn't always happen."
4,WORTH THE MONEY,"FOR THE PRICE WE PAID THESE KNIVES ARE GREAT,,,,ITS ONLY BEEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS THOUGH :-)"
2,very sharp for only few months,"I have used this knife set for almost 3 year. They were very sharp in the first few months. After a while, I don't think it is good. You can still cut things with them but if I try to cut tomatoes, they will not be in a good shape. Serrated knives give you fake sharp feeling and you cannot sharpen it by yourself. The only one still useful for me is the Santoku. I need to buy another sharpener though."
5,Best $40.00 Purchase in a long time.,"Fabulous look and product for the price. Would have gladly paid more. I think everyone should have a set, perfectly crafted tools for your cooking experiences!"
4,Good Set,Cheap set that feels nice and weighty in your hand and cuts well. The scissors arent very good quality but Im very pleased with the purchase.
3,Chipping paint,"The paint on the block began chipping off almost immediately. The knives themselves are solid and nice, we got a couple of spots when first placed in the dishwasher, but have continued doing so and they haven't gotten worse."
1,Okay.,"When I first got this knife set, I really liked it. Now I've had it for about 6 months and it is just average. The knife slots aren't great and sometimes I end up cutting/slicing some of the wood inside. Additionally, some of the knifes have become discolored or rusted after many washes"
5,"I loved it as a kid, I love it now",Quick delivery. Good shape and seems to be all together. Can't wait to play the game with my seven year old son.
5,Correct battery/wrong color,"This battery is exactly what I needed to repalce my old one. However, the website shows the color as grey, when in fact it is white. It still does the job, it just doesn't match the color of the dvd player it is attached to."
3,"strong binder, but strong enough?","I use binders all the time for work as a dance accompanist. A good binder holds my sheet music, and I must access it countless times a week.I purchased Avery Binders because I believe they are strong and durable for the long haul, but I must say that this one hasn't lived up to it's worth. One of the rings has started to not close properly.The pockets are great, and the plastic is strong, but the actual ring mechanism needs to be stronger"
4,Great companion book to the Ellis/Millar Authority series,"What events transpired in the time between StormWatch's disbandment and the formation of the Authority? Jenny Sparks: The Secret History Of The Authority answers that question and shed some light on the untold tales of the superhero team formally known as StormWatch.As he did so well on the The Authority series, Mark Millar's sarcastic dialogue is hilariously dark and witty. John McCrea's artwork was a pleasant surprise. His equivocal and caricature-esque style on Hitman has kept me away from that series but he demonstrates with this book that he can also pencil in a realistic and polished manner.In the end, this collected edition is a must for Authority fans and represents a great starting point for new readers who are unfamiliar with The Authority. Check it out.Review by Brian Grindrod"
4,Good Memories,"Ah yes, the old Paisley Underground sound of the early 80s. That was a fun time, and bands like True West, Green on Red, Three O'Clock (or Salvation Army), and even Rain Parade put out some great music. You will find some excellent tunes on this True West compilation. As pointed out by another reviewer, their first EP was quite psychedelic sounding for the most part. On some tracks the fuzzy guitars remind me of the great raw garage rock bands of the 60s. True West cleaned things up a bit with their first full album (included here) but the music was still very, very interesting. Some real killer cuts on this collection by a band that never got its proper kudos."
3,Best of Jessica's hit singles!,"This is her best single of all! Considering I don't generally like this type of music very much, I guess I could say this is a very good song. I just find it has a very catchy tune compared to many other pop songs. But this is still not the kind of song I would normally go out of my way to listen to!"
5,This is a great book for young readers.,Herbie Jones is an awesome book. Herbie Jones is about a kid and how he is. He is brave because he snuck off and got a hamburger. Herbie is funny because he is trying to get on honor roll. At the beginning he got a 100 on his spelling test. Raymond bought Mrs. Pinkham a purple magic marker because he likes her as a teacher. At the end of the book Herbie's sister killed his pet spiders because she was cleaning the house. Herbie's mom got a new job. You should try reading this book.
5,Classic Knopfler Soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack,from a man who is clearly on top of his game,i have not seen the movie yet,but that is what's so good about this,and many of MK's soundtracks,you don't always need to see the film,that is because Mark is a master of atmosphere,he can make you think in your mind of the scotish highlands(Local Hero),France in the 60's(Metroland)or New York(Last exit..)the main theme is just amazing,it sum's up all that is good about MK,such gorgeous playing,it brought tears to my eyes when i first heard it.Can't wait for more from MK"
1,Bad Product,"According to Canon, the metal casing on the SD110 is flawed, and is categorized as a ""known issue."" However, they don't tell you this until you call and complain about it. My camera began developing black spots on the casing as a result of storing it in a Canon leather case (PSC-50). Canon claims that they do not produce the case, even though Amazon's page says otherwise. They will attempt to fix your camera, although it is still unclear what they will do."
2,Good Canon point and shoot - Pain Defect! Embarrassing to carry!,"As many others have already pointed out, this camera (SD110) has a paint defect! The US Canon web site acknowledges the issue and says it's ""extremely rare"". That seems inaccurate because I have 2 friends who have the same camera and they also told me that the paint on the body started to wear away after the first month of usage!One friend did send hers in and got new (darker) paint on it.I'm planning to send mine in as well but can't right now because I'm in Korea!Beware! This camera has a paint defect! After the first few months of usage, it will look like it's been in use for several years! And it will be embarrassing to be seen with it as people judge your character based on how you've taken care of the camera!In general, takes good pictures. But I've seen better outdoor shots on my previous Kodak models. If you have the money, get the Canon SD400! Awesome camera with great clean images!"
1,Not a good value for the price.,"1. Memory sold with the camera is only 16M( 8 shorts of high resolution). You'll have to spend extra $40 to get 512M, so you can use all features you paid in that camera( video, and 2048x1536 resolution ).2. You'll need an extra battery, since Canon will just tell you - ""Cnange battery"" and shut the camera. Their recharge warning will not warn you agead of time. ( Add extra $40 for extra battery ).3. You'll need, an AC adaptor, when uploading or connecting camera to TV ( add another $40 ).So, the price of the camera will have to be 50% more or extra $120, or you get a car without gas and a spair."
1,skip this one,"1. hard to hold.2. not easy to operatewhen you go out with this camera, bring your user manual with you.3. software is not user friendly. also cause lot of resources4. The small battery even doesn't hold enough power to finish the 32M disk. Canon wants to sell batteries to you.5. picture quality is not better than other cameras within same price range.6. small and slow lens"
2,Great Pictures....BUT,"I loved my digital elph when I first purchased it even though it had a dead pixel. It came the day before I was to leave for vacation for 4 months so I didn't have the time to send it back. It takes great pictures I do have to say, but after a year the body of the camera looks like it's been through a tornado. I take good care of my gadgets and it has its own case and everything, so I guess I don't understand why it looks so awful. The silvery body as turned almost yellow, and has little and BIG black and grey spots all over it. I'm almost ashamed to let anyone use it to take a picture. Canon makes great products I don't understand why this one is so under standards."
3,"Nice picture quality, but.....","The picture quality from this camera is great. It is sharp and clear. But, I have been disapointed by a couple of things.A) The LCD screen is very small and dark and it is hard to tell the quality of the picture you have taken until it is actually on the computer.B) The flash is so bright that if you take any kind of close up of someone they turn out all washed out in the picture. When I use the manual function and turn off the flash, it is hard to get a clear picture even if there is enough lighting. For some reason the pictures turn out blurry most of the time.C) The picture speed is VERY, VERY slow. I tried to take pictures of my 6 year old sledding with no luck. It was so slow and delayed that even if she was going slow, I would end up with a picture of just the snow.Other than those things, which are pretty important to me, the camera takes nice pictures as long as the object is not moving and is far enough away so that it doesn't get washed out by the flash."
4,"Great price, perfect size, great photos","Its exactly the same size as a pack of cigs. Perfect for carrying in your pocket for nights out and activities which would make you leave your larger SLR at home. Quality of pics is more than good enough and the size/quality is easily customizable. For the price its everything you could hope for in a camera, and you'd need to be a really good photographer to make a more expensive model worth the outlay."
5,gotta have it!,"I just love this camera! It's small, easy to use, and it takes fantastic pictures. At the price amazon is offering it, you literally can't afford NOT to buy it. I have friends with similar versions of this camera and they swear by it as well.Memory cards are really cheap right now-I personally bought a 128mb, which in my opinion is plenty (will hold over 100 pictures.) I also bought the leather case and it fits the camera snugly. Others have complained that it's TOO small because it won't hold anything else (extra cards, batteries, etc.) but why purchase a small camera if you're going to carry it around in a giant bag with a bunch of stuff? This case is good to have to protect it from being damaged in whatever bag/pocket you carry the camera around in...and it too is cheap."
4,A Romanian girl,I always loved gipsy music and unfortunately it's not easy to come by a good recording. This is true Romanian gipsy music it's almost funny to listen to the gipsy accent but the recoding is not that great.
4,"Good product, and good value.","This was fairly easy to install, however you must have access to the space from an attic to do it easily. Well built and easy to assemble. It is very quiet, and does a good job. The slightly bowed light diffuser allows the light to be spread over the bathroom very well. Subject to the installation issue, I recommend this unit."
4,Sound advice for an important choice for many parents.,"This is The Book for parents who want to be as sure as possible that they hire the right person to care for their child. Fran Hernan, a professional nanny herself, offers sound advice for making one of the most important choices many parents have to make"
2,Very Disappointing,"After reading September and Coming Home, this was a real letdown. The characters were not well enough defined to show the motivation for their behavior. I never believed anything they said or did. It read, to me, like a Reader's Digest version of what she could have written. This won't discourage me, however, from continuing to explore her books, as the others were most enjoyable."
1,Extremely poor quality,"This ""book"" is of such poor quality that reading it from front cover to the footnotes is more challenging than the thought of consuming the flesh of fellow travelers in the mountains. It doesn't even include an ISBN for inclusion in the Library of Congress. The ASCII font was the first tip-off that the reader was indeed trapped in the Donner Pass of literature. The only tragedy was the money we lost by buying this book."
4,recording made simple,"i'm not an audiophile or recording engineer,so simplicity is very important to me. and this recorder fits the bill perfectly. so far iam totally happy with the way it performs. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i haven't had it or used it long enough to rate it's dependability, which is also important to me."
2,Did not like this: very poor quality,Bought this DVD to deepen my knowledge and improve my technique as a Cerified Massage Therapist and a graduatee in Massage Therapy at College.Was greatly disappointed with the material presented in this DVD and its poor quality. It looks more like a home made video than a serious hands-on visual manual.
4,Good for the ones who know java,"I bought this book and I will recommend it just if You know java very good, and what to learn just what is new on java 5.The good thing about it is that you do not have to jump from stuff that you already know. the bad thing about it is that it can be out of the context.I bought this book while working on a site I was building (...) and wishing to write it on java 1.5, and not 1.4. The truth - In the end I wrote it on JDK 1.5 but with any new feature of java 5.Old habits are hard to change.Another thing that disturbed me with the book are the headlines, which are all the same in the book, and not subject dependent.Other than this, this book is very good, and I recommend it."
2,shallow,"I found the book shallow. Probably Notebook series is meant to be that way, a quick overview of a subject. What a programmer needs is developing intuition in the tool it uses. If you need a quick tour of Tiger this book is good but, http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html, I beleive is good enough for this purpose. Especially the tutorial on generics far beyond better than what this book covers. You can find it at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/pdf/generics-tutorial.pdf"
4,Rachmaninov: Piano Works,Rachmaninov: Piano Works is a 1991 Naxos recording starring pianist Idil Biret. Keith Anderson has written the music notes. A quite enjoyable recording. Recommended. 4/5.
5,The first album that glued me to the stereo!,"I remember when my father bought this album on cassette when it first came out. He ended up buying another copy because I literally wore it out on him! I used to listen to this everyday for like 3 years. ""Bring on the Night"" ranks in at #1 on ""my favorite live albums"" list! Like Sting's solo stuff on here, I also dug the new twists on some of ""The Police"" tracks! I've had this on CD for years now and still enjoy it immensely! Another good friend of mine begged me to let her borrow it and I finally gave in. She says that it's now one of her favorites too. So you now heard it from me; we enjoy it, I know you will too."
4,the truth behind the taboo,"Carole Anne has the dignity and the courage to explore chilling cases of children who murdered others.Every aspect of these children's life is explore in order to better understand the connection between child abuse and murder.As a criminologist, I think that this book lacks two important things. First, it does not explain why a lot of children who suffered abuse didn't turn to be murderers. Second,a summary that connects between theory and the cases explored in the book, would add a better understanding of the cases.Prof, Arnon Edelstein, Criminologist"
1,Piece of Crap,"This is a total waste of money. The comb comes with no instructions, and pieces that seem to go nowhere. It is too tiny to fit a regular size blowdryer. What a rip off."
1,churchill finlandia china,"Unforunately this china from Columbia is a poor copy of the original. Looks more like ""seconds"". Would not recommend."
5,Wish Id read this book years ago,"Fantastic book, I bought another copy to send to my best friend who was like me aBritish War Bride, I only wishI had know of the survays being done at that time, I would have loved to have participated in its information,"
2,Nothing too special here,"Criminal was a good little independant film with a couple of con men doing a job. The plot twists and turns are slightly predictable, though I have to admit that I didn't forsee the ending. Well, not exactly how it ended. I saw some aspects of it coming, but not all of it.There are basically no special features on this disc. So if you pick it up or rent it, don't expect any behind-the-scenes info. You're getting nothing more than the movie itself.Nothing too special here. A decent rental, but don't bother purchasing it. You're better off with something of more substance."
1,WORST WESTERN EVER !!!,"To use the name of Val Kilmer to draw the viewers to this film is a total con job.VAL KILMER PLAYS A ""DEAD"" CORPSE AND DOESN'T UTTER A SINGLE SYLLABLE IN THE ENTIRE FILM. HE COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY REPLACED WITH A 100 LBS SACK OF FLOUR ... FOR THE SAME EFFECT VALUE.WHAT A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY. BEWARE TO ALL BUYERS. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF ****!!"
3,Effort to make a different western,"Val Kilmer plays the dead man: the bounty on the wrong manis to be paid for a drunken Sheriff and a bar maid, his Civil war bride.All sorrow and blood for bounty.A very black western that comes just short of an horror movie.More blood and severed heads than I would ever like to seeagain. We have no sympathy left for anyone by the happy ending."
1,The Worst Movie I've Even Seen Hands Down,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life... do I need to say anything more? Val Kilmer must really be desperate for cash!
5,ABOUT ((%(%((#%@$%(@%@$#-ing TIME!!!!!,It is surely a sign that the end of the world MUST be looming now that these are FINALLY being released!!! I had just about given up hope. Let us all hope that the assured success of this first installment will result in the rest of the episodes being released in a timely manner. WE HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH ALREADY SO DO NOT TEASE US!! Now if only someone would get off their similarly lazy asses at Paramount(i think) and get DUCKMAN released. Probably have to wait for hell to freeze over but now there is at least something to watch in the interim.
3,Fan favorites,"I bought Hogan's Heroes Fan Favorites for my husband. He said they were not his favorites and there were so few episodes,He was very disappointed. I have since then through Amazon bought him 3 full seasons. He is very happy with them and it is worth the extra money, which is still a good deal, to get a full season. You won't be disappointed."
3,Great sound but...,"I'm writing this review because my case doesn't seem to be the norm. I bought these a while back and probably paid something like $10 for them so it was worth the try. The sound was impressive! They're not a Bose or Sennheiser, but hey they're $10. However, there is an important problem to note...they weigh half a pound!! While that might not seem like much, it becomes a lot after extended use. I think you can say my ears are medium to small and the headphones still press on them quite a bit. Beyond mere discomfort, these actually hurt! So, if they fit you that's great and you'll be getting a good deal. If it's just sound you want without paying a lot, go with these above all the other low-priced headphones! But if you want a 5 ounce lightweight item of comfort for long periods of time, you've gotta go with Bose."
3,Not as good as the older model,"I ordered these headphones to replace a pair I bought (same brand, same model) a few years ago. I LOVED the older headphones, but the new ones don't feel as good. The material they're made from feels cheaper and they don't fit as well. One feature of the older model I really liked was that the cord was only on one side of the headphones, but on the new model, the cord is attached to both ear pieces. The sound is good, but the fit could be better..."
2,Oh Hum,"I am glad I never paid for this game. Great thing was I installed the game, I have never needed the disk again. Woohoo, so brother-in-law gets his game back and a sorry you wasted your money. I only knew of one cheat code. (enter,type sleepworker, then hit m-key) The money code. 10,000 a pop not bad. hated having to hit ctrl key to change camera angle with mouse. BLAH. Name sounded cool, graphics not to bad, loved being able to pick up one of the fighting inmates and drop somewhere else, kept my fighting at 0 for a few years until I got to many inmates to watch them all. If it was not for money cheat you run out of money an can never recover once you have a few things in place. Oh well, like I said I did not waste money on it. ;-)"
1,The creators of this game should be doing some time.,"Wow...That's the last time I purchase a game before reading the Amazon reviews. They are mostly dead on.It's a really interesting and out of the ordinary concept. I couldn't wait to install it. Now I weep for my wasted 10 bucks. Wjile the graphics are only ""ok""..the game really falls into the abyss when it comes to gameplay. You could spend hours waiting for anything to happen. There also isn't enough room to work with as far as building your prison. It just all around sucks.If there was a ""Watching Paint Dry Tycoon""....it would be more exciting than this."
4,works great,this product worked fine. it bounces around a little but that has to be expected for a product like this. would recommend it to others. Very easy to setup.
3,Travel Case,I like this case. It is nice in order to attach to the seat or in the middle of two seats when traveling. It holds the player and the attachments and some DVD's. The only bad thing is that it doesn't hold a lot of DVD/CD's so you still need a seperate case for that. But this is a much sturdier case then some of the others I have looked at.
4,Best solution I found for DVD watching while rear facing.,My toddler is still seating rear facing in his car seat and we wanted him to have a DVD player in the car for a long road trip. This was the best solution we found. We were able to hang it from the headrest right above the seat where the car seat is placed. The case rested on his legs a little bit and he was definitely able to touch the DVD player (which are my two cons when using this product). I sat right next to him while using the DVD player to make sure he wouldn't kick it or touch it. Overall it served the purpose.
4,Good for travelling,"A good quality product. The only issue we had was that the clip fastening the straps snapped off, so we had to ask for another one."
2,Doesn't fit my car well,Purchased this for my son to use in the car during long trips. The straps don't pull the carrier high enough and thus it would be sitting in my son's lap during use. Maybe its not meant for our type of car (Honda Fit). Am returning.
1,Nothing spectacular,"Followed the directions on the product.... nothing. Tried it again, after reading.... nothing. Didn't clean the grill as shown in the commercials or on the product packaging. Contacted the company, nice people but there didn't seem to be a solution. Just not cutting it."
1,Not worth the battle,"The headaches in trying to install the software were simply not worth it. I ended up at Creative's website and found that it was not just me - apparently compatibility was a common problem. After wasting several hours trying different drivers and other suggested fixes, I gave up and sent the Zen back. I replaced it with an IRiver that was much simpler for a casual user. The IRiver certainly has its limitations as it seems to be entirely dependent on Windows, but it works great."
3,Customer support for item is not good,Very pleased with player easy to use small and light. I used it for 8 months every day. It stated to act funny shutting off at will. I contacted customer support who suggested I down load new firmware and drivers. The driver loaded to my pc ok but the firmware crashed the player. It won't switch on at all. It has to be sent back. It is impossible to contact anyone in customer support. All I get automated responses directing to load new firmware which crashed it begin with. If your unit works-great! But your are on your own if it does not. I will try an i-pod next
4,Its Great!,"I think this Mp3 player is great! I can have up to 250 songs, that is enough for me! The only thing I hate are the headphones when you get it I would suggest that you get different headphones. I still have the old ones it came with and I think I should really get different ones!!!"
1,Zen Nano dies yet again,My first nano(black) and replacement(under warranty) nano(black) have both failed. After the duracell provided battery was used up and I replaced it the unit shuts off after about two seconds. I followed the instructions the first time to replace the firm ware via download but it didn't work and just erased all my music. Creative Zen technical support was not very helpful and only repeated the exact same instructions that were on their web. After a series of calls they finally agreed to replace the unit. Well here we go again the exact same problem has now happened with the replacement nano shutting off after two seconds. Stayed tuned...Too bad -- I did enjoy it when it was working. My husband has a blue nano and has not had any problems so I wonder if the black nanos are defective?
4,Excellent product!!!,"This MP3 player is rich in features. It has FM tuner, recorder and MP3 playback. You can also record songs from other sources. It also has a arm band to use it while you workout. The FM radio has a decent sound. The voice recorder is average. The recordings are not very clear and they are stored in WAV file format which takes up a lot of space. The MP3 sound quality is good, but not with the supplied headphones. I use my Philips noise canceling headphone and with that the sound quality is really good. You can adjust the equalizer (4-band) or use the preset. The supplied software is good to transfer & organize your music. The battery can be detached. This unit also can be used as a USB drive to move files between computers.Overall this product is value for money. I would strongly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for value."
5,Wild Zen,"The Zen has lots of memory, a good battery life, is small and easy to use. The radio is good too."
4,Zen Nano Plus MP3 Player review,"I like this product. Even thoguh the recording function is very good quality, it is very good in over all, wspecially at this price."
1,"Buy something cheap, get something cheap...","What a piece of junk! After four hours of messing with this thing and at least that many system recoveries, mine is repackaged and ready for return. The ""simple"" drag and drop loading of this turd has locked my computer up more times than I care to recount. The one time I was able to get more than 20 songs onto the thing without having to CTRL + ALT + DEL and start over from scratch, the player itself locked up! I consider myself to be fairly computer literate, but this thing made me feel like a complete and total idiot. I'm so disgusted right now, I'm not even going to waste my time with Creative Labs' customer support (which, by the way, is only open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday). Save yourself the time, trouble and headache and buy something else -- anything else. Aaaaaarrrrrgh!"
2,Meh,"The lady and I didn't really enjoy these. Also we had two break on us, so yeah, won't be buying these ever again."
3,not cool man....,These things hurt man.. they will really strangle you but it won't ruin your fun if your man enough! I am not sure why some people feel that this concom is bigger than a magnum.. i guess i kinda screwed myself on that one.
5,"Usable, sensible, indispensable!","Unlike most books on investing and personal finance, which breathlessly offer the ""secrets"" of how to get rich quick, this book tells us the honest truth: It doesn't really matter very much which investments you pick unless you know how to control your own fear and greed. The only real key to investment success is self-control! Belsky & Gilovich don't offer a list of ""best investments""--and that's a good thing, too, since all those lists are useless anyway. Instead they show how, by understanding and attacking your own limitations, you can combat your own mental shortcomings as an investor. They show us all how we can take simple, sensible steps to get rich slowly--the only way, after all, that it's even possible to get rich. You can learn more by reading this terrific book than you could learn by memorizing 49 wheelbarrows full of all the so-called investment books out there. It's great!"
1,Just not worth it,"Possibly the worst book I have read in my life. Do yourself a favour and do not buy this book. It holds no interest whatsoever. The characters are so flimsy, the story so boring, and the writing so bad that I couldn't care less what happened to them. I had to force myself to finish it. Even by ""chick lit"" and ""easy reading"" standards it is very poor. I would give it no stars at all if I could."
5,McKettrick's Choice,"When I read of Holt McKettrick in the first 3 books of this series I didn't like him at all. But, after reading this book, he is now my favorite McKettrick! My favorite book in the series. LOVED it!"
4,Great end to a series I really did enjoy.,"Challenges: Read for FunOverall Rating: 4.50Story Rating: 4.50Character Rating: 4.50First thought when finished: Great end to a series I really did enjoy.What I Loved: I loved Holt! Granted I have loved Holt the entire time but it was nice seeing him come full circle. I loved that Rafe was redeemed in this book (in my eyes). I felt he finally accepted Holt and he was one of the family. I loved the romance, the setting, and just about everything in this story.What I Liked/Wished there was a little more of: Holt's daughter (Lizzie) was sadly missing in this story. Though I understand it because of the nature of what he had to do, I missed her! She is such a mini-Holt it isn't even funny! Though I heard that she is part of the Christmas Brides book so I will have to read that.Final Thought: Sad to see the 4 brothers stories come to an end but it was a perfect ending."
4,A FUN HISTORICAL ROMANCE,"This is a book that sweeps you off your feet from the first page. Lorelei Fellows is a strong willed, defiant, stubborn woman and Holt McKettrick happens to have very similar qualities. The hero and heroine are a perfect match for one another and because there is so much tension between them, it makes those softer moments even more tender.The story in itself is very interesting from cattle drive to the Comanches attacks to the way women live on the trail. All the characters are intriguing and very likeable (except for the bad guys, of course!).It's a great story to read all on its own. Happy Reading."
3,nothing special,"I love this author but this book fell short. It just seemed to drag and drag. I finally stopped reading it about 3/4 of the way through it. sorry, LLM........"
3,Different Opinion,"Maybe it's me, but I couldn't even finish this book completely. Loralie got on my nerves from the start. She was too stubborn and cold, so much so that she got to be a bit mean to Holt. I felt like there were times when she was just pushing him away. Yet, he kept coming back. And she kept shoving him away. He got mad, they were both mad, but somehow they fell in love.I thought it was a funny and cute story though. But I just wanted to point out Loralie's kind of in-your-face attitude. I mean, it wasn't terrible. But I felt like Holt didn't do anything to deserve it."
3,Great but pillowcases too small for Queen,"The sheets are very comfortable, and after several washings there is no sign of piling. However, the pillow cases are not large enough for a queen sized bed, so they are largely unusable"
5,Fantastic! So thick & warm.,Haven't had a chance to wash them very much but they are so well made. I don't think pilling will be a problem. It's like slipping into a warm soft glove.
1,Worst transaction with Amazon Ever!,"Usually my purchases with Amazon are flawless, so I am saddened to have to write a bad review.This Bike came to us with the box crushed and literally broken and punctured held together with tape, I looked inside but really could not tell if everything was in there so we accepted it from Fed-XWe were missing several parts that we were going to try and just get from Amazon to make it work out, with out sending it back; however when my husband went to put on the front tire we noticed the front forks were severly bent, he said it had to have been run over by a truck and would not be something repairable. In all fairness this is the ONLY time we have ever gotten a bad item from Amazon and they were very good to take it back without a hassle so we will continue to shop with them in the future."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,"Do not buy this...total waste of money, unless you want to watch someone play very fast with zero explanations about what is going on. On the other hand, if you want to watch a dude play stuff really fast then act like any idiot should be able to do same, this is the DVD for you...."
1,Don't bother if you aren't Christian,"My boss handed this book to everyone to read at work, and several of us were highly offended. It's extremely religious and that's great if you're Christian, but if you aren't, it loses you very quickly.The authors lost credibility with me in the first chapter, where it says to not assume everyone will react to situations the same way as you, and then goes on to assume the whole world is, or should be, Christian. They don't truly understand the principle their book is based on.If you're looking at this professionally, either be very sure everyone in the group is very, very Christian or try something else, like books on Emotional Intelligence."
2,Not really what I expected...,"I wish I had seen some of the reveiws about this book's religious nature. The author is not heavy handed in his approach, rather unable to understand the fact that not everybody has read the Bibile back to back. There are several sections where I was simply reading the words to get to the next non-religious section. It is absolutely useless for me to read examples based on passages in the bible or working in/attending a church because I don't do either of these things. Each chapter has a little quote as a subtitle and I count 10 of the 30 being directly from the bible. I probably would not have bought the book if I had read a more accurate reveiw of the material. I am about halfway through, and will finish it... but I cannot help but write comments in this book as I pass through the more obtuse sections."
2,There is better for less,"Man I had thought this was going to be ""the knife"" and really I was not all that impressed. It looks fancy and has all the looks but falls short of being the go to knife. I tried cutting veggies and meat and I found myself digging in the drawer for a different knife. I'm no expert at this kind of stuff but I would say Look around....you will more than likely find a better knife and a better price."
1,useless book,"This book was too complicated for the beginner and too superficial for everybody else. While all the photos of plants contained more than one type of plant, the caption failed to identify more than one type and it was never clear which plant the caption was referring too. Many of the more complicated topics were treated so superficially as to be of any use to anybody and should have been left out entirely"
4,A great combat story,This is a compelling story. I read it since I know one of the SEALS involved. Hard to put down.
4,Another harrowing depiction,This is yet another harrowing depiction of the struggles and triumphs or special operators face day in and out. Sleep well knowing they are on watch.
5,Easy Rider,"If you enjoyed ""Easy Rider,"" and remember singing along to ""Don't Bogart That Joint,"" you'll love this CD. It's a good representative collection of the music we loved in 1969."
3,Easy Rider Deluxe is Just alright with me,I like this collection even though most of the additional songs had little to do with the movie. The additional tunes were mostly good ones that haven't been played to death (with some exceptions like White Rabbit) and were good to hear again. This collection lost a full star in my estimation because it is way over priced. I can't enjoy it as much as I would otherwise because of this.
5,"2 Months and No problems, so far",No complaints! This arrived promptly and as described. I would recommend this vendor for your Cat6 needs. A great value indeed!
4,Solid product,Glad I bought this cable along with the other ones. Good construction for long lasting wear and tear. Recommending this to others.
5,Highly recommended,"I've given/recommended this book to several off my friends and family members. It's genuinely helpful and doesn't toss in the clinical bullcrap that comes along with ""selfhelp"" books."
4,"I'm sure its not as corny as it seemed to me, meditating on this","I loved the original book (I also reviewed it) and I needed so much help to get out of ""love too much"" pattern with my ex husband. So I got this book. Daily meditations are indeed in line with all learned in the book, they are sort of daily reminders of all the little things we did wrong and all the things we need to change about US, but actually meditating on these, reading one per day seemed so corny. So I flipped thru it randomly and read several at one time until I would get tired, and then come back to it some other time. It might have worked better if I used it as prescribed, but I was too screwed up at the time. Unfortunately. For closing, here is one of my favorites: ""We are certain that if we show someone how much we love him, no matter how he treats us, he will change. What we are really showing him is that it is safe for him to remain the same"". Boy, was I champion of this particular mistake!"
5,Great customer service,"My mother order this and had it shipped to the wrong address because the internet is too difficult for her to manage. However, after speaking with the kind salesman who sold us the product, he quickly re-addressed the item and had it shipped to our correct address with no hassle or delay. The game works great, too."
4,good service,"My son really likes this Pokemon Fire Red Version, you can't find the new game in store, so we bought the used one. The game was fun to play but it's having the problem to save the game. After I e-mailed to the seller, they replied my mail without any question and promised to send me the other one. My son was so happy that he can play the game again without losing any memory. Buying the used one is OK, but you have to pick a good reputation seller to ensure the good service you will get."
5,Gift,"A gift for a child, he loved it and was very happy and enjoyed it, thanks this is the place I SHOP and have been very satisfied with all the products I have purchased and also they arrive very fast."
4,Pokemon Firered,"Now before you ""sterotypers"" say, ""it's a freakin pokemon game! That's for little kids"" do yourself a favor and go slap yourself; Pokemon is like any other RPG, except it has nostalgia written all over it.Firered is a remake of the first Pokemon game released on the Game Boy back in the late 90s. This ""remake"" features upgraded graphics, sound, and the same gameplay, which some other people may call linear, but it depends on how you play it.The only thing ""new"" about this remake is the fact that you can equip items onto pokemon like its previous predecessor (Ruby and Sapphire) and while veterans may get tired of ""catching them all"" hardcore gamers can now get the rest of their Pokemon collection now that this version and Leafgreen is released."
3,fast food for the soul,"This book is useful and easy reading but is a bit obvious. The content is a bit too simple. But is is probably worth the price. Though it is useful. To me it is like ""fast food for the soul"". Just when you get your teeth into it, it is finished. I did enjoy it. Try it you would like it."
4,Short but good,I enjoyed this book but it did not go into great depth. Francis Frangipane is great to read. Good resource book.
5,'Bend It' was hot in Chicago,"'Best British Invasion band to not make it' is correct, but this tune was well liked in the Midwest, if not throughout the US..they seemed like stars at the time."
3,Not as good as Jump Start Preschool,"I might have thought this game was great if I hadn't seenJUMP START PRESCHOOL ADVANCEDfirst. We got both games for our 2 1/2 year old son. Most of the features of Lego Preschool are not as good. For example, in the paint section of Jump Start Preschool, children can only use the correct color to paint the squares (if #4 squares are supposed to be blue, they can't use any other color for #4 squares). In Lego Preschool, they are supposed to use the correct color, but the game lets them use any color (so they can paint the #4 squares red or yellow or any color other than the correct blue). Lego Preschool's songs and pictures aren't near as interesting and it is also much more difficult for our son to navigate and figure out."
5,Worked when others did not,I had two Amazon mp3 downloads that would not burn in their entirety on other discs I tried. These CD-RWs are great!!
1,TDK Musical RW,"TDK CD-R80CB100 CD-R 80min, 700 MB, 52x (100-Pack Spindle)'I am extremely disappointed.CD RW's are supposed to be just that - rewritable. So far, out of 12 used (out of 30 purchased), nonehave worked more than once, and 2 didn't even work the first time. A clear breach of warranty.I don't expect RW's to last forever. The better quality ones I have used in the past wore out afterseveral uses - but probably around 10. At this point I would be satisfied to get 5 good uses out ofthem. But 1 use before being unusable is ridiculous.I have been too busy to contact Amazon, and I am still trying to find a number or e-mail to contactTDK. (By law I can go after the manufacturer and all sellers). But since you have asked for myreview, I am giving it."
2,disappointing and very depressing,"1) wake up in a saturday shining morning, full of life2) going to a market and remembering you liked Cure and Dark Music at 80's3) finding and buying this one, 3 euros used it's good4) trying to listening it all, to give a chance.5) going depressed and deceived.ok, 3 euros is worth, for collection.don't suggest it, buy the old ones!p.s. sorry, english is not my first language..."
4,sorting the canon,"when the cure's oeuvre IS finally done and this disc is reassessed, ""bloodflowers"" will be up there with the cream of the cure's crop--full stop, jock. this rock and lilting lullaby collection will give the unfaithful and faithful alike an aural erection. ""maybe sunday"" and ""there is no if"" and ""the loudest sound"" are among the most gorgeously melodic things this supermelodic combo has EVER done...this is one HELL of a SUBTLE record that only rewards after MANY listens--the best kinda LP, if you ask me! spend time with it; take it out to eat--then home to bed. sidenote: i really like that Beth Massa review--quite poetic! nice!"
3,Not their best...but probably not their last,"I decided to rewrite my review of ""Bloodflowers"" after giving it a few more listens. I still feel that this is one of the duller albums The Cure has released. About the only track that comes close to standing out is ""Maybe Someday"", but overall it is a bland experience. The drumming is dreadful - Boris, please come back! Even Lol sounded better than this. I don't see how ""Bloodflowers"" can be compared to either ""Pornography"" or ""Disintegration"", either of which is a far better album. It is more like a watered-down ""Wish"" than anything else. It's not exactly bad, but not exactly good, either. I have upped my rating from two stars to three, but ""Bloodflowers"" is in no way, shape or form the best album that The Cure has released. I hear that The Cure are working on a new album - I hope that it's better than this one."
4,beautiful music,"This is a great CD. The melodies the Cure amasses here are amazing. The lyrics are profound, and unlike some of their earlier CD's--although good--they make sense! But 4 stars because they can get a little wallowing and blurry at times and stuck in the depression rut, but only a little. Definitely worth the purchase!"
4,Not Disintegration or Pornography,"Let me preface by saying I'm a cure fanatic. I have nearly every song ever recorded by them, including non-album songs. It was exciting to hear that this album would follow in the tradition of Disintegration and Pornography, two of the best Cure albums. Unfortunately, Bloodflowers lacks the emotional intensity of both, and is not as musically interesting as Disintegration. There are some good moments here, and overall the album is better than most anything on the radio. But this one is just not as strong as other Cure albums (I ALMOST even like Wild Mood Swings better). By the way, it may take another five years, but this will not be the last Cure album."
4,Amazing,"This is a big value pack. If you bought it separately it would cost over $$21$$! Anyways it is real fun espically the night scope thing. The XP-4 Spy Pen's light is real bright, I recommend this to kids who want to read at night, but its bad to do that, though."
5,The Cowboy Want a Baby,Eve Bishop is really sick so she hires Lily Garret to find her grandson before she dies. She hasn't seen him in five years. Lily finds him but he's one ornery cowboy. Now Lily has to get him back with her. But how? So she answers his add but she's unsure what the add says. But she soon finds out. He wants to hire someone to have his child. So she sets a plan in motion to show him that is not the way it should be. What happens next?
5,My favorite book,I absolutely love this book. I bought it about 5 years ago and I still re-read it today. I think that Desdomena and Harry are fabulous characters. The dialogue between them is some of the best I have ever read. I think that the setting is marvalous too. Colonial Egypt has a great mystique and it allows the characters to have the special quirks which make them so memorable and enchanting.
2,Skip the Book,"I'm sorry, I have to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this forgettable piece of fluff. This is a novel that you will forget you have read within 24 hours. It is truly a junk read. There were no characters, only marks on the floor where cartoon standins for characters might eventually appear. It had the tone of a ""light-hearted romantic comedy"" without actually supplying any humor, romance or heart. It had all the depth of a comic book, with less artistry...."
4,Good Buy!!! and my Daughter loves it!!!,"I bought this for my daughter for christmas, she was 15 months at the time and she absolutely adores it! I looked everywhere for a simple chair and didn't want to spend a fortune on it either. The construction seems pretty sound and the fabric is cute. It does seem to pill a little, but for $50 bucks I can buy a few yds. of fabric and recover it if needed. I would definately reccommend it to anyone's child that wants to be like a BIG Girl!! She uses it everyday so in my eyes it has already paid for itself.P.S.- It's hard to find on the website unless you know what you are looking for. It's not listed in the chair section, I had to type in Sunshine Chair to find it."
2,Ugh,This book was long and overly obsessed with details! What should have been a touching story ended up seeming like someone's term paper.
2,it was good in the beggining but after a while!!!!,"This device does not work properly, price is not a bargain and cant transfer big files so its just sitting there."
1,LISTEN UP!,"I'm having the same trouble as everyone here. It's a piece of junk, don't waste your money on it. I have already gone through 2 of these."
1,I have lots of flash drives,"I have been buying flash drives since they first came out and as their capacity gets larger and larger, I keep buying the next larger capacity ones. So far, the only one that has failed is the Centon DataStick Pro (4 GB). I filled it up with data as a back-up for my hard drive and just went to get some of that data and it can not be read. I took it to a friend and his newer computer can not read it either. I tried on a brand new Windows 7 machine and it can not read it. It is the first drive of this type that I have seen fail and I have quite a few different sizes and brands."
1,Waste of Money,"After trying to transfer 8GB of files, it stopped and declared ""WRITE PROTECTED."" After searching many forums and help pages, I now have a very expensive paperweight. Not even heavy enough to hold down paper... What a waste of money."
5,"works fine, just as advertised","the Datastick worked fine right out of the box,but as soon as the family saw it they now want one alsooh well Merry Christmas"
1,Garbage,We got eight of these two months ago for use in our computer repair shop.Four of them are dead.The replacements are so much nicer.
4,very practical,"I love this ride-on toy. I had been looking around in target, toys r us etc for a simple ride-on, but they all had really fancy expensive things. This one is great. Inexpensive, simple and very sturdy, and my 18 month old loves scooting around on it on the deck. It's only weakness is that it doesn't really steer, but she figured out pretty quickly to just get off and move it when she runs into something. It seems more or less unbreakable to me, and totally weatherproof. I definitely recommend it for entertaining active toddlers."
3,A new singer and a new style,"""Entre el cielo y el infierno"" is Rata's fifth studio album and the only one with singer Mario Ian (ex Alakran). Mario has a Rob Halford style, so the songs sound heavier and powerful than ever before. Leader Walter Giardino decided to leave Ritchie Blackmore's influences and long neo-classical solos behind to focus their playing in the structure of songs. The album is rough and ""straight to head"" like bands like Judas Priest or Fight. In my opinion, is not Rata's best album, but it is an important record, 'cause it showns the ""heavier side of the band"". Specially check ""En el Bajo Flores"" (that talks about Giardino's neighbourhood) and ""Bajo Control"" to have a clearer idea of what I'm talking about."
5,A VERY NEEDFUL AREA FOR DISCERNMENT...,"Pastor Frangipane has touched upon a very controversial (but vital) area where satan (the deceiver and adversary) has *greatly* influenced and deceived men and women, both inside and outside the churches. The Jezebel/Ahab principality is (from my experience and discernment in ministry) a very, very powerful means of undermining values and authority that is required within the Kingdom of God. GOD HAS A DIVINE ORDER; satan ALWAYS seeks to subvert and pervert and usurp that Order andrighteous authority. Anyone involved in Christian ministry should read this book thoroughly and pray for discernment. The battle between Light and darkness, truth and rebellion is very, very real."
4,"Not the best, but near.","Actually, I don't think that is just so-so, and I think that's a big bargain in such prices! They did a reasonable job that played the pieces so naturally, peacefully and softly. In fact, that is what the later Mozart's pieces should be played, and the interpretation of them are also good. Overall, that's a good example of these pieces which were played very stably. Except the quality of recording, which got a little bit fuzzy of the cello, That's the one that people shouldn't underestimate it!"
3,Nice... but not too nice.,"This gets a thumbs sideways from me. I got the perfume because I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Pink Sugar... So I was expecting Chocolovers to smell super chocolate-ty, but it smells more like citrus & woods... Almost musty... It's a decent scent, IF you spray it in the air and walk through it... It was definitely not what I expected. I'll just stick with my Pink Sugar from now on."
3,Sinking Wafers,"I have been feeding this to my 4 lb. fish for years in this bulk package. Looks like they reduced the size of the wafers to about 1/4 of what they used to be which is not to my liking. Where I used to feed Fishy exactly 20 wafers, now I am not going to count out 80 mini wafers. I also believe some of these mini wafers get lost in the rocks and are uneaten."
2,I don't know what everyone is hyped about...,"First of all, this new album of theirs is hardly worth me taking the time to write this review. I think Bane was one of the best hardcore bands ever until I heard ""It all comes down to this"". That album was truly horrific in every way possible. No album will ever compare to their heavily revered EP. During the time of the release of their EP most hardcore was good and Bane was one of the best. Now, I regret to say, is the death of many hardcore bands including Bane. This new album is terribly boring. It has sappy breakdowns. And most depressingly, the vocals are tired and forced, as opposed to their EP. Everyone, if you haven't already, buy the EP. It has truly amazing breakdowns with a beautiful structure of verses, heart felt lyrics and vocals comparable to those of the most sincere hardcore band ever...Trial. This is a bad album, it wasn't worth the release and I can't believe everyone that posted likes it so much."
3,Shuts off,"I got my first 305 Edge about 4 yours ago but after about 6 months, the unit would just shut down and turn off during rides. When contacted Tech Support, the first thing they asked was if software updates current. I could never figure out how that should effect the unit turning off but whatever. Long story short, I had to send the unit back in and they replaced it. The replacement model worked fine for about two years and then whenever the temperature reached about 90 degrees or above, it would shut off like the first unit. Same question from tech support about software updates. Weather got cooler last fall and worked fine all winter and early spring. First day the temperature hit around 80 degrees, unit shut down. Also now even when cooler or warmer, if you hit a bump or go across runble strips, it shuts down.Great unit when it works but when it doesn't, good luck."
4,Garmin 305 Review,"Works great, with a few minor notes:1. heart rate monitor battery was dead after first use. Was giving erratic readouts, which was due to the bad battery.2. Garmin needs to get rid of the Adobe SGV Viewer application since it did not load properly on my Windows XP w/Explorer. Garmin has indicated that a SW update will soon correct this and remove the need for the SGV Viewer. Most key functionality was still present without this, and it only applied to the MotionBased application."
2,Mystery reader,"This book counts on having the reader care why one of the main characters was killed. Unfortunately, the book didn't make me care enough. The setting is very nice but the plot is just average as the profusion of suspects is brought to light. I'm still trying to figure out the picture on the cover and what it has to do with the story."
5,Another winner!,Ms Crombie has written another great London police procedural. She has great characters who seem like some one you would like to get to know.
5,Totally Awesome,I bought this product and I totally love it. It's got all the Videos plus they have New Interviews and Old Interviews with the band. Really cool stuff. I totally recommend this to anybody who loved Dokken in the 80's!!!!!
3,"Lots of pockets, but laptop pocket was placed poorly","I got this bag as a gift and the first thing I marveled at was how many pockets there are. There's a place for just about everything. The things that I'm not too happy about are: 1) the placement of the laptop compartment underneath the front flap. IMHO, this should really be in the center compartment of the bag. I find that when I'm only carrying my laptop, the bag will topple over on its side and never be able to stand up on its own. 2) There's zippers that open up on the bag so that you can put it on top of a rolling suitcase. I thought this was super handy at first, until the bag kept slipping off my suitcase and got all turned around on the handlebar.This bag can fit an enormous amount of stuff, but for the sake of your back (but probably not your fashion sense) you may want to consider getting a rolling laptop bag."
5,Absolutely Love this Book!,"This was one of the first cookbooks I got when I went vegetarian almost 7 years ago. It is such a well-written and innovative book. You get recipes for authentic ""soul-food"" dishes without compromising your ethics. There are also lots of recipes for raw foods. I have tried many of the recipes (not all yet) and they always turn out fabulously. The cornbread recipe is a staple in my house as is the granola recipe and the carrot cake recipe. You will not be disappointed by this book. I hope to one day get out to Washington, DC to visit the restaurant owned by the writers. This book is highly, highly recommended."
2,Not the best,Second Wahl I have bought that wouldn't clip my little dogs hair. I bought a wahl several years ago to clip her and it worked great but it finally wore out. Guess they don't make them like they used too.
5,Paid for itself the first use.,Great value and it worked flawlessly.With the supplied attachments I have everything I need.And all for just about the price of one haircut
1,junk,Expected quality from Wahl...but got junk with no quality control. One of the screws holding the cutting blade in place was completely stripped out and now the blade is held in place by only one screw. Looks like I'm the one screwed on this deal. Will be the last Wahl I purchase (have owned three others). Inspect upon arrival to verify that it isn't junk.
2,not worth it.,"Worked fine for the first few haircuts but then the metal pice above the blades, moved and was cutting everyone who used it. itspretty shitty. I say spend at least 50 bucks for a haircut machine. i learned my lesson"
5,clipper kit,Great product for the price. Comes with everything that you need & then some. Makes hair cutting easy! A great buy!
4,Wroks well,"This Kit works much better than the older model Wahl we had, more consistent cut for the price we paid."
1,SO loud,These clippers are super loud and about make you go deaf. Had to use ear plugs when cutting my husbands hair. They also get really hot and cause your hand to vibrate a ton so you can't use them for long. I was hardly able to get all my dogs hair cut (and he's less than 20#) before it all became too much for my hand. They also effectivly stopped working after 3 human haircuts and 2 dog cuts.
5,excellent for the cost,"These work well. I had a different brand that started to pull and tear at the hair so thought I would try these.I only use for trim and touch up but they are better than the other. They are precise and easy to use and very quiet.They also come with a big selection of spacer combs that make it hard to chop too much hair off at one time.I was missing the 3/16th inch spacer which was perfect for close sideburns so I called the 800 number. ""Yes sir we'll send you one tomorrow free of charge"".Very nice. Great service. I received it in 3 days and it works great. This is a definite bargain. Excellent!"
5,Three haircuts later...happy!,Gave my 3 little grandsons haircuts right after I received it. Will get better with practice but overall worked great! Only used 2 of the comb sizes so far but looking forward to experimenting with the others. Luckily they're young enough to let me try new things!
1,Broke after only a few uses,Mine broke after one use and now makes extremely loud buzzing noises whenever you try to use it. I am scared to hold it anywhere near myself now.
3,not sure about it,"Never used it, looks like a nice enough unit. I'm went with a Wahl cordless and I'm giving this as a gift."
4,works well,wE HAVE 4 kids and cut all of their hair with this. It works well and does not cut them but it does their hair. Greta value
4,decent motor,i tried a different brand before that had a weak motor. total waste of money. this one has a powerful motor. plenty of attachments for the entire family. no grabbing/pulling. good price especially with the mail in rebate.
4,"Great Value & Recommended (Excluding One Factor RE: ""Black"" Hair)","[...]. Based on the reviews I read on Amazon, I took a chance and purchased Wahl Color Pro instead. Besides the color guides (which are great), the instructional manual is very helpful although basic. Unfortunately, it caterers more to ""caucasian"" haircutting techniques. Additionally, the other negative factor I have about this set is that, the ""outlining"" (or taping/trimming) capability of these clippers are poor as it pertains to ""Black"" OR ""African-American"" hair texture and length. Fortunately, I found a few tutorials on YouTube [...]. One tutorial shows you how to make regular clippers - RAZOR SHARP for trimming and taping Black hair. After adjusting my clippers according to the tutorial, I am very satisified with them. Additionally, THE CLIPPERS ARE NOT NOISY AT ALL. They sounds just like regular ones. I am glad I purchased this kit and I haven't regretted it yet."
5,Worth every penny.,Recommendation: Buy a trimmer with this clipper. You will need it to do your hair edge lines and sideburns.Got tired of waiting at haircut places and bought this clipper. My wife used this product four times now to cut my hair... so far it's been great! Worked as described. No pinching or no pulling. Easy to use with the guides.
3,so so,Clipper guides are very flimsie...4 out of 8 of the guides were broken. I didn't bother with a time consuming return because the guides from my old clippers fit.
1,"so loud, can't bear it!","I had this for 1 year and half now, at the begining, it is good enough to handle my kids hair, but after half year, it make so loud noise, my kid is so scard of it, so he hates hair cutting since then, besides, certain hair clipper falls off easily.i deceide to go for another brand recently, hopfully i can get a better one."
2,Good tool for Archos but at very much cost,"Its a good accessory for Archos product, I have 604 wifi. Its compatible with generation 4 Archos devices.Pros:1) Good build2) Enough connections to expandcons:1) It very much costly as compare to it utility.2) It comes with charger which should be a part of standard item.3) There could be more cables included in this package like SPDIF, USB Mini cable.4) In this cost it could have a backup battery (extra) that could be part of (built in) the Docking station, so that Archos device can have longer play time.I think Archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can, if it is then it would not go a long."
4,Nice,I am using this for more than one yaer now.I works will and the recouding is great.The only thing didnot work for me is the changing chanels for the reciver becuase I could not find my reciver in the List.
2,Only 6 tracks work,This CD is poorly made. Only the first 6 tracks play. It was a waste of money and I'm sorry that I bought it.
4,excellent,"This is one of my favorite Wesleyan books. It explicates what often gets overlooked, but is essential to Methodist theology, that we are given grace but then we must respond to it if we are to receive salvation.I agree with the reviewer who says Maddox makes a little too much in this book of Wesley's Eastern Orthodox influences. They were there, but maybe not to the degree Maddox indicates.Still, it was one of the assigned books on Wesley in seminary, and I have continued to find it useful."
2,IMAGE LOST,"I was shocked and dismayed to see Alfred Noyes' beautiful dramatic poem-The Highwayman- depicted as "" Hells Angels""!I used to cry when I read it!No longer - his image has been erased from my mind."
1,a big disappointment,"It's not like their previous work. It's like the second half of converting vegetarians and if possible even weaker than that. The lyrics are a joke and there are way too many. The music is slow, boring and predictable."
5,Excellent Fast-paced Read,"Being one of the charactors in Gerry's book my opinion might be slightly biased, but I found that he was able to deliver the message we as contractors have been saying. We are just trying to support our military & governments desires as objectively as possible. There are just some jobs that contractors are better suited for, to free up our troops to acheive their missions. We ask for no awards, citations, or publicity. Just the satisfaction of a job well done. Colonel Schumacher has done that with this book, pulling no punches. We have made mistakes, along with our government & military. But he has explained why we are neccessary to in order for Iraq succeed as a new nation. If you have any doubts as to why American contractors are in a war zone to begin with, buy this book."
4,Great Product,"This was the first time I have tried the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisture foundation, and it will not be my last.It is pricey, but you do get what you pay for, and this deserves it's price tag.This is a great product, that goes on smooth and evenly, while locking in moisture.I do not look madeup, but still have a very good coverage.Since I am 61 years old this is extremely important to me.Oil Free Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20 - Fawn"
3,Made me tear,"laura mercier 1.5 oz tinted moisturizer spf 20 - nudePurchased this at Sephora in the Sand color. I love the coverage and the ability to ""build"" up on trouble spots. Unfortunately, it makes my eyes tear to the point, I end up wiping off all my makeup. At first I thought it was my eye makeup, but when I wore my eye makeup without the moisturizer, I had no problems. So I tried just applying the moisturizer and sure enough, within a half hour my eyes started to tear. I even tried it a few times after that, making sure to keep away from my eyes but I continued to have the problem. It also seemed to make my skin feel oily."
3,Not quite what I thought.,It was not as detailed as the picture made it seem. It fell over on my table and the leg broke off. Be careful.
5,Worth Every Penny! Highly recommended.,"This is by far the best math workbook we've ever used. It comes with Teachers Handbook and Answers. It has review skills before each lesson and a quick lesson on how to do the problems on each page. I wish I had found this one long ago, before I wasted my money on the others."
2,HARRY HARRISON LOSES FACE,"Harry, how could you! After creating the inimitable Stainless Steel Rat, you put in in a STUPID non-existent storyline! You send Slippery Jim back and forth in time aimlessly, the archvillain is titled ""HE"" (was that name the best you could do?), and then the end is not the least satisfactory. Harry, the absurd point of the story was to make sure the Stainless Steel Rat could not be around to be a father to his twins. What a disappointment when the best part of the story is the brief repartee between Slippery Jim and his boss, Inskipp. I know you can do better, Harry, because you have in your other books. Readers, if you like the Rat, skip this one."
4,big surprise,"I was never into rpg, so when I ordered this game online I thought it'd be a fun action fighting game,(not knowing it was rpg). when it arrived i had the means to sell it or something but decided to give it a try but I didn't plan on getting hooked on the game so I got more into rpg eversince enchanted arms. Its story line is like a mix of SCRY ED and Naruto if ur into that kind of thing. Even Xplay gave it a good review, so don't be like me, don't judge by the cover. Also the comic is very interesting2 makes you think it was a manga first."
2,Bland Recordings of Good Songs,"I bought this because of the unavailability of ""Plays the Devil's Music"" and was disappointed. It may technically sound better, as one reviewer said, but it doesn't have the lo-fi charm of the original recordings. Instead of sounding twisted, it's just generic. ""Frotting with Ennio"" is particularly flat. Sorry."
2,Too many characters,"I've only read 2 of his books but I found both are so aggravating I doubt I'll read another. The stories are so complex you don't even get to know the characters, much less care about them. The secondary characters seem to consist of politicians/law enforcement types only concerned with keeping their jobs, which is a large focus of each book, and incredibly tedious. His sentence structure is cumbersome and irritating to read, even awkward at times. I don't understand the appeal-"
5,An Inspiring Work,"Professor Hobsbawm reminds us why we do academic history. Take this book as part of a broad foundation in Historiography and ignore claims about ""snobbery"" for if anyone has a ""right"" to tell us how to do things, it is Hobsbawm.Also recommended:Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries,Age of ExtremesandFreud for Historians(by Peter Gay)."
4,One Day's Journey,"Delivery was great (as usual!). I bought the book because I'm working on my family's genealogy and my family is mentioned in here. I am going to visit relatives I've never met, and want to give them each a copy so I need to stock up. :-)"
1,Is being this dumb painful?,"The sad thing is that young, impressionable people will read this garbage and believe it. If you notice some of the same morons that created a ""conspiracy"" industry regarding the JFK murder are resurfacing for the 9/11 inside scoop.Hundreds of witnesses SAW, with their own eyes, a commerical 757 hit the pentegon. I know, George Bush must have paid these people off....and he is hiding the passengers of Flight 77 in a Bunker and paying off their families with all the additional money he made from ""Big Oil"".Please don't fill this idiots pockets by purchasing this garbage."
5,One of the best books on a difficult subject.,"This is an excellent, thoroughly researched book. Also recommended is the companion DVD, PAINFUL DECEPTIONS:http://question911.com/Also recommended areTHE NEW PEARL HARBOR by David Ray GriffinandIN PLANE SITEhttp://policestate21.com"
4,Easy to read and remember,"This short story offers valuable insights on creativity and innovation. The world of the ""senior idea forager"" of The Big Black And White Company is shaken by the arrival on the scene of The Color Company, and his mission to find the secret of their success. A conversation unfolds, in which ten ""creative rules"" are presented, from basic to eye-opening. This book turns out to be a nice stepping stone into Firestien's world of creativity. I'm already reading ""Leading on the Creative Edge"", which is an in-depth explanation of creative principles."
1,40% Polyester,"I needed a cool, 100%-cotton T-shirt to wear while working out. That's how Amazon described this product: 100% cotton. But what I received is 40% polyester---much too warm for workouts.Be careful when shopping from Amazon's Hanes T-shirt page. It's convenient because it presents T-shirts in a wide range of colors, in various fabrics, and from various vendors. But this multiplicity of options increases the risk of ending up a product different from the one you selected online._ _ _ _ _In looking over earlier reviews, I see that other customers have had the same problem. Perhaps Amazon and its vendors think customers don't really care whether a T-shirt is 100% cotton or 40% polyester. If you care, beware!"
1,Light Heavyweight,Heavyweight? It it the thinest t-shirt I own. Makes me wonder what a normal Hanes t-shirt is like.
3,Almost heavyweight,"It's not honest to call these 'heavyweight'. They're about half the weight of older heavyweights I've had.Still, they're OK T shirts, delivered promptly."
3,"Poor shirts, Excellent Seller","You get what you pay for. I did not like these T shirts at all. I just wanted something to knock around the house in, but these felt thin and ill fitting despite being advertised as a heavy weight cotton. My Hanes 3 per package undershirts fit better and are of a better quality than these. However, I sent them back promptly in their original packages and NY Lingerie promptly refunded my total purchase price plus S&H. I don't like these shirts, but the seller is good to deal with."
2,Super itchy label after a few washes.,The print on the inside of the neck gets itchy after a few washes as the ink cracks. Will not buy them again (normal tags are far better).
4,t-shirt,The hanes 5250 cotton shirt I ordered fits well. This style t-shirt is tightly woven cotton and heavy duty for a t-shirt. The hanes 5250 is a quality t-shirt with a well stiched neck and arm cuffs. Iam 6' tall and the shirt is long enough to tuck in but not so long that it is uncomfortable to tuck in.
5,It's really good enough,"As an Indonesian, I'm really happy that there's a man from outside Indonesia whos cares about Indonesia. This book tells us about Indonesia inside and outside, and even though some informations are still far from the truth, i still think it's a good source for you all to know more about my country. As all Indonesians know,Indonesia has been told as a really bad country all around the world by the west. So i hope this book can change people's thoughts about my lovely ""rich"" country."
2,Linda Ellerbee,"I've enjoyed reading Linda Ellerbee's columns for many years. This book, however, was somewhat of a disappointment as her essays seemed ""disjointed"" and it was difficult to stay interested."
4,good background info.,"I Recommend this book as a companion to Natural Childbirth the Bradley way. The book has a lot of great background information and is interesting to read. It does not, however, have the practical information that you would need for childbirth, look for that in Natural Childbirth the Bradley way. It is this book that got me interested in Natural childbirth in the first place.My mom had a horrible labor when she gave birth to me. I expected a simlar ordeal when I had my daughter. I thought for sure that I would need drugs, because if women who had drugs told me how bad the pain was it must be awful without them. When I read this book it made me feel that labor might not be so bad after all. My husband and I took the bradley classes and by the end felt educated and confident about the birthing process. I had my daughter naturally 20 days ago with no intervention. My mom was present and was amazed at how well the birth went. I am recommending this book to all my pregnant friends."
3,very opinionated and somewhat outdated,"Dr. Bradley has a wonderful method of natural childbirth as far as breathing and relaxation but he has very outdated views on circumcision, episiotomies, and attachment parenting. As a La Leche League Leader and a future Bradley Instructor, I would say read the book and take with you what works, such as the breathing, relaxation, and postpartum information, and leave what won't work for you."
3,Self promotion,"My husband and I purchased this book because we have neither the time nor money to attend classes. The book does offer some valuable information but the particulars of exercises are not described. Instead the book says that you/ your wife will learn the particulars from her Bradley teacher. The book does a good job of offering encouragement and making natural childbirth seem like an enlightening joyous occassion. Although most of the information doesn't seem dated, the refrences to opposition does. The book thinks that having a husband in the delivery room will be faced with great opposition. There are also several sentences and phrases that get repeated throughout the book as if it is trying to brainwash these ideas into your mind. Although it is a good refrence to have, it could not replace taking an actual class or having more detailed instructions."
4,There IS a better way!,"And this book definitely shows you how. It is written to the coach- husband usually, but can also be a very close friend. Although some language may be outdated, and some studies referenced are quite out-of-date, the methods (including exercises, relaxation postures, nutrition and other methods of communicating with physicians) are spot on!I would purchase this book and Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way in order to get a complete education in the Bradley Method (Husband-Coached Childbirth has no photos, and can get a bit wordy- the other one has photos and is written more as an instruction manual)."
4,Great book!,"My Husband and I really liked this book. It helped my Husband feel more involved, and understand what was going on with his wife and the baby. It was exciting for me to see how he wanted to be halpful and coached me to do even some of the smallest excercises. It is very infomative, and helpful. I would highly recommend this book!"
4,Solid Introduction to the Bradley Method,"Dr. Bradley is not shy about taking credit for developing this childbirth method, which he considers the first natural childbirth method, and his self-congratulatory style may turn some people off. However, if you want to get a good introduction to the Bradley childbirth method or even just to natural childbirth in general, this book will give you what you need. After reading this book, you should be able to decide whether or not you want to take an actual class in the method, which you'll need if you decide to actually use the techniques during childbirth."
2,Skip this and get Ms. McCutcheon's book instead,"Being the dutiful book-worm that I am, I thought I should go to the ""source"" to understand the Bradley method. I would say that only 10-20% of this book was useful. It is hopelessly outdated, despite being a ""revised edition""; Bradley spends the majority of the time railing/advocating against ""standard"" birth practices (heavy use of anaesthesia, no dads in the delivery room, etc.) that may have been the norm when he first began developing his method, but are no longer. In short, he's preaching to the choir. I read the whole thing and promised I would pick out the salient parts for my husband...those parts would comprise maybe 10 pages. So, my advice is: skip this and get McCutcheon's book instead, which is more up to date and more practical."
2,Bradley method,"Read ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way: Revised Edition by Susan McCutcheon-Rosegg, Erick Ingraham, and Robert A. Bradley""instead. Doctor Bradley is definatly a doctor, and not a writer.LOVE the method though!"
2,Ummm..,I think this is crap after having had a baby. Maybe because my uterus is stuck to my colon but natural child birth was brutal. I did it but by no help of this book.
3,Relevant content. Diffcult to read. Needs pictures.,"One reviewer writes, ""quite egotistical and sexist in tone, and very biased in pushing one way of viewing childbirth""Who cares? What about the content? ... As a ""husband"", here's my review ... The Goods: 1. The content. 2. He ""pushes"" the approach. If you understand natural childbirth, you should feel OBLIGATED to ""push"" this approach out of respect and care for other mothers-to-be. The Bads - the time is takes to understand or ""picture"" the content. If a picture is worth a thousands worth, than save me an hour - show me the picture. A more effective solution is to read ""Natural Childbirth, the Bradley Way"". This book is loaded with pictures and photos to explain the process far more effectively."
4,"Convincing to use the method, but not as helpful to learn it!","I purchased this book since I could not attend the classes due to my work schedule. It is a great book to tell you about the benefits of the Bradley Method, but unfortunately it didn't give me as much specific information as I would have liked about the actual method itself, like the breathing, exercises and relaxation. The book I got later ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way"" was much more informative on what to do, as opposed to just why you should use the method."
3,Carly is growing to a new level,"Carly keeps getting better on her second album.""Anticipation,"" is one of the greatest songs Carly has ever written.I love the ending the most,""These are the good old days."" That's so true.Right now is the day you'll remember when you look back on your life.""Julie through the Glass,"" about a new born baby is fantastic.My cousin named her daughter after this song,and her son's name is Jessie.""Legend in Your own time"" was never even released as a single,but one of Carly's most well know records.It was great when Carly opened her 1995 concert with,""I've got to have you.""She sings this old song so much better then on this album.It seems like every record Carly reaches a higher level."
2,All-star line-up but Queen still Rocks!!,"This disc has a very impressive line-up of great musicians including some of the greatest session players of all time (Steve Lukather, Tony Franklin, Tony Levin) but unfortunately it doesn't stack up against the original Queen recordings at all. In fact no one really gets anywhere near to nailing their track. You might find this disc interesting if you want to hear how some of your favourite musicians tackle some Queen classics but don't expect too much. Queen recordings are just too good to be compared to any other versions, no matter how talented the line-up."
3,"Reveal the new licence agreement on Royal BayRhum, not made in Bermuda","Fragrance is acceptable but not like original which was made in Bermuda with an actual leaf in the bottle. After reading the label I was disappointed to find that the product was now licensed and made in USA, it has a slightly different fragrance than the original."
4,useful introduction,A very useful introduction to academic publishing. Have used this book for several years in an introductory Ph. D. course I teach
2,Not a bargain,"In theory there probably really is nothing much wrong about this performance, but then again, there isn't that much that is exceptional either. What IS noteworthy is the lousy engineering (Naxos has done MUCH better). The woodwinds are in your lap, the percussion, especially the timpani, are hiding behind a thick velvet curtain, and the strings are muffled under water. Janacek's music is there, but you can hardly hear it. Lenard doesn't pay that much attention to details, and tends to homogenize the spiky textures of Janacek's orchestration; he also phrases so that the motifs are choppy and not well-connected. However, the clarinetist is worth hearing in V for his/her big melody line, although the piccolo s/he is paired with is well below par. Your bargain CD dollars are spent better elsewhere. Even well-engineered mono recordings would outclass this one."
2,Mistakes,"There are some mistakes in Sinfonietta. Especially, the timpany player made some big mistakes in the 1st and 5th movements. Also, the extra brass players for Sinfonietta are not very good. Their performance is somewhat uncontrolled."
2,Light Cheap Plastic,I was expecting quality stainless steel/chrome for that price. Not sure its worth that price. Doesnt look very flashy as expected. Unfortunately its opened and cant be returned. But was quite pleased with the chrome license frame holder from TVG.
5,Love this yoga workout!,I really love this yoga video. I had taken it out of the library before I bought it and so I had used it several times already. It is the perfect video for short yoga practices - and you can do several of the sessions if you want a longer practice. The teachers work very well together. Everything is demonstrated so that you know exactly what to do.
3,Gets the Job Done but Could Have Been Better,"The four 15-minute videos are perfect for variety when I'm doing my morning yoga. This DVD gets the job done and I enjoy three out of the four routines. The core yoga routine is little to be desired but the other three are pretty good. The reason I only rated it three stars is the banter between the two of them. They chat during the yoga poses, they chat in between the yoga poses (sometimes so much you miss a cue and your still in downward dog while somehow they are in mountain pose), and they chat during final relaxation. It is pretty distracting and not so relaxing when they are explaining to you how relaxing and important final relaxation is during final relaxation. I'll continue to use this DVD until I find a replacement. If you are looking for a morning yoga tape this will work just beware of the banter."
5,good quick workouts,"These are great for when you only have 15 minutes. The banter between Rodney and Mariel can get old after a while, but I'm used to Rodney's quieter only talk when you must style.After a while you get so used to a routine that you can just turn down the sound anyway. This packs as much workout as you can get into 15 minute segments and if you're feeling motivated you can do 2 at a time."
4,Our Female Ancestors,"This book is a must-have for genealogical research for finding and understanding a woman's role in the family role, such as mother, wife, sister, head of household. A very good addition to your library of family history."
3,"Did NOT come with 8"" carving knife","I just received this item and it did NOT come with the 8"" carving knife. It had shears/scissors instead of the 8"" carving knife. Not sure if I want to keep it or not."
5,great knives,You can't go wrong with Wusthof knives. They are perfectly balanced and feel great in your hand. I've had these for several years and they're still in great shape.
2,Read the book,"Christmas Shoes movie was much more faithful to the book. The Christmas Blessing had too many differences, and not to its betterment. The book is infinitely better."
5,Intelligent Plan to Losing Weight and Improving Your Health,"This book is fantastic! I bought it because I saw Dr. and Mrs. Larson being interviewed on a tv program regarding this new health book. They are not only a charming couple, but this is the type of information I was seeking. I have improved my health tremendously (demonstrated on my annual nuclear stress test and other tests) by following for several years, my cardiologist's advice of limiting red meat, reducing fat intake and using small amounts of virgin, first-pressed olive oil and canola oil only. I am now buying the supplements and brands that Dr. Larson recommends, i.e., fish-oil capsules. Where else could I receive this important information? Thanks, Dr. Larson, for your wonderful book."
4,Great book & Exercise DVD,"I have been suffering with a neurological illness for quite a time.This book opens doors of hope and after checking what was brought to my attention, through Ivy, I have hope.A must read for all with the ten illnesses mentioned. Great deal for a great book.The reason I rated this with 4 stars is that my specialists have all told me NOT to use Splenda... it is associated with neurological problems."
4,Makes a lotta sense!,I was impressed by the the credentials of these authors as well as their research into diet and physical fitness. I will try the eating plan simply to lose weight and become healthy.
4,the gold coast cure,"I felt the book was very informative. I also agreed with most of their views. The only thing I DID NOT agree with and that I feel they DID NOT research was the substitution for sugar-using SPLENDA-..SPLENDA IS NOT healthy, it is in the same category as Nutrasweet, Equal, Sweet & Low Etc..It is a Chemical and therefore our bodies CANNOT utilize these, alot of people have had life threatening illness from these..They say Splenda is different, made from sugar, which is true BUT after the processing (bleaching etc.) it ends up a chemical just like the other sugar substitutes which is NOT healthy so changing your eating habits without eliminating this from your diet is NOT helping your health...Thanks for listening...Lee Wicks"
5,Swamp Fox,Swamp Fox on the Kindel was excellent however 20 pages are not able to read and made it difficult with a missing section of just letter's and symbols on the left side.
1,Waste Waste Waste,"I was hoping for something between Backyard Brawls & GGW. Instead, a guy with really long hair & a soul patch (some of the video) asked college kids if they like sex, what kind, technique & the like. Some flashing. Couple of fights as well as destruction of property & giving beer to a goat. Most of it was shot at night with little to no light. The clearest parts were of the guys vomiting. As I said, a waste. With shipping, I paid $4.34. I overpaid by $4. The bonus features were previews for behind the scenes wrestling dvds & interviews. Also what was already shown in the video."
4,11-11-11 revelation,This was a most compelling work which revealed some of the arrogance & stupidity of the military leaders of the U.S. and rest of the allies. Unfortunately the frontline troops pay the price for the poor decisions made by back line officers. I found this work reassuring that we as a country survive some of this poor leadership & come out strong because of the American spirit.
2,Not great,"These iron covers appear to be good, but they do not fit well and fall off easily. I have been using them for less than a month and have lost two due to them falling off the clubs while in a cart. There must be better ones available."
2,Wouldn't purchase again,"Power supply looks to be of ok quality and appears to work well. However, there is quite a bit of fan noise. I'm in the computer business, and I have a lot of experience in building and repairing PC's, and this supply is one of the loudest I have come across yet.I've only had one other experience with the Ultra company, and it was with an ATX case, of inferior quality. I should have known better, and not ordered a power supply from the same manufacturer. - Not recommended"
4,Many connections but can not make room room for cooling,If you are planning to arm a pc with two nvidia video cards and at least three hard drives its ok but be aware that you have to take in consideration a huge case because power supply cables will take plenty of space.
4,not bad,"good performance, a bit loud though. perfect for those who do not want to pay too much but want a decent PSU with a known brand name."
2,?,"The only real drama from this episode was from my worrying that Don/Dick hadn't taken down the curtains at his ex's house before slopping paint on the wall.I strained to discover any subtleties within the episode (because I really wanted to find some) but was left empty and wanting.Weird and hopefully, just a hiccup in the series."
5,Best Season of M/M yet,"Season 4 was a great one in terms of following the Don Draper (Jon Hamm) character's ""slow burn"" journey. Hamm (if he wasn't) should have been nominated for an Emmy. His acting was superb throughout! Also, each show has at least 2 running commentaries, including one with the show's creator and writer of several episodes Matthew Weiner. I highly recommend picking up this S4 set, and I cannot wait for the show to return with S5 in early 2012."
2,PR Firms Planting Posts for Mad Men,"I am reading this other 5-star review of this episode by ""Carol"" and it is written and reads like a PR firm having planted a review for Mad Men.Why does Carol's commentary without any real editorial and perfect aliteration seem like someone wanted to balance the existing 2-star rating by a real viewer?Anyhow, this episode was dismal and lacking in content, and no amount of planted commentary by interested econoomic parties will change that fact. I have watched all four seasons of Mad Men, though a dark show with little noble in its characters it has been entertaining.But based on content and such this does seem to be its last season."
1,Amazon... get your act together,"I'm getting really sick of purchasing these videos and then not being able to view them for 3-4 days because it keeps telling me I can't connect. And this isn't happening right after the show broadcasts either. I'm trying to watch Mad Men, episode 8 a week after it was shown and I still can't get on after repeated attempts. Amazon, have a little class and fess up to having technical issues instead of telling us to try again later."
5,loved it,love this series. amazon sent it to me every Monday morning like clockwork! much better than cable and I can watch whenever I want.
1,Download problems,"The program is great, but the video didn't download whne I wanted it, and Amazon refused to give a refund because they said the video ""on demand"" was available later.Try another source."
2,Amazon viewer is unacceptable video and audio quality,"Great show, but almost ruined by poor quality viewer and audio - and no it wasn't my laptop that was at fault.I'll never use this viewer again and will recommend those I know to avoid Amazon on demand videos like the waste of time / money / credits they are.Austin"
2,Worst episode of the series so far,"My apologies to Matt Weiner, who has created one of the most interesting TV series in Mad Men in years. Some parts of this series are magnificent.But this episode should never have been written and never have aired. Most of it seems to comprise characters getting drunk and behaving irrationally and out of character. Getting drunk may well be enjoyable, but it's extremely boring to watch drunk people talk like idiots for 40 minutes. Furthermore, they aren't actually talking about anything - it's one of the ""relationship"" episodes where characters moon (drunkenly) about their latest relationships.Matt, there are literally hundreds of TV series we can watch if we want to see people whine about their relationships. Mad Men is interesting because of the ads, the intellectual striving, the irony. Enough with the alcoholic mooning about!"
3,Mad Men writers are running out of ideas,"My wife watches alot of PM soaps.She thinks that MM is similar, with higher production values.I can't argue the point."
3,Different Foreword Without Warning,"The star rating I posted is N/A, I just put something cause I had to. I'm sure I will enjoy the body of the book; however, I'm pretty upset that the original foreword by Jorge Luis Borges has been removed and replaced by Russell Shorto's without indication here on Amazon in the official review (where it still states the JLB foreword is included).I realize this is a minor point, but there may be others like myself out there who are/were looking forward to the JLB foreword, especially since precious little of his writing has been translated into English. This is an oversight on the part of Amazon. Perhaps if one could get a customer service rep on the phone and product returns were not such a huge pain in the butt, I could return it."
2,"Good, but ""Irish Gangs And Stick-Fighting"" better.","The upcoming film by Martin Scorcese is based on the first half of this book 'The Gangs Of New York'. The first half deals exclusively with Irish gangs, and while it's flashy and exotic, there isn't much substance in the original book. It's good, but it doesn't explain the fighting traditions and rituals of the Irish gangs, it simply describes them in a sensational way. Hurley's book remedies this problem by providing first hand accounts of Irish gangs and fights, written by a 'reformed' Irish stick-fighter. It vividly describes Ireland's fighting culture which was goverened by a code of honour which Hurley rightly calls 'Shillelagh Law'. If you are Irish or have an interest in Irish gangs or Scorcese's film, I'd say get 'The Gangs Of New York', but to understand the hype behind the myth, get Hurley's 'Irish Gangs And Stick-Fighting' - you will really enjoy it."
5,Great Book For The Interested!,This is a great book for those interested in the roots of New Yorks dark side. There is much more to this book than what was made into the recent movie with the same title and the book even shows how the movie was not made 100% accurate. Being written in the early 1900s this book can give you a window to a time long gone. If you know about New York and its areas then this book may fascinate you but if not it could be boring. But I give it an A plus rating.
1,"Nowhere near ""A Skeleton in God's Closet""","I loved the book A Skeleton in God's Closet, the novel to which this is a sequel of sorts. I read the last 200 pages in one sitting; it was that gripping. When I heard there was a sequel, I got excited. Big mistake. This novel is subpar, and contains some of the most awkward, clunky prose I've ever read. Honestly, I couldn't get through it. I gave up. Most of the complaints I have are similar to the ones listed in other reviews, but I will reiterate: none of the characters seemed like real people, especially when they opened their mouths. Maier aims for hip, semi-humorous dialogue, but it falls flat with too many ""darlings"" and ""no problemas"". Maybe, just maybe, some of the dialogue would have worked on screen, but in a novel moments where the characters joke with each other by taking on accents they don't normally have don't work. Everyone got to be so annoying that I just gave up. There are tons better books for you to read. Don't waste your time here."
3,OK! :),"The package was received damaged, had some wearing, highlights and tear. However, for the price I paid for this book, I must say it is very useful and convenient especially if you will only using it for a class."
2,Is there a doctor in the house?,"I too am a big fan of bossa nova, for going on 30 years now, and I ordered this CD with great enthusiasm and anticipation as soon as I heard of its release. Now that I've listened to it a few times running, all I can say is ""GIVE ME THE PROZAC!"" I'm sorry, but the recording sounds so exhausted and lethargic that my mood immediately descended about 40 fathoms. It has its moments, but for the most part it is so tired and dull that I kept checking my CD player to see if there was something wrong with the tempo. My heart will always hold a warm place for Joao Gilberto, but this music sounds like a lone, private practice session on Gilberto's rear veranda, recorded after a long and tiresome day that he would rather forget. Those who want to learn more about the worthy place held in music history by this wonderful musician should look elsewhere first; otherwise, I fear, they will be turned off to Gilberto and bossa nova altogether."
2,The editor should have cut 100 pages.,"Will Alexander, one of Santa Fe's most successful lawyers, is asked to represent four members of an infamous motorcycle gang during a murder trial. The prosecutor is positive these four gang members conducted a gangland murder. Will Alexander's instinct tells him that his clients are innocent.The basic storyline is interesting, but the author should have told his story in less than 300 pages. The novel drones on and on. Several times I was tempted to put the book aside and start a new book."
5,Tosh,"Oto is, by far, Fluke's best album. The music is deep and moody, the sounds clever and unique. As far as style goes, it's mellow, the closest work Fluke has to ambient. Bullet, Okay, Setback, and Freak all have wonderful music, Squirt sounds like something alien, while Tosh and Cut stand out for their own lyrical merits."
3,Only for the Dedicated,"I am sure it is valuable, but I would not have bought it if I knew what I was getting. Table after table of statistics with little text. I cannot put it high on my list of recommended books on World War II, except for the dedicated scholar in this particular subject."
1,Don't loose the software CD!,"If you happen to loose the software CD, this becomes a very expensive paperweight. Panasonic won't provide anything but ""updates"" to the software (no driver even!) at their website or when ""chatting"" with a support representative. They are sincerely sorry for the ""inconvenience"" this causes (making the device useless). Buy from a company that cares about its customers."
2,"panasonic, voice recorder,","The sound quality is not good. The scroll dial is not easy to deal with. The volume function is very touchy. It is located in the center dial and it's also used to ""stop"". It's almost like a ""joystick"", so if you are not careful, you are constantly turning unit on and off instead of lowering or raising the volume. I have had many voice recorders, and although I like the ease and capability it has to save on the computer, I like the Sony product much better for sound quality and ease of use."
5,One of my favorite recordings!,"These performances are surprisingly good, much better than those by many ""big name"" artists on full-price labels. Virtually every aspect of the recording is impeccable, from orchestral phrasing and textures, to pacing, to the balance between soloist and orchestra. Jando's tone is clear and liquid, and he is obviously THINKING about what the music is trying to say. The flawless integration between soloist and orchestra speaks very well for conductor Ligeti, and I would guess that more rehearsal time went into this production than on some other recordings. Engineering is exceptional, with a nice balance between direct and reverberant sound. CAVEAT: I am NOT a fan of ""original"" instruments, and those who are may prefer to look elsewhere."
4,"Interesting read, shipped promptly...","The condition of this book was accurate, and I received it promptly. Being able to see the book and read from it was a key factor in my deciding to buy it. I would consider buying from this seller again."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"I loved Cherly Strayed book titled ""Wild""! I thought for sure I would like this one as well...not so much. I couldn't get into the characters"
3,Well written but very bleak.,"It's a well written book but it's a too bleak, depressing and tragic. I am 3/4 through the book and hoping for a happy ending."
2,Same story as Wild,"This is a well written and compelling book. However, if you have read ""Wild"" - you have already read this book. Same story, same theme, same Mother-Daughter and family conflicts. Sometimes the author's writing style gets on my nerves a bit. But all in all, read this book first (before ""Wild"") and it is enjoyable."
5,Uplifting synopsis of what it means to trust God.,"This is one of the most inspiring ""little"" books I've read to date. Pamela Reeve, in one or two sentences per page, reveals the true meaning of Faith in God. It is a ""must read"" for Christians. Need a gift for that person who has everything? This small, inexpensive book, has the potential to change lives and will be a treasure to the recipient. I know. A friend gave me my copy."
5,Vet Prescribed for our dogs,"Our vet prescribed Bene-Bac for our Poms, who are both prone to intestinal problems. It worked very well for them, but cost us $20/ea from the Vet! When we found them here at Amazon we were thrilled.The dogs get a 1g dose every other day, and haven't had any problems since we started using them. We would highly recommend Bene-Bac Pet Gel. (It can be given to cats, too!)"
4,That's Mister Jordan Rudess to You!,"If you enjoy technical keyboard wizardry or think you might be interrested in what the heck that is then this is the CD for you. Jordan Rudess pulls out all the stops on this energetic progressive rock flavored album with the help of some top musicians. Terry Bozio adds his glorious drumming which really steps this up a notch IMHO. There is lots of fast playing, quick time changes and amazing keyboard work. Jordan even throws in a little ""game show"" patch will surely get a grin out of the listeners. If you buy this and like it, then I highly recommend another Jordan Rudess CD, Rythm of Time with Rod Morgenstern on the drums. Rod's playing is unbelievable on that album, not to mention Jordan smokes! I am a big fan of Dream Theater, Derk Sherinian, Dixie Dreggs, Rick Wakeman, Keith Emerson, and Mr. Jordan Rudess. - Ciao"
3,Nice Toy,It's a nice toy my 6 year old loves it but I think it's much more appropriate for a younger child. All in all she loves it and is having tons of fun examining her dolls and friends.
3,Eye Opener!,"Yeah, I have to admit that after hearing George Bush's amazing masterful speeches for 8 years (especially the outtakes) that everybody else sounds like an idiot! or is it the other way around. But what do I know I'm only a kid."
2,Thin read,I have been a subscriber for several years and this magazine gets smaller and smaller. I live in Atlanta an several of the recent issues have had little to no value for the zone 7 gardener.
2,Frustrated,One of the pages is missing. My daughter has to asked her friend to scan the page and sent it to her thru email.
5,great,I needed those book for a college history class of mine. I ordered it got it along with a few others and everything turned out great. Thanks.
5,Little Book Loaded With Info!,"This is a great little book! It's simple, to the point and gives practical advice on how to handle or reconstruct ones credit. The advice is easy and can be immediately incorporated into one's financial practices. It clears up misconceptions about credit shopping, using cash vs credit and how to interpret ones credit report. It specifically tells one how to increase their credit score.This is a great price. After I purchased the initial book, I purchased another for a gift and paid more than the listed price on Amazon. A good investment!"
4,Very good book of air combat for general readers,"This is a very good book covered the air combat history and tatics from WW1 to Gulf War. With charts and pictures, readers can find very usful information of the aircrafts, weapons, tatics plus background stories of each campaign and time period.Since this books covers a wide range of time line, this is good for general readers who want to get comprehensive knowledge of air combat or readeds who just start reading materials in this field. For those who have more knowledge of air combat, this may not be the best for more depth of each time period.Although with good coverage and materials, revision of typo is required if this book is going to be published again. Some of them are really obvious and may misdirected readers.For summary, this is a good book for general readers' collection."
4,An entertaining book for fans of air combat and tactics,"This is a very entertaining book for fans of aviation, air combat, and tactics to use in flight simulators. Lots of pictures and diagrams, printed on glossy paper, easy to understand and follow, this book is a good primer for those who are looking to improve their air combat skills in flight simulators. It follows the history of air combat from WW1 to today's modern jets, and for each conflict it highlights the tactics used by pilots as they match their plane against the enemy. Norman Franks selects particular dogfights in each war to serve as examples of how fighter pilots put their aircraft's strengths to good use when battling in the skies. Speed, maneuverability, guns, durability ... all of these are taken into account.This book knows its audience - mainstream America - and seeks to entertain and educate at the same time. Its a good book to keep around and appeals to fans of aviation of all ages."
5,Simply The Best !,I put headphones through torture either while working out in the gym or running the streets and normally go through a couple of sets a year. This product is comfortable to wear and has great sound quality but eventually through the bouncing I end up losing audio on one side and have to start with another pair. I'm guessing that an internal wire either breaks or the connection is somehow lost to one speaker. What I would like to see is a support on the wire connected to the earphone where the wires enter the unit to the side of the speaker frame which would alleviate that connection stress point and hopefully prevent the connection from being lost.I think these are a great item at a great price and I'll continue to use them as long as they're available or until I find a better product.
1,Porn Masquerading as Feminist Revenge,"The director uses devastating feminist revenge as the vehicle to deliver his porn which includes both male and female full frontal nudity. I guess the hypocritical feminist theme was supposed to negate the porn so you wouldn't notice it. Maybe you will get over this unhappy movie in a day or two, but I'm not sure."
4,Odd to call this a Best Of CD...,"This is essentially the first ELO album (known as ""No Answer"") minus ""Nellie Takes Her Bow"" and adds some early takes of songs from the first two albums.But... this disc sounds great! If you're a fan of early ELO or The Move this is the CD to get for the best sound quality just don't expect it to be a greatest hits album.The 2006 remaster of No Answer (besides the intrusive digital tape hiss removal) has a pinched upper midrange that makes it harsh sounding. This CD more resembles the amazing Harry T. Moss mastered UK vinyl.This CD was quite a treat for me to hear. 10538 Overture is free from the tape dropouts found on many of the Jet/Epic/Legacy reissues and hasn't been mutilated with Noise Reduction and heavy handed EQ work unlike the 2006 Peter Mew remaster.Very recommended!"
3,The Volkswagen of Tricycles:,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter, and I was hopeful, but she isn't ready to ride it.You must be aware of what you are getting though. Amazon's ad says that the trike has the free-wheeling option, it does not.I bought it because of the safety features and the free-wheeling option, which I found out when I got it, it didn't have. So it hurts my daughters foot and leg as the pedals spin. She is now a little intimidated by it. We will work through this eventually. The company I bought it from compensated me for Amazons false ad though."
4,Good Resource,"This is a good resource for children's church or sunday school crafts. Maybe they could expand the depth of bible stories by dividing it into 2 books, one for the old testament and one for the new testament."
3,Battery Life,I'd bought the Drill which came with two batteries 3 years ago. While the set has been invaluable and has completed every general task I needed it to I must've hit the point where the batteries won't hold the charge anymore. I'm now considering if it'd be best to get a higher quality set or just buy a new lower-end drill set.
3,Good recommendations but lacks detail on age groups,"This book offered a number of good selections, often books I would otherwise not have known about. I would have liked a more detailed breakdown of the recommended ages. For example, this books offers a list of recommended readings from ages 6-11 which covers a wide range, as does the range 10 and up. I would have preferred a more detailed breakdown of the appropriate age group."
5,Finlandia china,"Great buy for the price. One has to be careful, because the gravy boat is not attached to the plate."
1,This toy box does not hold up,"We bought this toy box and two days after unboxing it and putting it together, it broke. It appears to be ""glued"" together in some places and the glue did not hold. I have tried calling the company and the number is not current and the company's website says their ""Intellectual Rights"" are for sale. I am very disappointed."
1,"Basically, its junky","My son, and my niece both had this toy box...It is a pretty toy box and it held a lot of toys. We both had the same problem though, the lid broke off the hinges. My sons got thrown away, and my sister just ripped off the hinges and lid and uses it for dress up clothes. Its sad that they didnt last long. They were just junky. I am looking for a new toybox, and will probably get a big plastic one. I dont think I would go for a wood one again."
1,Turgid and prolix tour of a politically correct swamp,"Ms. Jagose does as well as can be expected in explaining a ""discipline"" that is anything but. A strong point of her tour of this academic freakery is in making it clear how the overwhelmingly male queer population came to be the caboose on the train of radical feminism. Those with the endurance to complete this introduction will understand why queer theory is the phlogiston of the social sciences. A more concise and less arcane view of some of the same terrain can be had in Leo Bersani's ""Homos,"" also available from Amazon.com."
3,"Smells great, not so clean",I love the fact that this is so compact - and my clothes smell so good. Unfortunately it does not seem to get my whites as clean as Tide HE. So I will be using this for colors and the Tide for whites. I have a Whirlpool HE front loader.
5,Magnificent!!!!!!!!,A WONDERFUL read. It brings tears because of similar experiences. Steve seems real and it's as if he's there and your friend. Your troubled yet trusting friend who's always there to lead. Even if it's down the wrong path. A brutal but brilliant story that touches the heart andd leaves a smile in the end.
1,Terrible,"One of the worst books I've ever read. There was really no plot, just some really messed up and retarded kid writing in a journal, rambling about his horrible life. He does alot of dumb things but never learns from his mistakes. It then ends suddenly, before we learn whether he ever gets out of rehab or makes up with his father. It's a terrible book with no depth or focus to it."
4,Betty Lou is a Hoot,I enjoyed all of these movies but Betty Lou is just what most women feel like at times. Glossed over and subhuman. She did the part very well but the best scene is in the bathroom. What a hoot! Gross Anatomy and Betsy's Wedding are fun films too but Betty Lou does rock.
1,didn't fit,Purchased as replacement for an old one I had. This new model -- ankle too tight and instep too big -- returned both.
1,Technically flawed,"On my initial reading I was fairly impressed by this book. However as I read more detailed, technical accounts of the time period O'Connell covers I began to see large holes in his theory. His biggest failing is treating the battleship's rivals (torpedeos and aircraft) as technological constants. In actuality both required extensive development before they had any chance of rivaling the battleship as potentially decisive weapons. To look at one example, O'Connell condemns the US Navy for failing to pursue the concept of a torpedo armed capital ship. He neglects to mention the fact that the torpedo of the time was short ranged and that the fear of the Navy was that a faster enemy could simply stay out of torpedo range and sink the torpedo battleship with long range gunfire. In addition, the torpedoes would have weakened the hull structure of the ship making it easier to destroy."
2,Poor Connection,"After using it three times, the music started cutting out. On the forth time Using it, my Sansa e260 would not play at all. When I jiggled my sansa, thinking it was not plugged in all the way to the transmitter, the music cut in & out. The transmitter was not making good enough contact with my MP3. I know it's not the MP3, because when I plug it in to charge through my computer, it works fine."
2,This thing Blows,"Well, I bought this thing hoping it would be what I needed...when I got it it looked great! Very pleasing to the eyes, and fit my cupholder great. Unfortunately, my Sansa doesn't stay docked in it so well. The sansa constantly comes unsecured from the dock, thus the music cutting out. On smooth roads, it's great, and functions well. Throw in some curvey roads, or some bumps, and it pops out every time. I'd gladly sell it for cheap if someone wants it."
3,Sansa Cup Holder,It doesn't seem to work without connecting a wire from the sansa audio out to the audio in plug on the FM Transmitter. I guess the bottom connector for charging doesn't have the capability to transmit the sound.The product works fairly well. It's nice to have something that sits in the cupholder easily and can charge the sansa while you're listening and driving.
2,Boring,"I bought this disc because I thought it was going to have more Popeye cartoons. But it is, in my opinion very boring and old. The best one is the first episode of Popeye, the rest are pretty lame."
4,An Insightful and Timeless Reference Tool,"This book is a refreshing reminder to convert the well crafted (often times static) business plan into a results oriented action plan. As a Senior Vice President of a top 10 US financial services organization, it is paramount that I create a business plan which is reviewed and modified frequently to ensure critical performance measures are achieved. ""ON TARGET"" offers easy to understand and implement review techniques which ensure positive results. It offers a relevent and reliable process to help monitor and control desireed outdomes. I highly recommend it."
1,The best advice regarding this book,"This is the best advice I can give; If you want to read the book either get it from the library or buy it for under $5. This is not a book you will need to or want to read again. You can read all the other well written negative comments, I will not repeat the same points here. If every wife of a Mafioso wrote a book there would be a book written every minute. Anyone who gives this book 5 stars is probably not reading the book for its information on the Mafia but simply interested on the ""woman"" perspective of it and probaly watch the Life time channel. I am not saying there is anything wrong with that just tring to explain why this book would be given 5 stars. These are the same people that probably found Mafia Marriage highly exciting."
2,Self Serving Mafia Wife,I did not find this book as enjoyable as I had hoped. I think the author was very slanted and presented her side of the story in a self serving way. Really a disappointment.
5,Grate!! Powerfull !! We can be satisfied with it.,"This is grate for Cardio and toning.3 workouts,each 15mins.I can be satisfied with it.It is very hard for doing all of those EX.at the same time. I'm very sweat but feeling good and can get rid of stress.I have a lot of workout video.This is my most favorit one!!"
1,Confused martial arts,"I did not like this workout because: 1) One of the guys is not with the others, 2) Her accent was hard to understand, 3) The cuing was not good, 4) The changes were very abrupt, 5) It felt short cardio-wise and long interest-wise."
3,Chaotic,"The workout was more or less a forum for the Barbie-like instructor to show off. The movements, while different from what I'm used to seeing in an exercise video and effective, changed so suddenly that not even her group could keep up with her. Additionally, I expected more ""boot camp"" exercises but only saw a few push-ups thrown in here and there. Overall I found it too chaotic to enjoy. I purchased this video, then went back and exchanged it for another one."
4,"Great advice, unreadable type","Theodore Rees Cheney is a favorite guide for improving my writing. This book is another great example of his sound advice, relevant examples, and useful exercises. But the type size is so small and faint I had to use a magnifier to read it and the decorative flourishes on each page quickly become an annoying distraction. Shame on the publisher for diminishing such a good work. 5 stars for the content; zero stars for the page design."
4,Not a good Kindle Book,"I got this book first time around on my Kindle. Right off the bat, I realized I had made a mistake by purcahsing the book on my Kindle. This is the kind of book that you want to read and read and reread, you want to read it with a highlighter and make notes in the margin. After the first few pages I realized taht I had to buy the real thing so went back to Amazon and ordered the DTB. Now it sits on my desk as a valuable tool for every manuscript that I write."
5,"A must for writers--and, no you probably haven't seen advice offered in this book elsewhere","I first saw a copy of this book, and then I quickly put it aside as I thought I'd already seen most of its content elswewhere. Wrong! It is a highly instructive book on what to do and what to avoid in writing. That said there seem to be millions of pointers, so in that respect, all that is covered is overwhelming. Still, if you are a writer or want to be one, you need this book on you shelf--and then you need to read it all the way through at least once a year. I now read it on my city bus trips back and forth to work, little bits at a time because of the detail. Actually, I plan to make it the only book I read for the next several months on by bus trips to and from work. Maybe what I learn will finally push me to the level I've always aspired to reach--after devoting my entire adult life (like 50 years now) to writing.Good book. Get it."
5,"""Bittersweet Swing""","I was intrigued by a review of this CD prior to listening to it; ""Stranger in Town, characterized by its bittersweet swing,"" the review said. That's a great way to describe this CD - wonderful, beautiful, swing, jazz. By far, the Best Jazz CD of the year!"
3,What about the REAL story?,"Carrieri knew what these guys were REALLY like, but, unfortunately, chose to write a tome of such sticky-sweetness, it defies belief! DiMaggio, etc., were not evil men, but they weren't the gods Carrieri paints them as: they were flawed (in some cases, morally and ethically, and deeply so) -- and they would've been the first to tell you that! Had Carrieri told us the REAL STORY -- how these very imperfect, very human men dealt with the pressures, thier fears and demons, on and off the field, this would've been a great book! Unfortunately, he wimped out! He does DiMaggio - nor us - any favours by putting him on a pedistal!"
5,thank you for writing this book,"Thank you to Morton Kondracke for writing this book. My mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease two years ago. Morton and Milly's story is heart-wrenching and I appreciate them sharing it with the world. It was difficult to read in that I cried and cried, but it inspired me to try and do more early on in the progression of my mother's disease. God bless the Kondracke family."
4,Saving Milly,"Book was used one, but well preserved. Price was just right.Saving Milly was a heart breaking real life story. Had to draw paralelswith my story spouse has Parkinson's for last 10 years."
1,Badly written book by self-absorbed author,Kondracke's book is more about him and politics in Washington than it is about what it's like to have a wife with Parkinson's Disease. He commits the fatal writer's error of telling about feelings and reactions rather than letting the reader discover them. He and his wife are very unappealing people. The writing style is tedious. Not worth the price or the time it takes to read it. Very disappointing.
2,The other playsets are a better buy,"I bought my daughter multiple playsets for Christmas from the LPS series. Round round pet town was vy far a more sturdy set and has more to do. THe hampster run on top of this set did not accurately fit and we were unable to put any animals inside or even get it securely fastened. Personally, I feel there are better built sets than this one, and this one has the least amount to do as far as pretend play goes."
5,Keeps the little animal lovers busy for hours,"My eight-year-old daughter just loves animals and the Littlest Pet Shop line is her newest favorite. She saved her own money for this playhouse and was not disappointed. It comes with a dalmation, fish and hamster and all kinds of cute little accessories. Seems quite durable. We're planning a Littlest Pet Shop birthday party and wanted to suggets the Usborne book ""Making Models"" as a creative complement to these cute toys. They hava a mini-garden project that will work beautifully with the pets."
4,Satisified Customer-GBB,"My son saw this on TV and asked for it as a gift. I was somewhat reluctant since it appears to be a girls toy. It has kept him occupied for hours and enjoys playing with the pet shop. You need to buy the additional ""pets"" dogs, cats, turtles, gerbils, turtles, ect to really make this fun. My son is 6 years"
1,No Ferret - Major Disappointment,The description on the Amazion site promoted the inclusion of the bobblehead ferret - a much coveted creature by my 4-year old niece. On Christmas Day we discovered that the set did not include the ferret as advertised.
5,This Toy is .............,Great! Very Good Toy for all ages. We really Enjoy the cute little puppies and they interact with you. I disagree with the person above though. The toy is portable. I bring it to my Grandma's house all the time and it never breaks! The only thing wrong with the toy is that it is not as big as i expected.
4,Littlest Pet Shop,"My kids had to have this toy, they just love it. Nothing has broken, even with my kids fighting over it, my kids are 6yrs old twins. It folds up small enough to take to grandma's house, but we do put the pieces in a smaller bag to carry."
2,All These People are TRIPPING!!,"I got this CD en lieu of the highly favorable reviews posted here. And it's whack whack whack. maxi wishes he could rap. There are only two good songs on the CD (yeah, THOSE two) Buy an underground mix tape you people. Get an idea of what real electronic dance music is. Avoid this nonsense like the plague."
3,"Ok, but not what I expected.","This toybox does hold a LOT of toys, and is fully ready to use when it arrives at your house. However, i ASSUMED the lid was hinged. Its not. My one year old can't get into his toys. I have to leave the lid off because it will hit his head or smash his fingers if I leave it on. The lid just sort of sets on top of the box. I probably wouldn't have bought this had I looked at it in person. The colors do match his room perfectly. He is still to short to reach anything unless it is on the top."
3,Solid AV Dock KeySpan,"I have been looking for a simple, rugged AV dock for several years. Having expended my time and money on junk at eBay, I came across this little gem. Does everything you could expect and more. Seems like it would last a while as the connection point is fairly solid. Charges the iPod and gives you remote access to your tunes. Oh yeah, the remote is fantastic. I can be clear across the room, not even point the remote in the docking direction, and it still works great."
2,Not worth the price.,We liked the style of this set. We were looking for a nice reasonably priced set for a long time. We decided to buy this. Not worth the hassle. The finish was marred and painted over to hide the scrapes. It also looked like the items had hand prints and dirt marks and it was in its original UNOPENED packaging. The last straw was that the table leg screw came out and was placed in with what looked like wood putty. Its going back. The saving grace for this item was that it is cute.
1,Don't waste your time!,"I picked this book up for a good vacation read as I like thrillers/mysteries. Although there were some good parts, as a whole this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The character were not well developed, I could have cared less about the whiny lead character by the end of the book, loose threads left hanging, etc. I read it until the end thinking it HAD to get better but with no luck. I could go on and on but the bottom line was that I actually threw the book away after reading it."
1,Disappointing and disgusting.,"I read Strong's second novel The Death Pit before I started The Poison Tree and I really liked it. And I'll admit that at first I liked this one as well.I read it with interest right up until the big climactic scene when the whole plot fell apart. The solution made very little sense to me- it almost seemed as though the author had just tacked it on at the last minute to have an ending- any ending! That leads to a thoroughly disgusting and nauseating spate of animal cruelty that I find unforgivable. The author seems to be hoping that these atrocities will make the reader forget that the so-called solution to his mystery was ludicrous and wholly unbelievable. It didn't work- I was so furious by the end that I vowed never to read anything else by Mr. Strong. That's unfortunate because as I stated before, I did like The Death Pit. Makes me wish that I'd never looked for The Poison Tree."
1,The worst unreadable tripe,"This is a terrible book that could had potential. Arguably women in antarctica have as much interest and stories to share as men. Unfortunatly this author, an unabashed feminist, just lists lots of boring facts and petty acheivements of women. Do we really care who the first women who swore at the south pole was? Or the first women to smoke a cigarrette at the pole? No. A terrible book, useless tripe, hateful."
5,Really Good Flute!,"I have several very expensive handmade wooden Native American Flutes. I find that the sound quality of this flute is comparable, and having a flute that you don't have to worry so much about is great! The tone is very consistent, and the flute is quite playable. Since it is a six-hole flute it is much more versitile than the 5-hole versions offered by many manufacturers."
4,Casino Play,"This Video concentrates alot on the ""Etiquette"" of playing in a live game. It also covers playing position and some other very basic concepts. It is a good video for a total novice or someone who has never played live before. The price is a little much for this information as there isn't alot of stratagy here. Ed Miller's video cover stratagy very well."
4,A DECENT VALUE,"Good sound for the price. Arrived very quickly from Amazon. A little bit larger than I anticipated. Because of the type of connecting speaker wires, there are limitations on how far the speakers and sub-woofer can be from the main system. I would have preferred to place my speakers farther apart, but couldn't. Also, most functions are done through the remote. Which means....NEVER LOSE THE REMOTE! The sound is quite good and having a 5-CD changer is a pleasure. Being able to change a CD while the others are playing is a good feature. It's fairly easy to operate once you get used to using the remote for everything. I had it all hooked up and playing in no time. A decent value for the money."
2,Poor quality version of a classic,"There's a reason that this CD is priced so low. My low rating has nothing to do with the material itself, but the poor quality audio. Welles's outstanding oratory skills and clever sound effects are overwhelmed by the low levels of the vocal track combined with an unrelenting hiss. The CD isn't even good for ""old-timey"" atmosphere, since *in between* the words of the original program they seemingly removed noise so there is a kind of ""stutter"". It's like listening to the show over a bad voice-activated radio circuit. Underwater.By all means, get this classic recording. Just get it in a better, cleaned-up version. This CD is no bargain."
2,one track mind,"This is a wonderful original of the 1930's classic, but who in their right mind puts 60 minutes of recording on a CD and makes ONLY ONE TRACK? If you miss any portion of the ""show"", you have to start the whole thing from the beginning, there's no going back. Each of the pauses could have been made into a track break so that you can listen to the story at your own pace and not have to start over with the same drone if the kids, telephone, doorbell or any one of a million other distractions come about to prevent you listening to the whole thing, totally, in one sitting. Do not get this unless you have one full hour of completely dedicated time to listen, with NO distractions. Otherwise you will listen to Orson Welles and the orchestra about a million times before you can get the whole show."
4,It was for my father. I didn't listen to it.,"My dad said it's good, and the first side is better than the second. This began a conversation about the career of H.G. Wells."
3,"This book is really about Audrey Santo of Worcester, Ma","This is really about Audrey Santo of Worcester, Ma. I would say it reeks of plagiarsm. I did enjoy it and felt I was really reading about Audrey's family."
5,Read this book ( if you can find it......!),"I found this book at a used bookstore, it was signed ""To Omer From Elsa, Christmas 1923"". If you are lookin' for answers that you just can't find today, this is the book. You will not find any illustrations in this book. That's not what this book is about. This book is about the questions that someone living in the 1900's might ask (i.e. ""How to blue a rifle barrel"" to ""How to make hard tack"" to ""How to cure the the mange"".) Amazon has found a reprint of this book and I suggest you buy it, you don't find a book like this everyday (I bought a copy to keep from wearing mine out). ""Of course this book isn't for everybody""(i.e. If you don't understand the importance of this, you deserve what you get)."
1,Not satisfied,This was a christmas gift for my parents to replace their old one. It was not good quality. They said it felt and looked like a child's set. My parents will probably return it and buy something else. I do not recommend this product.
4,I thought this product was superior to all ...,I thought this product was superior to all other methods I've tried. The whole bag of ice thing usually doesn't work for us; it's way too messy. The Ace Instant Cold Compress works great. No mess! No hassle!! Just open the package and it's ready to go. I think this would definitely be a great thing to keep in the car or first aid kit for those unexpected accidents! Definitely two thumbs up!
2,I had problems with this product. I wasn't ...,"I had problems with this product. I wasn't able to squeeze and break the liquid bubble with my hands, so I used a hammer. I was concerned about the safety of doing this. The product did get very cold and stay cold for a long time, and could conform well to my body. I can see how this product would be good for a cold compress away from home, but it needs to be easier to activate."
4,Great technical book,"This is a great book if you want the technical side of giving birth. I originally bought the book to give to a young mother to help her understand what to expect in regards to weight gain, nutrition, how she will know she is going into labor, etc. This book does not go into these things, however, it was a beautifully illustrated book for someone that is going into the medical field of birthing. So I did give it to my daughter and she found it fascinating."
2,Not worth buying,"Having seen Lennart Nielsen's book a few years back, I was expecting to get something of even better quality now. Instead, the book just feels somehow more intimidating to me than Nielsen's book. Maybe the pictures are too big? Not real enough? They don't carry the information I would want, and almost nothing is explained in text either."
1,The binding is very bad.,Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad. Pages are falling out!
3,Pretty to look at-hard to fly,Under powered for the size of plane it is. The NiMh batteries don't hold much of a charge .Maybe I just got a bum set! Not very likely that there were two bad batteries in thr same kit. I still have not had it in the air for more than a minute. I wish I had bought a Radian from ParkZone for a hundred dollars more.
1,Has errors,"This is not a good book. I checked it out of the library so I could go through the questions in every chapter. The first one I did was the fractions pretest and their answer to question 13 is wrong. The question is 5 2/5 + 2 3/8. Every way I did it my answer was 7 31/40 which isn't even close to their answer of 2 26/95. I did it over a bunch of times and finally just punched the question as is into the calculator and it still said 7 31/40 was correct. I don't know how many other errors are in the book since I quit using it after that. The best book I know of is Barron's Math The Easy Way, Fourth Edition so use that one instead.This has to be the same book I am using. It says Arco Master the GED Mathematics, 2nd Edition, Copyright 2003. The difference is that the cover is different and it goes to 398 pages including appendix not 280."
2,Good but lose something,This album is ok but losed something from last album. Still its got some songs and the sweet melodics but too smooth and need rough edge. A bit of a let down sorry.
5,golf ball display case,I like the affordability and quality of this item. It displays my collection of golf balls nicely.
5,Required material fits the bill!,Great package for Organic Chemistry. I would recommend it to anyone who is taking Organic Chemistry whose professor lists it as required.
3,Don't try to be too much,"This book definitely tries to be too much: A bit of Thriller, some Psychologoy, Philosophy, Literature, etc. And this is unfortunate, as Harrison definitely is a good writer: Porter Wren, Hobbs and Cynthia are good characters and the description of New York is great.The plot is a bit a mess, but sometimes the narrative is strong enough to cover it up and it has enough drive to keep you going.If the editor had done a better job and shortened this book by 80 to 100 pages - very often Porter Wren is just rambling on about stuff, nothing to do with the story and not very insightful -, it could have been a slick yuppie thriller!If it's sitting in your bookcase (as in my case), read it. If not, don't bother to hunt it down."
1,Not Recommended,"I must admit being bored by this book. The writing was good but seemed very deliberate and rather overblown, irritating with name dropping, unnecessarily heavy on sex scenes, and an incredibly weak ending. I found myself nearly quitting several times thinking of all the other really good books waiting on my shelves. Instead it was one I could have not started and not missed."
4,Lighten up already,"While nothing can hope to surpass Queen's original, Electric Six's cover is respectable though admittedly not wholly inspired, and I actually consider the video to be not disrespectful but (gasp!) an affectionate and appropriately cheeky homage to Frederick (Farokkh) Bulsara, aka Freddie Mercury. I think Freddie -- in his own absurdist, over-the-top style -- would have approved. To go off making accusations of homophobia smacks of self-righteous PC and is seriously missing the point (if the previous review is a reference to their song ""Gay Bar"", which is actually quite fun and tongue-in-cheek ... even one of my gay friends is a big fan). Electric Six are still one of the few bands making it safe for rockers and dancers, gays and straights alike to unite and start nuclear war on the dance floor!"
3,A Surprise,"Starman is probably the most popular superhero comic book with adults who liked comics when they were kids. If this fits you, read the book. It manages to be a 90's comic book (much more intelligent than they were in your youth) and makes references to comics of the 40's-60's. This is the second collection. Check out the first, Starman: Sins of the Father."
1,Travel and culture guide,"Some good information, and lots of enthusiasm for the USA, but some really serious inaccuracies in most areas. For example, the author says that ""A degree from one of the eight 'Ivy League' (private) universities ... comes at a cost - about $37,000 for a four-year degree."" (page 89). Thirty seven thousand dollars would not buy a single year at any of the Ivys. There are a number of other inaccuracies. I would be very careful about using this book as a guide to behavior and customs in the USA."
4,A decent book,"Though it is much more difficult to write a book about a practice a that is as vague as teaching second language, (as compared to theory), this book is helpful to those that have a few synapses left and who have not burned themselves out with too much pot or booze. I both teach EFL and research a the university level second language acquisition, and my educational background is applied linguistics. This book gave me some ideas for avenues of inquiry, and I have read it and decided to keep it on my library shelves.One hint to book reviewers: It matters not whether you criticize or compliment a book, but what does matter is how you make your argument. I suggest that one study some examples of reviews, and realize that even when the reviewer is adamant about their disagreement with the text, they do not use profane language or insinuation. The successful reviewer does use accepted norms of writing, and do not personally attack the author.ADT"
2,"Good for older women, not for younger women","The Method: T'Ai ChiClaire Hooton is a beautiful older woman and the host. While she seems to ""know her stuff"" I found the instruction unpleasing. I think it would be great for older adults looking to learn T'ai Chi at home but not for younger people. It's geared toward older women.It's also an older video. While it has 2002, 2008 as the copyright dates, it looks like it was filmed in the mid 90's. If you would prefer something more recent and geared toward younger people, don't get this DVD. However, if you are an older woman, this may be perfect for you!"
1,offensive,"This is not a good book for children, since the author (in the early 1900's) wrote an offensive caricature of the dark-skinned man of African descent. The publisher placed a disclaimer on the title page."
3,Useful,"For all of you who were assigned to read this (I'm a German major and have to read this auf Deutsch) and have no idea what it says or means then read this-for free. Save your cash on your fun purchases (holds her beloved Kindle closer in adoration)! Hopefully, for you German majors, this will help you get an idea of WHAT is happening in the text with also those archaic words. I would also suggest that when you go abroad for your language requirement to purchase an old German dictionary because modern dictionaries typically don't include those words that have become obsolete.At this point in time I hope to read this and then decipher the selection from this in the original German I have to translate and understand for my German Literature class. I can only be thankful that as we reach contemporary writing the writing becomes less grandiloquent and easier to understand-unlike the second book of Faustus.-Dani.p.s.So yes, buy it while it's hot and it's still a freebie."
1,The Road to Serfdom,"Everybody who read this book should read ""The Road to Serfdom"" afterwards. Here, the winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics F. Hayek takes apart the Philosophy propagated by K. Marx and other socialists, and shows that collectivism without exception must lead to the loss of personal freedom and wellbeing. Read it, it is an easy to read political (not economic) book, and it will change your outlook. It even may make you an individualist."
3,informative,This is a must read for those paying attention to the political climate in America and internationally as well as the social problems plaguing society. Unfortunately too many of the goals set forth in this manifesto have been stealthily achieved and now have led to the destruction of the American experiment that gave so many people around the world hope and opportunity to achieve their dreams.
3,As History or As a Book?,"If one looks at this book as a work that altered history, then one would have to say it is a great book. Not many can say they wrote a book that had a profound affect on human existence. However, if one is reviewing it as a literary work by an author, one would have to recognize that the writer of the book forgets his premise is flawed and proven over and over through history that communism just won't work as an economic policy or social philosophy. To fail to recognize the historical record is lacking a certain personal quality, to say the least. Today, a book like this would not likely be accepted for publication unless a clear and unique reason was given as to why this model of economy would work when others nearly identical did not. But then again, it only took one person using the book like a manual to make a difference on a global scale. The effects of which we still see today."
4,The Communist Manifesto,i never read this but always wanted to. It was great to be able to have it on my kindle.
4,Enjoyed but am unsure of the translation,"It was interesting to read this often vilified text but I'm unsure of the translation. There is some English colloquium that seems a bit out of place. Of course, this is the only version I have read."
2,Beware: This is not the edition advertised,"I ordered what Amazon then represented as the Penguin edition of the ""Manifesto"" with an introduction by Gareth Stedman Jones. What I received was a Penguin ""Great Ideas"" edition (a cheaper alternative with a poor binding and no introduction whatever.) If you are specifically looking for the Stedman Jones intro, you will be disappointed. Amazon has since accepted some of my suggestions for revising this listing, but if you search by GSJ's name, this item still turns up, so my warning still applies. (By the way, though it is not indicated in the book's title or the product description, the edition I received happens also to contain ""The 18th Brumaire..."" This, however, hardly makes up for the absence of the introduction which was my reason for ordering the book in the first place.)"
1,A Bunch Of Drivel Accepted As Great Thinking.,"This book is one of the worst written in history, not just because of the results it has had on humanity, but because it is crappy writing. I can't stand to hear people say that this is a classic, for whatever reason. It was written by a bum who had a host of illegitimate children, and then put them in orphanages so as to not have his reputation as an ""intellectual"" damaged. And you people think this is great writing??? Please, get off the crack!"
1,Not even close,This guy was obviously out of touch with reality. The problem is if I work hard and buy something for myself then it's mine I own it. Whether an activist a scoundrel or the government try to take the ownership away from me without my consent that is by definition a thief.
1,It was an advocate of Wellfare and the innovator of sloth.,"Really. if Karl Marx had any guts, he woiuld have advocated the working man's form of economics, Capitalism. This ""idea"" of communism, it is totally possible, I'll grant you that, but plausible? I think not. Any person fwho advocates communism likes the idea of letting other people work while they reap in the benefits, but in reality, the people who woiuld actually be doing the work would not let the system work, they would ask for justice. I mean, if you busted your hump all day long and only got 1/2 of the benefits, while your beer-swigging-drug-using-Next-door neighbor got the rest, what would that make you think? In all I think that this ""communist manifesto"" is well written but is vouching for all the wrong ideas."
5,Lessons in what NOT to be,"Marx, though poverty stricken his whole life, managed to squeeze out some very good reading. Reading this and Das Kapital makes a person wonder if Marxism were truly imbedded in our culture today, would even be allowed to read it.... Makes one think..."
5,WORLD SHAKER,"I read Marx's political tract mainly because it ranks up with other books, such as Darwin's Origin of Species, the Bible, or Freud, as books that influenced and changed the world. Marx really gets the reader moved, and injects the reader with a passion to rise against the bourgeoisie, or the capitalist. The language is amazing, and no doubt each word followed to the literal T by some proponents that have also moved the world, notably Mao Zedong and V.I. Lenin. This book is highly recommended, because, now, it is a relatively IMMORTAL piece of work (no, not immoral!)."
3,"Short, but not very easy to read.","The appeal to me was the fact that this manifesto was so popular and well known, yet I had never read it. In truth, I was hoping for some sort of insight into the communist theory and possibly a little help in uderstanding the ideology and methods. What I got instead was a rant in high chant that was next to impossible to understand.Thinking about it further, I realized that the name of the book does include the word ""manifesto"" so I should have known. I dont regret purchasing the book, as Marx does have some calmer moments. One in particular where he relays some basic ground rules for a communist revoloution. Interesting reading (at least some of it). I would reccomend it if you are interested in knowing how Marx felt about communisim, but if you want to know more about the political/social movement itself, buy something else."
1,Very very hard read,I liked karl marx passion for what he saw and how he wanted to change things for the better.But he was not a man of his time every solution of his is totally wrong.Too bad cause he seemed to care about people and hate the injustices he saw.He just did not have the correct idea of how to solve it.
2,Just not that good,"I guess you had to be there. The ""book"" (really more a pamphlet) makes a lot of time-specific references that today's common person will not be familiar with. What's the difference between French and German socialists of the 19th century? History buffs may know, but I certainly do not. Stuff like this makes the read very dry and boring.Another major gripe is that you can sum up the whole thing with about two sentences and the infamous list: ""The proletariat are always getting exploited by the bourgoise. {Insert 10 point plan} UNITE AND REVOLT!"" There, I just saved you 2 hours."
3,Too simple,"Interesting ideas, but it oversimplified human nature and human history and devalues human life and experience, and ultimately sabotaged its own point."
3,"Some great insights, but a tough read","Karl Marx was a great thinker; this is probably not in dispute. He was very prescient on the evolution of industrialized society (e.g., gradually becoming more secular). What happened to the inevitable rise of the proletariat? Well, I don't think Marx could have foreseen that the bourgoisie would gain control of the mass media, nor what powerful forms that media would take. This is the way the bourgoisie continue their control.Even though this book isn't long (only 90 pages including several forewards written by Engels), it would be tough for most people to digest in one sitting. I'll probably go back and re-read parts later. Still, it's interesting to read the basis for communism; you can then come to your own conclusions as to why it ""failed""."
4,Amor caribe,"Lo primero que me sorprendió de la más reciente novela de García Márquez fue su extensión: apenas supera las cien páginas; Memoria de mis putas tristes es una novela corta que se lee de un tirón, de un sólo suspiro como las primeras novelas de Gabo, atrás quedaron complicados universos como Macondo para darle paso a la vida sin mayores eventos de un romántico que a los noventa años comienza una década en la que ya quizás no sea un amante fogoso, pero en la que por fin conoce el amor. Hermosa historia que se siente tan Caribe que a pesar de la diferencia de edad entre el amante y la amada, en lugar de ser una historia sórdida o maldita, inspira una profunda ternura y la inmensa nostalgia de sentirse enamorado con la ilusión que sólo se conoce con el primer amor."
2,Un crimen disfrazado de amor,"Gabriel García Marquez es mi autor favorito y a través de los años he disfrutado como ataca todo tipo de temas, aun los mas controversiales, con mucho éxito. Pero en este libro no pude superar el asco en pensar en una relación entre un viejo de 90 años y una joven virgen. A mis 43 años me da asco pensar el compartir una cama con un viejo consumido por un deseo fisico y sexual. Es simplemente un crimen en las sociedades de hoy en dia el tener relaciones físicas con una menor de edad. Es un acto que no tiene excusa ninguna. El libro no me logra convencer de la pureza de tal relación y el protagonista nunca se ganó ni mi simpatía ni respeto. El pobre es un perdedor buscando salvar su patética e inútil vida con la presencia de un alma pura e inocente. Aun cuando disfruté mucho del diálogo y la narración, no pude superar el sentido de asco en pensar en el protagonista."
1,Still waiting,"One year delivery purchased on 05/09/2009. First issue not yet received, as of 06/10/2009. Payment goes at Internet speed on the Amazon Web site, and I am not sure why the latest issue (dated July and available in store early June) could not be sent right away by KitPlanes."
3,Good werewolf sighting book,"This is a book om werewolf sightings but also includes possible bigfoots,shapechangers, and ghostwerewolfs for lack of a better term"
4,This Was Lock The Doors & Windows Creepy!,"This book of ""true sightings"" by apparently normal, sober people scared me to death! One of those ""glad hubby is home tonight"" books. Some of it drags a bit (why it got 4 stars instead of 5) but the stories for the most part are truly creepy. The one that got to me (spoiler alert!) was where a woman was driving down a dark road and comes upon a person walking on the side of the road. Happens to everyone all the time right? Well as she passed the walker turned and looked at her and gave her a big werewolf snarl from a snout full of teeth. Seems the walker was your typical ""Manwolf"". Yikes.If you like werewolves this book is worth a read."
1,Pass,I really dislike this toy. The keys and locks are nearly impossible for my child to use and she gets very frustrated. I'm glad this was a gift but am completely baffled at how many lame toys are produced. Don't they have focus groups for this kind of item? We hate it. Do not buy.
3,Great toy,This toy provides a safe way for children to play with keys. The animal shapes fit through most openings even if it is not the correct space. The trapezoid key is especially tricky for my two year old to get in the hole. Typically a key is inserted vertically. This key needs to be inserted horizontally which is very challenging.
4,Fun,"It's a fun adn decent version of Babe Ruth's life. John Goodman made a really great Babe Ruth. He had a childlike approach to everything, but still was the gritty old school ball player."
3,Language....,too much questionable language. was supposed to be a gift for a kid. would have been a better movie without it.
3,Okay Movie,"This movie is one hour and fifty-five minutes long. At least this movie is better then The Babe Ruth Story. William Bendix played the Babe in that one. Though the film does take liberty with the truth, it does try to stay on track. The Babe Ruth Story comes nowhere near the truth. If either movie came close to the truth, I think I would like the movie even more. John Goodman did a better job at portraying Babe Ruth then William Bendix did."
4,Well done,"John Goodman's role is so realistic that I thought I was seeing the Babe many times! He is outstanding in his role as Babe Ruth. Hollywoood liberties, sure ...... but an excellent story and a look at an Baseball hero ........... A must for baseball fans."
1,Over Eager,"In my excitement to see another Batman - Hush encounter I never bothered reading the comments in here. If I had done so before then I would never had bought this title.The story was....there was no story it's just a mish-mash of what have you. Nothing really ties up to anything. The joker became a mob lord, Prometheus became lame, Hush is no longer calculating but was able to best Talia...WTF.And Batman...well batman was more like uhm...forgot he was even in the story.I just wish I never bought the damn thing, then I could have had only good memories of the Hush franchise."
5,Turbo Jam RULES,Absolutely love Chalene and her DVDs... having so much fun and recently discovered that I have ABS! Looking forward to seeing a SIX PACK... on MY body! Unbelievable... Never ENJOYED a workout till now! Never saw such results until now!
3,Disappointing Jam,"I LOVE Charlene Johnson and the Turbo Jam series, but I have to say I was sadly disappointed in this DVD program. I felt it was really slow moving and not terribly challenging or effective. I had a sore tush after doing the exercises but the program is not even close to as enjoyable as most of the others. The Cardio Party DVDs are phenomenal and fun and I was expecting the same from this workout. Sad to say...it will be shelved."
1,Turbo Jam Live! Booty Sculpt and Abs,I have still not received this DVD. Can you just refund my money Bad Business. XOXOXOXO!!!!!!!!!!! need to cantactAmazon for a full refund terrible.
5,Video was just what was advertised,The DVD came quicker than promised and was very good quality. I would order from this vendor anytime.
3,"Nice watch, small band","This is a nice watch, cool design, but for a size medium the band is very small! Most of the Nike watches of this design were labelled small or short so I purchased a medium thinking it would work on my 7 inch wrist. It fits ok but feels a little tight. I purchased it to use while I'm swimming, so I am going to keep it but if I had to wear it all day I think it would annoy me. Unless this watch was meant for teenagers and not adults, (in which case they should label it as such!), they should make larger sizes as a lot of women don't have tiny wrists, especially athletes!"
4,Hard to get use to!!!!,"I heard an import copy in a Japanese CD Shop. I must admit I expected more. I am more of a fan of their style when they made the first two albums. There is considerable growth displayed by the band members in this cd. But if you are an old school GC Fan then you mostly will have issues adapting to their new sound. I give them credit for being brave enough to venture from their successful formula on the first 3 albums that brought them into the light. Now we shall see if they lead the groups like them (Sum 41, Simple Plan, etc.) into a new age of punk/pop or if artists like fall out boy have taken the lead and GC heads down a road on its own."
2,Over produced,wow. i've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.He's done alot of great work... but damn this cd ain't even catchy one bit.you can hear the pitch fixer on benji's voice throughout the entire cd... it's bad. like realllllly bad. and it's way over produced...
1,Good Charlotte fan...save your money,"I bought Morning Revival when it was first released, I was really exited to listen to it, I had waited a long time for them to release this CD. When I first put it into my cd player, I listened to the first few songs and was mortified. I remember that I turned it off after a few songs and put the CD away and didn't bring it back out until today when I was going through my CD collection to update my iTunes. I thought maybe I made a mistake so I just listened to the whole thing again. I still stand by my original judgment that the cd is horrible. I understand them may be trying to take thier music in a new direction, but this was the wrong direction to go. The songs had no rythm and I think Joel was out of tune throughout much of it. The only song that was bearable was Jealousy. If you are a fan of thier other music, I would not recommend to buy Morning Revival. Save your money, buy some Panic! At the Disco or some Fall Out Boy, much better than this."
4,Preeeetty Darn Good,"When I heard the demos on iTunes the songs sounded pretty bad, but then I decided to buy it and I have been pretty happy with it. I especially like the song All Black and Keep Your Hands Off My Girl. If you wan't more than a 30 sec demo then go to Good Charlotte's myspace, they have some songs their. Overall it's a bit different than The Chronicles Of Life And Death, but still a must have for GC fans."
5,Excellent Soothing Music,"I really enjoy listening to this music. It is good background music, yet not boring to listen to. Mr.Gibson uses truly masterful musical techniques to bring back old southern songs. This is one of my favorite CDs!"
3,Sister Act I Sound Track,"Wonderful mix of music from the movie. Its great to hear some of the instrumental pieces such as ""Nuns to the Rescue"". My only gripe with it really is Whoopi Goldberg's rather flat rendition of ""I will Follow Him"".All in all, a great CD to listen to, but if you are really into Gospel, try Sister Act 2's sound track."
5,"Not Prog, but great.","Their first. This Criminally underated album was how they started off, as an almost Cat Stevens like band. Don't dudge this album by what Genesis became but dudge for what it is-a gentle little album. The music here is so cool, mellow and relaxing. Beautiful-not Genesis, but great..."
3,Great shape/bad finish,"I love the shape/size/weight of these bowls, but they stain so easily. I had a very little bit of red wine in one bowl and put a smaller one in it. When I did the dishes after dinner, the outside of the smaller bowl was badly stained. The larger bowl wasn't - the inside of the bowls have a shiny, more protected finish. Sorry, but I just can't be bothered to rinse as I go and I don't like kitchen tools that I have to baby. If you want these, buy a dark color."
1,This man is not a good writer,"I wanted a more clever and biting title for this review but not sure I would get away with it. This ""writer"" has written books by three of my favorite musicians-Townshend, Rod Stewart and Paul McCartney. Unfortuntely, I have read all three. His prose is nothing to get excited about, his books contains errors that any casual fan could point out, and he is just rather slimy in his selection on what to cover. If he ever get to Springsteen, I will know not to bother. You would be wise to avoid anything with this man's name on the cover."
2,Wait for the real deal...,"Since this is a review about the book, I normally do not wish to mention anything about the author. But it is truly hard to do so: apart from the several pages devoted to his interaction with Pete, the style of writing betrays a strange disconnection of the author from his subject: while his life did cross paths with Pete's more often than most of us readers, the author doesn't seem to have ""gotten"" his subject. He quotes George Harrison at the back while seemingly being unable to see what George, the master of thoughtful sarcasm, meant.Pete's writing his own book and that will be worth the wait. Get another book in the meantime, unless you can pick this up at your local used books place."
2,However Much I Booze,"This third rate account of the life of Pete Townshend focuses mainly on his drinking, drug use and search for spirituality. The ideas behind the lyrics and the actual making of the music are glossed over. Seems like the author simply read a bunch of interviews and album reviews and cobbled this book together haphazardly. What few pictures it has aren't even in color.[DW]"
2,Try something else,The book is well organized but diagrams/figures are incorrect and misleading in relation to the task for which it was designed. It does not seem to be a botanist's work.
5,A spurt of energy,"Nesting is fun to do, fun to read, and fun to look at. Reading this gem will give any reluctant decorator or entertainer a spurt of energy to go for it. Whether you're throwing a girly party for a dozen or curling up with a cup of tea , this is an inspirational guide to refer to. A reference book for making one's house a home."
5,Great Housewarming or Wedding Gift,"When we moved last year, my new neighbor gave me this book as a housewarming gift. It was such a treat! It would make a great wedding gift too. I loved all the quick and easy recipes. I also loved all the ideas about how to make our new house a home. Great book!"
5,Cute and useful book!,My hubby gave me this book for our first Christmas as a married couple. I love it! Cute ideas and lighthearted writing style. Great present for a new bride.
1,Disapppinting,I purchased because friends had told me that I would love it. I did not. There were rude comments throughout the book. Not what I expected.
4,Great read!,"I read this book on 1 day, I couldn't put my kindle down, so I turned on the text to speech so I could listen to it. I going to read it again."
1,not good,"the problem is for that product is sweeting inside , i changed two times and the same probems both of them."
5,Great puncher!,Great product. It's easy to use and is durable. I've had it for over 3 months and still no issues.
5,Tales from the road,Lamb of God is the best newer metal band out there! I've been to four of their shows in KC and they never disappoint. Wathcing this you get to know the band and realize they are real dudes who love to play and drink and they are a fans band. Check out the Congregation on their site.
1,The Iron Bridge Fails,"Having forced myself to complete this pitiful example of a pseudo-historical fiction, I can only determine that it was chosen for publication for the lesbian sex scene. It is completely without merit, having a pitiful ending and leaving me with a complete lack of any feeling other than 'Why was this published?' In my fifty-seven years I have run across only one other book that I would rate worse, that being MOONSPIN.Do not waste your money, time or effort reading this. His Heroine arrives naked with a single goal, she fails pitifully after becoming mired in the Quaker religion (which this books spends much too much time explaining and pushing upon the reader.) Yet somehow the writer ends his work with the assumption that 'she does a good thing.'If I could, I would get my money and time back."
5,a great gift,I bought the Snowbaby Bedtime Buddies for a gift. The person who I bought it for collects them. She liked it very much. I received the item quickly and on time. Plus with free shipping. I got the figurine in perfect condition. No signs of damage any where on it. The size of this item would normally cost you any where from $25 to $30 dollars in a specialty store. I got it $5 - $10 dollars cheap and got free shipping when I placed my final order. Can't beat that.
2,Very Disappointing,"This Live DVD serves as a prime example of the difference between studio work and a live concert situation. In contrast to their studio stuff, the horns are off rhythmically and in intonation most of the times, and the rhythm section is not grooving at all.Since I really liked their studio CDs I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, and let me tell you, I was never so disappointed in a music DVD as I was in this one.I am a musician myself, I play ska/reaggae and know what it's supposed to sound like. And that's why I will in the future stick to artists like The Skatalites and the The Slackers for the real thing!!"
5,Music Appreciation 101,"The debut release from this extraordinary trio is a virtual music appreciation course presented on one disc. This album is capable of giving the listener a respect not only for classical music, but also for the jazz and rock influences contained within. The music was recorded nearly 30 years ago, yet shows no sign of age, standing up incredibly well in this new millenium. Each member of the trio gets ample opportunity to show off his talents. Keith Emerson's keyboard playing is simply breathtaking on ""Take A Pebble"" and ""The Three Fates."" Carl Palmer's percussion solo on ""Tank"" is simply amazing. And Greg Lake's haunting ballad ""Lucky Man"" showcases his angelic tenor at its best. ELP's debut album pushed the boundaries of popular music upon its release in 1970. It continues to stand as a monumental musical achievement in the history of rock music."
1,Bad remastering,"Warning! If you have the old Victory remastering--keep it, and do not buy this new ""remastering""...! They've botched the job and it sounds worse than any of the previous releases. I'm seriously disappointed in Shout.I have been an audiophile for 30 years and my current system is Krell Evolution electronics and B&W; 802D speakers."
4,Emerson Lake&Palmer (Rhino),"Their classic first lp reissued on CD,originally released in 1970.Some refer to this as their 'Dove Album' because it's cover is graced with an image of a dove.Most often played tunes here are ""Knife Edge"" and their signature tune ""Lucky Man"".I also enjoyed the three-part composition of the classically-arranged ""The Three Fates"".Also good to hear is ""Tank"" which I believe they still perform on tour,when they headline.Any true fan of the progressive genre should have a copy of this disc."
5,A meaningful musical dialog,"ELP broke onto the scene with this one... ""Lucky Man"" switched ears to the `on' position, essentially ushering in a new sub-genre. The Moog synthesizer was a new technological innovation, a power trio who spoke the rich language of learned musicians... they really were groundbreakers who eventually left the scene completely changed by adding so dynamically to the aural landscape."
4,Very good,An excellent work. Well-written and well-researched. I'm impressed that UP allowed Klein unlimited access to their records and did not ask to censor anything.
1,Stay away from this one!,"Get this album if: 1) you like techno 2) you don't like Metallica in the first place 3) you've never heard any of Die Krupps' albumsI love Metallica and I love Die Krupps, but for some reason combining them was a BAD idea. Picture springy, robotic versions of 'tallica's songs barely recognizable from the originals, and Die Krupps totally selling out in some wierd way, and you get the idea. No matter how much you like Metallica, there's nothing much here worth saving."
1,poor quality,The cd's do not work! I want to return them. Delivery time was lengthy.Instant Immersion Italian
1,Don't let even a drop get in your eyes,"This may help with dandruff if you use it a number of times. I have used it the last four or five shampoos and the dandruff is only slightly less.But I am not going to use it again. The first time some got in my eyes. They burned, they stung. I washed it out in the shower, repeatedly flushing my eyes. The burning continued for a number of hours. Then I was extremely careful in subsequent uses but today even though I was careful I got a drop in the eye. I flushed and flushed. It is not burning but to heck with this.I called the optometrist's office after the burning. Received a call back from the office in which I was told that is was possibly the menthol or the amount of menthol in the product. I'd like confirmation of what causes such extreme irritation so I can buy another brand without the offending ingredient."
5,It really works!,"I like to call this product my ""little insurance policy"". When interacting closely with people it is nice to know I have something that helps me feel comfortable insuring I won't share my last meal with unsupecting people."
4,Faux rock,"I received the item on time but unfortunately the usable size was not specified correctly. I was disappointed that it wouldn't fit what I bought it to cover [septic equipment], I thought it looked nice. Brookstone kindly sent UPS to pick up and I received a full credit in a short amount of time. Would happily order from vendor again."
2,"Horrible,Horrible,Horrible!","I have read many books that are intended to shock and disgust it's readers, but this book was a down right mission to read! I have read from Chuck Palnichuk to Kurt Vonegut so I am not easily surprised or turned off by racey content. This has to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It is very difficult to follow who is talking and what they are actually talking about! I give it a big thumbs down!!!"
5,Up with the best.,"Perhaps the title should say just ""The Best"". First the sonics are absolutely fine. It's 20 years old and sounds like it was recorded yesterday.The first CD is the Prologue and Act one. CD 2 is Act two, and CD 3 is the third act.Unlike others, Mongrelia does NOT race through numbers just to get it onto 2 CDs. This is not to say that some tempi aren't fast, but they are all balanced. When he should linger - Good Fairy's theme - he does, to stunning effect. The muscular moment are strong and have a resonant bass drum that is very present without obliterating the music.Most of all the piece is complete. Yes, it runs longer than Dorati, but Dorati takes some very ""symphonic"" tempi, which means he's dramatic but you couldn't dance to it. Mongrelia is actually better.Enjoy the Naxos price, too. Now if only Naxos would reissue the Lenard Swan Lake. It is uncut and fabulous, too."
1,Very strange fit!,"The last time I was at my mom's she had just bought one of these. It looked very comfortable and pretty so I ordered one in my size. I wear a 34D in other brands, but Playtex doesn't carry that size, so I buy a 36D and wear it on the tightest hooks. This band seems to run small, the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands, I could wear it on the last hooks. The cups, on the other hand, run big. The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy, so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side, really not flattering! A very odd fit, which is too bad because it seems like a comfortable bra."
2,"Uh... This Is Way To Big To REALLY Be A ""C"" Cup...","My bra is a C cup, I am a D cup (I buy smaller to hold em in better), and the cup of this bra is too big for some reason."
3,Playtex Women's Comfort Lace Wirefree Bra,"Runs quite large, both in cup size and around the chest. However it is comfortable. Recommend going down a size for perfect fit."
3,Pretty bra,Unfortunately it ends there as for me the support in keeping the girls up just doesn't cut it as the front closure bra does.
2,Healthy but not delicious.,"I tried to have an open mind with this bar because of how healthy and natural it is, but it's just not for me. The taste, smell and after taste remind me of stale beer. I could eat this if needed but it's really unpleasant. Two of my coworkers who eat really healthy tried this but couldn't get beyond 1-2 bites. I highly suggest you try a single bar before buying a 12-pack. Good luck!Coworker comments:""Tastes like bitter metal.""""Should never be ingested.""""Not to be taken orally."""
5,I keep going back to this gem,"The Pawnshop Chronicles offers a perfect blend of heartwarming humor and common sense business insight. It's both joyous and educational (if that's possible), with just the right amount of nostalgia thrown in. The stories Rossin relates are so real that I can almost hear him telling them to me. I only wish all business books were this entertaining."
3,Good For Light Use,"This item is easy to assemble, but if it is overloaded, you may run into a little trouble with it bending to the side. Overall, for light use, it works. Get the bigger one if you plan to fill it up."
3,Flimsy,"We assembled these as the instructions indicated, but the product was still very flimsy. You can't argue the price, but the quality is questionable. If I was to purchase another, I would look for another brand."
5,These are great,"I got a couple of these for my home networking rewiring project. They are great to manage a bunch of bulky power supplies with plugs built-in.Not much to say really, except that the splitter seems to be of high quality. Exactly what I expected, and exactly what I needed at a good price."
5,The Visit,"This story of little Abigail's visit with her great-aunt and -uncle was probably the favorite of all my daughters' many books. It reminded me of visits to my grandparent's homes and the treasures found inside them, verbal and otherwise. By the time she was three, my elder daughter had heard it read so much that she was able to recite much of it.A great deal of the book's charm comes from Eloise Wilkins' illustrations. The details shown fostered many a discussion and reminisces with my girls. Each picture brings the words to life and takes the reader into the very places Abigail inhabits. Her indecision about sleeping away from Mother in a strange place is reflected in her eyes at first, but the wonders of the place soon have her opinion firmly set. Who wouldn't enjoy this trip into a child's first vacation?"
1,Dangerous for children!,"My nieces grandmother bought this waterslide for their birthdays. The set up is quite easy and the kids do have fun however, mixing an inflatable and water is not a good idea. We had some neighbor girls over to play with my nieces and one of the girls flew down the slide so quickly she landed on the grass onto her back and knocked the wind out of herself! She was okay to breathe after a few minutes but also has a large bruise on her back. If this is happening to kids while being supervised, I can only imagine what is happening to kids who are not being watched! I expect this item will be recalled in a few weeks!"
5,Classic Warner Romace,A notch above many of the teen movies of the early 1960's. Suzanne Pleshette and Troy Donohue are the love interests. Beautifully filmed in Italy with a great Max Steiner score. The hit song AL-Di-La became a world famous song due to this 1962 film.
4,Troy's sensitivity for all to see.,"I feel Troy Donahue was one of the tradgedies of Holloywood.He burst on the secene in the late 50's when love/rommance motion pictures were rapidly giving way to action,adventure,obscentiy,nudity,violence and all the other vulgarities we see today.He displayed Charisma,warmth,and a real screen presense in the films he made.Rome adventure was the film in which His latent talent started to bloom.It was truly tragic He was never given more adult roles with greater physcological depth but was all too often cast as the teenage heart throb.By the mid 60's the type of films in which he was at his best were no longer in vouge and he was discarded.But for a brief period of 5 or 6 years he brought a sensitivity to romance that has not been seen since and rarely before.I look back nostalgically on those years when he was truly the prince of Hollywood."
3,Corny but that is the way love stories sometimes are.,I saw this movie when it first came out and love the theme and the story line. It was mushy with a touch of conflict between the Troy Donnahue and Angie Dickenson. But love triumphs in the end. Look for the candleabra that is the start.
2,Could have bought a new printer for the price of a set of toner cartridges,"I purchased a complete set of 4 toner cartridges for my HP 2600N Color Laser Printer. Looking around at several stores, the Laserjet 1600 was available for less than the cost of a set of catriges. The 2600N Could be purchased for about the same price. I checked with the vendors and both printers ship with FULL CAPACITY toner cartridges, not starter cartridges.I realize this is how HP makes a ton of profits, but it's time to reprice the toner cartriges to a realistic level. Are these HP printer becoming disposable items....Enough said!"
4,"Good value, good quality, completely satisfied","I have had the printer for nearly a year and use it for personal use. I have been impressed with it overall from a reliability, maintainability, quality, and speed perspective. It meets all my needs and I have not had a single issue with it. I plan to buy another one from Costco for $189 since it costs that much for the toner cartridges themselves...then I have a spare printer as well."
5,"Very moving, complex movie","This is a story about mourning, break up, rekindled love, best friends and so much more. This movie shows the complexities of relationships, guilt and desire. The acting is terrific, with Cheryl Ladd as a powerful lead. Bess Armstrong and William R. Moses also carry their weight. This is a movie that demands to be watched more than once. It's also verrrrrry affordable at $5.99."
3,my radio sure sounds good to me,"larry graham and co. bring the music home with this classic, it is definitely a must have for all music lovers of r&b, check it out, you won't be disappointed.peace!"
4,Doesn't shrink!,"I've been looking for a true undershirt that will stay tucked in for a while. This T shrank about 1/2 inch, still leaving it over 29"": from shoulder to waist. Too early to say how it will wear, but great start!"
4,Excellent material on the nuances of Quranic translation,"The material in the beginning of this book is excellent commentary by the author on the nuances of Quranic Arabic translation. The qirat (vocal recitation) in the accompanying CD is also quite good. I gave this book 4 stars because it does not contain actual quranic arabic text (either roman transliteration or Arabic text), making it difficult for most Muslims to recognize the excerpts of the Quran from their English translation alone."
2,Not a religious Book,"I consider to read this book as a waste of time for religious study. Quran is viewed as a piece of poetry. Author in many occasions tries to tie the Qur'an with ancient Arabic poetry and tries to find paralells. I could not find any phrase that tells to the reader that this book is send down to humanity by God through Prophet Mohammed. I did not expect him to believe that but the whole approach is from a literary point of view. The minimal amount of commentaries are mostly his own as a pure interpreatation as a literary text. Poetic nature is emphasised and paralells are drawn between ancient Arabic themas and the Quranic subjects. There is nothing to learn from this book. If you want to read better things against Qur'an or Islam read Ibn Warraq, if you want to read real interpretation there are much much better books, read Gatje, Peters. This book introduces the Holy Qur'an as a piece of literature and poetry not as a divine book."
2,Er.....what's that....?,"Coming right off of finishing Laughing in the Wind and into this series was probably not a good thing....I'm half-way through and debating if I should wrap this as a Christmas gift for some of my unsuspecting ""TV serial newbie friends"". Not really anything to brag about - the plot seems very simplistic, but tries too hard to be deep and significant. TOO MANY slow-motion ""glamour shots"" and ""sticatto"" action scenes.I wouldn't recommend spending so much money on something like this...."
2,Just didn't do it for me.....,"This one never did sit well with me. In fact, I got a real bad attitude towards the lead male character, Eben, concerning his tendency to tell the kids he didn't want them.... and I never got over it! lol Eben was a little bit over the edge in his bitterness. I think if it hadn't been for that, if Eben could have just attempted to not let those kids see his bitterness, I could have enjoyed the other characters in the story. Anyway, the whole story was about Eben becoming human again, which he did eventually but not before he really tore up that little boy. It just broke my heart... I guess I'm too much of a mom to put up with someone like him; in my book, it's never the kids fault... they shouldn't have to pay for adults mistakes & they should be loved & protected regardless of the circumstances. I had a really bad attitude through out most of the book! lol"
1,Not Happy!,I ordered the box set and only received 1 of the books out of the set. It was for a birthday present and I couldn't replace it or find it elsewhere in time. Not happy!
1,Jerry Lee Lewis,"I received this item and it was in great condition, Then when I went to view it I received this message:Region Error-Please eject the disc.-Playaback is not authorized in your region.I have no idea what that means. To me it means I cannot view the item I paid for. I don't think this is a normal DVD.Is there something we can do about this? I have never had that problem before.grace2u"
3,i don't mean this item,"As a mastter of facxt i did'nt mean this item.it's a moovie and not a show,so i returned it back as a return item.Buy the way would you please tell me if you got it and when i suppose to reciev my refund.Tank's a lotgideon arbel"
5,The Killer personified!,"As far as recreating the rock and roll related events of Jerry Lee's life, this movie is tops. Dennis Quade gives 110% as the hard rocking musician. Under the instruction of the man himself, Dennis quade learns how to play all the great songs on the piano. As your watching the movie...you are actually watching Dennis play that piano. Jerry Lee was a fireball in his early days and this movie shows how crazy he really got to be. Entertaining, insightful and as rocking as you could ask for; this movie shows there IS a whole lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than Great Balls of Fire. Seeing him rock out with Dennis Quade at the end of the movie was an added bonus...the Killer still has it!"
4,this helpe people,"The title of this book is good and the book is good to she is good and she GOD child in LIFE to help in this WOLD,"
4,She has fath in her,"Hi,pet , I like the firest book it is good Iwell by the next one , think you ,ps, Iwill like to meet this person one day ,"
3,Average recording,"When listening to this recording, I felt that many of the pieces played were too rushed. The Nutcracker is a ballet and most of the dances are traditionally danced a little slower than they are played on this recording. Also, I feel that if you really want a feel for this ballet and its music, it is much wiser to purchase the full length Nutcracker recording"
1,NO CORE SUPPORT,Pillow was not what I expected. Previous cervical pillows I have owned had a core of hard foam under each lobe and soft foam around the cores. I returned this pillow without even taking out of the bag - seller ripped me off by charging a ridiculous restocking fee. I cannot recommend this pillow or this seller.
4,tight beats on the remix album,im feelin most of the beats on this album. I was just expecting some new material. still though if u a fan youll feel this shi$ right here. cats need to come out and support that yay area u feel? RWC right here 2ndave 600's
1,Language?,"I had to enter a rating to post this question, but I haven't seen the movie.I'm interested in getting this but am wondering about the language. I'm assuming this would be a ""G"" movie to today's audience if they use Shakespeare's words. If it has been ""modernized"", is there swearing? Specifically, is the Lord's name taken in vain? Any ""F"" words?"
1,Gratuitous Nudity,I was assigned to watch this for a class. The nudity was not essential to the plot. I read the play and it does not call for nudity.
5,Pacino's Best Ever!,"Who would have thought tough guy Al Pacino would provide the the most sensitive, believable and meaningful portrayal of Shylock ever to hit the stage or screen? This DVD is an essential for both Pacino AND Shakespeare fans, two groups I would never have associated together before. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting is flawless, and don't miss the notes and interviews. In fact, watch them first, to enjoy the film even more the first time. An all time favorite."
3,"Well done, but...","I ordered this video to use in my classroom after we read The Merchant of Venice. I would love to use it, as it is well done, unfortunately, though, there is so much nudity in the video that I don't think I can. If you are looking for a ""clean"" version of this play to use in a classroom, this isn't it!"
4,Happy with the purchase.,Received the movie in a timely matter. Would order again from the same source.
1,The Complete Book Of Finches And Softbills,"This book does not cover the different types of finches & softbills. It is very general information only, on breeding and care of finches & softbills, no help to the person wanting more specific info. on the different types of finches and their care."
4,Great for breeding info but not for finch ID,Excellent book for breeding info but was hoping that the book supplied an identification guide for finches as well which was not the case.
5,Dang Awesome Story!!!,"I first read Cyrano de Bergerac when I was in sixth grade and I loved it. When I was in my freshman year at high school, I read in the newspaper that the Utah State Theatre Department at USU would be doing a production of Cyrano. I called as soon as I could to audition. We used this exact book as the script for the play, and it was a smashing success.This really is a fine version of the original, and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,BEST!,"Best English translation around. The original (French) is in verse. Unfortunately, French verse dose not translate well into English. The best ""verse"" translation into English is by Anthony Burgess (Mostly known for his novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" -Anthony Burgess also did the English subtitles to Gerard Depardieu's French language Cyrano.) However, if you want to get the best ""feel"" for the original, in my opinion, the Brian Hooker translation is the only way to go. (The Jose Ferrer movie used the Hooker translation)I would welcome any opinions. William"
3,The movies are better,"This is a rare example of the movie(s) being better than the book. It's a great story, but I find plays difficult to read. Its true beauty is displayed in two ""five-star"" films, one with José Ferrer, and the other with naturally big-nosed Depardieu."
2,Ronnie's the best? YEAH BUDDY - but this dvd isnt!,"If you wanna see Mr. O having great amazing workouts, buy this, if you want to learn how you can improve, maybe better off saving your money. While the DVD is no doubt showing one of the best ever, Ronnie doesn't explain anything, there's no info on strategies, diet, pre-contest diet, bukling phases, etc. It's just Ronnie lifting ""light weight!""."
2,not an intense video,"This video is boring as hell. If you want an intense video by Ronnie's Cost of Redemption, or any of Jay Cutler's videos (preferably One Step Closer) do NOT buy this one. it's boring"
5,Pure comedy,"The funniest thing I have ever seen in my life! I have a six pack as a result of watching this,it was THAT funny. The part with the tablets was quality. The training was ok too.Before I saw this I wasnt a big fan of his but now, well, may he reign for ever! YEAH BUDDY!"
3,Not accurately presented,"The gum itself is pretty good for non-sorbitol gum. I chew it every day and it is good for keeping breath fresh. Unfortunately, the amount of gum is not accurately portrayed in this product listing. When I received 12 eight-packs of gum instead of 24 twelve-packs. I contacted the seller right away and was refunded the appropriate amount. So, I commend the seller on great customer service."
3,Good series...,This is a good series. I like the details about life in that time peroid. I also love that God was moving through their lives. I do wish that the stories were longer but I always do!
4,Another Great Book from Lauraine Snelling!,The Dakotah Treasures is another great series from Lauraine Snelling. The characters in this book are so incredible. Having Medora ND as the setting is so intriguing. She depicts the scenery of the Badlands just as they are-Beautiful. This series is a must for anyone who likes historical/christian fiction. Can't wait for the next book!
3,Good attempt.,"This book has a lot of ramen recipes. Some are exotic and interesting, but there are a few problems. There are foods that college students wouldnt touch, like goat cheese. The foods are not priced properly. Avacados for 50 cents? I live in california and they're not even that cheap. Also the recipes calls for a few ingredients that are not really used often like oyster sauce and curry."
2,Mildly Amusing,I expected more from the Mastermixers...what did they mix here?just straight music...nothing new...nothing fun...just average vocals with average music. I have heard other Beatle impersonators do mixes and I DO love the Beatles but...I will be selling my copy soon.
1,Shreds apart,"These were bought for slippers. What a mistake! Every time I took them off, my feet would leave tuffs of lambswool everywhere. Within a month there was not any lambswool left on the insole."
1,None of these titles are John Wayne Films,"You're being conned. Do the research. Not one of these titles is a John Wayne film. Nuff said.Please note that somehow this review is attaching itself to other titles!!!This review is for those John Wayne Collections that have the titles Cold Vengeance, Guns Along the Trail, Stagecoach Run, Gold Strike River, Stolen Goods, and Innocent Man. These titles ARE NOT JOHN WAYNE MOVIE TITLES. Some people have noted that they are new titles for colorized versions of other films, but I can't confirm that. When in doubt, check the IMDB for John Wayne's filmography."
1,NO VALE NI UN CENTAVO!!!,EVITEN COMPRAR ESTE CD YO SOY FAN DE ANICETO PERO ESTE CD ES UN ROBO SOLO CONTIENE PEDAZOS DE CANCIONES CON LA VOZ DE ANICETO EXPLICANDO LA CANCION LO MALO QUE NO EXPLICAN ESTO ANTES DE COMPRAR EL CD.
3,tough trip through paradise,"I'm a former U.S. History teacher who has recently visited Yellowstone area and read a number of books about this area and the mid-19th century west. This was not one of my favorites. Keep in mind that it's written from another person's journal, and the original journalist admits to his lack of writing skill. Mike"
3,Very generic techno mixes...,"So, another of those Erasure maxi-CDs. The version I'm reviewing is the US version, which might have different tracks. The first four tracks are techno mixes by JX & the beatmasters. It's all rather filler-sounding, the first track (JX mix) is the most promising but it sounds a bit too mindlessly ATB-ish for its own good.Then you have the b-side ""Dodo"" which is just plain weird (not in a good way).Finally you have an alternative version of ""Because You're so sweet"" from the ""I Say^3"" album, which is the only decent song here. This version is more acoustic sounding than the album version. (But, this song might not even be on the import single, so there you have it...)All in all, only for the Erasure collector."
3,Pixar serves up a dose of white bread with water,"I don't know if its the fault of the writer or the director, but it all just felt so mundanely mechanical, so by the numbers, and honestly after seeing a film like Mary & Max, which I know isn't the same type of animation, I can't take Pixar too seriously anymore, even Dreamworks outdid them this year with How to Train Your Dragon."
2,3D version not worth looking at for me.,"the 2D version picture is outstanding and this is a really great movie.too bad the 3D version don't look anywhere near as good as the 2D version on blu-ray.in 3D the colors look kind of washed out and it doesn't have as much details in the picture.one more problem i have with the 3D version is that it skips a lot and repeats the same part over and over,i have to fastfoward just to keep it from skipping."
2,NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE,"I LOVE this movie. LOVE.That said-- I was pretty excited to get a digital copy of this so I could watch it wherever, but it won't load.Is it expired? Already used? Don't know as the screen where the activation code goes is blank.Sigh."
5,Great Movie,Pixar has done it again. The new movie is as good as the first and entertains our grandchildren for hours. I especially liked the digital version included with the set so I can play the movie on my Ipad for the kids.
3,Disappointed in the language used,"I thought this movie was great from the beginning to the end, except one thing the creators just _had_ to slip in. When Barbie and Ken meet, they're checking each other out and barbie slips out ""Nice As---cot"", which is reference to the tie Ken had on, but obviously adults and filthy minded kids would get the underlying meaning. Just a fyi, an ascot is a 19th century short tie. I can understand this stuff in Shrek, but this is supposed to be Disney! I just don't see what the point of slipping in this kind of language in a kids movie serves.Other than this, it's a good movie, had a bit more darker tones, with the toys feeling abandoned, facing death at one point, and ultimately having to say goodbye to Andy. I don't think I'd recommend it for the youngest ones."
5,TOY STORY 3,"I LOVED this movie. I bought it to complete the set, couldn't wait to watch it and was not disappointed. It's a happy/sad/feel good movie for anyone to enjoy."
4,"Great Movie, Good Quality","Kids loved this movie. 3 year old and 7 year old, kept them captivated most of the time.Streaming worked well to Roku player, no issues. Quality was nice."
1,HORRIBLEY CREEPY!,This movie is so creepy! Don't get it! Or even watch it! STAY AWAY FROM TOY STORY 3! I had nightmares all night1
1,What the....?,"THANKS Pixar!My 6-year old now has recurring nightmares after watching this. Totally unsuitable for kids age 6 or less. Too brutal, too scary. She cried for 10 minutes during the scene where Woody and his party were supposed to go up in flames. Not to mention the creepy monkey in the monitoring room and the spooky baby doll on the swing during the late escape.Part 1 and 2 used to be kind of nice. But this one is totally off the chart. NOT recommendable."
4,Toy Story 3,"I really enjoyed the third part to this trilogy. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I is worth going and seeing in the theaters but you should really enjoy before you should buy it. The story carries really well. There is some pretty good action when the toys try to escape from a day care. The movie shows a lot of character depth. Woody shows character throughout the movie. I like some of the new toys in the movie like Barbie and Ken. They bring a little extra comedy to the film. I saw the movie in 3D at the theaters but I didn't really see that much of a difference. I think I would've been fine and still thought the movie was really good without 3D. It did add some depth to different scenery but besides that I really didn't notice the 3D. Overall, I would recommend it for any family. I'd say save your money and just watch the 2D because there isn't too much of a difference."
5,Unbelievable,"Just when you thought Pixar couldn't deliver again, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece. It's even better than the first two Toy Story films. Do not listen to the few reviews that put the movie down. Not sure how anyone could possibly not like this movie. It's really that good."
4,Good but not great for the real youngsters,"This movie was very well animated as usual and it had many great moments. Our problem was that we watched it with our 2 and 5 year old kids and there a few different scenes that were just too intense for them. My 5 year old daughter, who is admittedly pretty emotional, ran from the room in tears at least once. She came back and we finished the movie, so I thought it was a temporary thing. But a couple weeks later I suggested we watch it again when some cousins were over and she yelled out, ""Mom said I never had to watch that show again!"" and was upset. Anyway, YMMV but just be warned that this movie might be too intense for young kids, which I assumed was the target market. By the way, they both loved both of the other Toy Story movies."
5,Haven't seen 1 or 2 but we love 3!!!,This is a terrific movie for the whole family all ages! Glad I decided to buy it. My son was still two when the film was at the theaters. He's three now and can enjoy bites and pieces of a movie. This is one that I can see and hear over and over again (which I will) and not grow too tire of it too soon. He loves the dinosaur and the action scenes. What a classic!
4,Great family movie,"We all love the Toy Story movies and the third one is just as entertaining. I like the first one the best but my pre teen kids love them all. Gotta see the special features and the ""shorts"" lol......"
5,Amazing Trilogy,Not much can be said. I grew up with Toy Story. The 3rd movie blew me away. Amazing and perfect. I was lucky enough to get the Blu Ray trilogy brand new at a pawn shop for $24. Let's just say it was the best deal of all time. I love these movies. They define my childhood. Classics for all time.
3,just ok,The plot for this movie was weak when compared to ts 1 and ts 3. But the kids enjoyed it and it sets the stage for introducing Jesse's character. The first and the third movies were outstanding.
5,an old time favorite,"i remember toy story 1 when i was younger, now im sharing it with my son who fell in love with these toys very quickly. great family classics"
4,Scary scenes but no different than other classic famiy movies.,"There are a curious amount of negative reviews of Toy Story 3, mainly due to some of its scarier scenes. Many comment on how it made their children cry or gave them nightmares. That is unfortunate and I feel for those parents, as I have also shown ""family"" movies to my kids and was surprised when scary scenes made them cry. But sad and/or scary scenes are not new to Disney movies or any other family movies. Remember the death of Bambi's Mom or the end of Old Yeller. Wizard of Oz is a classic family film but is filled with dark scary scenes.TS3 has some intense scenes that obviously have effected younger viewers. Some family movies are like that and always have been. Be thankful you have sensitive caring children and enjoy this movie."
4,Love the Movie,The movie was very entertaining as a grown-up and as a child (all four grandchildren ages 3 to 6 enjoyed it.
3,Needs editing!,"I've never posted an Amazon review before, but I've got to share the irony that this book is the worst-edited book I've ever read. The material is good and I'm learning a lot, but there is an enormous amount of redundancy. Beyond that, there are more than a few grammatical errors, accidentally-inserted words or characters, and odd and oddly-used metaphors. I realized when I started to laugh out loud at the text that I needed to share this. Someone EDIT this please!"
2,Mostly junk,"This book is 1/3 listings of movies and other such irrelevant nonsense.The editing information may have been relevant several years ago, but is now completely and totally dated.Certainly readable, but completely vapid."
3,A Good Start to Editing,"""Editing Digital Video"" is a good overall review of editing. The book tries to touch on both the creative and the technical. It may be hard to teach the creative in these short pages, but it at least points you in the direction. Although it was in depth in teaching the basic of the basics of editing, such as ""What is a shot?"" it lacked when it came to describing more technical terms such as ""What is 16:9?"" It also gives an overview of all editing systems, nothing in depth on specific ones, such as Avid or Final Cut Pro, granted many have conformed to the same operations, it would have been nice to have subtle differences pointed out.Overall, I think this book is a good book for beginner's and for advanced editor's that occasionally have brain freezes when working."
4,One of Jennifer Blake's historical love stories,"Not a big fan of her contemporaries, I was thrilled to see another historical novel. Not quite as great as some of her earlier novels, but still enjoyable."
1,NOISY KITCHENAID.,A VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. AND I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER. THE MIXER IS INCREDIBLY LOUD --- NOT AT ALL THE QUALITY OF MY 25-YEAR-OLD KITCHENAID.
4,Ruff Ryders Got The Compilations Down Pact,Sweet album not great especially LT's song its a nice song but it totally throws off the flow of the album. I definitally reccomend getting this album. Its one of those albums u blast while driving.My Fav's :9. Stay Down11. Blood in the Streets15. Keep the Gunz CockedMy Dislikes:16. Dale Poppi Dale18. So Serious
5,Very Helpful,I chose this rating because this book was very helpful in doing my study of Matthew. It added alot of insight and made clear some areas that I did not understand of the culture of the times!
1,UGGGGGGGGGGGH!!!,THIS MOVIE IS OLD AS DIRT AND IF I HAD REALIZED IT WHEN I WAS VIEWING IT I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SAMPLE OF A CHILD'S PLAY TYPE MOVIE. NOT!!!
5,Welcome Dante and Matthew Pearl,"After having read THE DANTE CLUB I was sorry that I had read it so quickly. I absolutely loved it. It has everything, adventures, mystery, knowledge. While reading it I was waiting for one of the characters to knock on the front door. After reading THE DANTE CLUB, THE POE SHADOW and THE LAST DICKENS, I want to thank Matthew Pearl for making real life authors and editors so real. I learned so much about the poets in the novel and the characters were so three dimensional that it was an absolute pleasure to read."
3,Maybe a little over-hyped?,"This review's title isn't meant to imply that Matthew Pearl didn't do a wonderful job writing this book. I simply was unable to finish the book quickly. I typically place a lot of emphasis on how fast I read a book. If I can't put a book down for more than an hour at a time and finish it within a few days, I've obviously greatly enjoyed the book.Now there are of course great books that one simply cannot finish in a matter of days. The Dante Club likely falls into this category. Period detail in this book is practically impeccable. Matthew Pearl was really able to portray old time Boston and Cambridge exactly how I have imagined them in my own mind.The plot is intricately woven and completely enthralling, once you get past the first murder anyways. I felt the story started off a little slow, but picked up to a satisfactory pace within just a few chapters.I did enjoy the book, though perhaps I was expecting something much more exciting with a lot more suspense."
3,Pearl's novel uneven and often contrived,"This may be worth a read if you are a Dante fan; however, it is heavy going. The plot has many stops and starts, and some of the characters serve no useful purpose. In addition to being uneven, it is often rather shallow and contrived. If you like a mystery story that zips along, this is certainly not for you."
3,Animatronic,"I couldn't finish this one. The Dante Club members were animatronic famous people - I couldn't tell any difference between Holmes, Lowell, and Longfellow. The black policeman hung about being noble and long-suffering. I suppose if you love Dante you'd like this book."
1,An insomnias drug free sleep aide!,"I had high expectations for this book. I took this book with me on my fight to Mexico to pass the time. I couldn't even get half way through the book. It was the most boring book that I have ever read in my life. The beginning was very promising. However, after about the first 100 pages this book was about as interesting as watching grass grow or paint dry. If you want to read it for yourself please save your money and check it out from the library."
1,"Too long, too boring...too bad","It is too bad this book isn't good because I had high hopes for it. You might not be able to explain why a book isn't good, you just know it. It's as if the author was above the book, maybe? It never got to a level of an entertaining read, at least for me. I'm glad I was given it and didn't waste the money. I won't be passing it on."
2,"If you're a pretentious non-reader, you might like it","The thought of great American poets getting together to solve a mystery Hardy Boys-style is ridiculous. I think the story might have been more interesting if I weren't constantly distracted by the goofiness of the poet-sleuth combination.I think the sort of people that would love this book are the same people that loved Dan Brown's DaVinci Code: people that feel that it makes them more educated because of the historical element. If you are an avid fiction reader, I recommend staying away from this one. It's silly."
2,Too slow,"I like smart books, but this is really a heavy load, overdone, endless sentences. You sense this author has potential, but I suggest you wait a few books."
2,Dante Dud,Starts off with a good murder scene and then drifts off into erudite intellectual fluff and nonsense which causes the murder mystery plot to disappear like dew in Dante's inferno. Very disappointing.
4,A very decent read.,"Kudos to Mr. Pearl. I'm a little leery of 19th century stories written by 21st century authors but this is well written and interesting. If was fun imagining the poets interacting and working together to solve a mystery. Just enough character development to make me want to learn more about them, read their poetry and read Dante."
3,Enjoyable Read,"I have been a Dante fan since reading Inferno ten years ago. As such, I enjoyed the weaving of Dante's work throughout this book very much. As some have noted, the book can get long in parts. However, I think it was generally a good read, and very rewarding for Dante fans."
4,"Brahmins, Intellectuals and Hell","For a first novel, Matthew Pearl's The Dante Club is astonishing in its readability, twists and turns, and general information about the Boston and Harvard environs during the post Civil War period. Real life characters (Holmes, Longfellow, Lowell, Eliot and more)are Dickension in nature, and the plot is similarly comparable. A book to be read carefully, the Dante Club is unique. Not a book for the faint of heart, the plot unfolds with a gruesome murder, minutely detailed, which is followed with more of the same. Academia, quotes from Dante, lowlife and highlife characters, all combine to create a soup of mystery and shock. For the reader who likes intellecutality combined with his or her mystery reading, this is such a book. I look forward to reading what Pearl concocts for his next work of fiction."
2,Couldn't finish...,I was anticipating a real page turner and ended up with a dud. It certianly had potential to be interesting but wasn't.
1,Avoid at all cost,"The story is extremely slow, I have so much problem finishing it. the writing style is absolutely horrendous. You would not believe that a published writer could've developed such uni-dimentional and boring plot. I've never finished the story nor planned to finish it. Before I sign off, I suggest that if you really have sleep problem such as insomina, you should pick up this one."
2,Dante for Dummies,"I picked this up hoping for an intelligent read, but instead got ""The Da Vinci Code"", rolled back 150 years.The idea is fine, the characters are interesting, but the execution is so mundane and the ending is so dull that I regret having spent all this time reading it.Murdering people based on Dante's Inferno is almost pointless. Dante depicts what happens to people when they die, based on what they did on Earth. Not now, on earth... If one has really grasped the Inferno, which the murderer is portrayed to have, he should know this. The Inferno and the Purgatory are Dante's way of justfying to himself the atrocities commited on earth. It's almost defeatist and certainly not provocative.I'm sure Pearl is many times better versed in Dante than I am, yet I can't help but think he tried to write Dante for Dummies and failed pretty badly.For an historical murder mystery, either read ""Instance of the Fingerpost"" or ""My Name is Red"" which both have much more substance than ""Dante Club""."
3,Like Eating Lo Carb Bread,"I read Dante immediately following Da Vinci Code and perhaps that is why I was a little disappointed with the former. While Dante is a suspenseful read, it does not quite measure up to Da Vinci. Both authors took a fairly fascinating subject and weaved credible fictions but Dante left me wanting more. In fact, reading Dante was like eating low carb bread - Tastes OK the first time you try it but then you realize something is missing."
1,Pompous and boring,"I read 30 pages into this book before I gave up... it took me 4 nights... I finish many books in a couple nights...It starts fine with an interesting murder with some amusing characters and a nice overall set up... but then it goes off on a bunch of tangents introducing many characters with no depth that all mushed together in my mind with their highfalutin literary refernces that I didn't get...I'm sure there are many people who enjoy high-brow literature will find a way to enjoy this (or at least convince themselves that they did). They would probably get the references and might eventually get all the characters straight, but it was just too much work for me when I just couldn't relate to any of the characters."
3,Hard to get into!,"The author's style was a bit hard to get into, so it took me a little while to realize all of the things going on in this book. Once I got into it (about 60 pages in) I really began to enjoy this book, and of course all that it combines (both famous american authors and thinkers as well as Dante). It was full of twists and turns and was indeed a thriller. But one needs to be a patient reader in order to appreciate it fully!"
4,Good read!,Very creative on presenting the gospel message. And it shows that evil can only prevail for so long before good conquers it and makes things new again.
3,Finally got it.,"I purchased this item on December 7th and didn't receive it until January 6th or 7th. I was dissapointed b/c this was a Christmas present. I will say that the contact person was good in responding to e-mails, but I most likely will not use this seller again merely for the shipping time."
1,"Great Book, Bad book cover","This is an excellent book. I am a huge fan of all Ted Dekker novels and would eagerly recommend his books to anyone. That being said, I was extremely disappointed with the physical quality of the book. I supposedly bought a ""new"" book from Amazon. When it arrived, however, the front cover was covered in scratches and one of the corners was bent. So just a word of warning...This is a bargain book, so you are getting what you pay for."
3,Violent & Bizarre,"I am a big Ted Dekker fan. He has an amazing ability to weave a unique, fascinating thriller with strong messages of Christian faith reflecting a great depth of spiritual wisdom and awareness. I have found most of his novels hard to put down (I read Three straight through in one night), however, I have to say that I found Showdown a bit hard to stomach. It was violent and increasingly gross and bizarre. I have passed out his other books to many others but would not recommend this one."
3,Showdown with so-so writing,"The Paradise series is an extension of the Circle series, so naturally I was expecting good story telling in a series that has mostly thrived. However, the story starts off decent, and begins on a decline that continues to the very end of the series. From virtually the beginning, Dekker delivers unrealistic situations and unbelievable dialog and interaction that makes the book difficult to enjoy. It may work for simple minded reading that will not make you think, but it felt like he was trying to create something bigger than simple and it disappointed. As a fan of Dekker and the Circle series, this was a disappointing addition the Book of Histories saga."
4,cool,"First off, I should tell you that some fans of Dekker's Circle Trilogy may be dissapointed. This novel isn't as weird as the Circle Trilogy is (weird in a good way) but it is related to the trilogy; the books of history are a mayjor part of the plot. This book is better for people with good imaginations (there are dungeons that aren't described incredible well) but is very enjoyable. A very unique and interesting idea (kids secluded in a monastery from birth and sheilded from evil). Dekker has written better books in his time (e.g. Saint, Circle Trilogy, Thr3e) but it is definetly worth the read. It's an important peice of the puzzle in the 10-book Books of History super series (Black, White, Red, Showdown, Saint, soon to be released Choosen, Infidel, Renegade, Chaos, and Sinner). Dive deep."
4,Good Book to get you going,"I would have given this book 5 stars if it were more complex. I don't claim to be a Photoshop expert at this time but this book is really good for getting up and running quickly and the authors obviously put a great deal of thought and time into the creation of this book.It takes one to know one. As an author, instructor and translator you can see the organization that went on to simply present a complex software for new users.Well Done. Not a book for advanced users but well done."
3,Mixed Emotions,"It took me awhile to decide how I should rate this book. I think Naipaul is clearly very talented and his writing is fantastic. He has this fantastic ability to really demonstrate the tension that can be created during drastic change. However, I find his storytelling to be lacking. It starts out well but then goes nowhere. I feel like even Naipaul was getting bored with the story so he would throw in random nonsense like beating up a woman or some random storyline that would never really be resolved.Salim is a big problem for me as a main character. He is extremely complicated, which is important, but he seems to be very static and is just about always acted upon. When he does decide to do something it seems to come out of nowhere and there is no logical reason behind his action.I can't decide if I will keep this book or get rid of it once and for all. I have very mixed feelings but I would recommend that you read this if only for the writing"
3,It was all right.,"I bought this CD at Half Price Book without really looking carefully. I was actually looking for Fantasie (for four hands) D940. For some stupid reason I didn't expect this one to be four hand works. So when I first played it, I said to myself, ""oh, what's wrong with this? Is the piano out of tune?"" Then I realized that there were four hands involved. The two performers used only one piano, so it really couldn't be the piano's fault if it sounded out of tune. The difference of tones and colors of the two performers is what made it sound like out of tune, I think. Once this understood, I accepted it as it was.The next problem I faced was the selection of the works. I got tired of the poundings of marches after a while. All pieces are pretty much energetic, go go go!, and not very lyrical.Over all they did a fine job, but I will have to wait a while before I'll listen to it again."
2,So-So,"This CD only plays clips of his songs, not the whole song. If you want the full version of the song, buy another CD."
4,Not great but very good.,"Not much of a theme (aside from nude models). You get the sense he more wanted to publish a book of many of the current top models(Fall of 1999). And not so in making a photographic statement.The photos are also developed in a very pale (annoying) form. I guess to give the illusion of art? Too bad really. Photography doesn't need to be about art. Just interesting. And interesting this book is. Beautiful current top models.. who can you go wrong? Whether it's Devon Aoki thinking she's the Venus. Audrey Marnay and her over-exaggerated scared expression. Milla looking like she just woke up. Kristen Owen and her show stealing ""out of the shower"" look. Or Tasha Tilberg just standing there. Where Paolo lacks a theme, the models improvise, some better than others. But all beautiful. Over forty pages! Well over 30 different models! Worth checking out if you like fashion."
2,Some inaccuracies,I agree with the lower reviews that this book still needs some fixes. It is pretty repetitive but that is the least of my concerns. Some defined words fall out of the accepted definition that most would accept. The worst offense is on page 44 of chapter 3 when it defines nation. This is not in lone with what most political scientist would use to define nation. It is more a definition of state and things like this can be confusing to novice social scientist who know nothing of the political sciences arena of social science.
4,Engineered the World : And Made a Lot of Money At It Too.,"An excellent book that provides an interesting insider's view into one of the largest engineering and construction firms of modern times. From the Hoover Dam to the Middle East to the United States Government, this book shows how the Bechtel Corporation did what it wanted to, when it wanted to, and used whom it wanted to as long as it made the few controlling members of it's management very rich. And all this was training for the government deals to come. This book offers a historical detailing of this company's ethical and social violations as well as the building of an empire. Read it."
3,This book is ok.,I just finished reading this book and the main complaint I have is that it wasn't in depth enough. You get to the part where the author mentions Bechtel was involved in a CIA sponsored coup to overthrow the regime in Syria and this gets like only four paragraphs- 200 words at the most- and he moves on. Something like that should be a 20 pages at least in my opinion and many of the chapters feel have a similar feel to it. Overall since there are not many books written on this subject I feel overall the book is worth reading.
5,JUST BUSINESS - NOT PERSONAL,"Bechtel? Who? No one really knew that this multi-million (probably billion) dollar corporation existed until Laton McCartney had the courage to do his homework and publish his findings. After the publishing there was objection by Bechtel and the book disappeared. Now it is back, and I for one am quite satisfied with this outcome. As I already had an original copy I purchased this copy for a friend. The information within is unsullied by the objections.

1,Not a Follette Best,"Previously reviewed - very humble for this Author. For some reason, the review was never published (might it not have been up to Amazon standards).If the Board has a problem with negative reviews, then don't ask for one."
3,Not As Expected,"After reading some of the previous reviews saying this book had too many characters, I should have paid attention and taken notes on who's who. It kept you in suspense as the plot had each of the characters interwoven in the quest for ""Paper Money"" . It's also a very short book, I'm a Ken Follett fan and always have given his books a five star but this one was disappointing, but it was one of his first."
3,An intiguing story about how corruption connects us all.,"The novel paper money is an intriguing novel which describes a single day in the world of a bustling newspaper company. Follet's method of character description and presentation in which he introduces each character in their their own light, is an effective, yet sometimes confusing way of developing the novel's characters. The novel as a whole is a refreshing story which is sure to delight, yet the inadequate ending of the book may cause its readers to yearn for a sense of closure."
5,Werewolves ~ Mythological or Madmen?,"This is a highly entertaining and informative read about the basis of werewolf mythology, examining common features of the myth around the world.The first 60% of the book details the various tales of werewolves and their characteristics and the later 40% details the authors idea that werewolves are are simply men driven into a sort of primal rage and hallucinating.Great read, highly recommended."
3,Middle of the pack,"For the most part this is a good, but uneventful performance. Some intonation issues as one might expect, but nothing horrible. Halasz takes the 3rd movement at a decent clip and the solo cello is a bit timid and out of tune. Recording quality is nice and warm. I just can't get real excited about this version."
2,Elastic Heel Strap,I returned this sandal. I did not know that the heel strap was elastic. My feet were not secure in the sandal.
4,Almost great Propet sandal.,"This Propet Surf Walker was purchased because it got generally good reviews, it was fairly priced and it was available in wide sizes. The sandal is very comfortable and seems very well made to last. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that (and someone else mentioned this also) that the strap that goes around behind and above the heel is a bit short, forcing the foot just a little far forward. The adjusting strap in front of the ankle does not make any difference and there is little ""give"" to this back strap. This seems odd at first but it has not affected the comfort of the sandal in actual use.I am a female purchaser of mostly men's shoes. Used to be that just being men's they would be a bit wider than women's. As I get older, that bit, is no longer wide enough. Thanks to Propet for offering more choices in wide sizes."

4,From Chunk to Hunk: Diary of a Fat Man,"Being a long time fan of Fred's writing on his website, I was anxious to get his book and hear the story from the beginning. Fred has a great sense of humor and tells things as they are. He makes you think about weightloss in a simpler way, ignoring the fad diets of today. I really enjoyed the book and hope to use it as a tool to remind myself to take better care of myself."
1,"""Derivative"" isn't enough","I went through a Norman Vincent Peale/Tony Robbins/David St. Clair phase at one point, so I'd already basically read this book. Perhaps he meant to give credits, or is so saturated with the message that he forgot where specific analogies come from, but that's one of the pitfalls of self-publishing. So is repetition. The same ""look-where-you-want-to-go"" story about steering into a pole is told twice as if it happened to different people, making it seem likely that it never happened to anyone.It's a good synopsis of the standard motivational-speaker stuff though, which at this point is always derivative, and it does have what seems to be a true story laced into it. It was a good goal, I'm glad he got to it, love the before-and-after pictures, but there's no book here."
4,an obvious mentor not mentioned!,"Fred! I really liked your book, I gave it to my husband as I really think it will help him to do what you did, what I am doing and what, whom I am sure it both of ours, mentor did---I read your book KNOWING that you have read works by Julia Griggs Havey! She is eDiets motvator and you write too much like her to have not read her works!Your book is GREAT, don't get me wrong. I am sure you are going to help many men....but come on Fred....where did you derive some of your material?!"
5,Definitely motivating!,"Having become familiar with Fred's unique brand of humorous writing from his website, I wasn't quite prepared for this book. I had thought it might be more of a day-to-day account of his weight loss journey, but it is much more than that. It is full of common sense ideas for self motivation, imparted in an easy to accept manner. I have already lost most of my excess weight over the past year (105 pounds) using plenty of the methods Fred has found successful. I do think this book would have been helpful to me as a great inspiration during the times I struggled with staying on plan, and I really enjoyed riding along with Fred on his journey to good health and hunkdom.I think Fred should write another book, similar to the ongoing website journal he maintains, because I believe he is a talented writer with a remarkable ability to poke fun at himself and to find humor in everyday events. (Okay, Robyn, can you pay me now? Just kidding!)"
4,If you have Sly then you need this book!,"If you have Sly Cooper then you definately need this book! It has lot's of helpful hints and will get you out of the binds, twists and turns that you will get into and can't get out of! This book is affordable as are all the other strategy books and you can even get used ones that are in great condition for less money.This book is good and helpful!"
3,Well...,"Listen, Sly Cooper isn't a really hard game. The only use for this strategy guide is to find all the clue bottles. That's it! The pictures are so small it's not even worth it and most of the pictures don't even match what they're talking about! The entire section on the giant-monster-thing has photos from a completely different area! So, if you like to get EVERYTHING in a game, buy this. If not, DON'T..."
3,ANOTHONY BURNES: THE BRAVEST SLAVE ALIVE,"""Wham! The little boys head snapped sideways, with a agonizing jolt. His eyes rested upon his master, with hatred and disgust, mixed with fear written in his eyes. The master showed no emotion, just smiled and hit the boys throbbing head again. Little did the master know who that boy was: Anthony Burns."" Virginia Hamilton's Anthony Burns always has a little suprise popping up all over and because it is a chronicle of a slave's life, has a long string of dates. On these dates Anthony grew, and kept the will to live deep within his soul and never gave up. He was a slave and out of 28 years only nine years of his life were free. That is really sad. I enjoyed the book, and I hope that you do, or did, also."
2,a disgrace to anthony!,"first, i would like to acknowledge that anthony burns and the story of anthony burns are great. with that aside, i can now say that the book....WAS AWFUL. it was easy, yet confusing. plus, it was not very deep at all. i learned nothing new. nothing at all. not reccomended for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary. not reccomended period."
5,Old InfoChase Only Better,Same Company. New Product. Better Product. I've been using them for 2 years now for my direct mail campaigns.
4,Little Keyboard that Can,"I use this keyboard to connect toArchos 70 - 8 GB Internet Tablet (Black)using micro A male to USB A Female converter. It works well, I can type full length document using QuickOffice for android. I can even use it for playing games (android games and emulators).The keys need to be stroke harder than usual but if you get used to it, you will have no problems. The USB cable is a bit larger though so you may want toNow where can I find leather case that can fit both this keyboard and theArchos 70 - 8 GB Internet Tablet (Black):) ?"
1,"Nuh uh, no way.","I'll keep this brief.The keys are very stiff, and after several months of use, it does not get any better. The keys are also very compact. If you medium to large size hands, it is difficult to compact your fingers enough to use this comfortably. Speaking of comfort, this keyboard is an ergo nightmare.I'm not a fan, and am looking to replace this company supplied item with something more comfortable to use, but fits in my laptop bag for travel."
1,Baffled,"When I received this product, I expected everything to go perfectly from the awesome reviews I read. My product's rubber gasket is TOO BIG, there is no possible way it can fit. I am extremely disappointed."
5,GREAT QUALITY,I'm NOT a professional baker but enjoy making cookies for my family and get togethers. This xmas season I decided I would make tins of cookies and candies for my clients. A cookie recipe suggested buying a spring loaded scoop. I did a little research and found this set of three. I have to tell you I've been using them for a month and these are the way to go. Even if you don't bake very often. You scoop and then I roll the dough in my hands and bake them. The AMAZING THING is that each cookie is the same exact size!!!! VERY NICE FOR PACKAGING!~!! These are the only scoop you will need to buy for your lifetime. I couldn't imagine this scoop ever breaking. Its made very well!!
5,"Move over, Lemuel Gulliver!","Make room for Arthur Dent, the unlikely hero of Douglas Adams' four-book trilogy. Although it bogs down at times, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy is usually fast-paced satire at its best."
1,I only counted 572 maniacs ......,"The effects are dated, the acting is atrocious, the setting is God-awful, but in it's day, it was a cult favorite.I don't reccommend it for the ""sophisticated"" slasher movie followers of today."
1,A movie nasty,"I have seen this movie and I had no approval. The ending is terrible to be honest with you. Even if they made a remake of that movie, there should be no animal cruilty and the ending should be different. This movie makes me think of famous serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy; Charles Starkweather; Clifford Olsen; Ed Gein; Jeffery Dahmer and famous woman serial killer Aileen Wurnoes aka Aileen Pitman."
2,Not as great as expected,"The long date fame that follows this movie and made me buy a copy aroused probably too many expectations that failed to be met. In my opinion, even put aside the poor fx (due to the time the movie was made), the poor acting and the few (and scarcely explicit) slaughter scenes don't allow a 5 (or even 4) star rating. The idea was interesting and maybe the sequel (I haven't seen yet) has developed it better, but I came from this vision quite disappointed. It still deserves a place in my collection, due at least to its historic significance (I did not suppose such kind of movie possible at such early date). Some unlikely and illogic points and only one suspense scene contribute to put the rating down."
1,Quirky Camera - get something different,"Has trouble with disc formating and playback in general, not to mention the quirky steps needed to ""finalize"" a dics to be played elswhere or transfered to your computer you need a special cord, which plugs into your battery charger of all things, and then from the charger into the wall. If you loose that cord like I have - you're screwed, you can't any movies out of the camera - the discs won't play in any dvd player and you are just SOL."
2,Waste of Money!!,Battery life is horrible! Formatting discs are a nuisance. Very disappointed!Beware before buying!
1,"How a book can create a conflict, Said and his gross mistrepretations","Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this ""vintage"" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear."
1,The Old Stone Thrower Is At It Again,"The old stone thrower is at it again, expounding his one-sided, biased view of history. Said made a career of being a highly-visible defender of the Palestinians; was even a member of the PLO executive council. Too bad he was silent about Yasir Arafat's theft of hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the Palestinians. He would rather blame the Jews for the Palestinians misfortunes, which they were the SOLE author of. What hypocrisy!"
3,Funny and enjoyable but not 5 stars for gosh sakes...,"Read it in the airport and on a flight from Boston to the midwest, so it's a very quick read. It was very funny, but didn't stay with me. Sort of like having a conversation with an interesting seatmate on an airplane. It passes the time, (or in this case, make a living for the author) and is amusing, but just that.This book consists of brief, supposedly autobiographical essays from a year in his life. I wonder how much was true, and how much was strictly his vivid imagination. I hope this author does write the great american novel, since I really like his style, but I won't recommend this book to most people."
5,Peter Hits Paydirt,"As someone who grew up with Peter and followed his post-college escapades with amusement, I think I speak for all of his friends by offering our congrulations on this effort. When we were young, Peter displayed the same sharp/biting wit and droll sense of humor that is currently reflected in the book. Well before the term ""metrosexual"" became part of the American cultural lexicon, while we grew up during the 80s, Peter was indeed VERY ""metrosexual""--and was ahead of his time in doing so! I encourage anyone who grew up in the 70s, went to school in the 80s, and tried to figure out exactly what the hell our generation was supposed to be doing in the 90s (and beyond) to purchase this book. Congrats again, Peter!"
5,Cult Classic,"The Reluctant Metrosexual: Dispatches from an Almost Hip Life is a stellar first book for this author. Hyman's writing gives readers an honest and humorous look into his life making it as addictive as it is funny. Each essay will have you laughing out loud and at the end wanting to read just a few more pages. With his combination of witty remarks and perfect descriptions of life, this book is sure to become a cult classic for those in the know."
1,The voice doesn't match the vibe ...................,"I bought this after reading strong reviews, despite reservations after listening to samples. I should have trusted my ears. I suspect her following is based more on genre loyalty and lifestyle issues rather than the music.Her voice is surprisingly hard and inflexible, although it has its moments. My copy is going to charity to be re-cycled to a listener who might enjoy it more than me."
4,shoot for the moon,to succeed one must hire the stupid to confound the wise......3...2....1....ignition ....and lift off.....
4,pretty good!,"I bought these because I was trying to find some truffles that I had tried one time and wasn't sure if it was these ones or the Donchels truffles. They're pretty similar, but I'm pretty sure that the Donchels are the ones I had tried and really loved. These are definitely good, though, but the Donchel's has coconut oil in them which I think is a little higher quality and perhaps somewhat healthier. Anyways, they're good though."
4,Tasty chocolate treat,"Quite delecious. I still prefer easily available, cheaper and tastied Lindt white chocolates though."
1,"Misleading title, made in Canada, NOT France","After having had truffles that were made in and from France, we ordered these believing they would be similar. They were not. The label is deceptive at worst, misleading at best."
1,Shipping out of sight,I learned after the fact that the same product was 2.98 cheaper at a wholesale club and the $9.98 was a rip-off. I will never order from this company again and I hope Amazon takes them off their vendor list.
1,"Melted together as one lump, tasted like wax...","I've had good truffles before that looked very similar, but these were disgusting. They tasted waxy and were melted into one lump that I had to break up. It was some of the worst chocolate I've ever tasted and I had to spit it out."
5,love it,These are fabulous. love love love them. They are a big hit at work but I have to hide them!!!
2,"Common truffle, just this, not worth the price.","The only thing special is that they really melt in the mouth, but just this. Ordinary flavor. Could not finish even half bag.Try Leonidas or Godiva instead."
5,Great book.,Great book. Very informative and easy to follow. I can't wait to start my ultimate body detox!
3,"Good characters, good setting, dreadful plot","As in the first Greg Mandel book, ""Mindstar Rising"", the characters and setting are excellently drawn. I enjoyed returning to the dystopian near-future version of England, just recovering from years of dictatorship and environmental problems. Some of the characters are very interesting, notably the Mindstar veterans Greg and Gabriel, and some of the Trinities people (Suzi, Teddy, Royan). It's just the plot of this novel ... I'm used to fantasy and science fiction plots being really really ""out there"", but this one pushes it a bit too far. I don't want to spoil the story here, but the final shootout almost made me throw the book down in disgust. I will read the third Mandel book, but I really hope it'll be a bit more plausible than ""A Quantum Murder""."
5,THE NEXT FANTASY,I L0VEE THIS PERFUME! it smells so nice its more on the sexy side then fresh. it smells a lot like fantasy. i love the bottle it looks very nice everything is a 10/10. the smell is just sooo good!!! the thing that im sorta mad about is that it didnt come with that little pink tube where i just squeeze it to make the perfume come out. other then that i love it the smell is soft yet strong
4,Don't Let the Extra Tracks Fool You,"Every ""Cowboy"" release I've ever seen in the US has ""Rapture"" and ""Magic Moments"". Certainly, it contains fine ballads, but only a couple of songs worth dancing to, and you can't dance to those unless you buy the dance remixes! This album had to grow on me before I could listen to it entirely. Much like the two Erasure albums before it, ""Cowboy"" contains haunting melodies I love to sing along to. If ""Innocents"" was your favorite, stay away from this. If you loved ""Erasure 1996"" or ""I Say I Say I Say"" then you'll like ""Cowboy"""
4,Review #64: Genasis 6:4 Nefilem(64=N14+E5+F6+I9+L12+E5+M13),"Is it a 'coincidence' that this is Review #64 and in Genasis 6:4 is the reference to 'Nefilem'(64=N14+E5+F6+I9+L12+E5+M13)? I have not read this book, but I just watched 'Ancient Aliens', 'Angels and Aliens' on History Channel and this author was interviewed. I may read his book(s).The Planet Nestor is our 'next-door neighbors' and their earth is built(64=B2+U21+I9+L12+T20) on FOD=6_4. This is part of 'Seal #2: Plan-it Theory of GOD=7_4 or FOD=6_4 (on PlanEt Nestor) - Design Worlds Theory'. Google that. I presented it as a one-page-paper/poster at the NASA Conference 'Missions for Exoplanets: 2010-2020' held in Pasadena 4.21.09 ."
4,I didn't give it enough recognition the first time,"When I wrote my first review of this book I was a little dissapointed but now that I think about it this book was extremely good; for a first time effort from a Christian writer. Yes, again the dialogue is pretty lame but what can you work with if you're writing a Christian book about modern times-tough! I think that Marzulli did an excellent job. The scripture references are accurate and the reader should not be discouraged by any of the other biblical text. I also said, armed with the mind-what was I thinking! This book was probably meant to stress Marzulli's personal opinion on the power of prayer. Hats off Marzulli to a wonderfull first-time effort!"
1,Let me catch my breath,"There are enough self-proclaimed ""management bestsellers,"" and this one is too effusive and devoid of original content, from the boxed pundit words of wisdom, to the ""terrific"" blurbs from the people glowingly spotlighted within. Southwick's myopia is perhaps best captured by her claim that ""the Regis Touch"" transformed Apple. Maybe it was too long ago to remember, but back then, having an actual product made a difference. The idea that things are now moving so fast that intellectual property doesn't matter any more is ludicrous.The work seems primarily descriptive, rather than prescriptive, making it ironically backward-looking, and already dated."
1,"A Couple Years Later, This Is Irrelevant","This is a somewhat entertaining read if you can get over the basic fact that the information is outdated. Almost all of the statistics are from 1998 and some of the companies cited as future stars never realized their potential. It was relevant in 1999 but quickly lost all significance in the dot-com meltdown of 2000 that is still continuing as I write this in 2001. Dot-coms now require a path to profitability and companies just don't engage in the same behaviors any more.This books still has value for anyone wanting to know some historical background from the times of ""irrational exhuberance"" but the changes in business priorities that have taken place since this book was written have doomed it to irrelevance."
2,Interesting content - shoddy pictures.,"As one of the comparatively few in norway training in this style of karate I eagerly awaited the arrival of this well presented dvd. The contents, however, hardly enhanced my understanding of karate in general or Chito ryu as such. As a historic document this may have some merit though, but the quality of the images and the films makes it almoust impossible to enjoy this film. The films are old, yellow and noone have taken the time to even try to make them better suited for a digital and unforgiving media.Sadly."
1,Not The Title I ordered,I ordered A History Of Europe By J. M. Roberts. I received Europe Inc. What happened?!? I guess I have to deal with returning this book I didn't order back.
2,Aspect Ratio on Warner's release is Full Frame,"The movie itself is a classic, but the aspect ratio for this Warner Bros release is incorrectly labeled as widescreen when it is actually full frame. I'm surprise no other reviewer has noticed this. Hopefully I can find a copy of the initial Anchor Bay release which I know is the correct aspect ratio because I used to own it. If you don't care about watching this in full screen, by all means pick it up."
3,Classic David Carradine,"An intense adult drama, with a common plot element of an ""innocent"" female traveller (Ally Sheedy) who gets jailed in a southern jail on trumped-up charges, raped and beaten and otherwise abused by her captors, until another inmate (David Carradine) steps in (through the cell bars), grabs the bad cop, (who ends up dead) and the escape is on. The Sheriff is the usual dirty cop, who pursues the escapees ruthlessly, with Ally Sheedy's character resorting to more & more crime in her desperation to get away from the hell she's experienced, all the while being helped by, but not quite trusting, Carradine's ex-con. The violent subject matter makes it understandable why no one under 18 is allowed to buy this movie here, but all in all, it's a decent flick of its genre, with good performances by the leads."
1,Macon County Line,"I'm always intersted in movies about the ""OLD"" South and the way things were before the sixties. While I enjoyed the story, but the foul language always disappoints me in a movie. I have heard all the F'n words, but don't need to hear it coming from my TV."
4,"gins,o steak knives","great quality, well made and well worth the price. should last a lifetime.The package of six not four is excellent."
3,You get what you pay for,"Cheap set of knives. Worked fine for about a year or so (have had them for about 3 years), and are now very dull - even though they are supposed to never need sharpening. The good - they are still a nice silver color (I wash them by hand or they spot - could be my dishwasher) and solidly constructed - heavy. They also work okay for use with an individual steak or chop on your plate - with a little more pressure than should be required. The bad - they can't cut a tomato into nice slices anymore!!! I was hoping they would have stayed sharper longer - but they didn't. They look decent in their block on the counter. Would I buy them again - yes - if I didn't want to spend a lot of money and needed something that would look and feel decent .... but I'd buy a good knife (singular) for the important slicing jobs."
5,Great knives - Good price,"I bought this set as an adjunct to the Ginsu knife set with block (that comes with six of these same steak knives), as I needed to complete a service for eight. They are of the same quality - nice weighty feel and very sharp. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on cutlery, and I feel that I got a great deal for what I did spend on these."
5,One of Grafton's best,"Best of the series from A through G. Grafton's writing has matured in this engrossing mystery, and if you're a fan of the series, don't miss this one."
2,G is for Godawful,This is one of the few Kinsey Millhone mysteries that I found extremely boring. It rambled on and on and on with no real plot or case for Kinsey to solve. It had some intrigue with the hit man and Deitz but some how Grafton was not able to pull it together into a comprehensive tale. All in all it was a real let down.
4,"an unusually large story for Grafton, and well-executed","In this seventh installment of Kinsey Millhone's adventures as a private detective, Kinsey has much more on her plate than usual. She is hired to locate a client's elderly mother, who has disappeared; she also discovers that someone is trying to have her killed. The first challenge develops in unexpected ways, and the search for Kinsey's would-be killer is a well-integrated secondary plot. The whole thing is bound up in Grafton's usual competent, easy-to-read writing.The book's only shortcoming is that it could have been much more than it was. It is essentially two stories coincident in time and both involving Kinsey; no thematic connection between them is evident. While this does not detract from the novel's enjoyability, it leaves some doubt as to why Grafton introduced a second story element rather than elaborating a bit more on the first."
3,"Good, but...","As good as any plastic safety glasses. Of course, they all eventually get scratched and the dust accumulation from static can be extremely annoying. These lasted a couple of weeks before I scratched them somehow and ended up buying glass lens safety glasses."
3,A Soap Opera in Print,"I read this book to the end. It was not hard reading. I have read the other reviews and seen this book lauded and seen it thrashed. It is not my kind of reading but I don't suppose I was the target audience. It was well-written and easy to follow and I was sure glad to finish it so I could move on to something I could really sink my teeth into. This story was vacuous, cliched, and with the most uninteresting characters, and the most inane descriptions ever - PERFECT for summer beach reading. Hence, the 3 stars. I would absolutely recommend it for relaxing at the beach on a short holiday, but don't expect anything of substance beyond that."
2,"Flat characters, sloppy writing/editing","The storylines weren't bad (though as one reviewer said, maybe too many of them going on). But the characters had no depth, none was very interesting. And there were lots of repetitive scenes, continuity errors, and just plain typos. A little hard to get through."
4,Very Entertaining,"Lots of character story lines, but writer makes them work. Not a page turner, but very entertaining."
3,Summer Lite,Pure beach read. Nice sense of summer life at a Nantucket resort. Not nearly as well crafted as her newest book (The Love Season) but worthy as the perfect tonic for a relaxing summer day.
3,Lots of places; very little info,"This isn't a bad book at all. I just had a different idea of what it would include. If you are truly looking for a directory of places all across the country and you plan to do some traveling, this is your book. However, if you're like me and plan to do more reading than traveling, this isn't the book for you. It really, truly is a directory. Think phone book...it has the location names, addresses and a few sentences on the locations' haunted activity. If that's what you're looking for, buy this book. However, if you're looking for an enjoyable read - this one isn't it. Again, it really is a directory."
4,"Good alternative to Berman, Cziffra, Bolet, et al.","Naxos' ""in-house pianist"" turns out a more than satisfactory performance in this second volume of three ""Years of Pilgrimage"" albums, in part due to the comparative lack of pastoral imagery--lyricism is not Jando's forte. Received a Penguin Rosette (for what it's worth). Recorded sound is fine, with Venezia e Napoli being the standout performance on this disc."
3,Not Bad.....,"A by-the-numbers thriller aimed at the family market (no real violence, the lead is a teenage girl). Familes concerned with what their kids get exposed to won't mind it. Anyone else will find it satisfactory, in that it keeps moving and usually keeps things in order:no outlandish plot twists or exasperating acts of stupidity to keep the suspense going. However, it is rather perfuctionary and, inevitably, disposable entertainment."
1,AWFUL,"I thought this would be funny cause ""Jamie Foxx"" headlines this ~ it is the worse MESS I have ever seen! NONE of the material is funny! Damn shame..."
1,not worth it,"Just go to WalMart and buy the SmartyKat - cheaper, faster and BETTER!! Can't believe we waited almost TWO WEEKS to get this junk -it is so IMpotent, both cats couldn't care less for it!"
2,High Quality Boredom.,"The quality of the writing here is excellent but the story and characters are very boring.It is the quality of the writing, alone, that can get you to continue reading beyond say the first 50 pages, however there is no big pay off at the end.No punctuation is a travesty; a time waster in an otherwise dreary read."
5,My favorite!,"I own recordings of Brahms 2nd piano concerto by Schnabel, Watts, and Jando. Out of these three, Jando's is my definite favorite. Schnabel's recording is amazing for the extremely fast tempos, but the poor sound quality ruins the CD. I prefer Jando's over Watts's because Jando plays the first movement a little bit faster than Watts does, and I think the sound quality is better on Jando's recording too. I highly recommend this CD.The track lengths are as follows:1st movement - 17:152nd movement - 9:073rd movement - 11:464th movement - 9:08Schumann's Introduction and Allegro appassionato - 14:09"
5,Insightful and exhaustively documented,"Professor Young has done a superb job in collating how different scholars have responded to the Old Testament flood account through the centuries in the light of extra-Biblical data. This detailed study was largely in response to the rise of support in the last 40 years among some (not all) Christians for the global as an explanation for much of the geological record. Young shows repeatedly how this recent phenomenon is out of step with the way Christian scholars have dealt with extra-Biblical data over the last two millennia. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in the interaction between science and Christianity, in the history of geology, and in modern young earth creationism."
2,Of Limited Overall Value,"The author does a fairly good job describing the history of the church's understanding of the Noachian Deluge. With few exceptions, the Flood had been accepted as universal. Then, in response to the rationalistic preconceptions of recent centuries, the church has largely backed away from Biblical truth, and settled for a local-flood compromise. Sadly, Davis Young, the author, himself is part of this compromising-evangelical community. In particular, his claims that the Ark could never have carried all of the world's animals is patently incorrect. See Woodmorappe, John. 1996. Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study."
3,Beware of the MISSING PURPLE CONTROLLER,Okay. Good unit. Could have gone to the store and bought it and that way I would not have to wait another 7-10 days after the initial 5-7 days for the controller that they forgot to send.

2,"Not Bad, but VHS Tracking is Terrible","I bought this box set because I had seen these episodes when I was very young and really like them at the time. Turns out that they voice acting on these videos is absolutly terrible. The inflection and traslations are very juvenile, much more so than I remembered. But then again, I was quite young last time I watched it.The biggest problem that I ran into was the tracking. I have two VCRs with auto tracking and tried them on both and at least twice per episode the tracking would get so bad that the screen would go blank before the tracking could catch back up and the quality was pretty poor through out all of the episodes.All in all, not bad, but I'm sending it back since since it wasn't what I was expecting between the quality of the video and the voice acting."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book thinking that it contain info on tips & techniques, as well as detailed plans; I was wrong.The 127 pages are filled with color photos of interesting boxes, but not much else. There is a materials list for each piece, but no plans or instructions beyond a stylized isometric sketch.If you are looking for a book on boxes to decorate your coffee table, this is the one. If you are looking for a practicle guide to box construction, look elsewhere."
2,Pales in Comparison to the Film,"Wings is the story of a small town boy (Jack) and a wealthy one (David) from the same town who go to war (WWI) and become ace pilots. They're missed by their sweethearts at home; both boys are in love with Sylvia but she loves David, and Mary loves Jack. Both of them just want to make good with the military.As a fan of the film Wings, I wanted to read the book version written by the talented John Monk Saunders. His wit is present in sparse segments, but for the most part, this novel reads like a rough draft. It reads, ""And then this happened. And then this happened. And then this happened..."" without enough character development in between. The result is a pale likeness to a brilliant film. I'd recommend seeing that and avoiding this."
5,Impressive router,"Using VoIP? Meager upstream bandwidth? [For me thats 256k upload]. Well,I have found a router that finally has some smarts! Without even looking to configure my VoIP service from Voicepulse, this router handles traffic like advertised. Voice quality was great, even as I tried to degregate my bandwidth with large file uploads. Wireless signal and performance is superb, even with router in basement. Overall throughput is handled well. Best of all, even with out of the box fw ver 1.4, I've not needed any reboots, other than change password, or other certain config changes. I'll live with that! My stack of used routers are now 'out the door'!"
5,My box of joy,"I bought this after reading extensive reviews of different routers and decided on this one because of a number of reviewers saying that it worked well with their Vonage device, among other glowing attributes. Well, I couldn't be happier with this router. I'm no technophile, to be sure, but I know when something is working correctly. Since installing the router 3 months ago I haven't had ANY dropped internet connections, no Vonage issues, no problems whatsoever. I haven't even once had to go through the whole disconnect/reconnect madness that I had to go through all the time with my last junkbox router. This router replaced a Netgear piece of junk that had me dreaming of putting it out in the driveway and running over it with my car (no anger-management issues here). I won't go on, just suffice it to say that this is one great wireless router. Worth every penny."
2,Broken after 18 mos,"This router was great while it worked: MAC address filtering, WPA encryption, good signal thoughout our house, fairly easy to configure.As reported by many owners on New Egg's site, though, this wireless router shipped with defective power supplies. Mine was one of them. Bad capacitors that burst. Zyxel was responsive and sent the power supply without having me RMA mine back.Nevertheless, now, after trying to configure it to work with a new DSL modem, it has frozen up. Did a firmware upgrade and now the router won't open a webpage for configuration. It won't even do a manual reset! So, my next wireless router will probably be a Linksys."
5,Wonderful and Reliable Wireless Router!,"I have used a Netgear wireless router (model WGT624 v3) and was TOTALLY disappointed with this product. It had lousy range and ALWAYS crashed on me. I had to reset this router (unplug and plug back in) MANY times - what a pain! However, after reading the review on the Zyxel X-550 router, I decided to buy it (great price too). I have been using it for at least 6 months now and NEVER had any trouble with it. A GREAT router! Plus it has a handy switch on the back to turn the wireless signal on/off if you need extra privacy when not using the router.Also, I would HIGHLY recommend using the Network Magic software that comes with the router. This software makes setting up your wireless network - including file sharing and printer sharing - VERY EASY! This software is especially good for those (like me) that don't understand how to do all this through the complicated windows XP (or Vista)software.Great product and great price - you won't be disappointed!"
5,A new step forward for Marillion,"I've been listening to marillion for the past two years and every time I listen to a new album I feel they're one of the greatest bands in the world.. I really can't figure out why Marillion is so sub-valorated! Anoraknophobia is an exceptional work wih both beautiful and accesible rock music. I'm really glad to see that marillion continues evolving in each album they release. Don't be afraid of the lenght of the tracks (give them a chance they'll get better each time you listen to them) and PLEASE don't be afraid to discover this great and subvalorated band with this album, probably one of their best works."
2,"Pretentious as ever, but not that good as they used to be!","I've got no idea why Marillion is trying so hard to sound like pretentious acts such as Radiohead, Massive Attack, and all these other hyped bands from England. I can understand their financial problems, but that's no reason to sell your heart and soul. I would have been way much better to create something that is their own. Don't get me wrong, because it's another good thing to make innovative. However, Marillion is not that kind of band, because their are best in doing what they've done with magical records such as Clutching at Straws, Misplaced Childhood, and Afraid of Sunlight. Another problem with this latest release is the chaotic structure of the music. Whatever happened to the song writing? Endless pieces of music combined with useless sound fragments. The singing of Steve Hogarth fails to impress as well. I'm sorry to say, but Marillion it ain't. All I hear is a bunch of old rocker trying to be hip."
1,Marillion sell out,"This is a caricature of what the band once was. This is a joke and a lack of respect for the fans. They should, at least, change the name of the band to not mislead people to buy this ""new"" thing they are doing now. Don't waste your money buying this CD."
1,1 more thing to add.,"Don't ever order anything off of their website www.lowprofilerecords.com they will not send you what you order, I order some cd's from there 2 months ago and I got burned, and when I tried to contact them they never responded to any of my emails."
3,No Index,"It was free and I like Bunyan's writings.The first title is the ""Memoir of John Bunyan"" which I did not have.However - be warned. There is no index of any kind.The ""go to"" menu offers Beginning, End, and Location. That's it.So I don't know what else is included,yet."
2,IRIS I DIDN'T BUY IT!,THE MOVIE JUST DIDN'T HOLD MY ATTENTION. I FELL ASLEEP SO I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO FINISH IT BUT THEN AGAIN I DIDN'T WANT TO. THE SUBTITLES IF THAT 'S WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL THEM WERE TERRIBLE. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO NEED ENG. SUB. I DONATED THE MOVE TO A CHARITY.
4,great set,"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend who has a bachelor degree in fine arts, and he said it is great for sketching, very happy with it. His only critique was the set doesn't include a wide variety of leads - softer for shading/blending and harder for details. This set is a good medium."
1,Unfunctional,The hole placements was in the wrong place of the sink - did not work. Make sure if you order it you know the exact placement of the drain hole in your sink.
4,Beautiful Acoustics,"The first time I ever heard this album was when I walked into a Sharper Image store. They always play music that they sell, but this time I was totally amazed. The acoustic spanish music is some of the most beautiful ever, but the Festival of Four give you a tour around the globe of Latin countries playing in their style, you must hear this CD if you are into acoustic guitars!"
4,Very helpful!,"As a practicing psychiatrist with C-L responsibilities, this book has given me the right tool to deal with many clinical issues in the medical and surgical environment. Despite the exhaustive and elaborate details about common topics, each chapter is quick to digest. Indeed, it reads like a handbook but it has the details of a textbook. I highly recommend it especially that this well-written literature has helped me pass the certification in Psychosomatic Medicine (American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology)."
4,A good book,Well written and organized book. Some chapters are better than others and there is a definite bias towards the way Mass General does things. But still a good resource for any C/L Psychiatrist.
1,Not the best quality,"Liked the shed, looks nice, paid $349 at Home Depot. Assembly wasn't bad, just one problem. There are small button/knobs that hold the doors in place on top and bottom of the front doors. Approx 6 months after I put it together, the lower knob on the right side door snapped off. Now, the door falls off all the time. As it's plastic, it's not fixable. Piece of crap."
4,useful but a little clunky,"After converting our garage into living space we were left with the question of where to put the kid's bikes (two teenage boys - hence the need for living space). We already had one of these storage sheds and needed another. They go together fairly easily, but you really have to make sure that the ground below them is level otherwise the tilt will loosen some of the connections. All in all they look good and are work well. The delivery service had promised delivery on a certain day but didn't show until the next. A minor inconvenience."
1,"""Film"" of the Dead","I fell asleep during the first 20 minutes. My nap was the highlight during this abomination. Maybe I fell asleep hoping I'd have a nightmare; because the film surely didn't scare me. I've seen many low-budget horror flicks but this one cuts the cake (no offense to this specialty dessert). If you are a horror fan and even feel a moment compelled to watch this film, turn on your TV and watch the Weather Channel...you'll be much more entertained. No joke. I'm a horror buff. I was horrified that this film had a price tag. If someone gives it to you free-of-charge they are not your friend. It's like slipping Ex-Lax into baked brownies. Oh Sh--!. Enough. I'm the first to review this piece of junk...and hopefully the last to buy it. Trust me...re-runs of ""Leave It To Beaver"" are more entertaining."
1,As Promised 1982-88 A Trip Down Memory Lane,This Music is hard driving late 70's and early 80's punk rock sound. The tune automated insection reminds me of The Ramones and Sex Pistols style of this genre. It is not my personal favorite and I did not listen to the rest of the CD. The sound fidelity and music stink.
2,What is it with towels today? - did eventually wash up nicely,"I ordered these towels in the rose color and the blue color, and I admit they are large and beautiful. They just don't feel very absorbent. I have washed them several times now, the same way that I wash my other towels, and they still don't really dry you off as well as our old towels do. I have had this trouble with designer towels elsewhere, but I thought it also had to do with softened water, which we don't have here. I looked at the tags on our old towels, and all of the following are way more absorbent: Martex, Stevens, Feldcrest, St. Mary's and Cannon. Too bad !! Additional information: I am upgrading them from two stars to three. After several additional washings, they are beginning to feel like halfway decent towels. The brand is apparently a sub of Martex... Atelier [by] Martex. I guess nothing's what it used to be...(update a few months later, the towels are fine now. whew!)"
1,Cheap. Don't buy this!,"Towels are inferior quality. Pill, pull, and fuzz alot. I will NEVER buy a martex towel online again, now that I know they peddle such junkie towels with their name.Even complained to the manufacturer about them and was given the brush off."
1,They fall apart.,"I'm not a picky person. A few loose threads, or uneven seams I could live with. I cannot live with towels that just fall apart. A slight pull on any of the loops and they come right out into your hand. These will disintegrate in less than a month of normal use. I have never returned anything to Amazon before, these are all going back."
5,Arendt's Opus Magnum,"Origins, an incredibly detailed analysis of Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany, shows Arendt's versatility in political thought. I have yet to see a political philosopher/thinker publish a work with this much depth to it, and I think it will be a long time before we see anything like it.Many of the reviews here have done better justice to her legacy, so I will just say that if you are thinking twice about pursuing this work because of it's length, think three times."
1,A classic in rags.,"This rating is not for the book, but for the edition. The book is a classic, and if you want to understand the totalitarian regimes, it is a must-read.However, the edition is lousy, to say the least. In many pages the ink is so blurred that the text is almost illegible.Do yourself a favor: buy this book from another publisher."
5,The best book about totalitariasm,"There are several books about the theme of totalitarianism, but this is one is the best. Hannah Arendt trascends all traditional concepts of ""left"" and ""righ"". You could feel the malignancy of this political pathology and understand how it works."
2,norteamericano-centric,"The maps of the U.S. states and Canadian provinces are very good -- which makes one wonder even more why the entire country of Mexico is limited to a single page in this road atlas (and one that it shares with Puerto Rico, at that!). It's such a pathetic showing that Rand McNally really should take ""Mexico"" out of the title of this volume."
1,Not the right message to send,"This movie was strange yet funny. The language wasn't all that great and I feel that the conflict resolution wasn't expressed in a proper way. I realize that it is rated PG for mild bullying and some rude humor, but the rating says nothing about the vulgar language throughout the entire film. I don't want to say that the the movie intentionally tried to give off the message that, when bullied, just become a bully yourself. Unfortunately that's how it comes off. Not a movie we will be watching again in our home."
4,Good place to start . . .,"I am just getting into Oracle Applications. Traditionally, I always read the Oracle Documentation . . . (RTFM). I bought this book for the purpose of getting a high level view before getting into the Oracle Docs. This book is well laid and reads very easily. The author also points to various Metalink articles which is a nice touch."
2,A Waste Of Money,"This is a very dull book. None of it describes any of the synthesizers or technology used to produce techno. The book is little more than a list of techno founders. Don't expect any details about them. Each is given extremely minimal coverage.As a historical record the book does a good job of documenting something that might otherwise be lost in time. But if you want a book that is entertaining, this is certainly not it."
4,Appealing,"In this workout, there are endless series of optional progressions (he adds layers and layers of moves). You can stick to the basic pattern or add these complex add-ons. Either way, it's challenging. You get three complete dance routines that make you use all of the step. He teaches each move easily, and he is very upbeat and enthusiastic (which helps you become just the same). I love this dvd and the energy level is always high during the workout and as a result; after the workout too."
3,Good read.,"Not sure why the title is in French when the text is in English, but I feel this book covered a lot more of the movies than the first one did. However, clearly the movie left out quite a bit. Enjoyed the read, simple, easy, and quick. Good for busy weeks."
1,Sizing has changed - VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years. They're my favorite work shoe, and I have them in navy, black, white, and recently used leather paint to make a red pair! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing? Decided to send back for 2 size 11's -- too small. Will try for 11-1/2. Very disappointed that a product that's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change."
3,All-Star Authors deliver!,This book is a welcome addition to my collection of erotica. I was thoroughly impressed with the wide range of thought-provoking and sensual tales by my favorite renowned authors collaborating with unknown writers daring to make their debut explosively. I would give it a much higher rating if every story was as hot as the last.
4,Comprehensive,"This is a very complete dictionary, but if your eyes are like mine, you'll want to have a magnifying glass handy."
3,Careless error...,"The book was delivered in tact and is nice, especially as a gift for someone who enjoys completing crosswords. The package was delivered on time, however the packaging was torn, smashed, and open wide enough that it took little effort to remove the book itself from it. This product is great & made my grandfather very happy, so for that I'd give it 5 stars, however the packaging was about a 1 star, so averaging the two, its a 3 star review!"
2,ehh... nothing new,"I found the book to be very clinical and dry with the same information that can be found in every other pregnancy book. I thought this would have more personal stories and humor, but aside from the short email clips in the beginning of chapters, it was quite boring.If this is the first book you've picked up on getting pregnant then it will probably be helpful. If you've already read the basics and are looking for something different and humorous - this is NOT the book for you."
5,a true master of realism!!,"Balzac's wit and and talent is simply unsurpassable!!As Lucien is manipulated by the rich aristocrats to the point of self distraction in order to pursue his talents in poetry, we learn the price of fame and status and condemn the aristocratic society where can be a fine line between pleasure and pain. Balzac's theme-like mythology- on the confilcs of high and low society is never aging.."
5,Hmmm ..... Nvidia?,"In truth is a great technology, the performance is excellent, the capacity of graphic deployment is high, the graphic memory complies with all the requirements for the current applications, the cost is low in comparison of benefices."
4,Great book!,"Its a ""behind the scenes"" of rise of a young, talented artist. Its not too often you get to hear and see an artist's perspective of another artist.Merri was allowed to photograph Jeff when he was starting out in New York and became his exclusive photographer. The pictures are outtakes from the album artwork and live shots of Jeff in concert.If you are a true fan of Jeff Buckley, you have to have this book."
5,Beautiful,"If you have been as touched by Jeff Buckley's music as I have, then you absolutely need this book. The book's showcase, of course, is many gorgeous photographs of Jeff - studio portraits, live shots, casual-hanging-out shots, publicity photos, etc. It almost feels like this book contains every single photo of Jeff ever taken. (It doesn't, of course, but it feels that way - and it's a good feeling.)Mixed with the photos are quotes and stories about Jeff as told by his friends and loved ones. The touching words along with the haunting photos of Jeff will really give you a sense of who he was, almost as much as his music does.Buy this book. Drink a mug of warm chai tea, and read it while listening to Grace (preferably on a cold, rainy autumn day.) Once the album is over, your mug is empty and you've reached the last page of this stunning book, you will be changed, in a way that is both bittersweet and right."
3,Probably a very good book,"I ordered this book based on an interview with the author that I heard on NPR. Overall it seemed like a very complete book, but it was far to technical and scientific for me to appreciate it. I gave it 3 stars not because it's not a good book - but it's too advanced for me to give it an accurate review. If you are looking for an easy non technical nutrition book - this isn't it. If you are looking for something a bit meatier, with plenty of scientific technical information - it may be the one you want."
5,A veritable gold mine of information,"This is an exceptional product! While I do not recommend it to everyone, I do recommend it to every serious athlete and any that are interested in nutrition. I originally purchased this book in High School in order to better understand how to fuel my body for sports competitions, it provided me with sound guidance which helped me to avoid unsafe dietary practices. I have since carefully reread it, thereby gaining a solid foundation of moderate, objective, nutritional knowledge that is allowing me to breeze through my Bachelor level nutrition classes.Be warned this is a textbook so don't expect it to read like a magazine, reading the title will tell you that the material might be too ADVANCED for some. That said, this is as close to a complete reference of relevant, unbiased, sports nutrition knowledge I have ever seen, it should be the foundation of every sports nutrition library."
2,Very scientific,Too scientific for me. This book may be a good reference if you're a sports dietitian.
1,Horrible,The finish came off of this pan after I cooked in it once. The fact that it was only cooked in on medium heat just goes to show what junk this is. DO NOT purchase this!
1,reeealyyy cool game,"i absolutely loved this game ! this is the best game i have ever played, better than all the playstation,nintendo,and dreamcast games COMBINED !Your this little girl and her dad gets caught in a nasty storm.You live on an island and youur pet is a baby monkey.you try to find your dad but you never do.the plot is so exellent and original.also,the dad is so nice to you and your baby monkey.Oh,the log flume roaller coaster is SSSSOOOOOO COOOL! BUY THIS GAME IT ROCKS THE HOUSE TOTALLY.oH,i FoRgoT to mention about your boyfriend and his sword. There is a secret level in wich you go into this cave and go fishing and you catch this boy and you get married and the boy wants to meet your dad but never does"
1,Did not work as well as described.,"I bought theTechPower iPod AC Charger for iPod Nano, G5 Video, G4, G3 and Mini.because of the price and positive reviews. My basically did not work as described. I have plugged it in a number of times and the indicator light has only come in once or twice. I have jiggled the connections and switched sockets but it does not work. Instead of sending it back, I just bought theApple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger/ Travel Adapter/ Cable - Whiteand it works fine."
3,Could Be Better,"When Destinys Child dropped the first two singles off this album I was in anticipation of the entire album. ""Independant Women"" and ""Survior"" are very strong influential songs for young women out there not to mention the catchy melodies and lyrics. I received this album on Saturday last and made it my priority to listen thinking the entire album would be as excellent or even better than their previous ""The Writings On The Wall"". To my suprise this is the weakest I've ever heard from them. Besides the two previously mentioned songs, there were a few others that I could relate to but overall I found this album not to be the best work they could have produced. Girls you gotta try again!This is in no way stemmed from the negative press they have been receving. Purchase this Album and review it for yourself."
4,Is there 1 girl in the group or three girls???????,"Ok here's what I have to say about Destiny's Child:They are 3 talented girls but Beyonce takes all the credit and act like she has a solo carrer and not a group carrer.On this album Beyonce leads all the way and you can hear on sevreal of the songs kelly and michelle.Also on concerts and tv performences Beyonce is always the one on the front of the stage and kelly and michelle is on the back like backup singers,so Beyonce stop ruling you've talent but share!!!!!Now about the album:This album is good.You won't find standout songs like ""say my name,""bills bills bills"" but there are also good songs in this album like the story of beauty,perfect man,nasty girls and survivor."
2,Survivor Is WACK,"This album is a disappointment. I know after all the drama they were trying really hard to change their sound and make better lyrics, but they were better off sticking to the old formula. Change is often good but not in this case. Besides the fact that only about 5 of the songs are worth listening to they added useless, stupid, annoying interludes after some songs (i.e. Survivor). Maybe the 13 and younger crowd would enjoy these juvenile, senseless lyrics and silly interludes. ""The Writings on the Wall"" is a classic and that is their best work ever, even they can't top it."
2,I'm dissapointed,"In 2000 LaTavia Robernson and Letoya Luckett left Destiny's Child because of managment problems. Later in 2001 Destiny's Child recorded Survivor, and I believe this song is boo-hooing Letoya and LaTavia. Notice the lyrics:Now that you're out of my lifeI'm so much betterYou thought that I'd be weak without youBut I'm strongerYou thought that I'd be broke without youBut I'm richerYou thought that I'd be sad without youI laugh harderYou thought I wouldn't grow without youNow I'm wiserThough that I'd be helpless without youBut I'm smarterYou thought that I'd be stressed without youBut I'm chillin'You thought I wouldn't sell without youSold 9 millionThat's all."
2,Three singles and filler,"This album is okay. There are only 3 really good songs: ""Independent Woman Pt.1""(Pt.2 is just awful), ""Survivor"", and ""Bootylicious"". The rest is poorly written and full of really bad production. It just doesn't sound good. If you want a DC album get ""The Writings On The Wall"" that is good from start to finish. This is 3 singles and filler. Don't waste your time."
4,DC,I HATE THAT VIOLIN SOUND IN SURVIVOR I DON'T LIKE THE SONG LIKE THAT BUT BOOTYLISCIOUS MADE ME BUY THE CD NA THAT SONG IS BANGIN AND THE CD AIN'T THAT BAD BUT IT HAS NOTHIN ON TWIOTW AND YA'LL KNOW IT. DESTINYS CHILD WORKED HARD FOR THERE SUCCESS AND THIS SHOWS HARD WORK PAYS OFF!!!
2,Not What I Expected from Destiny's Child,"When I first got this CD, I was anxious to listen to it since I was a big fan of Destiny's Child's last album, The Writings On the Wall. Well, it was a disaster!All of the songs are mostly with the same dull standard r'n'b beat and aren't original like, ""Bills Bills Bills"" or ""Say My Name"" were. Not to mention that Beyonce took over the record, barely giving Kelly and Michelle a chance to peak through.Their remake of ""Emotions"" was probably the best track on this Cd, along with the ""Gospel Medley"".With Destiny's new line-up, I expected this Cd to be even better than their last and to be a creative exploration.I guess I was wrong, because this Cd is mostly just a collection of tasteless songs."
3,Okay...,"Okay they can sing, that is a given but come on I'm a Survivor that was an awesome song but I can't help but think they are singing it to the two original members that were kicked out. They seem to have lost all dignity for themselves and seem to throw it in the others' faces that they are 'surviving'. Give me a break. Yeah they were doing great singing the songs they original four started off singing but on their earlier cds you can tell they definetly changed their sound, maybe for the better if that's how you see it but I think they lost some of the heart and soul that was in their music and now it seems as though its all about the money and image. But hey someone always buys into it. The music is good but as I said before, it lost it's heart, it's meaning."
1,This Cd Is Terrible!!!!,"I bought this cd trying to give DC another chance since they booted out my favorite two girls Letoya and Latavia out of the group. What was I thinking? Someone, please yell at me for wasting my money on this weak cd. How could they make that song Survivor thinking that us fans will not think that they are dissing ex members? They are so wrong, and I should have let these girls go when they kicked out the other two. The only songs that I like on this album are: Independent Woman, not the circus version and Emotion. This cd is straight trash, and to me it does not fit in any category of music that will go down in history. I am tired of their style of music. I love R&B groups who keep it real, like the group 112. Their music is worth listening to. And unlike Beyonce', when 112 produces music it is good quality, not trash like this. I hope that Beyonce's Child learns that friendship is something that should be valued, not thrown away over money."
1,Terrible 3rd CD for Destiny's Child,"I liked their other 2 CDS, but this one is so horrible that I resold it to a used music store after the first time I listened to it. The lyrics are very annoying and some of the songs are downright trashy. I was not impressed."
3,WHAT CAN I SAY REALLY!!!!!!!,"I brought the CD this past weekend and I found it hard to listen too. Don't get me wrong I like Destiny's Child, besides for the first four songs on the album the rest sounded like a child had written them. The beats just didn't sound like Destiny's Childs, didn't sound like that's something they would sing too. The Writings on the Wall album was great but this one I can't give full props too!"
3,Some have failed to realize...,"Some have failed to see the true essence of this CD. After looking beyond all of the assumed problems the girls may (or may not) have, people aren't really open to hearing any music. Many are so caught up in the troubles of the group that they failed to obtain and retain the true essence of this CD. There were moments, as I was listening to the CD, that I noticed that the flow or rythm of the CD was often tossed back and forth. I will agree that the CD could have been better laid out and planned, but the content overall was pretty good. I personally have not yet purchased the CD, but I plan to do so to support these girls in there efforts to become stars."
3,"New Lineup, Old sound","Well It seems like ages since ''Writing....'' came out and now we are faced with ''Survivor'', not really following a formula like their predecessors but maybe they should have, unlike ''Writing'' where every song was a potential single, Survivor starts off good but then goes into fillers. Also, ''Writing'' had a theme, something to folow, whereas Survivor flips around like a fish gasping for air, not sure which direction to go. Writing... was an easy album to listen to ALL the way through which is rare but Survivor will make you frantically reaching the Repeat button before you hit the later songs. Survivor has a few gems but lacks a focus."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I bought this album anticipating music which would excel that of 'The writings on the wall' which i found to be an excellent album which i could listen to time and time again, I think that will have to stay in my CD player because this album just drags on and it seems Destinys Child have lost thier own style somewhere, the music sytle has become confused and just doesnt some near to that of thier previous work, the songs they have released as singles were good, i dont know what they will do for future releases of sales, non compare to thier usual standard. The track 'Brown Eyes' reminds me of a Mariah Carey style song, Beyonce even sounds like her. This albun was a big Disappointment for me."
4,Ben Lover,I love this Cd. The tracks Independent Woman Part I and II are excellent. So is Survivor and Bootylicious. Nasty girl is ok and most of the other tracks are pretty good. I would reccomend buying this cd.
3,Just like their old cds....,"I shouldn't expect much from Destiny's Child. This cd reminds me of their old cds. So if you liked their old cds, then you'll prob like this one. This CD is nothing new, nothing special. I was expecting something better. The ""Survivor"" song was so great I thought the CD wouldn't be that bad. The Cd has a few good songs... when I say ""a few"" i mean 2 (one of the good songs is remake of an old song (i think)). The slow songs aren't bad, but the fast ones are horibble. I think if you can find it used it might be worth it so you can add to your collection but other then that I don't think this cd was worth my ...(money)."
3,I expected more!!!!!!!!!,"I got this album anticipating great things, considering their second cd (Writings on the Wall) is one of my favorite cd's. But sadly, they were lacking in originality and creativity. In all honesty, this album sounds like little girls singing about being in love or hating on some other female. I did like a couple of songs on the album such as Dangerously in Love, Fancy, and Gospel Medley. Other than that, I was disappointed. Beyonce' is an excellent singer and writer, but I expected more."
3,Beyonce are you generous enough to share the lead vocals?,"Well, after listening to the CD I only really like four songs, Independent Woman, Survisor, Emotions and Brown Eyes.Browns Eyes will definitely be a hit!! They blew me away with Emotions. The harmony is just amazing;however, I would have enjoyed it more if Beyonce had been willing to share lead vocals with the others. Kelly sang one, lucky her and she did very well! I didn't hear the new girl at all except for back up and she is an excellent songstress. I believe Beyonce will very soon go solo because it's her world! ADVISE: (Destiny's Child) stay together long enough to record your fourth CD let the other members of the group get a chance to sing LEAD also. Overall, I'm a little let down as it (CD) did not live up to my expectations, since Independent Woman and Survivor were so good."
2,"Not really my kind of music,",I bought this for the Bootylicious song because of the Stevie Nicks guitar riff from Edge of 17. Stevie still rules.
1,"Not a very good album, and Beyonce is still conceited","I'm not a big fan of Destiny's Child, especially since the other two girls left the group. I'm not fond of Beyonce either I just like her name. Beyonce is too conceited for me. She reminds me so much of Diana Ross, you would think that she's related somehow. She takes over all of the songs, you hardly ever hear Kelly or Michele and I think they have beautiful voices whenever Beyonce will let them sing. I don't own the new album but I did hear sample songs from it, and I don't like them at all, except for ""Survivor"" and ""Bootilicious"". Until Beyonce comes down from her high horse, and let the other girls sing a few songs or more I'll continue not to like them."
4,Survivor,"Fun upbeat album. Some of the songs make you wonder who they were written about like ""Nasty Girl""."
5,Great Album,"Destiny's Child have really improved themselves over the year after their debut album that didn't really succeed came their 2nd album ""writing's on the wall"" who's a smashing sucess and now came their 3rd album who's also great in ""survivor you can find many upbeat songs one of my faves there are:bootylicious,nasty girl and happy face and there are also slow songds there my faves are""dangerously in love who's an excellent ballad beyonce really did a great job on writing this amazing ballad.My cd contains another 2 songs who aren't on the us version:Dance with me and my heart beats This cd is really reccomnded GO DESTINY'S CHILD"
3,"A few highlights, but bland overall","Ignore, for a minute, the fact that Destiny's Child have been pegged (and marketed) as an R&B group. SURVIVOR is straight-up pop, and all the drippy soul ballads the trio choose to record won't change the fact that Destiny's Child are at their best when they're making you dance. From the anthemic (if overplayed) title track, to the slinky groove of ""Apple Pie a la Mode"", to the flawless ""Bootylicious"" (one of the best singles of 2001), SURVIVOR pops with energy and enthusiasm...until the tempo drops. Then it's schmaltz city, redeemed only by an atypically (for the group) understated cover of Samantha Sang's ""Emotion"". The ballads are packed with feeling, but no tangible melody or flow - it's all goop, all the time. Pick up SURVIVOR for the hooky pop hits, but discard the rest."
5,Love it,"I was not a Destiny's Child fan before this cd, but I think the cd is wonderful. I love Survivor, Independent Women Part 2, and Dangerously in Love. There is a moral behind most, if not all of the songs. It is full of Destiny's Child's signature fast, hip-hoppish, poetic lyrics. The musical quality is fitting for the songs. Though Beyonce' Knowles is the main feature on the album, listeners will here solos from Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well. This cd is very meaningful and is just superb."
5,a one book resource guide to construction,I recommend this book to anyone looking for quick building or construction reference. Excellent for Design students.
2,very poor,"very poor written. you finish with a sensation of void. don't aggregate nothing. the book is like an enumeration of anecdotes and things that ""sync"", but there are no theory nor tesis nor explanation of almost nothing, mere speculation. Thus, just for speculations, i prefer poetry. cheers!"
1,ugh,"If you thought that the Psyduck or Jigglypuff beanies were bad, wait til you see THIS! It KINDA looks like Mewtwo, but eventhough theres no picture, theres is piece of purple cloth around it's neck for some reason, and it looks like it's wearing a bib for some reason. Also, it may just be the one I have, but it may have a tough time standing up, if it can at all. Do your self a favor, pass over this one unless you're a completest and just go for the Gengar beanie."
5,BUY all of his books!,"Just recently discovered this author even though the books are older. I am now collecting them all. I am really enjoying these stories. If you like animals and humorous stories these are wonderful, calming books."
1,Just a critic analysis,"Bored. Stupid. Just a speculative analysis of the film, the opinion of one guy obliged to write about the movie. No interesting info at all."
1,Lost money on this one,I bought this BenQ product and have used it for only few months. It was working good and all of a sudden it started not recognising the discs. I found this is a very unreliable product and there is not too much of help also is offered.It is always a pain to go behind the warranty or return these. I gave up on small companies like this and bought an NEC one. It is not worth the save of money.
4,R&B from the early 70's It was bonifide!,"Johnny guitar watson was king when I was back in school with some real great licks and a soulfull strut to knock you out! This brothers got it all and as he says, ""Abdule Juibar couldn't make this prices ,,with a SKYHOOK!!!"""
1,Don't feel this cheaply made item is safe for my child.,"I have a similar baby yard, but it is very solid without any spaces a toddler can get into trouble with. This item is not very sturdy and I feel the spaces could allow a toddler to get into trouble. BUYER BEWARE--YOU HAVE TO PAY THE RETURN SHIPMENT."
4,Just What We Need,"The item works perfectly for what we need it for. This item allows our 1 year old to have room to play while being contained at the same time. Plus, the carry handle makes it convenient to bring anywhere."
5,Great Product!,This is a great handy helper to have when you have a little one on the go. My daughter is 14 months and isn't always fond with going into the play yard but it really helps when I need to fix dinner or something and can't follow her around the house to pull things out of her mouth and get her out of things. She can push it around a little but doesn't get too far on the carpet or on the concrete driveway or grass.With plenty of toys and a some snacks she is most of the time content in with playing in the play yard while mommy gets a few things done.So all in all we are very happy with this product!
3,works for what it in intended for,"Item works ok. The pros it's light weight. Keeps the baby containted. The cons who ever enginered the door and the hinges needs to go back to college. I thought the door would be in the middle of one of the sections. Its just a hinge you pull up to open one of the sections. The hinges screw tight on one end but, on the other side just the teeth hold it together no pressure so it can slip.My 7 month old is staring to stand and when she pulls her self up it wiggles all over the place. I had to put bricks on the outside to keep it from moving so much. I'm not sure I would get it again the price is what got me to buy. The metal ones are twice as much. I'm sure there alot more hevy duty but, I dout you can take them along with you. If you need something cheap get this but, If you have the money go with a metal one or a beter one."
3,"Ok, but not more than that.","The pros:CheapLightweightEase to transportTallThe cons:So light that a larger kid can push it aroundNot the most attractive thing aroundNot the strongest constructionConclusion:Does the job at a cheap price, but not too strong and attractive. Personally I would probably go for a different model next time."
1,consider your flooring!,"this looked good - sturdy and strong, inside or outside use, gate - but i gave no thought to the smooth wooden floors in our house. WHAT A LAUGH. once inside it, our 11 mth son pushes it around the house like a baby walker. does not retain its shape, sections wobble as he cruises around....lots of entertainment, but not secure. i'm getting a steel one - BabyDan do a few different models inc one with a pad."
2,"A hinge, please.","If you are strong, and don't mind using muscle when trying to pry open one of the panels of this thing, the safe play yard does its job. However, like too many safety products that are made without much thought to who will actually be using them (i.e., mothers who are often sleep deprived...bless their souls), this product has a seriuos design flaw: it has no lock/unlock mechanism. What you need is brute strenght to pry the panel up and out, and when the baby is safely in the yard, you need to, again, lift and pry it back into place. Not the most user friendly design I've seen. Summer Infant has another product that does have a door, which we subsequently purchased."
5,All the musics of the cd are wonderful,"I enjoy most of Hodoo Gurus's musics, but this cd has something special: all the musics are incredible....you want to listen to it from the first one till the last, never missing one. It doesn't happen to the majority of the cds"
5,Phil Coulter,"Very nice, relaxing music. ""The Shores of the Swilly"" is a remarkable song, done very well by Sinead O'Connor. The entire CD is top quality. If you enjoy soft, Irish piano music, this is the one."
3,Nice,Delightful album in a small way. A good companion to her Music of the Italian Renaissance (which I thought had a litle more oomph).
3,A good (an not so expensive) reference to the period,"This small book (just 72 pages) consists basically of a collection of (good) pictures, with its respective legends, most of them unpublished until now (at least in the books I got). The stile is similar to ""Aircraft of The Luftwaffe Fighter Aces"", from Bernd Barbas's. Noteworthy is the initial section, with 11 (eleven) WWII original color pictures, most from the famous Jeff Ethell's private collection. A small introduction summarizes the facts from the birth of Luftwaffe to the end of 1942 (the remaining story is told in the volume 6, "" Defeat in the West, 1943-1945, from Mike Spick). The pictures, most in close-ups, are an excellent reference for modelers. As this book is part of a collection, which covers the Luftwaffe action over all fronts, I recommend the purchase of all of them."
2,Useless illustrations in Kindle,"There's some good information in this title, but the illustrations (images actually, of data from the Daily Racing Form) in the Kindle edition are too blurry to read.There are many examples in the book that use the DRF samples to help you make sure you're applying the book's featured techniques properly, but the samples scanned for Kindle are useless for this purpose.I had to acquire a hardcover copy for about $50 used. I do NOT recommend purchasing the Kindle edition."
5,Adios Amazon,"I purchased this book (among others) from you. I read the book and it provokes a great deal of thought and doubt about JFKerry. I think it is a great read for anyone who will be voting in November.However, I find it quite suspect that Amazon has chosen this particular book for a change in its review policy. You seem to have overstepped the bounds of being a retailer to now also being politically motivated.I have lost my faith in dealing with Amazon. There are many other outlets to purchase books, etc., without any underlying slants.Please remove me from your database."
1,Another Pack of Lies Courtesy of the Republican Smear Team,"I really don't need to spend a lot of time exposing this lurid collection of half-truths and outright lies as recent articles in the New York Times and Washington Post have already revealed the current administrations fingerprints all over this smear of a gallant and courageous sailor. (...) As a Navy veteran, I am appalled and disgusted (...)"
1,Written & subsequently discredited.. Need I say more?,"This book, written by John O'Neill (who is accused of postings on anti-Semitic message forums), has its claims summarily discredited by the Navy & all record-keeping US governmental agencies. If you're a republican, buy this book & then try to convince yourself that George Bush is a stand-up, straight-shooting leader.. when you're 80, and when you see what he did to our country, I hope you regret your vote. If you want some convincing, check out E.L. Doctorow's piece at the link below.http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0920-13.htm"
1,Hate spelled everywhere!,This is a hate book by some desperate millionaires who think they can control American voters. We are going to show them at the polls in November. Kerry will win the election because he is not a lyer and cheater. Save your money citizens who love America. I gave 1 star for the rating because there is not a lower number.Otherwise I would have given a -00000.
1,Love bad fiction? This book is for you!,"Written by a bunch of Bush-backed partisan hacks, this book purports to be the story of men who served ""with"" Mr. Kerry in Vietnam. Of course, their being in Vietnam ""with"" John Kerry is the same as my being ""with"" Sigfried & Roy since I was ""with"" them in Las Vegas, i.e., I lived there, too.Badly written, with idiotic allegations, but should appeal to the Republican kindergarten set."
1,Debunked,"On Friday, August 20 the New York Times debunked many of the major arguments made in this book and by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group as well as exposed the many connections between SBVFT, the Bush family, and Karl Rove. Until recently, several of the SBVFT members told different stories of John Kerry's record and character. In many cases, material in Unfit for Command offered as proof is undercut by official Navy records and SBVFT members' own statements. Some SBVFT members now calling Kerry ""unfit"" praised his service as recently as last year."
1,Unfit for Command: Haunted Souls Speak Out Against George W.,"Unfit for Command? Sure, that would be George W. Bush! Since he has become president of the United States we have lost the towers, respect, jobs and most importantly LIVES! If killing off more American's is our goal than by all means let's have Bush for four more years. Hey, why not write a book titled ""Unfit for Command: Haunted Souls Speak Out Against George W. Bush""!"
1,"Lies, Lies, and more Lies","As a proud veteran (but way too young to have been in Vietnam, although my father and a number of uncles proudly served), I will tell you that this book is a pack of lies. If you don't believe me, check out factcheck.org and spinsanity.org. both are non-partisan websites that point out the lies/misrepresentations of both political parties and campaigns. ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"", a group started by a Nixon ally and funded by Republican fundraisers, is the group behind this pack of lies."
1,Suitable for birdcage liner.,"In the light of the contradictions in the SBVT members own statements, the ties to Bush-Cheney-Rove, the lack of eyewitness accounts, the obvious distortion, the contradiction of their claims from existing Navy records and the fact that a fellow Navy commander who was alongside Kerry during the events in question has broken a 35 year silence to denounce the lies of these partisan mudslingers, you can save yourself the bother of reading this unsupported and scurrilous character assasination of a true war hero.Absolute rubbish!"
1,The charges would be damning if only they were true,"But as we've seen, O'Neill & Corsi's account is rapidly falling apart. In recent days we've seen evidence that O'Neill does have strong ties to the Bush family and there is even some question as to whether or not O'Neill even witnessed any of Kerry's actions in Vietnam. Corsi himself is also a rather non-credible source most notorious for his anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic statements posted on a conservative website the Free Republic. At this point there are too many veterans who are debunking the claims that the authors are making, and the authors themselves are far from credible. While it's true that every once in a while non-credible authors can speak the truth, it's usually a safe bet that they won't. If you're looking for truth, don't waste your money on this book."
1,"Oh my, this IS funny....five star reviewer STILL won't answer the questions!",Two more nonresponses.Total to date:Nine.
1,"Anybody see Five Star Reviewer actually answer a question? Nope, me either.","It should be so easy to provide facts to back up claims. Plenty of other reviewers seem to be able to do it. Even though the single five star reviewer has been asked to back up his or her claims for weeks now, he just can't seem to do it.In fact, he's made five more posts without a single factual answer.Total to date:Twenty five."
1,Kerry Fought - Bush did Not - end of story,The guys that wrote this book are a joke. ZERO Credibility.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13267-2004Aug18.htmlRead it and weep.
4,Thank you Fox News,"Since you normally ""prohibit ad hominem"" attacks but have suspended same for _Unfit for Command_, you may ""have fun"" in the future. I ""take no responsibility"" for your being without my account."
1,Paid Political Garbage,"When I picked this book up, I expected it to be at least well researched. It's mostly opinion, by a guy who has an axe to grind who, incidentally, never even served with Kerry himself, just followed him around and debated him on some talk shows.I think it's really funny how the Bush cronies keep wanting to revisit Kerry's war record and attack his medals when their guy didn't even fight in the war. By that measure, who is really unfit to command here?"
1,Seriously?!!??!!?,"Is it not clear by now that books like this are meant to inflame and manipulate? From BOTH sides, left and right. LISTEN to the candidates on what they are REALLY going to do, what they have done and they say to YOU as a person. Don't buy this garbage for a second. Do you like what George has done in Iraq? Fine. Vote for George. But REALLY get the facts. Do you like what John Kerry plans for the economy? Fine. Vote for John. But REALLY get the info on what he is going to do. It may take a little digging, but that is your job as an informed voter. Don't allow yourself to be spoon fed DISTORTIONS of the facts, and books like this are CLEARLY distortions, and do a grave disservice to the voting process in America."
4,Balance for Brinkley/Kerry Tour of Duty,The Swift boat vets' book is well documented and provides many insights into others views of the combat situation in which they & John Kerry participated. This is a good companion read along with Brinkley's book lifted from Kerry notebooks. The analysis of Senate hearing information is new and disturbing. RTH
4,Truth Will Get You All The Time,A must read ( and it was for many Americans). The truth about someone who was a hero in his own mind. A recount of what this ''officer'' did during his 4 months in Viet Nam and his use and abuse of policy for his own self interests not his fellow sailors.
1,The actual truth,"To understand the lies in this book and where they came from, go see, for starters:http://factcheck.org/article.aspx?docID=231http://slate.msn.com/id/2105353http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13267-2004Aug18.htmlhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/20/politics/campaign/20swift.html?ex=1250654400&en;=8afa4fded4046b86&ei;=5090&partner;=rssuserlandhttp://mediamatters.org/items/200408200003http://mediamatters.org/search.html?string=Unfit+for+Commandhttp://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/front_page/109300303292321.xml"
4,Kerry has yet to refute these charges by the Swift Boat Vets,"John Fraud Kerry has had 11 months to clear the air on these charges. He hasn't. John Fraud Kerry has had 34 years to apologize to real Americans. He hasn't. And John Kerry has had over 34 years to apologize to all the oprhans and widows. He hasn't.And Kitty Kelley has had over ten years to apologize to the Reagan family. She hasn't. Only an idiot would believe her. But then again, only an idiot would vote for Kerry too. Sort of runs together."
4,Vets put themselves at risk again,"Amazon: how about the timing of Richard Clarke's book, his hit-job on Bush? Missed that one, huh? No exception there. And what is the point of allowing ad hominem attacks? They add no information to a discussion; must be some Anybody But Bush folks in control at Amazon. Too bad. And who reads past the first few pages of these comments, anyway?The SBVT did the research and have the guts to go public in the book and on TV with their attacks on Kerry -- and these show their names and faces. Does the Left show its faces in the MoveOn.org ads? No way. I'll at least consider what the SBVT say."
1,Blatant Lies,"I am frankly shocked that so many people out there are supporting the accuracy of this book after it has been widely denounced by leaders of both political parties and its contents conflict with prior public statements of the authors and contemporanious military records. Those interested in the truth, rather than gratification of their own political biases, should read any one of the many news reports documenting the inaccuracies and blatant lies contained in this book."
1,"Get lost, conservative filth","Leave already, foul conservative scumbags. As usual, you whine like crybabies at free expression, so pick up your ball and go home. Get the hell off Amazon and never return, worthless slime. This site will be much better without the infestation of your Republican stench.Beat it, you worthless filth."
1,Wish I could rate this zero stars...,"I haven't read this book, and I doubt that I will. I simply would like to suggest that thinking people take a look at the website of the publisher of this book, http://www.regnery.com/. If you like right-wing, conservative reading, I bet you'll love this book. If you like balanced, factual views, you might want to read a mainstream press."
1,It doesn't matter,- It doesn't matter if he served only 4 months- It doesn't matter if he cheated on his medalsVietnam Veterans Against the War indirectly defended the communism in Vietnam and therefore around the world.Let's vote for Fidel Castro:- He has 45 years experience- He never changed his political views- He also enjoys the support of Hollywood
1,Let me get this straight...,"So the guy who John Kerry made a fool of during a nationally televised debate 30 years ago has written a book ripping Kerry about his service and published it during Kerry's presidential election campaign? Three things come to mind:1. Of course he wrote a book. But once a fool, always a fool. Very convenient timing, and isn't this type of campaigning illegal? Bush breaking rules or just changing them to his liking? TOTALLY SHOCKING.2. That's a long grudge to hold. How sad that he's lived his life that way.3. Kerry for President. At least he served."
4,Did reviewers even read the book???,"I highly doubt any of the reviewers that gave 1 star even read this book. Even if you are a big fan of John Kerry, it makes you at least have to consider that some of his statements aren't true. I haven't made up my mind yet for election day, but the ""it's okay for me"" approach from the Kerry camp with the Michael Moore attacks (some of his ""evidence"" has been shown to be staged and loosely connected) while freaking out when the other side fights back is just sad.If this was a reverse ticket (Edwards for pres) I would likely vote for him. However, after reading this book, I just have too many doubts about Kerry. Does he even acknowledge that he spent all those years in the senate???? Left or right, please at least read the book before writing a fake review."
1,Authors have been widely discredited,"The authors of this book are a bunch of liers and Monday morning quarterbacks. None of them actually served with Kerry on the swiftboats or has personal knowledge of any of the events. It is a pitty to see the Republican Party supporting this kind of irresponsible, baseless character assassination. President Bush should renounce the claims made in this book, and in the advertisement sponsored by same group. Afterall... where was President Bush when these events took place? Cowering in Texas, avoiding his national guard duties."
1,Please don't spend your money on this,"This book, and all others of its genre, turn my stomach. I can't believe that the American public is spending more and more money and brain space on this type of worthless hatred. I doubt that you would have changed your mind on whether or not to vote for Kerry based on this book, just like a Bush supporter won't be singing the praises Kerry after spending the fifteen bucks on a Michael Moore attack. This book is just a continuation of the caracatures of both candidates as bumbling, evil, insincere losers. Both sides work the spin machine to avoid having to deal with the details of the real issues. Spend your money donating to a local worthy cause instead of contributing to the author's wealth and fuelling more of this junk designed to bring a rather serious electoral process to Jerry Springer levels."
4,Even if only half True,"I read the book, I am of the Vietnam war era and this stirs up many bad memories. Jane Fonda has a soul mate. If you believe only 50%, This is what Over 50 year old people were subject to. I lost two good friends in the war and to have them ""guilty of war crimes"". The only person guilty is Mr. Kerry for his speech to congress while still in the Navy."
1,Not even fit to line the cat box,"I saw John O'Neil get skewered on ""Hardball"" with Chris Matthews. Who do these idiots think they're talking about? Everything they say is absolutely refuted by official records?It's nothing more than a cheap smear campaign, because O'Neil is angry about Kerry being a whistleblower, and revealing the nasty crimes that were committed by some of our troops. (And yes, they happened. No, that doesn't mean the entire military was at fault.)(BTW, I hear that Ollie North is going after Kerry's record in Vietnam. Now THAT'S a good one!)"
1,TYPICAL GOP KERRY BASHING TRIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"GWB is the absolute WORST president EVER! Now John Kerry A REAL AMERICAN is running to unseat this buffoon and of course since Bush has no positive points on his side he must resort to the ""tried and true"" GOP policy, ""Bash your opponent""I rate this as 1 star cause that is the lowest I can go.In reality I rate this claptrap a minus infinity."
1,Message to Ralph Nader,"Nader, you are a real loser, but you do have a point.My opponent may be more competant than I but at least I can say ""internets"".For the record I... uhhh... I.......... ummmmmmmmm. Oh nevermind!America needs a strong leader now that I've screwed everything up. I mean, who's gonna clean up the mess I made? My opponent seems qualified enough for the task.Hey, this ""internets"" thing is alot of fun! Wait till I tell the wife and kids about this one.Closing thoughts: If you are a loser, then go ahead and give me your votes, if not then vote for my opponent.I am George W. Bush and I approve of this message."
1,An honest question for George W Bush,"Hey George Bush:Man, how in the world do you manage to deep-throat all that oily Saudi meat when you can barely eat a pretzel without choking? Do you wear your cute little cheerleader outfit and pom-poms when you're on your knees in front of King Abdullah?"
1,What a piece of garbage!,"I'm getting fairly tired of the partisan garbage pilfered by both Democrats and Republicans. The trick they use is to package lies surrounded by a few truths. Moore did it with 911 as well. The fact remains that the people who actually served along side Kerry liked him. This book is just a collection of people angered by Kerry's anti-war stance after returning from Vietnam and a few partisan hacks. As long as you believe this tripe, America is in trouble. In my opinion, Kerry has the best record and sticks to the important issues. Bush has resorted to bashing, which should tell you something about his character. He really has nothing to say. I'm and independent, and I will be voting for a Dem this time around. Reps don't have anyone honest on their ticket. Not one."
1,Anyone for Checkers?,"Mud sticks, but that doesn't mean the good guys always lose. This is an ill thought-out, callous pile of checkbook journalism, that might great bedding for your hamster's cage.This 'book' is the would-be grassy knoll of the current electoral debate, slimy and demeaning. But this is one case where 'know your enemy' needs strict limits. If Bush is the Nixon for the new millennium, and JFKerry is the only man who can stop him, well let's face it . . .it will certainly take more than this rag-bag collection of innuendo and half-truth, to swing the race."
3,"""Ad Hominem Attack?""","Amazon is ""allowing"" ad-hominem attacks on this ONE and ONLY book!?! What is an ad-hominem attack?!? An Ad hominem attack on one's opponent is a tried-and-true strategy for people who have a case that is WEAK. Amazon, if this is they way you feel that the Lib's have to get their opinion in on this book - then go right ahead... I, however, will be taking my future business elsewhere. Thank God for the freedom in the United States of America"
1,A great work of fiction,"The creativity and imagination of the ""Swift Boat Veterans"" are unparalleled in the genre of contemporary political drama. In the style of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" these veterans create a masterful story that poses as ""reality."" In John Kerry, a character loosely based on the Massachusetts senator who is running for president, the swift boat veterans create a would-be hero, surrounded by servicemen and commanders recommending him for medals, and praising his actions in combat. However, it turns out that all of his accolades were awarded in a blundering display of incompetence, the likes of which would not be seen again until Bush's proclamation of ""Mission Accomplished."" Indeed, the Swift Boat Veteran's novel paints a scathing indictment of the US military, and how their errors could inadvertently bolster the political career of a man from Massachusetts who chose to serve his country."
1,Political and Dishonest....Book is a Scam,this book is an excellent commentary about politics and I feel (...) is another great place to continue the conversation and political chatter that this book will provoke.
1,Turned out to be lies,"A report has been released about 4 months ago that confirms that all of the swift boat guys lied, they openly support and applauded John Kerry's Heroic actions in vietnam, it was not only untill the 2004 elections did they start spewing their lies."
5,Great piece of political slander!,"In all my years I've never seen a more effective piece of slander. I will be very interesting in about six months when the final report comes out on these guys, and who funded them and where they were in relation to John Kerry during the Vietnam war. Seems like a lot of them didn't know him, and have admitted that what they have said was based on other's opinions. It's fair game, and I believe any reference to senator Kerry's silver star, bronze star, three purple hearts and two tours of duty in Vietnam will ultimately help him, even though Karl Rove promised that by October ""nobody will know which side of that war he fought on."" So go for it!"
5,They're trying to Ban It--That Tells Us Something !,"A stunning book telling the story of a self-promoting man who, according to over 260 fellow Swift Boat veterans, lied to get his medals, lied about war atrocities to gain influence in the anti-war movement and now wishes to ban the free speech rights of noble men who fought for the right to tell their story. This book is a must-read for all Americans who wish to hear the other side of the Kerry fairytale. Now let's watch the Kerry campaign try to smear all of these veterans. He is disgraceful."
1,Propaganda.,They weren't there. Some said the opposite in print months ago. Some carry a grudge against Kerry for his antiwar remarks when he got back from combat. It puts Kerry on the defensive with regard to his character which is what President Bush will possibly lose the election on--his own lack of principals/judgement/character. So try to cancel that out by smearing his opponents' character.
1,Unfit to Read,This book is nothing more than some bitter person who has not gotten over how he was humililated by John Kerry back in the 1970's. John O'Niell (author) was part of the Nixon smear campaign against John Kerry and he continues his role as Bush's smear campaign not so secret weapon.These so-called witnesses did not serve with John Kerry and most have been impeached by their own statements during the Vietnam Era.This book is 50 percent lies and the other 50 percent bull manure.John Kerry served his country in Vietnam honorably.George W. Bush use his family name to jump ahead of the line for the Texas Air National Guard and was not a volunteer for overseas duty (afterall Vietnam is overseas). He then did not show for his required physical and did not fulfill his service commitment by not showing up for duty.John Kerry -- War Hero. George W. Bush -- Chickenhawk!
5,Memogate II,"Interesting: Dan Rather, 60 Minutes, and CBS were also the main driving forces behind hyping the ""prisoner abuse scandal"". How nicely everything fits!See:http://www.ratherbiased.com/for more information about CBS and Dan Rather.If it turns out that somebody from the DNC is involved in memogate then Kerry is definitely finished (I personally think he is finished as it is, and memogate is merely the last nail in his coffin).10 out of 10 terrorists agree: Anybody but Bush!"
1,A craven attack by a band of zealots. Worthless.,"Just when you thought the Republicans couldn't sink any lower or become any more desperate, along comes this pathetic polemic of libel and distortion. This craven bunch give true veterans a bad name. Their efforts have been underwritten by a millionaire Texas-based zealot and only one of them actually served under Kerry. What's more, they're hypocrites who have the gall to support a president who evaded the draft and then couldn't even fulfill his National Guard duties. Even worse, this same president has the blood of nearly 1,000 (and counting) American servicemen and women on his hands. John McCain was absolutely right in calling on Bush to denounce this book. It truly isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only wish Amazon would allow one to rate items with less than one star."
5,Kerry had a Plan A Super Big PLan,what I got out of this is Kerry wanted to go in theleast bit of attack. and get out quick.his plan was to stay only 4 months. and get outall people should write a review a real reviewthanking the author.
1,Why can't Five Stars answer a simple question? Why can't he provide a single fact?,"I have been chuckling over this single five star poster's nervous squirming when asked to back up his claims. He doesn't seem to be able to answer a very simple question, nor provide a single fact to back up his claims.Instead, he just repeats his lies. Yes indeed, I agree that it does make him an ideal John O'Neill shill.Two more non-responses from Five Stars.Total to date:46Tick tock Five Stars. Time's a-wastin' ."
1,"Despite right-wing propoganda, Bush is struggling! LOL","An overweight, sleazy Texas businessman opposes John Kerry and supports George W Bush for President? Well, you could have knocked me over with a feather!"
1,Liars with no conscience,"These Republicans have learned you can fool a lot of people if you lie and repeat the lie often. It's a ridiculous collection of demonstrably false and misleading statements, for purely political purposes. These men should be ashamed of themselves."
1,wish there was a zero star option,"This book is an insult to US soldiers and their sacrifice. Making light of war wounds earned while fighting for America is beyond wrong. I don't know where these people get the audacity.Since when does being in Vietnam at the same time mean you ""fought with Kerry""?Bush voters supporting this book--how does that make sense? Both Bush and Cheney are draft dodgers.As an American with friends in the service, I am appalled by this book. This hypocrisy MUST end."
5,Why Isn't The Media Reporting This and Other Kerry Lies?,"You can surely tell how honestly this book is written and how hard-hitting it is against Kerry. The media coverage is inversely proportional to the book's truth from those who were there.And it's very telling that Kerry has avoided discussing it at all. Question Kerry's patriotism? I surely do after his return from his 1/3 tour in Viet Nam.Christmas in Cambodia, 1968? And he blames ""the President"" - but he MEANS Nixon - who hadn't even taken office yet.Yes, I surely do question Kerry's patriotism. What's more important though, is that I ALSO QUESTION HIS HONESTY."
4,"Good Read, Yet Still Unconvinced","This book does a pretty decent job of laying out Kerry's war record. It is a relatively fast read and can be soaked in rather quickly. If you are looking for hard evidence about Kerry's record, this book is not very pragmatic. One would think the authors would go the extra half mile to interview veterans to provide the needed evidence. This book will not, however, help you to decide who to vote for in the upcomming election for it provides nothing covering THE ISSUES."
5,Unfit for command:swift boat veterans speak out against john,Good read... facts are backed up with actual testimony .....everyone should buy and read!
1,Save your money - Lies will never pass for literature,What a bunch of lies. The authors shame themselves and the veterans of Vietnam. Give your money to the poor instead of reading this dribble.I suggest those of you that have purchased this book read an article in the Chicago Tribune from a Captain of a swift boat who served with Kerry. He has a first hand account and strong words for the lying authors.Truth is beyond these idiots
1,to much deception,"I checked around 80 of this book's cited in-print sources, and found that the author lied about something in the source publication around one out of every four times.This web page describes twenty-seven of the lies I found:http://www.geocities.com/jefferson108/oneill"
2,This book is based on facts.,"There was a war in Vietnam. That is a provable fact. This book is based on that fact.Beyond that, it's complete drivel regurgitated by paid political hacks. Every single one of Kerry's boatmates and those on nearby boats have backed him 100%.Only sorry losers like the Smearboat Vets who weren't even present during the reported events saw things differently. And most of them have flip-flopped repeatedly on their own versions of events.But if you are a diehard Republican, I'd heartily recommend this book. It should fit right in with your worldview. If you don't have the facts, make crap up."
1,Dont have the money to buy it,u can go to this link and download this for free its the exact same thing http://yarold.ath.cx/sw_rpg/page.php?x=4228556 check it out! just click the unfit.zip file and downlad it thnks!!!
1,UFC: School Children Speak Out Against George W. Bush,"I believe those same school children George W. Bush read to on 9/11 are now writing a book called ""UFC: School Children Speak Out Against George W. Bush"". Let's turn the corner and get Bush out of office! Thanks!"
1,"Begone, foul conservative filth","Get the hell out of Amazon, conservative scum. Leave and never come back. This site will be a much better place without the infestation of conservative, unAmerican, crybaby weaklings. Beat it, you worthless filth."
2,What are the implications,"This book makes me question all veterans who have won medals. If, as the author implies, Kerry could get medals so easily which he did not deserve then I think that all veterans who have earned medals should be questioned. Surely if Kerry could do it then probably everyone else also did the same thing. We can no longer honor any of our decorated veterans. The author of this book has tarnished them all."
1,This Book is full of Lies and Untruths,I dont Know why anyone would buy this book it is a wast of your money.
1,A laughably failed attempt at character assassination,"I can't decide which would be a more appropriate section to list this title uder -""Fiction"", ""Fantasy"", or ""Comedy""? Possibly the lowest, most disgusting Republican-funded smear campaign employed since King Bush used it against John McCain in the 2000 Republican Primary. Peculiar: none of the whiners in this book who claim Kerry didn't deserve his citations seemed to mind the very same language being used in their own Bronze and Silver Star write-ups. Watching the Republican smear machine at its own self-discrediting worst can be kind of entertaining, however. I give it one star for the laughs."
1,Unfit for publishing,"The ""facts"" in this book were refuted the first day it hit book shelves, yet people love to believe all the lies.. The funniest thing I see is all the crazy right wingers taking their ball to play elsewhere b/c of amazon's policy.. HAHA!!!! I don't think they'll miss your 6.99 purchase every 3 months..Onto the book itself, it criticizes a man who volunteered to defend our country, so an ignoramus like Mr.O'Neill can make a few bucks off propaganda.. Why is it everyone in Bush's cabinet couldn't quite make it to Vietnam??"
1,"Tainted ""truth""","It did not require much effort to realize that the ""truth"" as depicted in Fahrenheit 911, ""the democrat's titillator""(you wont find it in the Websters - titallator is my coinage), was to some degree tainted by the predilections of the director.Similarly it shouldn't take too much calorie burn in the neurons to realize that the ""proclaimed truths"" in this book was distorted by the slanderous motives of the publisher, whose notoriety is succinctly captured by the recent New Yorker (Aug 9-16, pp 38) - ""the Publisher is Regnery, which had a best-seller not long ago with a volume alleging that the Clintons hung prophylactics from the branches of the White House Christmas tree"""
5,Kerry exposed,"Kerry served, yes. That's admirable, but his true intentions have finally been exposed. Besides, how can anyone forget his conduct after returning from Vietnam and how it insulted those who died there and those who were still fighting there?Kerry's Vietnam experiences were always intended to serve his political ambitions. Now his lies and dishonor have been brought to light. He is is truly unfit to be Commander in Chief."
1,O'neill was a puppet.,"All you have to know is that John O'neill was used by the Nixon Whitehouse in the early 70s to ""fight back"" against those ""evil"" Vietnam veterans who were protesting and fighting against the vietnam war."
1,This is a good book!,"This is a good book for those that follow the political philosophy of Josef Goebbles that if one fabricates facts long enough the public will start to believe them. Most of this book is based upon hearsay and non-documentary evidence. To date much (but not all) of what has been stated has been discredited. If you love John Kerry bashing this is a great read. Evidence based truth, that must be sought elsewhere."
5,John Kerry betrayed our country!,"While real Americans were bravely defending this country, John Kerry was secretly conspiring with the enemy in Paris. And this is the man who wants us to trust him by making him our commander-in-chief? I don't think so!Read the book and watch for the new SwiftBoat Ads starting today. Check out how John Kerry betrayed the United States of America. It will make your blood boil."
1,"To the unbiased, an obvious smear","I am an Independent, having voted for both Republican and Democratic candidates in local and national elections, and do my best to vote for the better person by getting the most honest and truthful information about each candidate.At first I thought I had wasted time and money on this book: it is such a horrible collection of blatant untruths and clearly unfounded attacks. They give no proof whatsoever that John Kerry did not earn his medals. But now I understand that this is a part of a horrible campaign to defaim an American hero, Kerry. Clearly these people could not find anything bad about Kerry's past, so they had to make up something--and I guess that says a lot about how honest a guy Kerry is.Read the book so that you can understand just how awful attack politics has gotten in the U.S."
1,Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Joh,"Disjoined work of treachery. By men of no moral attributes.Obvious malcontents, unable to kope with reality and the madnessof war. Attackers of character at a time of turmoil and war.When we should all work together, this book promotes confusion, lies and hypocrasy.Not the kind of men I want to watch my back in a firefight.I am 100%SCD from SE Asia. The authors of this book do not want to know what I did for America. They would wet themselves trying to run the other way. Swift boat? More like swift lies to cover their own inefficiencies and predjudes. War is not nice. It is reallity. Lies are a cover for the inability to deal with harsh reality and cowardace.Go creep back under the rock you were pulled from !Lie about my past and I'll find your rock and make sure you stay there.sincerely.Spike."
3,Amazon May Be a Big Store - But They Aren't So Big,"I read the book and I am ready to take them at their word. I am also willing to let this issue alone. What angers me the most is Amazon's position:Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!I would like the ability to use their forum to comment on other political books as well - whether they be anti-Bush, anti-Kerry, or just anti. How about Amazon???? I have been a good customer of yours, how about some slack here?"
2,Lop-sided,"The best book for understanding the Vietnam War is ""A Bright Shining Lie"" by Neil Sheehan, a non-partisan work at least relative to this election. Read it and then determine whether it is Kerry or O'Neil who is more correct. I have heard both sides, seen the Dick Cavett show. You may still want to support Bush, but there is no denying that Kerry served his country honorably. Whether Bush or Kerry get your vote should depend upon your own political beliefs; there is no need to further rationalize your choice by demonizing the opponent."
5,"Amazon's blatant liberal bias. BUY this book, everyone!","Amazon, your liberal bias is blaring. You allow ad hominem attacks for reviews of this fantastic, enlightening book, UNFIT for Command, but ban these reviews for all the other political books you sell on your site. I am liking Overstock more and more these days!!! Everyone should buy and read this book."
1,Democrats are liars,"This is a good book that democrats want to reject because it does not support their agenda. Too Bad for them. If you believe one swift boat veteran (Kerry), why do you not believe another swift boat vet?"
1,Consider the source,"Considering the publisher, Regnery, tells all discerning readers what they need to know about this tome. This is merely an election-year preaching-to-the-neocon-choir diatribe being used to negate the incumbent's scant military regard by demeaning the more distinguished service of his chief opponent.As opposed to the Michael Moore film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" heavily vetted and for which the producer provides line-by-line documentation of factual claims, ""Unfit"" is based almost exclusively on personal accounts made some 30 years after the fact - each of which is specious in its own way, whether it be the previous statements of the sources or the official record. Documentation is rare and does not conform to the specific allegations.This is only for those who read without exercising critical analytic skills."
1,Skip this book!,"I intended to read this book to bone up on Kerry's war record, but there isn't anything in here that hasn't already discussed by the authors or the interviewees on TV. In fact, there is less. The accounts are vague at critical junctures, and each and every claim has already been refuted by Democrat operatives.If I didn't know better, I'd think that O'Neill started working for the Democrat Party when he stopped getting paychecks from Dick Nixon. Go get something by Coulter or Anonymous (Imperial Hubris). There's a lot more in there to tar the Democrats with."
1,Something stinks at Amazon,"Good bye Amazon. This book is the top-seller? I doubt it. Also, looking at a lawn mower makes this book a Suggestion??This is totally ridiculous. As is this book. I would rather have Kerry or almost anyone else instead of the arogant bunch we have now. And at least Kerry went to war instead of Bush and Cheney (""Mr. Deferment"")."
2,A book only right-wingers could love,"I would hope objective readers will recognize this is neither an objective nor non-biased work. John O'Neill is not exactly an uninterested political persona. That the SWIFT vet group is heavily financed by Republicans also gives credence to this.As recent news have shown, many of the claims have been refuted by official records and vets who were actually there. Disparaging Kerry's service because one disagree with his views is rather despicable, but unfortunately typical of right-wing tactics.But as a 'what-if' fictional work, it has some merits."
3,Democracy at its best,"Unfit for Command is an excellent example of why living in America is so wonderful. Just like Michael Moore discovered we get to say what we want regardless of our politics.At the end of the day, as the mother of a soldier, I was hoping that John Kerry was going to provide me with a meaningful plan for leaving Iraq. My son was in the invasion in Iraq in 2003 and has just returned, again with the 3rd ID, he is a true American heroe. He is a class act who is proud to display his CIB and his Army Commendation Medal.Mary Ward""Letters Home"" a memoir of sending a son, an infantryman, to warwww.marehaven.com"
5,democrat trend,"In another fine example of how democrats regularly lie about their military service Kerry is following in the footstep of fellow proven liars, Al Gore(5 months as a bodyguarded photographer), Senator Harkin(claimed flew combat mission when he actually only ferried planes), and of course Democrat President Johnson's silver star(a 13 minute flight as an observer with no hostile fire)If you enjoy truth and freedom then you can't enjoy democrats."
1,Unfit for Command,"This was the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I thought non-fiction books were supposed to be true but this book belongs next to Robert Ludlum. The book is filled with ramblings and lies and is not worth the read. By now the truth has come out that John Kerry's version on his time in Vietnam is completely accurate, which debunks this whole godawful book. If you want the facts don't read this piece of angry, hate-driven trash."
1,Unfair,"I think that this was an unfair attack on John Kerry. He would have been a better President than other people because he has actually seen action instead of asking his daddy to get him into the Guard and then go A.W.O.L from it.Another thing that I hate about this book is that it is the Swift Boat vets were not there when the stuff they talk about was happening, and then not telling the truth about the incidences they detail. After reading another book that details their lies (The Truth by Al Franken)I believe they were payed by someone associated with George Bush to put this garbage out there."
1,what trash,I was hoping for a real expose on Kerry. Instead I was entertained by a Rush Limbaugh version of nonsense. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. Shame on you.Gus Ozag
5,Thank you Lawrence Corra! I just bought my copy at the bookstore!,It seems that a lot of bookstores were sold out of Unfit For Command but interest is certainly picking up and now bookstores can't even keep it on the shelves. Not sure why. Maybe it's because Halloween is right around the corner and Kerry looks so much like Herman Munster! People should put put this on their window sills right next to their pumpkins. Or in t heir basements to scare away the rats!
5,"260 against Kerry versus 10 for Kerry, who do you believe?","I just got my copy because my book store was sold out. I read the entire book and I have read the rebuttals here. In my opinion, Swift Boat Vets have 260 Veterans telling their side of the story about Kerry based on what they saw. Kerry had only 10 supporting him. Why only 10? I'm going with the Swift Boat vets besides, Kerry has never effectively refuted any of this and if any of this were false, O'neill, Corsi and all of the Swift Boats Vets who freely listed their names would have lawsuits filed against them.No lawsuits, it must be true. 260 against Kerry versus only 10 for Kerry. Like last years election where Kerry lost by more than 3 1/2 million votes, majority wins. I agree with the Swift Boat Vets."
1,Oh Please...,"This book is a joke. I could really honestly care less about what Kerry (or Bush) did 30 years ago. The claims in this book are based on lies and unfounded rumors. www.mediamatters.org has debunked all the claims in this book so far. Anyone interested in the truth would like to check out that site.Bush's record isnt exactly clear either, take a look at www.realchange.org, a non-partisain website that digs up the dirt on all presidential candidates."
3,Military Records Contradict Thurlow,"Newly obtained military records of one of Sen. John F. Kerry's most vocal critic, who has accused the Democratic presidential candidate of lying about his wartime record to win medals, contradict his own version of events. - Washington PostHow do you rate a book if you can't tell whether its fiction or non-fiction?"
1,A disgrace,"That such an obvious piece of character assasination is actually being believed by people is incredible. This book appears full of distorted and misleading ""facts"" and shows only the lengths that extreme Republicans are going to in order to hang onto power. A disgrace (as John McCain, I think, said)."
1,Ho hum..STILL no facts from Five Stars,"You'd think Five Stars would have been able to come up with a single fact to back up his claims by now. After all, it's been more than a month and a half now. But nope, more of the same nonsensical nonanswers.Four more since he was last asked to back up his claims.Total to date:39"
1,swift boat sleazers scuttle the truth!,"These people have slandered and made light of every Veteran who has ever earned a medal, by implying that almost any one can decorate themselves. In light of the evidence piling up daily to refute these bottom suckers it is hard to believe anyone would spring for the price. Save your $$$ it sucks."
1,Complete and utter GOP garbage,This is total garbage. I read this trash in 2 days. Bottom line---this guy NEVER MET KERRY. Enough Said
2,curious,Isn't it strange that only one other person has reviewed a book that's an amazon #1 top seller for weeks? In fact I bet it's unprecedented in amazon's history. Check for yourself. Not one of the presumably 1000's of people who have bought the book has bothered to review it. Or has it been bulk-ordered to get it to the top of the list and make campaign news?
5,"Read This Book...and Then Read ""Reckless Disregard!""","This is an outstanding, well-researched, documented and heartfelt work from O'Neill and Corsi. I URGE people from all political persuasions to read it. O-Neill and Corsi write from conviction, not from political hatred as is the norm for Michael Moore, Al Franken and Maureen Dowd. When you finish ""Unfit for Command,"" pick up Buzz Patterson's excellent work ""Reckless Disregard."" Patterson covers the same material referencing John Kerry but takes the argument much deeper. He delves into why liberals feel the way they do about national security and compares Kerry's abysmal record not only in Vietnam but the Senate to the horrible terms of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Patterson, as does O'Neill, speaks from firsthand experience. He was Clinton's Air Force Aide during the 90s and carried the nuclear football. Both books should be read in tandem. Once doing so, you'll be voting Republican this election."
1,A great historical and hysterical book!,"Thanks to the 99 cent bargain bin, I finally broke down to read this thing. Sadly, I could not stop laughing. It is so poorly written, and the spelling errors are a plenty.However, the attempt to discredit Kerry is the most humorous. None of it makes sense. I could actually care less about Kerry. I would have voted for a monkey over bush. But you can tell that this entire thing called a book was rushed, and fabricated for election purposes only. The entire project was funded by Republicans who cannot think outside their programmed heads I guess.Sad.Very sad.But... I could not stop laughing."
1,Crybaby CONservatives fear a REAL hero,"I can smell your fear, conservatives. You SHOULD be scared. Your candidate turned tail and went AWOL, too scared to finish out his duty. Then he lied about it in his autobiography. His ""character"" and ""honesty"" are about par for the course with conservatives. None of you are trustworthy.When you vote for Bush, you are signing your death warrant. He will get us all killed. He has already made America demonstratably weaker in the world. Bush is already a war criminal, and should be held for treason against the Constitution. A vote for the scumbag is also an act of treason.None of you lowlifes can handle a REAL veteran hero--John Kerry. He didn't go AWOL, like your pantywaist candidate did.Your guy is a lying AWOL coward.Your guy is a lying AWOL coward.Your guy is a lying AWOL coward."
3,Why no investigation??,The only reason I give 3 stars is that there must be some truth to it. There has been no investigation by the major media into these claims. No demands that Kerry release all of his records as was properly done with Bush's AWOL charges. Why is this? If this is a book of lies why not release the records and tell these guys to shove it?As for those who said these guys weren't in the same boat as John must not have read the book. They never claimed to be in the boat with him. But they were in boats right next to him. That's like saying you didn't serve with someone becuase you were in the jeep next to him.If what these guys say is true it's a 5 star service to their country warning us of an opportunistic untrustworthy candidate. If it's a pack of lies by a group backed by the Republicans it's a 1. The only way to tell is for Kerry to release his records.
1,Republicans are losers.,"I thought I'd check out some of the reviews for this book, and I must say that I am quite alarmed at what I am reading. These people are so angry, it's scary. I guess they're upset that their president is kind of dumb and is going to lose in a couple of months.I'm sure that someone else is going to respond to this review with more hate and fury, but I don't care. I can relax, knowing that we will have a competent leader in 2005."
2,"Unfit for Command, too over the top","There are just too many holes being poked in the claims that this book makes. While the book is fairly well-written, anyone who has read recent newspaper articles will be disappointed that the book fails to explain why Kerry's crew is actively supporting him, why so many of Kerry's commanders at the time gave him citations and medals, why several of the Swift Vets (like Larry Thurlow) have records from the time contradicting their claims. John O'Neil should have been more open about the fact that the Nixon team appointed him to go after Kerry when Kerry was an anti-war activist. It would have helped with his creidibility. I suppose it's a fine book for Bush supporters and those who wanted the Vietnam war to continue, but I would not recommend it for people who want a fair view of Kerry."
1,Gross Slander on a Great American,"John Kerry's heroic bravery proves him to be one of the greatest war heroes in American history, in four months he rightfully earned three purple hearts, the bronze star and the silver star, truth be told, he probably deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor.But his real bravery was after the war, when he boldly marched before Congress and told the truth that the Vietnam vet who was little more than a baby killer. Kerry boldly exposed the war crimes committed by the majority of vets that he had the displeasure of serving with.This book is little more than whining by a bunch of murderers and cowards who will never ever be able to stand in Kerry's shadow."
1,Hmmm?,"Ultimately one will have to decide for oneself as to Kerry's fitness for command. I found the book obviously partisan and consequently irrelevent. Whether you regard Kerry as a 'hero' or not, one thing is irrefutable...he did volunteer and unless virtually all of his crewmates are liars and all the Navy reports are false,he did perform admirably. I suggest you weigh his credentials for 'fitness of command' against George Bush Jr.s. One candidate is clearly lacking and it isn't John Kerry"
5,Reverse Psychology only works on Dumb-o-crats!,"Isn't it all so obvious that the reviewer using the handle ""Roman Wedge"" and posting 5 stars on his reviews is the same Kerry fan writing all of that 1 star opinions without facts junk? DUH! This only works on democrats guy. You ain't fooling anybody.And isn't it funny how anytime someone posts the truth about Kerry, that he was no hero and support that with facts, this same Kerry fan inundates those reviews with unhelpful votes and tries to bury those reviews with his trash?Well golly Sergeant Carter, if Kerry and his only fan weren't worried about the reviews, let alone what is in the book (the true, real undisputed facts) then why, why are they so intensely ""trying"" (note trying and failing) to prevent the truth from being told?Nobody needs to make a fool out of this Kerry fan, he does a great job of it all by himself!By the way, Kerry does look a lot like Gomer Pyle in his Navy uniform doesn't he? But at least Gomer was lovable."
1,Bush: Commander-in-Chief? Chicken-in-Chief is more like it,"Is John Kerry fit to command? I don't know for sure but one thing I do know is I'll take an established war veteran over our pot smoking, coke snorting, alcoholic current commander-in-chief who didn't even have the guts to serve out his National Guard duty, let alone serve in the war, like a real man. Sure, forget the vets rest of your term, then come crying to us when you need a vote in the election, Bush.As for these Republican ""sissymen"" who keep trying to give this book five star reviews just cause they think it hurts Kerry, well, I'd like to see how they would do in a real war. They would probably run away crying for their mamas if anyone ever shot at them. Let's see these weasley little jerks over in Iraq where the real war is taking place right now, then see how they do."
1,"Check your history, This book is simply not true","I have read both pro and con John Kerry books, and I feel that this book is very untrue. John O'neill focused his efforts on people who didn't serve in close proximity with John Kerry, rather he based things on opinions of people who simply did not like Senattor Kerry. This is a shady interpretaion of facts. If you research your history, you will know that John O'neill was a puppet of the Nixon Administration, who was simply put out front to try to put a good face on the Vietnam War. He was Nixon's ""rebuttle"" to John Kerry in the early 1970's. I think that Mr. O'neill still holds a grudge from what happened 30 years ago, and that is a poor reason to try to slander a public official running for president"
1,Slanderous Propaganda,"John O'Neill was recruited in the 70's by then President Nixon to smear John Kerry for his anti-war activism. Apparently his mission is not yet accomplished. O'Neill wants you to believe that men hundreds of yards away from Kerry's boat have a more accurate picture of what happened during Kerry's service than those actually ON Kerry's boat. That ridiculous notion speaks for itself.The co-author, Jerome Corsi, has a few notable quotes which give insight into HIS character:* Corsi on Islam: ""a worthless, dangerous Satanic religion""* Corsi on Catholicism: ""Boy buggering in both Islam and Catholicism is okay with the Pope as long as it isn't reported by the liberal press""* Corsi on Muslims: ""Ragheads are Boy-Bumpers as clearly as they are Women-Haters -- it all goes together"""
1,Lying liars...,You'll love it if you're already going to vote for Bush and need to feel better about it. Unreadable if you are interested in the truth.Just more propaganda from the Bush reelection campaign. These guys own military records prove they are lying to discredit Kerry. If these guys want truth: go find out were Bush was while he was AWOL from the National Guard.
1,These guys really dislike Kerry,"One previous reviewer wrote this as, apparently, some kind of praise for the Authors. The makers of Farenheit 9/11 really dislike Dubya, so I guess that would be their positive in that reviewers eyes. Personally, I feel it is the weakness of both works.Like Farenheit, this book was written with the end result already decided. This book is less a research into anyone's ability to command than it is a well researched, footnoted propoganda pamphlet. I came into this book hoping for a balanced arguement over Kerry's abilities, instead I got a basic smear campaign.It is also based on an arguement that seems to lose all of it's steam. Kerry is to be villified for his service in Vietnam, while Dubya is to be held above contempt for his brave service in Texas? Does Dubya have some purple heart from a tumbleweed incident I'm not aware of?"
1,Hatchet Job,"Sorry, but these guys did not ""serve"" with Kerry, other than to be in his vicinity. The publicly available documentary evidence--including earlier testimony by several of these Joes--refutes the nonsense. I suppose Chicken-hawk ""Mission Accomplished"" George W. had to do something to divert attention from his own draft dodging for the privileged, the National Guard. But don't let the facts bother you, go ahead and support the WMD-not-found Liar-in-Chief. You are a millionaire, aren't you?"
5,Glorious music,"I fully agree with my fellow reviewer; this music is a joy from start to finish.I had already tasted and enjoyed Tviett on a Naxos disc my wife bought me so, when I saw this disc in a half price sale, money exchanged hands before you could say, bargin.I would urge anyone who enjoys romantic music to buy this cd. I would buy it again at double it's recommended price, never mind half price.The film composer John Williams has obviously been influenced by Tviett's music in his past, therefore, if you have enjoyed the 'symphonic' film scores of Williams (as I have), you will love the music of Tviett.Highly recommended. Go and buy."
3,5 Little Pumkins,"Overall I am happy with the purchase. The seller rated the condition as ""Very Good""... I would have rated it as ""Good""... I expected it to be in a little better condition with that high of a rating. But it really isn't that big a deal, I bought the book for my 1 yr old neice so she could start learning one of my favorite stories from when I was a small child. I'm pretty sure she is not concerned with the overall condition of the book. It was still a good buy."
3,Scratched cd,"Shipping was fast, unfortunately the CD was scratched so I couldn't even watch 3 whole scenes of the movie which was very disappointing ."
3,A documentary of sexual abuse,"From this movie's self-description, you might think this is a a benign documentary about the life and art of a Philadelphia muralist. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This documentary is about a deeply disturbed man who was repeatedly sexually molested as a child and about all the ensuing horror in his life, his art, and in the lives of those around him. Yes, the man makes murals in Philaelphia but honestly this movie is not about that. If you want to see a movie about murals, look elsewhere; I wish I had."
3,Fine,"This item is about as expected. The problem I had is that it was a little too small for my iron. And, because it seems to be meant for a different type of ironing board than the one I have, the whole thing didn't fit right. But, it's made of slightly flexible wire (actually much thicker than wire) , so I managed to pry/pull and manipulate it to fit my stuff. It's still an awkward fit so it's not very efficient getting my things in/out of it, but it works, and most importantly, stores them out of sight. So it turns out that irons and ironing boards aren't all universal sizes. I probably *should* have known that before but I didn't. Still, you can make it work... It's not perfect, but good enough."
3,Brit stix hit hix,"Matchbox was a mid/late '70's retro British band so in love w/ Rockabilly that they ALMOST got it. Clearly they bend down at the beat, pumped up bass and had a fine Carl Perkins attitude..but mostly were devoted. Their first LP/CD hardly known/hard to find is kinda fun..but merely a precursor to their second better LP..."
4,Really Funny,"I read a lot of reviews on this movie and I am glad I waited until after I watched it to read these reviews or I might have missed a really funny movie. I am not one who gets into comedy as Horror is my favorite genre but my baby sister wanted to watch this and I must admit I thought it was going to be boring and stupid but I was pleasantly surprised. I am a movie watcher who doesn't really like Jack Black I don't usually find him funny and I am not sure if he was the funny one in this movie either, Michael Cera's character was the best. My little sister and I laughed almost through the entire movie, you can't watch it with too much thought-you have to just let it be what it is and I think you will enjoy it. Give it a shot, it might not be to everyones tastes but my sister and I enjoyed it, I am going to buy it soon to add to my little collection of comedies."
2,Not too good,"Year One is written and directed by Harold Ramis and produced by Judd Apatow. These are two men that know comedy, yet this movie has very few laughs. It could have been a funny spoof of films like 10,000 BC and Apocalypto but instead it's pretty boring and forgettable.An early scene where Jack Black teaches Cera how to pick up women by hitting them in the head with a club was clver. But sadly that's the one scene I remember being funny. Cavemen picking up women with pick-up lines of today only got small chuckles from me. Many of the other jokes are just tasteless and dumb kind of stuff that you'd expect from the Wayans.The big cast is just wasted. Especially Olivia Wilde (House). Paul Rudd, Bill Hadar and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Multiplicity and Badazzled are considered flops that Ramis directed but those films were even a lot better than Year One."
1,One funny scene and that's it,"Have you ever watched a movie where the only good scenes in the movie were the exact ones in the trailer? That's what happened with Year One.The only funny scene in this movie is when Michael Cera's character asks to adjust his helmet and announces he forgot his sword. That same clip was on the trailer, which I laughed at, and was the reason I even saw this movie. I assumed the rest of the movie would be just as funny.But it wasn't. First of all, I don't think Jack Black is funny. I think he tries too hard to be silly and goofy and it doesn't do anything for me.Michael Cera's mumbling, awkward adolescent act worked on the show ""Arrested Development"", but it wasn't enough to save a bad script.So, besides that one funny scene, the rest of the movie was a bore."
1,"$1 at Redbox, and even then I still want to sue...","Dont waste your time with this P.O.S. The follows the usual trajectory of Jack Black's career; incompetent, a criminal waste of time, and worst of all a freaking ripoff. I keep wondering how Jack Black ever gets parts? He gotta have a close family member in the Hollywood elite. My favorite jack Black movie was his appearance in The Jackal with Bruce Will where his character was killed realtively early on in the film. Words cant describe how this movie sucks. I honestly felt like I was punk'd! The director should do everyone a favor and go back to selling sell hotdogs; anything but directing after making this. Wish I could have used it for toilet paper, but then, that would have added prestige to the quality"
2,"A few chuckles, otherwise Black's worst to date","I usually really bust a gut at Jack Black's movies and looked forward to this one. After 100 minutes though I had mildly laughed a few times and found some scenes just downright crude. I'm a long-time fan of his work, but this was a waste of time. I'd rather watch ""Nacho Libre"" again any day. Good acting, fine cast, great sets...slow and boring movie. Even a few of the same Black gags...it's been done once, I was surprised to see it done again. Sorry, but thumbs down."
4,Guilty pleasure,"This movie is stupid funny with a message. It makes some good points regarding the bizarre things we humans do in the name or religion. It isn't as biting satire of religion as Life of Brian, but it goes in the library with it."
1,Skip this for sure ... unless you just have to have it.,"I bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of George Orwell's book came out, simply because it was attached to the movie. I'll try not to use any non-family words here, but this soundtrack sucks. Muldowney's original score is available on CD, and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie. As far as this soundtrack goes, though; skip it."
4,This CD made me angry,"Well, in a good way. I actually saw this film and believe the original score should have been preserved. However, this CD (by the Eurythmics) alone is an excellent collection of themes based on the George Orwell classic and the parallels of todays society.Caution: It may cause you to rebel against your government.;^)"
4,Double Plus Good,"The missing link in my Eurythmics collection - finally fixed! This CD is rarer than hens teeth for some reason, but there are some really great sounds that Dave and Annie created for this soundtrack. ' Julia' and 'For The Love Of Big Brother' are my two favourite tracks - but the whole album still sounds fresh after - O.M.G. - 26 years!"
3,"Worth it for ""Julia"" alone.","Sexcrime and DoublePlusGood as referred to in other reviews are cheesy but enjoyed the instrumental tracks and of course, Julia. The track is worth ownership of the CD alone. This is one of those songs you'll hear the first time, love it's beautiful melancholy and can never forget it. Every note, instrument and vocal track seem to blend perfectly for maximum emotional impact. I consider it the best work this talented duo has recorded."
4,Actually a very even-handed textbook,"I have taught history to 7th graders in Washington using this text for 5 years. Yes, it covers the history of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Mesoamerica in addition to the usual Eurocentric view of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. As with all texts for middle grade students, it probably does not get into the ""negatives"" of any of these civilizations in depth. True, some of Mohammad's less savory practices are not discussed, but neither is the fact that thousands of children were virtually kidnapped during the Crusades to die on the front lines of losing battles in the Holy Land or that girls in China had their feet brutally bound to help keep them subservient. My only complaint about this very thorough text is that it is on too high a reading level for some of my struggling readers, although there are good supplemental materials to help with this."
5,great laces,"great product. if you know youre going to keep your laces tied in the same way (sometimes runners need them laced up for different foot problems) its worth it. so easy, so fast."
4,Replace your laces,"All my shoes are slip-ons now, and more comfortable. Especially helpful for folks with arthritis. I use these with the zero friction fittings often."
3,Directions don't make any sense,"I just put the laces on my Merrell Trail Gloves and they fit fine and serve their purpose. I am a lazy person who does not like to tie his shoes, so this product was great for me. When reading the instruction it's mentioned ""step 5"" for running. It tells you to tie knots at the end of the quick release once you reached a desired fit. But when you do this, you prevent the laces from loosening and cant get the shoes off. I disregarded this step and they still work fine while running.I gave it three stars because I recently tried on a pair of Vibram Five Fingers and it had a quick lace system that allowed the excess lace bundle to be Velcroed onto itself so it doesn't flop around while running. He little knot hider smacks your foot a lot and I had to tuck it into the bottom of the laces. I think if this company were going to expand their product line, they could look into something. Like that."
1,Don't buy them... make them!,"$10 for this? Really? You can buy 3 mm (1/8 in.) shock cord for $0.30/foot at Annapolis Performance Sailing (APS). [...]Then get some toggles. I found this on Amazon, unsure of how competitive the price is, though. http://www.amazon.com/Amico-Plastic-Toggle-Spring-Single/dp/B008AOUNHS/ref=wl_mb_hu_m_1_dpI spent a whopping $12 at APS and got 4 different colors and enough shock cord to outfit 100 pairs of shoes. APS sells only Novatec brand cord (highest quality cord available).One more thought, having extra shock cord is great for my kids. They pull ridiculously hard on the elastic and then a couple of months, it wears/shreads the elastic and then they're trash. Since I have bulk cord, I simply replace the elastic.Don't waste your money on these laces, just make them yourself!"
5,Lock Laces are 'Rock' Laces!,I have back and hip problems and have to get someone to tie my left shoe. Now with Lock Laces I can slip into any pair of lace shoes and they are as snug as if I had tied them. I have them on 4 pair of sneakers and one pair of more dress show (black)
5,Great product,Great product. Got this for my kids whos shoelaces always untie at the wrong moment. Works great and easy to use and kids loe them.
5,Bought 5 Pairs Already,"I started out buying two pairs of pink Lock Laces because I was tired of lacing my 2 and 4 year old daughters' shoes. That idea worked so well that I realized they might also be helpful replacement laces for my running shoes. I had been caught on a few occasions in races with untied shoes, and there is nothing worse than having to stop in the middle of a run to re-tie your shoes. Like all of the other positive reviewers that have come before me, I have found them to serve that purpose very well. I have used them on three pairs of shoes so far and have no complaints so far.Since these are one-length fits all, I should note that I've found the length to be more than adequate for my running shoes. I tend to cut off about 3 inches of slack after tying the knot at the end. If you're looking to put these on shoes/boots that have many more than 6-7 eyelets, however, you might not have enough lace to make it."
1,after one year doesn't work any more,After one year of owning this scale I replaced the batteries and it stopped working.
4,Excellent bedwetting solution !!!,"My wife and I had tried to manage our 8 y.o.'s bedwetting problem with all other existing methods, but nothing worked. Bought this alarm last month, October '09. After 2 weeks of using it, bedwetting stopped. We still used it for 1 more week and saw no more wet nappies. After the 3rd week we decided to pack it back into its original packing and keep it for in case. Till today no problems again. I'll wait 1 more week and if not used again I'll try to sell it (discounted price), (it's like new). This alarm is the choice to treat bedwetting!!!I have rated 4 stars due difficult to handle buttons."
3,IS he getting better?,"B has always a good writing style. he is getting more inventing, and learning to make the characters more interesting. he is learning to carry out on amore deatiled level too, like combats. but this wasn't as good as the first book. there were some uninteresting stuff here, and the plot took a too much stereotypical turn for me. but masybe it's a ""second book thing"". haven't read the third one. anyway, it's still a good read from a , hopefully, ""growing"" writer"
3,"From my point of view, not his best work","Length:: 4:10 MinsWhat in the world was he thinking this time? I found this book to be very different and below par from his others. It was as if he went into the world of more science fiction when he started dealing with the technology and machines of the old world. I understand he hinted at this in other books, but I never thought he would create a murdering library for heavens sakes. Not for my taste among his magic and myth point of view that his other writings attain to."
3,"Dear, dear.....","What is this load of nonsense?I've certainly seen better from Terry.....Such a disappointment, I truly hope the finale will buck up immensely.The book seems a bit too rushed at times. Whilst Book 1, Isle Witch was a tad slow, this one moved in a snail's pace.But, before all you Terry Brooks fans start throwing rotten tomatoes at me, please let me point out: this book is not bad...... sure, it ain't bad, but it just doesn't cut it.... And to think I was waiting for this book to come out.... A bit of an anti-climax, if you ask me....Also, a word of caution: If you hadn't read Book 1, please do so before you attempt this book. That's because you won't know what on Earth is happening to the main charcaters at all!!Oh well, I give it the...rating of ....3 stars."
2,Not to exciting,I wasn't impressed with this book at all. Illustrations were poor and so was the story line. It didn't really give my son a feel for what was going to happen. The only plus was it did show the mommy's tummy growing and growing and eventually there was a baby. But it didn't really touch on how the other child felt or how anyone felt really.
1,unsatisfactory transaction,I ordered a spanish edition and received a french edition. I also complained about this and received no answer. This was a totally unsatisfactory transaction and I would like to receive some communication about how this can be corrected.John W Brahn
5,great book by great surgeon,I was always looking for a book that can give me clear understanding and comperhensive coverage to the subject of acetabular fractures till I found the fractures of the acetabulum by Emile Letournel and I didn't believe the amount of knowldge given by this author and the effort behind this book and his experience over 40 years in assessing and treating pelvic and acetabular fractures I recommended this book to every orthopaedic surgeon to be his reference in treating acetabular fractures.
4,very interesting read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. as a fan of berlin, and having visited it first during the cold war, and several times since, it brings an interesting perspective to this city which is always changing, always reinventing itself. not only is the author asking valid questions relating to the history, demolition and reconstruction of numerous berlin monuments but also adds the viewpoint of the berliner mentality in regards to historic validity, often a balance of imperial/nazi/cold war times weighed against current relevance. surely many of the questions and issues raised are asked any time a society is dealing with historic architecture; the fact that berlin has had such a colorful past is what makes this book a compelling read."
3,Motorola HS815 Bluetooth Headset,"It's very difficult to get on your ear, two hands are required, volume for the other end of the call in low. Great value if you're not in a hurry and don't care if people cant here you. WHAT DID YOU SAY; I CAN GET THIS DAMN THIN ON MY EAR."
1,Save Your $$$,"This headset arrived 3 days early and worked perfectly for about 2 weeks.[The supplier did their job above and beyond - the review is about the actual headset]THEN the internal charging connection fell out, and that was all she wrote - I have a $20.00 display piece with broken guts.Save your money and buy a better Motorola Bluetooth - this one isn't worth it."
3,Bulky ear piece,I found this headset to be quite bulky with the mouthpiece that sticks out. I returned it and went with another Motorola model.
1,did not like,"I bought this pillow for my husband, he did not like it at all. I tried it as well and do not like it.I would have liked to have returned it, but there was no info with the pillow about returns, no invoice or anything.It was hard, heavy and noisy. I am currently using it to go under my knees at night, and it is good for that."
5,Amazing book!,This book is amazing. Gets to the heart of Christianity through the lives and actions of people that have shown God's love to our world. They are unlikely mentors but each one gave me a new or renewed faith in the one living God.
4,searching for french's bands,"indochine are the best group that i have ever listened!! at last at the moment, ""3 nuits par semain""!!!..,another song ""Le Manoir""it s one of my favorites, the firs song is as electronic-pop songs of the earlies 80'S ,and for this reason i love this band."
2,WHERE IS KEVIN,"Kevin and Gary have written a good cd, a shame Kevin left the group, and Mike came in and rerecorded the vocals. Ridin the Storm kicks butt. But rest of the cd suffers without Kevin. Mike's vocals give the group too much of a country feel, and it would be even more so on the next two cds with him. Still there are some good songs in here, SOn of a Poor Man, Start A New Life, It's Everwhere, and Without Expression. If you don't go into this expecting your classic REO, you may just like this."
3,"Early REO, before Kevin Cronin made them a real band...","The music on this album is essentially what you'd expect from bands of the early seventies - Certainly not anywhere near the quality or depth of their first sensational album - Hi Infidelity, which got me hooked on REO. I must say that ""Ridin' The Storm Out"" is one of their best early songs, but the live version is arguably more memorable than this studio version. Also, ""Time For Me To Fly"" was excellent, but is found on ""You can Tune a Piano, But You Can't Tuna Fish"" album. Without Kevin Cronin, this album doesn't really sound like anything most folks will associate with REO of the late 70's and 80's, when they were putting out stellar hits like ""Take It On The Run"", ""Keep On Loving You"", ""In My Dreams"" and ""I Can't Fight This Feeling""."
1,Gawd Awful,This is probably the worst REO release. It proves REO is nothing without Kevin Cronin. Stick with the live version of the song.
3,Patrick is such a fun instructor,"I first saw Patrick Goudeau on Fitness TV and fell in love with his style. He is such an energetic instructor. I got the ""Having a Ball with ABC,"" and ""Dumb Training"" DVDs and loved so much that I decided to get the Dance Remix and Dance Moves.I'm not an aerobics, choreography type of person. I have such a hard time trying to follow those 80's style aerobics' class that screams grapevine to the left, grapevine to the right. The DVD was very good, but it wasn't for me. I rather stand in place and hold a dumbbell. So for those people that are not very well coordinated, this would not be for you. But for others that are looking for some fun cardio, this would be a good choice."
4,A return to form,"While I doubt there would ever come a day when I wouldn't read a new book of his, I do have to say that it's felt to me for a while (since Wind-Up Bird Chronicle) like he wasn't exactly in his groove any more. Maybe it was the tighter focus of those later books that didn't appeal to me as much. Whatever the reason, After the Quake is the man at his best. The stories are short and the book is overall a quick read, but that... density... is back. Each one bears re-reading. I still wouldn't recommend it as the best starting point (I for some reason always recommend Sheep Chase or Hardboiled for that), but still, great stuff."
4,NEW YORK MAGAZINE,Ordered this Magazine during 2008 Election year to provide additional political views. It was on Amazon.com sale price.It also gives varied articles on New York Restaurants and fashion for those that might be interested in those things. I mainly read the political articles.
5,BEST PRICE,"A pleasant surprise to find such a great price !Also great customer service ,every question I had was answered promptly and pleasantly. I've subscribed to NEW YORK for over 21 years, would never be without it."
4,Great rates for magazine subscription for magazines,"I have gotten this magazine subscription from various sources over the last decade, but the price on Amazon could not be beat. Very informative for things to do and restaurants to eat at when in New York City. Plus, the articles are great."
5,"The Granny-man, tender hearted, cat lovers must read","The Granny-man is a heartwarming story about an old cat who has just about given up on daily life, but then finds his usefulness once more when the new kitten arrives. Judy Schachner, author of the Skippyjon Jones books, really captured a wonderful theme we can all relate to... learning to find one's usefulness and finding new joy in life! Cat lovers will really love this book, no matter how old or how young; it's a wonderful read!"
5,More and Better,"The story of Alex and Seregil and the impending war between two countries comes to a full-tilt, action, thrilling culmination in the second title in the series. And yet, there's more to come even still.All the secondary characters become as vividly portrayed as the leads, and the world becomes so vividly real in your imaginations, you can see the cities, the countrysides, the homes of the characters.Magic and kidnapping, major evil and heroic feats. Strong female characters and a country with a tolerance level for all people, you want to go there!Great fun!"
5,My Favorite Sword and Sorcery Book,"For me this book has it all: great suspense, a slowly building love affair, great drama, some of the most horrific tortures/killings I've ever encountered ( even in Steven King)= some which haunted me for years they were so vivid,great tales of magic, and the surprising tale of love between the two male protagonists. it is a powerfully told tale that should be as famous as The Lord of the Rings."
4,Great book but.....,"I enjoyed Luck of the Shadows very much, then started in on Stalking Darkness, it's also very well written, however I do feel uncomfortable with Alec and Sergil's attraction for each other. It's hard to feel any connection to these characters when you know they are gay. The homosexuality theme sort of crept into the novel, and there is more of it in ""Traitor's Moon"". I've only read the first few pages, but the relationship between these two men continues. Thus creating a Catch-22, you want to see how the story ends, but you don't want to hear about the ""relationship"" between Alec and Sergil."
1,$9.00 for shippping???,"I did not order this item because while the merchandise price may be fair, the shipping cost is abs. ridiculous!!! I can purchase this item at my local craft store for much less. I go to Amazon looking for a deal. This is far from - a deal! Why waste shoppers time?"
3,"Okay, But not Good nor Really Bad!",This movie is okay. It's not good but it's not really bad either. This movie isn't all that scary but it does have a few good moments. Not a movie to view and scream when watching it.
1,avoid Fever Lake,"Corey Haim and Mario Lopez team up for this sorry tale about 6 college friends who head off for a weekend getaway at a family home of Haim's. Needless to say there's nothing new here and what unfolds is a pointless attempt at a horror movie that offers nothing as far as a storyline, a laugh, or a scare. Even the most diehard Corey Haim fan should avoid this movie."
1,The best part of the movie was looking at Lauren Parker.,"The movie was a waste of money to make. Like i said, the best parts were of Lauren. Need i say more. I would like to find some pictures of her. wildwolf@mnsi.net"
2,Bloated and Dull,"Whenever a Stephen King book approaches or surpasses the 1000 page mark, the reader should beware (the exception is the uncut version of ""The Stand""). What you're in for is a lot of unnecessary bloat, and ""The Talismen"" is no exception. King's stories are better the closer to plausible reality he keeps them and this books best parts don't take place in the mythical otherworld created by King and Straub. Part of the problem here might be that each author may have been too polite to ask the other to trim his sections of the writing. The fate of the book resembles that of many rock'n'roll supergroups; a mediocre effort not worthy of the reputation of the participants."
4,The Talisman,"Quite different from what I have been reading, but it was very good! I could almost tell KING'S writing from Straub's (?) writing. All in all I really enjoyed it...I feel lost if I don't have a ' Stephen ' book to read everyday!"
3,Talisman,Not my favorite book. His mind wanders off a lot. Hard to follow.I find myself just reading to get through it
5,Best Book ever written!,"The Talisman is the best book I have ever read in my life! It has nonstop action and you will never be able to put the book down! Stephen King has a way of making you feel like the characters are your best friends. I've only read 4 of his books, but this one is by far the best. Besides the cursing and a few overly gruesome descriptions this book is spectacular!"
3,Tighter editing would be nice,"""The Talisman"" is a good tale but it could have been better if some portions were trimmed back. I should imagine that further editing would have resulted in a 50 page tightening and a much better story. Further it seemed too convenient for Jack to 'flip' to an alternate 'territory' whenever he got into a tight spot. After a number of these timely 'flips' I felt as though King was copping out rather than devising a more 'real' escape. Wolfie was cool! Wolf!!"
2,Two many cooks (pun intended) spoiled the book,"It may have sounded like a good idea to have Stephen King and Peter Straub collaborate on a horror book, but the idea doesn't pan out in reality. The book leapfrogs back and forth without rhyme or reason; we don't really get into the plot; and the really interesting character, Wolf, not the book's pedestrian protagonist Jack Sawyer, doesn't remain in the story long enough to satisfy us. The real problem with ""The Talisman"", though, is that the writers' styles don't mesh; they clash instead of complimenting each other and it gives the book a stilted and uncomfortable tone. King and Straub are each fine writers on their own, but this book is ample testimony to the fact that two good writers don't necessarily add up to one good book."
5,top 1o book,"this book is real real good!! i love reading books alot and this one is one of my top books ever,its fun,sad and scary,and suspenseful all in just this one book.straub and king really where a good team for this book,this book helps me get over the passing of my mother becouse in this book he has to help his mother befor she dies....look if your a fan of king or straub or just book period then buy this book you will injou it alot."
4,Overall a good book,"A tale about a young boys quest to save his mother and the struggles and adversity he faces along the way. It's written by Stephen King and Peter Straub, and I felt like I could tell when King was writing vs when Straub was, probably because I've read most of King's work. The book never freaked me out or scared me, but it did make me cry out of sorrow once. I was never pulled in completely to where I couldn't put the book down, it was missing something but overall I thought it was a good book."
5,"A really long, gooooood book!!!","The Talisman is a very good book. It is about a boy who is the 13 year old son of a out dated movie star. His Father is dead, and his two uncles are dead too. Now he fights to stop another death. Jack [the boy] is thrown into a world with monsters and hatred. Were people he knows are changed and called ""Twinners"". Along the way he meets many people and learns many things. I would say this is a good book for a post-collage or high school level book. It is very long and explains everything in great detail and is a great book. I'm in 7th grade and i had two weeks to read a 800+ page book. You should read this book, but on your own time =]"
4,Don't read much but glad I read this one,Read this book traveling West Coast to East so probably passed Wolf at some point. It was a lot of work at first but once you get the flow of switching back and forth between planes I became addicted. Couldn't wait to find out what happened next and feared how it would end.
1,What were the writers thinking?,"Maybe I read the wrong book but I do not think that an overall mass rating of 4 is representative. Of course there are some aspects of the plot that were interesting such as the wolves or the morphing humans but I kept waiting for a big/important moment to occur as I trudged through this book. I found the latter part of the book extremely comical with the kids using some serious arsenal and the ""fighting"" scenes between Jack and other characters. There are certainly better alternatives out there for fantasy."
3,Jack and the wolf,"The second time I read this book it was much much better (the first time I was quite young). Jack is one of the strongest characters S.K. has developed. However, you seem to be able to tell where Stephens influences were and where they were not. The wolf storyline could have been scaled back somewhat and the Sunshine School and Oatley Tap could have stood some cutting down as well. After all, we were on a journey across the country. Over-all, I rate this book a three (the second time around) because it gives us a character we really care about and is definitely an interesting part of THE GUNSLINGER."
2,Disappointing,"Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature."
2,Not too thrilled. . .,"Captivating story! However, I really couldn't look over the small historical inaccuracies. Never would such sarcasm and outright rebellion have been allowed from a woman! Especially a woman who was an indentured servant in the colonies! Also, small detail, but a woman (especially royalty from London) would not have known how to swim. I did not appreciate the explicit manner in which the author described the character's sexuality. I actually have always picked up Bethany Houses' books with confidence, knowing that they didn't print anything of that manner."
3,The book was lacking,I was enjoying this book but didn't find enough tension between the main characters. One minute she wants him the next minute she doesn't. That's not tension. Then when they finally do come together the author just glosses over their moment. One minute they are getting ready for their honeymoon evening and the next they are waking up in the morning. I would have liked to have some passion. Other than that I did enjoy the story.
4,An enjoyable read,"First of all, I read for pleasure. I don't read to check for historical accuracy, or character development, I read for FUN.I thought the book was entertaining, and I got absorbed in the interactions between the 2 main characters. Of course, it helps that I live in VA, and I've been to Jamestown, so I could picture ""in my mind's eye"" the book as it progressed. The intimacy that grew between Drew and Constance was good - not prudish, but also not too graphic as to offend.I'd definitely look for other books by this author. I snagged this when it was free. Not sure if I'd have purchased @ $9.99 (the going price as I write this), but would have definitely bought at under $5. I also don't recall any glaring formatting errors - but it's been a few days since I finished the book!"
4,Very Enjoyable!,"This book was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoy historical romances, but don't read ""romance"" books because they're always full of sex. This book managed to demonstrate the attraction between the main characters without resorting to the ""throbbing member"" descriptions in other romantic novels. I think the author tries a little late in the story to throw in a Christian message, and I also found some of the dialogue a little cheesy, but overall, this was a good book, and I tore through it in about 2 days. I recommend it."
4,A Read Most Satisfying,"Gist does an excellent job in this novel. The characters are believable and endearing, the history seems accurate and the story is compelling. While I would have liked to see Constance fight a little more for her way, she does a great job of establishing her dominance in the situation. I also liked that Gist was able to take the romance aspect and combine it with the history in a way that wasn't too predictable or corny.Great read, couldn't put it down."
4,A tantalising narrative,"This book provides an excellent narrative of the personalities, the events and the decisions that led to the rise and fall of Long Term Capital Management. As a hedge fund, with its line-up of industry moguls and Nobel Prize Laureates, LTCM was destined for greatness. The colossal fall of this firm, and the ramifications of this on counterparties and world markets was unprecedented and serves as a lesson for all in the finance game. Lowenstein does a great job at reporting the facts in a well-crafted and gripping narrative. Definitely worth a read."
4,a page turner,"I find I get a lot of pleasure when I read about really smart successful people completely failing. It makes me think, as a promising failure myself, that all is ok in the world. Here we have a bunch of masters in the universe locked in a room together with their supercomputers and their supersecret formulas for derivative success lose ONE TRILLION DOLLARS! How dumb is that? A must read for stock market players like myself who don't know what they are doing and yet - I HAVE NEVER LOST A TRILLION DOLLARS."
2,"abundant facts, but lacking coherance","Without a doubt, the author devoted a reasonable amount of time gathering the facts surrounding the birth and demise of Long Term Capital. However, as the author admits himself, many primary sources proved to be difficult beyond a first interview, therefore, it doesn't come as a surprise that the book packs a tremoudous amount of information pertaining to the subject, yet somehow, couldn't tie it all together succinctly. The reader may gain a clearer understanding by reading ""Inventing Money"" by N. Dunbar."
3,Poor Writing,"I'm not a fan of this book. He doesn't really explain what the trades were. He goes over two or three trades in some detail, but not enough for my taste.He also gives people feelings without referencing why or how he knows this. One CEO was in awe of a pivotal meeting, how does he know this (just one example).I was hoping reading this book would give me some insight into the market collapse of 2008, and I get a little info, enough to confirm my suspicions that the 2008 market collapse was in part due to hedging, but not what I was hoping for."
4,Quite a good book but there are better ones on that topic,"This is quite an entertaining book on the failure of LTCM. It is well documented but I think it will be much more appreciated by the outsiders to the realm of Finance.It disappointed me on two accounts:First, it is another one of those typical American business storytelling books where you have to read through bios of the lives of all characters before you ever get to the meat of the subject (e.g. Barbarians at the Gate)Second, the book ""Inventing Money"" by N. Dunbar is in my view a much better account of the LTCM downfall if you have been studying economics and finance as it describes the mechanics a lot more.Nevertheless, the book tells the story quite well and I would highly recommend, by the same author, ""Buffett : The Making of an American Capitalist""."
3,"Hardware is good, software is too much simple","I purchased this hard drive to backup my laptop, planning to use the included software as a tool to do so.Setting up the drive was actually very simple, usage is also very simple. However the backup software is too much simple for my use and I cannot perform the task I wanted.The drive is very silent and runs fast enough for my one year old laptop, with a USB hub in between, I still get from 40 to 80Mb/s transfer rate.Unfortunatelly, I needed more than 4 hours to backup 8Gb of personnal data. And it is not onlyu once, it has to be repeated every time I start a backup, due apparently to some inconsistency between software and windows file properties. So far, I could not perform something satisfactory.I guess with some more time and less data, something reasonable can be worked out, but if you are busy during the day and don't want to mess with time consumming actions, better select a backup software that saves on transfer time, or move to firewire."
1,Terrible stuff...poor scripts...horrible sound track!,Get something else...too old 50ish programming...get the Victory at SEA series or more modern Docs....Just awful...cheap is sometimes just that! Nice graphics on the cover...awful inside!
1,War in the Pacific,Could not review did not receive order. Maybe it's a probem with the US Mail in New Orleans... Not happy. Jerry Cole
5,Urban Social Work,"I have received exactly what I was expecting to receive, actually the book was in better condition than I expect. I got it faster than I was expecting to, which helped me stay on track with my class. Thank you."
3,Sorry Robert Levine...,"How can Robert Levine say that there are 3 new tracks released? Cäcilie by R. Strauss has been released TWICE previously, once on the Strauss cd with orchestral accompaniment and once on the Night Songs cd with piano accompaniment. Releasing only 3 new tracks is bad enough, but please get it right, ONLY TWO TRACKS ARE NEW!"
5,Captivating!,"I was looking for something new to read and read Lee Childs' interview in Playboy, thought I'd give him a try. Purchased Killing Floor and have gotten the next three books also. I'm thoroughly enjoying Jack Reacher looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,A very good maiden effort by Mr. Child,"Jack Reacher is one tough guy. He's Mike Hammer transplanted in the 90's. The only thing he doesn't do is put his heel in the face of his victims to enjoy the crunch of broken teeth and cartilage. The coincidence half way through the story had me worried, but Mr. Child pulled it off. Killing Floor is a decent read and a very good maiden effort by Mr. Child."
4,EXCITING & FAST,"I thought it was exciting and fast paced even tho corny at times. It was related in a very readable point A to point B manner, which I like."
3,"The Stepford Town, the Good Old Boys, and the Loner","A body is found in the antiseptic Georgia town so police do the only thing logical -- arrest the man just off the bus in a rainstorm, there to find out about the blind black blues singer from 60 years ago.There's the state prison, the rich young ruler, the Harvard-educated policeman, a couple of elderly barbers, and the new guy, who, incidentally, is a West-Point graduate recently of the MP's. And a woman cop.Things unpeel onion-wise with questions about how the tiny town on the way to nowhere looks like a movie set, how the first and second men were killed, why an apparent suicide-by-hanging was let go at that, why the young guy had been going to work as usual, eighteen months after he'd been fired from his day job.Break-neck action, slam-bang conclusion, and the only ending reasonably possible.Right there with your Sam Spades and Lew Archer."
1,Price too high,Several friends have recommended this series and I would really like to read it but not at this price. I am supposed to pay $8.99 for an e-book that is over 10 years old? No thanks. Even though I own a Kindle I will go to the used book store and pay a much lower price. The publishers need to get a grip on reality.
1,No plausible plot,"Too much violence. No empathy for characters. Pathetic plot, not believable,just plain silly and not worth killing so many people."
5,Loved it!,This book kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time. It was like watching the movie with all the action scenes and you want to turn your head at times.
4,Cracking read,"Even though he's been around for a long time, Lee Child's Jack Reacher makes his debut appearance in this first Reacher book. Child paints a very visual story, with very real and believable characters. Set in a hot and sticky Georgia town run by a bunch of corrupt heavies. It doesn't take long for the action to start and the bodies to pile up - recommended. S.Rosser - Author TIPPING POINT thriller."
5,What a first novel - WOW!!!,"This book grabbed me and never let go. Each time it seemed like something was resolved or it wasn't getting resolved - BANG - he grabbed you and the momentum simply accelerated again. I've read five or six of his later books and I enjoyed every one, but this one is by far the best one of all. The Jack Reacher character is unusual, but certainly not unique. In this book, however, the situation seems to get more complex as he moves along and each time you think you've figured it all out, well, think again. Lee Child has become one of my favorite authors and if you have any reason to doubt my judgment, read this book and you'll understand why I feel this way. I rate this one as a full TEN."
3,too much detail,There was too much detail in the story. The story was ok. The discription of every little thing was too much and it was not very believable the way Reacher figured out every little thing. Over all I did not care for the book.
2,Predictable and shopworn formula,The story was interesting for a while but it became like most of the other works with a 24 hour time line. The plot was a bit unbelievable and not very innovative. It does hold your interest if you ignore these flaws but it did not make me want to buy other books by Lee Childs.
2,Same o Same o,"Came back to this one having read half a dozen other Reacher novels. So obviously I like them. This strikes me as being the same plot as all the others with slightly different names. I know that if it ain't broke, dont change it but I think Childs needs a fresh frame work."
5,New author for me,"Just introduced to this author, now hooked and reading the serise, just download #4, highly recommended reading. WE all need an hero"
5,HOOKED ON JACK REACHER,"A friend recommended Lee Child so decided to go with the first one with character Jack Reacher. Really liked the suspense, well written and I could actually visualize the characters. Enjoyed the suspense, enjoyed the flow, enjoyed the fact that there were not so many characters that one could get confused. Looking forward to reading the other books."
1,Bloody mess,"If you really enjoy senseless violence without apparent accountability, for the supposed heroes if not the ""bad guys"", read this book. Or imagine marvel comic books without the tongue-in-cheek wit. The plot is juvenile. The carnage is numbing. Bleah!"
3,It's ok,Parts of the book are really exciting. Other parts are pretty ridiculous. Worth reading if you're into thriller books and don't mind if they have a somewhat unbelievable plot-line.
4,entertaining and a quick read,Lee Child's Reacher novels are easy and fun to read. The storylines are a bit predictable but are also entertaining. Killing Floor is definitely one of my favorite Lee Child books.
3,A little too implausible for me,"Over all this is an OK read, but I've read other Lee Child books that were far superior. The circumstances of this book are so implausible that it made it hard to enjoy completely. It does move quickly and the individual characters are enjoyable but the whole thing just didn't hang together for me."
4,"A bit over the top, but a good read.",Since the book was written in the late 1990's when a few were still around I kept waiting for Reacher to jump into a phone booth to changed into his super hero outfit. The plot is interesting and Killing Floor is a fun read.
4,"Top-notch story, but needs some help from a good editor","I really enjoyed the story line, fast-paced, interesting characters, exciting. But, I found myself becoming more and more impatient with the overabundance of ""shrugging"". Everybody shrugged, continually! Will definitely look for other books by this first-time author, but hope in the meantime he finds a good editor to help with the details."
3,Fun book,Great book with some great twists and scenes. A little too long for my taste. Could have shortened by 100 pages or so.
4,Good guys win again!,"As usual, an action packed good guys beat bad guys story. Hey, it might be corny and full of cliches but during these politically correct times, I LOVE IT! More more more!"
3,OK Book,Was looking for something in the line of the Vince Flynn books (Mitch Rapp series). This was not it.
3,A little long,"As noted by others, some of the events require a suspension of disbelief. I almost stopped reading midway through. But having nothing else to read I finished it and found the last half better than the first. I enjoyed the counterfeiting discussions and found the characters interesting."
5,action packed,"Non stop action keeps you interested .Keeps you entertained to the end.Have read others in the series ,now is time to start at the beginning."
1,Total Waste of Time and Money,"What a total load of crap this book was. Here's the two biggest scams in publishing: 1 you don't have enough story to write a 400 page book so you fill pages with descriptions of things that really don't need describing (I loved what another reviewer wrote about using 3 paragraphs to describe a park bench!! LOL! 2 Use two page chapters like Patterson so there are lots of blank pages to fill the book out with. Every other one star review for this book was spot on. Author knows nothing about the military, choppy sentences, thin characters, over the top violence, ridiculous story, and setting a record for the use of the word ""shrugged"" Can't believe this guys name is above the title of the book. Don't understand how any literary minded person could like this book or recommend it. Guess I just have to ""shrug"" and chalk it up to to each his own."
1,Possibly the worst novel ever,"The author obviously doesn't really know what MPs in the Army do. Or what Army service is like in general. The Jack Reacher character, the protagonist!, is COMPLETELY unbelievable. The author doesn't know firearms (revolvers? really? Snub nosed .38? He's kidding us, right?) The love interest story line was silly and adolescent in nature. The entire novel is a joke."
3,Fun quick read!,"The first in the series and the first Jack Reacher novel I read. It is enjoyable enough to read, rather like mind candy. The author tries for some plot twists but they are just curves in the road. I will read another ""Reacher"" novel."
4,First book,Great introduction to an exciting new character. I look forward to reading more of his books. Hopefully the first of many.
5,I like the character and the story lines.,I will be reading more of this series. I want to read the series to date before I see the movie.
1,One of the worst I've read.,"I hate to leave a book unfinished, no matter how lousy it is, and that was the only factor that got me through this one. I was embarrassed reading it, not only for the author, but for all those people on Amazon who gave it 5 stars. The story is strung together with the most unlikely and illogical occurrences. Someone said the author uses ""shrug"" too often. That's nothing. The dialogue is packed with sentences that end in ""..., right?"" or "" ....,OK?"" As one of the prior reviewers pointed out, this is an encouraging book to read if you've always wanted to write but felt you weren't good enough."
3,Written for TV,"Every chapter seems to end with a cliff hanger or key discovery that leads to a commercial break. But a fun read, but heavily reliant on random alignment of coincidence. Still i' is fiction."
2,A paint-by-numbers action novel,"Uncritical readers will find this novel fun and exciting.Discerning readers will see a continuous chain of cliches and implausible events which prevent any suspension of disbelief.Author failed to do adequate research, and thus was unable to convincingly portray the protagonist's background or training. And the author's research into firearms and their use must have consisted of the Wikipedia results of a Google search for ""what is a cool gun?"". My 9-year-old nephew could describe the use of firearms more accurately than the author.I won't be reading any more books by this author, so I will have to live the rest of my life without knowing if the other books in this series are just rewrites of the same book, as Dean Koontz does."
4,"Big book, interesting hero","This was my first book about Jack Reacher. He's a fascinating protagonist. I've already bought another book! Childs' description of action scenes is fantastic. It's terse but vivid - perfect for fight/kill scenes, where everything has to be fast.My only complaint was that my copy of the paperback has a cover image which basically gives away the story (no, not the bloody handprint), and blurbs from other authors that do the same! It's a big book and I'd rather not know what it's about 200 pages ahead!"
3,PART GOOD----PART NOT SO GOOD!!!!,"My first book by Lee Child. It was good enough that I will get another one but it was not great. Jack Reacher is picked up by the police department for murder. He has only been in town a short while and has committed no crime. The story goes from there to finding cops on the take as well as others in the town. I kept thinking Reacher would change into a Superman costume. He can take out as many men as they send and no harm to him. Parts of the book was very unbelieveable. However, part of it could really hold your attention. There was to much detail about the printing of the money, in my openion. All in all a fair read. If you like a lot of action with a super human and all turns out well, this is the book for you."
4,Excellent book,Like all Jack Reacher novels it was suspenseful right to the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes drama and action.
2,Flaws,The thing that really bugged me through out reading this book was how in the world did Reacher get on an airplane to NY and back to ATL without an ID????? I just can't get passed this mistake ...
3,Good overall but not great,Was interested in reading the original Jack Reacher book after seeing the movie and while I thought it was good it didn't have me turning the pages as much as a lot of the David Baldacci books that I have read. It was still a good read but a little easy to figure out and just didn't keep my attention as other books like this that I had read previously.
5,My first Jack Reacher story- looking forward to the rest!,"I'm really glad I started with the first one. Well written, good to great characters, some details a bit too expanded but it does not take away from the story. You can't help but like Jack. He really is more than just a man of action. I look forward to reading them all!"
5,Jack Reacher Series,I read all of the Jack Reacher series a long time ago. I'm now starting over and reading them in order. I love the series! The best I've ever read.
3,Not all that bad for the price,"There are so many recordings of these two Cantatas and all of them (That I have heard) have their merits and detractions. By know means am I sorry that I have this recording, for it boasts some lively interpretations in some of the movements. The most pleasing of the voices is soprano Ingrid Kertesi. Her German pronunciation, for a Hungarian singer is rather commendable. Her downside is that her upper notes are thin and and not developed. Her voice, though, is one of the clearest of numerous recordings. Occasionally, bass Istvan Gati is out of tune.... but hey, that's about it. Not bad, all-in-all. I'd say 3 1/2 stars.... it is a pleasant ""Peasant"" , appropriately caffeinated recording."
2,Do not think it works...,"She drinks it but her teeth do not seem to benefit from it, I see no change in her teeth."
4,Great product!,Our cat had the WORST breath and this product has made it nice to have her on our laps again!
5,Beautiful,"This book was absolutely beautiful and magical. I read this book before I read like Water for Chocolate, so had no expectations, which is perhaps why I seem to like it so much more than people who have read her other books. I loved both Water and Desire, but Desire wins by a long mile. One of the few books I've read that have been honest about relationships but still sweet.If you haven't read Esquivel before, don't be put off by the other reviews, pick up this book and read it! Excelente!"
2,Mildly Entertaining,"For holding such a wonderful gift of communication, Jubilo was weak, and instead of trying to solve his problems with Lucha, he escalated them through lack of communication. I understand that Jubilo's inability to communicate with the woman that he loved was his tragic flaw, but the author did not give me any reason to feel his sorrow and torment. I felt as if the third person narration presented me with a sense of aloofness and an unsympathetic attitude toward the Chi family."
2,Does something smell?,"I wanted a book on ""real"" ghost stories, instead, I got an ode to the author's ego with ghost stories on the fringe. Hans Holzer holds himself up as the One True Authority on ghosts and anyone who doesn't believe him or his pet whack job--oops, I mean ""psychic,"" is to be pitied because they're obviously self-deluded. Their lives are tragically unfulfilled since they don't buy into his ego stroking--um, scientific ghost investigations.All I wanted were some good stories, not a lecture on how I *must* believe because anything Hans says is like unto the word of God. What a waste of my money."
1,Realm of Shadows,"I have read Shannon Drake before, and for the most part I have enjoyed her books. I wish I could say the same for this one. This is a contemporary romance novel set outside of Paris. The setting a small town outside of Paris where two female cousins are worried about their aging grandfather who they think is going off the deep end because he believe in vampires. Sounds good except that it never really goes anywhere. There are many charactors in this book. It would have been nice to know some detail about their lives. Everything is very obscure and no one is really brought to life. The love interest between Tara and Brent is so lukewarm that it's practically none existant. It's hard to believe that this is even a romance novel. It is about as romantic as a TV dinner on a Saturday night."
1,What a waste of money,"I've never read anything by this author before, and I seriously doubt I'll lay out the cash for anything else by her. The characters in this book are very 2 dimensional. The story jumps around giving the reader no time to really get their bearings on what is going on, when, and with who."
4,A review of the record of fossils for children Ages 5 and up,"Fossils tell of long ago is a good book for children. Brightly illustrated pictures help them grasp the facts of fossils. It includes a fun experiment, too, along with a clear explanation of how fossils were made. I give this book four stars."
2,yuck!!!,"is this what bond is coming to, hooks over cheezy beats, i enjoyed the first two albums so much because they actually were playing, and the arrangements were cool. Now, the new songs are weak, the overly produced beats kill the album, and I'm still waiting for killer solos!, as good as the 1st violinist is, you'd think you'd here some awesome solos by now..but nope nothing, if you want beats with some keyboard sounding quartet playing , go ahead and buy this, but i recommend the 1st album, then the second."
1,Disappointed,I started to read andI thought that it was something professionally written. I've been dancing for 15 years and I found tons of mistakes on this poorly written book
2,Bad remakes of really good songs.,"All of the songs on this album are very good. But they are all remakes (by the original artist, slower tempo). To me this is a very bad thing. They are lounge versions of good songs, which is worse, in my opinion, than a bad song. Re-release 5 1/2, EBIS, Pushed Rice, and Komeguny!"
5,Great CD for health,"I love this CD. It is very professional and well done. It brings simple concepts to life in easy to use instructions that have a dramatic impact on stress-relief, relaxation, and over-all health."
4,Return policy great!,"Unfortunately, my gravy boat had a broken handle, but I was able to return it in exchange for a new one. It was in great condition."
4,Very entertaining and accessible Shostakovich,"The conductor knew and worked with Shostakovich, and it shows. Not only that, but the orchestra is up to the task. I'm no great Shostakovich expert, but this is very entertaining.I have read that this symphony is some sort of homage to Stalin right after Stalin's death, a dedicatory of sorts -- to the composer's nemesis?? If that is true, why does Dmitri sneak in the celebratory, almost circus-like passages, that seem as though they were written by a kid just out of school for the summer? Or is it because Conductor Slovak knew that that was how Shostakovich felt -- but he still had to keep such feelings somewhat hidden? Is that why Slovak interprets those trumpet passages that way?In any case, this CD is an excellent value, and a little slice of history to boot!"
1,Heart and Soul by Eva Rutland,"The book is boring, no focus. Where was the excitement in the book, the romance and sex. I did not even believe they where in love and the book was not about one couple but two."
5,About This Book,"Dustjacket blurb:Beginning with the map-making of primitive peoples and ancient Babylonia, the intriguing history is carried through to the late 19th century, each chapter having its own carefully selected bibliography......fresh facts about the lives of the cartographers, with copious details concerning their works and the dates of their publication...To the many enthusiastic collectors of British maps Chapter V, with its generous illustations, will have especial appeal...128 pages, 58 black and white illustrations, cloth over boards with a sewn binding.Table of Contents1.

5,Ol' Max: The First Thousand Years,"Ol' Max is the fascinating life story of a fascinating man, written by an equally fascinating writer. A book well worth reading that shows just what a person can do if they really want to do it. Since I know both Ol' Max and Slim personally, I can vouch for the authenticity of this biography of a man who succeeded against all odds at accomplishing any damn thing he wanted to. I've sat in bars sipping cool ones with Ol' Max and listening to his stories. It was a humbling and heart-warming experience. Read this book. You certainly won't regret it.Robert DyerNovelist"
2,You Expect A Little Proofreading to Help?,"The publisher proclaims ""Now with proofreading"" -- as though correcting a few comma splices is going to make up for shallow characters, mindless gore, and stilted dialogue. If you think ""Natural Born Killers"" is the height of cinematic excellence, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I'd recommend giving it a pass.A grave disappointment."
5,Has become my favorite CD,"This disc contains a wonderful selection of Italian traditional music and opera. No vocals, just instrumental. It has become my favorite disc to listen to when I want calmness and peace. It is soothing music that will lull me to sleep as a passenger on my vanpool to and from work. My only disappointment is that the album does not contain more music."
2,"good, but could have been great...","I read this book while taking a Refugee and Immigrant Perspectives class. In the first third of the book, Pybus presented a historically strong case for her heroine (statistics, archives, interviews, etc.). Then, Pybus begins to profile her own journey - nearly overshadowing her writers' pursuit of Lillian Alling. While I found the final resolution more realistic but slightly less climatic than I had been expecting, Pybus' travels and observations lend themselves to the wild Alaskan frontier and the dangers of walking/driving/living there. Overall, a good read but perhaps should be renamed: The Woman Who Walked to Russia And The Writer Who Drove to Alaska. Now I'm off to read Into The Wild..."
4,Luscious,A luscious read that includes many stereotypes. However the main theme is Sicilian food. The descriptions were so evocative that I was forced to go to the kitchen and prepare a fig and cheese pizza!
2,Not a helpful addition,"I don't write amazon reviews, but given the 5 star rating of the single review, I think a counter-opinion is called for; readers will decide, of course. I taught a recent course on feminism and politics using Lorber as my main theoretical text, but found that its definitions of the different kinds of feminism were analytically muddled. Rather than clarifying differences between Marxist, liberal, postmodern and other feminisms, the descriptions blurred the distinctions and failed to emphasize the ways in which liberal feminism has been challenged on different and sometimes competing grounds by the alternatives. The result may reflect reality--feminism has become an eclectic mix of ideas--but the lack of clarity about how each type emerged and why makes the book less than helpful as a basis on which to build a course. I have great respect for Judith Lorber, but was very frustrated by this book."
5,Awesome white beret,The beret came on time (in fact early!) and it's exactly what I wanted. Thanks so much!
1,Poor quality!,These knifes are awful. Do not waste your money. They are not cheap. I ordered these thinking that they were a nice set to have. They rust in no time!
1,Not as Advertised,"Ordered knife set. Arrived with only 13 instead of 17 pieces. Returned and requested replacement. Replacement set came with right number of items, but different items than advertised. Returned again for refund. One problem with an order is understandable, but two in a row is a joke!"
2,Rusty!,"I bought this because: 1)the brand 2) the price.The first time I received this set, I was really happy, they verry sharp & lightweight.But after a week I used this knives, it start rusty.I really dissapoint with this knives, I gonna return it."
2,Rusty and bent,I got these knives in 2010 with gift certificates from our wedding. They started rusting within 6 months and the steak knives are not very sharp and the tips of them bend without much ease. YOu get what you pay for I guess.
5,great knives,these things are sharp makes my old knives look like crap great kitchen knives and price for this set good enough for me
3,Missing knife sharpner,"I got this as a gift for my mom and the knife sharpener was missing, which was very disappointing. Nice knives, but we were never able to get the missing piece."
3,"Great service, I needed to do more research on the product","Product shipped quickly, but I was expecting a higher quality item. So far, it's holding its edge alright and is working wonderfully in the interim of finding a more permanent set."
1,"Again, wrong knives in the wrong box!","I just received this as a Christmas gift but just got to open it today. The outside box clearly said #15707 but the inside box (containing the knives themselves) was marked #15705 and only contained 12 knives rather than the 17 indicated in the ad. Interesting that it didn't appear that the box had been opened so I think the problem was probably in the initial packaging at the plant. Nevertheless, this is very frustrating. This was a gift from my daughter who ordered it from Amazon and then sent it to me. In order to return it, I now have to ship it back to her who will then have to ship it back to amazon! I am most unhappy!!"
1,All Synergy knives are not the same,"I have had a set of forged Synergy knives for nearly five years & wanted to give a set to my son & his wife for Christmas so I purchased this set thinking they were the same. Before wrapping them, I opened the box & I noticed immediately that these knives are less than half the quality of the forged steel Synergy knives I own. I sent them back & gladly purchased the forged knives for twice the price. These knives were very light weight & did not have any qualify feel. I wish Henckels would not sell two knife sets with the same ""Synergy"" name. I know that some stamped knives are good qualify but these are not."
1,Poor Quality Steel,The stainless steel that these knives are made from is of poor quality. They rust as other reviewers have mentioned. Do you want quality or quantity? Getting 17 knives for ~$90 is not a quality purchase. A single high quality knife made from good stainless steel may cost $90. However there are some good values out there. If I was going to spend $90 for kitchen knives I'd be looking for 2 - 4 knives not 17!
1,Awful!,"Bought this set about 9 months ago and couldn't be more disappointed. The quality is poor, the knives are light and flimsy, and they began rusting almost immediately. Even with minimal use, the knives have dulled to the point that we don't even use them anymore. Not sure how they got the J.A. Henckels name on them, but they are crap and a complete waste of money."
2,I like Henckels...higher end knives.,"Wanted something above the everyday knife, but not as high-end as our $350 set of 7. We liked the expensive Henckels, so figured we would add these to our new stainless decor. After about 4 months, we started to notice rust spots and the rubber grips were pitting, slightly. We do not wash these in the dishwasher; we learned that lesson with a more expensive Soduku knife that was ruined. The micro-serrated blades are good for cutting most meats and vegetables, but aweful for rare/soft meats and cheese. Overall, they aren't terrible knives, just not worth the $70 price tag."
4,Fun read,"I recommend this book. I picked this book up at a used book store (to the author's chagrin), and, even though its a young adult mystery, this 43 year enjoyed it. I read it with my 7 year old son, and his comments are below. As a mystery goes, and as historical fiction, it is quite well done. There are numerous complexities, though contrary to other reviewers, I expect that in a mystery novel. To the author's chagrin, I ordered the sequel from a used book store. My son's comments:Great book. I liked the mystery and the tough characters."
4,Insights from the world's greatest manager,"Jack Welch's style of writing is exactly the same as his style of operating: straight from the gut. A big book, yet no ""lard"", this is a surprisingly easy book to read..I did not expect a book of this size and subject to be as easy to understand as this actually turned out to be. Remember finishing the entire book in a span of just over 24 hours on a journey...If you have heard about GE and the GE way, and have wondered what it's all about, then this book is for you. Go for it!"
3,Ruthlessly Fortunate,"Jack very well incorporated the power of "" selective evolution through periodic removal of the weakest links"". But the big question remains : is that the only way for a company to be successfull?"
1,It's a shame people fall for this - read this,"Jack Welch's pronouncement that ""GE will be a Chinese company by 2000."" still rings in my ears. This orientation leaves several questions in my mind. First, how much of GE's technology was paid for by US taxpayers? And benefited from a favorable business climate in the US? Was Jack's plan to live in the US, run corporate offices here, and move technology and jobs to China? Given this plan, why did GE get 150 billion of TARP money, paid for by our children's debt? Why not ask the Chinese for it? hmmm. (In addition, I am told GE exploited a legal loophole in TARP law so they don't pay it back. Google it if you don't believe me.)Actions speak louder than words, and if this is your idea of ""Winning,"" get another role model, because this pan-handling is my idea of ""Losing."" Granted, this robbery of our children didn't happen during his ascendancy, but it was the house that Jack's leadership built..."
3,Over 239 customer reviews..,"..yet one more won't hurt?!I finally got some time off from travel and got around to finishing Jack's biographyPeppered with anecdotes and `stories' of one of the most charismatic CEOs of his time, the biography makes for an interesting read. Though the narrative and stories are great, they don't really go deep enough. For instance, coverage of GE's globalization or offshoring initiatives in India would perhaps require a book in itself, not a few pages in the book."
5,Interesting to the Ignorant,"In this case the ignorant was me, somehow I had no idea who Jack Welch was or how powerful GE was before reding this book. To me it was an interesting ride being taken from every corne of the company. I had no idea that they owned NBC, I found that very interesting. The book was easy to read, and while I probably only need about 20 year updates on GE I don't regret reading it. Of course he had his ego problem. Somehow he saw Jeryy Seinfeld as the funniest comedian in the world and believed that American has outright choosen Jay Leno as their favorite late night host. I'm sure this book would be much more interesting to someone involved in GE, but it's still a good way to spend a weekend."
3,Business Traveler's delight,"If you spend a lot of time on planes or commutes, this CD is a great opportunity to get an inside look at motivation, success, and the climb to the top. It also makes the time fly by. I would recommend this to any business person.Great job !!"
3,A good enjoyable read,"This book is very well written and does a great job of telling the story behind one of the 20th century's greatest executives. While I don't think anyone (except the author) will agree with all of his decisions, he gives his reasoning and thus it is always possible to see his side. And it's impossible to argue with his results. If you're looking from lessons you can apply, I would recommend Edwin Locke's ""The Prime Movers"" instead."
3,Interesting - but obviously written in a rush,"The book is an amusing read. However, it cannot compare to the great business leader's books, e.g. by Alfred Sloane. It can also not compare to a well written biography (see for example the biography on Ted Turner by Porter Bibb), that would give you numbers and strategy examples of high value. So, don't expect too much. The last third of the book is a real bore - it focuses on justifications for certain not so political correct production methods more than on anything else."
4,Staying competitive... how GE did it,The modern business world is a hyper-competitive environment that moves soooo quickly. Jack Welch gives great insights into what it took to make that elephant that is GE do a tap dance. Great book.
4,A razor's edge between self-confidence and hubris,"About half way through his book, Jack Welch observes that ""there's only a razor's edge between self-confidence and hubris."" He implies that he rarely crosses the line, when, in reality, the unbiased observer is likely to conclude after reading ""Jack"" that he crosses the line frequently. If, however, the reader can tolerate the continuous self-congratulation, there are a great many insights to be gained in this book. (To be fair, diffident people do not accomplish what Welch did.)"
2,A little disappointing,"A name dropper extrodinaire, this book basically returns the ""back scratch""of those who helped him to the top.While I am engaged by his story, and admire the accomplishments, this book is a biography not a teaching tool. The one thing that everyone will come away with is the importance of ""politicing"" in American business.Read it for the story but not for the substance."
3,Good to know more about Mr. Welch way of thinking,"I was recommended this book to improve my way of thinking in the business. After reading it, I have to say that it has fulfilled this purpose. Coming from an engineer background, this book has served to improve my ""business thinking"".However, this book will not make you the new CEO of any company. It just a bunch of success stories and a list of names, and I really was wanting to reach the end after some hundred pages readed. But I really liked the differences between my ""project driven"" mind and that reflected in the book"
5,New Concepts explains it perfectly,"I bought this book mostly for the Directional Movement System. I have been trying to figure out the best way to use this system for some time, and could not get a handle on how to effectively trade with it. I found the explanation of the way the system is constructed to be very helpful. There is not a lot of text explaining how to use the different systems. but,if you understand the concept of what is being measured and how the indicator got there, the rules of applying the system is quite easy. Only time will tell if I am on the right track, but today I feel more confident when making a decision on when to take a position."
1,Shhhh! Please don't tell anyone!,"I was first introduced to this book in 1983. I didn't merely read this book, I absorbed it.I learned that doing the mathematics was only the beginning. With alarming ease, you could actually ""feel"" the market and it's strength or weaknesses long before it was being reported on CNN and CNBC.ADX and DMI are now part of my everyday breathing and eating.I really can't describe how much $$$ it has saved me and how much $$$ I've made from learning about Welles Wilder.But please, let's just keep it a secret amongst friends.Don't tell anyone about this book and if someone asks, you've only heard of Welles Wilder from gypsy fortune tellers and, besides, he was committed to the looney bin years ago.And if anyone is bright enough to suspect you're not quite telling them the truth, just lie!"
5,"Rübsam + Schnitger = Yes, Yes, and again: Yes","The organ used in this recording is the Schnitger in the Martinikerk, Groningen, The Netherlands. For those who know their Schnitger, no more need be said. For those who don't, suffice it to say that one would be hard pressed to find lovelier sounds with which to give voice to Bach's trio sonatas. Rübsam's interpretation is highly articulated, which brings a welcome rhythmic vivacity to the music which goes missing in playing where the almighty legato rules. From the standpoint of tone and sound quality, the recording is pure lusciousness: it sounds like you're standing at the edge of the organ loft. The liner notes give no information about the organ, unfortunately, and no indication of what stops are used in what work. But no matter -- the sound is there, and that's what counts. There is another disc with the other three trio sonatas; if you have the good fortune to come across both at the same time, get out your wallet and count your lucky stars."
1,"It Had Promise, Then Fizzled",This book starts out with a bang. A wonderfully descriptive scene in the emergency room of a big city hospital. But then it turns into a Robin Cook novel. A young medical professional must save the world from the shenanigans of a mad scientist and a corrupt government official. The names and places change but the stories are all pretty much the same. Ho Hum
3,1996 Re-issue of the 1993 compilation,"Just in case you're tempted to get this, it's a re-issue of the 1993 compilation of the same name, but with new artwork. Content is presented chronologically: from the ""Radio Activity"" album (featured are ""Geiger Counter"",""Radioactivity"" and ""Antenna""); from the ""Trans-Europe Express"" album come ""Europe Endless"", ""Showroom Dummies"" and ""Trans-Europe Express"", while ""The Robots"", ""The Model"" and ""The Man-Machine"" are taken from the ""The Man-Machine"" album. All tracks are from the regular North-American releases (not the german ones...)"
5,Simply Strategic Stuff,"Very practical and helpful, I will pull it off my shelf often to review and glean insight. It is full of practical wisdom from practitioners who understand effective ministry. Highly recommended."
4,"Okay, so maybe they're NOT strictly Vivaldi....(doesn't matter)","They're extremely pleasant, and (at the very least) composed by someone influenced by --and attuned to--Vivaldi's chamber music style. Well played and recorded. These are suitable replacements for my old, long-lost recordings of Jean-Pierre Rampal with Robert Veyron-LeCroix."
4,Product Description,"Since Amazon didn't provide a product description, here is the one from the rear cover of the book. POWER OF EVIL-From the days when the Seneca first roamed a virgin continent, the manitous-powerful spirits of the Indian nations-warned of danger. Now the prophecy comes to pass. Voodoo drums beat in the exotic isle of St. Domingue, and the evil has spread to America. A witch's charms and potions lure RENNO's innocent son, LITTLE HAWK. And Renno's beautiful daughter, RENNA, claims her destiny of honor, pride, and courage.POWER OF LOVE-President Thomas Jefferson knows the name and skill of Renno. To this proud sachem now comes a difficult duty: to save the Louisiana Territory for America...and to allow his sweet daughter to follow her heart. As Renno heeds his vision quest to travel a path of battle, Renna must follow her trail of desire and honor-to become a woman who chooses not tears but a totem of love, not surrender but a tomahawk of blood."
1,Disappointed,"I waited for 2 months for these and when they finally got here, they were not what I expected. They are cheaply made - the pattern of sewing is not even straight! They do not block any light, and if you get one snag on the decorative stiching, it unravels faster than you can say 'Oh crap!' which is exactly what this product is."
4,"Fun, Fun",Great costume absolutely stunning. The wings are detachable. Velcro enclosures. My 3 year old is 30 lbs and it is a little big on her. Would fit a slightly larger girl better.
5,Truly and Deepy from the Heart.,"There are points in this book that, as a parent I will admit, made me openly weep and grieve alongwith the author. To suffer such tragedies in so short a span of time, and then to overcome them insuch a way, is truly the heart of inspiration.This is an excellent book of hope."
1,"Only one copy should have been published, for Peart.","I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Rush music and lyrics, but about a third of the way into this book...... it was like hearing a big balloon deflate. PLththththththth! With all the time and lack of responsibility Peart has that your average forty-something year old North American male will never know, it became very hard for me to keep latched to this book. Riding around, scoffing at the very people who made that journey possible. Doesn't sound like healing to me........And then came the letters..... One objective reviewer put it best. Filler. Just takin' up space in th' book. I felt as though I was reading a Dennis Miller dialogue with inside jokes and references that I, or nobody else know about.I guess I picked up this book because I assumed Pearts song writing ability would transfer into a good long read with the power and emotion I've felt from his songs. But it left me wondering who this book was written for and why? Disappointing."
5,Moving is healing,I had a similiar story: When my mom (last parent) died in 07 it took me over 3 months fromn the time of her death to come up from LA and bury her.Afterwards I embarked on a 46 day journey to Canada--I have since used the road as my healer.I am still trying to piece together life post parents.God bless Mr. Peart and his incredible book and for giving us 34 years of incredible music.
4,Ghost Rider review,If you are a rush fan or Motorcylist. This is a good read. I have a new found appreciation for the last few Rush Albums after reading this book.Thank you Neil for sharing.
2,put down the pen and pick up the drumsticks,"It seems to me Neil is trying to hard to be like the sagely authors of the books he reads. It's worth reading if you're a lifelong RUSH fan like me I guess. Just very boring at times. You're a gifted musician, just not a very gifted author."
5,Excellent,Loved every minute of this book! Neil takes you through his darkest times and you are amazed at how he keeps on going. I especially liked his insight on life. Highly recommended.
2,Confusing theme,"A traveling vacation which is a happy event dampened by remorse, tragidy, and personal loss, OR a story of loss and bereavment softened by a trip. Either way, did not care for it and did not finish it after suffering thru about 50%, which is a first for me."
5,"A story of pain, perseverance and victory","This captivating story takes you deep inside the mind and heart of Neil Peart as he struggles to overcome the horrible tragedies of losing first his daughter and then his wife all within one year. Peart is known to be a very private and shy individual despite his enormous popularity, but when he puts pen to paper, he opens up and lets us all inside. I couldn't put it down."
3,A great book if you remove the fluff,"The book is exceptional as it relates the grief process and how one person is able to continue a meaningful life. Be aware that to get to this you must read many pages of a mediocre travel log. The other disappointment is that as much as the book could have been 1/3 of the size, the ending feels rushed."
2,"OKAY,BUT...........................","Okay,this may look like a really cool Skipper doll,but there is one slight problem.....YOU CAN'T GET THE BATHROBE OF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU HAVE TO CUT THE RIBBON OF AND THEN YOU CAN'T TIE THE ROBE!!!!!!!!!!ALTHOUGH IT IS A VERY COOL SKIPPER,I WOULD RECOMEND THE FASHION PARTY TEEN SKIPPER INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"heartwrenching, helpful, but somewhat abrasive","I bought this book after I gave birth to a stillborn son. I was crushed beyond words and was looking for some hope. While I agreed with most of the book and understood the author's point, I do not believe she got at the true heart of God. I believe that God uses all things for good, but he does not bring senseless, horrific suffering into our lives just so we can learn something. For example, I do not believe it was God's purpose, plan, or desire that my baby be stillborn. Also, where does the love, comfort, and ""hope"" come from? More focus could have been put on who God is and how he cares for us and less focus put on us learning an impossible lesson during a time of terrible sorrow."
4,Personalizing the Book of Job,"I walked away from reading this book with much greater insight into the story of Job, many of the revelations connected to my grieving heart, and I have been apt, since initially reading the book, to peruse it periodically to for quotes about Job's story. But I didn't really connect as much to the author and her story."
3,doll for granddaughters,"This doll was purchased as a gift for my granddaughters (along with a wardrobe whiche I'm making now). She seems to be well made, although her hair is quite thin, so I'd recommend keeping it in the ponytails or it will probably get all snarly and nasty. She has a really cute face, and is priced well for those of us that don't want to have to take out a mortgage to buy a gift."
