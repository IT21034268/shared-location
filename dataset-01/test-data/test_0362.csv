4,Excellent buy,"I am no ""professional"", but I like to listen to music in good conditions. I like the quality of the audio. Also, it isolates quite well from ambient noises. And I did not have to pay a preposterous price for a pair of headphones."
5,Great headphones!!!,These are a great set of headphones! The bass is good and musical reproduction is fantastic. They are very comfortable on the head and I really like the one cord coming from the side. I highly recommend them.
5,Favorite headphones ever,I've been using these every day for 7 years. My first pair finally gave out because my cat chewed the cable. $100 for 7 years of high quality audio = $14.29 per year. I've just bought my second pair.
4,got em. like.. almost love em,alright.. my only excuse for not giving these 5 stars is that I dont like the raspy-ness when listening to vocals. it could be because im used to the sony mdr 300's which have lower mid-high frequency range... I might have to give them more time to grow on me because they came in about an 2 hour ago.. Im fine with everything else. has a full sound. I dont like the wiring though because it does that spinning thing you see on old home phones.. but I dont intend to use these outside of my home though so Im not mad at it. actually adds some distance so thats cool.
5,I love these headphones!,"Great (true) sound, very comfortable, and extended cord length. Worth every penny and more."
3,Painfully Good Quality,"The sound quality on these headphones is excellent for the price. I use them at work to listen to music to drown out background noise and help me concentrate. They remain comfortable for longer periods of time than other headphones I have owned.My problem with this product (the reason why I give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5) is that whenever I shift slightly in my seat, or sit up, it shocks the hell out of my ears! I have never had any other headphones do this to me. It really is very painful, to the point where I cringe every time I move while wearing them. I'm sure this is maybe more the seat's fault than the headphones themselves. But I eventually went back to my less comfortable headphones for listing to music at work, and have these hooked up to my digital piano at home (which sounds awesome). Probably a rare problem, but watch out if you have problems with static."
2,Great Headphones... till they break,"I love these headphones. They were great while they lasted. My brother and I both bought them, but they both blew out. I'd spend a few extra bucks and get an updated model if I were buying again."
4,Survival on a distant planet,"This book, chronologically the first in the Darkover series, is more science fiction oriented than the others. It tells a fascinating story of the survivors of a shipwreck on the planet Darkover. The crew faces the problems of dealing with new lifeforms and their effects on humans and meet with the mysterious Ghost Wind, a strange force which affects their emotional states. Very short ( an evening's read) as novels go, it is a good introduction to Bradley, her Darkover series and would serve as a good intro to science fiction in general."
4,The background of humans on Darkover,"Darkover Landfall goes back 2,000 years to the original Terran ship that crashes on Cottman IV (Darkover). Good background book to read before you immerse yourself in the Darkover Universe"
4,rare and ready to go,The pele puma is a good product because its not something evry1 has and they dont sell them in any stores ive been to
4,"light and effective, but not convenient.","Very nice to look at. It does jiggle a bit. You have to take the marker apart to install it. It makes it near impossible to looks down the sights of the marker when you are wearing your mask. In all, you get what you pay for."
3,Juan Rojas,"I thinks its not easy to install, additional if you dont want a heavy gun I wont recomend it, but if you want to convert your custom 98 paintball gun in a nice fusil, go aheadJUan"
2,Not what i expected,"It is a very nice stock, very easy to adjust. The main problem i had with it was the end was too big to fit into the custom 98. I had to drill it down so that the gun would close properly when the stock was inserted. Then again i do get what i paid for."
4,good enough,Only had two problems with this stock when I went to install this stock it wouldn't fit into the two rings. All that needed to be done to fix it was rotate it in the rins of the gun until it was smooth. The next problem I havn't been able to fix. The butt end of the stock is wobbly ands makes noise when it's not up against your body. This is only a problem if your trying to run and be quiet. All in all a good product though.
4,Stock add-on nice buy!,I received my stock very quickly and in great condition. This stock was very easy to install and looks great. I like the positioning options the length extender offers. The butt end of the stock if you only play in a t-shirt is a little rough but you get used to it. Overall a great add-on for a great price. I also saved a bunch of money buying it here than from my local paintball dealer.
5,it rocks,I have a 98 custom act and its perfect for it i don't even have to make the hole for the top spring its already has itit works amazing keeps ya nice and steady and its a plus ya can make it any size ya want cause in paint ball sometime ya must have it short cause your in and small spot it a all around nice stock thanks so much
4,"Pretty Cool, Once Modified to Fit.","I had to modify this a fair amount to get it to fit my original Model 98 (other retailers suggested it was compatible; this is not the case). The end result is a snug fitting stock, but it's not as secure as I'd like (one good bump will knock it out of alignment). I'll probably add an o-ring to keep it in place.The marker looks really cool with the stock. The length of the stock is adjustable and I've found a couple settings that were good for me. I do wish the end had some rubber or foam padding on it; it's a bit hard against the shoulder.I haven't had a chance to fire the marker yet so I can't say how aiming is affected. I'm not sure I'll have an issue though."
4,Tippmann collapsable stock,"This is a good stock. The only problem was that it was a little long and I had to grind it down about a 16th of an inch for it to fit, but now it works fine. It also came with no instructions. The only way to install is to take the whole gun apart and place it in the grooves and then put it back together. Overall, it's a product worth buying."
2,Save your money!!,This stock is a waste of money. I have noticed that over a month worth of play the compression pin that holds the stock to the butt cap is cracking due to stress..I took the stock off and now I just run a remote with harness. Stocks really don't let you sight down the barrel anyways..SAVE YOUR CASH
3,Wind N' Go Camp Lantern,"This product does not give as much light as you might wish for but in case of a power blackout, it would still be welcome. The ability to recharge is the most important thing here."
5,3 hours with a true musician!,"Yes, the audio could be better, yes, the video quality is not A++, yes, Pete wanders at time and yes, you need to download his pdf file. BUT, this is a rare opportunity to sit beside a fine musician and an inquisitive mind! Mr. Sears is obviously not a music teacher, he's a music maker and that's what he's attempting to instill in the viewer. He provided a basic skeleton or structure with the chords, scales, modes, etc., and then he shows you HOW TO MAKE MUSIC! You have to know three things: 1) what to do, 2) how to do it, and then 3) do it. Pete gives you the first two, the third is up to you.I loved his expression, ""let the music breathe"". Make the music your own, don't copy him or anyone else he admonishes. As the Chinese say, "".... teach a man to fish and he'll feed himself for life."" I think he does an admirable job all things given."
3,review of album,"In my opinion- The album is recorded very well . The vocals are soulfull ,excellent style blues delivered with heart . The guitars' tone sounds better than some of his other albums . It has bite . I'd like to hear him really cut loose though ,he's probably capable of much more ."
3,Wheel great look - lock a problem,"This wheel was beautiful and I really wanted to use.The problem is the locking mechanism. It was impossible to lock and then un-lock, even when using a wrench to grip.I wanted to use for under bed application - the wheel would not have had enough clearance to lock, even if the locking mechanism had worked easily.Keep this in mind if planning to use under a flat surface - tight fit for hand or foot to lock, extension under surface may be required.If locking is not an issue, this is a beautiful wheel.I had to switch to a side locking wheel."
5,Panama Canal,My wife and I will be taking a cruise through the canal in a few months and wanted a preview of what to expect. This video is very good and I recommend it for those who will be taking a cruise and also for those who will not but are interested in what it is like.
1,NOT a Biography,"This is a rip-off. $10 for 7 paragraphs that are quotes from other articles.The contents of this document are this:* bibliography of works produced before 2003* bibliography periodical reviews/criticism (7 articles through 1990)* 7 narrative paragraphsIt wouldn't be so bad, if the 7 narrative paragraphs had ANY biographical content. Unfortunately, they have none. The 7 paragraphs simply quote the 7 critical articles and reviews included in the bibliography. There is no biographical information here at all.This is a BIBILOGRAPHIC article and not even a complete one at that."
5,Sunglasses,"Very nice better then expected. Purchased as a gift for my daughter, she loved them I like that it came with 3 pair everyone always misplaces their sunglasses."
4,Aviators,"I gotta give them a 4 because they are such a good deal. I will tell you that these glasses are rather dark. They have good hinges, and none have broke on me yet. They do bend easily though so you have to be somewhat careful. For 15 dollars for 3 pairs i can't really complain though. A good deal."
5,A great value for a great product!,"The sunglasses are an excellent product, considering the price that they are offered. Like other people say they are not completely mirrored, but they are still pretty good. I have a rather big head and they fit me confortably. Highly Recommended!"
5,I love my Aviators!,"Hahahah, sooo funny but for this price u cannot get anything better than them. I like the black one most and others are so nice too. I wanna thank to G&G and also to the reviews who created them. Recommended :-)"
4,Got what I ordered,"These glasses came exactly as I'd hoped they would. They're not flimsy, and I really like the way I look. They also came with a sunglasses pouch, which was nice. I would definitely buy again."
5,Useful examples and detailed discussion,"This book contains a very good discussion of various techniques to analyze data, especially how to cope with errors and noise in the data. Many examples fill the pages of the book, giving ample opportunity to try out the concepts discussed in each chapter. De Levie's writing style is easy to understand, candid, and seasoned with humor.In addition to addressing data analysis techniques, de Levie includes a thorough examination of macros and how to write them, as well as instructions for utilizing the freely available MacroBundle and other add-ins that he and others have written to augment the functionality of Excel."
3,Decent glasses,Bought these to use riding at night in good weather. Not for adverse weather unless you have a full face helmet. Work well for what I bought them for though.
2,I AM NOT ON BOARD,"I seem to be the one person missing the boat on YEARS OF METEORS. I found that for the most part the songs were forgettable and monotone. Now realizing that all, I guess all, the other reviewers love this CD, maybe its me. I just find so many other singers head and shoulders above Laura Viers, at least on this CD."
4,Handy,"This is really handy to hold down small loads, has a lot of stretch and the hooks are solid so they won't bend."
5,good watch,"This model of Timex watch is excellent. It looks good, works efficiently, bright indiglo light. Basically, it is an excellent choice if you need to know time, would look good on your arm and invest around $30-40."
2,not at all as pictured,"this watch although it looks sturdy and like a great watch, I bought it because of the way it looked in the picture. The strap looks like it is all black with brown stitching. It is not, it is black in the middle and cocoa brown on the leather. the face of the watch looks like it is black too. It is not. Some of the reviews said that the face was grey. I would have been happy with grey. It is not black or grey it is a kaki green. I am very dissapointed. I bought it for a valentines gift because my boyfriend likes black much more than he likes brown. But unfortunatley I don't have time to return it so he will just have to be happy with this one. But the seller really ought to change the picture. It is false adverting."
5,Great!,The recipes are wonderful. We highly recommend this book to our meat customers because the recipes are always delicious and the information about how to cook with grass-fed meats is indispensable!!!
1,this product sucks,The fan has a safety lock to be sure the cage is in place. The lock does not fit and I had to find a way to over ride the lock out.It also is noisy with a tiney vibration while even at low speed.I can not recomend this product to anyone.
3,"Very Strong,Sturdy and Attractive Fan.........","This Hunter Century model fan is all one could ever need in a higher priced fan. it oscillates,has low medium and high settings. It is very nicely put together. its very rigid and strong feeling. on the heavy side. the base of it makes it heavy. the fan in my opinion IS NOT LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it moves air nicely. it arrives needing assembly. took me about 20 minutes. very easy. Just a quick note,,,i did mention that it moves air nicely. I have noticed that it really does'nt. On the low setting it is very weak,. it seems you have to be right on top of it to feel it. higher setting is slightly better. Not sure if id recommend this fan at this price. it does look nice though."
2,Diminished Expectations,"I've had Hunter fans in the past and found their quality control was much better than with this product. The vertical shaft is not vertical,and cannot be adjusted without using home-made shims. The fan blade is out of balance causing the upper unit to vibrate. The Hunter customer service staff informed me that I would have to disassemble, re-pack, and return the unit for examination. ""They do not carry replacement parts."" The warranty is meaningless unless you are willing to spend the time doing what they require as described above.I replaced the metal blade with a 30 year old WalMart plastic blade which resulted in less noise and more air movement.The air movement noise others have complained about is due to poor design of the blades."
3,"Robes fall in floor... Too short, needs curve ...","Agreed that brushed nickel is beautiful ... This company's items are heavy-duty and will stand up to a lifetime of 'hanging around'... (pun intended).... I bought this ""hang-up-double-bar"" at same time as the vertical TP holder.... Well, the ""hook"" was a let down for only one reason, the ""T"" shape.... mounted ""T"", bar is too straight to keep two items hung up.... I finally mounted it the sideways direction to keep a robe on.... looks more like a straight line ""l"" now .... works great that way, but now I need another actual hook, for the second robe... If it had a curve to hold the garment on the bar, it would work... but... too short... I plan to buy another hook in brushed nickel, but more of a ""J"" or a double ""JJ"""
5,End of the Books of the North,"Glen Cook's ""Black Company"" certainly isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy unusual characters who are not so much ""heroes"" as they are the ""lesser"" of two evils, then this is the series for you.There are times when his writing gets a little complicated, and it can be hard to follow, but you can forgive this flaw because the story and the characters are unique and engrossing. Highly recommended for fans of noir fiction, Roger Zelazney, dark humor, or Steven Brust.You won't want to read this book if you haven't read the two previous to it. You *can*, but you won't want to -- you'll simply miss too much. This concludes the first three books in a very satisfying ending. No, these aren't ""deep"" books -- but they are original and refreshing. Glen Cook is a thumb to the eye of the typical square-jawed hero, and a welcome one at that!"
5,Got this book for my son,My 10 year old son loved this book. He is a big sports fan and was inspired. I highly recommend it.
4,What a deal!,"Picked one up because Office Max had it for $60. WHAT A DEAL! Easy setup (make sure you use the Vista install disk if your computer is a Vista OS). No USB cable like all other makes so you use one if you have or buy a cheap one. It also has a parallel port but I don't know who or why one would use it (except if you have a really OLD computer). Good print quality, fairly fast but kinda loud on warmup and printing (hey it's only $60). I read where many posters are complaining about jams. I haven't experienced this yet but i have seen it on other laser and it is ALMOST ALWAYS a result of using cheap, thin, paper. Under no circumstances should you use paper made from recycled materials and do not use paper less than 22 lb. weight (unless you want the agravation of poor quality prints and jams). The other BIG plus is that you can pick up replacement toners for under $40 which is a deal compared to most inkjet printers."
1,Paper does not feed usually,"I've had this for months, and it will not print unless one pushed the paper in a sheet at a time. It tries to pull the paper in, fails, then signals a jam. If one opens/closes the front cover it'll try again after 10 seconds of whirring--this give you enough time to get your fingers under the next sheet of paper so you can push it in manually. If you don't it'll usually get the paper after 2 additional tries (ie it fails, you open/close the cover it tries again).It's quick, IF it's not in powersave mode (it almost always is unless you're printing out a batch of stuff. It's output is fine. But I cannot tolerate a printer that must be babysat--worse because it's shared on my network and I'm usually nowhere it."
1,Potential Hazard,"This thing does consume an extreme amount of current even when it's not in use. I thought that there was faulty electrical wiring in my house after the lights started flicking (for about 2 seconds at regular five minute intervals), until I read Patrick Jordan's review and seen that he had the same problem. Then I immediately knew that it was the printer. I switched it off and the flickering lights stopped. Seems like this could be a potentially hazardous item. I'm still in shock that someone else experienced this and am starting to wonder if it should be pulled from the market."
2,jams,"This printer worked great for the first few months. Now it will print a page or two then stops. Open and close the front cover, it tries again, moves the top sheet a half inch, and stops. Will have to buy another printer."
1,Bad Paper Feed,I was happy for the first week until the printer stopped taking my envelopes for printing. I was just getting used to not doing it by hand! Just after I finished my first toner cartridge It stopped feeding the paper and would give me a loud electronic noise. If I take the whole thing apart and turn it off then reassemble it and make sure the paper tray is FULL then it will work a while before breaking again. Needless to say I'm disappointed.
1,Broken,"Printer is still in warranty...thank goodness. It has been in the shop twice over the last month. The first time for the part that senses the paper. The technician has to call Samsung and find out what is wrong and order the right part the second time around. Until this time, have been very happy in terms of everyday use. But clearly this is cheaply an poorly built and would not recommend it. This is the last Samsung printer I intend to buy. Also...the manual feed for single sheets and envelopes doesn't work the best. Paper doesn't always go in straight."
2,paper feeding problems,"Like some others, I've been experiencing paper feeding problems with this printer that I got less than 1 year ago. It somehow doesn't pickup paper consistently anymore. I usually need to open/close the front cover on the printer 10+ times to get it retry and pickup a single sheet of paper.It prints fine when it's able to pickup the paper. But due to the paper feeding problems which a lot of people seem to be experiencing, I wouldn't recommend this printer. Doesn't seem to be reliable in this aspect."
1,Does Not Deserve One Start,"Bought it because needed a printer fast and this was on sale. Should be renamed the ""PJ-2510"" - for ""PAPER JAM - 2510"". Also, environmentally (if you care about recycling toner cartridges), Samsung does NOT accept back the used cartridges. And for a long time, even the brick & mortar stores would not accept them. Quality is reasonable. ALWAYS KNOWS WHEN YOU HAVE AN URGENT PRINT JOB - NEVER FAILS TO JAM AT THAT TIME. Amazon is great - this printer is not.Samsung ML-2510 Monochrome Compact Personal Laser PrinterAlso, cannot vouch for life of toner cartridge."
2,"Good printing, dims the lights (!!), makes me nervous","This is the third printer I've had in this series, after the 1810 and the ML-2010. When the ML-2010 was old, and for this new ML-2510, whenever I turn it on or print, the printer kicks off a power surge sufficient to dim the lights and trigger the alarm on the battery backup/surge protector. This can't be good for my electronics. Except for that one wacky feature, all these have been clean, fast, bullet-proof inexpensive B&W laser printers."
4,Nice and cheap laser printer just not idea for heavy use.,"This printer is not design for heavy or even medium use, if you printer like more than 10 pages straight, the printer might not able to print again for hours in order to cool off, since paying only like $40 i am not comaplain, to print few pages is as fast as those laser printer cost 10 times more. is not big and doesn't take that much space, not many parts moving."
2,Constant Paper Jams,"It was good for about the first 100 sheets of paper. After that, the printer jammed constantly on the average 9/10. When I print, the printer pulls in the paper about 1/4 of the way and then it stops and the red light comes on. I have to pull the paper back and open and close the entry to the toner so it will reset. I have to repeat this several times until finally it would print successfully. The only reason, I still want to make this work is because I recently bought a replacement toner cartridge.I notice that the paper feed rubber under the toner is very dry and cracked. This could be the reason why it is not feeding the paper completely all the way.Samsung should do something to address this problem but apparently they have not in spite of all the reports of this printer's jamming problems."
3,Ace rules!,"This EP was an extra dose of Ace's 'Frehley's Comet' that showed his former bandmates who's boss!However, if you're about to put the money down for some live Ace, look for '12 picks' which contains a big chunk of live songs from a concert in England. In fact, those recordings are from the Live+4 concert video (a great piece if you can find one) released at the same time as this EP. There's also live Ace on 'Loaded Deck.'This EP starts off great with two strong tunes, then meanders off into a ridiculously long drum solo from Anton Fig...as if anyone who bought an Ace Frehley album really wanted to hear a drum solo, let alone one from the guy in David Letterman's TV show band! Where's the Ace solo? Still, the band is tight and Ace plays his ass off. A good listen, if you don't mind skipping through the drum solo! If it was Peter Criss or Eric Carr a drum solo would've been cool but the guy from the 'Late Show,' I don't think so!"
4,good book,Got this book to help me with my course at work. It helped and was easy to use. Would recommend.
4,I really like the quiz cards for review in the back of the book,"The course I took did not follow the book, but I think this is pretty helpful, especially the perforated flash cards included in the back. From an ICU nurse."
3,Rudimentary workbook,"This is a good book for those that already have some knowledge about ECGs...if you are new to them, I would suggest finding another book to help."
3,KetoChlor Shampoo,"This stuff works pretty well, but you have to use a lot of it and often, so it seems silly to have it in 8 oz bottles. Probably ok for a small dog, but iffy for a GSD!"
2,Romanticism on the harpsichord,"I may be blinkered by the recordings of the Well-Tempered Clavier I grew up with, but Moroney's interpretation leaves me cold. I am not at all opposed to transcriptions and arrangements of WTC, and I honestly don't know how Bach would have played it himself; but this is the harpsichord, not the piano; and these pieces are weakened (if that were possible) by Moroney's Romantic interpretation. The notes speak for themselves, but Moroney often seems to want to either say something different, or add needless emphasis. I like my tea with one sugar, not three, thank you.As a resource it's quite valuable (small mistakes aside): but I would look elsewhere for a satisfying performance."
5,easy to push,I mounted these wheels on a frame for my table saw. They work great and the locking device is easy to push down.
2,bad choice,"We also did the research and thought this was the best from all reviews read. I bought it in january and it worked for a couple of weeks and then died work--screen froze. amazon sent a replacement. it worked for well for two months (except we couldn't download tv shows recorded on our PC in Media Center XP), then screen froze and it would only turn on if plugged into the ac adapter. By this time, we had to return it to Toshiba. When we got it back, it was not fixed. Just sent it back to toshiba again. we'll see. It's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work."
1,TRASH,I bought mine for $200 but even that was overpriced when you consider that it only worked for around 6 months. One day it just froze for no reason and all my songs disappered only to reappear a few days later. Now the unit only works is if it's plugged in which renders it pretty much usless. Don't buy this piece of trash. Now I'll just have to break down and buy an iPod.
4,Fantastic Portable Media Center!,"Toshiba have managed to produce an excellent portable media player that offers a massive specification over rivals. If you have an interest in Windows Media Center 2005/Vista Ultimate/XBOX 360 then this is the product for you as it is fully compatible with all and offers synchronisation of music, pictures, recorded TV and video. The display is very bright and clear and the sound quality from the head phones is great. This product would have got five stars if the USB connector was better and if it shipped with a protective case! Wonder what the Zune will be based on??"
4,Great Choice for music and photos,"I purchased this 3 months ago and have had excellent results. The battery life isn't as good as advertised but overall, the product is excellent. I use it with Napster To Go and for downloading pictures off of my camera. I especially like the fact that I can download pictures and use as a temporary storage device without having to go through a computer. The built in radio is also very nice. I gave it only 4 stars because of the battery life but would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,Had to return It,"The switch from ipod to this came only because my ipod broke. I wanted to try something new and I heard this was good. I was wrong. I used it for one day and it broke my computer. I installed the update to media player and it corrupted my system. So I reinstalled windows and tried installing this again, same thing happened. I did like the screen and the whole set up of the item, but the software needs some major help. I think Microsoft needs some help with there coding and Toshiba should make there own transfer software so this problem wont happened to anyone else. So far I have found nothing that compares to the ipod, so if you need a new mp3 player wait for the next gen ipod and I think you will have a better experience."
4,"The PMP is perfect, it's the rest that can be improved","4.5 stars:Nice, sleek design. Nice interface. Versatile. Superb sound quality (no need to use EQ). Newsworthy alternative to the bad-looking I-Pod and Zen Vision:M.3 starsWhat could be improved:1) What's the point in having a port when there's no docking station available? Gigabeat was out on 2006...time to think about it, Toshiba!2) WMP sucks! Only Mp3-Tag-info file management it's no great idea. No way to use other software to use device interface properly (annoying for already existing MP3 on PC)3) With a more powerful battery it could last longer: waiting for 3rd-party ones...I hope there will be firmware releases in the (immediate) future, just to add new features: Gigabeat is now underexploitedI keep on waiting patiently...A great buy! (half the original via Electronica Direct - and I live in Europe, where it not available)"
2,The gigabeat S is just a prototype for zune,"This is a good product, the only thing is that it will delete all the stuff that's on it even if you look at it funny. I have had it delete my all my music and videos and pictures on it that took hours to put on in an instant. And what's worse is it happened more than once, 7 times is to many. So in the end would i recommend this product. To someone I don't like yes. Otherwise I highly recommend getting a microsoft zune. And it is just a really really bad prototype for the microsoft zune anyway, trust me I sold this player and bought a zune. The interface is the same, bigger screen, more color variety. What do you have to lose with the zune, memory? If that is the case you can just wait until the zune 2.0 comes out later this year."
1,Diga No A La Pirateria,"First of all, this cd is all fake! This cd is not live! Fans of Chalino, don't be fooled! The only ""real live"" albums are: En Vivo desde El Farallon, and En Vivo en El Parral.... That's it! This Album is garbage!"
2,Not a good car for younger kids,Wheels do not work on the car my son was so upset it sucked and he lost the race because the car stopped and would not move and more
4,"Good shorts, crotch/butt pad uncomfortable","These are great shorts, especially for young athletes. I bought them for my son and his only complaint was the butt/crotch pad. It bothered him so much that we removed it."
1,Save your money/time.,"Bought this for use on a camper.Cheap so I can't complain about that but it is totally worthless.Didn't pick up a single channel. Ended up spending $ 40 on an antenna called the Tune Trapper,now I'm picking up channels a hundred miles away."
3,Reception is fine but hardware is rusting.,"My assumption was that a marine antenna would come with with marine hardware. After just 3 trips in the salt water, the screw at the base of the antenna is coated in rust. Doesn't effect signal or anything but is a little unsightly. Don't buy if you want it on a boat!"
4,Does the trick for a great price,"Bought this for my boat and newly installed stereo. As others have said, the bolt you use to mount it should be longer for campers, boats, and there are no installation instructions but you have to be an idiot not to be able to figure it out.....the antenna on the outside and the wire part on the inside.... besides that, it seems to work just fine. I know it makes reception better on my boat...without it I got nothing but static."
3,Nice block but slots too narrow,"I recently bought a Kramer knife that is 2 3/8"" wide at the handle. I was hoping, partly based on the reviews, that this block would accommodate it -- in addition to my cleaver. No such luck -- the slots other than the cleaver slot are only about 2 1/8"" wide. If your knives fit in this dimension, it's a very nice block, but I wish the descriptions would give the slot widths."
4,Swimmingly Wonderful,"Glynis Johns shines as the determined and romantic mermaid in this jewel of post-war British comedy. What the film lacks in production values it more than makes up for with the acting of the cast, notably Dame Margaret Rutherford as Miranda's devoted and delightfully daffy nurse. The film presents a satirical take on the British class system as Miranda enchants and manipulates men from all classes of society. An interesting note, David Tomlinson, who plays the enraptured chauffer, later starred as Johns' husband in Disney's Mary Poppins. A sign of things to come, as soon as Glynis Johns Miranda changes scenes from water to land her hair is luxuriously coiffed and curled automatically, much like Daryl Hannah's Madison in Spalsh! It must be the salt water that does this... Watch for the scene at the seal pond at the London Zoo. A classic."
5,Supremely Witty!,"This book is a gem! Maddy Hunter has found the perfect balance between true mystery and humor. I was constantly having to stop reading because I was laughing so hard! The story is a page turner - in fact, you might want to read it on a weekend or day you don't have to go to work, because you won't want to put it down. I can't wait for another Maddy Hunter installment!"
5,PLEASE DISCOVER THIS BAND!,"Pure latin pop rock! There is no ""packaging"" envolved, check this band out and tell others.... I loved it!"
4,Found Grace,"When Cornelia is in ninth grade, her mother leaves her with her Great-Aunt Agatha and takes off with her boyfriend. Cornelia and Agatha are vastly different, with the teenager being a shy bookworm with a stutter and the older woman being a very folksy, country lady. Though it is blood that binds them, it is ultimately literacy that bonds them.This book is short and sweet, poignant and poetic. It is easy enough for reluctant readers and important enough to discuss with kids and adults alike. As mentioned earlier, it encourages and emphasizes the importance of literacy.Highly recommended. Well-written characters and powerful themes."
1,"Bad quality, very disappointed, waste of money","This shoe looks quite different and nice but it's quality left a lot to be desire. I had only worn the shoe a few times and the shoe tear at the side where the upper part meets the sole. I didn't do anything to stress or test the strength of the material and yet i noticed the tear which is almost 2 inches. I had to stop wearing the shoe and because the material is thin, i didn't even think of getting it repaired. Very disappointed."
4,Brother Jack keeps on keepin' on...,"This one is yet another in a series of great, 'tight' McDuff recordings, with the REAL sound, again. Houston Person is back, playing as well as producing, and the sound is all there. Randy Johnston (who I am partial to), and John Hart share the guitar on alternating tracks - you won't have trouble with 'who's who' anyway - and Cecil Brooks III alternates with Buddy Williams on the drum chores (bad choice of word - pleasure is more like it). Some blues, some ballads, and a few REAL burners: ""Rock Candy"" is back for an encore here, and if you don't jump to it, start planning for REAL retirement. ""Off The Beaten Path"" is another stand-out burner with the Bridgewaters playing sax and trumpet, respectively. Yep, Another Good 'Un. Recorded in 1999."
4,Sante and Kenneth Kimes comes alive,"This was an excellent book on the would-be drifters who became killers. Easy to read with good historical background to the Kimes family, which had its own group of bandits from the 1920s and beyond.Mike Koch, author of ""The Kimes Gang."""
1,yawn!,"I would like to echo the thoughts of the other reviewer on this CD.Amongst my various didg CD's I don't have any other Mark Atkins, so I have to be fair and assume that he is a very able musician but this truly is THE worst album of its kind.I am an improving didgeridoo player, and frequenlty buy this type of CD as a source of reference, to get ideas for new rhythms, techniques and playing styles etc and thus, this was why I bought this album.If any one else is considering purchasing this album for the same reason.....DON'T!!!! You will learn absolutely nothing. I thought sometimes my playing was going round in circles and achieving nothing......I was wrong!!!"
4,Satisfactory,I didnt get the jacket in the color I ordered but they notified me and asked if it was okay to send the color that was available. The jacket works fine so I'm satisfied.
2,Just nothing good about it.,The stars are young and the acting younger. This is just a low budget bad movie. If this movie is close to the truth of a action that took place in WWII - we kill our own? These guys were special forces? Can the Japanese be any more stupid. I see nothing good to say about this movie.
5,Excellent Notebook,"Setup was very easy. The display is crystal clear and the sound is awesome (it's got Altec Lansing speakers built in). Was stuck between this and the Toshiba S301, but finally opted for this because of higher memory (512 MB DDR SDRAM Vs Toshiba's 256 MB SDRAM), better software, easy navigation keys and light weight. This one got more points for the looks as well. It does not get heated that much and the fan is very quiet. The higher memory has a clear advantage when running multiple applications (browsing + watching a movie)."
5,Original. Funny. What more do you want?,"This is the bomb squad of all new TV shows. Three years running as my favorite podcast and then the foray into TV. Is it an instant classic? Probably not. Does it deserve a chance to breathe and grow? Of course! It is what it is and that is quite funny and original. Not every improvised bit can be a winner, but isn't that the point? It is so refreshing to have fun new things each time you see/hear this show/podcast."
1,Mad,"who knows how this product is the company ""custom"" took 2 weeks to send it out and than i never received it. And they never offered to send it again. so i took a refund this was a bad company and i figured i better get my money back as fast as i can."
4,Good read but predictable,"There was not too much new in this novel, it was rather predictable. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good read. I did enjoy the banter between the hero and heroine. Mary was monumentally annoying in her stubborn attitude but the author still made me want to see her happy. Our hero, Tye, was so handsome, studly and perfect it was difficult to see why the heroine didn't just fall for him right away like I did. But she did have her reasons.This was a good introduction to an author that is new to me. I intend to read more by Cathy Maxwell."
1,The Most Romantic Melodies of All Time...,"...become the most irritating elevator pablum ever concieved. Perfect for Stepfords everywhere! Not music, but a powerful central nervous system depressant that may cause permanent organic brain damage! Not Music! Avoid!"
4,GOOD MONITOR,"THE SCEPTRE XG7 17"" MONITOR WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A 5 STAR BUT THE SPEAKERS ARENT VERY GOOD.THEY ARE KINDA SMALL BUT I EXPECTED BETTER SOUND."
2,The stars are only for Rebeca and the story,"Come on! I can't believe that the Mr. below said that this is the basis for all the beauty and the beast features! You must see the Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the beast, wich is truly a great film, and the inspiring of all other good versions (Faery tale theatre of Shelley Duvall, with Klaus Kinsky as the beast, and Roger Vadim as director), and the crap versions (this one, disneys). This one is boring, low paced, and a bad copy. The only thing of this film is the beauty. But i prefer to see her in the movie with Michael Fox."
1,capitalists,"after all the commercialization of it, with the video tapes, shirts, hats, magnets, etc..etc.. it has gotten quite old. I believe the creators of south park are just capitalist pigs just like the poloticians and the corperate guys, what we dont know keeps the contracts alive, dont fall into the capitalist BS, anarchy forever... END"
1,"Oh God, not more","I got this one for my birthday from a friend who thought I liked the show. The ""Elephant..."" episode had me crying it was so poor. ""Death"" was actually fairly mediocre, especially when Granpa kept calling Stan ""Billy"". Apart from that more attempted vulgarity trying to be accepted as ""shock comedy""."
4,Hot Comedy with plenty of Laughs!,"Gory twisted and now somewhat predictable, seeing it again after almost 20 years it's really funny. And so scary you know it's just a total fake.....great viewing for the kids under 12 fantastic!"
3,so very close to 4 stars,"this is as creepy as it gets.this is on the level of evil dead without the blood splatter and with a higher body count.its a briliant twist on the zombie/walking dead genre.a sleepy little towm on the outskirts of nowhere is the setting.and its inhabitants have something very wrong with them.im very pleased that this was transfered.since its an early 80s movie,the VSH version is very grainy/cloudy and id like to see it the way it was intended.get this movie,you wont be regretting it.now,the wait for 3 oclock high,last exit to brooklyn,year of the dragon,wierd science,after hours,missing in action pt.2,the raiders and star wars trilogies should continue."
3,Blue Underground should be ashamed,"One would expect that if a DVD release is adding not one, but three different audio commentary tracks they would have the decency to make the dialoge available via subtitles or close captioning. They didn't!It's a ""Limited Edition"" alright, limited to only the non hearing impaired."
2,what zombies?,"the front of this box certainly does look scary but it is far from being a zombie film!people are ""re-animated"" so to speak and cycled back into town life.i didnt find much scary about this film. i wanted to see it as a kid but never mustered up the nerve to sneek into the theater so i bought it.i like gory speacial fx's and stan winston but.....i found the movie slow and somewhat convaluted. there was not enough gore or horror and figuring out the end was not hard to do.much of what is being re-released on dvd these days is infact for the die hard fans and this ones for those who are into the cult classics from the past.if its zombies you want chew on some g.romero or lucio fulci."
3,pretty good,"another reviewer was right- apparently, lemons cure a lot of things. this book is pretty good and an entertaining read, but i don't think it will take the world by storm."
5,Priceless,"We all must learn how to care for ourselves without drugs and allow our body to heal naturally. It will if you give it a chance, it knows what it is suppose to doMikhail Tombak books will allow the pro active reader to understand how to care for themselves without the added toxicity that medical chemicals cause that deposit themselves in the liver.Read Read Read"
2,Hoo Hum !!!,"It was OK nothing special within, I would not suggest to spend the bucks. This guy seems to like lemons alot for all kinds of cures,,,, I would pass if i were you."
3,"It's No ""Never Mind the Bollocks""","This one's for true fans of the Sex Pistols only. While it's a treat to hear some of the raw footage of the band's first-ever recording, the sound quality is less than professional, and the band lacks the energy found in ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols"" and later recordings. The only true gems on this album are the '76 demo versions of ""Anarchy in the UK"" and ""Pretty Vacant"" and their cover of the Iggy Pop classic ""No Fun,"" which was also recorded in '76.Aside from that, stick to never minding the bollocks when it comes to the Sex Pistols. Your ears and your wallet will thank you."
3,Is this really the last in the series?,"The ending of this book is rather sloppy if it really is the last in the Dragon Nimbus series. It left a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions. Like, does Mikka get to have her babies? Does Miranda return to her country to help it rebuild? Are the laws against magic repealed? Too many loose endings to be the end of the series.It was also a rather abrupt ending. I had to check to make sure someone didn't rip the last few pages out. So while I enjoyed the story and writing, I did not think this was the best of Radford's writing. It really just seemed like she got tired of writing and gave up.It would be nice if Radford made another book answering these questions and tidying up the loose ends. Otherwise, I find this to be a very unsatisfactory series end."
3,Disappointed!,"I found this book to be a big disapointment. To be honest, I found the other books in the series were o.k., not great but not bad. The author's use of magic is all over the place with no rhyme or reason. Her more interesting characters, Brevelan, Jaylor, Rejiia, et al. are either just mentioned or are relegated to cameo roles. The two magicians in the book took forever to figure out how to break the spell...I knew how within the first page or two. She should have wrapped up the series with the Lonliest Magician."
5,ALLAHU AKBAR!!,"Jeffrey Lang has ingeniously expressed the essence of the convert's experience. I wept tears of joy at having discovered that my feelings, difficulties, and apprehensions were not unique. I especially liked how Jeffrey Lang warns against some of the common pitfalls of converts. He is a remarkable author that is quite sensitive and candid."
3,"a great little single to have, especially for the true fan","This import came from an Australian tour in support of the Pablo Honey album. It's a great buy for the big Radiohead fan. It includes Anyone Can Play guitar, and Creep from the Pablo album and three other b-sides. A fast version of the song Thinking About You from Pablo which will make you see Radiohead's roots in punk. A live versian of the song Killer Cars, and a rare b-side called Pop Is Dead. This is worth the buy just for the three unreleased b-sides. Get it!"
3,I could have planned a good party without it...,"I read this book from cover to cover. I didn't gain anything from reading it. Save you money and don't buy this book.I also bought The Ultimate Bridal Shower Idea Book: How To Have A Fun, Fabulous, and Memorable Party. THAT book was really good."
3,Worst Cliff Hanger -EVER-,"I saw this movie on TV one night and LOVED it! I searched every where for it on DVD and the only place I found it was on Amazon. It shipped quickly and although you can tell it was some kind of bootleg or burned from somewhere (which is expected for movies this old and generally unheard of), quality wasn't an issue. It's a black and white movie so it's understandably a bit grainy, but here's the kicker...IT WOULDN'T PLAY THE LAST 2 MINUTES!Anyone who has seen this movie knows how important these few minutes are and for them to be missing, or scratched off was definitely a deal breaker."
2,"Great flashlight, but corroded internally","I bought one of these awhile back and had the batteries totally corrode, sealing themselves inside. I had both the 3-AA Maglite and a 3-AA Streamlight Twintask, and they both did the same thing. I have numerous other 2-AA flashlights and have never had a problem with them, even for the last 10 years. But with the 3-AA model, the batteries corroded within probably 6 months or so. In fact with both my Maglite and Streamlight, I kept them only indoors, one at work and one at home, one used Energizers, one used Duracells, and yet they both did the same thing. So after spending a bunch of money, I was pretty disappointed, and am hesitant to buy a 3-AA model again. Anyone else out there had a problem with the batteries corroding? I loved this flashlight, but not sure if I should spend the money again."
1,Item does not work!!!,"Hello, Recieved itemBut was not in workingcondition & so farno one can find the partsto fix it So just went downto local Hardware store& for a few extra dollarsbought a new one that doeswork. After paying for productplus shipping it is morecost effective to get somethinglocal from someone youcan deal with in personThanks, Dale"
3,Not the newest maglite model,"It was not clearly stated in the item description but this flashlight model(the 3-cell AA) is no longer manufactured. I got the flashlight and fortunately realized this before I opened the packaging so I returned it for the Maglite 2-cell AA model on Amazon. I am sure this flashlight(the 3-cell AA) is great as well, it is just not the newest version so it doesn't have all the kinks worked out of it and also does NOT have a multimode electronic switch where you can switch between full power, 25% power, strobe and SOS modes. Just thought I would clarify this that this model is a couple of years (if not a few years) old so I would recommend the newest model which is the 2-cell AA model. Hope this helps!"
4,Great Flashlight,"For a ""mini"" flashlight, I was expecting something a little bit smaller - it's a little bulky for a backpack. However, the light is crisp and bright. Works well, and is built tough. Great job"
3,Alkaline Batteries are designed for 70 Deg F usage,"I had a Duracell AAA battery burst in a flash light I keep in the car. I called Duracell and they replaced the batteries and flashlight. Then Duracell said the alkaline batteries are for operation at 70 Degrees F. I contacted a friend who is a PhD in Chemical Engineering. He said the reaction rate for alkaline batteries doubles for each 10 degree rise in temperature. So... leaving a flashlight in the car in the summer, where temperatures are 120 Degrees F plus, is not good. The re-chargable batteries have less chemicals and less problems with temperature. I took all the alkaline battery flashlights out of the cars. I have some Power On Board 26 Led Bright stick rechargeable batteries. These have been in the cars for years and still work fine."
1,Not good help for resumes,"The book suggests using indents and tabs to make a resume. Using tabs would make things bump around strangely if you edit or change font. No mention of using a table and turning off the lines to make placing text and editing easy. Resume they do make is not a great-looking document, and has (for my field) awkward formatting (like the year buried at the end of the line). No mention of Word's online resume templates. I'd hoped to have this book as a reference for students, but the suggestions in here are things I'd tell them NOT to do. Skip this book. Get a good book on using Word, and Robin Williams excellent book on graphic design tips, ""The Non-Designer's Design Book""."
3,i agree...lacks graphics,"pc is really great if you are looking for a fast processor that can handle dvds, cdrws and desktop imaging. but i made the mistake of buying this and expecting to play games like hitman 2, madden 2003 and grand theft auto 2. hitman is decent, madden is ok, gta is horrible. the intel chip is sub par compared to any graphics board out there, and the sad thing is that this 6350us does not have an onboard AGP slot. very tough indeed. i will have settle for a low end geforce4. :("
2,Too much $$$ for what you get.,"Wanted a set of these for a while, especially after I had trimmed fenders previously and wanted to cover it up. They look very good...My biggest issue, partly my own fault for not researching more, was the fact that if there is an aftermarket rear bumper (RockHard 4x4) the Bushwacker's will need to be trimmed to fit.Extremly over priced for a couple of pieces of molded plastic. Once I saw all of the pieces, I thought that I should not paid over $200 for this product.Installed for about 8 months now and I feel this was the worst part I've ever bought or put on my rig. The money could've went to something more useful; like beefing up the D30 or something. Also, these are on my DD with 33"" BFG's; which these flares made the width of the axles look narrow. I put spacers on to compensate for this. I am torn over spacers, due to the leverage they put on the wheel studs."
3,Weird,"Wow. I felt like I walked inside the skin of a nut - and I was fooled almost till the last minute. Unlike some reviewers, I did NOT find the character particularly likeable - neurotic, self-absorbed, and so forth - but being an inveterate reader of science fiction and/or fantasy, I plowed on through to see where the story would take me. But in fact it ends inside the mind of a madwoman, and if there's a story arc here - it's about how and where madness might take one. I have no idea what this story was supposed to be 'about'. Perhaps that was the point."
2,Trivial - an introduction for the layperson only.,Basic info for the layperson only. Keep looking for a more robust explanation. Hard to believe that this is used as a text book.
2,disappointed,This book is very limited in scope and style. There are many good examples of drawing (nearly identical) vines with little flowers but almost nothing else besides examples of what to do with your vines and flowers. I really expected more from this book due to the good reviews it received.
2,ozie boo,"I received the wrong video, It was returned bacause I received the wrong videoAfter several phone calls still have not received creditYou guys must not issue credit, only make promisesWill probably not purchase from you againIf you would like to discuss I can be reached at 252-623-9516"
4,Death metal/black metal nexus,"I bought this when it came out, gave it a perfunctory half-listen, and interred it. Listened to it today (1/13/07) and am highly impressed by its power, complexity, and velocity. You'll recognize a lot of Emperor riffs and rhythms here, for obvious reasons, but that's not bad. It's very good. Without synths and Ihsan's heroic vocals, you're left with a very heavy sound which emphasizes black metal's descent from death. The crushing Samothite guitar notwithstanding, which sounds both warm and futuristic, intentional and relaxed, it is the drumming that takes this album to the next level - fairly natural, almost acoustic sound, with a slight reverboid depth - ultimately overwhelming in density and concision. Definite Morbid Angel damage on this, but I would say that the similarities stem from a shared metaphysical perspective, rather than the more obviously shared, borrowed, or inherited aesthetic."
1,terrible.,"man i thought this computer was good times when my father first bought one... for about 4 months. then i became technicaly competent and discovered that the power supply is a TURD, the graphics card was an easy replacement (on the grounds that it blows), and the dvd-rw is god awful. save a few hundred and buy sonys 21"" crt and make a custom from tigerdirect...i wish i could rate 0."
3,An up and coming new author with great promise,"Kimmile Aczon shows every sign of being a master of the truly scary novel -- the off-beat; who can catch you with her words and syntax to keep you hanging on until you finally close the book -- at its end! That was my experience with it. ""BJ"" is a grabber!"
2,PASS,"I got this book & his book on the AR15 as a package deal, and must say they are the horrible!Though there is some info about the glock pistol, the other two thirds of the book is full of info on other guns & his boast's of what a great shooter he is. If you cut out all his self promoting & 1911, browing hipower & other gun info the book would be about 100 pages long & a decent read. There is also a lot of off track story telling & circle talk that make you forget about what the topic was to begin with.The people who gave this book 5 stars must be realatives, or fans of his.I had a hard time giving it 2 stars, but if your skip all the B.S. there was some info about the glock in there.If your are looknig for a book about glock's you like me will end up looking somewhere else"
1,REVIEWS!!,"I actually was in the process of purchasing this book, but before doing so I decided to read recent reviews. After doing so, I reconsidered and decided NOT to get book. Thanks to all for the heads up!!"
3,The works of Kafka published in his lifetime,"This volume contains the works of Kafka published in his lifetime: The Metamorphosis, Meditation, The Stoker, The Judgment, The Hunger(Fasting)Artist, Airplanes of Brescia.One of the pieces, the Metamorphosis (In this volume called ,""Transformation"") is one of Kafka's most famous work. Gregor Samsa who woke one day to discover himself to be a crawling creature, and whose plight as insect is taken to be the family situation of Kafka is one of the major characters of twentieth - century Literature.Kafka disturbs, and brings us to a level of fear and anxiety perhaps no other writer can. How he does this with sentences of incredible beauty is both chilling and mysterious.His work is parabolic, symbolic and seems to suggest to us more about the imprisoned and lost situation of Mankind than we would somehow really like to know.Perhaps reading him is not for everyone.But for those ready to bear the uncanny weight of literary beauty this is the answer."
3,Not bad but has issues......,"I bought this brand new at the store in town, and had to actually take it back once before. The first one I bought locked when I tried to cock it and then whole top half popped right off. The second one stayed together very well. When loading it the bb's had problems collecting in the right area to be loaded. I had to manually place them in the slot to be fired, which isn't too bad and is really easy just mildly annoying. Also not every time the trigger is pulled is a bb shot which really sucks. All in all its not a bad gun for a first time shooter or buyer. If you want a bb gun as an adult to play with I'd skip this one. It'd be good for younger ones though."
1,do not buy!!!,This pistol was pretty good but right i could have gotten this gun cheaper and i think looks a lot cooler. I sold the gun and got the gun at big 5 and the gun was so much better then this one. The sale goes until Dec.24 2008. So if you wanted to buy this gun buy it at big 5 even after when the sale ends because the gun is way better there then here!!!!!!!!Do not Buy this gun buy it only from Big 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I wouldn't take these,"Vit B12 either by injection or subligual tabs (under the toungue) are very effective mainly for vegetarians like me who do not eat meat. B12 is found in meats,and dairy. B12 is not found in sufficient amounts in plants to be of any use. With that said, if you are trying to improve your health why would anyone want to buy this product that has Sorbitol in it? This is what it conatains:Other Ingredients: Sorbitol, Stearic Acid, Natural Flavors, Silica, Citric Acid and Mallic Acid find another brand with another sweetner."
2,Ammendment to previous negative review,"OnGuard PitBull STD 5003 Bicycle U-LockStrong lock but the mounting system sucks. Will not tighten enough to keep lock in place. Very little thought went into this mounting bracket and it shows. Had a problem with the mounting section on the shank sliding down rendering the lock useless. Contacted the company and they told me to buy a wrench at my local hardware store to fix it. I do not consider that customer supportAmendment to above review. It would seem this lock came with a ratchet mounting system when it first came out which is what I got. I emailed the company and sure enough, they have a new mounting system which is WAY BETTER. They sent it gratus which I think is very commendable. I recommend this lock wholehartedly if you get the new mounting system."
3,"Okay, not exceptional","Feels durable and strong, but is quite heavy. Why spend that extra money on light bike parts when you're lock is 10x as heavy? It's about 1/4"" too small to fit easily around an average sign post. Feels like good quality for the price though. I'd recommend it, but only if your city has a lot of bike racks (because they have smaller poles for easier locking). One other thing: Why did they make the keys so big!?"
1,Thieves cut right through it,"I bought this U-Lock for my daughter who is a college student in Philadelphia. The first night she was there, she locked her bike up to a secure lamppost on her porch, and woke up to find both lock and bike gone. The Philly police said the lock was no match for the professional thieves working in this urban neighborhood. So much for the product's grand-sounding claims--""optimum resistance to picking and reinforced sleeve over crossbar for additional security"" and ""13mm ultra-hardened steel shackle provides maximum cut resistance."" Sounds good, but proved useless."
4,bike lock,"Item as advertised and arrived on time. Not familiar with bike locks so cannot offer a comparison re other makes/models re value, quality, etc. For the price is was adequate for my needs."
2,"Love Mario's Stuff, but not this",This spoon is definatley note the same quality as his other spoons and utensiles. The slots cut in the spoon are left with wood shavings in them and the slots are not rounded. I hesitate using this spoon with the shavings in the slots and will likey send them back or throw them out. I do however LOVE his spatchula and his non-sloted wooden spoons and risoto scrapper thingy. The handle is great even for me with my big hands.
1,Not up to Mario Batali standards,I previously order the Mario Batali 11 inch slotted spoon that I'm very happy with but I needed a slightly larger version. The 13 inch spoon I received appeared to be unfinished from the factory. There are wood slivers hanging out of the slots and it doesn't have the smooth coating of the 11 inch. The spoon feels very rough and the wood slivers catch food particles quite easily clogging up the slots. I ended up throwing this spoon away after only about 5 uses.
4,Fit perfect in my cj-7,I bought this box for the back of my jeep cj7 and it fit like a glove. I would buy it again!
5,camper battery box,I bought this to put my Rv battery in to keep it dry and secure. It has been installed for almost 2 years and is holding strong! Get one.
3,This book is kinda good,It has to do with the 4th Son of the Dark and what his power is. I thought that his power was okay but not as impressive as the Daughters powers. There is some humor in this book though. I will keep on reading this series. Lets hope that the rest of the books are good and funny.
1,Wrong product recieved,I ordered a Bulova Watch (Ladies) w/ a diamond Bezel. The watch I recievedhad no diamonds & as of this date I still do not have the correct order.
3,Rolling Cart,"This cart served its purpose(my dad's mechanic work), but I know the expiration date is near. It is cheaply built."
2,Caveat Emptor,"If you're considering this CD for ""Spellbound"" be aware that the theremin part is played by one of the woodwinds (sounds like an oboe to me). Needless to say this was quite a disappointment and is the principal reason for my poor (two-star) recommendation. The performance of the Rozsa Concerto is adequate but not by any means outstanding."
5,bird spikes work,This was my second order as my first didn't have enough spikes. They work really well and are not completely unsightly. The order and shipping went extremely well both times. I highly recommend the product.
5,Great book,"covers everything in detail: all the players, all the managers, all the parks and number of minor leaguers too."
3,Women of Primrose Creek,I did not enjoy this book as much as some others I have read of Linda Lael Miller.
2,Nutrition information is incorrect,"The nutrition information is entirely inaccurate. I ordered these based on the nutrition information; Amazon did refund my money and I gave the bars to my local food bank. I hear they were very good in taste, but with a restricted diet, there was no way I could chance trying them. They did arrive on time and were packaged well, however."
4,"Hard to the bone, need a buzz to take the edge off",There is a repetitive bass beat that could be used less. Bam Bam is much better live. But the CD is good too.
2,Tri-Fold wallet,"Wallet is too small, specially the front id window. Doesn't fold flat when wallet is closed."
3,Uninspired,"I have everything these guys have done since their big breakthrough album ""A Boy Named Goo"". However, this effort falls short for a number of reasons.1. Of the 11 tracks, two are the throwaway trash that the goofy guy (Robby) garbles through. Two are ""Give a Little Bit"" and ""Better Days"" that FM radio overplayed well in advance of this release. Therefore, there are only 7 new tracks that most fans even want to hear.2. Most of these seven songs blend together as they have the same tempo and style. They are largely forgettable slow to mid tempo rockers.Yes there a couple of exceptions - the lead single ""Stay WIth You"" has some energy and edginess and ""We'll be Here"" should be the next single but it probably won't be. The closer ""Become"" is decent but by this point, you are wondering where the spark and intensity has went.It's a shame - just wait you will find this quickly in your local used CD store."
2,Safe,"I'm not crazy about this album. All the songs sound the same. It's ""safety rock"". The band really isn't coming up with anything new or inspiring on this album. Gutterflower gave me hope, but this one sure doesn't."
3,Too dark for me,"Too dark for me.This review requires that I write ten more words. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."
4,BBVD's Third Effort,"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy bursted on the scene in the movie Swingers and through their first album, ""Americana Deluxe."" Their second release, ""This Beautiful Life,"" was an outstanding album, but largly ignored.With ""Save My Soul"", the third album, it seems like the boys changed their sound a bit. Retro-Swing bursted on the scene in the 90s but soon died down. I guess the boys knew this and switched up their sound with their third try. That sound became the New Orleans sound.From my point of view, it seems like this album did not get the respect it deserved. I had to order it through Amazon because I couldn't even find it at any store. Even though the sound has changed, the fire is still there. Outstanding songs with outstanding energy.If you love BBVD, then I totally recommend this album. Not just to complete your BBVD collection, but to see how the band continues to evolve and mature."
2,junk dont wast your money they will blow!,these tweeters are a joke....went through 3 sets so far 1 set was junk out of the box i have them on 75rms each they are NOT loud at all my co-axles drown these out with ease...i know there cheap but don't wast your time or money on these 1 set of 3 still works with less than 3 months of play time in a SPL truck used 1 - 3 times a month!
2,Compact and sharp but broke easily,I bought this saw to replace a similar one that was lost. That one lasted for years. I used this saw for the first time today and it worked great on the first root that I was cutting but then it snapped near the base on the second one.
5,Gerber Sportsman's Woodsaw Awesome,"I bought this saw for my boyfriend, who had been looking for this model at local stores, all of whom were sold out. A video comparison on YouTube convinced him that this was the one to get. For such an inexpensive saw, it's capability is impressive, as it cuts through wood very quickly & cleanly. We have a few tree branches that needed some trimming---and it easily did the job in just a few swipes of the blade. Great product---will be ordering a second, just for yard work!"
1,pdkempl,Purchased in the spring and it was dead by the end of August. My daughter is the only one that uses pencils and it couldn't keep up with her for 6 months. It appears to be a broken switch that detects when a pencil is inserted. I'm looking for a different brand.
4,Good Information with Good Humor,"After reading only a couple of chapters, I can see that this is an invaluable guidebook to have if one is planning to attempt any basic maintenance on one's motorcycle. It is even helpful to learn these things if one deals with a mechanic/shop, since professionals are so much easier to negotiate with if one has a handle on what is being discussed in the way of repairs. The author has a good sense of humor, and the sometimes dry details are sprinkled with quips that motorcyclists will appreciate."
4,Motorcycle Maintenance review,The book is a detailed overview of motorcycle repairs. Well written and easy enough to go through - a few more diagrams or photos may have helped but then it would be too easy!
2,Too bad it doesn't spend much time talking about maintenance,"I must say that I was disappointed at the misleading title of this book. I thought that it was more about maintenance issues, but instead it tries to cover the basics of ""how a motorcycle works"". I can think of MUCH better books on this topic, such as Kevin Cameron's ""Sportbike Performance Handbook"", which despite its title, really is more about motorcycle technology. Another great book on the topic would be Gaetano Cocco's ""Motorcycle Design and Technology"".The maintenance sections in this book suffer from being squeezed into the margins, with fairly small photographs, so that it is sometimes difficult to see what the author is really talking about. Of course, one cannot really fault this book alone, since most books on mechanics appear to suffer this fault.Bottom line: It's mostly about ""how a bike works"", and there are much better books out there on that subject. Too bad it doesn't cover maintenance in greater detail."
3,beginners only,"this book is for the don't know nothing about a motorcycle other than to turn the key to start it. basic, very basic your owners manual will do just as good."
3,Five and One is Six,"Uhhh, The DVD doesn't work. Shipped and sold by Amazon.com. Package appears to have been opened. The inside of the DVD case cracked. The tracks looks like they have been scratched and the security tape on the DVD appears to have been tampered with. And the DVD doesn't play besides showing me the titles and the four years. Maybe I'll learn about Lance the biker on Wiki. Great.... Not gonna return it. Goes straight to trash bin."
2,Uncle Mame?,"Keith Fleming is a pretty good storyteller. He really makes you picture the times, places and characters in his life. Especially strong is the evil Doctor at the hospital and his wonderful uncle in New York City. (Edmund White) These characters and moments really stand out.However most of this book just rambles about and then ends with no purpose whatsoever. At the end I wondered ""why did he write it"" and ""why did I read it?"". I would not recommend this book because it just meanders and ends with no explanation. I need more of a story arc even from a biography.The other thing that puzzled me was why he would paint such a wonderful loving tribute to his uncle and then ruin it by mentioning an offhand sexual advance by his uncle. It seemed out of place never explored his feelings behind it or why it was even mentioned. It was kind of unsavory without a reason for it.Keith needed a good editor on this book and some guidance."
3,material too hard,I agree with some other reviewers. This product is so hard that it could potentially damage the vehicle. Huh? Wasn't the idea to get something that would protect the vehicle? I wrapped a cloth around it to soften the surface. There must be better products out there that are better designed.
1,These suck!,"I buy mine for 60 cents a piece their barely worth that, and you have to throw then really hard."
5,Best Latin Rock Album Ever,"It perhaps the greatest work by a latin rock group. All the songs are awesome. You can feel the energy this band has in every song. They got back together in 2000, I can't wait for their upcoming release due in the summer."
5,The best Alternative band in all Latin America!,"This is the best album by a Alternative Latin American band, Bohemia Suburbana ""Mil palabras con sus dientes"" is the Nirvana ""Nevermind"" of Central America!! in my opinion one of the top 10 albums of the 90's (including the U.S. and Europe)this album will blow your mind!"
3,"Its not a bad machine, but they do get better","I bought this expecting more, don't get me wrong it is a good notebook, but shop around. The hard drives are too small, the track pad is a pain in my ___, And I HATE Windows,(Microsoft in general) If this had 160GB drive(s) and RedHat Linux 9 I would love it....but..no!Avoid Windows products at all costs, espically XP(nothing but 2000's bug fix's...if that!!) True computer nuts know what I mean. But if you are on a budget, and like Windows(ugggh) this is not a bad choice..like I said shop around and compare."
5,Superb!,"Responding to the review by the ROTC APMS, I found this book to be anything but dry. I was stunned at the parallels I discovered between the old Army and the modern Marine Corps. I read it mid-career and a lot of issues the author brings up resonated due to experience. That cadets found it dry does not surprise me in the least - they have no frame of reference. Their instructor's response, while disappointing, does not surprise me at all.My last experience with Army training was in 2006 at the newly revamped Civil Affairs course at Ft. Bragg. Much of it was classroom lecture focussed on absorbing doctrine, vice practical techniques for actual operations. There was some good training, but they could have achieved so much more in 9 weeks. I think the ""modern"" Army needs to read this book. Anyone responsible for teaching a new skill set should do the same."
2,Overrated & Outdated,"I am an Assistant Professor of Military Science at an ROTC university and I used this book for my class, based on the excellent reviews it has received. However, both my cadets and I found the reading to be dry & many of the issues brought up by the author may have been relevant during the Vietnam & post Vietnam area, but do not apply to the modern Army. The book might be better suited if one was strictly studying the Army during the Vietnam area, but I cannot otherwise recommend it."
1,Worst Semi-Musical EVER!,"There were two things that I really hated about this movie: the music and the forest. I'm not sure where they shot this movie, but the trees looked like they were most likely eucalyptus trees. You'd think they could have at least found a nice dark forest somewhere that would be reminiscent of the dark woods you'd expect in this sort of tale. The poor selection of filming locations might be over-looked, but the incredibly banal music was just unforgivable! I talked to a couple of young kids after they'd watched this movie and they very adamantly insisted that it was a terrible movie. In general I'd say that this movie was on the verge of being amateurish (despite the presense of well-known actors) except that someone did a nice job building the gingerbread house. If it weren't for that element of the movie, I'd rate it at zero stars instead of one star! (NOTE: The child actors did a fine job performing their roles and it is not at all their fault that the movie is so lame!)"
5,Kid's favorite!,"We have two boys that adore this book. We have to read it every night of the week! Even our ten year old still likes it. The fantasy of driving a car when you are a small child is right on target in this book. Mr. Appleby adds the excitement of magic, the drive through the opening in the bushes adds a sense of wonder, and the illustrations are bright and alive. The artwork matches the story perfectly. Every young child can identify themselves in this book, which is why our kids, and all of their friends enjoy this book over and over. This book also appeared briefly in the movie ""Enough"", starring Jennifer Lopez, which our oldest son spotted and was proud to have owned a ""movie book""."
4,Tin,"Quality product. Very nice sounding. A lot of features for the price.The only reason I rate this 4 stars is because the first dock I ordered was defective. The FM radio did not work at all. Seems strange that something so simple like an FM radio not functioning. Bottom line, we replaced it with the same dock and everything worked properly.I would purchase this again."
5,For my Celica GTS,Great investment! Buy the the recharge kit and you will never need to buy another filter again. They are very easy to clean and include both instructions and stickers. Highly recommended.
3,"It's nice, informative but...","I liked the book, but I wish it had more information or more examples, either by the author or by other artists in the medium. In order for me to really learn about the medium, I have had to buy not only this book but others about the same subject as well... It is not a problem with this book in particular, but a problem with ALL colored pencil books. All of them show a ""part"" of the what the medium has to offer. I wish there was a ""compendium"" of several authors about the subject, so we, aspiring artists, would have some sort of ""big book"" or ""bible"" about this."
4,Practical yet still adorable..,"I chose this particular bassinet because I wanted something practical and easy to move around. I also don't have room for a regular sized pack-n-play. I have 2 weeks until my due date, so I have not tested it with our baby girl yet, and that is the reason I did not give it 5 stars. I will say that it was fairly simple for me to assemble while being nine months pregnant. The wheels make it very easy to move from room to room and it fits perfectly through any doorway. It also seems to be very sturdy. It looks absolutely adorable and cannot wait to see if my baby likes it too."
2,Not impressed.,Didn't like the book at all. Was very disappointed in it. I have nothing else to say about the book.
5,Excellent method explained very well,"A problem so common, it well deserves its own booklet!This effective, pain- and gimmick-free method of teaching loose leash walking is not really a creation of the author - you'll find it in other positive training books under names like ""Be a Tree"" or ""Red Light Green Light."" However, Ms. Rugaas explains it very well and adds an element that will really benefit you and the dog.I do think she needed to emphasize a bit more how absolutely consistent you must be to get this method to work, but that applies to any training. Another thing that I found to be of huge benefit is using a hands-free leash (to prevent the human from physically manipulating the dog into place; dogs, like people, learn best when they are allowed to figure out what works). Applause to the author for supporting the use of a harness, which in my experience dogs much prefer and better understand compared to a neck collar or a head halter."
2,Looking for something more,"I was hoping to find more photos of the Nuba. This book is a representation of a variety of her work: portraits of Riefenstahl, movie characters, Olympics, some Nuba and underwater exploration. I may have to purchase the books that deal specifically with the Nuba... which are incredible photos."
1,This is an abridged edition,For some inexplicable reason the English translation omits portions of the original. The US publisher neglected to inform the reader of this little detail - I find this practice totally unacceptable (hence 1 star).
5,Feathermerchants or bust!,"I recently had the opportunity to check out Feathermerchants live in Boston at the Lizard Lounge....as well as a live in-studio radio performance (WXRV in Boston) .... words cannot explain how awesome this band is! They put on an amazing show, and they are all great people, to boot! I urge you to run, not walk, to your local music store and pick up their CD! You won't be disappointed. They have such a unique sound, its hard to even pinpoint a particular artist to compare them with. This band is here to stay! Come back to Boston soon! :o)"
3,Cowboy Junkies Redux,"If you like the Cowboy Junkies, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this group. I bought this disk because of the promised Middle Eastern influence, but it is so far in the background as to be barely audible.As with the Cowboy Junkies, the lead singers (apparently there are two) are so strong that it is difficult to listen to all twelve cuts at one sitting -- they soon become monotonous. On the other hand, all of the cuts are good standing by themselves.Judging from the reviews posted by other listeners, this may be one of those bands that is great in concert but is not a studio band. Having not been to one of their concerts, I wouldn't know."
2,Outdated and DVD is a joke,"The book is written in a good style with the ususal volume of screenshots.But it is published in 2003 and in the mean time in the MS certification world things have changed dramatically.Not only is SUS called WSUS today but also some fundamental changes are introduced with the release of SP1 for Windows Server 2003.Also the exams have changed: The introduction of the simulator and the exam is more demanding.Mainly based on this book I did the exam and failed. Not big time, but who cares.So I ordered the 4 volume core requirements 2nd edition from Microsoft Press. There was a lot of detail I missed in this book. Still studying but feel confident the MS Press set will help me pass the exam.Well and the DVD..... I said it all in the title. The female presentor (Certified MS instructor as well) is good looking, but it's not even enough material for a last minute recap.Not a recommendation this book."
5,Lovely Anne Cochran,I was introduced to Ms. Cochran at a Jim Brickman concert. She is amazing and I will always be a fan.
5,Project X,I enjoyed this movie but I wouldnt recommend this for young kids. Its sad at times and could make a child cry. But it does make you wonder what kind of tests really go on with our government?
1,What a waste of time and money,"This program took forever to install, downloaded a bunch of software before it could start the install, and gave no guarantee that the downloaded software was protected. Then the bridge was the same cheesy, stupid bidding and play as the cheap version! The bidding was pretty damn limited and did not always follow their own explanation of the bidding ""rules""! I always thought bridge was a partnership game but I felt like my partner in this game was my enemy. This game is primitive and frustrating.I hate them."
3,"Great DVD, but.......................","This is a great DVD, but there should be more shows then the the four. That's probalbly the only reason I wouldn't purchase any more of these DVD's. Either include more episodes or lower the price!!"
5,Great stories to encourage young girls to read.,My 12 year old granddaughter has really taken an interest in reading during the last few months and I was looking for a fanciful and fun series after she had read all the Limney Snickets books she could get her hands on.This fills the bill and today we just ordered 2 more for collection.
3,"Charming illustrations, but didn't capture this toddler's attention","This seemed like such a great book, and I was sure that my toddler son would love it. Unfortunately, he has been completely indifferent to it. I thought the language was fun and witty, and the illustrations festive, but it hasn't managed to capture his attention in the least, and he has yet to sit through one full reading of it. Perhaps some day he'll learn to like it, but for now it sits unread on our shelf. But it's a beautiful little book, and the frog on the cover makes at least momma smile, if not baby."
3,havoc books,"I've read her other book which is well written. This one is a 'hard' read. Seems like she tried too hard to be descriptive and ""intelligent"" in her writing. It makes for slow comprehension and reading, but at the same time, interesting."
2,Be careful,"I bought NYT Easy crossword puzzles 2 & 3 after I completed the ""NYT Easy Crossword puzzles"" book, assuming these would be next in the series. Unfortunately the crosswords in the first book are repeated in books 2 & 3. Don't get these if you've already completed the first book in the series."
2,Eh... it's OK.,"My first exposure to the music of Chris Spheeris was through Dances with the Muse: WOW! Each song was like a feast for my soul (OK, a little exaggerationg there, but you get the point). So naturally, I wanted more. I listened to the snippets online and thought this CD might be just as good. Nope. I felt like I was trying to reach 5th gear but only got to well.. 2nd.There are others out there who love it, and to them: glad you bought it. As for me... I no longer own one. I'm going to try his other CDs.And if you are wondering whether to ignore me or take my comments to heart, I also like ""The Best of Amr Diab"" by Amr Diab, ""Alegria"" 'by' Cirque du Soleil, ""Choice Languages"" by Capercaille, and ""Karma"" by Delirium."
4,History Made Interesting,"Ms. Leon is clearly a well-researched historian, and has endeavoured to provide useful information in easily digestible sound-bites for those who could otherwise be bored by history. Brava! I really enjoyed this book, and plan on getting the others in the series. People who never read history will be entertained by the short, informative, juicy little 1-page tidbits on each compelling woman. Ms. Leon presents a view of some of these women that is different for what I have seen elsewhere, and I would be interested in seeing how she arrived at some of her conclusions. Probably another story."
5,An excellent resource for parents who want to teach universal religious values to their children,"We are a deist family who is committed to raising ethical children who understand and respect religious differences and appreciate the value of multiculturalism. I've been reading a story from to book to my 5 yr old son every night and we use it as a starting point to discuss spirituality, religious tolerance and how each of us can build a personal relationship with God. It is a great resource, regardless of your religious affiliation, if you want to raise open minded children."
4,Hard to find a blue topaz,I am love the ring. It is a gift and I'm well pleased with the product. Seller is easy to do business with.
5,Helpful,I thought this was one of the best books I've read on breeding. It helped me through my first litter of pups.
2,Not so great,I received this set with the handle of the small pan broken. The pans scratch easily and are very lightweight.
5,The best laugh Iv'e had this year,"Non stop hilarious, my jaws ached my sides ached I laughed until I cried this movie is very funny.If you like zainy wacky movies you'll love this, I usually don't rate anything but I couldn''t resist suggesting this one, it's great"
1,Alex Z,Power plug got stuck and broken after first use. Gauge is not accurate that makes it completely useless.
4,Will save me tons of time - great product,"Worked fine....earlier year models and problems appeared to be fixed. I was able to afix the shift on my ATV, they have lock washers now, and Ihad no problems my belts."
1,Read and perish,"Warning this book will cause your IQ to drop by several points. Mr Duke using flawed and false research and broken reasoning to make the same old tired racist claims of superiority of the white race. The views being no diferent than when he was spouting them as a member of the KKK, same old pig but with new lip stick. what magazine/comic book did he apply to for his PHD? The only people who will find this book useful will be those wishing to re-enforce the same point of view."
4,Smiling Sammy,"This is a very informative guide with many wonderful pictures of of Samoyed puppies and blue ribbon winners. The reader gets a real feel for the progression of the breed and of what makes a Samoyed so beautiful. The book gives a well researched history of the breed and the book is amazingly thorough. It covers every conceivable question about the breed. I got a knewfound appreciation for this dog. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in these breathtaking animals. Beware that after reading this book you WILL want one, I assure you."
5,Outstanding debut novel!,"The Recovery is a fast paced novel depicting the fallibility of an orthopedic surgeon. I was shown the real side of chemical dependency and how the damage can be to everyone the addict comes in contact with. The novel also shows that despite appearances, a doctor is subject to lots of difficulties, everything from nutty in-laws to low self-esteem. I was drawn into Jeremy Graf's life. The characters and the plot make this a book worth recommending."
4,The Recovery,"The strength of The Recovery lies in the plot...it is an interesting story with well-developed and interesting characters that really drew me in. I found myself thinking about the characters and caring about what happened to them.Why didn't I give the book 5 stars--I'd probably have given it four and a half if I could--it was a very enjoyable read. It lost a half star with me because of some of the language. Especially at the beginning, the author uses some complicated words (think SAT preparation) and my personal preference is to keep things simple. Still, it was an easy, comfortable read and other readers may not find the word use 0ff-putting. Also, I'm a tough critic...So, check it out. The author is himself a surgeon, and this makes his perspective in a medical novel much more compelling than the usual."
4,A 'feel good' story,This is the first romance I've read where the story starts out with the heroine nine months pregnant and ends shortly after she has her baby. The story is heart warming or a nice one night or weekend read. I wish the story was a hundred pages longer to explain Connor's story and a little more of the background of Moira. I've read of the the other L'eau Clair stories and I think this is the best one--and I enjoyed the others too!
4,speakers,These speakers do well but they dont get as low I would like and i have a high-powered amp to push them. these speakers will last longer as they dont have paper and styrofoam.
4,Ridiculously addictive.,"At first I thought this game was a little cartoonish, the graphics are a bit childish. But it is a ridiculously addictive, fun little game. Nothing pretentious or earth shattering, just an immensely playable, entertaining and involving RPG game."
3,Download a demo from Yahoo Games. Try before you buy.,"The demo is making me rethink a purchase, mostly because of the kiddie graphics and top down only view. I give it four stars because it is entertaining, but it's doubtful I'd play this for very long--and I really enjoy RPGs like Gothic 2 or Vampire Bloodlines."
1,Wild Tangent is a terrible software maker,"Be Ware of Wild Tangent. They sold us the boxed game but did not give us the unlock code for the software. We are still buying tokens to play the game even though we thought we purchase the boxed game. After many e-mails to the company, we are still unable to load the actual game on our PC!! Our son is very disappointed!"
5,This is fun,It is hard to get away from this game. I usualy go to bed at 9pm because of early school. When I'm playing Fate I'll stay up until 1am.
4,Versatile but HEAVY,"This dogbone does exactly what it's advertised to do. Securely holds whatever you attach to, or attach from it. My only caveat, is it's HEAVY. This is also it's strength. This is probably the reason it can handle whatever you throw at it."
5,Winner this Christmas!!!,"This is a very durable toy my 12-yest-old sone adores! It is large and does so many things and ""Looks cool"". My son will spend hours playing with it in an imaginary world. A little on the heavy side for smaller kids, but very well made and thought through. I highly suggest this purchase for the masculine boy :)"
4,A must have for Wallace and Gromit fans!,"Shaun has some pretty good advice for a sheep! While this little book is humorous the advice is down to earth and practical. Nothing you don't already know but things that we all need reminding of once in a while. My only complaint was that the book was much smaller than I imagined. It's only a 5 minute read and is more of a cute novilty than anything else. Still, as a big fan of Wallace and Gromit I'm happy to have Shaun the sheep right there next to all the other motivational books on my shelf!"
3,This is an interesting look into the life of an athlete...,"yes, Wilt does come across as a bit egotistical, but think about modern athletes...many of them will probably not age gracefully either. Basketball is full of self-righteous prima donna athletes who wont' gracefully fade away...Having said that, the guy slept with over 20,000 women...c'mon - he deserves some credit. This is the same as having sex with one woman a day for 54.7 years (a different woman each day...)Being conservative - this works out to an average of 1.36 women a day for 40 years. Not even I expect to touch those numbers...."
4,I would say this is solid 4 1/2 stars,"Cathy Maxwell just get's better and better. I always know that when I pick up one of her books, I am bound to enjoy it. And the new one is no exception. It is a worthwile read. The only thing I found odd with the book was that in one scene at vaux hall Deb meets an old family friend of her mother's and he asks her to visit him and she says she will, and then he and his wife are never mentioned again. I kept thinking when will he spring back up in the book - it seemed like the scene was going to lead somewhere and didn't. I wonder if it originally did and was edited out. Oh well, it was just something that stuck with me. If you like Cathy Maxwell this is a MUST READ."
3,good rapper-disappointing album,"WC certainly has the skills and capability but for some reason this album is uninspired and boring.I purchased bow down by the west coast connection, a few months ago, and that was much more interesting and listenable.I listened to that album every day for 3 months.This album has not found its way to my cd player after 8 times listening to it. There is no enthusiasm to play it again.Avoid this album and buy 'Bow Down' instead. That album showcases wc's skills much better than the shadiest one"
5,This is one of the best West Side CD's ever,"This is true West Side CD. WC is one of the best rappers. This CD has great beats and lyrics. Also, he features Ice Cube, Mack 10, Too Short, E-40, CJ Mac and other WestSide rappers which make this CD even better. My favorite tracks are ""The Shadiest One"", ""Just Clownin'"", ""Worldwide Gunnin'"", and ""Cheddar."" If you like true WestSide rap you should definitely get this CD."
5,BooYaa,This Album Is Killer. You never get bored of it cause all the songs have different beats and sweet lyrics. Just one more thing....... If you don't have it....... Go buy it!
5,You get what you pay for,"Short of hiring a private tutor, the best way to prepare for the LSAT is to practice, and taking past LSATs is the best practice there is. One thing to keep in mind is that none of the three books of old LSATs that LSAC publishes (10 Actual, 10 More, and the Next 10) include any of the new Comparative Reading questions (they were introduced only a few years ago). I recommend seeking out a Kaplan text in order to practice for those questions."
4,Good Review Material,"This is a must have, although the questions are old and the methodology and structure of some of the questions have changed. That being said, these LSAT PrepTests are the best of what's available for practice tests."
5,"yes, we can live 150 years if we are determined",His natural remedies really work. I had found myself feeling younger and energized after using the body cleansing. I totally recommend his books.
3,Not THAT bad,"Cover albums are dangerous things, especially with songs that were done right the first time. What's worse is that when a band goes 3-4 years between new CDs, a disc full of cover tunes is going to be a disappointment from the get-go, no matter how good.That said, there are some good renditions of classic songs here. Walrus is cool, Miles and Miles is pretty good. The new version of blue collar man starts out with a nice bluesy feel which self-destructs with the chorus.Worth hearing, but it's not going to be spending a lot of time in my CD player. Hoping we don't have to wait another three years for new Styx material."
1,Not worthy of Styx name,Just another Example of Shaw and Young Squeezing every last Nickel from the Styx name. They Fired DDY to do this Garbage?. With out him they must have ran out of ideas.
4,a FUN CD,"If you're favorite Styx song of all time is ""Babe"", don't buy this CDThis is rock! So what if it's all cover songs? they rock!I agree there are 1 or 2 that aren't to my taste, but the musicianship is killer! And the sound is right on target.The original recordings of these songs sound muddy, because of the poor recording techniques back in the 60's and 70's. It's awesome to hear ""I can see for miles"" with crystal clear pounding drums.I didn't buy this CD expecting ""Dark Side of the Moon"", I bought it to hear a revamping of some great classic tunes.I too can't wait for Styx's next CD of originals, but this disc stands on it's own as quality stuff.I saw them do I Am The Walrus in concert and it brought the house down. Listen to this version of Manic Depression , then listen to Hendrix's. The sound quality difference is staggering, and Styx has done these songs justice"
2,Missing Dennis DeYoung,"My wife is a big Styx fan and we've been to three of their concerts in recent years. In the concerts I've seen, they played mostly the old stuff, and I like the old stuff. However, I did wonder why they didn't have any good new stuff.About a month ago, my wife and I saw Dennis DeYoung in concert, and my wondering was answered. Styx doesn't have any good new stuff because their heart and soul is gone (Dennis). There's no one left in Styx with any original music talent.This album clearly illustrates the lack of originality. I couldn't imagine that Dennis would have ever put his name to something this bad."
1,Worst Styx Album ever,Do not take it even if it is free. To bad I counld not give ) stars. 1 star is to good for it.
2,good but not good enough,"i am a orthomolecular-nutritionist and i treat many add\adhd children and a lot of what is suggested here in this book is true,but as far as the mother\father of the add\adhd children is concern this book gives to the parent only general pieces of information without an organised conclusive treatment program(even that we know that it should be monitored with a nutritionist\doctor).vitamin b3 does not damage the liver only to those who already been damaged by medicines\or other poisions.the book of dr.allan cott:dr.cott's help for your learning disabled chid is the best book, after it is :dr. hoffer's abc natural nutrition for children by:abram hoffer and the book of marcia zimmerman:the add nutrition solution. the book of dr.cott is a divine book"
1,Stay Away...,"JUNK, really really junky junk. ok that sounded stupid, i know, but hey, its true. Please take my advice and DONT BUY...and if 4 some reason you do, don't say I didnt warn you..."
1,disappointintg,"This is a special edition of the Metal Hammer video magazine published (I believe) *before* Donnington '92. I think the intention was to promote the Iron Maiden's appearance in the event. I bought it under the impression that it would contain the actual footage of Donnington '92, but it doesn't. Instead, there's a short interview with every member of IM talking about their past performance at Donnington and how excited they are about playing in '92. You won't learn anything new or interesting.There are also interviews with some other participants in Donnington '92, such as Megadeth, Dio, WASP, a couple more. There are also a couple of videos. Nothing really exciting.To summarize, watching this video is mostly a waste of time."
4,Light and entertaining,Fun to read but very light entertainment. A good book for the beach but don't expect to remember it after you have finished.
5,Lou Bega - you suck. This is the Euro-tune of the Millenium!,"This song didn't top the European charts for week after week for nothing. This is an excellent song from those Euro-dance masters that keeps the dancefloors pumping into the night. No matter how many times I listen to this, I can't get over how great this song is....repeated listenings only make me appreciate it that much more. I am not familiar with anything else Shaft has done, but this is undoubtedly gonna be their high-point - if you love Euro-dance/pop, don't miss this one!"
1,"Negative, cynical & pessimistic junk!","As an owner/professional in a hospitality business I HOPED to find some lessons and guidance in this book...I found a burned out husband/wife team who could do nothing more than share miserable annecdotes. No positive lessons, no gainfull knowledge, no advantage from experience. If you want to be talked out of owning a restaurant, or any other small business, this is the book for you. Just don't judge your fellow man too harshly, after reading this book you'll have little faith in the goodness, the potential or the opportunity in business and people."
5,Excellent,"This CD is fantastic. The emotion filled music grabs you and pulls you in. I don't speak Spanish but can read some of the French text and I find Zoe Valdes' writing to be engaging and thoughtful, with wonderful depth. I suggest you buy this CD, it will pluck at the strings of your heart and give you more."
2,"Good idea, bad implementation; book is full of errors","This book is a good idea, and offers a good set of overall strategies for doing well on the GMAT, but it is full of errors, particularly in the math sections. For example, the formula that it gives for calculating the number of permutations of a set of objects (which it strongly suggests that you memorize!) is just plain incorrect. There are also errors in a number of the sample math problems; for example, in a sample problem concerning standard deviations, the demonstration of solving the problem starts off by saying ""since you know that there are 100 fish..."", but nowhere was that stated in the problem.If you're a math whiz already, and can spot and work around these errors, this is a great book for giving you an overall test strategy. If you're trying to learn the math from this book, though, beware... If it weren't for the math errors, I would give this book 4 or 5 stars; however, such errors in a test prep book are unforgiveable."
5,Old Favorite,"Marshall Tucker is an old favorite, if you like ML. Reminds me of learning my first guitar solos from Toy Caldwell"
3,Getting better.,This is superior to the first in the series and does have some interesting ideas and charactors but Jean Rabe hasnt pulled it off as so many other authers could have.
4,Day of The tempest,"This book is likley to satasfy you even more than the one preceding it, The Dawning of a New Age, though not as good as the book following it ,The Eve of the Malestrom. I recomend this book highly and know any of the people reading this would enjoy every word."
3,Machete Jr,"I just purchased the Machete jr from Academy Sports and Outdoors for $17.99. I know I could have gotten it cheaper online, but it was an impulse buy.I have been using a full sized cheap machete from SportsmansGuide.com which I purchased for %7.00 a couple of years ago. I did not like the handle on the cheap one, but it does have a full tang.The Gerber machete has a better handle, but only a little bit of a tang.I guess I will keep the old machete too.The Jr will be good for cutting watermelons and other melons with one whack and it does look cooler then the cheap one with the tape around the handle."
1,"NOT PAN AND SCAN , AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","What is wrong with MGM/UA ????? THIS WAS A PANAVISION FILM. THE LASERDISC WAS RELEASED IN LETTERBOX WITH THE OVERTURE. WHY IS THE DVD IN PAN AND SCAN, WITH THE OVERTURE CUT ?????? STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. TRY TO LOCATE A COPY OF THE LASERDISC VERSION. IT SEEMS THAT MGM/UA USED TO GO ALL OUT ON LASERDISC, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DVD, THEY SHORT CHANGE US !!!!!!! BAD CALL, MGM/UA!!"
1,"<font color=""pink""size=6>All Saints, can u spell LOSER?",i expected the album to be good pop like the spice girls but the album SUCKED! they sound sooooo much like TLC and they cant sing! the only good songs are never ever and if you want to party! f*** u all saints!
2,Yuck!,I think that this whole group is overrated. I do not understand why people can like songs where all the group members do is talk over insrumental music. I have never heard a song that was that bad.
5,good girl band,"I loved the spice girls in the 90's but they were for the masses. All Saints appealed more to the r&b/hip hop fans and they were successful for a minute. I Know Where It's At was a hip hop/pop song that had the janet jackson sound to it, but with a british vibe to it. Never Ever was a beautiful, beautiful ballad that was on heavy rotation and who can forget the remakes of under the bridge from the peppers and the labelle remake of voulez vous couchez avec moi ces't soir. I hope shanzay does a solo career cause she wrote most of the lyrics and music on this album and it would be nice if she made a solo comeback cause the group broke up and it doesn't look like they're getting back together"
2,It Sucked! I wish I wouldn't have bought it!,"A Total Waste of my money! if you like one of their songs then just but the single, don't waste your money! The only song that I liked off of it was ""never ever""!"
3,"Okay, but edited to pieces.","I first saw 'Hurricane on Sesame Street' when it aired on my local PBS station. It was very well done and took place over the course of five episodes.I was, at first, thrilled to hear that it was going to be put on DVD. And I thought, ""Wonderful. The entire show on DVD!""They edited out too much of it for me to enjoy it. It was edited down to roughly 50 minutes. They took out several parts. Such as the cleanup of Sesame Street. Telly making an odd shaped X on his window, worrying while the hurricane raged. Big Bird sleeping in the apartment. The stories to help Big Bird fall asleep. And Granny Bird telling Big Bird his nest needed ""The Final Twig."" All these were missing from the DVD.I understand that some editing was needed. But it could have been done better.It would still be good for the younger kids, however. Who may or may not remember the week long show in it's entirety."
3,Maybe not for little kids...,"This is a more issue-oriented ""Sesame Street"" episode, showing step by step what it's like to be in a hurricane... Yay, just in time for global warming!Anyway, this might be too scary or anxiety-provoking for really little kids, and maybe not of that much interest to families not living in hurricane-prone areas. The title is a little misleading: theme of friendship is secondary to the bigger issue of the hurricane, although everyone does band together and help each other out. Good demonstration of community values, but not the most pleasant or enjoyable ""Sesame"" adventure.PS - the new, post-Jim Henson voice for Kermit The Frog is just terrible. Maybe they should have retired the character."
3,Decent Blues Artist with a Unique Style,"James ""Blood"" Ulmer is a great guitar player, but only a decent Blues artist. He is mainly known for jazz guitar and experimental music. ""Geechee Joe"" and ""Where Did All The Girls Come From"" are very enjoyable, and Ulmer certainly has his own style of singing. The only artist whose vocals are anything like those of Ulmer is John Lee Hooker. ""Sittin' On Top Of The World"" is very well done. This is modern Blues, to be sure, and doesn't resemble Patton or Robert Johnson in the slightest way. Still, if you are looking for something unique, and are a musician yourself, you might appreciate this record more than I do. Ulmer performs ""Sittin' On Top Of The World"" on the ""Lightnin' In A Bottle"" dvd and does an excellent job, by the way."
2,Over hyped,"I really can't understand the rave reviews given this recording. This type of material has been covered much more effectively by others (especially John Lee Hooker} The guitar playing is uninspired and the lyrics are nothing special. IF this were recorded by an unknown , it would be totally ignored.In fact this sounds at times like an out-take release. His earlier recordings are far superior."
2,7 Minute DVD!,"Minimates are nowhere as durable as Lego minifigures, despite their close appearance to them. AND....the DVD is only 7 minutes long! The description of the item leaves this interesting fact out. It takes longer to find the movie and get it in the player than it does to watch it. My son was very disappointed. And so was I."
5,Excellent Beginner Tutorial!,"I just finished with the Essentials of Dreamweaver 3.0 by Kevin Siegel. What an appropriate title. I found the lessons to be just what I needed to get up and running with Dreamweaver.What impressed me most was how the lessons were layed out in a seamless fashion. And the section on animation was a blast to complete.As advertised, I finished in a few days. Can't wait to see Siegel's advanced book."
2,Huh?,How can a contemporary book about Dreamweaver ship with a floppy disk instead of a cross platform CD? What a disappointment! I would just assume the author knows that many design studios do not use the old floppy drive.
3,Christian melodic hard rock,"Crystavox debuted in 1990 with this self-titled release. The Christian band had a relatively heavy, very melodic, rock sound that was somewhere between Whitecross and Barren Cross, which I suppose means they sound like Dokken. There are some metallic aspects of the band's sound, but they're more a melodic rock band than anything else.Lyrically, Crystavox tends towards the more evangelical end of the spectrum. Unlike Stryper or Guardian, whose message was often open to interpretation, Crystavox is unambiguously Christian in nature, which has the potential to alienate any non-Christian rock fans who might otherwise enjoy the band's sound. Sometimes you just don't want a Sunday school lesson in the middle of your rock & roll songs.Crystavox issued one more album - 1992's Bottom Line - before calling it quits. Their debut is a perfectly decent melodic rock album, but unless you're a serious Christian rock collector, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to track it down."
2,Too general,"Hi bought this manual because another reviewer said that it had detailed information. I found it to be very general. For example, when replacing valve cover gaskets and upper intake (plenum) gaskets, i found better instructions and guidance for free on web forums. This manual has less than a page of instructions and very high-level. Whereas I found about 20 pages of details without photos on web forums. Oh well, time will tell whether this manual is of any use."
1,Aerogarden kit,"Ipurchased the kit on line and it took three weeks plus to receive it. After completely assembling and getting it ready to go, I plugged it in and the one grow bulb burned out. Thinking well I have everything ready to go - so I have to get it started. I called the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store and fortunately they had the replacement bulbs. After returning from the store, I tried to insert the bulbs but they did not fit securely into the sockets. The next day after multiple attempts to reach customer service, I received no assistance from them at all. They were not only not helpful but rude. So I packaged everything up and returned the unit. I had to pay for the returning shipping as well. I am still very interested in the aerogarden. I was looking forward to fresh herbs. When I returned the bulbs to BB and B, the clerk was very understanding and she said they would have stood behind the whole thing. So if I do purchase another unit, it will be local at the BBandB."
1,broken after 30 minutes!,"My son opened this truck a few hours ago for his birthday. Within 20 minutes, the crane part was broken. The plastic parts are already stretched out and broken. VERY disappointed!"
4,A funky Finger 11,"Obviously, I got the CD because I love Finger 11 and wanted to hear their previous incarnation. The first thing that struck me is just how funky Letters from Chutney is. Featuring many bottom-heavy riffs so much a part of Finger 11's later sound, there is a surprising number of wah-pedals and syncopated rhythms. The formula works really well, making for songs that are just as danceable as they are moshable. The performance is solid and stands as a testament to just how talented a band they are.Think of it as party Finger 11."
4,A little too 'out there' for me,"I was really wanting to love this dvd, having bought Hemalayaa\s Yoga for Urban Living and really enjoying it. I just couldn't get into any of the three sections, though. I am very interested in the whole idea of Ayurveda living and finding balance in your life, but I just didn't seem to enjoy this dvd much.There was a lot of chanting of ""om"", ""rum"" and ""shreem"", and I'm not much of a chanter, I guess. ALso, I thought there were some strange postures, like balancing on the balls of your feet in a squat position and then jumping, which I wasn't really able to do well. Two of the sections were supposed to be 'calming' but I didn't find that to be true, for me. I like Hemalayaa Behl's other dvd and would recommend a beginner try it first before trying Dosha Yoga."
5,All time favorite Yoga DVD,"I have been using this DVD for years and I LOVE it! There are four different workouts, about 20 minutes each. You can do one or any combination of them. It is beautifully recorded, the music is great, and the actual yoga is not dumbed down , nor is it so complicated that a normal human cannot do it. It is challenging, yet accessible. The combination of yoga and aryuveda is phenomenal! Go online and find out your dosha before you workout for the best personal balance. The section of the dvd on aryuvedic living is truly informative and inspired me to try new beneficial therapies. Hemalaya is lovely to workout with."
1,More Homedics Junk,1. The raised plastic bumps under the feet are painful. My feet felt worse after use of this product than before.2. The infrared heat is worthless...barely gets slightly above room temperature.3. What was I thinking buying this?Update---The bubbles failed and the foot controlledswitch sparked...I threw it out! BEWARE.
1,BEWARE!,"I am highly skeptical of the data behind most of this book. The figures seem consistently wrong. I doubt a single set of data could give the #s shown in both Table 4.2 & Chart 4.5. I find it funny that in Charts 7.1 & 7.2, 2 managers have tremendously different gross returns, but seemingly the exact same set of monthly returns. Funny again, in Charts 8.1 & 8.2, ""Best"" & ""Random"" managers seem to have the exact same results. Are the errors in proof-reading, concept, or facts?"
4,Good book with a very narrow focus,"This book will be useful for the money manager interested in choosing among the growing universe of hedge funds. Despite some overmethodical and occasionally dubious measurement techniques (much is made of the mysterious-sounding ""d ratio"", which is simply the ratio of winning months to losing months), Lavinio does provide some useful tools for evaluating the past performance and future prospects of different hedge funds.The only disappointment is that Lavinio tends to treat hedge funds as mysterious black boxes, scrutinizing their results without any real attention to their methods. The lay reader will probably find little to satisfy his/her curiosity."
2,Lacks Depth of Coverage,"I read this book in about an hour, it is vey simplistic in the analisis and its conclusion or based on assumptions that can never be applied to hedge funds, specialy his survivorship analysis. I have read about 10 books in hedge funds, I find this the least helpful."
1,Horrendous/Hilarious,"This is not a good exercise video. It is very difficult to follow, and Ms. Powers continuously makes very strange and distracting comments (ex. this is your head, that thing that is attached to your neck...)I can't really even begin to explain how bizarre this tape is. That being said, it is really funny, and if you have some dance experience you might even be able to follow it.The most significant problem I had with it was that while the instructors were demonstrating footwork it would film them from the waist up, leaving you completely puzzled, while the bizarre participants and their hooping and moaning (?) would send me into convulsive laughter and I would miss all of the instruction..."
3,"very usable, standard tellings","Fables are always good to use with children, starting from very young! Even older ""kids"" can often get something out of reading the fables to the youngsters!"
1,Lasted A little over two years,I loved my Fugi camera. I had bought it when digital cameras were at their peek craze and 3.2 mp's was really cool. Unfortunately I naively thought the camera was of top quality and that I would not need to sign up for the four-year warrantee/service plan. I was disappointed when on my study abroad trip the camera's zoom lens got stuck outside of the camera. When I returned home (now without any pictures) they told me it would cost around $100 to fix the stupid thing. I decided to buy a different brand digital camera with the 4-year service plan!
5,Great Camera!,"This is my 3rd digital camera and I couldn't be happier. The last two were both Olympus.Pro's: Small and lightweight, fast reaction time loading images on LCD, fast reaction when turning cam on and off, very simple to use, built-in flash (as opposed to flip up), and new XD card technology. The complaints about the ""cheap plastic"" feel really don't bother me since I prefer to have a lightweight camera.Cons: No sound on video, fast battery drainage (get rechargeables)."
5,A Great Camera for a Great Price,"I had been trying to decide whether to buy this camera or the Canon Powershot S230, and decided on this one - I think that I made the best decision. For about $100 less, you get much of the same features, and, in my opinion, overall better picture quality than the Canon. We took this camera to the zoo this weekend, and the picture quality - richness of true color, was amazing - such impressive results from such a small camera. The added plus was that it was easy to use, and conveniently small enough to fit right into my purse. The only negative I would say is the shutter lag, and not being able to record sound in the movie mode. But I am so happy with everything else that it doesn't matter. This was definitely a smart purchase."
5,Great Camera!,"I'm not a photography expert. Wanted a camera to take pictures of my children. I purchased this camera after much searching on the net and reading of magazine reviews. My local camera shop strongly recommended it. It is very easy to use, pictures are clear, sharp, and easily downloaded to your PC. Friends and family are amazed at the pictures and prints (from shutterfly.com) developed from the camera. (8x10 are unbelievable) The only downside I can see is slight red-eye in some photos..which is easily removed with software programs.My wife (who hates cameras) even learned how to use in 2 minutes! You won't be disappointed."
1,Intermittent problems,This wireless router is flaky. It will work for a while and then stop accepting new wireless connections for no apparent reason.I have the lastest firmware (Nov 2006) and use WPA/WPA2 with long passphrases. I also tried various settings (such as wireless B/G only) to no avail. The relatives that use this unit at their home are very frustrated.
4,Much better than Linksys in my experience.,"I am surprised at all the negative reviews about this router. I have had some dropped connections but far less than when I was using a Linksys router and the signal (range) on the netgear is much better. I am only in a 1000 sq ft apartment but couldn't get reception with the Linksys at one end of the apartment, with the Netgear it is not a problem at all. Set up was easy and I have been happily using it for about 9 months now."
1,NETGEAR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE!!,"I WILL JUST TELL YOU THIS, NETGEAR ROUTERS ARE THE WORST, ALWAYS GOING DOWN, BUT THAT IS NOT THE BAD PART!! THE BAD PART IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! JUST TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND YOUR NAME TAKES AN ACT OF GOD!, THEN HOURS ON THE PHONE...THEN YOU CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE AND YOU PAY 30.00 FOR ADVANCED SUPPORT!! NEVER AGAIN NETGEAR, AND BY THE WAY IF ANY OF YOU WANT MY OLD ROUTERS FROM NETGEAR EMAIL ME AND I WILL SEND THEM TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE!!"
5,Very Sweet,"I liked this book very much. I love every Girl Talk book I have ever read. I am still trying to find more books. Well, this book was interesting. It was about Katie Campbell and her friends volunteering for a youth program. Katie, her crush, Scottie Silver, and her stepbrother, Michel, are teaching young kids the basics of playing ice hockey. Katie is looking forward to the team's first scrimage, but she ends up in the hospital due to a serious health problem."
5,Great deal on a good product!,"I couldn't have asked for a better price and faster shipping on a good product! Plus, I thought I was only getting 3 brush heads, and there were 4! Great deal!"
2,Oral B replacement Heads,"Purchased these items a few weeks ago. Already one head has fallen off and the second one is coming loose! These are somehow sub-standard or didn't pass quality control. They look original, but aren't up to the normal standard of replacement heads I have previously purchased."
1,SELLER SOLD DEFECTIVE BRUSHHEADS WITHOUT DISCLOSURE!,"I thought the first defective brush head was a fluke, but when I started using the second, and then the third, it was obvious that this package was defective. Bristles slowly fell out. From the beginning, one or two bristles fall out with each use and often get wedged between my teeth. These brush heads were sold as new, but should had honestly been sold as ""New and DEFECTIVE"". The seller has not contacted me but I suspect that they knew they were defective when they obtained them. For the first time in my very long and active Amazon history, I think I was ""ripped off"". Since it took a few months to realize all the brush heads were like this, it's likely too late to get my money back."
5,OUTSTANDING,"This very personal memoir reveals a side of Linda Chavez that even her longtime admirers probably haven't seen before. She is of course a brilliant lady--a sharp observer of culture and politics. Here we learn how a working-class Hispanic girl made an unexpected journey from dingy apartments in New Mexico and Colorado to the corridors of power in Washington. The story is gripping and the prose is excellent. She provides an inside look at her failed nomination as labor secretary, but the bulk of the book is about her family life and unrelated professional episodes (teaching at UCLA, working as a Democratic and union activist in the 1970s, becoming a ""Reagan Democrat,"" and so on). Fans of Chavez won't want to miss it."
1,Worst soccer ball I have ever had!!,Worst soccer ball I have ever had!! Ball started peeling from the first day it was used. I would never will buy this brand again
4,Pretty decent ball,I got this ball from a friend. Truth is that it is a very different soccer ball not only because it is orange but in general it just feels different. Nonetheless I would say it is a very decent ball.
5,Will replace your 35 mm film camera,"This is my second digital. This is by far the best. This takes pictures that look like a 35 mm. It is easy on batteries. In two months with moderate use, I have replaced the batteries only once. After seeing the quality of prints, I have finally sold my 35 mm which I loved dearly. The only downside is that the display is all digital. Through the viewfinder it is digital. Otherwise, easy to use and understand and works with XP. Love it!"
1,Horrible Digital Camera,"The camera I bought from this seller had a button broken on it and two seconds after I turned on the camera the camera turned off and it now smells like it's burnt. Something might have happened through the shipping proccess, but I talked to the seller and he is not working with me to refund the product.I'll never buy another camera from here again."
1,fujifinepix3800,"This camera needs to be recalled as it just stopped working. I liked it originally, but would not buy a Fuji product now. My daughter's Fuji stopped working too. She has a different model.Fujifilm FinePix 3800 3MP Digital Camera w/ 6x Optical Zoom"
1,"Great , UNTIL it stops working after 2 years!!","I bought this camera 2-1/2 years ago and it was a great camera until recently. After owning the camera with no problems for 2 years, the screen now goes black half the time when you want to take a picture. We have to fiddle with it hoping the screen will come back on and allow us to take a picture. It is really annoying! You expect a camera to last longer than 2 or 2-1/2 years. I would NOT buy this camera again. It is a piece of junk!"
4,"Fujii 3800, nice camera but there's room for improvement.","Out of all of the digital camera's I've owned (3), this one is by far the best. I guess I should just be content, especially for the price, but I wish they would improve on the Autofocus when shooting under dim lighting. Half the time the pictures come out in focus, even though the out of focus indicator is lit. I would also like to see a version that actually allows you to set the shutter speed manually. The manual mode lets you indicate whether or not you want to use a fast or slow shutter speed but doesn't allow you to set the actual shutter speed you want to use."
2,Factory Seconds!!!!,"I've had this set for years and love it, so when I broke a bowl and bought a few to add to the set I was shocked. AMAZON IS SELLING SECONDS AS IF THEY'RE REGULAR DISHWARE!!The set is ivory with rust colored highlights. The bowls that I recieved are, if fact, ivory, but the rust is either on part of the bowl (bottom only) or not at all. The highlights are supposed to be irregular, but not only on the bottom of the bowl.If you have the set these will not match. If you just want a pretty, sturdy, off-white bowl it's great."
2,This book runs a fine line between really bad & okay ref.,"I was extremely disapointed after viewing this book. The illustrations are so bad, it's hard to look past it to see the clothing design. I wish the author would have hired an experienced fashion illustrator to compose the drawings in a sketching style of the time...1960's. I do have to give the author credit for the layout of the design progression per year. The book did contain many design references/illustrations for accessores. This is rare, as there are not many accessory design referece books.last words; Okay reference for the 60's era of clothing & accessory design resource, but horrific illustration!!!m donat fashion designer"
3,Red print ink inside ..,This book is with red print ink and it does not contain a lot of information. It is not a book for professionals . Can be usefull for student.
5,One of a kind,"Roy Orbison is surrounded by a cast of fans who are musical stars in their own right, and the result is magic. Classics like Only The Lonely and Dream Baby never sounded so good. The finale of Pretty Woman is one you'll crank up and listen to over and over. It doesn't hurt to have Roy's timeless voice with backup singers like K.D. Land, Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes. Add to that Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello and Tom Waits having a blast playing along and this musical Dream Team scores a slam dunk. Buy this DVD and turn it up! You gotta believe Roy's smilin' down at us. Thanks Roy."
5,Clsssic Orbiion - One of a Kind!,"This is classic Roy Orbisson, rich, clear, hauntingly beautiful and soulfull; don't miss your opportunity to watch and own this DVD. Loved seeing Roy's entourage and friends playing and singing along with him. Elvis Costello was great, as were Jennifer Warnes, Bonnie Raitt and K. D. Lang doing background vocals. The ""boss"" Bruce Springsteen tried to steal the show, but it was Roy who was, and always will be the star. Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Tom Waits, J D Souther all jammin' with the man.....how cool is that? Can't say enough about this DVD. What are you waiting for? Buy it!"
5,Epic,"A friend suggested I watch the DVD and was hooked. Growing up, I wasn't much of an Orbison fan, but this has changed my opinion. The concert with Springsteen,Bonnie Raitt, KD Lang, Elvis Costello, T Bone Burnett and more icons, can't be matched."
5,Best Artists Ever!,"This is the best DVD of all time. What a great artist Roy Orbison was and everyone wanted to perform with him. Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, KD Lang, Bruce Springsteen -- many more great artists. I played the DVD at a party for my friends and they all loved it. Just like being there at the nightclub."
5,Loved it from start to finish,"I have enjoyed Roy Orbison's music for years. The black and white only adds to the magic of this performance. This is timeless music which can enjoyed over and over on this DVD. The other musicians (Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Glenn Hardin) play backup and let the man do his work. How we miss Roy Orbison!"
1,roy orbison dvd,"this dvd was not as expected. you watch this dvd but no sound!!! you have to put the cd that comes with it in order to hear it. do not buy this here. instead, have block buster order it for you."
1,Live or ...,"I will disagree with everyone else on the planet on this one and I do like Roy Orbison.As good as the band was there should have been more sparks in this DVD rather than almost none. The sparks that were there seemed to me almost scripted.I got the distinct impression that the set was completely re-recorded. If that was the case all blemishes can be removed. Now, of course, with that line up one would hardly think that there would be a mistake. So we might not know what happened during the filming, afterwards or, in this case, how much happened afterwards.Yes, the sound was great but all films go in for a mix and one would hope that the director and music producer would take the time needed to make this one sound good.So yes it was/is a historic film but it does, at least for me, raise a few questions."
5,Re-living Roy Orbison,I saw this on PBS. Just HAD to have it. Thought I would be arrested for noise pollution when I received it. Have watched it over & over & over. Just can't get enough of it.
5,A TRUE TIME CAPSULE,"I've watched this concert 20-30 times, and never get tired of it. Roy Orbison and this incredible band and chorus of singing legends and musicians, created a concert to be enjoyed for generatrions to come.Music lovers of today's generation may not get it or even like it, but for me, it will always be a favorite.The HDDVD version for me, gives me widescreen version not before available, and that makes it all the better. I'm not sure that the actual video in black and white, plus the fact that many scenes are filmed to make it look old, are improved that much for HD. That being said, just being widescreen makes it worth owning this concert..."
5,Roy Orbison Black & White Night,"I put in the video and pull out the pool cues. I love the energy that comes from the performers as they pay tribute to Roy. Its a great video and I love to listen to the performance while playing pool. I highly reccomend this to anyone, the audio is very well done. Enjoy"
4,For those with seriously dry lips...,"Yes, this product is thick. In the winter, my lips will crack, and the thickness coats and protects the area until it can heal. It also keeps my lips from drying out while I sleep."
2,Its ok,Its Not good recording at all . I wish it was 1080 almost Looks like its not real. Poor picture qulity
5,Oral B Extra Soft Brush Heads,I am very happy with this product and the service and timeliness in receiving it. This is the only site where I have been able to find this product as it is not available in the stores in my area.
4,Works,"I like these brush heads better than some of the other styles for the Oral-B, and, really, they all clean about the same. Just watch for the sales, because prices can vary tremendously for the same item."
4,a must have,if you purchase the electric toothbrush you dont have a choice but to buy the heads none come with the product curious to see how long they last so far so good
2,I can't use it,"I ordered this product from Australia to be used in Australia. No where in the description of the item did it mention the type of power needed to charge the toothbrush nor were there options on the order form. I would have liked to know what plug type and what power was needed. When I wrote to ask if I could use my converter plug and 2540v power, I was referred to Oral B, who referred me to Proctor and Gamble who referred me back to Amazon. No where on the outside of the box it came in are plug or power mentioned. The instructions are in French and English so I assumed it would work when I opened it up. My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I was excited Amazon had it, it's supposed to be good."
3,review Oral-B Sensitive,"The first shipment is sort (3) brushes, I sent an email to request. Few days later, I received the short. I was not confident about this company."
4,expensive for a reason,"Yes, this is expensive, relative to the other Oral B brushheads. Why? 1) You're paying for Disney's licensing fees, just like for all the other Disney products made for kids (and adults.) 2) It costs a little more to manufacture the feathered bristles they use for this brush head. If you're not familiar with what that is, look closely at the ""business end"" of the bristles and compare them to the adult Oral B brush heads.It's also possible that because they sell fewer of these, they have to spread their fixed costs among fewer units sold. But that's only a guess."
2,"Classic Raspberries, Dreadful Audio","The 5 star reviews posted by others are on target music-wise,The audio, however, is another thing all together.First it's mono. Now I'm a big fan of mono in some circumstances: for the pre-1960s recordings for which mono was the format of choice (or necessity before stereo releases existed) or for the collectors among us who want both the stereo and mono in the days when both were offered.Secondly - even if one is OK with the mono mix of these albums - the audio is dreadful. It sounds as if RPM used third generation tapes rather than the original master. ""Muffled"" doesn't begin to describe how bad this CD sounds.Still, if this release is the only way to acquire these classic tracks, then go for it. Otherwise, look for CDs with better audio."
3,Could have been so much better,"As the first campaign setting I ever played in was loosely based on the African-like Chult, I thought this would be a cool book. However, the writers dropped the ball on this one. The new characters races are just renamed rehashs. He dismisses the classic classes and instead make new classes that could have easily been simple modifications of pre-existing classes.The main asset to this book is new feats, clerical spheres, and monsters, but they do not make this book worth the full price. This is a bargain bin buy, nothing else."
4,Must-have for work-out,"If you have clix, then this is a must-have accessory for work-out or activities. Very secure, light, and stable...Only thing is that the screen is not protected, which still makes sense considering the security of the case, visible screen size and the weight.Neck strap is kindda worthless because it doesn't hold the case as strong as the arm band. When it's on the neck, the carrying case is too bulky. The carrying case is good for arm band or on hand.It's very easy to put the Clix in the carrying case and take out."
4,One of those C.D.'s,"This is on of those albums that make you say""I can't beleive I'm actually buying this!!"" But after listening to it ad letting the nastalgia wash over you, you say ""I am so glad I bought this!!"""
2,not as magical as it was in the 70s,"this was my introduction to beatles music. it is a product of its day, and was magical at the time it was released, but it certainly didn't hold up well. i guess the bee gees are not the gold standard they once were."
4,a true memento from the 70's,"This album was a gift to my dad's from my mother on their wedding anniversary way back when it first came out. Then, in 1983, I did damaged it, I recorded music on top of it. My dad's was hurting a lot, he really liked the album. From that year on I always looked for a way to replace it. I asked many friendsto see if I could recorded from them with no luck. Just a couple of months ago I found it here and I am soo glad i did. My dad's keeps playing this CD every saturday and when I ask him why he likes it soo much, he answered: I just like to remember my youth and the times back when my generation was on top. Go figure!"
5,Had to give it 5 Stars!,"I know it's silly but I have loved this album since it came out when I was six years old and my friends and I used to run around pretending to be Strawberry Fields. Embarrassing memories aside, I have to say that I have been waiting years for this to be released on disc and am thrilled to find it AND THE VIDEO here at amazon.com."
1,The single worst record of all time,"It is unbelievable that this abomination is once again available. It is my sincerest hope that everyone involved with this project die a horrible, painful death. I saw the movie as a teenager over 20 years ago and it still ranks as one of my life's worst experiences. This detestible piece of garbage should never been allowed to happen let alone be allowed to rise again from the muck. This marked the lowest point of the 1970's which is saying a great deal. Stay away."
1,Pice of junk,"Most of the songs are worth skipping, and there is barely a hand full of songs worth listing to. If you are stupid enough to buy this album, get reddy to start skipping songs."
1,Don't bother if you use mac os x,"I have had nightmares with the driver for this machine. At first I thought a virus was slowing down my imac to near crashes (in os x? Never before.) I even got an Apple technician out, who ended up replacing the motherboard. Then a crash course in terminal later and I was able to determine that it was in fact ""Lexmark X73"" process that was eating up anything between 70-99% of cpu every three seconds. Everytime I use the thing (or open a program that thinks I might need it) I have to remember to open terminal and run ""top"" before being able to ""kill"" whatever process number it has. This takes ages especially when the cpu is being strangled so much. I tried to use the Lexmark online support and got a very rude and sarcastic response. It has wasted a huge amount of my time and isn't even particularly good at either printing or scanning."
4,kindle ed cd question,If I buy it. is there is a chance to download the audio files?. Thanks .I dont Want to miss the Cd examples
3,Product Photo is completely misleading,"These are in no way yellow, and the product photo is false advertising.I'm really disappointed that a company like Avery wouldn't have this more locked down. We should be able to order in colors as specific as Pantone numbers."
3,"Savage & Stevens Arms: Collector's History, 5th Edition","It's a nice book but I expected more than reprints of old catalogue pages. There was some history but a lot of repetition and no values or real information on how to distinguish one model from another. Also, I own several Stevens shotguns and there was no information on those at all."
1,not the best of either,I was very dissapointed. It seems this was just a c d for both of themto just make some money .It trully was not there best and most of the songs were on a nother c d I have that was suppose to be there best ugh
1,Oral-B; Price- TooGood To Be True,"I had the same results as others who reviewed this product. When using the first head, the insides pulled out when I pulled it from the brushing unit. The second head lasted a few weeks before a small piece behind the brush broke and rendered the brush relatively motionless. I am on the third head with hopes it will last longer."
1,not worth the money,"Bought a 3 pack of these brush heads and the first one I used broke the first time I used it, the 2nd a week later and the third lasted a while longer but was on the verge of breaking for about a month. I didn't buy this product from Amazon but I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing because I feel like I basically paid $30 for one months use of a toothbrush!"
2,Oral B Brushheads from Germany,I purchased these brushheads from Health Beauty and Beyond. The first day the first brush head fell apart. The merchant contacted the manufacter and advised that they would send a new brushhead and a return label to send the fauly merchantise back. I recieved a new single replacement brushhead but no return label to send the rest of the brushheads back for replacements. The merchant did the right thing but the manufacturer is not the greatest. I am still stuck with nine useless brushheads. The product seemed to be old stock and brittle.
1,AVOID THIS RIP-OFF!!!,These appear to be after-market replacements manufactured in Ireland for the european market. They are totally inferior to the real thing available at 3 for $21.00 in American drug stores. The brushing heads quickly become loose and the body slips on the metal shaft of the toothbrush base. Pinching lips is another wonderful feature. Some prices are too good to be true. This fake item is nowhere near the quality of real replacement heads available to you locally. Avoid this rip-off. Shame on Amazon for presenting this product to the unwary public!!!
1,Faulty and Dangerous,This is not a bargain. The brushes are cheaply made and quickly develop a gap between the brushing head and the head retainer. The gap can pinch (has pinched my lip) your lip and bruise it.
5,Excellent service,"Received the packet right away. When I discovered it was missing a unit, I emailed the seller, and they corrected the mistake by sending me another packet. Really pleased with the service!"
1,Poor quality replacement bruch heads,"These brush heads were obviously defective or counterfeit. As noted in other reviews, each quickly became loose and started pinching my lips. A week or two later the little metal pin would fall out and the whole thing would fall apart in my mouth. Other than the German-language packaging they appear identical to what's found in retail stores."
1,bad quality,"did not last long , all broke after a few days of use , so i bought the ones imported and those are great , but the ones i bought through this seller were the worst quality ever , they should not let them sell this bad product anymore !!!!!!!!"
5,great product,"I had trouble finding replacement brushes, till I found these. They're great, just like the name brand ones, work great!! Can't tell the difference, except these are better priced."
5,BEST OF THE BEST,There is no better toothbrush than this. It does the job and last longer then others too.
1,Weird counterfeit,"Vibrates, doesn't spin, head loosens and pinches, one lasts about a week, wouldn't be surprised to discover it it was leaching metals or toxics."
1,Initial OralB purchase,"The first two replacement heads exploded at the back of the plastic head and a little metal pin dislodged in my mouth while I was brushing. Yesterday (12/15/08,) I spoke to a rep. at Amazon.com and they were going to contact the manufacturer and get a replacement pack shipped to me. They said they have not experienced this problem before. As long as the second shipment is fine, I'm okay with this purchase. I do appreciate the personal phone call from the Amazon.com tech.Rick Brandt"
2,Short on Space for additional items,"Bag gets very stretched if you try to carry normal notebook accessories plus some... chargers, digital camera, a file or two, etc. - for basic notebook carry only."
5,Traitors Among Us,I got it for my husband and he loves it as he knows so many of the people in it.He also knows the author!
3,Flawed but good,"I've enjoyed reading this book. However, the author describes nearly every subordinate, co-worker, and superior with a repetive set of complimentary adjectives. The net result of this is a rather ""smarmy"" tone. Surely Colonel Herrington had a few bosses that he hated, co-workers he thought were difficult, and sub-standard subordinates?The second criticizm is that he has scenes in the book which are more or less told from SFC Conrad's point of view. Yet since Conrad did not cooperate with the author (my impression is that he kept his mouth shut until he died), these scenes have to amount to ""faction."" Yet they aren't identified as such.Nevertheless, it is still a good story and one that I, as a former Army intelligence officer, enjoyed reading."
1,Parts cannot be dishwashed!,"Initially I thought the machine was great, and the first two uses I had the time to handwash. The third use, I threw the parts in the dishwasher, not thinking anything of it since they looked like stainless metal, well, big mistake. The shiny finish washed off, underneath is a horrible lead-like metal that leaves a black residue on your hands, towel, anything it touches, it smells like iron. All the parts turned grey like this and furthmore, the discs all started rusting. I am so angry, what a waste of money. I wanted to grind my own meat so I could buy various cuts of meat to make specialty dishes. I particularly needed the course grind. It's destroyed, rusty all over. I don't even want to touch it, let alone grind meat with it. I don't know what the warranty is, I'll post and update when I hear back from the manfacturer."
4,Works Great ....but,"I purchased this interchangeable ball system when I installed a new hitch onto my truck. I had previously used the Master Lock interchangeable ball system on my truck's bumper hitch but the shank was too corroded to be removed and reinstalled onto the draw bar. Changing the balls has always been quick and easy. The only problem I ran into is that the second kit I bought contains the 2 5/16"" ball that does not fit onto the kit that comes with the 1 7/8"" & 2"" balls. The shaft that comes in the kit containing the 2 5/16"" ball is longer then the one that comes with the kit that contains the 1 7/8"" and 2"" balls. However, the 1 7/8"" and 2"" balls that come in either kit are identical and will work on either shaft. Therefore, if you ever think you might need a 2 5/16"" ball save yourself some hassle and buy the kit that contains all 3 balls."
3,Not really all that small!,"This seems like a nice umbrella, but be sure to pay attention to the dimensions listed. It's over a foot long when fully collapsed. I purchased this for my wife but it's way to big to fit in her purse! The descriptions says compact, and ""super mini,"" so I just assumed it would fit. Nope. It's actually pretty big for a ""small"" collapsible."
4,Beautiful umbrella,I bought this for a Cristmas gift for a long time friend that is difficult to shop for. She loved it.
3,"Nice sized umbrella, but hard to close","I love the umbrella. It is nice and cheery on rainy days. It opens quickly, to a very good size. I have a hard time closing it though."
1,Looking For A Good Read?,"If you're looking for a good read, then look elsewhere. Not only is the characterization weak, but this is a Blaze that barely sizzles."
1,Maybe back in 1999 it was hot but now it only sputters,"""Indecisive, aren't we? Well, I think I want to tell you anyway."" That's kind of how this book goes. Celia is quite the wimp, trying to stand on her own two feet but struggling. Alec is quite happy telling her what to do - even Angel tells him to lay off the bullying.About the only interesting thing is the backstory. Human trafficing is still a huge problem and this book address some of the ways that young women get lured into bad situations."
2,"Love it, but required altering @ the shoe repair","This shoe fit excellent in the length. But the leather across the foot was so large I had to have it taken in at my shoe repair, about $30. And they took it in too much so every time I wear the shoe I have to soak it with leather stretch to get my foot in and then they are okay for the day. However, it's good leather that usually snaps back, and it's winter now so I've only worn them once or twice. Maybe next year the stretch will settle in? This was the unfortunate case w/ all 3 Dr. Scholl thong sandals I purchased. GREAT prices on sale. Fit did not work for me at all."
1,Something's Fishy Here...,Note how all of the 5-Star evaluations were all posted between November 23-25. Looks like the company has posted its own raving reviews about its product.
2,Not a good choice,"This course was my first attempt to learn Chinese. I was not very successful. The dialogue is not very interesting and my retention was not very good.I find Pimsleur to be far superior and mucn more expensive. My retention is much better and my Chinese friends are impressed.Chinese is not an easy language for English speakers, so multiple sources are good. Right now I'm still using this course. (it is nice having a text along with the audio. Wrting Chinese is a whole other hurdle. The accompanying text uses Pinyin which I feel is a good choice. Pinyin is Mainland China's attempt to improve literacy in China. It allows you to learn how to pronounce the words. Chinese characters are no help in this area."
3,I only bothered to play it a few times.,"The menu drove me (pun intended) crazy! You have to click through five or six menus just to race! Then you have to wait for the game to load... Forget it. I played this on a Core 2 Quad 6600, with GTX 285 and still could not max it out..."
1,Didn't work!,"I tried installing this game on my computer, and it would only show me the intro video segment, and the launcher would not work. I tried the suggested uninstall and reinstall, and still it would not launch. Lame. It looked nice from the video intro and the effects it went through while installing looked like fun (I saw 7 arctic tracks go by, and some fog features)- too bad I never got to see them for real!And I do have a brand new computer with the expensive 8600 video card, so i know my system should be able to handle it."
1,I Agree - Its Worthless,"I also have a PC with more than the necessary hardware requirements, and the game simply doesn't work properly. I was unable to access all the menus, couldn't access the cars, couldn't choose the racing modes, and the controller would fail to function properly even after adjusting all the settings. I suggest looking at other options."
3,"GREAT book, but unfortunately, more rehashing by Bill Breeze","A Great book indeed! But do we need a new revision every time Bill Breeze wants to make more money off of Crowley's name? The book is a must have, just wish they would get a ""final"" copy once and for all... afterall the book was writen over 60 years ago!"
3,Not my cup of tea but maybe yours.,I didn't like the adult humor nor the violent scenes. But the story is ok. It is more of a guy movie.
5,I love Franklin spanish-english dictionary,"This Franklin BES-2019 Speaking Spanish-English dictionary card is very good.When you purchase, make sure it is speaking type. There are other types out there without any pronunciation."
4,One year later....,"After buying and trying several others, I've been using this keyboard for a year. It's worked just fine....and I can actually feel the keystroke (unlike some of the ""sleek"" keyboards available). It would really be great if it was also illuminated, but with just a low intensity LED desk light, it gets the job done! If it eventually breaks, I'll just buy another."
5,Love This,I think this is a really great item. Numbers are super easy to see if you have eye problems or just like the wake up happy color.
4,"Fast shipping, boxed very well, works great",My dad needed this keyboard really bad. He seems to love it and now he can navigate the computer again. Thanks for the great service and fast shipping.
3,Okay Performance,"I bought this for a relative whose eyesight is worsening. It helped her significantly, but the layout of the ""Enter"" key is odd. It's smaller than most keyboards, and the user tends to hit the backslash key instead of the enter key.Over time, the user would probably get used to this."
3,"Ok, but not great","I purchased this ""book"" about a year ago. I put ""book"" in quotations, because it is really a binding of typewritten pages that are copied and put together. Rearding personal information, I would rate the book a ZERO, as my personal family information is incorrect for the three generations I know about. I gave it a three, however, because it has a LOT of information going back much further -- information I'm hoping is correct. I found the information relates stronger to the Ruff lineage than Robertsoon."
2,Blah,everyone plays real well but the guitar player doesnt seem to have his own style or tone. a shame because he wrote some really good tunes here.lavitz wasserman & sipe shine as always but cant quite save this disc.
2,What's with the Tiny Screen Size!,"I have a Franklin's SCD-1870, and have purchased 3 dictionary bookman cards for it--German, Italian, and Spanish (speaking). Out of these 3 expansion cards, this Spanish card is the worst (the German one has the best features & tools)--other than that it's a limited version, all the available text is readable only in a tiny 3/8 inch by 1 3/4 inch rectangle, which leaves more than 2/3 of useable screen blank. In addition, even though I was initially excited about having another ""speaking"" dictionary card, this card's ""speech"" is not as clear as the English dictionary ""speak"" function on my SCD-1870.Although I like the convenience of expansion cards, I can't help but feel rather disappointed/cheated by the Spanish (speaking) bookman card, as I'm made to forever scroll up and down every nanosecond..."
1,Do NOT buy this from here!,WARNING!!!!!!!! Do not buy this from Amazon.com! The use J&R Music World to ship this item and charge over $40.00! Go the Franklin.com and get the same item for $19.95!
5,"wonderful, easy product.","had this product for a few years now. It was great for writing and reading spanish papers, and was invaluable when I went to Spain. Works flawlessly with the other franklin products."
5,Help Bending the Mind,"I like these puzzles because they are really a learning and teaching experience. I do what I can of a puzzle and then check the answers to complete it or to get me ""unstuck"". Some of the puzzles are real headaches, but I find when I go back to easier and bigger puzzles, I am so much better at them for having struggled with the Tough stuff. I am so glad for them."
3,lots of stuff by SPEDDING,"just exactly how many cd's does chris have???don't ask me, for a guy who basicly only had british hits,(i'm amazed)but thats ok cause some of this stuff is rockingly good, another one to get is GUITAR GRAFFITI, ASOME GREAT PICKIN LICKS and theres one calledCLICK CLACK, not very expensive iethr. your // review master// DANNY WAGNER adiosamigos"
4,"Motorola HT820 - Great Stereo, OK phone headset","For music playback, this headset is great. Sound quality is rich and full, volume is fine, battery life works great for me. It effectively covers office noises. I also love the fact that this headset handles both music playback and being a headset for my phone. Unfortunately, while the sound is fine for the headset portion, others on my calls consistently report that I sound very quiet and am hard to hear. I like a phone headset that doesn't require me to speak up much more than I would if holding a phone handset, and with this headset I have to speak forcefully for others to hear me well. For this reason I consider the HT820 to be a great stereo headset, but as a phone headset it's just OK."
1,Not for laptop use.,"My laptop is bluetooth compatible and I was hoping to use this headset for listening to music and gaming. However, the headset was horrible. Aside from an awkward interface that only worked when programs were opened after the headset was connect, there was about a 300ms delay in sound (which was very annoying). It cut out sound a LOT. Trying to communicate using online communications software was nearly impossible as I was missing half of the conversation. I think this headset was made specifically for phones only. Though they advertise it for computer use, I would not recommend it."
5,Great Ear Phone,Motorola HT820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset with Charger - 89014JThis is an awesome product. The shipping was fast.
4,"Nice for stereo, great for the phone","The audio quality is the best of any phone headset that I've ever used, but don't sell your audiophile-quality wired headphones just yet. They work great with the phone (LG Fusic), or with the laptop, but seem to get confused if you try both at the same time. For example, receiving a phone call while listening to music from the laptop often ends in a lost call for me. But using MP3s on the phone, or just the laptop without the phone, they work just great. The battery life is longer than my ability to wear them.They're reasonably comfortable, and they have seemed to get more comfortable with more frequent use. They're big and funny looking on your head. Not a fashion statement, not easily mistaken for earmuffs with a huge pulsing luminous blue M on each ear, just funny looking."
1,Junk,Stay away from these skillets. They aren't even flat on the bottom and are impossible to cook anything correctly. For the price I should have known better.
3,Value for money. Not less not more.,"The 3 skillets are very flimsy. But for 5$ it was a deal.The 12"" one was received out of shape."
4,Whittington,"Whittington, a Newbery Honor book, is the story of a cat who comes to live in a barnyard of down-and-out animals given a home by Bernie who with his wife cares for Abby and Ben, his orphaned grandchildren. The cat Whittington is the namesake of Dick Whittington, a London merchant and advocate for the poor during the mid 1300's. As Whittington tells the barnyard menagerie of his ancestor who was the companion of Dick Whittington we also find that Ben is struggling from the embarrassment and problems of dyslexia. Ben's struggles are interwoven with Whittington's storytelling. While this is a good story which imparts history and science through the words of the animals, the transition from real time to storytelling does not always flow well. The accounts of the merchant trade slows the story down at times and seems rather textbook-like. Until the very end, the characters lack the three-dimensionality that allows the reader to empathize with them. An enjoyable read nontheless."
1,Product does not match description,I ordered this lock because I wanted a black & silver lock as depicted in the photo. Instead I was shipped a black & yellow lock. Beware.
4,Masterful insight into Magick,It's pretty amazing to me to be able to see the rituals presented here. This is stuff that you would have to be very hush hush about not too very long ago. Enlightening glimpse into the world of magick.
5,Another Great Insight into the PRACTICE of Magic,"The difference between an Occultist and a Magician - is practice. Messers Runyon and Jednack and the Ordo Templi Astarte have once again allowed us a peak into their world of magical practice. Thabion's words are wise, the solstice ceremony shown in the video is inspiring and the silent eucharist celebration is meditative and thought provoking. The music, although magical and true, gets a bit tedious to the viewer (although I'm sure it adds well to the actual ritual events depicted).The beauty of Mr. Runyon's video offerings is that they allow students and practioners alike, insight into a well established and practicing magical temple. They show actual ritual work...something not usually readily accessible to a student of the magical arts, which will (hopefully) inspire the armchair occultist to get off the couch and into circle!"
2,Just not worth it,"Ok, I'll admit this is SOME different than the ShaniaTwain and Faith Hill rubbish that seems to rule femalemusic these days. However, coming out as the femaleKid Rock doesn't really feel original. The album isabout either rebelling or crying about cheating.Nothing we haven't heard before folks. It's in mostevery genre and it's rather old.When I first heard ""Redneck Woman"" I thought theDixie Chicks had went through ANOTHER personalitychange... But no, we get some 31 year old women(who for some reason thinks she looks good) rantingon and on about how she's happy to be from thetrailor park. But I guess like her fellow rebel flagcarriers she has got used to the fact that herculture full of losing. I guess it's great that sheis a good loser.Just can't stomach her Dixie Chicks meets Kid Rocktype of personality."
3,Not as good as I expected after I heard all the hits,"It was ok i guess. But not much more to mention. Ya. So anyway, the hits like Redneck Woman and Here for The Party are much better"
1,didnt care for this one much,to me know song country or not should ever have cursing in it being a Christian I would not Recommend Gretchen Wilson to anyone because there should never be cursing in any song it just isnt right very distasteful
2,Gimme a break,"Mary Gauthier,Iris Dement, Lucinda Williams, Maggie Brown, Allison Moorer, Stacey Earle, Jenny Whitely, Audrey Auld, Kasey Chambers; these are the real ladies of outlaw, and authentic country/roots music, not this fabricated 'bad' girl. Country music is in rough shape and the excec's are just tryin'to get it back on track by giving mainstream a rougher version of these other tarts infesting the airwaves. I give her credit for doing her thing, but don't even try to call this music anything other than what it is, plastic country/pop. If music producers really wanted authentic 'country' they wouldn't have to look at this lady, there's plenty of the above mentioned that have been around for a while."
5,Great Western!,"This was a terrific western novel! Written by David Robbins, this novel tells of 4 young cowboys who get into a heap of trouble in Dodge city after a cattle drive. All the characters are different and plenty colorful. David Robbin's writing style has been a great addition for Ralph Compton fans. This is the second one I've read by him, and I can't decide which I love most. I hope he continues to write more westerns."
3,Only 1 problem...,"I am used to buying devotionals with bookmarks sewn in. This one does not contain any book marks for marking the pages. Otherwise, I am satisfied with it."
2,Start your day right,"As much as my faith has carried me through good times and bad, this book only make me understand why I do not believe you need a building to praise God. I rarely read this book now - instead of it uplifting my spirits it appears to preach at you. I know how important scripture is - and the scripture at the top of the page is great, but instead of writing insightfulness throughout the page, this author just quotes scripture, anyone can do go through the bible and pick out scripture. I truly disappointed. A much better book is written by Doreen Virtue, her Daily Guidance from your Angels."
1,"bad writing, and boring","this book was written so badley, and became so on going that, I could bearly stand reading it"
1,Motorola charger,Do not buy a generic charger for a motorola phone. It will not work. When I plug it in it says unauthorized charger.
1,bit,"Drill bit is a very good one and does the job well, but the pictures are not even close to what they look like at all."
3,Where to get the latest firmware update!,"Goto this Yahoo Group below to get the lastest goodies about this PVP404 unit. Like the hard to find firmware updates.. Join the group and stick around!http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GoVideoPVP4040/CONS: the battery life needs to be improved, but folks are already on the case locating cheaper battery alternatives to the Govideo OEM battery..F."
5,Franklin Rocks!,"Terrific concordance, quick and thorough search, ease in usage, terrific viewability, excellent overall product (*Fabulous Price as well*)"
1,Be careful how you read reviews on this book,"I bought this book based on a previous review (5 stars) expecting it to be very helpful for my co-workers. This book is geared to a complete novice and is in actuallity a workbook to teach Word's basic skills to users with very little computer experience. If you are at all familiar with Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, this book will be useless to you. The previous reviewer must have been a novice user, otherwise I can see no justification in giving 5 stars to such a short and basic instructional volume."
2,This book only features rough sketches...,"Look closely at the cover of this book. It is filled only with such rough sketches of the day, evening, and sports wear from the decade. This is not a detailed, pattern-oriented fashion book. Rather, it would serve better as a reference guide for a designer looking for inspiration from classic styles."
3,"Better than ""Up the Line""","I might have gone for three and a half stars - or four - if the editor had not written little self-love introductions to each story. At one point Malzberg claims that Silverberg's ""Up The Line"" might be the best time-travel story ever written, so I picked it up used from Amazon. What a trite piece of trash it was.Buy this book if you're hooked on time-travel and don't need much new to keep you going, or if you need any excuse to keep from vacuuming your abode."
4,Beautiful prose in The Journey Home,"I read The Journey Home several years ago with my book club. I found the prose lyrical and descriptive and could visualize the details...the scenery, landscapes,butterflies and food. At times, it read as a journal which is a style I enjoy reading and can connect with. Disa, the main character, was a strong woman who endured much and grew as a person throughout it all. The ending touched my heart as a mother. It is a bittersweet ending in which I shed a few tears. I could relate to the depth a mother has for her son. I found the time period covered during the war in Germany and time of the Holocaust was written accurately and respectfully."
2,Expectations,I am starting to see why people hate critics. Some groups like the Go-Betweens get unconditional love. This album was praised to the ends of the universe. Come on. The catchiest song is about rain. They also sing sbout ghosts. This is after the year 2000 and those beliefs give me the impression the members of the band have a first grade education. Are they going to sing about santa claus or the easter bunny next. This is a mediocre album in all respects. Get Echo & The Bunnymens' Reverberation. They sing about ridiculous subjects with a wink of the eye. They deliver it with energizing music. The critics hated it.
3,Be aware of its quality,"I bought four ViewSonic VA1912WB Widescreen LCD's not long ago, from CompUSA online, for my company. After two weeks, one of them went bad, the screen showing a kind of bright grey tone, as if it was in an e-coma. Called ViewSonic and was told it might be an inverter problem. Sent it back at my own expense, at ViewSonic's unfair insistance. Received it back today. Not sure how long it (together with the other three) will last. I have one 17-inch Dell LCD and two 19-inch Acer LCD's at home. The Dell is 4-5 years old and the Acers are about one year old. Never heard of two-week-premature demise before until this ViewSonic proved that how much more I need to learn out there.In case ViewSonic has been watching customer posting like this, my serial number is QBN070270372, and I welcome your getting in touch with me if you wish, to update me on your quality control to back up your name image."
2,"Good Monitor, TERRIBLE customer service","Purchased this monitor 2 years ago and now have issues with it. It is still under warranty, so this should be easy! Afraid not. Customer service says No advance replacement after the 1st year, you have to PAY for one of their add on plans for that. You ship it back to them and they will repair it and then send it back. You get to pay shipping, you have to wait 7 - 10 days minimum from the time they get it for repair and then wait for it to ship back. Total time gone: 4+ weeks. And what are we supposed to do for a monitor in the meantime? What packaging do you use if you do not have the original box. Can honestly say that after dealing with their terrible customer service, I will never buy Viewsonic again. Planar and Samsung have GREAT customer service. We purchased a Samsung to replace this monitor and when it comes back, will verify that it works and then give it to the kids to play with until it dies again."
4,Good overview,"The author does a good job of discussing the basic material in PM, in addition to spicing up the content with real-world examples and a nice, honest tone in monologue. A good addition to any PM's library."
4,"Sturdy, but heavy","It is a quality lock. Like the rubberized outside and the cover for the key hole. I dont like the weight and the caution you have to take to make sure the key is all the way in, otherwise it wont unlock/lock.CSS"
2,Lock good / Holder and Warranty bad,"The lock works fine and is very intimidating. My suggestion is to by an extra cable to go with it, so you can keep both wheels safe.The part that ataches to your bike and holds the lock is a piece of garbage. The lock does not slide into the holder easily, and the way it attches to the bike guarenttees it slides around while you are riding.The lock big sell is that in case your bike is stolen you will recieve compensation if they break thru the lock. What they do not say is you need to jump thru a whole bunch of loops to be covered (You have 7 days to fillout the paper work, take the bike to bike dealer and have them give you an estimate, and return all the papers to Kryptonite)Overall I am not a big fan of the lock, but cable locks will not cut it anymore (especially since thevies can cut thru them easily.)"
1,Absolutely useless lock in NY...and any larger city,"I had higher expectations for this lock. It seemed sturdy enough, certainly formidable looking and not one I would think could be easily broken. The company touts it's credits without hesitation. Well, I went into a store yesterday and within less than 5 minutes I came out to see a thief making off with my bike that had been responsibly locked with an Evolution Series 4 lock from Kryptonite. Just curious, I checked youtube this morning to see if there were any videos about this lock and there were plenty. It's incredibly easy to pick the lock...in seconds!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Very secure lock,Cant see anybody hacksawing or crowbaring this baby open. Have not had my locksmith friend see how pickable it is. Three kes are included which is a bonus and one even has a light for evening visibility if you should require it.The trade off is that this lock is heavy which for those of us who have carbon alloy frames and bikes you could lift with your pinky it kind of destroys the purpose. On the other hand I have ridden thru some rough neighborhoods and a bod on the head with this lock attached to the chain I also carry to lock my rims up would render a would be theif unconscious. All in all I am very happy with this lock and it's security value on my very expensive bike.
4,Solid Lock - Kind of Frustrating,"Pro:- solid lock- long/wide enough to easily lock bike to most objects- attaches to bike for transport- comes with multiple keys- has little door over lock to keep debris outCons:- It is often a pain to take it on/off things because of serious friction inside the mechanism that the prongs go into. I've made this better by lubing the action with bike chain oil, but its messy and I have to reapply about every 3-4 weeks. (I live in a pretty damp location)- I think they just raised the price - I could have SWORE that I bought it for $50 a couple months ago...- The keys and actual lock action can be an IMMENSE pain. It seems like at anytime when it is especially inconvenient (pouring rain, late to class) the key will go into the lock about half way and it will take about 10 min of praying, cursing, and fiddling to get it to go in to lock or unlock.I'd buy it again (not for $67) but be prepared to be frustrated at times."
3,sort of miscast,"Mr Hughes did a very good job, but there just was not enough pathos in this movie. A Christmas movie, unless it's a farce like National Lampoon, should make you feel emotion throughout. Sadly, this movie did not.make me feel much. I feel it was somewhat miscast in Gerald McRaney."
5,A Hobo's Xmas,"A warm and charming story (just as i remembered when it was first on television) that i was surprised has not been seen more on television. Well worth the time spent watching it, not to mention the money spent to get it. A True American Classic!"
3,Battery Design Fragile,"While I have appreciated the mobility and range of the LKA10 Headset, the delicate plastic hinges that attach the battery to the headset dialing box have proven to be very fragile if the unit slips from your clothing and falls or is bumped. A 3' tumble onto carpet from my desk or hip pocket that doesn't harm my mobile phone has completely shattered this integral connection piece making the unit unusable until I purchased another replacement battery unit. So far I've bought three over a two year period - well before any of the batteries showed any sign of wearing down.To me this is a hidden cost due to a design flaw that reduces the LKA10 & CS10 Cordless Headsets' value significantly for me."
3,A couple of great songs and a good bit of filler,"Two really great songs on this album (Right Here and Bye Bye Pride) but for the most part I did not find this album to live up to the hype that I've heard about the Go-Betweens......I will definitely buy another album, however....maybe Liberty Belle or 1978-90.....too bad its an import and very expensive"
2,"Good info, but outdated",The info was very easy to understand and was pretty much up to date. The only problem was that the websites where CORRUPT! If your ok with that; this is the book for you!
5,THIS is definitely the book to buy,"I got Photoshop Elements 3 along with a book and fumbled around in a frustrated fashion for about a month. Then I went on a cruise where they offered 4 classes. I took them and someone recommended Scott Kelby's book. When I got home I ordered it from Amazon - it arrived 2 days later and now I'm really on a roll. I've organized my photos, renamed them so they make sense, made digital backups that I can understand and burned CD's that play on the DVD player. All this in less than a week! There are pictures of the screen so you can find exactly what is described in the text. The book is written so you don't have to be a techie to understand it! I'm ready to go further with improving my photos but so far, just the organization is paying off big time. Get this book. You'll be glad you did! Penny"
3,buy it else where,if you buy it at barnes and nobles it come with a free instruction dvd..not at amazon.com
3,Didn't fill my needs or answer my questions.,"I bought this book as a 1 stop tutor to PSE 3.0. I used it as a major reference in an on-line photo course for DSLR photography. I was highly disappointed. I found many steps incomplete and many questions unanswered or even referenced. Basic PSE3.0 titles were not indexed for reference and followup when problems encountered while working in PSE3.0 Organizer, Creator, or Editor."
3,Basic,These are very basic life jackets. They are small. I would only purchase for bigger children or very small adults. Not a good option for regular adults.
2,"Anecdotal, Self-Promoting, and Manipulative Trainer","Regarding working with colleagues, author's advice sounds an awful lot like it treads and/or crosses the line into unlawful and unethical conduct. One of several examples: He says to refer clients to loan officers, and to seek their referrals in turn. I believe that to be specifically outlined as an unlawful kickback in California.I picked this book up at the library, and am hugely grateful I didn't pay for it. ""Dirk"" the author talks a lot about how great he is, tells a lot of stories that are not particularly insightful or useful, and he seems to be using this book as a platform to sell other products to hopeful real estate agents.Finally, the techniques/scripts he prescribes for client conversations are manipulative and a little creepy.All that said, there is some useful information in the book. And I'll admit there are plenty of real estate agents out there that reap huge financial rewards by being underhanded and pompous."
1,Not For Outdoor Use,"I bought this hoist from Grizzly and initially it worked great. This hoist was mounted under a carport outdoors. After a couple of weeks without using it, I went to do a job where the hoist would be useful. I went to hit the down button and I got no response. I checked all the wiring and deduced it was the motor. I took the motor apart and found that moisture had got into the motor housing and seized the motor core. I was able to free it and re-greased all of the gears and sealed the seems. Put it all back together and the motor worked great again. This time I covered the motor with a protective housing and two weeks later it was froze again. I called Grizzly and they basically told me they would fix it but it probably would keep happening again and they had no specifications on humidity or moisture tolerances.I would not recommend this product if you live in Florida or any other humid region."
4,Scholarly piece for Little House lovers,"This is a collection of essays which are well-researched. It is quite scholarly, however, rather than a leisure read. A good addition for Little House collectors."
5,This book talks about the history surrounding LIW's life,I think this book is very interesting and very informative. I am a huge LIW fan and I think that any fan of her books would definately enjoy this biography on her life.I also believe that anyone who doesn't believe that she really exsited should also read this book as well.
5,tinkys ride,"I can't give a reveiw as of yet, this is a toy purchased for a Christmas, so as of yet. It is not even out of the box."
2,Agree with other poster about EToys,"I ordered a Green Machine from EToys as well and when it arrived the box was trashed and it was missing two pieces. Of course we did not realize this until Christmas Eve when we went to assemble it. EToys was willing to pick it up and return it but Huffy is sending us the replacement pieces free. We haven't been able to ride this toy but I still have high hopes for it, but I wouldn't order anything from EToys again."
4,"Great Bike, but I expected more","The bike is nice, very fast, but the back tires are made of plastic, so is not that strong as I was expecting, my son loves to play with it, and the bicycle does not pedal in reverse."
1,very basic machine,"I received the product but to few days to use for my son it started to lose the nuts to the big wheels and the nuts to the center of the body, in this moment my son don't use because it hasn't de nuts. I'm impressioned because in less to the month this toy failed.Rgds.,Jorge Adonis"
4,A quite fan,"This is a quite fan with a huge heat sink. Easy to install, it tookabout 15 min. to complete. The heat sink is so large that it just mightkeep the cpu cool without the fan. A good bargin in my opinion."
5,Works Great.,"Although I think the seller should be more descriptive in the item page, the product shipped fast and works perfectly.The cable is in no way distorted when using the RF swtich, and the picture comes out fine. It works for my GCN/Xbox, I don't have a PS1/2 to try it out with."
2,This is a really good book to read on the beach,"I got this book while I was staying with family in D.C. It is a good book to read while on vacation because it's not very deep. However, the constant references to alcohol (that portrayed drinking in a positive light) and hook-ups made me a little bit uneasy. Also, the writing is not very good at all. Nice, fluffy plot, but really pretty trashy."
5,* * Best Book I've Ever Read ... * *,South Beach is the best book I ever read it. When I first saw it I thought it was a big copy off of Cecily Von Ziegesar Gossip Girl series. I read the book and it was not like any other book I've read. Its better than gossip girl and its ending had a twist. I recommend you read this!
2,hoyle classic collection 2006,"Not real happy, since it was suppose to be 2006, turned out to be a 2005 which I already had. Did not realize until I had opened it and set it up"
2,"Good ideas, but poorly written.","This book had a lot of interesting ideas, but it also had many flaws. It purports to be an introduction to the area of cultural history, but the essays assume the readers have a certain amount of knowledge. Beyond that, it is also poorly written. As a 3rd-year history/English major, I often had some trouble following the arguments this volume made. The authors could have articulated themselves much better. I have to say, the area of cultural history is fascinating, but I would like to think that there are clearer volumes out there."
5,great watch,"i brougt this watch for a friends b-day, and i seen the same watch in macy's for $100 , it was a really good deal, way 2 go amazon."
2,A bit too technical,"I was expecting more of a hands-on book than this. A great book for understanding how amplifiers work, which is very interesting. This book is a great first book to read if you'd like to make your own amp some day."
3,Horse Nation,"If for no other reason, get this for the Death Cult version of""Horse Nation,"" since this version is at a slightly quicker tempoand has more of an edge than the version on the first album by TheCult, DREAMTIME. Death Cult's ""Ghost Dance"" is also very good,and an early version of ""Rider in the Snow"" (listed as ""TooYoung""), destined for the DREAMTIME album, is very interesting withentirely different lyrics (much like some of The Sisters of Mercy'searly versions of songs were)."
4,Watch Review,"The watch itself is beautiful! I got this as a gift for Christmas which I have been wanting for awhile now. However, one needs to know before buying that it does not come with a watch battery. I had to go to a watch store and buy a battery for it and get it sized which did cost $15.00. However, with the low price of this watch which does not sell for this price in any of the other stores, it still is worth it to purchase online here. It also arrived very quickly after ordering which was very nice as well!"
1,Worst Book of the Year,I bought this book based on the glowing reviews and it makes me wonder what redeeming qualities those other reviewers saw in this book. I guess the plot would be credible with a 13 year old but I can't imagine how anyone could find this book entertaining and Lydia a sympathetic heroine. How could any savvy businessman put $3 million in a checking account? Why would a man about to retire put this amount of money into capital renovations for a hair salon? At what point was he expecting to see a return on his investment? Everyone is so pathetic in this book that it was hardly worth finishing. Do yourself a favor--DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK!
2,The romance was too contemporary for me,"If you like romances that end with everything tied up in a nice bow (I like to know that they lived happily ever after--that's what I read romances for), then don't bother with this one. I was not convinced that the hero was Irish (the author seemed to be trying too hard). The story has potential, but I don't think that it paid out."
3,He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not,"This was an okay summer read...if you've already read everything else that you had picked out to read. The story is fun and a little bit interesting, but how many times can you do the whole love/hate thing in one book!Lydia Gold goes on vacation with her boyfriend Abe Bohemius. He supposedly dies in a diving accident and the dive instructor, Liam McNally, goes in to find Abe or his body. The two are thrown together in this semi-mystery. They are continuously hot and cold with each other while they are figuring out what they want out of a relationship. Their dance of will they or won't they got to be pretty old by the time the book ended. It could have redeemed itself by ending with a fairy tale ending...but they still continued the dance.Read it, but don't have too high of expectations."
1,"Really, really bad.","WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS.This book looked great--I'm always up for an ""evil house"" book, cliched as they may be. However, as other reviewers here have pointed out, the cover image, plot summary, and even the title of this atrocity are misleading. The multiple grammatical and proofreading errors are annoying, but not nearly as dismal as the story itself. The plot ends with a cult, in an underground cave, summoning their goddess to receive her human sacrifices. The goddess has feathers and a beak...in my mind, a giant chicken. She sucks people's brains out of their heads, which apparently makes a popping noise and causes their skulls to deflate. Really. This sounds delightfully cheesy, but unfortunately it's not even laughable. Really, really painful."
3,"Tries, and at times succeeds.","Sephera Giron, House of Pain (Leisure, 2001)Before you read the book, just open to the back cover and stare at Ms. Giron's photo. Erm, wow.Now that that's out of the way, on to the book itself. (But you can allow yourself to go back between chapters and stare some more.) I'm not exactly sure how to describe House of Pain. It certainly starts off with a bang, but then it kind of deflates (as if having its brain sucked out by one of the villains). The haunted-house premise is always a great one, and it's got some twists on it here that are, while not wholly original, at least not horribly overutilized enough to have appeared in, say, a Barbara Michaels novel. But by the last fifty pages or so, I was saying to myself ""didn't I see this in an old Louis Gossett, Jr., movie?"" way too many times. (And it wasn't a horror movie.)Worth it for the first two-thirds of the book, but be prepared for something of a letdown. **"
2,A raging bore,"Japan: A System That Soured is a pretty useless book. Katz, a very so-so journalist cum economist, spends ages getting to two very simple conclusions. One, economies which grow quickly in the early stages of development slow down when they reach maturity. Two, Japan cannot grow any faster over the longer term unless its economy is liberalised and its markets thrown open to competition. My goodness. Really? Whatever made you think that..."
1,Poor image quality - not for me,"I really like the form factor of this camera, because it's quite small and has some very nice attachment options (laptop clip and desktop monitor mount). Unfortunately I found that the image quality left quite a bit to be desired. Even at 320 x 240 resolution, there is extremely noticeable aliasing of straight lines, and the overall picture quality is very grainy. In addition, this camera performs extremely poorly in low-light conditions, much worse than the older Xirlink IBM PC Camera (no longer produced as far as I know) which I am currently using. Finally, the focusing feature seems to be a poor joke at best, with hardly any noticeable difference made before and after attempting to focus it. Or at least that's how it appeared, through all the graininess."
3,Not much new here,"This volume is interchangeable with any number of of other sociological tomes. The author tries to depict a cross section of aging customers, some human slaves working in debt bondage after being sold (often by their parents) to a brothel.some of the helping organizations-but it doesn't hold together very well as a book unless you have been living on another planet of late. The inclusion of sex in the title is somewhat misleading as this could just as easily be about poor Pakistanis in slavery to brick kilns."
2,"Good suspense story, poor transfer","The file features the services of many fine actors, and is worth seeing. The transfer by Alpha Video (oldies.com) is very poor and looks like it was transferred from a poor VHS copy. In addition to many scratches and jumpiness it has excessive noise with not very good resolution. The CD does play just fine. The packaging is very nice and may be worth the price if low enough, but it is wasted on the quality of the CD. I have a much better VHS copy from Sinister Cinema, but unfortunately it is not currently in their catalog."
5,Great,My almost 5 year old is getting this for his birthday in a few days. He loves Star Wars and has many of the other figures but we couldn't find Darth Maul in any stores around here so Thank You Amazon! He's been requesting this so I'm sure it will be a big hit.
1,Inaccurate - do not buy,"I purchased 4 of these tapes (right and left reading) over the past 5 years but recently noticed that the latest was inaccurate. The problem is that the inch markings are not an inch apart. Some are larger and some smaller and some exactly one inch. This prompted me to go back and check the other 3 that I purchased earlier and they all have the same problem. The inaccuracies often cancel out within a few inches but I now understand why my cuts were slightly off; I used to think it was pilot error but now I can guess that some were due to the inaccuracy of these tapes.Ultimately, I was able to buy adhesive tape measures from Oregon Rule Co. [..] that are accurate and precise."
2,Thorough but biased view of the disease,"I bought this book when I was first diagnosed with Graves Disease. It provides a great deal of information, but the section on personal stories does not provide a wide enough view of treatment options. Every story detailing a certain treatment ended badly and there was nothing good to say about it. The book is generally biased against specific treatments, so I do not feel it tells the whole story."
2,Need a translator,"I am disappointed in this book mainly because it is so technical and hard to read. The reviews made it sound like it was easy to read, that is one of the reasons I bought it. But, even with a bachelors of science degree, I am having a very hard time getting much out of it. Being thorough is one thing, but it reads like a medical text book with no explanations. If you are in medical school or a practicing physician, you may be able to understand this, but sadly for me, it is way over my head."
2,Fine for kids but otherwise annoying,I bought these radios for my daughter for Christmas. The price was right considering she was using them outside in our back yard. Only get about 45 minutes to an hour of usage before they need charged again. The life of the charge is definitely less than I expected.
2,"well, they do work","Bought this pair to go with another set of earlier models we have.What a waste of time and money. Uniden should be ashamed of themselves!Oh, they work just fine, but the rechargable battery life is ABISMAL!(sp?)After less than four hours of hanging on my belt, with all of ten minutes of transmit time, the ""low battery"" warning beep goes off, and the battery gauge shows ""all gone""!.The older set we use will last thru a ten hour shift, no problemo!Ah well, live and learn eh?"
1,Disappointing!,"These radios are a disappointment! The batteries do not last through a 10 hour day, and I am reviewing the ones that come with the rechargeable battery pack and chargers. They last longer with rechargeable batteries, but then why did I pay for the battery packs and rechargers? Don't waste your money. If you can get the radios without the battery packs and chargers at a discount, then maybe go with them. Otherwise, don't buy them!"
4,Two way radio.,The grandkids love it for talking to us from their play house in the back yard. We like it when communicating from the fuse box at one end of our ranch style house to the other where we are working on electric switches.
1,didn't care for this movie at all,I really like Terrance Hill and that is why I bought this movie but I didn't care for this at all . It is way too stupid.
3,It's really not a star ratings type movie- but it's good,"We purchased the movie because we enjoyed the Trinity series so much. The movie has three really enjoyable scenes that made the purchase really worth it. However much of the movie was filled with bizzare and slow moving scenes that at times made the movie trying. My thoughts are purchase the movie, watch it at some time when you really don't want to think about anything else, enjoy the good scenes, and take the rest for what it is. The movie is child friendly and could be watched in a family setting."
1,Watch Out We're Mad,"This movie was so bad that we will never watch it again. It's going to the Goodwill.I'm mad that we paid $22 for it. Trinity movies are funny, this was just plain bad, it was hard to get to the end."
3,"Great band, Great songs, Poor recordings","I love Bauhaus don't get me wrong, but the live recordings though energetic, are of lackluster quality. If you're just getting into Bauhaus I'd wait to buy this album til you're accustomed to them & know what they're suppost to sound like. If I were you I'd start by purchesing: Mask, or The Skys Gone Out. Press Eject & Give Me the Tape almost lead me to leave Bauhaus behind."
2,high speed but not beautiful photos,"I am satisfied with its speed of 150x. However, sth happened that the photos is not as beautiful as other slower speed"
2,Re-recordings from K-Tel,"If you're looking for the originals- look elsewhere- these are re-recordings by the original artists. The only original on the cd is ""Six Days On The Road"" by Dudley.The re-recording of Dean's Mother's Day"" classic ""IOU"" is quite good and pretty darn close to the original. I purchased this cd for less than 5 bucks here on amazon so I aint complaining. Just wanted to let you guys know that these are re-recordings and it states so on the back of the cd."
4,whoosh & drone & beats...,"Essentially this is a collection of remixes of songs from Bowery Electric's excellent album 'Beat'. Beautiful sonic reconstructions from the likes of Witchman, Third Eye Foundation, and Twisted Science build on Bowery's whoosh & drone & beats sound."
5,"Got more edge than most ""electronic"" records","I got into Recoil because I am a big fan of Alan Wilder's work for Depeche Mode. I find his Recoil project to have the same great sense of sound, samples, and just a perfect balance of creativity. There are no singers on this cd but what you will get is one of the best mood records of the 80s. This album is unforgettable like a secret you don't want to tell....."
3,This wasn't a good idea but there are bright spots,Apart from the laughable Republica version of and the fair PWIS & good Orb remixes this record has little to offer. Go back to the classic Numan like 'replicas' unless you have a fav band that you must collect all remixes by...
2,Disappointing,"I have been a Numan fan since Replicas. I could only listen to a few tracks on this tribute more than once. (Poetry and Power is the best track IMHO, We are Glass, I Die You Die, Are Friends Electric). Made me realize how good Numan's arrangements are. The atmosphere on most of the tracks is lost, as is any instrumental complexity. Get Numan originals."
3,Superb Jesus Jones cover of We Are So Fragile,"Some good, some 'why did they bother'. How strongly you relate to GNs music will probably influence your feelings.A bright spot is the cover of We Are So Fragile by Jesus Jones. Excellent. Visit http://www.jesusjonesarchive.com/demo.htm#rareand find out for yourself. (Then think about Never Enough, The Best of Jesus Jones instead of this album)"
2,My cat's won't touch it,None of my 3 cats will eat this even when mixed into wet food. Very disappointing because this is a high quality omega 3.
5,Giz,"This is the best book on prayer I have ever read,not to mentioned one of the best books I have ever read period. Dr Munroe gives you 13 years of research on prayer that would take the average person a life time to collect and put together the way he has. This book is very simple yet life changing. Highly recommended for any age (im 19 loved it!) You will not regret getting this book. I was very thankful to Dr Munroe after reading this book and I will probably buy about 20 more to give to my friends."
4,A Nostalgic Read on Ian Fleming's James Bond Novels,"007 JAMES BOND: A REPORT by O.F. Snelliing was one of the first books written as a commentary on the Ian Fleming novels. It is not as insightful or entertaining as Kingsley Amis' THE JAMES BOND DOSSIER, but still worth having in your Bond library. It is a nostalgic read all things being considered."
2,"Good Sound, Bad Quality","Each speaker sounds great (for the price), but one of the two has something rattling around inside. Normally, I would just open up the enclosure, but that seems to be impossible to do as the speaker grill is glued on and won't pry off. Because of this, 2/5. Bad quality control."
4,Great alternative to Bose Cubes,"I use these for rear channels in my 7.1 sound system. They work great for a budget system. Can't beat the price. Get some Bose badges and really throw people off. Well constructed, I purchased 4 and everything was perfect. Very good hi and mid frequency range."
5,Nice Add-On for a 5.1 or 7.1 System,"Got these to add onto a 7.1 system.They are a really nice sounding set and are small, so they are easy to place as the High-Front set.Sound quality is good too.First set I received was bad...one speaker was all ""Buzzy"", but Amazon replaced it quickly."
1,Do Not Buy,I spent nearly two hours before giving up trying to copy this CD onto my computer so could use with my iPod. Forget it. Evidentially Columbia must be owned by Sony and they want you to buy a Sony portable device to play this CD.
3,Excellent start - but disappointing in the end,"I was completely immersed in this book in the beginning. After Saylah moved in with the Ivy family, there were several stories that added some mystery to the story. Unfortunately the questions that added interest were never answered leaving me disappointed and unsatisfied. For example, I could not understand why Jamie couldn't move on and appreciate his present wife without understanding why/how his previous wife left. Trying to figure that out is one of the things that kept me reading to the end - only to be disappointed that the question was never answered. The book was long and seemed to repeat itself. That would have been ok, if I felt satisified in the end. Instead I felt confused and sorry that I spent so much of my time on a story that should have been better constructed. Half way throught the book, I would have given it a 5. In the end it was only a 3."
4,Great reading.,"Except for some too-graphic love scenes, it was terrific. I really want an answer to the question, ""Where is the promised sequel?""."
2,I purchased the Kindle edition,"I was disappointed in the Kindle version of this book. Although the author seemed to touch upon some very spiritual and insightful points regarding relationships and the hearts of women, there were sentences that seemed void of literary flow. At times, it was almost as if there were missing words or thoughts. Then, in Chapter 5 it became obvious that there were complete missing sentences and/or words. There were spots where the sentence stopped short and a section title seemed to appear in all capitals - completely out of context or flow of thought. It became too difficult to read.I am not sure if there was a problem when changing the book to kindle format, but there indeed is a problem with this version. I had to stop reading it."
2,Disappointing,"51 weeks into the life of this vacuum I heard an alternating sucking and blowing sound and the machine lost power. It worked pretty well til then except that it falls down easily when using the tools. And the general feel of it is cheesy, waiting for something to break. Is it worth it to spend 3 times as much for a Sebo and a 5yr warranty? I am thinking it over as I wait for the repair shop to give me the price and tell me what is wrong."
5,A Great Baking Overview Book,"I am new to cooking, and recently found this book among my mother's cookbooks. So far, the recipes have been fantastic. I've made the chocolate souffle, which was absolutely amazing, and the challah loaf, which I made a few days ago, and again today. It hasn't been out of the oven for 2 minutes before my family has begun to cut slices off! I'm excited to try more recipes out of this book, but it's worth buying just for those 2 recipes!!"
1,Don't buy this book!,this book is the most boring text i've ever seen. readers would be discouraged by the ways these authors organize the subjects.explanations of theories and ideas are overflowed..kept me and my colleagues confusing.there are always some better books better than this one.
1,Very poor product,I have a friend with this system. It is broken (produces no sound).I have heard similar Bose systems (I think the AM 5) and it produced a very thin sound where male voices sounded muffled. I believe that the tiny tiny speakers cannot produce enough bass to accurately reproduce voices (much less explosions etc).
1,"tish Tish Booom Boom WTF? is that sound,","All I have to say is areyou kidding me 1k for this POS. get the streem speaker package instead from epinions or streem speakers hemelves and you'll be happy that $200.00 system PWNS the bose through out everything you can imagine.he highs are too tizzy and, the midrange is missing and the bass is hollow and boomy, if you want 5.l from bose get three pairs of 301's and a velodyne brand sub.Satelites. 13khz-200 Khz Bass module: 280hz-46Hz.Streem system: Towers: 15 hz to 50KHZ Sub: 150Hz: 20Hz.

3,"I'm not a book critic, just a college student....","I'm not a book critic, just a college student and had to read some stories from this book for class. As I said, I haven't ready everything in the world, and don't want to be seen ignorant. But I really didn't enjoy a lot of things here, thought I haven't read all the stories. Some where enjoyable ""6"" on a 1-10 scale, 10 being the best. Some stories seem very gloomy, and all the stories that I read are loosely related to New York. But ""Good For You"" to the people who enjoyed this book. And don't just take my word for it."
3,This was a good book.,Rachel appeared to be smart in everything except her relationships with men. The storyline in this book was slow and the book could have been more descriptive.
3,Where are the other episodes?,I love this cartoon!!I would give a higher rating than 3 stars if they would come out with the rest of the series on dvd.You can get the entire run of season 1 on vhs!!Why not on dvd!!Pick up the pace Sony!!
3,Could Have Been Better,"This DVD release of the cartoon series could have been better. It's lacking the first few seconds of each of the three episodes on it. There's still enough that you can piece it together but it comes of as a little disjointed. The included episodes are 4-6 entitled 'Enter the Viper,' 'Project A, for Astral,' and 'Shell Game.'"
5,My furniture thanks me,"These are a great alternative to declawing your cat. Our cat hates these, but we love them :)One by one they eventually will fall off, so we just grab another and glue it on. The glue bottles given tend to dry up in between uses, so we just purchase some superglue, and away we go."
2,Not an Alternative to Declawing,"This product is great in theory. The plusses are, the cat didn't notice them, they looked great on him, and while they lasted, they worked okay. The negatives are, the claws didn't last long (maybe a week for half, two weeks for the other half) and that doesn't fly with me for the cost of the item. I don't believe this is a viable alternative to declawing my cat."
1,I will never buy these again!,"I was initially intrigued by these. I trim my cat's claws, but I forget sometimes, so I liked this idea. Also, it gives me a visual reminder when claws need attention, since they are colored. They are expensive, $15, but I splurged on them anyway. I'm not quite sure why other reviewers are complaining about them not sticking, the adhesive acts like superglue! I had a hard time getting the glue in the cap, but I did get it on my pants (my pants are ruined), hands (I had to unstick a couple fingers) and near (almost in) my eye. After that, they went in the trash. And, yes, as someone stated before this is a two person operation, but even then we had no luck. Best wishes to you, if you decide to try them anyway..."
4,"Decent product, just run to the hardware store for sinks","I had a hard time making sure the sink hookup didn't spray water everywhere. Wow, who's idea was it to use a cheap plastic part to hook the line to a sink? I think the part cost $4 at Home Depot. After I had it all hooked up and running water, the unit works great. Just had to get some buckets for the water to go in after that."
1,Stay away from the low-end coralife products,For the same money you can get a better unit with a TDS meter in it. My unit will not let the membrane seat properly so I can't get the water qualitity that I am suppose to. The hose connections are cheap and the plastic seat connector is quickly wearing out. I see ribbons of plastic come off everytime I disconnect it from the sink.
3,Great Value and the Backing is thin,This is a great deal for the number of sheets. The board that backs the paper is a little thin which can be a problem when you write on the pad and when its off the easel.
2,very weak backing,I should have paid attention to some of the other reviews. The backing is VERY weak so you cannot simply stand it on an easel. You need to have something that attaches it to the easel or it falls over. Paper quality is fine but the backing is useless. I would not purchase it again.
1,vidrio roto,"les escribo para informarles que el espejo que solicite llego roto, por lo cual quiero hacer un reclamo formal para que me hagan la devolucion del producto."
2,I won't be buying any more digipower products.,"This is my second set of Digipower rechargeable batteries. I bought a set of them 5-6 years ago and they weren't bad, but these don't seem to hold a charge for very long. I've also been through 3 Digipower charges in the past 5-6 years and they have all either completely or partially died. I won't be buying any more Digipower batteries or chargers and will either go back to conventional batteries or try to find better-quality rechargeables."
5,Outstanding!,"After you finish this book, you will wish you had read it a couple years earlier so you could have had a chance to meet this great American. I have known for a long time that Sheldon was a great author but had no idea that he had lived the ultimate American Dream before he started writing so late in life. The book inspired me to read his fiction and he is now one of my favorite authors. In his fiction, you will see many of the characters from his life. This is a great rags to riches story!"
2,"Memoir, Shemoir","For an author who wrote such exceptional novels, I found this to be quite boring. He spent WAY too much (2/3 of the book)on plays, screen plays, directing & producing. Not enough time on the writing of books, since that's what really made him famous( and rich). I would have liked to know more about the back story of his novels; where he got his ideas from, characters & places."
3,A journey by flute,"Suzanne Teng plays nine different kinds of flutes on this album, so if you like flutes, this album is perfect. By playing different kinds of flutes and changing musical styles throughout the album, it's kind of like a journey around the world by flute. ""Babylonians"" has a strong Middle Eastern flavor, ""Sitara"" follows with the sounds of India, then ""Motherland"" begins with a Chinese sound, but as African-sounding drums become more prominent later in the song, it becomes a fusion of world sounds.These three tracks are my favorite ones on the album. The rest of the album is good too, with a slow tempo and sounds that produce a peaceful and relaxing mood.The music is consistently high quality throughout. With a variety of sounds all mixed together, from Native American to Asian to African, blended perfectly to create a fresh mixture of sounds, this album is both relaxing and interesting."
1,Disappointing.,"Heard something from this artist (another CD) on my Pandora New Age Music station, loved it, so ordered both of her CDs. This is the only one that came, and it was not what I expected, very disappointed -- nothing on here I care to hear again. Makes me wonder if I want to try getting the other CD another time."
4,Good Starting Point for Channel Work,"If you're just learning about channels, and want to learn ways to make your images look better, this book is a good start. Scott Kelby is certainly one of the most prolific pundits in the PS world, and here he assembles techniques from many sources. Explanations are simple, the techniques are tried-and-true, and the writing is not bad (albeit a bit corny). You'll get a lot better at Photoshop by incorporating these techniques into your workflow. It is indeed NOT meant for Elements users, and assumes use of CS2, although most methods can be used in earlier versions with minor modifications.If you're looking for a treatise on the theory behind channels and color spaces, look elswhere (like Dan Margulis' work). But if you want to avoid the lofty explanations and just get in there and make your images great, this is the place for you."
3,Good but no cigar,"Kelby's instruction is excellent. The utilization of channels transforms PS CS2 into an extremely easy, more accurate way of making selections. The only flaw is that you dl the photos used in the book from Kelby's site and they all contain a massive iStock banner over the images themselves. This makes it difficult in some cases, to obtain the desired result and in all cases is most disturbing. Too bad that an excellent book is ruined by such an easily correctible fault. Kelby should have eschewed the commercial advantage in order to make the book superb."
5,Great explanation of channels in Photoshop,"I bought this book because I was confused about channels. Mr. Kelby does a good job explaining, and showing by example, how to work with channels in Photoshop. I read the reviews before I bought this book and noticed the criticism about Kelby's ""cute"" writing style and lack of detail. I bought the book anyway because I wanted the information. This is a good to great book if you want to know about channels. If you already know a lot about channels you'll probably be disappointed."
5,Great book,"In response the previous reviewer who hated it, yes I'm a beginner and thanks to Mr. Kelby I'm finally getting it. Who says that Photoshop's advanced techniques should be for the Selected few.The guy knows how to teach. Makes complicated concepts seem easy. The book is very organized and easy to read.On the downside: He is using a lot of filler addressing some topics that few of us will need."
2,High maintenance vacuum,"This vacuum has only worked flawlessly for about a week, when we first got it. Since then, it's constantly overheating from constant blockage, and the self-propel works sporadically. We don't have an especially dirty house, yet it jams up constantly. The smell of burning rubber 5 minutes after turning it on really permeates the air. That's also assuming it runs for 5 minutes without overheating and shutting off.Definitely not worth the $189 we paid for it. We're having to replace belts and filters constantly. Not recommended."
1,WARNING: You only get one suet cake - not 12!,"When I ordered this, I thought I was getting 12 suet cakes (because the description said so). But you only get ONE. And $7 and change is a bit steep for one suet cake that costs .69 elsewhere. BUYER BEWARE"
3,Birds love it but it's messy.,"The birds went crazy for this stuff. The seeds are held together with some kind of lard, which ends up all over the place. I had mine on a patio and I ended up with a greasy sludge under and around it that doesn't wash away with the rain. It took literally months to go away after I discontinued use."
1,"Good sound, if it works.","Got the radio sounds good! After 3 days or so Radio kept freezing, locked up. I would have to unplug the unit to reset. When the radio froze the remote or the knobs on the radio had no function. Then the LCD screen went blank. Returned the radio to J&R.; Had to buy another unit to get the original shipping box to return first radio. Still waiting for my credit. Second radio came. Radio will freeze after playing for 6 hours. Unit gets pretty warm. Is it overheating? It's just a radio! I think I am too embarrassed to return this one.Buyer beware. I can live with this as long as it doesn't get worse."
4,A highly detailed look at Honda Motorcycle history,"Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. Never the less, I still bought it, and was glad I did."
4,Covers all the bases...to 1989 that is,"Relatively complete coverage of Honda motorcycles to 1989. Anyone with a passing interest in motorcycles and/or Honda should find the diversity of these machines quite interesting. Unlike many motorcycle books, this is an ACTUAL book, with more words than pictures! Provides worldwide perspective without shortchanging U.S. models (as many ""motorbooks"" are produced and/or written in the U.K.).However, the book is overpriced at list. Also, it really should have at least an extra chapter added to cover the last ten years of very important motorcycle evolution (and resurgence in popularity). But to 1989 it is a great resource."
3,Disappointing,I thought the price was too high for the barely average quality and small size of this item.
5,"Flip, pat, or lift... with a nice feel","Try it... you will like it. The ""fit and finish"" is kool... the sharp but soft front edge is a non-scratch solution with a versatile set of applications and a great feel. Not meant for scraping aluminum pans... but that is not the purpose of this tool, anyhow. With normal at-home care it should last a lifetime. th"
4,"Another good OXO product, but slightly strange",Straightforward and comfortable to use. The only thing strange is a funny sort of vibration seemingly caused by the metal backbone inside the silicone turner. It doesn't affect the performance but does feel a little weird when you're using it.
5,I Like TYR,"TYR, I've brought a lot of different glasses but this my lovely and last few years I use just them."
4,Excellent Compact accessory,"For anyone who prizes compactness, these spring loaded roll-up cables are ""just the ticket"". Through a series of ratcheted stops you can extend the cable through several lengths - up to 3 feet and then, when finished, the spring mechanism will retract it back to its compact form. I have about 10 of these (since in addition to use with my laptop, I also use them around the house; where, by extending it to the exact length I need, saves me the headache of having to wrap and tie those loose unsightly cables that we constantly have to put up with between peripherals).The only concern with constant extension and retraction (when used with a portable system) is the possibility that the wire, being exercised will eventually break. With all of these cables I have had over a 10 year period, I have had only one fail - so they are pretty resilient.Note: in addition to firewire, these cables can also be purchased with other connectors e.g. Internet, USB, Modem"
4,Good review of the science of meteoritics.,"The science of meteoritics encompasses meteors, meteorites, and the features made by meteorites when they strike the Earth. All three are well covered in this pocket-sized guide. The basic forms of metoerites, irons and stones, are excellently discussed, as are impact craters. The book contains a particularly good review of the huge meteorite crater known as the Ries Kessel, (Giant Kettle), a 15-mile wide scar in SouthernGermany. I would have liked color photography, but the photos are well-chosen, if sparse. The text rolls right along and is rated as high school graduate level. Author Heide has written a fine introduction to the subject of meteoritics, and I give the book a good recommendation."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"We previously had a Krups and then a Braun espresso machine. Each lasted ten...yes, 10...years. When the Braun went kaput, I purchased the Capresso. I didn't want anything fancy but something that would hold up to our daily use. The machine was very simple and perfect for a beginner. Unfortunately, it died one year and one month after purchase. Go figure...one month after the warranty was up. Things that make you go...hmmmm. I won't be buying another."
5,Great little Machine!,"As a newbie I can only speak from my very limited experience with Espresso/Cappuccino machines. For the money, this appears to be an Excellent starter model for anyone wanting to experiment with brewing their coffee house favorites in their own home! It is easy to operate and cleans up quickly. The espresso/cappuccino/lattes' are Very Nice and compareable with many of the smaller family owned coffee houses. Don't expect that Professional cup from a $2,500.00 machine... but for $60, you get a Very Nice cup of your own favorite brew right at home. Sharp looking small machine that fits easily on your counter."
5,capresso mini expresso machine,"I purchased this for my daughter who attends The CUlinary Institute of America. She claims it makes the BEST expresso, is easy to use. A GREAT VALUE"
3,"I missed the word ""mini"" when you desribed this machine","I haven't even used this very very small machine. I could kick myself in the butt for not realizing just how small this is. I don't know who long it takes to make one pot, butt I would need at least three. So, I saw the perfect machine in Linen's n Things for $169.00. Guess I'l start saving and maybe try and sell this machine, not in less your willing to take it back for a refund. I don't sell merchandise, so I could maybe give it as a chrsitmas gift to someone this year."
3,Helpful customer service,"The steamer on this machine didn't work great from the start, and eventually stopped working altogether after about 2 months. However, I do have to compliment the customer service department at Capresso. I have spoken on the phone with the folks there multiple times and always found them helpful. Although the whole process was inconvenient from my end, the machine was replaced without difficulty. (Hopefully the new one will be OK!)"
4,nice little machine,i bought this for a friend of mine...she loves it! looks good on the counter and makes a fine cuppa joe! this is for those of us who like our coffee thick and rich...not for die hard espresso connesseurs.
2,"Flimsy, knob now broken","My machine worked well for a few months. I used it twice a week or so, making usually one cup at a time (the second cup comes out too watery to drink). Then the knob just stopped being able to turn. I've tried everything short of taking the machine apart to try to make it work again.To be honest I'm quite happy to have an excuse to finally get rid of this thing and purchase something better. I will never buy this brand again."
4,"Good in the beginning, not in the end","I received this machine as a b-day present in Dec. 2005. For the first 1-2 years I worked great for lattes, that is all I used it for. About 9 months to a year ago the espresso started to get bitter, and taste burnt. I have cleaned it multiple times and it doesn't do any good. When I make it I might get 1 shot of ""good"" espresso but it starts to get a burned taste after that. This is a good espresso machine for a starter, but don't expect it to last for too long. I am in the process of buying a higher end espresso machine right now."
2,Don't waste your money,"I can't get good tasting espresso out of this thing. From what I understand now, it is because this does not have a pump, and somehow that makes it easier to burn the espresso."
3,dvd quality is not very good but contents is good.,At the same time I would prefer have more tipical russian dishes covered like foods from ground meat.
4,Enjoyable Read...Not just for Fans,"This book really surprised me. Martin Kemp (actor and ex-Spandau Ballet bassist), tells his story of life in the fast lane with a successful pop group, his life as an actor,the numerous dodgy acting roles that he took to establish himself to the life-threatening double brain tumour...He tells his story candidly and engages the reader. It you are looking for a warts and all account, you will not get it here. There is no dirt-dishing and no-one will be offended. My impression is that nothing would make it's way onto these pages that would upset his family. He is too 'nice' for that. There are references to drug-taking and excessive drinking but nothing to frighten anyone. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and Martin proved to be fantastic company."
3,This disc has some real good songs but isn't the fall's best,"If youre a Pavement fan, you've probably heard plenty about the Fall and their influence. I have to admit that the singer Mark E. Smith sounds basically like SM with a British accent, but otherwise not much of the music resembles much of what Pavement has done, with the exception of a few weirder Westing-like tracks. However, the first track ROCKS, and there are a few other real good songs that sound better than the rest of what post-punk Britain was producing at the time. The Fall have plenty of other better records, but this one's good to have, sort of like how nobody REALLY likes Bad Moon Rising but everybody has it."
1,Clubman Pinaud Lilac Vegetal,"I must agree with those that write that this product smells like urinal cakes. Immediately after removing the cap from the bottle, the aroma of a men's bathroom filled my nose. For those who like the scent, remember this, you may appreciate the scent, but the chances are quite good that someone in your company will think that you smell like the urinal at their favorite bar. Why take that chance when there are other products?"
2,Not for me,Lot's of people love this; but to me it smelled like old people at a funeral parlor. I re-gifted it.
5,"Extremely masculine scent, although not as strong as before","This is an extremely masculine scent, although it isn't as strong as it used to be. It's an extremely clean scent I remember my father and grandfather wearing."
1,"Smells really bad, actually.","I wanted to like this stuff, but it doesn't smell good at all, not even in small quantities. I was drawn to it because it claims a subtle lilac smell, which is fairly unique in men's grooming and hygiene products. I love lilac. This smells less like lilac and exactly like the wipes my wife uses to clean out our hedgehog's cage, Nature's Miracle Deodorizing Cage Wipes (http://www.amazon.com/NMIR-ANI-CAGE-WIPES-35COUNT/dp/B0010OQGH6/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1333322065&sr;=1-1-catcorr).It's also very runny, just completely watery, no thickness to it at all. That's fine, I suppose, but when I hear the word ""vegetal"" I think of something more substantial than this. It's probably better than most of the goop on the shelves today, but it stinks. I recommend this instead: Nivea For Men Revitalizing Balm (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FPZAFC/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details); sometimes modern products really are improvements over the old timey ones."
2,Not a keeper,"Works as it should as an aftershave, but I don't care for the scent. It is not offensive, just not my 'style'. It has an aroma reminiscent of Johnson's baby powder, very mild, and, as I said, not offensive. I will stick with the original scent from now on."
4,Nice detail,"Nice product. I used melting wafers in different colors to create train candies for cupcake toppers for my son's birthday party. The candies pulled out nice and easy with a simple tap and look great with nice details.The ONLY reason I gave it 4 star instead of 5 was because of the little tiny train car that you see 2 times in the center row. It just looked odd being so much smaller than the other pieces, I didn't use any of those pieces at all."
5,Fanstastic little stove!!,"We purchased to help keep the heating bill down. Not only is it working very efficiently, but it looks great. We have a large living/dining area that it heats great. If i had more money, i would get one for the bedroom as well! We get a lot of comments on this stove, most of our friends now want one. I definitely recommend this for a small electric stove."
1,happy,we are very happy with our new heater. I really like the flame affect it doesn't look cheap. It is sturdy and heats the place nicely.
5,Really cute and should work well in our RV...once it gets cold...,"We currently have this sitting in our TV room, we have a very small 2/2 house...have only used it for the effects not the heat...yet, we are in S. FL...so when it gets cold we will let everyone know how it works...but we did test it, and it does put out some heat...we think it will work well in our small Rv...thanks"
3,"Cute, but...","We were so excited about getting this after reading the reviews. It's really nice looking, and it does throw heat. However, we used this 6-7 evenings in one month just to help heat a small living room and our electric bill went up nearly $100. I don't know if we got a lemon or what, but seeing reviews on how efficient it was, that bill was shocking. We only use the flame now for ambiance. Too bad, because we want to love it, but we're afraid to use it because of the amount of power it draws."
5,Love my electric heater,"I live in a 2 story townhome and the downstairs is about 8 degrees colder than the upstairs in the winter. With this cute little stove (love the appearance), it takes about 2 hours to heat up the downstairs...but it does heat it up. Thank goodness! Haven't seen my electric bill yet."
2,Boring!,I couldn't finish the book! The book is all about soldiers in the military in Israel and other war-related stuff! Not much about civil life!!!I bought the book with the hope to tell me something about the day to day civil life in Israel but this book is far away from that!!
5,The Three Meter Zone,Excellent book for any leader that would like to fine tune there skills and furture career advancment
5,Three Meter Zone,"This is excellent reading for all business personel. It is down to earth, grass roots, management. Basically the author teaches that without training, cross training, and effective execution, sense of duty, loyality and taking care of your employees (soldiers),the business is slated for failure. I was so impressed by this book that I bought 4 additional copies and gave them to managers 3 levels up the management chain in our company."
4,Eye-Opening Entertainment,"Diving the Seamount can be summed up in one word: phenomenal. Tom Rapko reminds us all that we should take time away from our busy lives to actually experience life and embrace that which brings us happiness. Gus, fully enmeshed in the fast-paced world of a young, promising attorney, experiences a spiritual awakening while visiting the sleepy Baja village of La Paz. Once satisfied by material possessions and career advancement, he finds himself longing for the simplicity and beauty of life in the small Mexican village. His ambition turns quickly towards realizing his new goal: leaving all of the constraints behind and enjoying life in La Paz. Life in La Paz moves on at its own pace, enveloping him and those like him who appreciate the beauty inherent in simple existence."
3,Excellent book BUT beware.,"First let me say I do recommend this book. It has some good tips at the beginning (although you'll find that same wisdom in any good magic book), and the drawings are excellent (although as someone else said at times hard to follow). However I would like to add one warning.The reason I gave this book 3 stars rather than five is that it is VERY sparce on explanation. For example, to explain the classic palm on page 92 it shows an excellent picture then says ""Difficult to do well, but it does give you the freedom to use your fingers while palming a coin. Sharply milled coins work best."" In other words he may as well have not explained anything. I HIGHLY doubt that if you've not seen the classic palm explained elsewhere that you will be able to develop good technique from one simple (albeit beautiful) sketch."
3,theres magic in the air,Well written and illustrations are comprehensible. There are many books that meet this same need so it is not unique. Was worth the purchase.
4,Getting Started,"I recieved this book for Christmas and I really like it. The book shows some good techniques for doing some very interesting sleights. The only thing I would change would be the sketches. Overall the pictures are pretty good, but the sketch style makes some pictures difficult to figure out. It is worth the time and effort."
1,I don't like Bouncy (Beyoncé),I don't like Bouncy (Beyoncé). If it wasn't for my sister asking to buy this dvd to give it to her kids for Christmas I would not have bought the dvd. She doesn't have internet access and I was given the money to buy the dvd.
1,"Unless you are an ""extreme"" Beyonce fan...",Who would enjoy her even if she sang Slim Whitman's songs? This DVD is very boring to say the least. The only good song is Beautiful Liar featuring Shakira. I wish I can get my money back.
5,Shana,"My kitty didn't really want me to hold her there and put these on her, but they do work. And they don't seem to bother her. The hardest part is trying to keep kitty still so you can get them on correctly, but I would recommend them if your cat scratches up anything. It's better than removing the nails completely. And besides, your kitty will have pretty pink, blue, purple, or rainbow colored nails! Scatching posts and/or a scathing lounge are good too. Sometimes those distract kitty from scatching other items you don't want her/him to."
3,come off,These were cool and until my cat figured out how to took them off. Now we can't keep them on her for more than a day or two.
3,Careful!,"My cat chewed hers off! If she couldn't get it off, she'd chew right through the ends of the tips so only half of the ""soft claw"" was left, obviously doing no good."
4,Saved my furniture,"They do have the habit of falling off, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than declawing....temporarily anyway. If you're trying to save up to declaw your cats, or you feel against doing that...these are for you. I get lots of comments on them!"
4,Worked - but not like we hoped...,This did help our dog's skin but it didn't really work as well as we'd hoped. We ended up needing a prescription from our vet for another product we purchased from her that helped a lot more. I'd suggest asking your vet before purchasing something like this - they may have a better alternative and it'll save you a few bucks.
5,Love It,Great spoon. I wish I had more of these they clean easy and can be used while cooking a variety of foods.
4,Good self-biography.,"I read this book, translated to portuguese, here in Brazil.It's good self-biography.Golda Meir tells about his life, since she left Russia, until his old age times.The problem in this book, is that she talks too much about his believes and Israel, and not enough about himself."
4,Thierry Mugler has wonderful scents.,"I like Thierry Mugler's line of fragrances. So, when I received a sample of Alien, I was again impressed. I have to admit that Innocent is my favorite. But, I decided to try the Alien scent and was wonderfully pleased with the fragrance. However, I did not get as many compliments on the scent as I do with Innocent. Alien is more of a low key, softer fragrance that complements your natural aura. Way to go Thierry Mugler!"
3,"Pretty Intriguing, but not this best","You find yourself pretty amazed at how easy and simple the scam is, but the overall story was just okay. It's not a total bore, but in my opinion, not his best. Actually when you get the whole effect of the scam and exactly how it works, you are almost halfway through the book. It's an easy read. Got a couple of hours to kill on the beach? Definitely the book to bring."
4,Excellent !!,"After reading some reviews, I hesitated to buy this book. I found it to be very exciting and a book I couldn't put down. I am a very big Grisham fan, and I would have given this book 5 stars, but one would have to admit that Grisham is not one for explosive endings in his books (that's why I only give 4 stars). I really liked the way be built the story, and would suggest this book to anyone, not just Grisham fans."
4,"Great, fast, entertaining book.","Not his best (A Time to Kill was) or his worst (The Street Lawyer). It was a fast, fun and exciting read. He is a great story teller that can keep you up at all hours to finish. It does sound like our current government he wrote about. Have fun!"
1,The Brethren by John Grisham,This was by far the poorest written and sorry excuse for a plot I have read in a long time. I am a long-time fan of Grisham's for his interesting story-lines which are generally well written. this was pure Trash! I feel as though he has insulted all of us for not being intelligent enough to bother to write a decent story for. He can't need the money that much to write anything this bad! My last Grisham purchase
1,Nonsense,"It is a perfect book. A perfectly inaccurate book. Can't say I'm thrilled by the writing style either, but to each his own. My first and last Grisham."
2,Depends on the Reader,The Brethren is an interesting book in some ways. A government agency tries to control a Presidential election. With a man who they believe has no skeletons from his past. At the same time 3 Judges who fell from high society on separate crimes at different times are trying to get rich using an extortion scam. It wasn't that good of a book in my opinion but it depends on the reader. This book was not a particularly good read to me.
3,"Better than Testament, but not A Time To Kill","If you have read Grisham before, you know he draws you in withgreat characters caught in improbable situations. However, with eachnew book it seems as if Grisham says ""O.K. I've done about 300 pages, let's wrap it up."" He starts you on this rollor coaster ride that stops halfway down the big hill. Read it but try not to get caught up in it......it will let you down."
1,Disappointed,"I've read every Grisham book the week it came out. His novels are usually filled with action or conviction. This one has neither. It is a boring, unethical story of greed, deception and the state of American politics. It's the only one that I won't keep in my library."
3,Brethren Revisited,"When this John Grisham book first came out--I panned it. As I was telling people about the plot, I kept hearing remarks, ""well that sounds interesting to me"". Hmmmm.....So, I re-read ""The Brethren"", pretending I did not know who the author was. And you know what? I liked it.Ok, it's not the best legal thriller. However, if one supposes that three irreverant Judges are in prison and from behind bars they scheme to blackmail affluent people vis a vis a gay boy pen pal scam by personal ads, they realize they have marked a guy that eventually is picked to BE the next President of the U.S. and you do get quite a unique plot.We get an inside look into minimum-security penitentiaries, holy rolling corrupt politics, shark infested attorney waters, and a fast fun read from John Grisham.Try it again, just cover the authors name, revisit some lively characters and at closer look--a flap jack flipping genius of a plot.I appreciate your interest & comments--CDS"
1,The Brethren,Doubt it would be published if it didn't have Grisham's name on it. Absolutely disjointed and unbelievable - Actually no begining and defintely no ending - skimmed most because it just didn't make sense. Glad i got it from my library - spending even a penny would have been a waste of money.
1,do not waste the money,"This is the first Grisham book I have had to make myself finish. No plot to speak of,no interesting main character. Dull and boring!"
3,WASN'T AS BAD AS THE REVIEWS. Audiobook.,"I enjoyed listening to most of the book.It got my attention and kept it through most of the book.One of the problems with JG books is that the ending is so anti climatic and so bland.That was no different in this book.If you don't expect must from the ending, then you can enjoy the read."
2,Disappointing,"I found this to be my least favorite of all of his work. I thought the plot was weak, and the ending too pat. After the Testament, this book was a big letdown!"
1,"Very, very disappointing.","I know that probably those of you who read these reviews are die-hard Grisham fans, as I am. I love his writing, and his style. But, this book was a major disappointment to me. First, the price is ridiculous to me. But, I bought it anyway, thinking that it would be a great read. Well, it wasn't! It was one of the worst books I have ever read. There was no suspense, no plot, and none of the usual legal techinicality which is so common with Grisham's other books. I reccomend highly against buying this book, but if you must read it, may I suggest your local public library? Then, you won't waste that wad of cash that you will have regretted spending."
3,Worth the read!,"Although The Brethren was not as engaging a read as Grisham's former works (i.e. The Pelican Brief, The Partner), I do believe this one is worth the read. As with his other books, you are guessing the entire way through about how the various characters will end up interacting. However, half-way into the book, I found it slightly difficult to keep going; it was hard to stay focused on Lake's character in particular. But the ending makes it worthwhile. As always, Grisham leaves you with a smirk on your face as you turn the last page."
1,Very disappointed.,"I have just started reading Grisham. I really enjoyed ""The Last Juror"". This book was a complete waste of time."
2,Big let down,It started out strong and slowly went downhill from there and I do meah DOWNHILL. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start something else. A TIME TO KILL is still his best.
3,not one of Grisham's best,It took me awhile to get into this one. However I did manage to get hooked into the story and enjoying it. I just don't think it is one of his best works.
2,Not his best work,"John Grisham is as addictive as any other author out there...but his newest book, The Brethren, does not live up to his usual standards. It is still typical John Grisham style, but I wish he would go back to the style he perfected in A Time to Kill."
3,Predictable Grisham,"I have read all of the Grisham books. I do enjoy his writing. With that said, I also must say that his style is becoming very predictable. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I would like to see him ""stretch"" somewhat and give us something totally different."
2,Not Up To Standards,"This might not be a bad novel, unless you're John Grisham. The author set himself a very high standard with his previous work, so it was perhaps inevitable that he would eventually fail to live up to it. This book reads more like a cheap detective story than the well crafted, intricately plotted stories we have come to expect from this author. It will be interesting to see his next novel. Will he return to his former glory or churn out another example of pulp fiction."
2,"Really, finished already?","Skeletons in the closet are what this story is all about. They're actually high-powered skeletons kept by no less than the most popular candidate for the American presidency. Skeletons that are being threatened to be exposed by conniving inmates in a federal prison. A threat that was put at bay by no less than the CIA.Everything was going nicely on all fronts: intriguing characters, exciting plot build up. I was telling myself this is why I like Grisham; then without warning, it suddenly ended! The complications presented in 99 percent of the book were resolved and concluded in the last one percent. The conclusion was not a surprise either, one could see it coming early on. So there I was, wondering where the other pages might have gone; but it was really the end already!Was it just me? Would I have reacted differently if I took less time to finish this book? I haven't seen the other reviews yet, but I don't think so."
3,What was he thinking?,"I think that John Grishman woke up one day and thought he was Tom Clancy and then set out to write The Brethren. The only problem is that he has done a poor impression. This books lacks the intense climax of previous Grishman novels. It does not draw you in and the only reason I was able to read fast was because my head was use to doing so with Grishman novels.This book is totally different then previous Grishman novels. Lawyers don't really play a key role here like the The Firm and Rainmaker. This is definitely not the book to recommend to people who haven't read Grishman before. Mr. Grishman, go back to your former successful style when you write your next book and leave Tom Clancy to write Tom Clancy books."
1,Have Not Yet Received Book,"After a month, I have yet to receive this book from seller? So I do not really have much to base a review on at this point...."
2,Really bad ending,"I liked this book up until the ending. I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book. Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me."
4,Stellar,"As anyone who reads John Grisham knows, you can count on a great story. This one kept me reading continuously until I was done. I can't wait for his next book."
1,Wake me when it's over!,"Yawn. I was full of eager anticipation when I began this book, only to become increasingly disappointed the further I read. I'm alarmed by the people saying it is ""One of Grisham's best!""I found it to be a plot with potential, drowning in lazy development of characters (who were we supposed to like and relate with?) and a *weak* ending.I'd give it 1/2 a star if that was a choice. Save your money and check it out at the library if you must read it."
3,Good story but lame ending.,"I heard that this book was going to be a big hit, so I took a chance and read it. I have to say it had a good interesting story but it had major flaws. #1.. It had a lame ending. #2.. Some characters were a pian in the %*&#@. And #3.. It might be disapionting to John Grisham fans."
1,Weak.,"Grisham has hit is all time low with this book. There is not one character in this novel with whom you can relate. I understand Grisham may have been trying to go a different direction, but he failed miserably."
2,"A fair quality book, but certainly not a classic","I saw this book in the store and I bought it because of John Grisham's reputation as a great writer of thrillers, particularly the courtroom variety. This book was a quick and easy read, and it wasn't bad, but I thought that it never really ""took off"" and got very exciting. It has an interesting premise (three disgruntled jailbird judges blackmail older closeted-gay men by posing as younger openly gay jail prisoners via letters) but it seemed gimmicky and not really all that well done in my opinion. It seems like something where the reader might simultaneously wish the novel were longer because he or she wants the plot/subplots developed more thoroughly, but also wish the story were shorter because it's just not really an exciting story."
4,"Good, but not one of his best","Have you ever wondered how 3 former judges serving their time in a federal prison could endanger the future of a man running for President? John Grishan can, for sure...Aaron Lake seems to be the ""perfect"" man for the Oval Office. A nice family man, church goer, and with no black marks on his CIA file. He is ""politically correct"" and suitable for the position. Can it be too perfect?It seems not... and those 3 crooked guys are about to find out why..."
2,Poor Plot With Nowhere To Go,"...Here, in The Brethren, the CIA Director decides to handpick the next president. He has no problem with this little mission, but when the candidate turns out to be a closet homosexual ensnared in a blackmail scheme cooked up by three judges doing time in a federal pen, the Director and his minions have serious problems in figuring out how to defuse it.That -- along with a drunk ...lawyer... is the sum and substance of this ridiculous tripe. And, because of this ""plot,"" the book has nowhere to go and simply peters with an extremely ludicrous ending. ..."
3,Original,"I've read all of Grisham's novels, and this one was interesting but not really gripping..Well written as always, but certainly not his best effort."
1,WHAT IS IT ABOUT GRISHAM?,"I swore I would never read another Grisham book. I'm sure Grisham doesn't care--he has plenty of fans and doesn't need me! But so many CAN'T be wrong and me right! So--I tried this book and gave Grisham another chance. In my opinion, he failed miserably! The beginning of the book is so boring I almost gave up during the first chapter. I'll give Grisham this, he does do a good job of weaving the two plot strands together and he is good at plotting. His plots, however, all turn out to be formulaic and anti-climactic. I think men would like Grisham's books a lot more than women--he has yet to create a good and believable female character. Understandable. Well, I hated the book, but I can't say Grisham is bad. He does, after all, enthrall millions of readers so he has to be doing something right. If you're a Grisham fan, buy this book. If not, skip it. It's not even Grisham's best!"
3,I Question the Ending,"I am usually a big fan of John Grisham books. I truly enjoyed ready the Brethren. I carried the book with me to read while waiting on my kids to finish lessons, etc. I could not wait for Grisham's exiting ending. Where was it? When I finished the book, I felt like he wrote the ending for a screenplay. I could see where it could be made very dramatic on screen, it just did not work in text. Leave those endings up to Producers! Grisham needs to remember we were READING not watching!"
2,"John, How Could You?","Where was the hero? Who should I have been rooting for? What happened to the escapee? Was the world really in that much danger, or did Maynard have another agenda? Why would Lake do that? Why would two legitimate judges tolerate and work with a local yokel justice of the peace? Those are just a few of my questions, and none of them were answered. Compared to where started, with The Firm and A Time to Kill, we have lost touch and I don't really know what John is thinking anymore. Maybe the well has run dry."
1,The Brethren,"As a Grisham fan for years, this book is a major disappointment. I would have chucked it after first few chapters had I not been loyal to author. No character development, no plot twists, this book meanders without direction. I was truly hoping for a surprise ending, but was left totally unsatisfied. John, please give us something good, like Rainmaker II?"
1,Very Disapointed by this book,"If there was ""No Star"" listed, I would have chosen that option. I thought ""The Testement"" was bad, this is worse. There was no character development, no suspense, no twists and turns in the plot like his earlier books. I had no passion for nor could I have cared less about any character in the book. I even got the feeeling reading this book that someone else wrote it and stuck his name on it. It just didn't seem like a Grisham novel. Save your money."
2,It is an okay book,"The book was an easy read. But unlike his other books where there was at least one or two characters that you relate too in someone way. In this book, there is no such relationship built, between characters in the book or someone reading the book, just could not not relate. But I am still a Grisham fan with A Time to Kill, The Client are my favorite."
3,"Not Grisham's Best, but I Could Not Put it Down!",Although the bretheren are three flawed protagonists they are like naughty children; you can not turn your back on them. They demand that you keep turning pages to find out their next move.
2,Barely passable,"It seems inescapable that Grisham's ""The Firm"" was his best story. After that, each book has gotten successively worse, roughly linearly, except for this one. ""The Street Lawyer"" was terrible; ""The Brethren"" just barely passes muster. It's not that it is unrealistic -- I work in a court and can suspend disbelief for most legal books (which, unfortunately, is invariably necessary) -- but that it is plain & simple a bad read. No real plot to speak of. No characters to which to become attached. No empathy with the story at all, in fact. Stale ideas, stale prose, awkwardly plotted and badly told. Skip this one unless you have absolutely nothing better to do; go back and read a much earlier Grisham or try Brad Meltzer's ""The Tenth Justice"". Or go for a brisk walk; anything."
3,One for the road...,"As with the approach of summer, I seem to wait anxiously for a new Grishom novel to be my business traveling companion. So to this year as the Bretheren landed in my mailbox. For the road, this Grishom is better than the last two and is filled with characters who, given the nature of their persona, make many an airplane hour pass by. I found this book worthy of another read some flight down the road."
3,Killer Anti-Climax,"Grisham has unparalleled ability to create suspense and intrigue in his books. I read the The Brethren in 2 hours only to be incredibly diappointed in the end. I am still confused as to why he ended the book this way. The book was over 50 pages prior to the last page. I wish he would rewrite the last 7 chapters, I was very disappointed."
1,Another weak ending,"Last and certainly least! This is the weakest of all Grishams books. It took me about 80 pages before I was not forcing myself to continue reading. I usually grab the main character and root for him/her in Grisham's work. Not this time. They were all boring and none were clever. No character development and the plot was poor. Grisham never ends a book well. It is almost like he gets tired and wraps it up to get rid of the project but the ending did not detract from this. It was bad from beginning to end. I am only glad that I read it, so I can say I read it, when everyone that reads Grisham talks about it. Its an easy read. Try it. You may like it and think I am crazy."
2,predictable and flakey,"I have read all of Grisham's books and this one is definately one of the worst ones. It was inadequatly developed and just plain trash. I'd usually put Grisham above Michael Crichton, but not this time. It was a fast read, but not stimulating in the least. If you're just looking to waste a few hours, pick up this book. If you're looking for something more stimulating, look elsewhere."
2,Not his best......but a good read anyway!,"Comparing this to Grisham's earlier work, The Brethren fails to stack up. Written a bit too simple, and lacking the punch & suspense I've come to appreciate from him, this is not his best work. But, I will continue to buy any new Grisham novel and give him the benefit of the doubt."
3,An easy read,"Grisham has become a staple of my reading not because he writes great novels, but because he writes readable books that aren't very challenging to ones points of view and he writes them frequently which allows me periodic breaks from more serious reading. This book is the perfect example. An easily told tale that is fast paced and not at all thought provoking. I'm glad he broke his formula after Street Lawyer and the last two books have been definite improvements.While not nearly the book A Time to Kill is, its clearly better than his anti-death penalty crusade of The Chamber. Of the highs and low of Grisham's works, this one fits in the middle, thus three stars.He'll probably sulk all the way to the bank with his studio check. This like almost all his recent books read more like a screen play than a novel. I wish he would show the talent that wrote A Time to Kill Again."
4,Grisham delivers again,"The Brethern is certainly different from Grisham's earlier works. There is a role for a lawyer in the story, but only a minimum one. The strength of the book, besides Grisham's fine writing, is in the plot (or plots), building around various conspiracies or scams concocted by the characters in the story, including a top US government official. I found the book a little slow to begin with, and I guess that's because there are so many characters involved in the story. Half way through, I still did not know who the real heroes are. But, typical of Grisham, he keeps us in suspense all the way and the outcome is full of surprises. Yes, Grisham has delivered the goods once again. His fans would not be disappointed with this one."
1,I Can't Recommend This One,"I've read and enjoyed most of John Grisham's novels, but this one bored me to tears. The premise was a good one, but the plotting and the writing dulled all hope of an interesting story. The fact that there was not one single likable character just added to the depressing trend of the tale. Like a few other reviewers here, I struggled through 400 plus pages hoping for a satisfying conclusion. It didn't happen. I just can't find anything good in this book to recommend it to other readers."
3,The end?,"I began reading this book with much anticipation. It is Grisham, so it has to be pretty good, right? Well, that's just what it is ""pretty good"", not ""great"". The storyline is good with a nice political scandal twist, but it seemed like I just kept waiting for the really intense part and it never came. I didn't have much trouble putting it down when need be. Don't get me wrong, this was still an entertaining book, it's just not a book you would stay up all night to read."
4,Not that bad...,"I have read every Grisham book so far, and I have to say The Brethen is the most daring one. The style is totally different and John Grisham took a big risk writting this book. But, I liked it. He was able to talk about politics and law, about 4 major characters, all in one book. It may not be the best Grisham book yet, but it is not the worst either. This one is better than The Testament, and it is a great book to read if english is not your first language. If you're a Grisham fan, you should buy this book, even if it's only to see if he succeeded in this new writting style."
2,Wait for it at the library,Easily his worst book. Worst than Rainmaker. Very boring and unbelievable story with no surprises at all. Save your money and borrow from the library.
3,"""Brethrens'"" good for a boring weekend","The Brethren has the usual Grisham plot twisters interlaced the laws--a seedy deal, loopholes, ect. However, in this novel Grisham add another layer to it--politics. However his efforts fall short of expectations. The Bretherns' seedy schemes are amusing and Grisham's satire of the polical system is, at best, trite. With dialogues like, ""With all the new artilerities being made, why would the Iraqis want to buy used ones. We assume it's fully operational."" The character is supposedly the head of the CIA, one would expect the man to be more knowledgable. My advice to the author, ""Stick to what you know best and leave the political satire to better able writers.""Don't get me wrong, the book kills several hours out of your day and is entertaining to read if you have nothing else better to do. The plot is intriguing and, I hate to admit, captivating. Once you've sank your teeth into there's no putting the book down. You have to find out how it ends, trite as it is."
2,No too good...not that bad...,"Grisham knows how to tell a story. The setup here was very very cool, but the story just sort of... ended.... Whacking the drunk lawyer surprised me - seemed really out of place... I will continue to buy Mr. Grisham's books and will just figure he didn't have his heart into this one."
2,A disappointing read,"While THE BRETHREN has Grisham's characteristic pace and styling, two major flaws made it a disappointing read. First, there were no likeable characters - no one to cheer for or fear for. Second, the plot lacked suspense - likely because I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. Grisham seems to have written this one while in a cynical funk."
3,"Plot twists, fascinating characters....",the story line and characters are excellent! Places seemed familiar...and the governmental angles were fascinating (really makes you think about how do things really work?) I was enthralled in wanting to see where the various plot lines went and truly enjoyed reading the book (the first Grisham I have read)....until the end. The ending was disappointing - I felt he could have done more or better given all the intricacies throughout the book.
5,I LIKE THIS BOOK!,"I have discovered John Grisham recently and ""The Brethren"" is the first book of his that I've read. I LOVED IT!!! This book rocks!!!! Yay John Grisham."
2,Thunderous Thud,"This page-turner moved along at a fast pace and appeared to be a real winner. At the end, it appeared that Grisham had nowhere to go, so it simply ended in silly bland foolishness. If he only worked a little harder on the last 10 or 15 pages, he could have had a real winner."
1,Poor John ran out of good Southern Lawyer stories...,"Have read most Grisham books to date. Most have been predictable but enjoyable. Would liken his style to a grown-up Hardy Boys book. Clean with simple plots, easy to read. This latest output seems like it was forced out, to meet a deadline or condo payment. (Maybe it wasn't his own story?) At any rate, save your money and buy Angela's Ashes."
3,Left me wanting for more.....,"Grisham's plots are usually more riveting. I still couldn't put the book down but the outcome was predictable. Some of the plot turns were not believable and the ending was too soft. I didn't get the usual ""eye opening and jaw dropping"" surprise at the end."
2,Disappointed,"I guess this is John Grisham is due a bad book once in a while, I heard some people I spoke with his ""laundry list"" proving some people will buy anything certain authors write. Since the ""Pelican Brief"" Grisham has gone down hill some but this book is just plain bad. The story seems to go nowhere fast and seems to limp along at the end."
2,Below Average,"I sure expected more from this book. Grisham does a fantastic job all the way through half the book. After that, the story is predictable, some secondary characters are never mentioned again (not that they were missed) and the conclusion is anti-climatic. Not best Grisham material."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am an avid John Grisham fan and have enjoyed all of his past works. This book, however, was very disappointing. The characters were not developed, there were too many side storylines, and the plot was implausable. I kept reading waiting for the book to pick up and hoping for a great ending, but the book just ended, period. With an infant daughter I have limited reading time, and I am sorry I wasted it on this book."
2,What a disappointment . . .,"I eagerly looked forward to reading this next installment of Grisham's. What a disappointment. This book was lightweight compared to his previous blockbusters. There were too many characters intertwined who had no real purpose in the story. The underlying sub-plot of the ""brethren"" was also a turnoff. I miss the courtroom drama of his previous books and the intensity that always lies within. This book is not a true representation of Grisham's talent. Novels like ""A Time to Kill"" and ""The Testament"" and ""The Partner"" more accurately depict the true genius Grisham is. This particular book shows that he, too, can write a bad novel."
2,"Gaps, Gaps and more Gaps",I have to say that this is the worst of all the Grisham novels. There are more holes in this story than swiss cheese. Grisham is getting like CSI. He is writing down to the people that can't follow a normal story. This book assumes so much and leaves a million questions open.
1,Grisham riding on past successes,"An extremely disappointing book. The author seems to have run out of decent ideas and is now trading on the reputation he established with his earlier novels. It appears that he had no idea where the story would end when he started writing, and that's exactly what happens. Right up to the last page, I kept hoping that something creative would emerge. No such luck. I guess one might say that the book has a plot, but it has one of the flatest endings of any novel that I can recall. Each of his last several books has been a bigger disappointment than the one before. The good news is that this is the last review I will probably write relating to his works, since I don't intend to waste my time reading any more."
4,"Not Grisham's Greatest, But Not His Worst By A Long Shot","With The Brethren, John Grisham has written yet another engaging, thrilling novel. The plot centers around three judges who were disbarred due to their criminal activities. While serving time at a federal prison, they form the brethren, a group that controls the prison system with an iron fist. They come up with a scheme in which they will prey upon people with secrets to hide. From the first page, Grisham draws us in with his trademark twists and turns. As usual, this was a quick read. This is definitely a book that everyone can enjoy."
2,WHERE'S THE MISSING CHAPTER?,"I had to turn the page at the end hoping for another chapter. When I realized there wasn't another one, I put the book down disappointed. It was almost like Mr. Grisham was late for a golf game and was going to mail the manuscript on his way to tee off! I was so excited to read this book and it did only take a weekend to read. There was one ""aha"" point where I knew the two scenerios would somehow collide and that was what got me through the book. Wait for the paperback or you can have my copy! Ü"
1,Save it for the beach,Not his best outing. Lame blend of his previous books. Save this book for reading after you finish 18 holes in the morning and don't feel like doing anything taxing.
1,Grossly disappointed!,"I agree with every negative comment your customers made. I have read every one of Grisham's books, and I can't believe John wrote this one. It took me a whole month to read this book. I had to make myself finish it. I went to sleep every time I tried to read it. I hope he reads all our comments and does a better job on his next book."
2,Well...,"I have read almost all of John Grisham's books and it seems to me that they keep getting worse. I loved The Firm, A Time to Kill, and the Partner. After the Street Lawyer his book are just boring, the Testiment was a little better. The Brethren was about the worst of his books that I have read. It took me so long to get through. I was not reading the book to find out what happens but to just finish it so I could start a different one."
2,No Mystery-Just Another Enemy of the State,"I cannot beleive I paid good money for this book It was so predicatable from beginning to end-I was disappointed(although Testamont was even more disapponting)I maay have to stop reading John Grisham Books-Mary Higgins Clark is so much better I mean Big Brother,Homesexuals and Prison Inmates-give me a break-John Grisham please don't make a movie out of this one"
3,Hated the ending!,"Not his best novel, but a good read! Loved the two plots he had going on and the relevance of the political theme. Sadly, this book had no ending, so that was disappointing. Still for true Grisham fans, it was worth the money!"
3,the brethren,Although I enjoyed the book it was not as riveting as his others. John wrote a book that seemed out of character for him. It was more of a cloak and dagger book rather than the legal maneuvering & genius that we are used to.
2,Waiting...,"I have all of Grisham's works and have enjoyed all of them; however, The Brethren, was quite a disappointment. The frustrating part is that it had all of the makings of an excellent book, but it did not have a build up of excitement nor did it end with an unpredictable conclusion. I will continue to read his books, but I have to say this was not one of his better works."
1,Where's the meat?,Disappointing! I'm an avid fan and grabbed the book the first day it was on the shelf. Two weeks later I was FINALLY finished.I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the other books that John Grisham has authored. This one seemed like a hurried attempt to put something out. The prison/political sub-plot was confusing and the outcome became pretty obvious.I sincerely hope that the next book returns to the same style of old.
2,Just cranking them out? ....,"John Grisham's lastest novel has great potential...a good story line, an interesting mix of characters, and even the right policital timing - but what happened? Although the book starts out well, as the two stories begin to intertwine, the novel just slips and fades away. Attempts at humor appear sarcastic and cynical. There's no true charater development, no exciting climax, and often the story draggs- not going anywhere. I stuck it out, hoping for some of John's typical twists or surprises or excitment, but no such luck. The whole book had a ""manufactored"" feel to it....just cranking out the next one so he could pick up the check. It could have been a great novel."
2,Ends poorly and the premise has a hole in it too!,"Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I agree with many of the reviewers that the ending was a complete dud! Possibly not as apparent except to political junkies such as myself, was a flaw in the premise as well. There is no way a candidate for President who doesn't even announce until after the New Hampshire primary would be able to meet the filing deadlines in many of the other primaries which follow close behind. Maybe we could extend a little literary license if the story had other redeeming features such as strong characters or a sizzling climax but this one misses the mark all around."
1,That's It!,"Wasn't a whole lot to it. Interesting premise that didn't go anywhere, and an ending that was lacking. Exceptionally predictable from the start."
2,Where is the hero?,This book definitely does not live up to Grisham's usual standards. I kept waiting to like one of the characters and never did. The character depth is just not there. I give it two stars because I expected much more and was disappointed.
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I loved Grisham's other books, so I didn't hesitate to pick this one up. I'm sure The Brethren will find its own audience, but that doesn't include me, unfortunately. I guess it's impossible to keep up the pace of nail-biting intrigue!"
1,He keeps getting worse,Grisham should have quit a few books ago. You can tell he only writes for the money.
3,"Not the Grisham book of old, but still a good book","I just finished reading The Brethren tonight. It is a good book with some interesting plot twists, but all in all it's not nearly as good as his older books, such as The Firm or A Time to Kill. I labored over giving the book four stars, but it's definitely a 3 star book. The story started out like it was going to get very suspenseful, but it just never really developed like his other books. You know how you can be reading another book and all of a sudden you realize it's 2am and you can't put the book down, even though you have 200 pages left? This isn't one of those books, but it held my attention while reading. I would recommend this book to the faithful readers of John Grisham."
2,grisham delivers another disappointment,"I loved john grisham and waited anxiously for his next novels after reading his first 7 books. BUT starting with the street lawyer, he began getting away from the courtroom and things went downhill from there for me. I didn't enjoy the testament and I REALLY didn't enjoy the brethren. I hope he gets back to what he does best--courtrooms/trials. which is why I enjoyed him in the first place."
3,A simple book,"A quick read, something that doesn't seem to have taken any strain to write. A convenient oh-so-smiley ending. No intense action, but a pleasant way to spend some reading time if you're in the mood for something light."
1,Disappointed,"I've been a John Grisham fan since his early days, but I'm having trouble getting through this book. It is definitely not one of his best. I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Pelican Brief"" but I can't see me finishing this one. I just can't get into it. My husband feels exactly the same way. I came here to see if we were the only ones with this opinion, but there are a few others who have the same thoughts."
3,Just wasn't what I thought,"I have read better books by John Grisham. It might have been the subject matter that disappointed me the most. Once I began reading I did read it to the end but I wasn't impressed with the book at all. The plot was good but the subject matter was not a favorite of mine.I enjoyed The Firm, The Testament, and Pelican Brief much more."
2,Decline in quality,"I've been a big fan of John Grisham since The Firm. I've read all his books, but by the time The Testament came around I have to admit he's lost steam. The Brethern is even worth. If you've read any of Grisham's previous books and want to read this one out of royalty, expect to be disappointed."
4,This guy Grisham is good!,"Yeah, we all know Grisham is good -- with all his young lawyer sagas. But this one differs a little from the others. It's got a fascinating premise, well-drawn characters, and some pretty tense plot points. It takes place (mostly) in a prison, where we see the brethren's machinations so clearly it's as if we're watching them with a camera. The brethren are brought to life on the tapes well by Michael Beck, but the star is the plot. Grisham's plot twists are so good that there was at least one moment when a surprise event made me audibly gasp. I like that in a book! The best thing I can say about a book on tape is that when I got home from work I didn't want to get out of the car until I listened to ""just a little more."" With this one, I did that for several days!"
2,Crime Pays!,"I really enjoyed reading Grisham's earlier novels. I did not enjoy this one. This novel followed the same new pattern that Grisham uses...crime pays. This novel does nothing more but reiterate that the American Government is crooked and in the end it is all right to do wrong, because heck, you will get away with it. If you really have to read all of Grisham's novels go ahead, but, it's all claptrap."
4,WILL BE A WONDERFUL MOVIE,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK. VERY CAPTIVATING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE 3 STARS AND LESS GIVERS ARE TALKING ABOUT. DID THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE GAY ASPECT OF IT OR THE POLITICS?. THIS IS A GOOD BOOK. PLEASE BUY IT bUT IN ALL HONESTY, BUY THE PAPERBACK. HIS CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED AND THE SETTING CAN BE VISUALIZED. WHEN THE MOVIE COMES OUT, PLEASE (PRODUCERS)REWRITE THE ENDING IF THAT IS POSSIBLE. Thank you."
2,The ending --- What ending,"This is by far the worst books he has written. Not much an ending at all. Why he makes the us read through 300+ pages is a mystery to me. Grisham might need to read a few Tom Clany books, the CIA is weak and non-active in its time on need. Average story line, could of had been charters... Trevor the lawyer was the only interesting person in the book. Do not buy this one..... Don't wait for the Movie."
2,Very disappointing,"Unsavory, unbelievable plot and unsavory, unbelievable characters. This is a real disappointment coming from Grisham. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,The Brethren,"easy reading, fast story telling and good for weekend reading. But there is no climax, and it's awful ending. I still don't get what is his point. I have to say that this is the worst book he has written ever. I guess I expected too much for John Grisham."
2,I'm missing a chapter,"As a Grisham fan,I have read all of his books and can never wait till the following March,except for 2001. At first I found it kind of slow then, suddenly all the pieces fell together, was I ever wondering what would happen? Needless to say, I'm positive that my book is missing the last few chapters."
3,"Up, up, up, up, up-DOWN","This is the third Grisham book I have read or listened to via audio.His books are well thought out . . . meticulous to the last detail.However, what happened to ""The End"" of the Brethren? I absolutely hated the ending. He had me throughout the entire book, and then bam, the end. Very anticlimatic. Will think twice about reading another one."
1,"Disappointed, a little surprised","I'm not sure why I buy Grisham's books every time a new one comes out, but I haven't missed one yet. And there not that great, but almost always entertaining. That is not the case with the Brethren. This book has almost no redeeming qualities and reads as if Grisham didn't even enjoy it. There is virtually no plot and the characters are as unlikeable asany I've ever read. His previous novel, the Testament, showed a promising new side of Grisham. Combined with presidential intrique I expected a good read. Sorry."
1,what a letdown,"The Brethren started off well and then seemed to lose momentum. I found myself waiting for a climax than never came. Im not sure if it was a matter of a rushed ending or just a poorly developed plot. Whatever the case, I was quite disappointed with this one."
1,Not his best but possibly his worst,It appears John grew tired and wrote an ending just to stop the pain of continuning a story line that was weak.
1,Worst Ever,"I have read all of Grisham's work and I am sorry to say I paidfor this junk. It make no since and I was so upset at trying tofigure it out. I could have thrown it away. Everyone I have talked to feels the same and the bad thing if this was the first of his books you have read, you might think all the others are this bad also. not so. END"
2,Good Message Blocked By Poor Filming,"This film has a great message that needs to be told. However, some poor filming techniques really get in the way. The narration is AWFUL! I understand that this young man wanted to tell his own story, but he would have been better off finding someone with a less grating voice. Also, some of the narration is downright corny. This really detracts from the message. The film also uses really corny music while showing sharks being killed. They should have enlisted the help of professional writers and directors to give this documentary a polished look so more people would take it seriously."
4,Sharkwater,"I like to eat shark fin soup until I read reports and watch this title.. This show speak a loud for Sharks.It is a wake up call for humans. I am not only concerning about sharks but all other animals too. Eg Tigers hunted for the skin and other product, Fur creatures skinned for their furs.(Just to name a few.) This young man risk his life to produce this show to warn all of us, The message is simple. Do not upset of food chain of the ocean as Sharks has live in the ocean longer than any of us. It is maintained the food chain of the ocean well until man started to hunt them for their fins. If the world comes to an end, it is not God's ideal but we end this mother world by ourselves.Be kind to animals as we are all created by God."
4,9 year old girl loves it.,"Once removed from it's packaging this toy dog was a joy for my 9 year old daughter. My daughter would give it 5 stars, but I took away 1 star for the packaging, which requires you to totally destroy the package to access the dog and of course void any attempt for returning it. Lucky for Techno my daughter loved it, I honestly don't think it does much, but my daughter loves it and that's all that matters."
4,Cute and informative.,I purchased this book for my three African American daughters so that they could learn how to understand the unique texture of their hair. Since reading the book they have all started flat ironing their own hair and maintaining it between trips to the beauty salon.
5,Truly the best of Redbone,"If you can afford or find it, this is truly the very best of Redbone - 20 tracks of shear joy including the virtually unavailable ""We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee"". The latter track is unavailable in North America, and cannot be found on the ""Essentials"" or other ""Best of"" ""Classics of"" etc. collections."
1,Best of Redbone isn't Leon Redbone,"For some reason, this CD comes up with the Leon Redbone CDs, and I see I was not the only one to order this CD when I was intending to order a Leon Redbone CD. Be careful Leon fans, this is not the one you want!"
2,Disaapointing,"I had hoped this ""chest"" would turn my students on about Shakespeare and the Globe. Pieces were missing from the Globe puzzle, which was quite small, and it was scant on background facts."
1,Twice No. --Poems for little people.,"This, among books this reviewer has bothered to purchase from a bookstore new, is the SOLE volume I've ever taken back out of disgust. Banal, boorish, vapid, insipid: If I continue, there will be a Thesaurus entry of Babel for ""Garbage"" as a metaphor. --And I was led to believe Allen Ginsberg&CO.;, followed by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., with Herman Melville and Saul Bellow taking up the rear were the main gods of the Anglophone pantheon of overrated writers. I see now that was quite mistaken; they were mere ciphers.--Hail Caesar: W H AUDEN. The quintessential 'English Man'. . . romantic eunuch, milchsop, bore. He will have no ciphers since he's etched his texts on the bottom of the well . . . all roads lead AWAY from Auden . . . CS Lewis is more compelling, even as a proselytizing fantast . . ."
3,More than just C please!,"I am convinced that Linus Pauling offers some wonderful advice in this book, however my major complaint is that it is so entirely focused on the benefits of vitamin c that the other vitamins he recommends in his supplementary regime barely get a look in. His regime recommends quite high doses of vitamin E and A as well, and I would have liked more information on the safety and benefits of these vitamins especially A, which I had previously thought was toxic in large doses. The edition I have is from the 1980s so maybe this has been updated?In any rate, I have started taking 9g of vitamin C per day for my frequent colds, so I'll see if it helps!"
2,sorry,"Sorry, I simply don't like his voice! I know they say kindness comes through the voice, but if it wasn't for the ambient music I would have not been able to just listen to the voice. I am new to meditation and at least expected something better from one of the world's best selling self-help audio maestro. He cannot pronounce some of the words, I found his heavy cockney English accent distracting. I think he sounds more like a good-natured and artful cockney grocer. Apart from that it's hard to fault what he says, it's just the voice saying it. Please don't get me wrong, I love EastEnders, but not while listening to this. It wouldn't have been so bad if he had just a ""southern"" accent, but it is just too heavy for me to get away with and feel what he is saying carries any validation."
3,Nice but didn't last,"I enjoyed this for a few months. The color is great, but the finish on the inside bottom cracked and splintered off. I like the look of this bowl and wish it would have lasted longer."
2,Factory Seconds!!,"I've had this set for years and love it, so when I broke a bowl and bought a few to add to the set I was shocked. AMAZON IS SELLING SECONDS AS IF THEY'RE REGULAR DISHWARE!!The set is ivory with rust colored highlights. The bowls that I recieved are, if fact, ivory, but the rust is either on part of the bowl (bottom only) or not at all. The highlights are supposed to be irregular, but not only on the bottom of the bowl.If you have the set these will not match. If you just want a pretty, sturdy, off-white bowl it's great."
5,Well Made,I've been very happy with this skimmer. It's well made and will probably be in my kitchen for many years. It's large but I didn't find that to be a problem. I can use it to stir my pasta and drain it. I don't need to take out a colander anymore. One less thing to wash.
1,Absurd Conclusion,"As I have commented on other Nero Wolfe books by Robert Goldsborough, his depictions of the characters--Wolfe, Archie, Fritz, and so on--are shallow. But it was the plot that I hated in this novel. I was hard-pressed to finish the lackluster story and now wish I didn't. The conclusion was abrupt and out of left-field."
2,The Rainbow Fish and Dazzle The Dinosaur,"I just bought this video for my 2 year old and I'm so disappointed. We just love the board book Rainbow Fish, so I assumed, wrongly so, that this video was age specific, and therefore perfect for her. It has two scary scenes with a big toothed shark chasing Rainbow Fish as well as a snaggly toothed dinosaur who roars and tries to get Rainbow Fish. It starts with Rainbow Fish being so unkind to his fellow ocean creatures. Even though the ending teaches a lesson, it comes too late into the story, and appears to be insincere. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
3,more beer please...,"Mr. Jackson in front of the camera is not as exciting as the Mr. Jackson who writes so well in praise of amber nectar. The video is dated and lacks the excitement of many of todays lifestyle type shows. I thought even Jackson would have said a 45 minute video is not enough to discuss the Lambic beers of Belgium, never mind the rest, not to mention the northern neighbours. It leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied taste in the mouth..."
4,Good product,"This is a cheap but OK cd player. The edges of the body are not so smooth, but the quality of the sound is nice. I will recommend this player to others."
1,tendentiuos propaganda,"It has been over a decade since I read Scheer's ill-informed diatribe against defense in general and Reagan in particular. I don't normally pan books that I read, but I make an exception in this case because it is so awful -- deserving zero stars were such a measure available.Having worked in the defense industry for years, being patronized by a liberal Clintonist flak does not increase my appreciation for the author's arrogant nonsense. His ""facts"" are uniformly wrong and his conclusions unfounded. But _Shovels_ does reveal a characteristic of liberal ""journalists"" that was refreshing -- the author includes his interview with Reagan in which he repeatedly interrupts the then-candidate for president. In particular I recall Sheer's moral equivalism between occidental republics and Marxist tyrannies and dismissal of the Soviet GULag. Since I have relatives who perished there, my sentiments to those who find socialist utopian fantasies enlightening is one of disgust."
5,Adventures and answers,"This is a must for anyone who believes in creation, evolution, ufo's, superhumans, dinosaurs, ancient civilizations, and for those who relish a challenge to your normal way of thinking. Even though this was published in 1977, it is amazing to see how deeply Rene's thoughts have come true and to the forefront in recent discoveries.If you desire a challenge, a need to know...this book is for you.The book I have was my father's. When he passed away, I took it, read it, read it again and was hooked from the beginning. It answered many questions and has driven me to look at many things in a new light. It is now a well worn book that I fiercely cherish. Any book that helps us learn something is worth keeping"
2,"Too single, busy, and broke for these recipes","Working with a tight budget and trying to eat right are very difficult. I was hoping that buying these cook books would help but for someone who has a very limited time to cook because they work 60-70 per week, this is not a great cook book. But to be fair, I've found it extremely hard to find one that is.This is just my impression since I was looking for very quick, painless recipes I could whip up, store, and use through out the week. I can't afford fancy spices or expensive cuts of meat and seafood. I also can't store veggies for very long because I am never really home to make them so they go bad and my money goes down the drain.I wish I could say this book worked for me but it didn't. I am certain that other folks have found it very helpful but I, unfortunately, did not."
1,full of smeared heavy underlining and writing not the author's .unable to read.,I believe in supporting used book dealers and used books but this went in the trash. I cannot believe someone thought this was usable. I couldn't find the author's words. No one should have bought or sold this copy.
5,Vitriolic Hatred From the Left Vented Here!,"Could it be these one-star ""reviewers"" are part of a vast left wing consipiracy? The posts read as though they're written by the same person - and boy is he/she angry!Relax! This isn't a political forum to dump venem on an author with whom you don't'agree. Get over it. Go take a cold shower or a hot bath.Oh yes, Dr. Hawkins' book does have a way of smoking out the seething opposition, doesn't it? I loved it."
5,Funny Episodes & Cool Extras,"This SpongeBob DVD has great episodes (like always), but as a change - the Special Features are getting better! SpongeBob DVDs always have cool episodes, but sometimes lack of Special Features. I can't say these Special Features are the best because they're not, but they're really good and give you a background on SpongeBob. They're a good amount of extras for the DVD, and even though they could have added more, it's a good amount and are really enjoyable. The episodes are very well chosen and can be enjoyed by all ages! Here are the episodes this product includes and the grade I think they deserve.1) Ripped Pants = A2) SB-129 = A3) Texas = A+4) The Graveyard Shift = A+5) Something Smells = A+6) Jellyfishing = A7) Dying For Pie = A+8) Wormy = A9) F.U.N. = A+10) Club SpongeBob = A+Also, three of these episodes (episodes 1, 3, and 9) have great songs sang by SpongeBob, Sandy, and SpongeBob and Plankton. Buy this volume to add to your collection!"
2,Spongebob Squarepants - Sponge Buddles;/Nautical Nonsense,"This DVD played for only 2 minutes and then is defective. Seller should have tested DVD first before shipping. Since I did not pay that much, I am not going through the hassel of return. Buyers be aware."
2,A Bit Over My Head,Another review warned thatExistentialism: A Beginner's Guide (Beginner's Guides)might be a better first step than this book (Irrational Man) orBasic Writings of Existentialism (Modern Library Classics).Reading Irrational Man I often felt like I was on the edge of a cliff frantically trying to get my footing. I think I'll have to try out some beginner's existentialism books now.
1,Piece of crap!,"I have had it in my hands for 3 days and it JUST popped apart and pieces went flying!I plugged it into my computer and pulled it to plug it into my phone... POP! Spring here, and 3 more plastic pieces there.It's not retractable anymore!GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Very pretty,"Nice pictures. A lil smaller then I thought they would be as they are advertised as ""posters"". They still look great in my kitchen. Very thin. They definitely need to be hung in a frame if you want them to last."
1,dont waste your time!!!,"At first apperarance this move seemed pretty cool, psychological thriller, deranged killer, mental hospital. But what actually transpired was pure low budget, poorly acted, contrived drivel! The plot was so predictable (ever hear of plot twists guys? thats what most psycho thrillers have!) As for the deranged killer, i thought i was watching one of those old Frankenstein monster movies from the 40's! all this guy need was the bolts in the neck! Lets not even talk about quality of acting, even for a 'B' movieDont waste your time buy Memento instead"
2,Not that bad,"This movie was ok. The acting was a little off in parts, thats what bothered me. And, all the killings are off screen, so it's a little weak. It also gets a little boring and ridiculously unbeleivable."
4,Regarding young children,I purchased this for the parents of my 15 year old grandson. The book is for parents with young children and is not appropriate for teenagers.
4,"Quiet, good power, good value.","I picked up my HF810 at one of the local Amazon assocites to replace an old box fan that had just given up the ghost. What a difference! This fan moves much more air with a fraction of the noise. The adjustible floor stand makes it easy to aim the fan without leaning it up against a chair or some other precarious pose. Pointed upward, it moves air as well as a ceiling fan.It's not perfect, but for the money it's a very good value. I plan on buying a second one soon."
4,This fan really blows!!!,"My wife and I got one of these fans on the cheap from our next door neighbors' yard sale. I think we spent $15.00 on it. Once we plugged it in and turned it on, we couldn't understand why they sold it! This fan blows so hard that when we put it on our linoleum floor and turned the fan on high, it blew itself across the floor and unplugged itself! Yes; it is inconvenient not being able to take the blades out for cleaning, but that is the only negative thing I can say about it. Just take it outside and blow it out with compressed air. Canned air is okay, but an air compressor is best."
5,"High praise, great product","I bought this product due to the high marks given by other Amazon users, and it did not disappoint. My 1928 Chicago bungalow has beautiful white subway tiles, and now the beautiful grout makes the whole bathroom look new. Easy to apply very low odor (that disappears), easy to wipe down.Highly recommend this product!"
1,I just gave up,"I was really excited to use this product and clean up my bathtub grout. I carefully read the instructions and I was ready to begin but I could not squeeze or push this bottle hard enough to get anything to come out! I eventually just gave up and re-grouted my bathtub instead. Next time I go to try this product, I will probably need to cut the top off the bottle and try to use a brush or other applicator instead. Very disappointing."
1,Didn't work,"I washed and scrubbed the grout really well before hand. I carefully followed all the directions. After applying this, the grout was still dark. It didn't do a thing."
1,Wellwisher,Sponge of this product wears out very fast. Application is not even. It works if you apply very well. Re think before you buy. You may have to use painting brush to even coats
3,Its nice,It seems well crafted but it is too long. I am 6 foot and my badge hangs to nearly my waist.
2,Too big,The string for this lanyard is VERY thick. More like a rope. Its still sitting in my locker as its size is obnoxious.
1,WARNING: Only for the Religious,Nowhere in the description do they tell you this book is filled with Christianity. My family and I are not religious and I was dissapointed to find out from my mother (after sending it to her for mother's day) that this book has references to God or the Bible on every other page.
1,For hobbyists only,"My ""garden"" is a balcony, 11 floors up, and I figured that a container gardening guide from Brooklyn would be just the thing for a city gardener like me. Alas, no. The book mainly features chapters by enhusiasts about their particular kicks: alpine gardening, classic (i.e., Greek-inspired) containers, etc. Yes, there's a final chapter with practical gardening advice about soil and plant care, but it's pretty generic. Unless you share the authors' specific passions, buy another guide."
1,Not the format stated by Amazon,This is more of a warning than a review. This disc is PAL format!! Not NTSC as Amazon states. I can only recomend this DVD to someone who owns a DVD player that accepts PAL format. Buyer beware!!
5,Hidden Parables.... a way of life?,"I am very much enjoying this book, and am actaully doing the suggestions. I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to know themselves better!To anyone who has not yet read it..... please read ""Evolution Angel."" It was written by the same author, but published under the pen name Dr. Michael Abrams. It is a wonderful book!"
2,Not the best,"These little books are pretty much a joke. Not much information or photos (it is a tiny, thin book.)"
3,game works fine.,I enjoy the game. i would have liked it if it came with a memory card. nothing is wrong with the game.
1,Kindle version defective,We were disappointed with this book. In the kindle version the illustrations are garbled. Redowloading doesn't fix anything the story stops in the middle at page 6 of 32. I should have bought the print version instead of the kindle version.
2,Big disappointment...,"Although this book contains a number of Frank Sinatra's great pieces, they are the original compositions that are sometimes very different from Frank Sinatra's versions that you are probably looking for."
3,Cute toy,"The kids enjoyed it, they picked it up to play with several different times, but one broke easily."
1,Upsetting,The item was not packaged properly and was sticking out of the box upon arrival. I was very disappointed in Amazon for selling a product in such a way.
5,Wonderful little book; something to live by,Everybody who wants to be a grownup will love this book. The Eschatological Laundry List at the back had lived on our fridge off and on for years.
4,This book was VERY helpful,"This book is full of lots of information that I needed. Because it was so informative, it reduced my phone calls to my friends and gave me info at my fingertips. I prefer the weekly format rather than the monthly format that other books have. I use this book along with another one (monthly). The two serve as my pregnancy resources. This will be my first child so I was full of questions and am very happy to say few were left unaswered."
3,"IF YOU LIKE EARLY 70's UNDERGROUND METAL, THIS IS FOR YOU","This album is a curiosity and also a reminder of what was going on the British scene after the demise of the second line up of Atomic Rooster. John Cann- guitar and Paul Hammond- drums, left the Rooster in 1972 after their highly successful album ""In Hearing Of Atomic Rooster"".Joining forces with John Gustafson- bass guitar, the trio released in 1972 their first album as Hard Stuff, ""Bullet Proof"", I highly recommend this album, that is if you can find it. As for their second album ""Bolex Dementia"" and last, which gladly is around, the trio continued with their intriguingly blend of Heavy Metal, British Blues and a touch of excentricity. This album is not for everyone, but just in case you're a fan of groups like Atomic Rooster, Edgar Broughton Band, Quatermass and Ian Gillan, surely you must get it, besides you'll own an album hardly anybody is aware of it's existence."
3,Second Harvest Pressing Is A Bootleg,"All 3 Hard Stuff albums are great... this one, Bulletproof, and the newly discovered Entrance To Hell (listed as by Bullet). And the Angel Air pressings are the best ones to get, with excellent sound quality. Same can't be said for these Second Harvest pressings. They're bootlegs made from vinyl. Why bother? Get the real thing on Angel Air."
2,no heat output,"I bought two of these inserts to fill fireplaces that have been capped off in an old house. The cords are very short & per the safety instructions you can't use extension cords to reach an outlet. The units look nice and provide ambience when it is dark. During the day they look exactly like what they are, fake. They do not put out any significant amount of heat. I tried to use it in my 6x4 hallway last week to take the chill off in the morning. It took three hours to raise that small room 10 degrees.Bottom line-if you are buying them just for decoration, great, you'll like them. If you want them to function as heaters, these are not for you."
5,Really Spectacular!,"I bought this Dimplex Insert for a fuel gel fireplace that I purchased on ebay that was absolutely gorgeous. But it had been modifed and came with electric logs. So, I found this unit, installed it myself, and I am amazed at how realistic the flames are! I have two other electric fireplaces that are not Dimplex flames, and I am thinking of selling them and buying more Dimplex. Quite unbelievable. I was startled."
4,Nice and easy.,"We purchased this through a local hardware store for $199.99. It easily fits into our fireplace and creates a nice amount of heat for our living and dining rooms. Our furnace isn't kicking on as often and our house still stays cozy. I do agree that the cord is too short and we have used a heavy-duty extension cord with no problem. I know that extension cords are supposed to be a no-no but, living in an area where it can be winter for 9 months out of the year (and using past trial and error) I feel certain the heavy duty extension cord will work fine."
4,Love Harry,"If you dont know Harry Bosch but like cop books, dont miss this one.If you know Harry,enough said.If your new to Michael Connellys Harry Bosch series,start from book one and enjoy them all."
3,Just getting started.,"After reading The Black Echo (Harry Bosch book 1) I had high hopes for this book. I admittedly prefer the plot in this book over the plot in The Black Echo, it's more believable to me. However, that being said I feel as though The Black Echo was a better book overall. This book seems to just ride off the first one instead of bringing a lot of growth to the story. I understand these aren't very character progressive books, they're cynical detective novels, but I was hoping for more. I can't exactly put my finger on why this didn't hit the spot like the first, but it just didn't. It's still a good read and I encourage you to take a look if you enjoyed the first one."
5,A Great Harry Bosch mystery!!!,"What starts out as a obvious suicide by a Los Angles narcotics officer, turns into a top notch Harry Bosch mystery. This one is a real page turner, that will take you to the darker side streets of L.A. to the poverty stricken border town or Mexacali Mexico. And all the way through you will be kept on the edge of your seat as you try to guess who is who. Michael Connelly has to be one of the best mystery writers around. His characters are so real and life like, it's as if they are just going to jump right off the page. I strongly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed."
2,Uninteresting,"The problem I had with this book was that I just couldn't make myself care about the case Harry was working on. Found myself skimming and skipping pages to get to the end. After reading and enjoying all of Connelly's Harry Bosch stories, I was surprised that this one was so uninteresting. I'm glad this was the last in the series that I read. If it had been the first, I doubt I would have wanted to read his other books. And that would have been a big loss."
1,Slow,"Very slow, not up to the standards of his other books, not one of his best, a big waste of time."
2,"don't worry, he's all better now","I was a big fan of Connelly after 2 other books (out of order) and was concerned when Black Ice fell flat for me. However, I think it really was soph. slump and Connelly has recovered nicely. It was tedious whereas his others are detailed and I decided one night I wasn't curious about anything and reading the rest felt like a chore. And that is a rare statment for me: I am the one everyone makes fun of for reading so much and for needing reading like breathing.Skip this and go to other Connellys, especially The Narrows."
3,Black Ice leaves one cold,"Another one of Connolly's books where all the answers are given in the last couple of chapters. I want to have insight into the characters and plot as I move along. I have read most all of the Harry Bosch series and there are a few that feel like, ""whew, I need to end this book somehow.""In this book he has killed the husband of the cop's wife, has a continuing relationship with her, living the lie. Nice going Harry.Connolly is a good writer, he sometimes doesn't know how to get off the stage. The Last Coyote and Angel's Flight are well done and worth reading."
2,This is what I say...,"I decided to order this video along with several others. The ordering was very fast and as always with Amazon, I had no shipping issues. The video started off SLOW. I won't give it all away but I found myself wanting more at the beginning. As the movie continued, it picked up but there was really nothing that kept me motivated to continue watching. I stuck it out through the singing and moving between scenes. Overall it was an ok show. I won't say it was the worst play I've ever seen all I'll say is, it did not keep my interest. NEOSOUL06"
4,All Music Guide to Classical Music,"Very good for the person who doesn't know anything or need to brush up on there facts, about classical music."
1,Not very good,"Don't listen to the comparison to Clan of the Cave Bear. COTCB is way out of the Mammoth Stone's league. I read this book ages ago and gave it away because I didn't like it at all, it's kind of weird and not very informative if you are seeking to learn about the ancient American peoples way of life.If you are looking for a book akin to the Earth's Children series then The Mammoth Stone is a complete waste of time."
3,"Good, but not good enough","This book is actually pretty hard to find these days. When I did finally get a used copy, I found the illustrations and information to be only OK as a reference point for continental drift and prehistory. I also found that the info on prehistoric animals barely touchs on each prehistoric period.I purchased the book for its continental drift information and maps. In this area, I am a little disappointed. The maps provided do not show the complete landmass of each period. Each map only shows half of the Earth, and the other half is never shown in a separate map. Not being able to see the whole landmass for each period is a little annoying given that this is the main purpose for the book.The book provides very general and unnecessarily incomplete information on prehistoric Earth's many ages."
4,Basic Knitting,"This is a book every knitter, beginner or advanced, should have in her/his knitting library. I'm sorry I didn't have it years ago, but even as an advanced knitter, when I bought this book I sat down, read it cover to cover, and penciled in my own notes in the nice wide margins put in the book for that purpose. This allows the knitter to increase the use of this book with one's own additions or even comments on things that don't work for you.One of the great hints she gives is on doing the brioche stitch. She simplifies it beyond anything I have seen elsewhere. I immediately did a child's cap following her advice and was very pleased with the outcome.This book has very clear instructions on how to do various techniques and is something a knitter can return to over and over.Priscilla Bouic"
3,A fun book to read,"I checked this out of the library after hearing so much about it. I think it is a book that I will add to my knitting library, but more for then enjoyment of Elizabeth Zimmerman's writing style and common sense, than for a knitting reference.This is definitely not a learn to knit book. I found the chapters on sweaters and other knitted items a bit vague. But, to be honest, I will probably never knit a sweater anyway; I'm more of an accessory, small item knitter.But, I'd buy the book for the first chapter alone. There are a lot of good tips and ideas in this chapter. And, I love her style of writing. You feel like she is sitting there talking to you, and she has so much common sense. She makes you realize that knitting is fun, that you don't have to do it just like the book says (not even hers), so just relax and create."
1,"Sorry, the book didn't do it for me",I often feel that I am the only non-EZ fan in the knitting world. The book didn't do it for me. I don't like steeks and the book did not convince me that they are anything laudable in making a sweater. I also dislike the cult following that has grown up around this woman. Her daughter has perpetuated it. The book is in my library but it did not inspire my knitting.
2,Knitting without Tears,E. Z. is a genius but it is worthwhile only for the TOMTEN JACKET instructions.
5,Really enjoyable read,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Elizabeth Zimmerman has such a distinctive way of writing - you feel like you are listening in to one of her workshops. An absolute bonus were the many tit-bits of insightful and clever ways of dealing with many day-to-day knitting issues. I especially liked her way of shaping shoulders - why had I not thought of this before? If you have been knitting for a while so you know which aspects of knitted garments don't seem ""quite right"", then you will gleam many practical gems from this book."
4,Wonderful primer for all knitters,"The mother of all knitting, Elizabeth Zimmerman is the ultimate source for all knitters, regardless of experience or ability. It is great to have this classic in such a comfortable format!"
5,"If I could have only 1 knitting book, this would be it.","This book will not only teach you the basics, but it will make you an insider to the mysteries of knitting. It will painlessly liberate you from being a slave to pattern directions. Before you know it, you will be making your own sweaters to your own designs. Get it!"
2,"NOT basic or easy to follow, contrary to what title says","I started knitting a few months ago and thought this could help me to get beyond scarves. I suppose it would if I were a sewing expert, but alas, I am not. I guess it's good for advanced knitters and designers, but not being born with natural talent for this, I need something more basic before I can comprehend this. If you're a beginner, save your money. I got more out of Stitch-n-Bitch and Leisure Arts pamphlets than I did from this book. Maybe I'll pick it up again in a couple of years."
1,cheese,"hokey, forced and even though the grandfather is one of my favorite actors, it is so patently moralistic. I don't care if ""real"" indians were in it - although it wasn't insulting it over-glorifies life in woods at that time."
1,"Little Tree, Big Controversy","This video, which is based on a fictional story often portrayed as an authentic autobiography, is one more example of ""playing Indian."" It would be nice to see this story left in the dustbin of history where it belongs, with more genuine stories of Native Americans getting attention. Personally, I don't want my kids reading or watching a story about Native Americans written by a notorious KKK member. The appeal of the book and the video should make readers and viewers question whether they are partaking of a myth. There are several good films about Indians. This isn't one."
3,The book was better,"Like Craig said, it doesn't follow the book. I can understand why film makers have to make changes to the story line to fit an entire book into a couple hours, but some changes here just didn't make sense. The story as told in the movie was certainly heart-warming and well done, but the way Carter originally wrote it is so much better I can't give this adaptation more than three stars. I wish this rendition was as faithful to the original as Clint Eastwood was with Carter's other book ""Gone to Texas"" when he turned it into ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."""
5,Beautiful movie teaching simple but profound values,"Wonderfully photographed, expertley directed and acted. The message is simple but true: Help each other through life with love and respect. A rare family movie. Some profanity but not gratuitous. Historically real and enlightening. Some scenes might be frightening to small children. It's been a long time since a movie has moved me like this one did. I think anyone eight years and older could appreciate this richly done story."
4,"It's good, but the book is better.","You'll miss the importance of the Native spiritual beliefs if you just watch this DVD. It is made for entertainment, and does well along that line. But, when Little Tree listens to what the tree says...well, that isn't included in the movie, just the book.The whole reason behind the name Little Tree is in the book."
4,Bacco Bucci Cora Oxford,"The shoe is designed to be longer than necessary for your foot and ""appears"" to be lower in height across the front of your foot than other shoes. It has a rather unique appearance. However, it is comfortable and I was looking for something a little different. I would buy it again."
5,ONE MMmmore THING....,THESE CHAN CARTOONS REALLY ARE ACTION PACKED ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE ENTIRE JONZ FAMILY! SO FUNNY IS NASTY GRANDFATHER & SO GIRLPOWERED IS LITTLE JADE... WE LOVE THIS DVD'S CHAN'S THE MAN!!!
2,Not what I expected,I have nothing bad to say about the quality or the sturdiness of the product. What I have issue with is the photo versus what I received. I really purchased the gloves for my son's Halloween costume. The gloves were to be used as part of the costume and needed to be just orange. Well I received the gloves and they substituted the gloves for a pair of orange & black camo cloves. Not what I needed. Plus the gloves arrived three days after Halloween so I could not use them after all.A better photo needs to be taken and posted. Maybe I'll do that.
3,Truely Bizzare,"This is a very strange recording. I won't say it's bad but I can't that it's good.The orcistration for this version where very bad. Most of the singers where very ametuer sounding. And the whole thing was very slow paced.I can say two good thing about this recording. Dave Clair's Herod was truely amusing (""your the king of bolonga"") and Kelly Hogan singing the part of Simon Zealots was fantastic, maybe the best.Overall, I just don't care for this version, but I know that some people would."
2,Well,"It's somewhat worth it if only for the interesting new arrangments, adding a fresh twist on how the music is played, I especially liked the pounding drums on many of the tracks and the retooling of the overture, but the performances really sink it. I doubt most Indigo Fans would really enjoy this. While an okay singer, Amy ray makes an unconvincing even laughable Jesus, and the rest of the cast is just as blah. Hard Core Indigo Fans might dig this. As for the JCS fanatics, well, let's just be glad those poundig drums I mentioned drown out most of the vocals."
3,"Good package, watch for dropped connections","Was a decent buy with $60 in mail in rebates from bestbuy's bf sales but I noticed that the router would keep dropping and restoring the connections, and this was a direct wired connection on my desktop.Tried to reset it with the paperclip and start over, no change. After poking around the web, I found that if I restored the device, then reverted to the 1.03 firmware, then updated to the newest 1.05 firmware, that has fixed it for now.As for setup on the laptop, make sure you uncheck let Windows manage the wireless connection and uses the Airlink software. Atleast in my area anyway.With NetStumbler I found 6 other various hotpoints and Windows would always pick another connection besides mine, although that could be good for Wardriving."
4,Old but good,"A bit outdated nowadays but a good image of the state of the art in computer networks a few years ago, a listing of all the computer networks in the world (Including all Internet networks) and contact information."
5,Thoughtful yet intensive,First Contact opens with a haunting melody hooking the listener to hear the Borg. The classic Star Trek theme provides the intensity and drama with a sense of heroism and boldness. Goldsmith continues the Star Trek saga beautifully.
4,Extended version a good pick,"The opening title to First Contact is bar none Jerry Goldsmith's best piece of music, which is why I purchased this CD as fast as I could. You can now navigate the movie from beginning to end in your head by sitting down to listen to this music. The bonus tracks are good as well as the liner notes. A must have for all trekkies."
5,A Very Pleasant Contact,"Jerry Goldsmith delivers a fantastic score, with music that stands alone as a wonderment of soundscapes.The juxtaposition of the numbers make for a solid delivery, as each build upon the colors already on the canvas. Main Title/Locutus aptly sets the tone, with The Dish, First Contact and End Credits the best of Goldsmith's entries. A neat bonus is Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride and Roy Orbison's Oooby Dooby.This rates very highly in the Goldsmith catalog of soundtracks and arguably the finest of his work in the Star Trek franchise."
3,The bags are only 2/3 the size of oem bags.....,"so you use MORE because they fill up FASTER. That's not really a bargain at all. But, since I ordered 36 bags, I'm committed to using them. No complaints w/. the seller tho - got mine in just a few days."
5,An enjoyment,I love all of Lynsay Sands books. This was no different. I love her mixture of romance and by humor. The dog Goliath was my favorite character. I enjoyed it.
4,Liked it,I love Lynsay Sands historical. This was humorous and fun to read. The conflict between the two characters make it a light and fun book to read.
2,some funny bits,"this is a so so book. it is the kind of book i buy when i am desperate to read something anything!! the back cover descriptions made it look interesting but it really wasn't. thepranks at first where funny then they just got too silly. i find that the author has a very poor editor...who believes that someone in that age would call their mother ""mom"" or usemodern expressions of sarcasm like 'oh just great'. little details like that tend to annoy me. little or no sexual tensionand unbelievable plot threads. this is the first time i read tis author and i won't be making that mistake again."
2,Poor Quality-Poor Service Support,"Purchased a new Artixscan 1800f last January. I suspect that it was defective, since I had problems with the lamps from the beginning. Due to my very intense work schedule, I was unable to arrange for warranty service until last week. Microtek would not honor the warranty but wanted $400 to swap the unit for a refurbished one. Granted they would pay shipping, but, honestly, is it worth the price and is this the kind of service consideration one expects from a so-called ""high-end"" company. I am buying a new Epson in hopes that they will provide some latitude and discretionary consideration for this kind of expensive equipment."
1,Stay away from Microtek!!!!!!!!!!!,"My experience with Microtek has been a nightmare. They are rude and of no help whatsoever. When I received the scanner the inside of the glass was dirty so I called Microtek (no toll-free number) and was told to remove the top four screws and the top of the scanner would come off and I could then clean the glass. I did exactly that and the power button fell off and was broken. I then emailed them explaining the problem and they told me that my warranty was void and that I physically abused the machine!! In addition to that I attempted to purchase the parts and was told ""we do not sell parts for our machines"". What? So if you purchase a Microtek scanner and the warranty runs out, you are screwed. MICROTEK IS THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY 40 YEARS IN BUSINESS."
2,Fool's Gold,"I like Whiskeytown.I like Ryan Adams.I like Heartbreaker.I do not like Gold.I don't know why.A friend of mine said ""it sounds like Poco"".I think he might be right."
2,Disappointed...,"As a huge Whiskeytown fan, I ran to the record store to pick upa copy of ""Gold."" If only it had been worth it.Gone are the country influences which made Whiskeytown standout, and in their place is a weak, uninspired folk-rock record.My only hope is that this record will be an anomaly in Adams'scareer, and he will get the hell out of LA, away from AdamDuritz, and back to the music that he does best."
4,One star? You must be kidding!,"You really have to wonder about these ""reviewers"" who give this CD one star. They must be very cynical, unhappy people, who get their kicks putting things down. I guess they're trying to show us how ""cool"" they are, when, in reality, their reviews only serve to make them look stupid. This CD has a great, fresh sound and has some absolutely terrific cuts -- ""New York, New York,"" ""Somehow, Someday,"" ""Gonna Make You Love Me"" -- to name a few. It deserves all the praise that it has received."
5,RYAN ADAMS IS PURE GOLD!,"Ryan Adams is such a gifted musician, singer, and songwriter. His poetry is right up there with Bob Dylan. His punky country music is just the right mix to make me absoloutely addicted to his music. I HIGHLY reccomend it. There are so many absoloutely kick [rear] songs on it that it's hard to choose a favorite. Ryan's guitar playing is magical, and he's has got the sexiest voice to go with his mind blowing songs! The guys a musical genius. ! BUY THE ALBUM!"
5,Best songwriter.,"This album is absolutely the best album made in years. The disc hasn't left my player since i got it in February. Ryan Adams will it is true that he draws influences from Dylan, Neil, and the Stones, he is not a cheap imitation of those artists. He is completely orignal... at least in my opinion. His first solo album Heartbreaker was good but this album blows that one away.I hear he is going to release some new harder stuff under a new band named ""Pinkhearts"". Supposedly it or they (more than one album?) will be released on September 24. So keep an eye out for it. And Buy this album you'l fall in love with it."
5,Amazing,"There is nothing I have ever heard that is more incredible than this CD. Ryan Adams is a genious. He is the only person that is able to get by with what he does and he knows it. This is the only album I can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of. There just aren't enough words to describe this brilliant record. Check out track 11, Gonna Make You Love Me. That is the best song ever recorded!"
5,My Favorite Album!!,"I have never written a review on here before but I knew that I had to after I got this CD. I originally bought the CD because I heard ""La Cienega Just Smiled"" and ""Harder Now That It's Over"" on the TV show Felicity. Then I kept hearing a lot about Ryan Adams so I decided to go out and buy the album. I am soo glad that I did!!! It is always in my CD player and there are songs on this album to fit any kind of mood that I am in. There is something unique and enchanting about each and every song. The lyrics are so thought provoking and refreshing. I love all the songs but my favorites are ""New York, New York"", ""La Cienega Just Smiled"", ""Answering Bell"", ""Rescue Blues"" and ""Harder Now That It's Over."" I honestly recommend this album to everyone!! I think Ryan Adams is incredibly talented and I can't wait until his next album comes out!!!"
3,Part 2 of Universal Soldier 3 Unfinished Business 7.5/10 part 1 is on Universal Soldier 3 region 2 DVD reviews,Back to my review. So Luc wants to get CIA director Resco & uncover the UNI SOL project. The ending has a almost Illuminati syle to it. I liked these movies I thought that Chandra West was better than Alley Walker no joke. Jeff Wincott wasn't to bad Gary Buesy was great I thought that Burt Reynolds needed more screen time but he was good none the less Matt Battagila's acting was wooden but it was better in part 3. I don't know why they reshot the Deverux Scott fight from Universal Soldier 1 for the begging of Universal Soldier BIA. The action was lacking in part 2 part 3 had a bit more the official sequel with Van Damme had a ton of action but I prefer these unofficial sequels over the official sequel.
2,should have ended a year ago,"after an awesome 4th season and almost past midseason on the 5th season, its really sad to say this show should be put to rest for good,the storylines are absurd,no real funny moments,all the ladys are simply boring,even eva longoria who is by far the funniest. i really think they should end this series in the sixth season and bring back fan favorites like susan daughter and bree's daughter. i heard they wanna prolong this until 2013,and i dont even want to imagine what kinda show would that be by then,expecially after losing edie and a mistery thats so beyond stupid and predictable it hurts. anyway we'll see"
4,dragonlady,"It was a bit more teary than I prefer (hence lacking one star) but still very enjoyable. A good series! Hopefully it won't follow the usual hollywood tract and forget that it's a comedy, becoming too serious and lecturing."
2,The Red Hot Edition? More like The Hard Times Edition,"I personally love Desperate Housewives. I had a huge problem with Season 5, but because of my love for the show, I still have an interest in it, and I'm willing to give it another chance for Season 6. I agree with a lot of the reviewers about the repetitive story lines and lackluster plots. Everything seemed to be put together in a very sloppy manner and quickly. The 100th Episode should have been amazing, instead it was just ok. Plus, who in the world was Eli Scruggs? Nothing was extremely interesting about this season and the mystery was boring and dragged out way to long. If it was 13 or 14 episodes then maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. But I went through this season begging for it to wrap up. I enjoyed the mysteries from seasons 1-4 and then in 5, it was like the writers gave up. I don't see how anyone can say they absolutely loved this season."
4,Read it in a week,"If you enjoyed Liar's Poker or When Genius Failed you will enjoy this book too. Some authors are very good at teaching you about a complex subject while making an entertaining book, this one succeeded at that. Only about 200 pages, informative but also easy to read, you will finish it very soon after starting."
4,tight little movie,"dead on, story takes place on the street corner, right at home....right where evil is under your eyes. Real period piece, extremely clever, understated. A sleeper! Not the usual fare."
4,"Set in wartime, but still a message for our time","Larry Newman, played by William Macy, lives a quiet and well-ordered life in New York towards the end of WWII. He works as a personnel man, lives with his mother, and has not gotten married because he's ""too busy working and paying for (his) house"". Suddenly his world falls apart when he witnesses the beating of a young Puerto Rican girl by a neighbor, and is demoted in his job because he has new glasses which make him ""look Jewish"". He meets and marries a young woman who is often mistaken for being Jewish and thus opens himself up for attack by the Union Crusaders, one of whom is his next-door neighbor, Fred. From a quiet beginning, the movie moves quickly to violence and hatred, and a man caught in the middle of it all. William Macy does a convincing job of showing the transformation of a shy man who doesn't want to become involved to one who is not afraid to stand up for his beliefs."
2,"Okay, but VERY techincal","If you are looking for video of actual bomb tests, this video is NOT for you. It is basically actual D.O.D reels declassified. It shows many in-depth testing measuring blast waves, heat etc. Good if you are of the sceintific nature, but gets a little boring if you are just looking for some 'action'."
2,:(,Good movie expecialy for a foreign film. But if you plan to watch it for the music (like I did) don't waste your time. Instead Buy PVD - Global DVD and watch the 4-5 min Zurdo trailer as it is FAR FAR FAR better then the movie itself and plays the full (and best song) Animacion.
4,Good value,"I've owned three of these heat guns. They work well, and are a good value for the money. The variable heat gives you all the control one needs. A good buy."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I am a chandler and always have a problem with wax dripping onto the sides of the container when I pour my jar candles. I have tried direct heat, boiling hot water, and just about anything else I could think of to clean up my containers. I ordered this to see if it would help, and it does a wonderful job! Whether I am cleaning up containers after a messy pour, or having to fix a candle when I need to melt out some air bubbles, this gun does a GREAT job!!!:)It's a great investment if you are looking for something that heats evenly, safe to use, and won't break your bank. You really need to try this product!"
5,Good dessert,"We love Warm Delights, the Lemon is our favorite. They are individual desserts but we usually split one between us. It makes just enough to eat and since none is left over, no over indulging. Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too."
1,A Real Blooper,This is not a blooper video. It was all old hockey footage with nothing funny in it at all. Many of the video clips (at least 8) were repeated throughout the video. Save your money and watch ESPN instead!
3,Just o.k.,"Just o.k.I was hoping for good examples of different kinds of dance moves. For instance, I would have liked to see the teacher show the kids first how it is done at adult level then have kids follow along at kid level. This taught some moves but not well enough for my 2 and 5 year-old boys to actually follow along consistantly."
5,Expert Shopper,Product was as expected and arrived very promptly. Granddaughter is very happy to dance to the video. It will provide many hours of entertainment and a very good way to begin her dance experience as she is only 2 years old. I would buy from this seller again.
3,It is adorable. . .,"We had rented this video from the library about a year ago, since then we have moved to a country were libraries are not available to us. We find that we missed this video and wanted to see it again. It's in endearing little show that helps body shy children focus of themselves and think about the gentley adminstrated dance moves."
5,Highly recommended,"Most of the songs are fairly simple, yet this album is a masterpiece. I first heard it almost 20 years ago, and it still sounds fresh, sincere and warm; I have heard it thousands of time and never get tired of it. Mr. Sanchez has done several other great albums, but there is a sense of innocence in this one that still stands out."
5,great read,still reading i pick it up two to three time a day it give you recipes for health foods you can try it has love cycles in there for u and your mate. so many diferent thing you can learn about your self and your people
1,Let Sanity Reign,You'd be crazy to pay this price for a $3.50 toy. Don't support the greed of this vendor! Let him sit on these a while and you'll be amazed how quick the price will drop.
5,"Excellent, but wish I would have bought bigger...",I am very pleased with this purchase. It made a big difference in my Dell desktop's functioning. Programs ran slightly slower and networking was a pain before installation. Now things are running much better. I noticed a difference immediately. This product was easy to install and the price was right. I only wish I would have purchased more MB.
5,Trooper,"This is a great iron. I got mine in 2005, and at one point the cord connection broke because i had it at the bottom of a backpack full of textbooks. I rigged it up with a shoelace and it worked for another 5 years. I have really thick greek hair and it did a great job."
2,Acceptable first novel,"I found this novel acceptable for a first novel. I would say that the author shows promise. The novel has some historical inaccuracies that most people wouldn't spot. The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that almost 40% of this short novel isn't story-- it's saying either how good Christianity is, or how bad atheism is. If the goal of the author is to try and convert atheists, I doubt he will have much success since most probably wouldn't finish the book.However, like I said before, the story itself (when the author chooses to pursue it) wasn't that bad for a first novel. I have read worst."
5,Most Excellent!!,"As a longtime Weather Report fan, I of course had to get this. What is great is just how much I like it. Two longplaying discs of quite impressive renditions of WP played by excellent musicians lending their own bent and air.My hesitation at first due to the fact that this is a tribute album were swept aside from the first song, this is some great stuff here!After a good 9 or 10 months of listening to this, all I can say is that it is still in my top 3 discs to just throw on and enjoy.The recording quality is very good. Excellent entertainment value IMO."
1,Battery life claims are no where near true,"I have 2 of these (and got one replaced). All 3 have HORRIBLE battery life. I have to recharge every day and a half, after only 20 mins of talk time in that day and a half, and the rest stand by. 7 hours talk and 14 days standby is a huge lie. I could see recharging every 3 days with modest use, but this is pathetic.If my batteries are bad and others are fine, it is weird since all 3 of mine are like that.Be aware."
1,Badly Written,"As much as I love Norse mythology, I just couldn't finish this book; it's just too badly written. It reads like it was written by a high school student with a good imagination, but one who has spent more time playing D&D; than actually practicing the skill of writing.The writing is careless, clunky, and clumsy, and Reichert's many mistakes and stumbles in the simple details make it impossible to suspend disbelief in the fantasy aspects of the story. There's no sense of place, and not much more sense of character, just a long series of events.Don't waste your time on this book."
4,A standard,"Sabiston contains both basic science and clinical information, but you'll still need both a basic science book (for more detail) as well as another clinical book (Cameron's is great) to get a more detailed and balanced exposure to the broad field of general surgery. As big, ""standard"" texts go, it's a good one. I think it has better detail in most sections than Schwartz. Some people prefer Greenfield's - I don't have that one, so can't comment. I have used Sabiston as my major reference through-out surgery residency, and can recommend it to you."
4,Good size,"I am a petite size women so this bra seemed big like a full coverage bra unlike the picture on the model. Despite the full coverage aspect of the bra the cups fit well, are not padded, and the straps are comfortable. I wish this bra came in other colors but I wear this bra on a regular basis."
2,Playtex review,"I am very dissatisfied with my purchase. I have bought this exact style of bra in the past, however this one is different in that the elastic feels old. It is not very stretchy at all.Would not purchase again."
2,I don't like it because,I have to start by saying that the seller sent the bras on time and they were neatly packaged.In my first review of the bra I said they were great but I had done the review before I had actually worn it for a couple of times. After actually wearing the bra I realized that the bandsize of it was too large (my fault) and the straps were too long and could not be adjusted to make them shorter. I never had a bra that you couldn't adjust the straps!! They kept falling down. I had to keep the one I wore of course but did send back the second one. I would buy from this seller again but NOT these particular bras.
1,4 arrived w/ shipping damage,"Like others, I went through returns/exchanges of this cooler, due to damage acquired during shipping. Amazon finally gave up and gave me a refund, after 4 attempts. The shipping box is composed of just too thin of a cardboard (and they only cover the glass door with a sheet of styrofoam no more than 0.25 inches thick). I noticed that each replacement shipment (sent via UPS air) arrived in worse shape than the original (which was shipped via ground). Luckily for me, I have a concierge that dealt with the UPS carrier pickups (of the damaged returns) and dropoffs (for the replacements). Possibly better off dealing locally, where you can actually inspect the item before taking it home."
2,Really tiny!!!,The product is cute and really small but I love the saying. I think it should come in larger sizes.
3,Fun times.,"A good series if you like shameless fanservice, fighting girls, and comedy in your anime, all running amok under a decent plot line. :] Beautiful (unforgetable!) artwork on the separate volume sleeves."
5,Finally!,"Been using the 18V DeWalt tools on the job where we put them through hell. Yes, we smoked some drills and fried some batteries but the tools went down fighting. Been watching the sales at Lowe's & HD hoping to finally get myself a good set of cordless tools for the house. I have to tell you, this kit at this price on Amazon....well, I couldn't match it anywhere else. I don't know how they do it but Amazon always seems to have what I'm looking for at very attractive pricing. Anyway, I finally have a kit that has everything I wanted and more. You'll wonder how you lived without a right angle drill. Only complaint is that the portable light is pretty much a waste - would have preferred a jigsaw. I know folks have complained about the 18V batteries not lasting but I've never had that problem. Just wish they weren't so expensive to replace when they do finally die."
3,Practice tests are lacking,"When compared to the Princtons review book, I found that the tests in the Barrons book were too easy. The rest of the book is well laid ou though and explanations are clear and concise. I took the micro and macro tests in may 06 and got 5s on both. But this was mostly because of the princeton book & going online to the ap website.macro: http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/members/article/1,3046,152-171-0-2083,00.htmlmicro: http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/members/article/1,3046,152-171-0-2084,00.html"
4,Poor Quality Binding,"While this book may be a good read, I'll never know because the pages have fallen out of the book like leaves, from the first moment I opened it. I've spent much time trying to retrieve and organize the wayward pages, to allow me to read what might be an interesting story. I have personally never experienced such a shoddy product."
4,Beautiful Lies,I chose this as I'm a big fan of EM and this book is written about Australia. I was hooked from the start and couldn't put it down. Loved it.
3,Good Wires for the money,"This product works well. The amp gets the power it needs. However, i had to buy a new fuse holder, because the one that came with the wires was broken...Also, if you have a fullsize car you might want to look at getting some longer wires...Mine barely reached my trunk"
5,Everything you need to hook up your amplifier,"If you do not want to spend a fortune on an expensive amp. hook up kit without sacrificing hardy anything in quality, this is hard to beat. It has everything, down to wire ties and grommets, to hook up your amp.I really liked the shield-twisted blue RCA cable for low-level inputs. Keep in mind that at 17 feet of length, the RCA and the blue turn-on cable may be a little short for some vehicles. The 4-gauge power and ground cable are adequate for most amplifiers. The kit comes with a 60A fuse, which may not be good for a small amplifier with a 25 or 30A fuse. In that case, you will need to buy a smaller fuse to match the one in the amp."
2,ok,"The product was shipped promptly. It seems adequate for a relatively low powered amp. I'm no expert, but it's been brought to my attention that the true gauge of the power/ground wires in this kit are far below 4 Gauge. This will probably prove problematic should I wish to further upgrade my sound system."
3,One Of The Better HELL HOUSES !!!,"www.braindamagefilms.comStarring: Shiela Kraics,Jessica Marie.a Jason Morris FilmDAUNTING,a definition: discouraging, inspiring fear; overwhelming, intimidatingly impressive.That's Brain Damage films' Hell House:BOS !The female leads are incredible beauties,Who dont mind gore( A film geeks wet dream).We have girl -on- girl,bath tub scene and blood as body glitter.This possesed house has all kind of nooks & crannies to suck you into Hell.The demon make-up is only out done by the dismembering and pure ""Balls Out"" violence !"
1,Same old coverage,"I was sorely disappointed in this book. I went by other reader's recommendations and I'm at a loss as to why it's got a 5-star rating. I was, and still am, looking for a source that will get past the theory & history and describe how to complete the process: What do you do after you've baselined & have to produce a build?"
5,"A definite ""Start-here-first"" type of book on SCM.","This is definitely a ""Start -here -first"" type of book on a complex subject. The author provides a comprehensive yet easy to understand explanation of SCM and its importance in the software development life cycle. The phases and fundamental areas of SCM are covered and as added bonus, the author provides an extensive assessment of current tools available on the market to facilitate the implementation of SCM activities. This book serves well as a practitioner's guide for anyone embarking on a first effort to institute a SCM program in his or her software development environment."
3,Wish it had more power,"Knowing what I know now I would not buy this saw again.My sawdust manufacturing facility is in the cellar and I never build anything that requires a full sheet of plywood. To save on the hassle of power cords I bought this saw to rip plywood as needed into a manageable transporting size. I find this saw to be way underpowered, the blade speed seems extremely slow. I find it very difficult to cut a strait line even when using a guide.Update 12/12/09Still feel that it's under power and therefore of limited use; but have put it to use multiple times when I needed to just cut a few 2x4's down to size and did it's job so I've upgraded it to 3 stars. You can't be in a hurry with this saw, you need to let cut at it's pace."
3,Average,"Battery life is poor. That's no different than any other cordless circular saw out there. I wouldn't buy it again if I had the choice. But since I have it, it does come in handy for small projects when I need something mobile."
4,One Reason to Purchase,"""Falling at Your Feet"" is the most powerful song in years, the heart of U2's music and success."
3,Few good songs with too much filler,"There's only 5 new good full length songs to listen to. Otherwise there's three versions of Satellite of Love and Spanish anarchy in USA which sounds like punk rock. The rest sounds like new age music similar to that found on Passengers. Still a must buy for U2 fans but just be warned, I didn't think it's all it was cracked up to be. 1 question: When are we going to see a new U2 song on the radio? Can Ground Beneath Her Feet do it?"
3,Worth buying for the U2/Bono Songs,"This album is somewhat disappointing. ""Ground Beneath her Feet"" is by far the best track. Also the Bono and Daniel Lanois song, ""Falling at your Feet"" is really good, the best non U2 song on the soundtrack. ""Stateless"" grows on you after listening to it for a while, it's also a good song as well as ""First Time"" from Zooropa.The spanish version of ""Anarchy"" is absolutely horrible. The rest of the album is muscic to fall asleep to."
4,what's this spanish punk-song here for?,"If you're looking for a good set of songs to spend a romantic dinner with well-known result then just go and buy this CD, but before you put it into your cd-player first scratch it (the cd, not the player) so it couldn't be played to the end. I don't know what this Sex Pistols' cover-song does on this soundtrack but it has a tragic infuence on the ""atmosphere"". Tito should better stay with his Tarantulas..."
3,wiring book,I bought this for my husband and it's good that it was cheap bc it's written for a 7th grader. Not for a person w/basic knowledge.
2,Does not work well for my toddler,"It is a nice swing for an infant, maybe 4 months to a year old. My daughter is 21 months old now and can not use it anymore. The padding is so thick in the front that when she sits in it the front padding compresses her stomach. There is nothing on the swing that holds it open so the heavier they get, the more they get squished. That front pad is square and projects inward and that is what is pushing on her tummy. She cries because she wants to get in the swing but then cries when she is it because it is hurting her. lt is also hard to get her in and out of with the parachute above. I am now on line looking for a new swing. It is a shame because this swing is so expensive."
3,Lots of Blood,"Although this was not one of his better movies, I like Christopher Lambert, and there was a lot of action."
2,Canon D661,"Ipurchased this copier March 2003, and have benn frustrated by the paper jamming consistently in the machine. I have been using Xerox 20 Lb paper and cannot print more than 50 copies without the machine jamming.I would not suggest this product for anyone that wanrs a reliable copier. It is extremelely frustating to keep puuling out the jammed pages and restart again.I print only 200 to 300 copies a month. The white pages I use are Georgia-Pacific Multi System Paper."
3,fits my custom made armchair,It doesn't fit that well in my custom made armchair but it's the best I could find to use as a cover. I wouldn't recommend it for chairs with thin arms.
4,"Great blender, but LOUD","I've been using this blender for months to make smoothies every morning, and sometimes even several times a day. It works great, crushing up ice and frozen fruit easily (though sometimes if the mixture is a little thick it has some trouble). My only issue with it is the noise. I know several reviewers have mentioned it already, but it's really bad. I rarely ever turn it to the high setting as it doesn't really need it--but it's mainly because on high, it'll just about blast out your eardrums. I like it and will keep it until it falls apart, then I'm shopping for something quieter."
3,Great for smoothies and frozen drinks,"Before this blender, we had a Krups Combi, and whenever we tried to use it for smoothies or frozen drinks we'd have to stop and use a spoon to stir things up before blending again. Not with this blender! The Oster makes awesome smoothies and frozen drinks. I've never had such a smooth frozen margarita. The only drawback to this blender is that it is LOUD, but it is so fast and makes such great, smooth drinks that it's an easy trade-off.Update: About three weeks after I wrote this review, I have had to downgrade the blender because it broke after only 8 months of use. I was making bread crumbs out of stale bread (which I had done previously with this blender with great success). However, this time the drive shaft coupling on the base snapped in two."
3,NOISY!,"I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS THIS BLENDER HAS BEEN GETTING. NO ONE MENTIONED THE HUGE AMOUNT OF NOISE WHEN OPERATING, I FEEL IT SHOULD COME WITH EAR PLUGS. ALSO THE LID DOESN'T SEAL PROPERLY AND ALMOST EVERYTIME I USE IT, SOME SPLASHES OUT. SURE, FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID I HAVE TO SAY IT MIXES FINE AND WITH THE MONEY I SAVED I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE ANOTHER MODEL!"
1,Worthless - Steer Clear of this one,"Photo display quality is poor.No built in memory.No supporting documentation.Cheap & Poor construction quality.For the money, you can spend 30-45 extra on another brand and receive memory and better video quality.PS - If I could give a Zero Star I would."
4,Love the style of these-beats all the rest-looks like Three Mile Island.,"I love the style of these - reminds me of evacuating for Three Mile Island when I was just a young'en. Seriously, they do look nicer than those with a wire support for the candle. I bought two & I'm going to get a few more.FYI: For warming a larger quantity of butter or whatever, a very nice product (and rather expensive) is theAll-Clad Stainless Butter Warmer with Pour Spouts. It is just a smaller All-Clad saucepan than normally purchased, and it can be used to at low heat to warm small amounts of sauces and such on the range. Hey - I mean like an electric or gas range, or even an induction cooktop, but not over a campfire on the prairie, silly!!! A less expensive option that I haven't tried is theNorpro Stainless Steel Butter Melter, which has a similar rating to the All-Clad item here at Amazon."
3,Not so interesting,"If you are brand new rider and have never ridden any type of motorcycle before or have no concept of the basics in motorcycle operation then this book is for you, otherwise only a few sections are worth the money-"
4,Perfect Waffles Every Time,"While I found this product for nearly $10 less at a local big box store, I wanted to add my review. We had an older waffle maker of similar style/different brand which didn't seem to be heating well recently. I wanted a similar style and didn't want to pay a lot as we only use occasionally. The heat control is placed in a better location (our old iron had it on the lower front and it had a very small temperature range - a subsequent move broke a piece of the plastic knob off). We set the temperature at medium or a bit higher and each waffle came out perfectly (we waited a bit before putting the batter in for each subsequent waffle). Perfect for a small family but might not work for larger ones unless you make ahead and keep warm. For the price we are totally satisfied. My only complaint is that the cord is VERY short which while a likely safety issue is a bit of an annoyance."
2,Waffle Maker,Uneven baking. Burns the center. Not deep enough. We wanted a 2nd griddle since it takes a while to bake them off. Placed this side by side with a Proctor Selix and what a difference!! The PS turns out beautiful waffles. The Sunbeam turns out unevenly cooked junk. I am returning the Sunbeam junker and paying just a bit more for the way better PS unit.
1,A Sticky Mess,"My husband bought this for himself after he destroyed the one I gave him for Christmas a few years before. We didn't like the other one because it was hard to clean (batter got around rim and under waffle plate). This one seemed ideal since it has sort of a dripcatcher feature around the rim. Well, the thing doesn't tell you when the waffle is done like our old wafflemaker. And the waffle never seems to be done-- just sticks to the plates and never gets crispy. I'm sure we will be returning this thing."
1,Not the wafflemaker we wanted,We waited too long to try this out after it came. We would return it if it wasn't so late. It takes forever to warm up and forever to cook! Then the waffle is not hot! Not happy at all with it.
4,dewlat cordless lineup,"tools perform above expectation. recommend additional battery, or dual charger. nice feel when in use."
5,I feel that Marlene Fanta Shyer's book is delightfull.,I feel that Marlene Fanta Shyer is a wonderfull author. I hope she continues to write outstanding realistic books such as Welcome Home JellyBean. I recomened this book to anyone young or old.
5,Great for the Kids!!!,"This is a flashback in time. My daughter loves the creative characters, and whole comedy of it all. We love anything bill Cosby kid related."
2,Not a set,"The product description misleadingly advertises a 3-piece set, but as the title suggests, the price includes only the 3/8"" tenon cutter. The 1/4"" and 5/8"" sizes are not included."
3,mediocre movie,"did noty do anything for me. Not really an oh,wow movie. I would not recommend this movie to any one."
2,Let Down,"I did not find this film very scintillating considering it was ""unrated"" and ""uncut."" The nudity was only occasional, and was not worth the wait. I will admit the film had a story line exploring the moral and ethical considerations of being a professional prostitute, but that is not what I want from an unrated video. I will also admit we ended up watching the entire film (waiting for something to happen), so the overall presentation was not that bad."
5,Great!,Works just like the original product. I would definitely buy another one if needed. You cannot beat the price compared to the original.
3,not as the original but still good for its price,"for that price I bought two batteries.I used them for a month, everyday, during a vacation, from full charge until it was fully depleted.The batteries work fine but do not last as long as the original on a single charge (maybe lasted 50% to 66% compared to the original, it is hard to tell since I did videos and photos randomly, so I didn't do an accurate comparison), still its worth buying in that price (~$3)."
3,Good start but..,"I echo the review done by the first person. I think this was a good start by Bear Records but they missed the mark. Yes, these are all good recordings by Billy Vaughn but what he was famous for is not truly represented here.I wish Bear Records will release all of his Twin-saxophone recordings as a set. I and a lot of my friends have been wanting to buy his twin-saxophone recordings."
5,Far North is wonderful!,"Far North was an excellent book! It shows the spirit of true survival. I really enjoyed this book because it was exciting and was full of action. Also, it was so detailed that I could picture what was going on. The author of this story made it seem so real that I could feel the emotions of the characters and felt that I was actually there. One part that actually really got to me is when Johnny Raven died, I really felt as if I was there. Far North was a very well written story.In this paragraph I will be comparing Far North with another book. This book reminds me of several other stories that I have read about survival. It especially reminds me of the book Hatchet. The reason is because of the circumstances. In both stories a plane crashes and the characters have to find some way to survive. Both Hatchet and Far North are very well written books. They both include a lot of detail and I would definitely give both a five star rating. Those are my feelings on Far North."
5,Adam's opinion of Far North,Far North is real exciting book. I liked it because of all of the adventure and excitment. I enjoyed this book a lot I hope you will too.
5,Catholic study bibles,"I love these Catholic study bibles, and highly recommend them:Navarre N.T. Expanded Edition,Navarre Pentateuch,Ignatius Catholic Study Bible N.T.I hope all the books of the Navarre Bible become available on Kindle, too!"
3,Product good but scratched when came,The movie is good but when I got it the circle in the middle that holds the DVD was broken so the DVD was inside moving around and got scratched so half way through the movie I have to skip a chapter I never sent it back because my autistic 3 yr old is obsessed with this particular care bears movie and watches it like 5x a day more if I'd let him. So I could never pry it out of his memory to send it back or wait for a new one. Oh well
5,septic - rid-x,"I use rid-x all the time, but having it shipped to me, every month is a great off, and you can't beat the price."
4,Rid-X Is GOOD!,"yes, I told my daughter and sisters about this product. It also helps to keep the bathroom smelling clean. I'll keep my order going."
3,septic thank treatment,"I've been using RID-X for quite some time now, and for the most partI thought I was doing the right thing. Well I had my septic cleaned,and to my surprise I was told not to use RID-X but to put buttermilk in my septic, that RID-X was no good for the septic system.Which is it???????"
4,Rid-X,Rid-X is just as I knew it would. I have used it in the past. Very wonderful being shipped to my mailbox and cheaper than at the stores!
1,disappointed,"I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed my purchase since I never received it...I did get one if the three books by mail, but not the other 2...certainly not a boxed set..."
4,Gatlin Fan,"I ordered this specifically for one of the most beautiful, heart-rending songs ever written and performed exquisitely by Larry Gatlin and his brothers. The title is ""I've Done Enough Dyin' Today"". Anyone who's loved and lost will shed some tears to this song, but melodically and harmonically it moves you to tears also. I enjoy singing karaoke, and this CD provided a good accompaniment and added the harmonies supplied by the Gatlin brothers. It's not the best sounding musically, but very adequate.Pro Artist: Larry Gatlin"
3,Disappointing,If you're looking for Crowbar's classical Doom sound look somewhere else. I'm long time Crowbar fan and this album really let me down. It's a far cry from the sound that made them who they are. I gave it a 3 because it's a decent rock/metal album.
5,Seat Covers,"I installed matching front and rear seat covers. Installation was very simple, can be done by one person. I have a boxer who rides with me on them all the time. They are durable and look great! Very pleased with how they really clean up the interior."
5,awesome hybrid of Model and toy,"wow.. i could go on and on about this.. i am a Gundam Fanboy, BUT i am very picky about my toys.. this.. was awesome, i bought with thinking that it might be cool to have, and boy was i surprised pleasantly, this Model is tough as they come, as possible as anything, AND it fits everything it comes with great, a problem with some Gundam toys is that they have a hard time holding the weapons they came with securely, not the case here.. solid as a rock, if some joints are a little loose, a thin coat of paint on the joints tightens them up nicely.The Zaku stands nicely in all its glory as it comes with many weapons not seen will the later shows of Gundam, the command fin on the secondary head may be bent a bit, but that's always re bendable, (love the plastic this is made from) its a great item and i have nothing to complain about. love it!A great match to Chars Zaku for some back up,"
5,Great software!,"For a change, an easy to use software that does EXACTLY what I need it to do. Further, it does it almost instantaneously. What a software! What a price!"
1,Incredible junk!,"Don't buy this. It will come apart the first time a little effort is required, such as sliding it under dough. The blade is only inserted into the handle less than 1/2"" and glued with something that doesn't even stick to the blade. Junk!"
4,A great weekend read,"In this sequal to ""The Maiden and the Warrior,"" there are several returning characters: Lucien, Alayna, and (now the hero) Agravar. Agravar saves Lady Rosamund from what he believes are kidnappers. She is in route to her betrothed, Robert, a man she has never met, but already knows she won't be able to marry him. Her step father has raised her to believe she is weak mentally, morally, and physically. She believes he killed her mother as well as being a cruel and arrogant man. The story follows Rosamund's realization that all men aren't cruel and she isn't weak. In the process she falls in love with Agravar, though she ends up married to Robert through trickery and threats. The story goes on from there. I enjoyed this light read, only wishing at times that there was more depth and development within the story. I've enjoyed all of Ms Navin's book and this one was no exception!"
1,Power cord shorted to the case,"After waiting for two weeks for this thing to show up. I plugged it in to test it out, and the power cord shorted to the case, creating an open in the cord. I called the number to the place on the warranty cord. What a bunch of yahoo's they put you on hold, and have that typical New York (they are from Brooklyn) low class attitude. I imagine they will try everything under the sun to get out of giving my money back. The power cord is undersized (too small a gauge), and not insulated enough for the current that this thing is going to swallow up. Beware of the arcy, sparky."
4,"Very cute movie, but not for children, definitely teens and up.","I've read four of the books and was watching TV when I saw the commercial for the movie (there are 10 books in total! so I'm way behind), but I might be wrong) I thought it was a series at first, until it came on teen nick and I watched it.Other than Georgia not having big nunga nungas, the movie was very similar to the books. I adored Georgia and her nutty friends ans they struggled to find their perfect sex god. I plan on getting the movie on DVD later in the year."
3,CUTE,The only words to describe this movie is cute and funny and entertaining for a lighthearted romantic comedy. I would recommend this for teens and young adults. The british vocabulary was fun to listen to.
4,"Fun, for teenagers -- or those with teenagers! Would recommend.","Saw the version released to the airlines (twice, actually, on a long international flight). Definitely enjoyed. Not trying to become a professional reviewer here, but the film is more than silly mind-candy for the targeted teen market. Touches on teen angst with appropriate humor and story development. Would definitely recommend."
3,"Mazer is a favorite of mine, but I was disappointed","I've been a fan of Mazer for probably 20 years now. Her ability to describe awkward, in-ward thinking teen girls is unmatched. Her descriptions of families and their dysfunctions, imperfections, and struggles is always enjoyable to read. This book left me disappointed, however. The whole thing is laid out like a journal, a collection of poems and letters and random thoughts. It never seems to GO anywhere, though. The main character's father gets laid off, her family falls on hard times, they have to move into a city apartment, her dad walks out, she changes schools, she learns what it's like to go from having everything to having very little... and that's it. There's no climax, there's no direction. It's a plesant, amusing, touching read, but it just never goes anywhere. It's like the build-up to a good book that gets cut off prematurely. For the best of Mazer's novels, I would recommend ""After The Rain"", ""Silver"", and ""When We First Met""."
5,As Heard on KYNG!,"I heard ""Call Me"" on KYNG in Dallas - now I can't stop singing the song in my head. Once you hear it for the first time, you'll be singing it, to. Billy Lee Davis truly takes the elements of classic country and merges them with the catchy melody and spirit of today's hottest music."
4,Quite Realistic,"Although this is by far not one of the best movies I have ever seen, I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, the dialogue could have been a lot better, but the thought behind it hit close to home. This movie is all about a meddling mother, which many of us can relate to. While two of her daughters are married, she is determined that her single daughter needs a man in her life, so she tries to set her up - by submitting an internet personal ad. I found the movie to be really cute. Although I have seen Diane Keaton to be better in other movies, I really liked Mandy Moore, Lauren Graham, and Piper Perabu as sisters. This was not as bad as I had thought it might be, based on other reviews I read. It's a true chick flick, but I'd watch it again!"
4,Funny movie,I really didn't expect to really care for this movie. It had some really funny scenes. Will probably buy it.
1,Watch Your Toilet Flush For A Better Time!,"Do you have negative stars?I thought ""Oscar"" & ""For The Love Of The Game"" we're the two worst movies I've ever seen but after viewing ""Because I Said So"" I have to mention this film as well when talking about the art of gaging!This movie sucks BIG-TIME!!!Put a few bucks in the toilet and watch them flush for a better time!"
5,More than I expected.,Eckart explains things in a very practical and applicable way. I highly recommend the book or the book on CD.
1,Disappointed,The #1 CD was a turn off and disappointment because the author constantly jokes about nonsense. I waited and waited to hear his view regarding what he had to say about living a life of inner peace. By the time the tape was over I got nothing out of it. I can't believe what the hype is about Tolle. It was a turn off to consider listening to #2 CD but I listend. I've been a spiritual metaphysical researcher and investigator for over 35 years. And having heard of Tolle's personal past experiences and issues was why I wanted to hear his input. But I was left with no significant point regarding how he recc.living life with inner peace.
1,Mold,I sent this item as a wedding gift. I was horribly embarrassed when I found out the bamboo spoon and chopsticks were covered in mold. I wasn't pleased with the way it was handled.
4,worth the price ($35),"Not a bad wok, and it fit me as a college kid. Sure enough, after a week the non-stick coating bubbled up and looks nasty, but it's all aesthetics. The temperature dial is handy, but it really only has two internal settings ('off' and 'fry'). If you use it to steam, it switches on - boils - then switches off when it reaches the temperature. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.It's nothing fancy, but it does a good job."
2,Great seller; wrong title,"Unfortunately, I was sent the wrong book. The seller was very gracious but did not have the correct title. I would do business with him again because of how he handled his error....and I will continue searching for the book I had hoped to receive!"
4,Great Western CD,Has alot of great songs but as with most CDs some you could do without but knowing this I would still buy it for the songs it has
2,What?????,this book is a waste of money it expects you too know c++ already what is up with that!it says teach yourself and it says its for beginners this bokk is crap dont buy it it sucks!
3,What's the audience?,"As far as I can tell, this book is for the beginner. It teaches game programming using C++ and the Win32 API. However, you need a lot of C++ experience before you start this book, so read up. This book also moves at an odd pace. By chapter 3, you're designing a game engine, but then you spend almost the entire book learning to draw sprites and animate them, with a few breaks for input and sound. This book does manage to make acomplishments in some areas where other books fail. You actually create more than one game, whereas other books simply throw a lot of demos at you and culminate in a game. Some topics that I haven't seen anywhere else yet are also covered here, like basic AI, keeping hi-scores, etc. Summary: good if you have a knowledge of DOS C++ and want to get into game programming with the Win32 API, but you may just want to skip this book all together and go straight for DirectX."
1,False and faulty information,"This book clearly states in several places that the accompanied listings (both in the book and on the cd) will compile with Dev-C++, Microsoft Visual C++, Borland 6.0, and the accompaning software. However all 4 of these programs DO NOT work and produce the same error messages when compiling. While it is good for the basics of what games are, and how they work, the code is faulty and makes it impossible to compile your own programs. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WANT EXACT INFORMATION."
5,Winter Cowhide Leather Mittens,With all the weather problems these mittens keep your hands warm while outside using a snow plow and shovel.......Mr. B
5,Deep & Simple,"Too often we may read quick-fix books and feel so excited, ready to try this or that, and then wait, hoping to get out of whatever rat-holes we find ourselves in, whether it be mental or physical imprisonment. It's as if we watch a blank screen and expect results. This is not what Deep & Simple is about. Bo never lets us forget tht there are mountains to climb, tough, rugged mountains that include every possible human situation. We can begin the climb by becoming connected to a spiritual path that will lead to our being awakened and fully alive.In a deep, simple, and clear voice, Bo reminds us all that no matter where we are as human beings, whether in suburbia or on death row, there is a goodness inherent in the human spirit. We all matter, we all count, and we are all able to make a difference.--- excerpt from Foreword by Jarvis Jay Masters"
4,Very Good Read,"I have been researching and reading about the Tombstone, AZ affair between the Earps, Doc Holliday, and the ""Cowboys"" for years. This book is an excellent means by which to understand the man who was Doc Holliday, why and how he acted as he did, and what brought him to Tombstone. His relationships, quirks, and final days are well described within the covers of this book. I highly recommend it to all who are curious."
5,Doc Holliday; the life and legend,"I did not read this one, but sent it to our friends in detention. They passed it around and it has been read many times, enjoyed many times and re-read time and again. Thank you."
3,It's an okay read.,"Like most people interested in western history, I wanted to know what the real story was to Doc Holliday and this book somewhat delivered that..painfully.This book tells the story of Doc Holliday pretty well. But unfortunately much of it is speculation. The truth is that there is and always will be mysteries to Doc Holliday. The evidence has either been destroyed or lost (as previously stated).It seems that the author was more focused on the history surrounding Doc Holliday than Doc Holliday himself. Reading it was also a bit of a chore too. I remember reading several segments in the book where it mentions Holliday one time over 5 or 6 pages of ""back story"" which I interpreted as ""filler"" so the book can seem better researched.Overall, I don't think I would buy it again, at most I would check it out at a library if I was doing research."
2,Not good for crushing ice for smoothies,"We have owned this blender for about 6 years and while we love its sturdy feel and clean design, the rubber coupler that allows the blade/blender to function started to deteriorate over time. I looked to find a replacement part and appliance.net has some recommendations and some ""horror"" stories as well. It seems like a flaw in the engineering. Bummer."
2,Disappointing for the brand name,"I thought when I bought this blender about 5 years ago, that being a Kitchen Aid, it would be a 1st class product. Well, in 5 years not much has changed with this product (I have checked it out at the stores). The main problem is that the blade is so DULL. If you reach in and touch it, you can see that it is thick but not at all sharp. This blender always leaves chunks of ice - you cannot make a decent margarita with this machine. The motor is plenty strong. If there was a way to put in a sharper blade, it may make all the difference."
1,Expensive Blender = Great Paper Weight,"Wow, we were excited when we bought this expensive blender.It worked amazing... for about 2 weeks. Over the course of 1 year we used it a total of 20 times, and each time the blender's performance declined. Right now it's basically on life support, and I'm 2 minutes from pulling the plug. I hate it, and I want it to die.Today, I wanted to make a smoothie, and the blender started making sounds like it had pneumonia. I glanced at the words ""ice crusher"" on the machine, and remembered the 4 huge chunks of ice leftover in the blender from my last shake-making fest. It should be labeled ""ice slapper.""But, this review has come across as too negative. On the positive side, KitchenAid's marketing team must be phenomenal because they convinced me to pay $100 for a worthless piece of crap.Does anybody have KitchenAid's marketing team's email address? Because I'd like to have them work for my business. I'm sure they could make me a lot of money selling the crap I make."
1,great blender - till it broke after 1.5 years,"I expect a high-end blender such as this to last for more than a year and a half. And, of course, Kitchen Aid's warranty is for one year! Argh."
4,Hours of entertainment,"Purchased this for my great nephew with learning disabilities. He loves baseball and since the regular season is over, I wanted to get him games to watch through the off season. He was so excited when he opened it and realized he had hours and hours of baseball to watch. Of course I selected the KC world series because I'm a fan of the Royals!"
4,Power supply Works,Use the power supply for marine grade am/fm/cd receiver w/attached speakers which I keep in an outside enclosed box with a hinged door in my patio area (the enclosure is water-tight) The supply works fine and does exactly what its suppose to do. I just wish it would last longer...this is the second power unit procured in 4 years for same purpose.
5,WOW,"I bought the power supply for my V-DAC II based totally on the other reviews and am glad I did.It took just a couple of minutes to hook up and I immediately heard a difference. Not a minor difference... it was in my face with wider sound stage and much deeper bass.I also want to comment on how pleased I am that Pyramid priced this product so reasonably. I have a couple thousand dollars wrapped up into my headphones rig and, up until ten minutes ago, was a little disappointed with the overall performance. I even thought that there was something wrong with my ears because all the other headphone, amp and DAC reviewers raved. This little power supply has made all the difference. Thanks Pyramid!!!It's been said by other reviewers but I need to repeat... the positive side of the V-DAC's cord is the one with the long rectangles. The negative side has the words.Amazon recommends that you buy a separated cord but it is totally unnecessary if you just snip the cord that came with the V-DAC."
1,so sad...,"I really wanted to believe this testing system worked but I had misgivings because I always seemed to get the answers I wanted. When I finished this book, I realized that was true. Dr. Hawkins has created and calibrated his truth. If he were liberal, he would have calibrated a liberal truth. I am an independent when I vote, sometimes I go left, then right, or middle of the road. However, it was clear to me that this book was mostly false. If you are conservative you will love this book, if you are liberal, you'll hate it. If you are intelligent, you won't even read it."
3,Not what I expected,I was told that an 800 grit Japanese water stone would be a good stone to finish your everday knives on. When I first started using it it did a wonderful job of honing my knives to a beautifully polished edge. However over time the grit on the stone started to get rougher and rougher. I was told this was either due to a factory defect in the stone or that the knives I was sharpening were to hard for the stone. The latter I find difficult to believe considering that all my knives have a very low carbon level. Maybe this stone will work for you.
1,A Very Poor Job,"This is a worthwhile subject, but the author does an extremely poor job. Her appeal is emotional, and she does not offer a coherent, FACTUAL refutation of Holocaust deniers' claims. In fact, some of their assertions that she chooses to ""refute"" are likely to be correct, if misused. Unfortunately, this is a very sloppy piece of work."
5,Just love these panties,I just love the way these panties fit and feel..and the lace insert is such a feminine touch ...they have become the only panties I wear lately.
4,T.D.H.,"Got the Dewalt battery in a timely manner, I've had the battery about a month and so far I'm very pleased. The XRP batteries seem much more powerful and they hold their charges longer."
4,Works great,Works as advertised as a replacement battery. It charged without a problem and powers my DeWalt drill as well as the original.
4,It works,I bought a couple to replace older ones I had. This battery is expensive for what it is. I've had no problems with them.
2,DeWalt Batteries,"Are the Dewalt batteries: DW9072 and DW9071 the same???If not, what are the differences???Thank you,Andy Wyatt"
2,Dissapointed,This product states it will play on Windows XP but it would not load onto our computer. After many e-mails I am having to send it back (additional cost to me) and it has taken longer then necessary to get to this point. I'm not sure why we are having problems since the product came looking to be in very good condition. Hoping to resolve this issue. I also have bought Trine and Fate and had no problems with those.p.s. I had to rate this product in order to leave a review but we have NOT been able to play it so the star value isn't accurate.
5,everyone who loves their pets should read this,excellent book. Every pet owner who cares about their pets should read this book and inform themselves.
2,Hates fat people,"Covert Bailey has some good ideas. I have read a few of his books (I bought the first one over 20 years ago), and I have to say that I am often bothered by how much he seems to despise fat people. It is kind of a turn off, and I realized that his attitude is just too negative."
1,Very Unhappy,"I've had this shredder in my office for a little over 2 years and it's way overdue for a replacement. There is a gap inbetween the collection bin and the holder it is in, so shreddings collect behind the bin until it pushes the bin out. Jamming is a problem and we don't feel comfortable feeding more than 3-4 sheets in at a time. When we first purchased this unit (a very long time ago), it was approved for CDs, now it apparently is not. Also this machine has starting making this loud grinding noise that almost hurts my ears when shredding papers.We are purchasing the C-420C and hope that it will be a better preformer. I guess you get what you pay for!"
5,Celtic and Samba---absolutely amazing!,"I was in Austin, TX when this CD premiered on the radio. Poor announcer couldn't get it off the turntable, folks kept calling in to hear more! This is pipes and drums with a kick of Latin rhythm that will literally rock the house.If you like the Chieftains and their versatile style, you'll love this CD. If you like samba, you'll probably love it, too. If you like DIFFERENT--you have got to try this out!"
1,Flasher is to big for stanard socket.,"i have not been able to see it work yet, as the flasher is too thick and the light is not able to screw on i have tried it on several light socket including the par-cans i bought it for and it wont work."
1,subset of the DC-022 for almost the same price,"It's great to have 2 chargers that handle multiple voltages - but for a few bucks more you get an extension cord, 3 outlets with gfci, and a 38W light that is AC or DC powered, and those same 2 chargers, except they have hold down brackets to keep the batteries in place. Check out the DC-022 light/charger/extension instead at this price point. It's real nice to pull a 38 watt light into your attic with no cord, or to have an ac powered light & charger - it does double duty."
3,Not a good fit for certain models,"Says that it fits the 9mm Sig Sauer SP2022, but really to too tight a fit. Not recommended for that model."
2,"Bad fit for Sig 2022, leaves trigger partially exposed","The manufacturer claims this will fit a Sig 2022. Technically, it does ""fit"" but is very tight on the sides. The real problem is it doesn't cover the trigger entirely! about 50% of the trigger (the actual trigger lever) is exposed from the sides. I did make sure to have it ""snapped-in"" all the way forward, still not covering trigger completely.Most Competition leagues would not allow this: considered to be unsafe if the trigger is not completely covered.(I tested with a Sig SP2022 in 9mm, the ""new"" style with picatinny rail on-front)"
2,"Exposes trigger for Springfield XD 4.5""","I'm surprised others liked this product for their Springfield XDs. My 4.5"" fit nice and snug, except the majority of the trigger was exposed! I'm sure I had it inserted all the way. It seems like a safety issue, and I don't like it.Other than that it seemed well-built and easy to draw while keeping the pistol secure. I just couldn't get over 3/4 of the trigger being exposed and I returned it. If you don't mind the exposed trigger then I guess it's good."
4,Beautiful but lacking,"This is a beautiful book! The illustrations are worth the price of the book. However, its text is quite lacking in many areas."
5,A Must for Any Masonic Library,"This brief work is exquisitely illustrated and written. It contains excellent reproductions of engravings, posters, paintings and more. It is learned without being pedantic. He asserts, in a balanced and well articulated argument based on examination of the ritual and its symbolism, that the origins of the craft are to be found in Renaissance neoplatonism."
1,Waste of Time,"Bad customer support. Difficult to use. Damaged my hard drive.Finaly was told to send it back, it's defective."
2,Suehiro D1069 Japanese Stone,I am use to the normal whetstone. I found this stone not as good. I couldn't get a real good edge with this stone. It may be due to the fact that I am use to the whetstone. It did better on my meat cleaver than my chef's knife and other less heavy blades. I would not buy this type of stone for honing my knifes again.
4,good stone,I recently purchased this stone for sharpening. It work good to a certain degree i still question it because the knife don't come out as sharp as i liked but it could also be my skills so as of right now it fair good for ratings. Also using the stone is a messy operation.
1,Goodman and Gilman (Kindle Edition),"The problem with the Kindle version of ""Goodman And Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th ed."" is that you cannot navigate the table of contents. When you scroll down to go to a specific chapter or section, it puts a box around the entire page and does not let you select anything. Since this a large book, scrolling through it page by page is not an option. Customer service states, ""I understand you are unable to navigate within your Kindle book's table of content by selecting certain sections. This option is not available for this title because this is an option made available by publishers who provide content to the Kindle store."" I contacted them again and hope to get a better solution or someone else to contact concerning this issue. As for now, save your money!"
1,A disappontment,"I was warned this wasn't worth the inexpensive price, and I should have listened. Hope I can get my money back now. Disfunctional and unresponsive customer service."
2,Bet you did not know. . .,"Xbox 360 ControllerBet you did not know that the xbox 360 controller w/usb connector works on the p.c. Also, most games are configured with the controller being the default game pad for p.c. Save time and money. Easy driver updates for vista from microsoft. Save a couple of bucks and calories- just do yourself a favor. Also the wireless controller works really well."
2,"Dunno about the analog stick yet, but...","The directional pad simply sucks. I've only had it for a day, and despite the overally comfort and setup ease of this controller, the directional pad is another one of those ""nearly impossible to just hold up without going diagonal as well"" pads. You push up, and 95% of the time you will either be going up+right or up+left, and ditto for all other directions, down, left or right.... its the most frustrating thing in the world, ever try playing a game like Silent Hill on one of these controllers? Its a nightmare (no pun intended)"
2,DO NOT BUY IT! BEWARE LEFT ANALOG!,This controller is good for games that dont require use of the left analog stick. This analog stick broke like in 3 days. Logitech made a fortune out of us that bought they're controller. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS CONTROLLER
2,LEMON,"Wow, I see a running theme here. I firt bought the controller a couple of months ago. After a couple of weeks the left analog controller went out. It wouldn't respond at all. I took it back and got a new controller thinking the one I had originally was just defective. A couple of weeks later it went bad too.The controller is great when it works. But the sad thing is that it doesn't work for very long. Worthless. I thought Logitech made good stuff too."
3,Would have been perfect if not for the Analog Sticks,"I played with this gamepad both on my PC and my PS3 (no set-up needed), however there is a single issue with the Analog Sticks that makes this gamepad virtually unusable for many games:The plastic ""borders"" or the analog d-pads are not circular, instead they are like squares with smoothed edges. Whenever you want to go left, the stick either drifts towards top or down, and same for the other directions. It is really frustrating, when you are effectively limited to the 4 diagonal directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), which means it is almost impossible to move the stick to a desired direction.I would give this product 5 stars if it wasn't for this crucial design mistake. I'm still amazed at how this product was produced with such a big design flaw. It should have had a circular border around the analog d-pads just like the ps3 or xbox controllers."
1,Callibration issues are not a joke,"Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!"
2,Mixed bag,"On the plus side: The controller is very comfortable, the button layout is familiar and versatile, and the analog control is very good... at first.On the down side: The directional pad tends to go diagonally if not pressed exactly right, and the analog sticks wear out very quickly, becoming jittery and losing chunks of their field of movement sporadically during use. Also, the profiler software kills the use of my other gamepad when it is booted up.All in all, this is what could be a flawless pad - except for a couple of flaws, one of them major.Logitech is apparently working on a version with more viable analog sticks, and these should be available by april 2004."
1,THIS IS THE WORST PAD EVER!!!!! dont get it!!!,I bought this pad and it only lasted about an hour!!! I tried calibrating it and it still didnt work. the only thing that broke was the analog sticks which is the most important part. whatever you do DONT BY THIS GAMEPAD because it will come back to haunt you and horrify you with its BAADDDNESS!!!(Instead of this controller I would recomend a microsoft pad)
2,2 stars because I like the design,Do not buy this pad. I had the same issue the other person wrote.. The left analog stick goes crazy after 15 minutes of playing. The Wingman Action pad also had this problem. Can anyone at Logitech fix this?? I'm definitely not buying the logitech pad the next ime.
2,Not another crappy D-pad I WOULD RATHER USE A KEYBOARD,Pc gamepads suck compared to the concole gamepads. I got this one because it looks like a playstation replica. I paid 20 dollars for this gamepad and it had unsatisfactory results.I played n64 games on my pc using this gamepad and let me tell you there is no point in having a D-pad because it just doesnt work. I thought maybe there something wrong with the emulator but actually it is the gamepads fault. As for action pc games such as GTA VICE CITY I still had problems with the D-pad. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE YOUR KEYBOARD.
4,good quality controller,"product is really good. i got it and plug it in and started playing. mines is a lil missed up but its my fualt, and i assure you the product is durible. sorry bout the price cause i got mines for $12 but i guess amazon is trying to rip ppl off"
4,Awesome little Game Pad,"This gamepad is pretty fantastic. Almost exactly what I was looking for, really. Using it on my MacBook and didn't have to bother with drivers, just plugged it in and configured my controls for whatever emulator I was using. I've experienced one issue with the joystick sensitivity. Trying to power slide in Mario Kart 64 proved a bit hit-or-miss, but I think it might change from game to game (dealing with ROMs at least).Nothing better than busting out Super Mario World for SNES like a G on a bus, train, or plane and making everyone around you jealous."
2,Good for the first week or so.,"After a few weeks of using this item, the left stick's x-axis was permanently stuck to the right, not physically, but it was reading an upright position to be going to the right. There was never any way to keep my character going straight and I am stuck to a keyboard until I buy a different one. I looked at reviews earlier today, I am not the only one having a joystick malfunction. Do not buy this, spend 5 extra dollars on the rumble pad, it doesn't have this problem."
1,F'N P.O.S,"If your going to waste your money on this F'n P.O.S. then buy some dynamite too, so when it pisses you off to no end you can blow it up and get a tiny bit of enjoyment out of it. Do not buy this item, even after downloading a bunch of stupid drivers from logitech and a program to sync the controls with the controller, I still can't move forward. Forward makes you run backward. I even took the stupid piece of junk apart to try to reverse the toggle stick. I think I'm just going to smash it to bits with a hammer, still debating though. Maybe if I spend another couple of hours and pray for a miracle I MIGHT be able to run forward when pushing forward and not backward."
3,Problematic but usable,After reading the poor reviews I decided not to buy this from amazon but instead found one used at a garage sale for 3$. I got my money's worth. The lower left joystick randomly thinks it is being shifted down. I had to configure the my emulator to ignore the down on that joystick and treat one of the buttons as the joy-down command. The d-pad has 8 directions so one has to get used to pressing it more carefully. Another one of the buttons makes a strange click when you press it the wrong way but works well. The rest of this controller works wonderfully. I played snes and n64 games on it comfortably. This controller has so many buttons that one can play any game on it even if a few parts of the controller are bad. It works. and for 3$ I am satisfied.
2,Same Problem - Analog Sticks Suck!,"Yes, I will have to chime in with the rest of the people. The analog stick (left on mine) is so jiggly and flaky that you can leave it sitting still in the Windows calibration screen and it will move all over the window by itself. Logitech of course, claims it's just worn out. Maybe, but I guess the other reviewers were right. Buyers beware!"
4,Nice,For the price it's a pretty decent controller. Simple yet gets the job done. The program that you can get so you can program the keys yourself is very nice as well.
3,works for some game not all,this works for my older games like startcraft but doesn't fully work for newer games like oblivion.
4,A Feelgood Chrissy Movie,"I enjoyed this movie, although fairly predictable in storyline. It follows a typical single girl meets single guy routine, but with some twists and turns along the way. I've always appreciated these kinds of movies where you know you can sit down and watch without worrying about whether the movie will be family friendly. My favorite aspect of this movie is the way the whole town comes together to enjoy Christmas and the holidays. A charming movie for the whole family.All She Wants for Christmas"
3,"Sweet storyline, not the best acting","I'm a sucker for Christmas movies in general. I will agree with the others here in that the acting was terrible, at least the main female character was played by a terrible actress (who is she? I don't recognize her from anything else), the rest of the cast did an OK job. Even so, I still enjoyed the sweet story line. And all and all, for a Christmas TV movie, it's not the worst I've seen."
3,"Excelente para los LCD, no para el iPod","Use este producto para limpiar el LCD de mi iMac G5, y vaya que funciona, me dejo la pantalla como nueva, lo unico que se me hizo extranio y que me hizo dudar, fue que en las indicaciones me sugerian hecharle el spray directamente en la pantalla, con dudas lo hice sin dejar que escurra el liquido y rapidamente lo puli con el panio.Lo que si me decepciono fueron los resultados con el iPod, ya que si lo dejo rechinando de limpio, pero no le quito ni un solo rasgunio, ni los mas leves.Para pantallas 5 estrellas, para iPods 2."
2,Clear explanations but a little long- winded,"As a student studying philosophy at Glasgow University i found this book well laid out and it gave clear explanations to the topics presented. However, i also found the particular explantions were very long which was simply not needed. The question section was also useful for tutorial work but not for studying because it did not have answers included. This was very unhelpful and it makes the section quite pointless becuase you do not know whether you are correct or not."
3,Whatever,"Well, i would sure concider buying one if they had a picture so i could see the thing. Oh well"
4,Solid overview of basic concepts,"This is a good introduction to basic math skills, but I don't think that it will be very useful for a high school student. Upon entering high school, a student should have mastered such topics as fractions, percents, and integers, and if he or she hasn't, then he or she is in trouble.The DVD consists of what seem to be simple PowerPoint slides. The voiceover is clear and spoken at a good pace. Each lesson lasts a few minutes, and ample time is provided to complete the given examples. Each lesson includes good definitions of key terms and ends with a quick review of the material that was covered. Overall, I think that this DVD would likely be more beneficial to an elementary school or middle school student who is looking for an overview to material that he or she has already been exposed to in school."
1,Don't even think of buying this product,"This is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen. I tried installing it in two ordinary, conventional computers running Windows XP and it DID NOT WORK! The help desk told me things like: ""Yeah, it's not supported on some motherboards"". What kind of answer is that? I spent HOURS on the phone with them trying all sorts of things.Berl"
1,A barely working product from not reputable manufacture,Don't buy this!!!!!This is a barely working product.The tech support is useless.The video capture quality is very low.You would not want to have video like this.The captured frames are also broken every now and then.
5,Good coverage,I was concerned about my Zune because every piece of equipment I own is prone to droppage. The ToughSkin has nice thick silicon corners that feel like they will allow the Zune to suffer through more than it's share of punishment. I was concerned about this case because reviews I had read detailed how much thicker it made the device but it really was a non-issue since the added thickness makes it fit nicely in my hand and any added bulk is offset by the belt clip (which I didn't even know came with it!) so it doesn't eat up pocket space. The screen protecter is a tough plastic and is nicer than the normal ones though it gets dust trapped between it and the screen very easily.Overall I am very happy with this case and the protection it offers my Zune.
5,Great Buy,This was a very good purchase and you would be pleased to buy it.The case is probably the best one I have ever seen. The piece that protects the screen is solid instead of the flexible ones they make so it protects the screen very well. Easy to put on and take off. I give it 2 thumbs up.
1,five starts for zune 30GB...DOES NOT FIT 80GB v2!!!!!,"I have never seen so many positive ratings- I am jealous, really wanted it to work - but it does not fit the new zune v2.....the thing slides around in it, the screen is now bigger, the protector doesn't cover it all...the main button does not hit the right key since it slides and it does not recognize the touch under the rubber. The new position for the locking switch is on top left, not center anymore.I hope they come out with new version....and side note, mine was 25$, why are some retailers asking $125...supply and demand??don't do that...SFplanet's website has them still for $26...but only get for v1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

2,I was surprised that the book had wrong tribal identification.,"I was surprised the book had wrong tribal identification for Les James.Les James is not a Southern Sierra Miwok, but a Chuchansi and Casson Yokut. Yokuts are not Miwoks.The same with some of the other people."
3,didne't work out good.,"The day I got this I was so happy. I plugged the usb into my computer and started using it. 6 days later it crashed my computer and my computer is vista. I pluged the usb into my laptop and it worked out fine. So when you get this joystick, Don't put it into a vista or it will crash you computer or brake it. Use it in a xp and it will work."
3,NO INSTRUCTIONS,"PURCHASED A LOGIECH ATTACK 3 JOYSTICK. IT WORKS, BUT IT DID NOT COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PROGRAM THE BUTTONS, SO IT IS DIFFCULT TO USE, AND CAN'T FIND ANY WHERE TO DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS ON WEB SITE."
3,seems fine,this joystick seems to work just fine...my bad for ordering a joystick that my computer will not even accept....dummy me
3,Good Joystick!,"This is a good joystick, i have the Attack 2 too, and the version 3 is more compact, strong and hard!"
1,Two to three weeks,"Lasted only 2-3 weeks before it started sending phantom button presses at the worst possible time. Worked fine up to then, so I suppose consider the price as being more like a rental fee that you have to pay over and over again when it stops working right."
1,Very Uneven Book - But Mainly A Failure,"This book is full of ""ups and down."" When the author is dealing with an action scene he is fairly interesting. However, all too often, the writer is bogged down in boring philosophy and constant references to a few old books and authors good though they may be. I wanted an interesting novel not a partial book review.Save yourself the bother of plodding through the boring bits to find the few good parts. There wasn't enough of the good to make it worth your time."
4,Excellent quality,"This item was well represented as displayed and the stone is substantially larger then the combination stones I have previously purchased, I expect to get a good many years of use with this stone."
5,One of the best nonfiction books I've read this year,"This is a real page-turner, and absolutely fascinating. The author tells the stories of five immigrants to the U.S. and New York City around 1900, but what's amazing is the power of the voices here, plus the photos. The focus is on young people, but my adult book group read this and loved it. Everyone has seen photos of the crowded Lower East Side, but this book makes you think of the individuals and their families who lived there."
2,So so,"I first saw a preview of this show a few years ago at Anime Weekend Atlanta. I was really looking forward to watching this. Sadly, like many other animes, the show is severely lacking thus far. I haven't read the manga but I know it's still being written. Perhaps that's the problem. The studio may be trying to get the series out to the media before there was any good source material so they just started making stuff up.There's too much filler episodes and not enough story/character development. It's too episodic. In fact, by Season 2, I've started watching it on fast forward!Mind you, the animation series I prefer include Full Metal Alchemist and Avatar the Last Airbender. So if you are not of similar interests, disregard this review and give it a try."
1,Avoid buying this Scanner !,I have spent hours and hours trying to get this scanner to work properly. But the software crashes permanently and scans of +10 pages systematically crash the PC. HORRIBLE.
5,Fun for everyone!!,"Spongebob is one of the best cartoons ever.It's funny and suitable for all ages.Here a low down on the episodes on this VHS:Jellyfishing-After Squidward recovers from a bicycle accident,Spongebob&Patrick; decide to give him ""the best day ever'by taking him(you guessed it)jellyfishing.Dying for Pie-For Employee Appreciation Day,Squidward gets Spongebob an exploding pie.Before he can take it away(after finding how destructive it is) Spongebob eats it...Wormy-Spongebob&Patrick; take care of Sandy's pet worm.The next day,they found out a ""monster"" ate him!!F.U.N-Sensing Plankton's loneliness,Spongebob decides to treat him to a day a fun,much to Mr.Krab's dismay.Club Spongebob-Squidward,Spongebob&Patrick; accidently get launched into the middle of nowhere.Their only hope is the Magic Conch shell.If you love Spongebob,you love this VHS!!"
2,it's cute,"I love the Mix Max player and this speaker is a nice match, ..... I've added a change to this review and if I could I would give it four stars. I just figured out to use the adapter with the mix max player and then the speaker works as it should and the unit sits very stable to make it easy to push the buttons. The lights flash and the speaker quality is better. I still think the cardboard speaker on the back of the unit is a poor design for children. I think it will get broken too easily.another update... have had the speaker 5 months now and use it 3-4 times a week and there's been no problem with that 'cardboard' speaker on the back. Still works great and my grandchild loves it."
3,Good Product- Overpriced shipping,Good product but the shipping cost was ridiculous...I should have just bought it at my local school house store.
2,Review if decent - practice questions are weird compared to OG,"I did not find the book very helpful.The practice questions are strange compared to OG. They are sometimes wrong, sometimes asked in a confusing way. I went through the OG, and never encountered those kind of questions.I would not recommend the book."
2,Pick up Modern Arnis Instead,"I got this video set for a VERY good price, so I thought I'd give them a look. I'm a practitioner of various martial arts including several Filipino Martial Arts, and was interested in checking out another person's view of Filipino Martial Arts. I was less than impressed to say the least. The techniques are past the beginner level and yet don't explain well the basics that would be needed to properly perform and understand them. While Mr. Melegrito appears to have a fair knowledge of the background of some styles and his teaching methods are decent, the information needs to be taught in a much different manner to properly educate those unfamiliar with the styles. If you're interested in learning Filipino Martial Arts, you'd be MUCH MUCH MUCH better off picking up Remy Presas's Modern Arnis books and videos. I"
3,"How do you rate a light bulb, really?","I bought 2 and placed in matching lamps. One has a deep, rich warmth. The other doesn't quiet match up. It's rather obvious, really. If you are buying just one bulb, it is nearly certain you will like it. If you are buying multiples for matching lamps, there is a good chance you will irked by the lack of congruity."
4,Hilarious and poignant,A hilarious read. Most contemporary novels don't spend too many years on my bookshelf but this one endures. Edward Allen is a talented wordsmith and I wish I could find more novels he has authored.
5,Great movie . . . .,". . . . for those curious about the workings of our mind, this movie based upon a true story, this is an informative look into how we can reach out to others in various ways."
4,sad and not .... enlightening,Good music through out. Dad got for these trying times.what he was so very much trying to get back. Well done
3,tastes sugar free...,I bought these as a gift for a diabetic....I ended up getting him something else after we tried them!
4,You better beware of those bad ole Christians!,"I mean it. They'll chop off your head if you disagree with them. Wait! That's not Christianity. That's some other religion.Well, they have a plan for taking over the world and focing everyone to become Christians. No, that's not it. That's another religion.Well, I'm sure they believe that if they die fighting to spread Christianity, they'll get seventy virgins. No. That's that other religion I can't think of the name of.But I'm sure if you don't convert to Christianity, you'll be forced to pay most of your income as a tax to the Christian church. No. I heard that somewhere else.I just can't think of the name of that other religion. Teacher said we weren't supposed to mention its name. It was okay to mention Christianity though, as long as we had something bad to say about it.I guess I'm just confused. But everybody knows that Christians are bad people and that Christianity is just about the worst thing that ever happened."
3,Expected more,"It many ways this is a rehash of the blogosphere and evening news. Its principle focus is on how American culture is diametrically opposed to Biblical values. I was looking for a book that was broader in scope than simply the pro-abortion and pro-homosexual agendas verses traditional Biblical values. Little in the book actually points to the criminalization of Christians in the same way we were criminalized in the Roman Empire.That is not to say that Christians are not marginalized, because in many ways, our viewpoints are denounced. Will the inherent tolerance of Christianity eventually see Christians persecuted in America? If those pushing the elimination of free speech because of hurt feelings get their way, we will.It's an okay book and does present the pitfalls of the highly vocal lobbies that are currently pushing unfettered amorality upon the American scene. It is that amorality and immorality that Christians will push back against."
2,Not the best comedy.,Not the best comedy of our time .I think Zoolander is a very stupid movie.The only reason I think it is a little funnyis because it is so stupid it is funny.It is very porley made and it just isn't the type of comedy I would acually like.If your in the mood for a comedy don't see this one.
2,Unbelievably Stupid,"I must say, this movie looked sooo incredibly funny! I was really excited about seeing it, and was really dissapointed with it. Few parts were laughable. Zoolander was nothing it had been said to be. Most movies are stupidly funny, and this one was just stupid. I rarely dislike movies, and yet I din't like it. If you still want to see it, wait until it's at Blockbuster. It wasn't worth (the money)."
2,Stupid!...a waste of $,"This movie was not that funny...just stupid. Two guys that are really dumb and not that humorous. Save $10 on this one and see something else, unless maybe your IQ is below 80."
1,ZOOLANDER IS A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"IF YOU ENJOY BEN STILLER MOVIES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FUNNY, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING ZOOLANDER.THERE ARE A FEW CHUCKLES, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. IT CAN'T TO HOLD A CANDLE TO HIS OTHER MOVIES"
2,could have been better,"Here we have mindless entertainment brought to us by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. It was in fact not as entertaining as I might have hoped. Although I found the tale of two competing male models who eventually join forces to be not quite as funny as it could be, the scenes of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) visiting his father and brother (played by Jon Voight and Vince Vaughn) seeking their acceptance but not getting it rather funny... later when Voight cries in acknowledgment, ""That's my son"" as Zoolander unleashes his new ""look"" is also amusing, but that is all I can say for this film: it is mildly amusing but nothing I could not have lived without."
3,"Excruciatingly Stupid Humor, yet strangely enjoyable","This movie was almost too painful to watch, like America's funniest home videos, when you know the kid is going to knock a home run straight into his father's jimmy sack, it hurts, you know it does, yet still you watch. This movie is a straight kick in the mental croch, yet it is almost impossible to turn away from it and watch something more intellectual like Airplane! or a rerun of Jerry Springer, the black homosexual midget clans man or something. Is my point clear enough yet? The movie is a must watch if you are into stupid humor and wasting your time, watch it on a rainy day when you don't want to go outside and smell the sewage in Jersey. Though I might add, that the entire southern section of California might not want to view this title, you may take it as a serious movie."
4,Funny in a stupid way,"I really, really didn't want to see this movie. I don't think Ben Stiller is that funny, and I didn't think the concept was all that great. But my wife talked me into it, and I'm glad she did. All things considered, this movie was very entertaining.Ben Stiller puts on a great performance as Derek Zoolander, and does it well. He's stupid, but not TOO stupid. Throw in Owen Wilson (quickly becoming the king of braindead roles) and you have quite the duo. With a part for Ben's dad and also a role for Will Farrell as the bad guy, you have an good cast that works very well together.Of course, you shouldn't think this movie is going to have a plot, or even a direction of any kind. Brace yourself for stupid jokes, and corny developments. But, if this is what you've come to expect in a comedy, you'll definitely not want to miss this one. I'm glad I didn't."
1,Zoolander is the worst in a long time,"I bought the movie based on Stillers other work - what a joke! That was the worst twenty bucks I have spent in several years. If you rent or buy this movie, make sure you have enough booze to get lit prior to putting it on..."
1,Zoolander,I was [ticked] that we rented this trash. My wife and I did not laugh once during the part of the movie we managed to watch before turning it off. I cannot honestly believe that those who were involved with the making of this movie laughed even once when they watched the finished product....
1,Weak premise never really develops,Let me start by saying I think Ben Stiller is hilarious but this movie has the depth of a Saturday Night Live skit. Once you get the joke that models are self-absorbed airheads there's not much left. The evil fashion empire that uses assassination to maintain its access to a cheap labor pool is a premise with some room but it never really goes anywhere. There's hardly any setup and no follow-through to make us care; without that foundation the jokes and slapstick just come off as obvious and hollow. Definitely give this one a pass.
2,horsemonkey,"This film had its moments, but when it was over both my girlfriend and I thought it stunk to high hell. There are a few laughs, but Ben Stiller is more annoying than he's ever been, and the film is simply overkill. The plot is also a tad confusing--certainly not profound though. If you are in a silly mood, go ahead and watch it. If you are not in the mood for b.s., caution: you may destroy your television."
3,If you like seeing comedies that are stupid you have to see,"This movie is one of the stupidest movies i've ever seen. Although it was pretty funny. It had a great cast of new actors that I think will have a great career. the point of this movie is a male supermodel Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller)is outdone by a new model Hansel (Owen Wilson). Zoolander gets brainwashed by a evil fasion designer (Will Ferell) to kill the ambassador of Malasia. Only when he hears the song ""Relax"" he pays no attention to anything but killing the ambassador. In the end Hansil and Zoolander team up and outdo their enemies. It was'nt the stupidest movie i've ever seen but I can't wait to get it when it comes out on DVD."
3,"""An old Book.""","Got here in a timely fashion. It was a fair price. Not super clean and fresh, but not too musty dusty either. I'm happy."
5,Ancient History Buffs Delight,"This 1976 legal history by Hans Julius Wolff remains one of the premier works regarding the development of ancient Roman law. It begins by laying out a helpful historical distribution of power existing in the Roman Empire's leadership. It makes the book accessible for the curious layperson as well as the academic.It places Roman law in its historical context in western civilization. From the original Twelve Tables, through Justinian's Code, to the author's reflection on its modern ramifications, it is a great read for ancient history buffs. It also provides a very rewarding challenge for the s layperson who is able stick with it."
2,Not enough,This unit was not enough amperage for what i was needing. Was not the units fault though. So i can't really tell you much about it
2,Couldn't get past the basic premise.,"I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the basic premise -- she gets a job at a halfway house without any credentials or training, and the boss immediately leaves her to handle the house's residents on her own? She's expected to enforce rules, mete out punishments, and later, *counsel* these women, with no training or social work background? And with a history of narcolepsy? Come on, now."
4,Hawkeye,"Typical Bear Family product - well mastered, great liner notes & photos. Combined with the great talents of the subject this is well worth the money."
5,I couldn't be happier..,"I absolutely LOVE this mixer-no regrets with purchase, simple easy to use and I've also biught attachments which I enjoy! i would recommend this to anyone! Also, the pink color is adorable and I get so many compliments on it!"
1,Shoddy,"My wife and I received this mixer as a Christmas gift in 2004. Not 5 years later, it no longer works. First the gears would spin but not the mixer. Then it would not turn on. This isn't a lifetime item like you might think. This isn't an isolated incident either. There have been many consumer complaints over Kitchen Aid's decision to use cheap plastic gears and other poorly made internal parts. The outside is definitely sturdy and attractive but the insides are result of KitchenAide cutting corners to save a few dollars. What a waste!Don't listen to the short time owners. Yes, it makes great cookie dough, for maybe 4 or 5 years. After that, it's very large door stop."
4,"Great Unit, poor sound","I'm really enjoying this unit. The only drawback is the sound from the built-in speakers is so poor I can only bear to listen to it using headphones. This isn't a problem since I have only watched DVD's on it by myself so far, but I'd have to get a 2nd pair of headphones and a splitter if I wanted to watch DVD's with someone else. I don't fully understand the purpose of a remote with a unit that has a screen so small that you have to be in arm's reach of it anyway. That is not a complaint, I'm just puzzled. Overall , the unit seems to be of good quality and I'd recommend it."
2,"Excellent Topic, Very Poor Execution",I am a fan of John Jakes. The North and South series are some of the very best novels I've read. I was very disappointed in On Secret Service and could not get past page 100. The concept of the novel is excellent but the plot surrounding the historical facts is very thin. The characters themselves lack any depth and provoked no emotional response from me as the reader. The story simply did not intrigue me enough to finish it.
1,Expiration date: 3-6 months,"Had the same ""orange light... modem reboots"" issue described by others here. Since they know about this issue (although they won't openly acknowledge it) tech support will be glad to ship you another for $15. (Avoid their wireless USB adaptors too... bluescreen issues with WinXP)."
1,Do not buy this product.,I was too taken in by the cheap price. My modem worked for 2 weeks before burning out. I now bought a motorola and is working fine.BUYER BEWARE ON THIS MODEM!!!!
5,The ONE tape that my boyfriend doesn't mind watching!,"This is one program we plan to purchase in DVD because is is the only one that my boyfriend can tolerate! I don't mind watching Thomas, Barney and Blue's Clues, but the I Love Toy Trains is one that keeps our son's attention AND makes his dad happy! Now I have to buy a copy since we need to return the one we have to the library!"
4,Real Life Adventure,"I bought this book because a friend and I intend to ride from North to South America in 2018 when all our kids have grown old enough not to miss us. I really hope that we don't have to live through what Glen did but who knows what the continent will be like in 10 years? This is a brilliantly written book with lots of good information and tips for travel. The section on Columbia is well done and doesn't overdominate the story. I wonder from Ted Simon's comments in 'Dreaming of Jupiter' after meeting Glen following his ordeal, if Glen has downplayed his emotional state a little. It must have been a totally awful experince and one I doubt I could have survived. It just goes to show that it helps to be strong when attempting a journey like this but like so many things at the end of the day its all about mental toughness. I take my hat off to Glen and he has inspired me yet again to start my own adventure."
2,Okay,"For some reason I don't believe this book. The whole book seems like some kind of hoax - a planned event. There are several wonderful places a man going through a mid-life crisis can explore on a motorcycle to find himself; Glen seems begging for all of these horrible things to happen to him. The author is a bit full of himself and his uncultured descriptions of the places and faces he encounters are a complete bore. I admit that when I purchased this book I was searching for the innocent escape I reaped by reading ""Jupiter's Travels"" by Ted Simon, not an ego charged, made for t.v. action adventure."
3,"several minutes to load, done in 3 seconds","Got two of these for my sons. they have fun but get board with finding all the darts and the load up and pump deal. you can try to shoot a single dart and can, but only for about 3 to 5 darts. then you have to start over. it works best if you just go full auto, but again you have to track down the darts and load/pump 5 min prep for 30 second fun."
1,You don't have to see it to know...,"...that it's [awful] . Backyard wrestling videos are stupid. The kids in them know nothing about wrestling. They just hit each other with weapons and severely injure each other. They've had no training. Sure, they say they spend hours practicing. But, if a kid spent hours practicing football, and yet had no training whatsoever, he'd be killed. They might as well be practicing with assault rifles. Sure, I'm in a backyard wrestling fed. But me and my frineds do it for fun. We use fake weapons (meter sticks, shoes), we use a trampoline, we do simple moves, and, if we mess up, we stop. We've had very minor injuries (cuts, bumps on heads), so we learn from those mistakes. We've never doubled an injury. The kids on these videos wrestle on concrete and dirt, they use the trampoline to do backflips onto people, and, when someone bleeds, the other guy tries to open the wound further! Not worth anyone's money."
2,"Why sell it, if you don't have it","All parts of the package came from different companies and different times. Worset thing is that I needed this equipment. The one company took a week to even tell me that they didn't have it in stuck. The second company waited 5 days to ship. Only one of the three came through. The rest where jokes for businesses. Why use Amazon when you can just find each company and insure they have the product. Can't be confident that you will even get the product. 2 weeks to get a refund for iteam not avaliable. Buy it some where else, as the cost savings only end up costing you more."
3,Plastic chirping parakeet toy,I was hoping this would sound like a parakeet but it doesn't. Just does a basic chirp. Right now my parakeet is scared to death of it but I'm sure he'll get use to it over time.
5,Great Product,"I have used Body Drench for about 17 years. Love Love Love. Great lotion, everyone should try it. They will never use anything else."
5,Kathy P.,This is hands down the best lotion out there. The dies and perfumes are not there and you can tell. It leaves skin so moist and not all that smell!
5,Great Book,"This book should be in the library of every Spanish-English, English-Spanish translator. It is chock full of valuable information and worth the price."
1,Christmas Gift???,"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son. But since it's been over a month and you still can't even locate the movie to send it to me and I have found it else where I will be canceling my order and getting my money back. I tried to give this a half a star for effort but it won't let me, you got lucky and got a full one. Thanks,"
1,Battery Stopped working after 2 days,I bought this battery for my laptop and after two days of use the battery is completely dead. I tried to contact amazon to get it replaced and they sent me on a wild goose chase.
3,Crappy cover,"The battery seems to work fine and is an inexpensive replacement, but the battery comes with two interchangeable battery covers and the one I had to use doesn't snap very tightly onto the battery. The cover will pull off when you try to remove the battery. It's a PITA."
5,Execellent,This is my first celtic cd and I can honestly say that I have not herd anything that can rival it. I have found the music soothing at all times. I even played it for my baby nephew and he fell asleep through it. Even my friends enjoyed it emensily. All of them went out to purchase the cd.
5,Hauntingly beautiful music,"Music more beautiful than this is not to be found. This is the rare album that can reach your soul. Sharifi is a master at weaving together various world music forms into songs that will never leave your heart. Each new listen is a transcendent experience. This music carries you away to other lands and ancient times. I recommend this album to everyone I know. It is sheer, blissful beauty."
4,"If you like Jai Uttal, try this...","This is one of several new releases in the ""trance"" genre -- you know: world beat meets new age.In Sharifi's debut (?), gentle synthesizer streams wash over groovy Middle-Eastern rythmns, while a series of vocalists -- ranginging from Moroccan Hassan Hakmoun to (surprise!) American Paula Cole -- sing soaring wordless melodies. Hakmoun brings his throbbing sintir to the tracks he appears on, and that adds a welcome edge.When in a mellow mood, you'll enjoy these even twelve tracks, though I doubt the CD will hold up to repeated listening.I suspect that Sharifi will be back with a more daring and interesting second release. Like Jai Uttal, who blends East-West melodies and rythms and has -- over the space of his 4 releases -- moved away from synths to real instruments, Sharifi has an interesting approach. Let's hope he makes a parallel journey."
5,Love the purse,This purse is so awesome. It is medium sized and fits lots of stuff. I highly recommend it to everyone. It is very durable.
3,"Different, interesting but woefully misses the mark","A fascintaing premise focisning on the political aspect of Socrates and presents a well crafted perspective of the citizens of Athens during the time before and during the time of the trial. However, the book""s inability to comprehend the philosophy of Plato and Socrates pushes incomplete conclusions that ironically fall into the same trap as the accusers in ancient Greece."
2,Are you buying this for the sex? Then don't...,Both movies are pretty so-so. Which is to be expected but the sex is almost non existent. There's maybe two scenes between the two movies that are over a minute in length. The rest of the scenes are pretty short and far and few in between. Despite the price I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something to get you and your partner in the mode.
4,No modifications,"I really liked the routine, beautiful scenery, great instructor, wonderful music. I enjoyed it a lot, but it does not offer modifications for difficult poses for the beginner. What if you can't do a pose right away, how do you start slowly and safely until you accomplish the correct and full pose? I am a beginner and I am not sure how to do it. But I do agree with the others, once you get better you probably won't get bored, it will still be a good workout."
3,Perhaps not for beginners,"What matters about a yoga tape or CD is whether it makes you want toget out the mat, kick off your shoes and do a bit of the practice. Agood electronic yoga teacher has the combination of clarity and enthus-iasm that gets you on the mat.Elena Brower is a yoga teacher in New York and she may have acertain celebrity because of it. However, her presence on-screenis bland and a bit distant. The pace of her instruction and the posesare not always easy to follow and a complete beginner with whom Ishared this CD was totally befuddled.In spite of these reservations, this is a usable session. I thinkit's worthwhile to have several different video yoga teachers atyour disposal to supplement trips to the yoga studio or gym and thisYoga for Beginners is useful as one of them."
3,How much of a beginner?,"That's the question this DVD back cover should have answered. I wish I had known there was one for 'absolute' beginners. I was looking for something to teach me the poses, but this one asks that you already know them, and she doesn't hold them and then coax you into correct stance, but just keeps moving. You better know some yoga before doing this. My search for the perfect beginning DVD is still on. Or - I should just take a class..."
5,beautiful,What a wonderful instruction in both the physical and breathing aspects of yoga. I am waiting for Elena Brower to produce another dvd for the intermediate level student. I have found none that compare with her instruction. Truly beautiful!
3,not in-depth,"I used this book for a geospatial math class. The book would briefly cover a math topic. We had to use a lot of handouts and outside sources to understand certain math techniques. Even having taken Calculus II, I didn't understand everything in this book without outside resources.However, I do believe this is one of the better geospatial math books. But, keep in mind that it is very thin/small and is just more of a ""review."""
1,Bad product.,"I've had my XRP tool for a couple of years now. They have all been exposed to light/occasional duty around the house. Outside of a little paint and minor scuffs you wouldn't know they were more than a couple of months old. The batteries have become nearly useless for anything but brief work and today the drill outright quit. I have just spent nearly an hour trying to contact DeWalt to no avail. Apparently customer service is a game to them. I recommend not buying this product. Go with Black and Decker instead, at least it lives down to expectations."
1,junk,"I think Dewalt batteries are junk, especially compared to makita. they always seem to wear out prematurely. Since I now own a dewalt laser level, though, I am stuck with having to buy them. Its same with so many things these days, being sold on a few good features just to get suckered into a company's expensive consumables."
3,Didn't fit,A friend gave me an 18V DeWalt drill without batteries. I was under the false impression that my 9V DeWalt charger would be able to charge the 18V battery. I did not even have to open the package to see the new battery would not fit in my charger.
1,The battery lasted only one year...not great for the price,"After only one year, the battery I purchased will not longer hold a charge. I anticipated we would get more than one summer out of the light we purchased the battery for. For the price, not much of a value."
3,Fishey MACKERAL,"Although the header of the sub-head ( a DeVries-ism should, he see it) is mis-spelled (MACKERAL PLAZA is the actual spelling)would give reverand Mackeral somthing approaching a heart attack, the book itself has more to do with the reverend giving himself a heart attack. His wife died in a canoe accident, so he blames himself. But at the church gathering where he and she were canoeing a churchmember has recorded all on Super-8 Film. His sister in law comes to his rescue(after a fashion), and all turns out well. The ususl DeVries-isms (naked under the overcoat, jacket...)"
4,My legs are filing for secession from my body,"Ok, so the instructor sounds like she's auditioning for a porno or a job as a sex-phones operator, but aside from that, this is a KILLER leg and abs workout. I used to dance ballet as a child and am horrendously out of shape now, but I have hopes of regaining definition in my legs (and well the rest of me too) and the fact that I had to slide down my stairs on my bum last night after doing this workout (I just got the dvd last night) leads me to believe that this will help me along this path :) Despite the fact that my abs and legs hate my guts, this dvd gets 2 thumbs and 10 toes up :)"
4,"""Grace and Absolute Willpower""","I wasn't sure what to expect with this DVD. I've had experience with Pilates and Jillian Michaels (two opposite extremes, if you ask me). But, I really have come to love this DVD. Every time I give this DVD my all, I always end up very sore the next day. It is great for toning arms, but it leaves your legs and butt in AMAZING shape. In order to work my abs, I try to focus on breathing and core strength as I mimic the moves of the instructor. It has definitely changed the shape of my body and I feel like the instructor gives me enough motivation without being annoying. It's almost... relaxing, with soft music and beautiful scenery. But, expect to feel the BURN. I would recommend this workout completely."
5,Great Workout!,"I received this for Christmas in hopes of finding a great ballet workout. This exceeded my expectations! Having 5 yrs. of prior ballet experience, this was perfect to maintain what I already knew. Definitely recommend!"
4,It kicked my butt!,"I do Samba Reggae and Belly Dance almost every day for 40 minutes to an hour...BUT, these exercises are AWESOME! I just finished this DVD and I have muscles hurting that I didn't know existed. I think this DVD perfectly fits a conditioning niche that I was lacking. The setting is really sunny and makes me feel happy, even when I'm thinking ""I'm gonna die"" inside! I also really benefitted from Elise's regular use of encouraging words! Very pleased overall. The only drawback (and the reason I took off one star) is that the music has a mild sort of ""Dollar-store compilation"" feel but I wouldn't call it a huge detractor. Well worth the money!"
4,Good video,I bought this before I found out I was pregnant. It's a nice and calming video. There are times that I prefer a relaxing workout instead of going to the gym and using machines and weights. This is a great alternative.
2,Not for beginners,"As a complete beginner to ballet, this DVD was quite difficult to follow. I expected the tutorial to give a basic introduction to ballet basics before going into the harder exercises, which it did not do. The instructor, though pleasant enough, begins using technical terms within the first few minutes of the video, never explaining how positions should look and feel throughout the body. She also does not thoroughly explain many of techniques. For example, she will say 'Leg up, lift up', whereas I would like to know which muscles should be used and which you should be feeling, posture, and core positioning. This is particularly irritating with most of the leg stretches, in which I'm not sure whether to push through my heels or through my toes, tighten hips or relax them, etc.It seems more suited for people who have had some sort of ballet or dance training in the past, but I would not recommend it for absolute beginners who are looking for a step-by-step guide."
1,terrible!,"Having taken ballet as a youngster, I thought this would be a good low impact ""work out."" This was a disappointment. The exercises are so simple that the DVD should really be marketed to older people. I can see how it would benefit someone who has limited mobility, but for the average adult, this is child's play."
2,Disappointing,"I love ballet, so I thought this would be a fun workout. I was wrong. If you don't already have high flexibility, you will be more frustrated then energised. The instructions are vauge. There are few moderations given, and you can easily strain a muscle. Beware if you are exercising in a room with fragile items, as there is a section of constant jumping. I left this workout annoyed at my wasted time and will not return again."
2,Not very good!,I really dislike this DVD. I think her technique is very poor and don't like her combinations much. The scenery is very beautiful but the workout is not great. There are so many better workouts based on ballet out there.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,It is very fun yet rather difficult! I love the way I feel after working out with this DVD. I am not a dancer but this dvd is very easy to learn how to do the moves as she shows them slow at first then moves on.
3,Something New to Try,"I'd been hearing about the Barre method recently, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I've NEVER done ballet before and know nothing about it. This is definitely a good workout, but I think I like workouts with a lot more movement. Here, you do a lot of repetitions of these ballet movements while standing still. Although you are supposed to be using your core muscles, I just didn't feel satisfied after the workout. There were definitely a couple exercises I had trouble completing, so it's obviously hard work! However, I live in an apartment so I don't like jumping around a lot and bugging my downstairs neighbors, so there were a few exercises I did halfway. Also, she uses a lot of terms that are new to me and I had no idea what they mean, so even after a couple times, I still don't know how to position my arms without watching her first. It was nice to try, but I prefer pilates. The Crunch series with Ellen Barrett are awesome.Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates"
3,flexibility and modifiers a must,"The locale, music and informative instructor were a plus in Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan. This is a workout for the very flexible as well as for those who are knowledgeable about modifying potentially stressful positions such as toe touches and deep knee bends! The cool down lacked upper body stretches which were needed after the lengthy arm extensions. Also, I would warm up before attempting this workout. Warm muscles are more pliant. ~ellen d. cushing"
4,Primitive and elemental it provokes strong emotions,"I heard something of this music on the BBC I was so strongly affected by it that I had to track it down. The BBC were not very helpful but Amazon.com came up with the goods as soon as I searched ""Gaelic Psalms"". My personal favourites are the pieces with more than one voice. The sound is so alien and so lonely.I can't listen to it without the hair standing up on the back of my neck.So If you want to feel the open skies of the Outer Hebrides in musical form buy this CD."
2,One can only suspend so much disbelief,"As we traipse from plot convenience to plot convenience, we learn about the lives of the one-dimensional residents of Elk River. The author has literally created a world of his own, where no outside influence may intrude. In his world, murder upon murder happen in a vacuum and nobody outside of this town notices? Yeah, right. A total ignorance of the legal process also serves as the means by which his evil character Tony Hunt gets everything done.Let's not forget the stereotypical policemen and union members in this town of 20,000 and one church.The plot was unique and had great potential. I actually enjoyed the first 1/4 of the book. It was about that time that I realized a Steven King book was more plausible. This should have been a comic book."
4,D.A. Powell fan,"To answer the other New Orleanian's question: D.A. Powell is an incredible young poet, An Iowa graduate, who has published two books of which i know, Tea, and his new one, Lunch, which isn't as good over all but which contains probably my two favorite poems of his, ""[My father and me in hollywood, fading and rising starlettes]"" and another about his father which ends with a reference to Gone with the Wind. He's one of the highlights of the anthology and everyone should check him out!"
